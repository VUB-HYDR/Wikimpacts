        "content": " Cuba,[c] officially the Republic of Cuba,[d] is an island country, comprising the island of Cuba (largest island), Isla de la Juventud, and 4,195 islands, islets and cays surrounding the main island. It is located where the northern Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic Ocean meet. Cuba is located east of the Yucat\u221a\u00b0n Peninsula (Mexico), south of both Florida and the Bahamas, west of Hispaniola (Haiti/Dominican Republic), and north of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Havana is the largest city and capital. Cuba is the third-most populous country in the Caribbean after Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with about 10 million inhabitants. It is the largest country in the Caribbean by area. The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited as early as the 4th millennium BC, with the Guanahatabey and Ta\u221a\u2260no peoples inhabiting the area at the time of Spanish colonization in the 15th century.[16] It was then a colony of Spain, through the abolition of slavery in 1886, until the Spanish\u201a\u00c4\u00ecAmerican War of 1898, when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained independence in 1902. In 1940, Cuba implemented a new constitution, but mounting political unrest culminated in the 1952 Cuban coup d'\u221a\u00a9tat and the subsequent dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.[17] The Batista government was overthrown in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement during the Cuban Revolution. That revolution established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro.[18][19] The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, and nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cuba faced a severe economic downturn in the 1990s, known as the Special Period. In 2008, Fidel Castro retired after 49 years; Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro was elected his successor. Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro retired as president in 2018 and Miguel D\u221a\u2260az-Canel was elected president by the National Assembly following parliamentary elections. Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro retired as First Secretary of the Communist Party in 2021 and D\u221a\u2260az-Canel was elected. Cuba is a socialist state, in which the role of the Communist Party is enshrined in the Constitution. Cuba has an authoritarian government where political opposition is not permitted.[20][21] Censorship is extensive and independent journalism is repressed;[22][23][24] Reporters Without Borders has characterized Cuba as one of the worst countries for press freedom.[25][24] Culturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America.[26] It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the Ta\u221a\u2260no Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of enslaved Africans and a close relationship with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Cuba is a founding member of the United Nations, G77, Non-Aligned Movement, Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, ALBA, and Organization of American States. It has one of the world's few planned economies, and its economy is dominated by tourism and the exports of skilled labor, sugar, tobacco, and coffee. Cuba has historically\u201a\u00c4\u00eebefore and during communist rule\u201a\u00c4\u00eeperformed better than other countries in the region on several socioeconomic indicators, such as literacy,[27][28] infant mortality and life expectancy. Cuba has a universal health care system which provides free medical treatment to all Cuban citizens,[29][30] although challenges include low salaries for doctors, poor facilities, poor provision of equipment, and the frequent absence of essential drugs.[31][32] A 2023 study by the Cuban Observatory of Human Rights (OCDH), estimated 88% of the population is living in extreme poverty.[33] The traditional diet is of international concern due to micronutrient deficiencies and lack of diversity. As highlighted by the World Food Programme (WFP) of the United Nations, rationed food meets only a fraction of daily nutritional needs for many Cubans, leading to health issues.[34]"

Unlike the previous settlers of Cuba, the Ta\u221a\u2260no extensively  produced pottery and engaged in intensive agriculture.[37] The earliest evidence of the Ta\u221a\u2260no people on Cuba dates to the 9th century AD.[39]  Descendants of the first settlers of Cuba persisted on the western part of the island until Columbian contact, where they were recorded as the Guanahatabey people, who lived a hunter gatherer lifestyle.[40][37]"

        "content": "After first landing on an island then called Guanahani on 12 October 1492,[41] Christopher Columbus landed on Cuba on 27 October 1492, and landing in the northeastern coast on 28 October.[42] Columbus claimed the island for the new Kingdom of Spain[43] and named it Isla Juana after John, Prince of Asturias.[44] In 1511, the first Spanish settlement was founded by Diego Vel\u221a\u00b0zquez de Cu\u221a\u00a9llar at Baracoa. Other settlements soon followed, including San Cristobal de la Habana, founded in 1514 (southern coast of the island) and then in 1519 (current place), which later became the capital (1607). The Indigenous Ta\u221a\u2260no were forced to work under the encomienda system,[45] which resembled the feudal system in medieval Europe.[46] Within a century, the Indigenous people faced high incidence of mortality due to multiple factors, primarily Eurasian infectious diseases, to which they had no natural resistance (immunity), aggravated by the harsh conditions of the repressive colonial subjugation.[47] In 1529, a measles outbreak killed two-thirds of those few Natives who had previously survived smallpox.[48][49] On 18 May 1539, conquistador Hernando de Soto departed from Havana with some 600 followers into a vast expedition through the American Southeast, in search of gold, treasure, fame and power.[50] On 1 September 1548, Gonzalo Perez de Angulo was appointed governor of Cuba. He arrived in Santiago, Cuba, on 4 November 1549, and immediately declared the liberty of all Natives.[51] He became Cuba's first permanent governor to reside in Havana instead of Santiago, and he built Havana's first church made of masonry.[52][e] By 1570, most residents of Cuba comprised a mixture of Spanish, African, and Ta\u221a\u2260no heritages.[54] Cuba developed slowly and, unlike the plantation islands of the Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. Most importantly, the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, there were 50,000 slaves on the island, compared to 60,000 in Barbados and 300,000 in Virginia; as well as 450,000 in Saint-Domingue, all of which had large-scale sugarcane plantations.[55] The Seven Years' War, which erupted in 1754 across three continents, eventually arrived in the Spanish Caribbean. Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762, a British expedition consisting of dozens of ships and thousands of troops set out from Portsmouth to capture Cuba. The British arrived on 6 June, and by August, had placed Havana under siege.[56] When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, George Pocock and the commander of the land forces George Keppel, the 3rd Earl of Albemarle, entered the city, and took control of the western part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society.[56] Though Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London on sugar merchants, fearing a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over the captured territories.[clarification needed] Less than a year after Britain captured Havana, it signed the 1763 Treaty of Paris together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Florida to Britain in exchange for Cuba.[f] Cubans constituted one of the many diverse units which fought alongside Spanish and Floridan forces during the conquest of British-controlled West Florida (1779\u201a\u00c4\u00ec81). The largest factor for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the Haitian Revolution. When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba as well, and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s of the sale of slaves in Cuba who had previously been enslaved in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing \"pearl of the Antilles\" that Haiti had been before the revolution.[57] As the historian Ada Ferrer has written, \"At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba. As slavery and colonialism collapsed in the French colony, the Spanish island underwent transformations that were almost the mirror image of Haiti's.\"[58] Estimates suggest that between 1790 and 1820 some 325,000 Africans were imported to Cuba as slaves, which was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790.[59] Although a smaller proportion of the population of Cuba was enslaved, at times, slaves arose in revolt. In 1812, the Aponte Slave Rebellion took place, but it was ultimately suppressed.[60] The population of Cuba in 1817 was 630,980 (of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 were free people of color (mixed-race), and 224,268 black slaves).[61][g] In part due to Cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by the 19th century, the practice of coartacion had developed (or \"buying oneself out of slavery\", a \"uniquely Cuban development\"), according to historian Herbert S. Klein.[63] Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated urban industries \"to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to Cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace Negro workers.\"[55] A system of diversified agriculture, with small farms and fewer slaves, served to supply the cities with produce and other goods.[55] In the 1820s, when the rest of Spain's empire in Latin America rebelled and formed independent states, Cuba remained loyal to Spain. Its economy was based on serving the empire. By 1860, Cuba had 213,167 free people of color (39% of its non-white population of 550,000).[55][h]"

        "content": "Full independence from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter Carlos Manuel de C\u221a\u00a9spedes. De C\u221a\u00a9spedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba. On 27 December 1868, he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military service.[64] The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the Ten Years' War. A great number of the rebels were volunteers from the Dominican Republic,[j] and other countries, as well as numerous Chinese indentured servants.[66][k][l] The United States declined to recognize the new Cuban government, although many European and Latin American nations did so.[69] In 1878, the Pact of Zanj\u221a\u2265n ended the conflict, with Spain promising greater autonomy to Cuba.[m] In 1879\u201a\u00c4\u00ec80, Cuban patriot Calixto Garc\u221a\u2260a attempted to start another war known as the Little War but failed to receive enough support.[71] Slavery in Cuba was abolished in 1875 but the process was completed only in 1886.[72][73] An exiled dissident named Jos\u221a\u00a9 Mart\u221a\u2260 founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party in New York City in 1892. The aim of the party was to achieve Cuban independence from Spain.[74] In January 1895, Mart\u221a\u2260 traveled to Monte Cristi and Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to join the efforts of M\u221a\u00b0ximo G\u221a\u2265mez.[74] Mart\u221a\u2260 recorded his political views in the Manifesto of Montecristi.[75] Fighting against the Spanish army began in Cuba on 24 February 1895, but Mart\u221a\u2260 was unable to reach Cuba until 11 April 1895.[74] Mart\u221a\u2260 was killed in the Battle of Dos Rios on 19 May 1895.[74] His death immortalized him as Cuba's national hero.[75] Around 200,000 Spanish troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army, which relied mostly on guerrilla and sabotage tactics. The Spaniards began a campaign of suppression. General Valeriano Weyler, the military governor of Cuba, herded the rural population into what he called reconcentrados, described by international observers as \"fortified towns\". These are often considered the prototype for 20th-century concentration camps.[76] Between 200,000[77] and 400,000 Cuban civilians died from starvation and disease in the Spanish concentration camps, numbers verified by the Red Cross and United States Senator Redfield Proctor, a former Secretary of War. American and European protests against Spanish conduct on the island followed.[78] The U.S. battleship USS Maine was sent to protect American interests, but soon after arrival, it exploded in Havana harbor and sank quickly, killing nearly three-quarters of the crew. The cause and responsibility for the sinking of the ship remained unclear after a board of inquiry. Popular opinion in the U.S., fueled by active yellow press, concluded that the Spanish were to blame and demanded action.[79] Spain and the United States declared war on each other in late April 1898.[n][o]"

Cuba gained formal independence from the U.S. on 20 May 1902, as the Republic of Cuba.[85] Under Cuba's new constitution, the U.S. retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. Under the Platt Amendment, the U.S. leased the Guant\u221a\u00b0namo Bay Naval Base from Cuba. Following disputed elections in 1906, the first president, Tom\u221a\u00b0s Estrada Palma, faced an armed revolt by independence war veterans who defeated the meager government forces.[86] The U.S. intervened by occupying Cuba and named Charles Edward Magoon as Governor for three years. Cuban historians have characterized Magoon's governorship as having introduced political and social corruption.[87] In 1908, self-government was restored when Jos\u221a\u00a9 Miguel G\u221a\u2265mez was elected president, but the U.S. continued intervening in Cuban affairs. In 1912, the Partido Independiente de Color attempted to establish a separate black republic in Oriente Province,[88] but was suppressed by General Monteagudo with considerable bloodshed. In 1924, Gerardo Machado was elected president.[89] During his administration, tourism increased markedly, and American-owned hotels and restaurants were built to accommodate the influx of tourists.[89] The tourist boom led to increases in gambling and prostitution in Cuba.[89] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a collapse in the price of sugar, political unrest, and repression.[90] Protesting students, known as the Generation of 1930, turned to violence in opposition to the increasingly unpopular Machado.[90] A general strike (in which the Communist Party sided with Machado),[91] uprisings among sugar workers, and an army revolt forced Machado into exile in August 1933. He was replaced by Carlos Manuel de C\u221a\u00a9spedes y Quesada.[90]"

Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration.[100] Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War\u00a0II\u201a\u00c4\u00eethough president Batista did suggest a joint U.S.-Latin American assault on Francoist Spain to overthrow its authoritarian regime.[101] Cuba lost six merchant ships during the war, and the Cuban Navy was credited with sinking the German submarine\u00a0U-176.[102] Batista adhered to the 1940 constitution's strictures preventing his re-election.[103] Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of the next election, in 1944.[96] Grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the Cuban political system, in particular by undermining the deeply flawed, though not entirely ineffectual, Congress and Supreme Court.[104] Carlos Pr\u221a\u2260o Socarr\u221a\u00b0s, a prot\u221a\u00a9g\u221a\u00a9 of Grau, became president in 1948.[96] The two terms of the Aut\u221a\u00a9ntico Party brought an influx of investment, which fueled an economic boom, raised living standards for all segments of society, and created a middle class in most urban areas.[105]"

        "content": "After finishing his term in 1944 Batista lived in Florida, returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952. Facing certain electoral defeat, he led a military coup that preempted the election.[106] Back in power, and receiving financial, military, and logistical support from the United States government, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans.[107] Batista outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952.[108] After the coup, Cuba had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one-third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption.[109] However, in his \"History Will Absolve Me\" speech, Fidel Castro mentioned that national issues relating to land, industrialization, housing, unemployment, education, and health were contemporary problems.[110] In 1958, Cuba was a well-advanced country in comparison to other Latin American regions.[111] Cuba was also affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in Latin America, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure \"at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants\", leading to disparities.[112] Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems.[97][113] Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs.[97] The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States[how?], became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions, manipulated by the previous government since 1948 through union \"yellowness\", supported Batista until the very end.[97][98] Batista stayed in power until he resigned in December 1958 under the pressure of the US Embassy and as the revolutionary forces headed by Fidel Castro were winning militarily (Santa Clara city, a strategic point in the middle of the country, fell into the rebels hands on December 31, in a conflict known as the Battle of Santa Clara).[114][115]"

        "content": "In the 1950s, various organizations, including some advocating armed uprising, competed for public support in bringing about political change.[116] In 1956, Fidel Castro and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht Granma in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government.[116] In 1958, Castro's July 26th Movement emerged as the leading revolutionary group.[116] The U.S. supported Castro by imposing a 1958 arms embargo against Batista's government. Batista evaded the American embargo and acquired weapons from the Dominican Republic.[p] By late 1958, the rebels had broken out of the Sierra Maestra and launched a general popular insurrection. After Castro's fighters captured Santa Clara, Batista fled with his family to the Dominican Republic on 1 January 1959. Later he went into exile on the Portuguese island of Madeira and finally settled in Estoril, near Lisbon. Fidel Castro's forces entered the capital on 8 January 1959. The liberal Manuel Urrutia Lle\u221a\u2265 became the provisional president.[122] According to Amnesty International, official death sentences from 1959 to 1987 numbered 237 of which all but 21 were carried out.[123] The vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 Revolution were policemen, politicians, and informers of the Batista regime accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions had widespread popular support among the Cuban population.[124] The United States government initially reacted favorably to the Cuban Revolution, seeing it as part of a movement to bring democracy to Latin America.[126] Castro's legalization of the Communist Party and the hundreds of executions of Batista agents, policemen, and soldiers that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries.[126] The promulgation of the Agrarian Reform Law, expropriating thousands of acres of farmland (including from large U.S. landholders), further worsened relations.[126][127] In response, between 1960 and 1964 the U.S. imposed a range of sanctions, eventually including a total ban on trade between the countries and a freeze on all Cuban-owned assets in the U.S.[128] In February 1960, Castro signed a commercial agreement with Soviet Vice-Premier Anastas Mikoyan.[126] In March 1960, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave his approval to a CIA plan to arm and train a group of Cuban refugees to overthrow the Castro government. The invasion (known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion) took place on 14 April 1961, during the term of President John F. Kennedy.[127] About 1,400 Cuban exiles disembarked at the Bay of Pigs. Cuban troops and local militias defeated the invasion, killing over 100 invaders and taking the remainder prisoner.[127] In January 1962, Cuba was suspended from the Organization of American States (OAS), and later the same year the OAS started to impose sanctions against Cuba of similar nature to the U.S. sanctions.[129] The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 almost sparked World War III.[130][131] In 1962 American generals proposed Operation Northwoods which would entail committing terrorist attacks in American cities and against refugees and falsely blaming the attacks on the Cuban government, manufacturing a reason for the United States to invade Cuba. This plan was rejected by President Kennedy.[132] By 1963, Cuba was moving towards a full-fledged communist system modeled on the USSR.[133] During the Cold War, Cuban forces were deployed to all corners of Africa, either as military advisors or as combatants.[134] In 1963, Cuba sent 686 troops together with 22 tanks and other military equipment to support Algeria in the Sand War against Morocco.[135] The Cuban forces remained in Algeria for over a year, providing training to the Algerian army.[136] In 1964, Cuba organized a meeting of Latin American communists in Havana and stoked a civil war in the capital of the Dominican Republic in 1965, which prompted 20,000 U.S. troops to intervene there.[54] Che Guevara engaged in guerrilla activities in Africa and was killed in 1967 while attempting to start a revolution in Bolivia.[54] During the 1970s, Fidel Castro dispatched tens of thousands of troops in support of Soviet-backed wars in Africa. He supported the MPLA in Angola (Angolan Civil War) and Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia (Ogaden War).[137] In November 1975, Cuba deployed more than 65,000 troops and 400 Soviet-made tanks in Angola in one of the fastest military mobilizations in history.[138] South Africa developed nuclear weapons due to the threat to its security posed by the presence of large numbers of Cuban troops in Angola.[139] In 1976 and again in 1988 at the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, the Cubans alongside their MPLA allies defeated UNITA rebels and apartheid South African forces.[140][q] In December 1977, Cuba sent its combat troops from Angola, the People's Republic of the Congo, and the Caribbean to Ethiopia,[136] assisted by mechanized Soviet battalions, to help defeat a Somali invasion. On 24 January 1978, Ethiopian and Cuban troops counterattacked, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the Somali forces.[136] In February, Cuban troops launched a major offensive and forced the Somali army back into its own territory.[136][142] Cuban forces remained in Ethiopia until 9 September 1989.[136] Despite Cuba's small size and the long distance separating it from the Middle East, Castro's Cuba played an active role in the region during the Cold War. In 1972, a major Cuban military mission consisting of tank, air, and artillery specialists was dispatched to South Yemen. Cuban military advisors were sent to Iraq in the mid-1970s but their mission was canceled after Iraq invaded Iran in 1980.[136] The Cubans were also involved in the Syrian-Israeli War of Attrition (November 1973\u201a\u00c4\u00ecMay 1974) that followed the Yom Kippur War (October 1973).[143] Israeli sources reported the presence of a Cuban tank brigade in the Golan Heights, which was supported by two brigades.[144] The Israelis and the Cuban-Syrian tank forces engaged in battle on the Golan front.[145]:\u200a37\u201a\u00c4\u00ec38 The standard of living in the 1970s was \"extremely spartan\" and discontent was rife.[146] Fidel Castro admitted the failures of economic policies in a 1970 speech.[146] In 1975, the OAS lifted its sanctions against Cuba, with the approval of 16 member states, including the United States. The U.S., however, maintained its own sanctions.[129] In 1979, the U.S. objected to the presence of Soviet combat troops on the island.[54] Following the 1983 coup that resulted in the execution of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and establishment of the military government led by Hudson Austin, U.S. forces invaded Grenada in 1983, overthrowing the Government. Most resistance came from Cuban construction workers, while the Grenadan People's Revolutionary Army and militia surrendered without putting up much of a fight. 24 Cubans were killed, with only 2 of them being professional soldiers, and the remainder were expelled from the island. U.S. casualties amounted to 19 killed, 116 wounded, and 9 helicopters destroyed. During the 1970s and 1980s, Castro supported Marxist insurgencies in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Cuba gradually withdrew its troops from Angola in 1989\u201a\u00c4\u00ec91.[136] An important psychological and political aspect of the Cuban military involvement in Africa was the significant presence of black or mixed-race soldiers among the Cuban forces.[136][r] According to one source, more than 300,000 Cuban military personnel and civilian experts were deployed in Africa. The source also states that out of the 50,000 Cubans sent to Angola, half contracted AIDS and that 10,000 Cubans died as a consequence of their military actions in Africa.[136] Soviet troops began to withdraw from Cuba in September 1991,[54] and Castro's rule was severely tested in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse in December 1991 (known in Cuba as the Special Period). The country faced a severe economic downturn following the withdrawal of Soviet subsidies worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually, resulting in effects such as food and fuel shortages.[148][149] The government did not accept American donations of food, medicines and cash until 1993.[148] On 5 August 1994, state security dispersed protesters in a spontaneous protest in Havana. From the start of the crisis until 1995, Cuba saw its gross domestic product (GDP) shrink by 35%. It took another five years for its GDP to reach pre-crisis levels.[150] Cuba has since found a new source of aid and support in the People's Republic of China. In addition, Hugo Ch\u221a\u00b0vez, then president of Venezuela, and Evo Morales, former president of Bolivia, became allies and both countries are major oil and gas exporters. In 2003, the government arrested and imprisoned a large number of civil activists, a period known as the \"Black Spring\".[151][152] In February 2008, Fidel Castro resigned as President of the State Council due to the serious gastrointestinal illness which he had suffered since July 2006.[153] On 24 February, the National Assembly elected his brother Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro the new president.[154] In his inauguration speech, Ra\u221a\u222bl promised that some of the restrictions on freedom in Cuba would be removed.[155] In March 2009, Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro removed some of his brother's appointees.[156] On 3 June 2009, the Organization of American States adopted a resolution to end the 47-year ban on Cuban membership of the group.[157] The resolution stated, however, that full membership would be delayed until Cuba was \"in conformity with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS\".[129] Fidel Castro wrote that Cuba would not rejoin the OAS, which, he said, was a \"U.S. Trojan horse\" and \"complicit\" in actions taken by the U.S. against Cuba and other Latin American nations.[158] Effective 14 January 2013, Cuba ended the requirement established in 1961, that any citizens who wish to travel abroad were required to obtain an expensive government permit and a letter of invitation.[159][160][161] In 1961 the Cuban government had imposed broad restrictions on travel to prevent the mass emigration of people after the 1959 revolution;[162] it approved exit visas only on rare occasions.[163] Requirements were simplified: Cubans need only a passport and a national ID card to leave; and they are allowed to take their young children with them for the first time.[164] However, a passport costs on average five months' salary. Observers expect that Cubans with paying relatives abroad are most likely to be able to take advantage of the new policy.[165] In the first year of the program, over 180,000 left Cuba and returned.\nAs of December\u00a02014[update], talks with Cuban officials and American officials, including President Barack Obama, resulted in the release of Alan Gross, fifty-two political prisoners, and an unnamed non-citizen agent of the United States in return for the release of three Cuban agents currently imprisoned in the United States. Additionally, while the embargo between the United States and Cuba was not immediately lifted, it was relaxed to allow import, export, and certain limited commerce.[166] Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro stepped down from the presidency on 19 April 2018 and Miguel D\u221a\u2260az-Canel was elected president by the National Assembly following parliamentary elections. Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro remained the First Secretary of the Communist Party and retained broad authority, including oversight over the president.[167] Cuba approved a new constitution in 2019. The optional vote attracted 84.4% of eligible voters. 90% of those who voted approved of the new constitution and 9% opposed it. The new constitution states that the Communist Party is the only legitimate political party, describes access to health and education as fundamental rights, imposes presidential term limits, enshrines the right to legal representation upon arrest, recognizes private property, and strengthens the rights of multinationals investing with the state.[168] Any form of discrimination harmful to human dignity is banned under the new constitution.[169] Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro announced at the Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, which began on 16 April 2021, that he was retiring as secretary of the Communist Party.[170] His successor, Miguel D\u221a\u2260az-Canel, was voted in on 19 April.[171] In July 2021, there were several large protests against the government under the banner of Patria y Vida. Cuban exiles also conducted protests overseas.[172][173][174] The song associated with the movement received international acclaim including a Latin Grammy Award.[175] On 25 September 2022, Cuba approved a referendum which amended the Family Code to legalise same-sex marriage and allow surrogate pregnancy and same-sex adoption. Gender reassignment surgery and transgender hormone therapy are provided free of charge under Cuba's national healthcare system. The proposed changes were supported by the government and opposed by conservatives and parts of the opposition. Official policies of the Cuban government from 1959 until the 1990s were hostile towards homosexuality, with the LGBT community marginalized on the basis of heteronormativity, traditional gender roles, and strict criteria for moralism.[169][176]"

It lies between latitudes 19\u00ac\u221e and 24\u00ac\u221eN, and longitudes 74\u00ac\u221e and 85\u00ac\u221eW. Florida (Key West, Florida) is about 150\u00a0km (93 miles) across the Straits of Florida to the north and northwest, and The Bahamas (Cay Lobos) 22.5\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) to the north. Mexico lies 210\u00a0km (130.5\u00a0mi) west across the Yucat\u221a\u00b0n Channel (to the closest tip of Cabo Catoche in the State of Quintana Roo). Haiti is 77\u00a0km (47.8\u00a0mi) east and Jamaica 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) south. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the Colorados Archipelago on the northwestern coast, the Sabana-Camag\u221a\u00baey Archipelago on the north-central Atlantic coast, the Jardines de la Reina on the south-central coast and the Canarreos Archipelago on the southwestern coast. The main island, named Cuba, is 1,250\u00a0km (780\u00a0mi) long, constituting most of the nation's land area (104,338\u00a0km2 or 40,285\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and is the largest island in the Caribbean and 17th-largest island in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the Sierra Maestra mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is Pico Turquino (1,974\u00a0m or 6,476\u00a0ft). The second-largest island is Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of 2,204\u00a0km2 (851\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Cuba has an official area (land area) of 109,884\u00a0km2 (42,426\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Its area is 110,860\u00a0km2 (42,803\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) including coastal and territorial waters."

The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of Hong Kong, which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is 21\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC (70\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF) in January and 27\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC (81\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF) in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico combine to make the country prone to frequent hurricanes. These are most common in September and October. Hurricane Irma hit the island on 8 September 2017, with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (72\u00a0m/s),[177] at the Camag\u221a\u00baey Archipelago; the storm reached Ciego de Avila province around midnight and continued to pound Cuba the next day.[178] The worst damage was in the keys north of the main island. Hospitals, warehouses and factories were damaged; much of the north coast was without electricity. By that time, nearly a million people, including tourists, had been evacuated.[179] The Varadero resort area also reported widespread damage; the government believed that repairs could be completed before the start of the main tourist season.[180] Subsequent reports indicated that ten people had been killed during the storm, including seven in Havana, most during building collapses. Sections of the capital had been flooded.[180]"

The Cuban trogon or tocororo is the national bird of Cuba and an endemic species. Hedychium coronarium, named mariposa in Cuba, is the national flower.[184] Cuba is home to six terrestrial ecoregions: Cuban moist forests, Cuban dry forests, Cuban pine forests, Cuban wetlands, Cuban cactus scrub, and Greater Antilles mangroves.[185] It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.4/10, ranking it 102nd globally out of 172 countries.[186] According to a 2012 study, Cuba is the only country in the world to meet the conditions of sustainable development put forth by the WWF.[187]"

The Constitution of 1976, which defined Cuba as a socialist republic, was replaced by the Constitution of 1992, which is \"guided by the ideas of Jos\u221a\u00a9 Mart\u221a\u2260 and the political and social ideas of Marx, Engels and Lenin.\"[188] The constitution describes the Communist Party of Cuba as the \"leading force of society and of the state\".[188] The political system in Cuba reflects the Marxist\u201a\u00c4\u00ecLeninist concept of democratic centralism.[189]:\u200a38 The First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba is the most senior position in the one-party state.[190] The First Secretary leads the Politburo and the Secretariat, making the office holder the most powerful person in Cuban government.[191] Members of both councils are elected by the National Assembly of People's Power.[188] The President of Cuba, who is also elected by the Assembly, serves for five years and since the ratification of the 2019 Constitution, there is a limit of two consecutive five-year terms.[188] The People's Supreme Court serves as Cuba's highest judicial branch of government. It is also the court of last resort for all appeals against the decisions of provincial courts. Cuba's national legislature, the National Assembly of People's Power (Asamblea Nacional de Poder Popular), is the supreme organ of power; 474 members serve five-year terms.[188] The assembly meets twice a year; between sessions legislative power is held by the 31 member Council of Ministers. Candidates for the Assembly are approved by public referendum. All Cuban citizens over 16 who have not been convicted of a criminal offense can vote.[192] Article 131 of the Constitution states that voting shall be \"through free, equal and secret vote\".[188] Article 136 states: \"In order for deputies or delegates to be considered elected they must get more than half the number of valid votes cast in the electoral districts\".[188] There are elections in Cuba, but they are not considered democratic.[193][194] In elections for the National Assembly of People's Power there is only one candidate for each seat, and candidates are nominated by committees that are firmly controlled by the Communist Party.[195][196] Most legislative districts elect multiple representatives to the Assembly. Voters can select individual candidates on their ballot, select every candidate, or leave every question blank, with no option to vote against candidates.[197][198] No political party is permitted to nominate candidates or campaign on the island, including the Communist Party.[199] The Communist Party of Cuba has held six party congress meetings since 1975. In 2011, the party stated that there were 800,000 members, and representatives generally constitute at least half of the Councils of state and the National Assembly. The remaining positions are filled by candidates nominally without party affiliation. Other political parties campaign and raise finances internationally, while activity within Cuba by opposition groups is minimal. Cuba is considered an authoritarian regime according to The Economist's Democracy Index[200] and Freedom in the World reports.[201]  More specifically, Cuba is considered a military dictatorship in the Democracy-Dictatorship Index, and has been described as \"a militarized society\"[202] with the armed forces having long been the most powerful institution in the country.[203] In February 2013, President of the State Council Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro announced he would resign in 2018, ending his five-year term, and that he hopes to implement permanent term limits for future Cuban presidents, including age limits.[204] After Fidel Castro died on 25 November 2016, the Cuban government declared a nine-day mourning period. During the mourning period, Cuban citizens were prohibited from playing loud music, partying, and drinking alcohol.[205] Miguel D\u221a\u2260az-Canel was elected president on 18 April 2018 after the resignation of Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro. On 19 April 2021, D\u221a\u2260az-Canel became First Secretary of the Communist Party. He is the first non-Castro to be in such top position since the Cuban revolution of 1959.[206]"

Cuba supported Algeria in 1961\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1965[209] and sent tens of thousands of troops to Angola during the Angolan Civil War.[210] Other countries that featured Cuban involvement include Ethiopia,[211][212] Guinea,[213] Guinea-Bissau,[214] Mozambique,[215] and Yemen.[216] Lesser known actions include the 1959 missions to the Dominican Republic.[217] The expedition failed, but a prominent monument to its members was erected in their memory in Santo Domingo by the Dominican government, and they feature prominently at the country's Memorial Museum of the Resistance.[218] In 2008, the European Union (EU) and Cuba agreed to resume full relations and cooperation activities.[219] Cuba is a founding member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas.[220] At the end of 2012, tens of thousands of Cuban medical personnel worked abroad,[221] with as many as 30,000 doctors in Venezuela alone via the two countries' oil-for-doctors programme.[222] In 1996, the United States, then under President Bill Clinton, brought in the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, better known as the Helms\u201a\u00c4\u00ecBurton Act.[223][s] In 2009, United States President Barack Obama stated on 17 April, in Trinidad and Tobago that \"the United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba\",[225] and reversed the Bush Administration's prohibition on travel and remittances by Cuban-Americans from the United States to Cuba.[226] Five years later, an agreement between the United States and Cuba, popularly called the \"Cuban thaw\", brokered in part by Canada and Pope Francis, began the process of restoring international relations between the two countries. They agreed to release political prisoners and the United States began the process of creating an embassy in Havana.[227][228][229][230][231] This was realized on 30 June 2015, when Cuba and the U.S. reached a deal to reopen embassies in their respective capitals on 20 July 2015[232] and reestablish diplomatic relations.[233] Earlier in the same year, the White House announced that President Obama would remove Cuba from the American government's list of nations that sponsor terrorism,[234][235] which Cuba reportedly welcomed as \"fair\".[236] On 17 September 2017, the United States considered closing its Cuban embassy following mysterious medical symptoms experienced by its staff.[237] In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing international isolation of Russia, Cuba emerged as one of the few countries that maintained friendly relations with the Russian Federation.[238][239] Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel visited Vladimir Putin in Moscow in November 2022, where the two leaders opened a monument of Fidel Castro, as well as speaking out against U.S. sanctions against Russia and Cuba.[240]"

This action was initiated in response to a wave of nationalizations that impacted American properties valued at over US$1 billion, the then U.S.[241] President, Dwight Eisenhower, instated an embargo that prohibited all exports to Cuba, with the exception of medicines and certain foods.[241] This measure was intensified in 1962 under the administration of John F. Kennedy, extending the restrictions to Cuban imports, based on the Foreign Assistance Act approved by Congress in 1961.[241] During the Missile Crisis in 1962, the United States even imposed a naval blockade on Cuba, but this was lifted following the resolution of the crisis. The embargo, however, remained in place and has been modified on several occasions over the years.[241] The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 states that sanctions will continue \"so long as it continues to refuse to move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights\".[242][non-primary source needed] American diplomat Lester D. Mallory wrote an internal memo on April 6, 1960, arguing in favor of an embargo: \"The only foreseeable means of alienating internal support is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship. [...] to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.\"[243][244] The UN General Assembly has passed a resolution every year since 1992 condemning the embargo and stating that it violates the Charter of the United Nations and international law.[245] Cuba considers the embargo a human rights violation.[246] The impact and effectiveness of the embargo have been subjects of intense debate. While some argue it has been \"extraordinarily porous\" and isn't the primary cause of Cuba's economic hardships, others see it as a pressure mechanism aimed at driving change in the Cuban government.[241] According to Arturo Lopez Levy, a professor of international relations, it would be more appropriate to refer to the measure as a \"blockade\" or \"siege\", as it goes beyond mere trade restrictions.[241] Other critics of the Cuban government argue that the embargo has been used by the government as an excuse to justify its own economic and political shortcomings.[241] On 17 December 2014, United States President Barack Obama announced the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba, pushing for Congress to put an end to the embargo,[247] as well as the United States-run Guantanamo Bay detention camp. These diplomatic improvements were later reversed by the Trump Administration, which enacted new rules and re-enforced the business and travel restrictions which were loosened by the Obama Administration.[248] These sanctions were inherited and strengthened by the Biden Administration.[249] Despite the embargo, Cuba has maintained trade relations with other countries.[241] According to 2019 data, China stands as Cuba's main trading partner, followed by countries such as Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Cyprus. Cuba's main exports include tobacco, sugar, and alcoholic beverages, while it primarily imports chicken meat, wheat, corn, and condensed milk.[241]"

Most of the means of production are owned and run by the government and most of the labor force is employed by the state. Recent years have seen a trend toward more private sector employment. By 2006, public sector employment was 78% and private sector 22%, compared to 91.8% to 8.2% in 1981.[267] Government spending is 78.1% of GDP.[268] Since the early 2010s, following the initial market reforms, it has become popular to describe the economy as being, or moving toward, market socialism.[269][270][271] Any firm that hires a Cuban must pay the Cuban government, which in turn pays the employee in Cuban pesos.[272] The average monthly wage as of July\u00a02013[update] was 466 Cuban pesos\u201a\u00c4\u00eeabout US$19.[273] However, after a reform in January 2021, the minimum wage is about 2100 CUP (US$18) and the median wage is about 4000 CUP (US$33).[citation needed] Cuba had Cuban pesos (CUP) set at par with the US dollar before 1959.[273] Every Cuban household has a ration book (known as libreta) entitling it to a monthly supply of food and other staples, which are provided at nominal cost.[274] According to the Havana Consulting Group, in 2014, remittances to Cuba amounted to US$3,129 million, the seventh highest in Latin America.[275] In 2019, remittances had grown to US$6,616 million, but dropped down to US$1,967 million in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[276] The pandemic has also devastated Cuba's tourist industry, which along with a tightening of U.S. sanctions, has led to large increase in emigration among younger working-age Cubans. It has been described as a crisis that is \"threatening the stability\" of Cuba,  which \"already has one of the hemisphere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s oldest populations\".[277] According to a controversial 2023 report by the Cuban Observatory of Human Rights (OCDH), 88% of Cuban citizens live in extreme poverty. The report stated that Cubans were concerned about food security and the difficulty in acquiring basic goods.[278] According to the World Bank, Cuba's GDP per capita was $9,500 as of 2020.[279] But according to the CIA World Factbook, it was $12,300 as of 2016.[280] The United Nations Development Programme gave Cuba a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.764 in 2021.[281] The same United Nations agency estimated the country's Multidimensional Poverty Index of 0.003 in 2023.[282] In 2005, Cuba had exports of US$2.4 billion, ranking 114 of 226 world countries, and imports of US$6.9 billion, ranking 87 of 226 countries.[283] Its major export partners are Canada 17.7%, China 16.9%, Venezuela 12.5%, Netherlands 9%, and Spain 5.9% (2012).[284] Cuba's major exports are sugar, nickel, tobacco, fish, medical products, citrus fruits, and coffee;[284] imports include food, fuel, clothing, and machinery. Cuba presently holds debt in an amount estimated at $13 billion,[285] approximately 38% of GDP.[286] According to The Heritage Foundation, Cuba is dependent on credit accounts that rotate from country to country.[287] Cuba's prior 35% supply of the world's export market for sugar has declined to 10% due to a variety of factors, including a global sugar commodity price drop that made Cuba less competitive on world markets.[288] It was announced in 2008 that wage caps would be abandoned to improve the nation's productivity.[289] Cuba's leadership has called for reforms in the country's agricultural system. In 2008, Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro began enacting agrarian reforms to boost food production, as at that time 80% of food was imported. The reforms aim to expand land use and increase efficiency.[290] Venezuela supplies Cuba with an estimated 110,000 barrels (17,000\u00a0m3) of oil per day in exchange for money and the services of some 44,000 Cubans, most of them medical personnel, in Venezuela.[291][292] In 2010[update], Cubans were allowed to build their own houses. According to Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro, they could now improve their houses, but the government would not endorse these new houses or improvements.[293] There is virtually no homelessness in Cuba,[294][295] and 85% of Cubans own their homes[296] and pay no property taxes or mortgage interest. Mortgage payments may not exceed 10% of a household's combined income.[citation needed]. On 2 August 2011, The New York Times reported that Cuba reaffirmed its intent to legalize \"buying and selling\" of private property before the year's end. According to experts, the private sale of property could \"transform Cuba more than any of the economic reforms announced by President Ra\u221a\u222bl Castro's government\".[297] It would cut more than one million state jobs, including party bureaucrats who resist the changes.[298] The reforms created what some call \"New Cuban Economy\".[299][300] In October 2013, Ra\u221a\u222bl said he intended to merge the two currencies, but as of August\u00a02016[update], the dual currency system remains in force. In 2016, the Miami Herald wrote, \"... about 27 percent of Cubans earn under $50 per month; 34 percent earn the equivalent of $50 to $100 per month; and 20 percent earn $101 to $200. Twelve percent reported earning $201 to $500 a month; and almost 4 percent said their monthly earnings topped $500, including 1.5 percent who said they earned more than $1,000.\"[301] In May 2019, Cuba imposed rationing of staples such as chicken, eggs, rice, beans, soap and other basic goods. (Some two-thirds of food in the country is imported.) A spokesperson blamed the increased U.S. trade embargo although economists believe that an equally important problem is the massive decline of aid from Venezuela and the failure of Cuba's state-run oil company which had subsidized fuel costs.[302] In June 2019, the government announced an increase in public sector wages of about 300%, specifically for teachers and health personnel.[303] In October, the government allowed stores to purchase house equipment and similar items, using international currency, and send it to Cuba by emigration. The leaders of the government recognized that the new measures were unpopular but necessary to contain the capital flight to other countries as Panam\u221a\u00b0 where Cuban citizens traveled and imported items to resell on the island. Other measures included allowing private companies to export and import, through state companies, resources to produce products and services in Cuba. On January 1, 2021, Cuba's dual currency system was formally ended, and the convertible Cuban peso (CUC) was phased out, leaving the Cuban peso (CUP) as the country's sole currency unit. Cuban citizens had until June 2021 to exchange their CUCs. However, this devalued the Cuban peso and caused economic problems for people who had been previously paid in CUCs, particularly workers in the tourism industry.[304][305][306] Also, in February, the government dictated new measures to the private sector, with prohibitions for only 124 activities,[307] in areas like national security, health and educational services.[308] The wages were increased again, between 4 and 9 times, for all the sectors. Also, new facilities were allowed to the state companies, with much more autonomy.[305] The first problem with the new reform, in terms of public opinion, were electricity prices, but that was amended quickly. Other measures corrected were in the prices for private farmers.[citation needed] In July 2020, Cuba opened new stores accepting only foreign currency while simultaneously eliminating a special tax on the U.S. dollar[309] to combat an economic crisis arising initially due to economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration,[310] then later worsened by a lack of tourism during the coronavirus pandemic. These economic sanctions have since been sustained by the Biden administration.[311]"

Cuba is also a major producer of refined cobalt, a by-product of nickel mining.[314] Oil exploration in 2005 by the US Geological Survey revealed that the North Cuba Basin could produce about 4.6 billion barrels (730,000,000\u00a0m3) to 9.3 billion barrels (1.48\u221a\u00f3109\u00a0m3) of oil.

Promoting these resources could contribute to regional development, prosperity, and well-being.[321] The Cuban Justice minister downplays allegations of widespread sex tourism.[322] According to a Government of Canada travel advice website, \"Cuba is actively working to prevent child sex tourism, and a number of tourists, including Canadians, have been convicted of offenses related to the corruption of minors aged 16 and under. Prison sentences range from 7 to 25 years.\"[323] Some tourist facilities were extensively damaged on 8 September 2017 when Hurricane Irma hit the island. The storm made landfall in the Camag\u221a\u00baey Archipelago; the worst damage was in the keys north of the main island, however, and not in the most significant tourist areas.[179]"

Although the country's population has grown by about four million people since 1961, the rate of growth slowed during that period, and the population began to decline in 2006, due to the country's low fertility rate (1.43 children per woman) coupled with emigration.[326]"

In fact, the Minority Rights Group International determined that \"An objective assessment of the situation of Afro-Cubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution. Estimates of the percentage of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously, ranging from 34% to 62%\".[330] A 2014 study found that, based on ancestry informative markers (AIM), autosomal genetic ancestry in Cuba is 72% European, 20% African, and 8% Indigenous.[331] Asians make up about 1% of the population, and are largely of Chinese ancestry, followed by Japanese and Filipino.[332][333] Many are descendants of farm laborers brought to the island by Spanish and American contractors during the 19th and early 20th century.[334] The current recorded number of Cubans with Chinese ancestry is 114,240.[335] Afro-Cubans are descended primarily from the Yoruba people, Bantu people from the Congo basin, Kalabari tribe and Arar\u221a\u00b0 from the Dahomey, as well as several thousand North African refugees, most notably the Sahrawi Arabs of Western Sahara.[336]"

        "content": "Post-revolution Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration, which has led to a large and influential diaspora community. During the three decades after January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social classes\u201a\u00c4\u00eeconstituting 10% of the total population\u201a\u00c4\u00eeemigrated to the United States, a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the U.S. from the Caribbean as a whole during that period.[340][341][342][343][344] Prior to 13 January 2013, Cuban citizens could not travel abroad, leave or return to Cuba without first obtaining official permission along with applying for a government-issued passport and travel visa, which was often denied.[345] Those who left the country typically did so by sea, in small boats and fragile rafts. On 9 September 1994, the U.S. and Cuban governments agreed that the U.S. would grant at least 20,000 visas annually in exchange for Cuba's pledge to prevent further unlawful departures on boats.[346] In 2023, Cuba is undergoing its most severe socioeconomic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, leading to a record number of Cubans fleeing the island.[347] In 2022 alone, the number of Cubans trying to enter the United States, primarily through the Mexican border, surged from 39,000 in 2021 to over 224,000. Many have resorted to selling their homes at very low prices to afford one-way flights to Nicaragua, hoping to travel through Mexico to reach the U.S.[347] For those remaining among the island's 11 million inhabitants, life grows increasingly desperate. Internal migration has led to overpopulation in the capital, Havana, resulting in people living in makeshift shelters or overcrowded buildings, some of which are on the brink of collapse. The island's persistent shortages of food and medicine can be attributed to the U.S. trade embargo in place since 1962 and stringent government control over the economy since 1959. Regular power outages harken back to the early 1990s, a time when Soviet subsidies ended, plunging the island into economic hardship.[347] Cuba's \"Special Period\" saw the country relying heavily on foreign tourism and the earnings of nationals working abroad. The pandemic, however, severely affected this revenue stream, decreasing the number of tourists by 75% in 2020. Monetary reforms in 2021 introduced shocks of inflation, further exacerbating the country's food scarcity and boosting the black market's prominence.[347] Despite the increasing hardships, the Cuban spirit remains resilient. Access to the internet since 2018 and widespread use of social media have fueled calls for political and economic liberalization. The power of the internet was evident during the Cuban protests of 2021, which were promptly suppressed by the police, with many prominent artists and bloggers detained.[347] As of 2013 the top emigration destinations were the United States, Spain, Italy, Puerto Rico, and Mexico.[348] Following a tightening of U.S. sanctions and damage to the tourist industry by the COVID-19 pandemic, emigration has accelerated. In 2022, more than 2% of the population (almost 250,000 Cubans out of 11 million) migrated to the United States, and thousands more went to other countries, a number \"larger than the 1980 Mariel boatlift and the 1994 Cuban rafter crisis combined\", which were Cuba's previous largest migration events.[277]"

Religious freedom increased through the 1980s,[355] with the government amending the constitution in 1992 to drop the state's characterization as atheistic.[356] Roman Catholicism is the largest religion, with its origins in Spanish colonization. Despite less than half of the population identifying as Catholics in 2006, it nonetheless remains the dominant faith.[287] Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in 1998 and 2011, respectively, and Pope Francis visited Cuba in September 2015.[357][358] Prior to each papal visit, the Cuban government pardoned prisoners as a humanitarian gesture.[359][360] The government's relaxation of restrictions on house churches in the 1990s led to an explosion of Pentecostalism, with some groups claiming as many as 100,000 members. However, Evangelical Protestant denominations, organized into the umbrella Cuban Council of Churches, remain much more vibrant and powerful.[361] The religious landscape of Cuba is also strongly defined by syncretisms of various kinds. Christianity is often practiced in tandem with Santer\u221a\u2260a, a mixture of Catholicism and mostly African faiths, which include a number of cults. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (the Virgin of Cobre) is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and a symbol of Cuban culture. In Santer\u221a\u2260a, she has been syncretized with the goddess Oshun. A breakdown of the followers of Afro-Cuban religions showed that most practitioners of Palo Mayombe were black and dark brown-skinned, most practitioners of Vod\u221a\u222b were medium brown and light brown-skinned, and most practitioners of Santeria were light brown and white-skinned.[362] Cuba also hosts small communities of Jews (500 in 2012), Muslims, and members of the Bah\u221a\u00b0\u00a0\u00ba\u221a\u2260 Faith.[363] Several well-known Cuban religious figures have operated outside the island, including the  humanitarian and author Jorge Armando P\u221a\u00a9rez."

School attendance is compulsory from ages six to the end of basic secondary education (normally at age 15), and all students, regardless of age or gender, wear school uniforms with the color denoting grade level. Primary education lasts for six years, secondary education is divided into basic and pre-university education.[364] Cuba's literacy rate of 99.8 percent[284][365] is the tenth-highest globally, largely due to the provision of free education at every level.[366] Cuba's high school graduation rate is 94 percent.[367] Higher education is provided by universities, higher institutes, higher pedagogical institutes, and higher polytechnic institutes. The Cuban Ministry of Higher Education operates a distance education program that provides regular afternoon and evening courses in rural areas for agricultural workers.

This group also provides technical information for the production of these drugs.[385] Isolated from the West by the US embargo, Cuba developed the successful lung cancer vaccine, Cimavax, which is now available to US researchers for the first time, along with other novel Cuban cancer treatments. The vaccine has been available for free to the Cuban population since 2011.[386] According to Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center CEO Candace Johnson: \"They've had to do more with less, so they've had to be even more innovative with how they approach things.

The end of the thaw under the Trump Administration has resulted in a tightening of travel restrictions, making it harder for U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba for treatment.[388] In 2015, Cuba became the first country to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis,[389] a milestone hailed by the World Health Organization as \"one of the greatest public health achievements possible\".[390]"

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), an entity of the United Nations, the average diet in Cuba lacks adequate nutritional quality. This is attributed to various factors, including limited availability of nutrient-rich foods, socioeconomic issues, and poor dietary habits.[34] The WFP's annual report on Cuba supports previous testimonies and evidence, pointing to a concerning situation. Even though the country has rolled out food subsidy programs, many backed by the WFP, the populace's diet remains nutritionally insufficient. Specifically, rationed food covers only a small percentage of the daily energy, protein, and fat requirements for the population aged 14 to 60.[34] Such deficiencies have led to health issues like overweight and obesity, largely due to a diet high in sugars and salts. Additionally, there is a significant disparity in accessing proper nutrition. Individuals without access to foreign currencies and remittances are the most affected. The inadequacy of the minimum wage to meet recommended nutritional requirements is another concern highlighted in the report.[34] The political and socioeconomic landscape has influenced this scenario. The implementation of the \"Tarea Ordenamiento,\" an economic reform that removed many food subsidies, has spurred alarming inflation, intensifying the shortage of basic foods like cereals, vegetables, dairy, and meat. As a result, Cuban households spend between 55% and 65% of their income on food, a proportion deemed disproportionate compared to international standards.[34] Nevertheless, the report acknowledges the Cuban government's efforts in areas like social protection and universal access to basic services. It highlights Cuba's position in the Human Development Report 2021-2022 and the extensive COVID-19 vaccination coverage.[34] To address food security challenges, the WFP has enhanced its collaboration with Cuban authorities. In 2022, the organization procured essential foods and macronutrients worth $10.7 million in response to alarming figures about anemia prevalence in infants.[34] Amid this nutritional crisis, international interventions and collaborations are anticipated to alleviate the food and nutrition issues plaguing the Cuban populace.[34]"

During the Republican period, large buildings were built, such as the Capitol, modeled after the one in Washington, and other large buildings such as the Focsa and the Habana Hilton, later the Habana Libre. One of the most outstanding Cuban architects of the second half of the 20th century was Antonio Quintana Simonetti. After the triumph of the Revolution, architecture received a strong Soviet influence with its desire for symmetry and space saving, and entire new neighborhoods were built in the style of the working-class quarters of Moscow or Minsk. When the Berlin Wall fell, architecture received more diverse currents and there was a boom in 5 star hotels with impressive glass and steel facades in the style of modern skyscrapers in Manhattan or other Latin American metropolises such as Mexico City or Caracas."

Writers such as Reinaldo Arenas, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, and Da\u221a\u2260na Chaviano, Pedro Juan Guti\u221a\u00a9rrez, Zo\u221a\u00a9 Vald\u221a\u00a9s, Guillermo Rosales and Leonardo Padura have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities. However, some Cuban writers continue living and writing in Cuba, including Nancy Morej\u221a\u2265n.[393]"

The central form of this music is son, which has been the basis of many other musical styles like \"Danz\u221a\u2265n de nuevo ritmo\", mambo, cha-cha-ch\u221a\u00b0 and salsa music. Rumba (\"de caj\u221a\u2265n o de solar\") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Spanish elements of style.[394] The Tres was invented in Cuba from Spanish cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute). Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, Ta\u221a\u2260no origin, or both, such as the maracas, g\u221a\u00bairo, mar\u221a\u2260mbula and various wooden drums including the mayohuac\u221a\u00b0n. Popular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like Ernesto Lecuona. Havana was the heart of the rap scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s. In December 2012, the director of the Cuban Music Institute, Orlando Vistel, threatened to bar sexually explicit songs and music videos from public radio and television.[395]"

There was a total of seven tropical storms, slightly below the contemporaneous 20-year average of 8.5\u00a0per season.[1] Three of those strengthened into hurricanes, while none reached major hurricane status \u2013 Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale \u2013 for the first time since 1940 and it was a phenomenon that would not occur again until 1968.[3] One hurricane made landfall in the United States, while the two other storms with winds of at least 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) remained at sea during their strongest intensities.[4] Overall in the United States, the season resulted in less than $10\u00a0million in damage and no deaths. Collectively, the storms of the season left at least $5.2\u00a0million in damage.[1] The final cyclone of the season dissipated on November\u00a03,[4] 12 days before the official end of the season on November\u00a015, 1946.[5] Tropical cyclogenesis began with the development of a tropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a013. The next system formed offshore the Southeastern United States on July\u00a05. Activity then ceased for nearly seven weeks, until August\u00a025, when the third storm originated in the Bay of Campeche. Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, there was only one tropical cyclone that strengthened to tropical storm status that month. The season's most intense storm developed on September\u00a012 and later peaked as a Category\u00a02 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and a lowest known barometric pressure of 975 millibars (28.8\u00a0inHg). Additionally, a tropical depression briefly existed near Central America. October was the most active month of the season, with three tropical cyclones. The third storm in October, which was the last system of the season, lasted until November\u00a03.[4] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 20, the lowest total since 1925 and until 1983.[3] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is tropical storm strength.[6]"

The storm made landfall just east of the Louisiana\u2013Texas border on June 16 and rapidly dissipated.[4] It may have remained a tropical depression throughout its lifespan but data was inconclusive. Winds of 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) were observed at Grand Isle, Louisiana, while winds of \"gentle to moderate force\" occurred in Texas.[7] In December 1946, H. C.

The cyclone moved northeastward and made landfall near Oak Island, North Carolina, around 08:00\u00a0UTC with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[4] In the state, Carolina Beach and Wrightsville Beach observed sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and gusts of 50\u201360\u00a0mph (80\u201397\u00a0km/h). In the Wilmington area, winds damaged plate-glass windows and caused brief disruptions to electricity and communication services. Further inland, heavy rainfall, including 7.84\u00a0in (199\u00a0mm) in less than 24\u00a0hours in Manteo, resulted in considerable loss to crops, with 15%-20% damaged in some areas. That was the heaviest 24-hour precipitation total recorded in Manteo since observations began in 1905.[7] The storm moved northeastward and reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean near the southern end of Bodie Island early on July\u00a07. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone began strengthening and became a Category\u00a01 hurricane by 12:00\u00a0UTC. After slightly further intensification, the hurricane reached peak intensity at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a07 with maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). It then curved eastward and began losing tropical characteristics. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a09, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about 390\u00a0mi (630\u00a0km) south-southeast of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia. The extratropical remnants gradually curved northeastward and then north-northeastward while slowly weakening. Late on July\u00a010, the extratropical storm dissipated near Cape Race, Newfoundland.[4]"

Late on September\u00a012, the cyclone strengthened into a hurricane before making landfall on South Abaco with winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). The hurricane intensified further after entering the open Atlantic, becoming on September\u00a013.

The storm accelerated and weakened due to cooler sea surface temperatures,[7] falling to tropical storm status early on September\u00a015. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone became extratropical about 170\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) south of Cape Sable Island. The extratropical remnants moved across Newfoundland and the northern Atlantic, until dissipating well north of the Azores on September\u00a017.[4] In the Bahamas, Hope Town observed sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and stronger gusts, as well as a barometric pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). The Norwegian tanker Maril II sank after splitting in two, drowning sixteen people. However, because the Maril II was over 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) away from the storm at the time, the incident could not be directly attributed to the hurricane.[1] Some areas of Nova Scotia experienced strong winds, with sustained winds up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) observed throughout the province and a gust of 71\u00a0mph (114\u00a0km/h) recorded at Sable Island. Heavy rain was also reported, with 2.9\u00a0in (74\u00a0mm) measured in Halifax. High seas during the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron race \"The Hood Cup\" forced the yachts to return to port.[8]"

About 2% of the state's total citrus crop was lost, with damage totaling $5\u00a0million. Only about $200,000 in property damage occurred, which was mostly due to coastal flooding in cities such as Everglades, Fort Myers, and Punta Gorda.[1] Moving inland, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm later on October\u00a08. Early on October\u00a09, the system became extratropical over South Carolina.

With the win, the Rams earned their third consecutive 2\u20130 start. Making his second career start at inside linebacker after missing all of 2019, Kiser forced a fumble on the Eagles' opening drive. Linebacker Kenny Young recovered the fumble by Eagles running back Miles Sanders to give Los Angeles possession at the Philadelphia 41. Three runs for 13 yards by rookie running back Cam Akers and a 24-yard pass from quarterback Jared Goff to wide receiver Cooper Kupp set up a 4-yard scoring toss from Goff to Higbee with 11:15 remaining in the first quarter. Goff, who completed his first 14 passes, led the Rams to scores on their next two drives, the first ending with a 5-yard run around end by Robert Woods and the second capped off by a second TD pass to Higbee from three yards out. After the Eagles bounced back with a pair of touchdowns in the second quarter, the Rams extended their lead as kicker Samuel Sloman added a 30-yard field goal in the third period. Then in the fourth, Goff and Higbee connected for a third touchdown, this one from 28 yards. Second-year running back Darryl Henderson led the Rams on the ground with 81 yards on 12 carries, including his first career NFL touchdown on a 2-yard run with 3:41 remaining in the game. Kiser led the Rams with 15 total tackles (10 solo) along with the forced fumble and a pass deflection. While Los Angeles did not sack Carson Wentz, constant pressure forced the Philadelphia quarterback to throw two interceptions to L.A. cornerbacks Darious Williams and Troy Hill as the Rams got their first-ever win at Lincoln Financial Field as well as their first road win over Philadelphia since the 2001 season."

Los Angeles had difficulty stopping Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen, who passed for three touchdowns and ran for another in building the Bills' 25-point lead midway through the third quarter. The Rams answered with an 8-play, 75-yard drive that ended with Jared Goff scoring from one yard out on a quarterback sneak. A questionable interception of Allen on the next drive by Rams safety John Johnson, who was credited with the pick after reaching for the ball as tight end Tyler Kroft caught it,[18] helped to set up a 25-yard touchdown pass from Goff to wide receiver Robert Woods, who was playing for the first time against the team that originally drafted him. Woods, who finished with five receptions for 74 yards, had a 31-yard catch that set up Goff's second touchdown pass of the day, this time to wide receiver Cooper Kupp with 10:40 remaining in the game. Goff connected with tight end Tyler Higbee for a successful two-point conversion to close to within 28\u201325. Running back Darrell Henderson had a strong game for the second straight week, rushing 20 times for 114 yards and gave the Rams their first and only lead of the game on a 1-yard run with 4:33 to play. The 25-point comeback was the best Rams rally since a 31\u201327 victory against Tampa Bay in 1992. The defense was led by defensive tackle Aaron Donald, who had two sacks among his six total tackles, including a forced fumble that he recovered to set up the Rams' go-ahead score. However, Allen was able to evade a furious Rams pass rush to make several late conversions and, after a likewise controversial pass interference call on fourth down against L.A. cornerback Darious Williams, connected with Tyler Kroft on a 3-yard scoring toss to reclaim the lead and ultimately the victory with just 15 seconds remaining.[19] Kupp led the Rams with six receptions for 107 yards while Goff, who completed 23 of 31 for 321 yards, surpassed 15,000 career passing yards (15,082).[20]"

Sam Sloman converted a 32-yard field goal to give L.A. a 10\u20133 lead. Though the Giants were able to control the ball and had a clear edge in time of possession (33:17 to 26:43), the Rams defense collected five sacks of New York quarterback Daniel Jones and limited the Giants to three Graham Gano field goals, the last coming less than a minute into the fourth quarter to pull New York to within 10\u20139. After the teams exchanged punts, the Rams came up with their biggest offensive play of the day as Goff found wide receiver Cooper Kupp over the middle. Kupp turned upfield and outraced Giants defenders to the end zone to complete the 55-yard touchdown pass play and extend the Rams' lead to 17\u20139 after Sloman's successful PAT. New York drove into Rams territory on its final two possessions but was turned away both times. With just under a minute remaining, Jones's pass attempt to wide receiver Damion Ratley was intercepted by Rams cornerback Darious Williams at the Los Angeles 7-yard-line to preserve the victory. Safety Taylor Rapp led the Rams with eight tackles, while cornerback Jalen Ramsey added four solo tackles, including a critical stop of Giants wide receiver Golden Tate for a 1-yard loss on a third-and-3 play near midfield, which was soon followed by the Rams' final touchdown. Following the game, Ramsey and Tate got into a fight that would lead to disciplinary action by the NFL. The Rams, who improved to 2\u20130 on the season at SoFi Stadium, also debuted their Royal-and-Sol jersey-and-pants combination, which had been spurred by fan demand."

Rams head coach Sean McVay earned his first victory over Washington in what was his first return to FedExField since taking L.A.'s head coaching job four years earlier. McVay previously served as an assistant coach for the then-Washington Redskins from 2010 to 2016 under head coaches Mike Shanahan and Jay Gruden. In 2017, the then-Redskins had dealt McVay his first loss as a head coach. For the third time in McVay's head coaching tenure, the Rams completed a season sweep of another NFL division, having swept opponents from the AFC South in 2017 and the AFC West in 2018 (Los Angeles also won all six games versus NFC West opponents in 2018). The victory also spoiled the return of Washington quarterback Alex Smith, who entered the game in the second quarter to play in an NFL game for the first time since suffering a catastrophic leg injury two years earlier."

The Rams' triumph ended a 10-game postseason home win streak for Seattle at dating back to 2004, when the then-St. Louis Rams defeated the Seahawks 27-20 in an NFC Wild Card Game at Lumen Field, then known as Qwest Field. After an exchange of opening-drive punts, Los Angeles pushed into Seattle territory as Akers ran five times for 35 yards. Starting for the second straight week, quarterback John Wolford completed passes of 15 and 13 yards to wide receiver Cooper Kupp, but was then knocked out of the game after colliding with Seattle safety Jamal Adams on a scramble down to the Seahawks 18. The drive ended in a 40-yard field goal by kicker Matt Gay. After Seattle tied the game early in the second quarter, Rams quarterback Jared Goff (still nursing a broken thumb suffered during the teams' previous meeting two weeks earlier) misfired on his first four pass attempts before connecting with Kupp on a 44-yard pass play that led to a 39-yard field goal by Gay.

Seattle was able to answer with a long touchdown pass from Wilson to wide receiver DK Metcalf on a broken play, but the Rams countered with a 75-yard scoring drive. Akers took a dump-off pass from Goff and turned it into a 44-yard gain, then ran for 20 yards on his next carry that would ultimately set up his own score on a 5-yard run and a 20-10 halftime lead for L.A. In the fourth quarter, Gay would add his third field goal of the day from 36 yards and after Micah Kiser recovered a fumble on a Seahawks punt return, Goff found wide receiver Robert Woods wide open for a 15-yard TD pass to give the Rams a 30-13 advantage.

        "content": " The United Kingdom straddles the higher mid-latitudes between 49\u00b0 and 61\u00b0N on the western seaboard of Europe. Since the UK is always in or close to the path of the polar front jet stream, frequent changes in pressure and unsettled weather are typical. Many types of weather can be experienced in a single day. The climate in the United Kingdom is defined as a humid temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, a classification it shares with most of north-west Europe.[1] Regional climates are influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and latitude. Northern Ireland, Wales and western parts of England and Scotland, being closest to the Atlantic Ocean, are generally the mildest, wettest, and windiest regions of the UK, and temperature ranges there are seldom extreme. Eastern areas are drier, cooler, and less windy, and also experience the greatest daily and seasonal temperature variations. Northern areas are generally cooler and wetter and have slightly larger temperature ranges than southern areas, which are generally warmer and drier. The UK is mostly under the influence of the maritime polar air mass from the north-west. Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland are the most exposed to the maritime polar air mass which brings cool moist air; the east of Scotland and north-east England are more exposed to the continental polar air mass which brings cold dry air. The south and south-east of England are the least exposed to polar air masses from the north-west, and on occasion see continental tropical air masses from the south, which bring warm dry air in the summer. On average, the temperature ranges from 18 to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (64 to 77\u00a0\u00b0F). If the air masses are strong enough in their respective areas during the summer, there can sometimes be a large difference in temperature between the far north of Scotland (including its islands) and the south-east of England \u2013 often a difference of 10\u201315\u00a0\u00b0C (18\u201327\u00a0\u00b0F) but sometimes as much as 20\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F) or more. In the height of summer the Northern Isles can have temperatures around 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F).[2]"

England is also sunnier throughout the year, but unlike Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the sunniest month is July, with an average of 193.5 hours. It rains on fewer days every month throughout the year than the rest of the UK, and rainfall totals are less in every month, with the driest month, May, averaging 58.4\u00a0mm (2.30\u00a0in).[3] The climate of south-west England displays a seasonal temperature variation, although it is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom with milder winters. Certain species of palm trees and other exotic plants can be grown in coastal areas of Southwest England although summers are cooler than the Southeast. Gales are less common in England compared to Scotland; however, on some occasions, there can be strong winds, and rarely, the remains of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms. Some events such as the Great Storm of 1987 occurred near the UK and caused damage in England.\nTemperate summer heatwaves of 30\u00a0\u00b0C+ and droughts occasionally occur, especially in London and Southeast England. The summer of 2018 was particularly sunny and dry across England.\nThe prevailing wind direction for England is from the south-west. London is vulnerable to climate change in the United Kingdom, and there is increasing concern among hydrological experts that London households may run out of water before 2050.[4] "

        "content": "Wales has warmer temperatures throughout the year than Northern Ireland and Scotland and has milder winter minima than England, but cooler winter maxima than Northern Ireland. Wales is wetter throughout the year than Northern Ireland and England, but has fewer rainy days than Northern Ireland; meaning that rainfall tends to be more intense. Wales is also drier than Scotland in every month apart from May, June and December, and there are fewer days with rain than in Scotland. Sunshine totals throughout the year are more than that of Scotland and Northern Ireland, but less than that of neighbouring England. May is the sunniest month, averaging 186.8 hours.[27] The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby, Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January and the sunniest between May and August. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually.[28][29] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually.[28] Wales experiences long summer days and short winter days result of northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth, at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours.[30] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F).[28] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift, a branch of the Gulf Stream. The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds.[31] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, rainfall is excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature.[32] Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40 per cent more.[29] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer.[32] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) (Blaenau Ffestiniog) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) (Snowdon's summit).[29] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in).[28][29] Below is a list of record temperatures for Wales, according to the UK Met Office.[2]"

As the sun rises higher in the sky and the days get longer, temperatures slowly rise, but the solar effect is mitigated somewhat by the effect of the cool ocean waters and westerly winds that blow across them. There is a chance of snow earlier in the season when temperatures are colder; often in March. Mean temperatures in Spring are markedly influenced by latitude. Most of Scotland and the mountains of Wales and northern England are the coolest areas of the UK, with average temperatures ranging from \u22120.6 to 5.8\u00a0\u00b0C (30.9 to 42.4\u00a0\u00b0F).[34] The southern half of England experiences the warmest spring temperatures of between 8.8 and 10.3\u00a0\u00b0C (47.8 and 50.5\u00a0\u00b0F).[34] Spring mean temperatures have become higher during the 2000s and the 2010s.

        "header": "Autumn",
        "content": "Autumn in the United Kingdom lasts from September to November.[39] The season may be a little more unsettled; as cool polar air moves southwards, it can meet warm air from the tropics and produce an area of disturbance along which the country lies. This can combine with the warm ocean due to heating throughout the spring and summer, to produce some unsettled weather. In addition, the land may become colder than the ocean, resulting in significant amounts of condensation and rain-bearing clouds. Atlantic depressions at this time can become intense, and winds of hurricane force (greater than 119\u00a0km/h or 74\u00a0mph) can be recorded. Western areas, closest to the Atlantic, experience these severe conditions more often than eastern areas. Autumn, particularly the latter part, is often the stormiest time of the year. One particularly intense depression was the Great Storm of 1987. A very severe storm also affected the UK on 27 October 2002. At Mumbles Head near Swansea, a maximum sustained wind speed of over 123\u00a0km/h was recorded: equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane.[40] The autumn of 2013 was also littered with severe storms, including the St. Jude's Storm on 28 October 2013. Autumn can sometimes be a cold season\u2014in recent years, very low temperatures and heavy snowfall have been recorded during November 1985, November 1993 and November 2010. There was a new record low of \u221218.0\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22120.4\u00a0\u00b0F) in Wales on 28 November 2010. At Northolt, in Greater London, the coldest temperature of the year 2016 was set on 30 November. Snow also fell rather widely across the UK on 28\u201329 October 2008, causing traffic problems where it settled on the M4. Even further south, low temperatures can be recorded, with temperatures well below freezing as far south as Heathrow Airport on 29\u201331 October 1997, with a lower temperature than any recorded at this station in March, However, the United Kingdom sometimes experiences an \"Indian summer\", when temperatures, particularly by night, can be very mild and rarely fall below 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F). Such events are aided by the surrounding Atlantic Ocean and seas being at their warmest, keeping the country in warm air, despite the relatively weak sun. Examples of this were in 1985, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2011[41] and 2016 when September saw above average temperatures which felt more like a continuation of summer than autumn. Autumns since 2000 have generally been very mild, with notable extremes of precipitation; the UK has seen some of its wettest and driest autumns since the millennium. 2011 and 2016 were notable as many areas of the country recorded their highest temperatures of the year in September and October (for example, 28.2\u00a0\u00b0C (82.8\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden on 1 October, 26.3\u00a0\u00b0C (79.3\u00a0\u00b0F) at St. Athan on 2 October 2011 and the UK's highest temperature of 2016 on 13 September with 34.4\u00a0\u00b0C (93.9\u00a0\u00b0F) at Gravesend).[42] On 13 October 2018, temperatures reached 26.5\u00a0\u00b0C (79.7\u00a0\u00b0F) at Donna Nook in Lincolnshire, the latest in the year such a high temperature had been recorded.[43] Temperatures on the night of 12\u201313 October were also just under 18.2\u00a0\u00b0C (64.8\u00a0\u00b0F) in London. Coastal areas in the southern half of England have on average the warmest autumns, with mean temperatures of 10.7 to 13.0\u00a0\u00b0C (51.3 to 55.4\u00a0\u00b0F).[44] Mountainous areas of Wales and northern England, and almost all of Scotland, experience mean temperatures between 1.7 and 7.5\u00a0\u00b0C (35.1 and 45.5\u00a0\u00b0F).[44] The warmest autumn on record was in 2006 with a mean temperature of 11.35C. The coldest autumn on record was in 1887 with a mean temperature of 6.97C. The sunniest autumn on record for the UK was 1959 with an average of 341.3 sunshine hours recorded on average across the UK. The dullest autumn on record for the UK was in 1968 with just 208.2 hours of sunshine recorded. The wettest autumn on record for the UK was in 2000 with an average of 509.6mm of precipitation across the UK.  The driest autumn on record for the UK was in 1922 with 192.7mm of precipitation.[37]"

        "header": "Winter",
        "content": "Winter in the UK is defined as lasting from December to February. The season is generally cool, wet, windy, and cloudy. Temperatures at night rarely drop below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C (14\u00a0\u00b0F) and in the day rarely rise above 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F). Precipitation can be plentiful throughout the season, though snow is relatively infrequent despite the country's high latitude: often the only areas with significant snowfall are the Scottish Highlands and the Pennines, where at higher elevations a colder climate determines the vegetation, mainly temperate coniferous forest, although deforestation has severely decreased the forest area. For a majority of the UK, snow is frequent in winter time yet is usually light and does not last long, apart from the higher altitudes, where snow can lie for 1\u20135 months or even beyond 6 months.[45] Towards the later part of the season the weather usually stabilises with less wind, less precipitation and lower temperatures. This change is particularly pronounced near the coasts, mainly because the Atlantic Ocean is often at its coldest at this time after being cooled throughout the autumn and the winter. The early part of winter however is often unsettled and stormy; often the wettest and windiest time of the year. Snow falls intermittently and mainly affects northern and eastern areas, high ground in Wales and especially the mountains of Scotland, where there is often enough snow lying to permit skiing at some of the five Scottish ski resorts. These resorts usually operate between December and April, depending on the snowfall. Frequently in the mountains potent depressions may move in from the north in the form of \"polar lows\", introducing heavy snow and often blizzard-like conditions to parts of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland. Blizzards have become rarer in the 21st century, although much of England was affected by one on 30 January 2003. During periods of light winds and high pressure, frost and fog can become a problem and can pose a major hazard to drivers. Mean winter temperatures in the UK are most influenced by proximity to the sea. The coldest areas are the mountains of Wales and northern England, and inland areas of Scotland, averaging \u22123.6 to 2.3\u00a0\u00b0C (25.5 to 36.1\u00a0\u00b0F).[46] Coastal areas, particularly those in the south and west, experience the mildest winters, on average 5 to 8.7\u00a0\u00b0C (41.0 to 47.7\u00a0\u00b0F).[46] Hardiness zones in the UK are high, ranging from zone 7 in the Scottish Highlands, the Pennines and Snowdonia, to zone 10 on the Isles of Scilly. Most of the UK lies in zones 8 or 9.[47] In zone 7, the average lowest temperature each year is between \u221217.7 and \u221212.3\u00a0\u00b0C (0.1 and 9.9\u00a0\u00b0F), and in zone 10, this figure is between \u22121.1 and 4.4\u00a0\u00b0C (30.0 and 39.9\u00a0\u00b0F).[48] Snow falls in the UK every year, but in small quantities. The UK can suffer extreme winters like 1684, 1740, 1795 (when London had its record lowest temperature of \u221221.1\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22126.0\u00a0\u00b0F), 1947 and 1963. In 1962 it snowed on Boxing Day, and snow lasted in most areas until 6 March, with blizzards through February, which had significant and documented effects on the FA Cup - Wrexham were forced to play on sand for one tie. In recent times snow has generally become rarer, but the UK can still get heavy falls, such as in 1978\u201379, 1981\u201382, 1986\u201387 and 1990\u201391. The winter of 2008/09 produced the heaviest snowfall since 1991 between 1 and 3 February, and the winter of 2009\u201310 was even more severe, with many parts of the United Kingdom having the coldest and snowiest winters since 1978/79; temperatures plummeted to \u221222.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22128.1\u00a0\u00b0F) at Altnaharra, Sutherland \u2013 close to the \u221222.9\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22129.2\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded in Antarctica in the same period. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK was \u221227.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221217.0\u00a0\u00b0F), on 10 January 1982 and 11 February 1895 in Braemar, Scotland and on 30 December 1995 in Altnaharra. December 2015 was the wettest calendar month ever recorded in the United Kingdom, and January 2016 the second wettest. In these months, some northern and western parts had 2 to 4 times as much rainfall as normal.[49] December 2015 was also the warmest December averaged over the whole UK, and the CET had the warmest December on record. (CET was 9.7\u00a0\u00b0C (49.5\u00a0\u00b0F), this is warmer than even any March[50]). Most areas of southern England had average monthly temperatures 5\u20136 deg. C above normal. Some plants flowered that would normally do so in the spring.[51] The mildest winter on record for England was the winter of 2015\u201316 with a mean temperature for England of 6.47C.

The lowest sunshine hours are found in northern parts of the country and the highest in the southern parts and southern coast of England. The counties of Dorset, Hampshire, Sussex and Kent are the sunniest areas, which have annual average totals of around 1,750 hours of sunshine per year.[54] Northern, western and mountainous areas are generally the cloudiest areas of the UK, with some mountainous areas receiving fewer than 1,000 hours of sunshine a year.[54] Valley areas such as the South Wales Valleys, due to their north\u2013south orientation, receive less sunshine than lowland areas because the mountains on either side of the valley obscure the sun in the early morning and late evening. This is noticeable in winter where there are only a few hours of sunshine. The mountains of Wales, northern England and Scotland can be especially cloudy with extensive mist and fog. Near the coast, sea fog may develop in the spring and early summer. Radiation fog may develop over inland areas of Great Britain and can persist for hours or even days in the winter and can pose a major hazard for drivers and aircraft. Often anticyclones (high pressure systems) may move over the United Kingdom, which can persist for weeks or even months. The subsided, dry air from the Azores often results in clear skies and few clouds, bringing frosty nights in winter and warm days in the summer. Average hours of sunshine in winter range from 38\u2013108 hours in some mountainous areas and western Scotland, up to 217 hours in the south and east of England;[55] while average hours of sunshine in summer range from 294\u2013420 hours in northern Scotland and Northern Ireland, to 600\u2013760 hours in southern English coastal counties.[56]\nThe most sunshine recorded in one month was 383.9 hours at Eastbourne (East Sussex) in July 1911.[54]"

This thermohaline circulation has a powerful moderating and warming effect on the country's climate. This warm water current warms the climate to such a great extent that if the current did not exist then temperatures in winter would be about 10\u00a0\u00b0C (18\u00a0\u00b0F) lower than they are today and similar to eastern Russia or Canada near the same latitude. The current allows England to have vineyards at the same latitude that Canada has polar bears.

Gales\u2014which are defined as winds with speeds of 51 to 101\u00a0km/h (32 to 63\u00a0mph)\u2014are strongly associated with the passage of deep depressions across the country. The Hebrides experience on average 35 days of gale a year (a day where there are gale-force winds) while inland areas in England and Wales receive fewer than 5 days of gale a year.[54] Areas of high elevation tend to have higher wind speeds than low elevations, and Great Dun Fell in Cumbria (at 857\u00a0m or 2,812\u00a0ft) averaged 114 days of gale a year during the period 1963 to 1976. The highest gust recorded at a low level in England was 191\u00a0km/h (119\u00a0mph) at Gwennap Head in Cornwall on 15 December 1979,[54] and a 115\u00a0mph gust was also recorded at Shoreham-By-Sea on 16 October 1987. A disputed 122\u00a0mph gust was recorded on 16 October 1987 at Gorleston in Norfolk during the Great Storm of 1987. In Scotland, Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire recorded 229\u00a0km/h (142\u00a0mph) on 13 February 1989, which was equalled during Cyclone Xaver on 5 December 2013. Wales' highest wind speed gust of 200\u00a0km/h (124\u00a0mph) was set at Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan on 28 October 1989. Especially potent storm systems typically affect the UK during autumn and winter, with the winters of 1989/1990 and 2013/2014 particularly notable for the frequency and potency of storm systems. An unofficial gust of 194\u00a0mph (312\u00a0km/h) was recorded in the Shetland Isles during the New Year's Day Storm on 1 January 1992, and an equal unofficial 194\u00a0mph wind gust is claimed to have been set in the Cairngorm Mountains on 19 December 2008.[58] Barometric pressure plays a role in storm systems.

        "content": "Rainfall amounts can vary greatly across the United Kingdom: generally the further west and the higher the elevation, the greater the rainfall. The mountains of Wales, Scotland, the Pennines in Northern England and the moors of South West England are the wettest parts of the country, and in some of these places as much as 4,577 millimetres (180.2\u00a0in) of rain can fall annually,[60] making these locations some of the wettest in Europe. The wettest spot in the United Kingdom is Crib Goch, in Snowdonia, which averaged 178 inches (4,500\u00a0mm) rain over a 30 year period.[61][62] Most rainfall in the United Kingdom comes from North Atlantic depressions which roll into the country throughout the year from the west or southwest and are particularly frequent and intense in the autumn and winter. They can on occasions bring prolonged periods of heavy rain, and flooding is quite common. Parts of England are dry in global terms, which is contrary to the stereotypical view\u2014London receives just below 650 millimetres (25.6\u00a0in) per annum,[63] which is less than Rome, Sydney, or New York City. In East Anglia it typically rains on about 113 days per year.[64] Most of the south, south-east and East Anglia receive less than 700 millimetres (27.6\u00a0in) of rain per year.[54] The English counties of Essex, Cambridgeshire\u2014as well as parts of North Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire, Suffolk and Norfolk\u2014are amongst the driest in the UK, with an average annual rainfall of around 600 millimetres (23.6\u00a0in). This is due to a mild rainshadow effect, due to mountainous parts of the South West, Wales and Cumbria blocking the moist airflow across the country to the east. In some years rainfall totals in Essex and South Suffolk can be below 450 millimetres (17.7\u00a0in) (especially areas around Colchester, Clacton and Ipswich)\u2014less than the average annual rainfall in Jerusalem, Beirut and even some semi-arid parts of the world. The rainy reputation of Britain originates from the frequent cool, cloudy and drizzly conditions rather than overall rainfall amounts. Parts of the United Kingdom have had drought problems in recent years, particularly in 2004\u20132006 and more recently in 2018. Fires broke out in some areas, even across the normally damp higher ground of north-west England and Wales. The landscape in much of England and east Wales became very parched, even near the coast; water restrictions were in place in some areas. July 2006 was the hottest month on record for the United Kingdom and much of Europe,[65] however England has had warmer spells of 31 days which did not coincide with a calendar month\u2014in 1976 and 1995. The impact of droughts is increased because the driest parts of England also have the highest population density, and therefore the highest water consumption. The drought in 2006 was eased when in the period from October 2006 to January 2007, which had well above average rainfall. December 2015 was the wettest month ever recorded in the United Kingdom.[66] The average rainfall for the month was almost doubled.[67]"

        "content": "Generally, the United Kingdom has cool to mild winters and warm to hot summers with moderate variation in temperature throughout the year. In England the average annual temperature varies from 8.5\u00a0\u00b0C (47.3\u00a0\u00b0F) in the north to 11\u00a0\u00b0C (51.8\u00a0\u00b0F) in the south, but over the higher ground this can be several degrees lower.[54] This small variation in temperature is to a large extent due to the moderating effect the Atlantic Ocean has\u2014water has a much greater specific heat capacity than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The ocean is at its coldest in February or early March, thus around coastal areas February is often the coldest month, but inland there is little to choose between January and February as the coldest.[54] Temperatures tend to drop lowest on late winter nights inland, in the presence of high pressure, clear skies, light winds and when there is snow on the ground. On occasions, cold polar or continental air can be drawn in over the United Kingdom to bring very cold weather. The floors of inland valleys away from warming influence of the sea can be particularly cold as cold, dense air drains into them. A temperature of \u221226.1\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221215.0\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded under such conditions at Edgmond in Shropshire on 10 January 1982, the coldest temperature recorded in England and Wales. The following day the coldest maximum temperature in England, at \u221211.3\u00a0\u00b0C (11.7\u00a0\u00b0F), was recorded at the same site.[54] On average the warmest winter temperatures occur on the south and west coasts, however, warm temperatures occasionally occur due to a foehn wind warming up downwind after crossing the mountains. Temperatures in these areas can rise to 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter on rare occasions[69] This is a particularly notable event in northern Scotland, mainly Aberdeenshire, where these high temperatures can occur in midwinter when the sun only reaches about 10\u00b0 above the horizon. July is on average the warmest month, and the highest temperatures tend to occur away from the Atlantic in southern, eastern and central England, where summer temperatures can rise above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).[70]"

        "header": "Severe weather",
        "content": "The United Kingdom is not particularly noted for extreme weather, as the region's cool, oceanic climate is opposed to convective storms. However, events such as floods and drought may be experienced. The summer of 1976 or 2018, for example, experienced temperatures as high as 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F), and it was so dry the country suffered drought and water shortages.[71] Extended periods of extreme weather, such as the droughts of 1975\u20131976, summer 2006, and spring 2012, the long hot summers of 1911, 1976, 2003, 2006 and 2018, and the winters of 1946\u20131947, 1962\u20131963, 2009\u20132010, and 2010\u20132011 are often caused by blocking anticyclones which can persist for several days, weeks, or even months. In winter they can bring long periods of cold dry weather and in summer long periods of hot dry weather. There have also been occurrences of severe flash floods caused by intense rainfall; the most severe was the Lynmouth disaster of 1952 in which 34 people died and 38 houses and buildings were completely destroyed. In the summer of 2004, a severe flash flood devastated the town of Boscastle in Cornwall. However, the worst floods in the United Kingdom in modern times occurred in the North Sea flood of 1953. A powerful storm from the Atlantic moved around Scotland and down the east coast of England. As it moved south it produced a storm surge which was magnified as the North Sea became narrower further south. By the time the storm affected south-east England and the Netherlands, the surge had reached the height of 3.6 metres (12\u00a0ft). Over 300 people were killed by the floods in eastern England. Thunderstorms in general are not common in the U.K. The areas that see the most occur in the southern part of England, while areas in the north and west see very few thunderstorms annually.[72] In London, thunderstorms occur on average 14\u201319 days a year, while in most of Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland thunderstorms occur on around 3 days a year. The counties that see the most storms are Kent, the eastern part of Surrey, Sussex, Greater London, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and to a lesser extent Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire.[72] Occasionally, thunderstorms can be severe and produce large hailstones as seen in Ottery St Mary, Devon in October 2008, where drifts reached 1.8 metres (5\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in).[73] Strong winds occur mainly in the autumn and winter months associated with low pressure systems and Scotland experiences hurricane-force winds in most winters. The Gale of January 1976, Great Storm of 1987 (23\u00a0fatalities) and the Burns' Day storm of 1990 (97\u00a0fatalities) are particularly severe examples; Scotland saw winds of 142\u00a0mph during Cyclone Xaver in 2013.[74] The most rain recorded to fall on a single day was 279\u00a0mm at Martinstown (Dorset) on 18 July 1955,[54] but also 243\u00a0mm fell at Bruton, Somerset on 28 June 1917.[75] Heavy rain also fell between 20 and 25 June in 2007; some areas experienced a month's rainfall in one day. Four people died in the flooding and over \u00a31.5\u00a0billion of damage to businesses and properties was caused. Tropical cyclones do not affect the UK due to the high latitude, cold ocean waters, and distance from source regions of tropical storms.[76] so any tropical cyclone that does come anywhere near the UK has said to have undergone a process called extratropical transition. This now means it is an extratropical cyclone, which the UK frequently experiences. The Great Storm of 1987 was a very deep depression which formed in the Bay of Biscay, which also contained the remnants of Hurricane Floyd.[77] Hurricane Lili of 1996 and Hurricane Gordon of 2006 both crossed the UK as strong extratropical cyclones with tropical hurricane-force winds, causing transport closures, power-cuts and flooding in Northern Ireland, Scotland and South West England. In 2011, the remnants of Hurricane Katia passed over northwestern Scotland with winds near 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h)."

Dr. Ted Fujita (inventor of the Fujita scale), an American meteorologist, was the first to recognise the UK as the top site for tornadoes in 1973.[80][81] Although most tornadoes are weak, there are occasional destructive events, for example, the 2005 Birmingham tornado and the 2006 London tornado. Both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury. The largest ever recorded was thought to have been an F4, again in London in 1091. The most deadly occurred on 28 December 1879. All 74 people died when a passenger train plunged from the Tay Bridge (Tayside) into the Tay Estuary, when the middle section of the bridge collapsed. Although the bridge was poorly constructed and had already been weakened in earlier gales (including the pre-existing winds at the time of the tragedy), the ultimate failure is believed to have been caused by two or three waterspouts which were sighted close to the bridge immediately before the accident.[82] The UK also holds the title for the largest known tornado outbreak outside of the United States. On 23 November 1981, 105 tornadoes were spawned by a cold front in the space of 5.25 hours. Excepting Derbyshire, every county in a triangular area from Gwynedd to Humberside to Essex was hit by at least one tornado, while Norfolk was hit by at least 13. Very fortunately most tornadoes were short-lived and also weak (the strongest was around T5 on the TORRO Tornado Scale) and no deaths occurred.[82] Southern England between the Isle of Wight and Beachy Head has been recognised as a 'hotspot' for tornadoes and waterspouts.[83] The area (known as 'The Isle of Wight and South Coast Anomaly') has seen significant activity and is thought to be due to the shedding of vortices, downwind of the Isle of Wight, under certain weather conditions.[83]"

        "content": "The climate of the United Kingdom has not always been the way it is today. During some periods it was much warmer and in others it was much colder. The last glacial period was a period of extreme cold weather that lasted for tens of thousands of years and ended about 10,000 years ago. During this period the temperature was so low that much of the surrounding ocean froze and a great ice sheet extended over all of the United Kingdom except the south of England (connected to mainland Europe via the dry English Channel) and southern coastal areas of Wales. The cold period from the 16th to the mid-19th centuries is known as the Little Ice Age. The temperature records in England are continuous back to the mid 17th century. The Central England temperature (CET) record is the oldest in the world, and is a compound source of cross-correlated records from several locations in central England. Precipitation records date back to the eighteenth century and the modern England and Wales Precipitation series begins in 1766. A detailed narrative account of the weather of every year from 1913 to 1942, with photographs of plants taken on the same day in each of those years, may be found in Willis (1944).[84] As with many parts of the world, over the last century the United Kingdom has reported a warming trend in temperatures. While some of this may be due to a recovery from the cooler period of climate mid 20th century (particularly the 1960s) the last 20 years has nonetheless seen an unprecedented level of warm weather. In July 2019, BBC reported that records from the Met Office show that the 10 warmest years in the UK have occurred since 2002, with 2014 being the warmest. In the same period, the coolest year has been 2010; however, this still only ranks 22nd on the overall list of coolest years on record.[85] In January 2024, provisional data released by the Met Office report that 2023 was the second hottest year on record, surpassing 2014. This puts it just behind 2022, which recorded an average temperature of only 0.06\u00a0\u00b0C (32.11\u00a0\u00b0F) higher. However, for both Wales and Northern Ireland, 2023 was their hottest year on record.[86] The averages shown below have been calculated using month CET data from 1659, using periods of 30 years as the WMO advises.[87]"

        "content": " The 1913 Atlantic hurricane season was the third consecutive year with a tropical cyclone developing before June. The first system, a tropical depression, developed on May\u00a05 while the last transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a030. Of note, the seventh and eighth cyclones existed simultaneously from August\u00a030 to September\u00a04. Of the season's ten tropical cyclones, six became tropical storms and four strengthened into hurricanes. Furthermore, none of these strengthened into a major hurricane\u2014Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale\u2014marking the sixth such occurrence since 1900.[1] The strongest hurricane of the season peaked as only a Category\u00a01 with winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). That system left five deaths and at least $4\u00a0million in damage in North Carolina. The first hurricane of the season also caused one fatality in Texas, while damage in South Carolina from the fifth hurricane reached at least $75,000. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 36,[1] below the 1911\u20131920 average of 58.7.[2] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

Early on June\u00a023, the storm made landfall near the Honduras\u2013Nicaragua border with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). Thereafter, it continued north-northwestward and oscillated slightly in strength. The system made another landfall near Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo, with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) late on June\u00a025. After briefly crossing the Yucatan Peninsula, the cyclone emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and eventually began moving more to the west-northwest. Early on June\u00a027, it deepened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). The hurricane then curved northwestward and made landfall in Padre Island, Texas, at the same intensity around 01:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a028. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened and dissipated over Val Verde County just under 24\u00a0hours later.[4] Impact in Central America and Mexico is unknown. The storm brought heavy rainfall to portions of South Texas. At Montell, 20.6\u00a0in (520\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell in about 19\u00a0hours, while Uvalde observed 8.5\u00a0in (220\u00a0mm) of rain in approximately 17\u00a0hours. The resultant flooding caused considerable damage to lowlands, houses, and stock. Additionally, communication by telegraph and telephone were cut-off for several days and traffic was interrupted due to inundated streets. One person drowned in Montell. Strong winds were also reported, with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) over Central Padre Island. Along the coast, storm surge peaked at 12.7\u00a0ft (3.9\u00a0m) in Galveston.[3]"

Hours later, it made landfall near Cape Lookout at the same intensity. Shortly after moving inland, the system weakened to a tropical storm. By September\u00a04, it deteriorated to a tropical depression before dissipating over northeastern Georgia.[4] In North Carolina, winds as high as 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) at Hatteras caused severe crop losses, especially in areas adjacent to Pamlico Sound. The worst of the property damage occurred in the vicinity of New Bern and Washington. At the latter, northeast to southeast gales caused waterways to rise 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) above previous high-water marks. Large railroad bridges in both New Bern and Washington were washed away, as were many other small bridges. Many low-lying streets were inundated.[3] The storm was considered \"the worst in history\" at Goldsboro.[5] In Farmville, a warehouse collapsed, killing two people inside while three deaths occurred elsewhere in the state.[6] Throughout North Carolina, numerous telegraph and telephone lines were damaged. Similarly, telegraph and telephone lined were downed in rural areas of Virginia. Small houses in Newport News, Ocean View, and Old Point were unroofed.

        "content": " Tropical Storm Kirk was the second lowest-latitude tropical storm on record in the Atlantic basin. The eleventh named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Kirk originated from a tropical wave that left Africa on September\u00a020 and organized into a tropical depression two days later. The system intensified into Tropical Storm Kirk early on September\u00a022 but quickly degenerated into a tropical wave again early the next day. A reduction in the disturbance's forward speed allowed it to regain tropical storm intensity on September\u00a026. Kirk reached maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) that morning before increasing westerly wind shear caused the cyclone to steadily weaken. The storm made landfall on Saint Lucia with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) before continuing into the Caribbean Sea. Kirk degenerated to a tropical wave again on September\u00a028, and its remnants continued westward, contributing to the formation of Hurricane Michael ten days later. Kirk passed narrowly north of Barbados, where tropical storm-force winds cut power to multiple neighborhoods and caused property damage at the official residence of the Governor-General. Rainfall in excess of 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) flooded structures and vehicles, prompting 11 emergency water rescues. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, rough seas caused coastal flooding and led to the presumed deaths of two fishermen after they ventured out during the storm. On Saint Lucia, strong winds destroyed two buildings; additional structures, including schools and the anemometer at the Hewanorra International Airport, sustained damage. About 2,000 chickens on a poultry farm were killed following the collapse of their pens, and about 80\u201390% of the island's banana crop was left in ruin. The combination of winds and landslides prompted widespread power outages. Lesser impacts were felt on Martinique, where winds damaged trees and cut power to about 3,000 homes."

        "content": "A low-latitude tropical wave departed the western coast of Africa late on September\u00a020 and moved rapidly west-northwest. After two days of sporadic convective development, it acquired sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a022 to the south of Cabo Verde. Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kirk at 8.1\u00b0N, representing the second lowest-latitude tropical storm on record in the Atlantic; only the third storm of the 1902 hurricane season formed farther south. A subtropical ridge to the north of the newly formed cyclone expanded westward, directing the system in the same direction. Kirk became less organized over the next day as a large band of convection, similar to an outflow boundary, propagated away from the center into the northwestern quadrant. This cloud pattern suggested the entrainment of mid-level dry air. The hostile environment caused Kirk to degenerate into a tropical wave by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023.[1] Even after degeneration, the storm's remnants continued to produce a large area of showers and thunderstorms, along with gale-force winds in the northern quadrant.[2] By September\u00a026, the forward motion of the remnants slowed, allowing convection to coalesce about a new well-defined center. The NHC accordingly re-initiated Kirk as a tropical storm around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026 about 520\u00a0miles (835\u00a0km) east-southeast of Barbados. By the morning hours, Kirk's presentation had evolved to feature a strong central dense overcast with few banding features.[3] Satellite intensity estimates were used to assign a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) at 12:00\u00a0UTC through 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026. Thereafter, the cyclone's presentation morphed into a comma-shaped appearance, with the center at times partially exposed on the western edge of this convection due to increasing westerly wind shear.[4] Kirk temporarily moved west-northwest, passing just north of Barbados, before banking west-southwest under the dominant steering regime of a ridge in the western Atlantic. It struck Saint Lucia as a 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) tropical storm around 00:30\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030 and entered the Caribbean, where the storm resumed a west-northwest course while continuing to lose strength. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029, after a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to locate a well-defined and closed center, the NHC downgraded Kirk to a tropical wave again while it was positioned a few hundred miles south of the United States Virgin Islands.[1] The remnants continued into the western Caribbean, where they were absorbed by a large area of disturbed weather by October\u00a02 and contributed to the formation of Hurricane Michael.[5]"

The strong winds also destroyed an anemometer at Hewanorra International Airport.[30] Following the storm, the Saint Lucia Red Cross provided blankets, tarpaulins, and other emergence supplies to households impacted by Kirk.[31] Agricultural interests took a hard hit, particularly in northern parts of the island;[11] many banana fields were ravaged, leading to an 80\u201390% loss of that crop on the island.[30][32] In Babonneau, some 2,000 chickens on a poultry farm were killed when their pens collapsed.[33] In some cases, farmers were not covered under their insurance plans because Kirk fell just below intensity thresholds stipulated for tropical cyclone compensation.[34] Taiwan's International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) contributed EC$1.4 million (US$518,000) in relief funds to be distributed among 108 farmers on Saint Lucia.[34] This donation marked the beginning of the Banana Productivity Improvement Project, a joint program between the ICDF and the Saint Lucia government to support and educate farmers.[35] For instance, it was observed that banana farms shielded by windbreaks fared much better during Tropical Storm Kirk than exposed fields, so with additional ICDF funding, thousands of mango trees were planted as barriers against future wind storms, and growers were counseled on how to care for the trees.[36] Gusty winds extended northward to Martinique; weather stations at standard 33-foot (10\u00a0m) elevation recorded sustained winds of 41\u00a0mph (66\u00a0km/h), gusting to 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h). One station at higher elevation observed a peak gust to 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h).[1] The winds damaged trees and cut power to 3,000 homes, mostly in Le Robert, Sainte-Marie, Gros-Morne, and Le Morne-Vert communes, and the capital city of Fort-de-France.[37] In Saint-Esprit, a sports complex sustained roof damage that required two days of expedited work to repair.[38] Some residents of Le Pr\u00eacheur had to flee a dangerous lahar triggered by heavy rains.[39] During his four-day tour of the French West Indies, President of France Emmanuel Macron canceled a planned visit to Fort-de-France in response to the storm.[40] Guadeloupe experienced lighter winds but more significant rainfall than Martinique, with precipitation totals reaching 6.81\u00a0in (173\u00a0mm) at Petit-Bourg.[41]"

Given the name Firinga, it moved generally southwestward for much of its duration. While the cyclone was approaching Mauritius late on January\u00a028, it attained peak winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). Firinga passed 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) west of the island, producing 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) wind gusts that destroyed 844\u00a0homes.

Given the name Firinga, the system intensified into a moderate tropical storm on January\u00a026. Two days later, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane while Firinga was approaching Mauritius.[3] Late on January\u00a028, the cyclone passed about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) northwest of the island.[5] Shortly thereafter, MFR upgraded Firinga to tropical cyclone status, estimating 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds[nb 3] of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).

By the next day, this was raised to a level\u00a03 when landfall was imminent.[7] The government of Mauritius also warned the citizens of the approach of the storm.[5] Before affecting R\u00e9union, the cyclone passed near Mauritius with wind gusts up to 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph). Much of the island lost power, water, and telephone access; the water system was disrupted when cleaning systems were damaged. The storm destroyed over 70% of the island's crops, including wrecking 5,000\u00a0metric tons (5,500\u00a0tons) of sugar. In addition, Firinga destroyed 844\u00a0houses in Mauritius. Throughout the island, the cyclone killed one person, injured 507, and left about $60\u00a0million (1989\u00a0USD) in damage.[5] While in the vicinity of R\u00e9union, Firinga produced a minimum pressure of 962\u00a0mbar (28.4\u00a0inHg) at Pointe des Galets. Sustained winds throughout the island reached at least 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) with gusts of over 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph). The peak gust was 216\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) at Saint-Pierre, and the capital Saint-Denis reported gusts of 178\u00a0km/h (111\u00a0mph).[7] In addition to the winds, Firinga dropped record heavy rainfall on R\u00e9union, including a report of 170\u00a0mm (6.7\u00a0in) that broke the record for an hour total at Plaine des Cafres, and 600\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) that broke the record for a six-hour total at Saint-Joseph. Totals from 7am January 29 to 7am January 30 included 1,309\u00a0mm (51.5\u00a0in) at Pas de Bellecombe, and 1,199\u00a0mm (47.2\u00a0in) at Casabois, both of which set 24-hour rainfall records for those locations.[8] Rainfall was lighter along the east and west coasts of the island, but highest in the central plains and in the south, where totals were 1 in 50\u00a0year events. Due to the strong winds possibly disrupting instruments, rainfall totals may have been higher than what were recorded. Firinga also produced high waves along the island, reaching 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) along the eastern coast. The high rainfall resulted in the Rivi\u00e8re Langevin to overflow its banks, causing significant flooding in Saint-Denis. The highest flow rate was 1,100\u00a0m3/s/s (38,846\u00a0ft3/s/s) along the Rivi\u00e8re des Remparts. Several rivers changed their courses due to the high volume of water, and high sediment carried by rivers disrupted lagoon systems. The high rainfall caused 32\u00a0landslides throughout R\u00e9union, most of which were small; however, one in La Plaine-des-Palmistes damaged a road.[7] The floods damaged roads, buildings, and farmlands along their path. At Salazie, the storm destroyed a bridge, which restricted traffic to Cilaos. Coastal roads were damaged, with several washed out near Saint-Pierre; one road had a cut 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) in length. The Rivi\u00e8re Langevin destroyed a bridge, and flooding near Bras-Piton wrecked 400\u00a0m (1,300\u00a0ft) of roads. Road damage alone was estimated at \u20a3137\u00a0million (1989\u00a0francs, US$26\u00a0million).[7][nb 4] At least four towns were isolated due to storm damage.[7] High winds left 60% of the island without power,[10] mostly in the southern portion including Saint-Joseph and Cilaos. The latter town also lost telephone service.[7] Widespread areas lost water access due to flooding washing out two main water lines, affecting about 60,000\u00a0people.[8] High winds left heavy crop damage, mostly to banana trees and vegetables. In L'\u00c9tang-Sal\u00e9, all of the fruit trees were knocked down, and in Entre-Deux, 5,000\u00a0hens and several livestock died. In Sainte-Marie, a landslide wrecked about half of the sugar crop.[7] Island-wide, Firinga destroyed 970\u00a0houses and damaged 1,776\u00a0others,[7] leaving 6,200\u00a0people homeless.[11] Most of the damaged houses were in Saint-Pierre,[7] and the heaviest damage generally occurred in towns along floodplains.[8] During the storm, 10\u00a0people died throughout R\u00e9union,[11] four of whom in the town of Le Tampon.[7] There were also 62\u00a0injuries.[11] Overall damage was initially estimated at around \u20a31\u00a0billion (1989\u00a0francs, $157\u00a0million 1989\u00a0USD).[7][nb 4] On the island, Firinga was the third significant cyclone of the 1980s, after Cyclone Hyacinthe in 1980 and Cyclone Clotilda in 1987.[8]"

No depressions or storms formed during the monsoon season from July to September, the first such instance on record. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean \u2013 the Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent \u2013 and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of four to six storms form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November.[1] Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45\u00b0E and 100\u00b0E are included in the season by the IMD.[2] Overall, there was a total of seven depressions and four cyclonic storms. The most intense and deadly tropical cyclone of the season, the West Bengal cyclone, lashed that province of India and Bangladesh in the month of November. Rough seas offshore caused at least 173\u00a0drownings offshore Bangladesh and India, while over 100\u00a0people were left missing. In West Bengal alone, 124\u00a0fatalities were reported, with over one hundred people still missing. Flooding occurred there and some areas of Bangladesh, particularly the capital city of Dhaka. Another notable storm was the Oman cyclone in May. It made a rare landfall in the Omani region of Dhofar. The storm brought historic rainfall to Oman, which in turn brought flooding to the region. Nine people drowned and damage to property, crops, and transportation reached US$25\u00a0million (2002 dollars)."

The IMD tracked six tropical cyclones, which was below the average of 13 to 14 per season.[3] No storms were active from June to September during the monsoon season,[3] the first such instance of no depressions in the 115\u00a0year record of the IMD.[4] Collectively, the storms of this season resulted in at least 182 deaths and $25\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD) in damage, all of which can be attributed to ARB 01 and BOB 04.[5][6][7] The first storm of the season, ARB 01, developed on May\u00a06 out of an area of low pressure over the Arabian Sea. It peaked winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) before making landfall near Salalah, Oman on May\u00a010. The storm dissipated shortly thereafter.[3] A deep depression, classified as BOB 02, developed in the Andaman Sea on May\u00a010. The deep depression remained disorganized and made landfall near Yangon, Burma before dissipating on May\u00a012.[8] Later that month, a tropical depression, recognized only by the Thailand Meteorological Department, developed in the Bay of Bengal and also made landfall in Burma.[9] Activity in the North Indian Ocean then went dormant for over five months, a direct result of the monsoon season in the region.[3] Tropical cyclogenesis resumed with the development of Tropical Depression BOB 03 forming near Andhra Pradesh on October\u00a022.[10] On November\u00a011, a severe cyclonic storm \u2013 numbered BOB 04 \u2013 developed in the Bay of Bengal. It soon became the strongest tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). BOB 04 made landfall in Bangladesh on November\u00a012, hours before dissipating. Later in November, another cyclonic storm \u2013 assigned to BOB 05 \u2013 formed in the Bay of Bengal on November\u00a023. It moved northward before eventually curving westward and dissipating on November\u00a028.[11] The final tropical cyclone developed southwest of Sri Lanka on December\u00a021. The system headed generally east-northeastward and strengthened into cyclonic storm on December\u00a024, before demising well east of Sri Lanka on the following day.[12]"

However, dry air diminished convection,[3] causing the cyclone to weaken to a depression on May\u00a08 at 0300\u00a0UTC.[13] Nine hours later, it was upgraded back to a deep depression. On May\u00a08, the cyclone turned west-northwestward. Further intensification occurred, with the deep depression becoming a cyclonic storm at 0600\u00a0UTC on May\u00a09. The storm maintained its intensity until weakening slightly early on May\u00a010, while briefly tracking northwestward. Shortly thereafter, it made landfall near Salalah, Oman. The cyclone rapidly weakened and dissipated inland later on May\u00a010.[3] Waves up to 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) lashed the coast of Oman, though no coastal flooding occurred. Wind gusts reaching 106\u00a0km/h (66\u00a0mph) affected some areas of Oman, while light winds were reported in Al Ghaydah, Yemen. The storm brought heavy rainfall to the Dhofar region of Oman, peaking at 251\u00a0mm (9.9\u00a0in) in the city of Qairoon. Areas in the vicinity of the landfall location of the storm experienced the highest precipitation totals in 30\u00a0years.[8] As a result, wadis quickly became rivers, sweeping away cars and drowning nine people.[5][8] Additionally, property, crops, and transportation suffered impacts from flooding.[5] Damage from the storm totaled to $25\u00a0million, all of which was in Oman.[6]"

The system tracked west-northwestward through the Arabian Sea along a trough near the equator. Its thunderstorm activity was enhanced by a ridge to its north, though was also removed from the center. By May\u00a05, the circulation had become better defined, and concurrently the convection increased over the center.[2] After further organization, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as Depression ARB01A on May\u00a06.[1] Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Depression 01A, while located about 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) southeast of Salalah, Oman.[2] After becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression turned to a northwest motion before resuming a track to the west-northwest. On May\u00a07 it intensified into a deep depression,[1] and though its winds had increased, the structure became disorganized as the center became exposed from the thunderstorm activity. The convection waned, due to the influence of dry air from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as from wind shear.[2] As a result, the IMD downgraded it to depression status early on May\u00a08.[1] However, later in the day, convection redeveloped over the western half of the circulation,[2] and it again reached deep depression status, about 830\u00a0km (520\u00a0mi) southeast of Oman.[1] The storm maintained poleward outflow as it continued west-northwestward. Early on May\u00a09 the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm,[1] estimating winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg).[3] Around that time, the storm was estimated by the JTWC to have attained peak winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0km/h),[2] with an atmospheric pressure of 991\u00a0mbar.[4] While located a short distance offshore, the storm turned to the northwest and weakened slightly.

In coastal areas, thousands of Red Crescent volunteers reported for duty in order to assist vulnerable villages in preparation of the storm.[8] Winds destroyed bamboo huts, uprooted trees, and disrupted road transport between towns and villages on the shore of the Bay of Bengal.[2] Torrential rainfall in the area flooded dozens of villages, forcing thousands to evacuate.[9] Heavy precipitation also lashed the capital city of Dhaka, inundating streets, which caused a shutdown of electricity and interrupting public transportation.[2] One death was reported after a man drowned while attempting to cross a river in southern Bhola Island.[10] Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150\u00a0men sank near Cox's Bazar; only 11 of them were known to have survived. An additional eight fishing boats transporting 60\u00a0people was reported missing off of Barisal Division.[9] By November\u00a015, 47\u00a0fishing vessels were still unaccounted for.[2] A navy motor boat also sunk near Kutubdia, though its six crew members swam ashore.[9] In the aftermath of the storm, the number of deaths in Bangladesh rose to 49.[7] Overall, the storm resulted in 173\u00a0confirmed fatalities.[7] Officials in West Bengal accused the meteorological offices of issuing warnings too late, as most of the fishermen were already in deep sea areas.[6] Immediately following the storm, the Indian Red Cross Society and the Participating National Societies began to assess the situation and plan. At a warehouse in Salt Lake City, Kolkata, the Indian Red Cross Society prepared to distribute 2,000\u00a0tarpaulins, 2,000\u00a0blankets, 200\u00a0kitchen sets, and 20,000\u00a0mosquito nets.[11]"

        "content": " Hurricane Edith was the strongest hurricane to form during the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season and the southernmost landfalling Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic at the time. Edith developed from a tropical wave on September\u00a05 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane in the Caribbean Sea. Edith rapidly intensified on September\u00a09 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Being a category 5 hurricane, Edith peaked at only 943 mbar (hPa), making Edith the least intense category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record. It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. After moving across the Gulf of Mexico a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a016. Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September\u00a018. The hurricane killed two people when it passed near Aruba. Striking northeastern Central America as a Category\u00a05 hurricane, Edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35\u00a0people. In Texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage. Edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of Louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm. One tornado, rated F3 on the Fujita Scale, damaged several homes and injured multiple people in Baton Rouge. The tornado outbreak extended eastward into Florida, of which a few destroyed entire buildings. Damage in the United States totaled US$25\u00a0million (1971 USD, $188\u00a0million 2022 USD)."

        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa near Dakar on August\u00a031. It moved westward into the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and organized into a tropical disturbance on September\u00a02 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west, and on September\u00a03, the convection diminished after moving west of 40\u00b0 W.[1] By the next day, the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the clouds of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.[2] The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September\u00a05 while located 255 miles (410\u00a0km) east of Grenada.[1] The depression moved quickly westward, passing through the southern Lesser Antilles early on September\u00a06. The southern portion of the circulation passed over northeastern Venezuela, though after entering the Caribbean Sea, another reconnaissance flight was unable to confirm the existence of a low-level circulation.[2] Shortly thereafter, while moving into an area of light wind shear, it was able to organize and strengthen further, and on September\u00a07, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edith near the island of Cura\u00e7ao. While initially, a cold-core upper-level low persisted about 750 miles (1,210\u00a0km) northwest of the storm, Edith moved west-northwestward due to the influence of a narrow and persistent ridge of high pressure, which extended from the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm continued into open waters of the Caribbean, the upper-level low gradually weakened and was replaced with an anticyclone. This allowed the storm to strengthen further, and on September\u00a08, Edith became a hurricane in the south-central Caribbean Sea.[1] On September\u00a09, the storm rapidly intensified, and within 24\u00a0hours, Edith strengthened from a minimal hurricane to a powerful 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) Category 5 hurricane just off the coast of Nicaragua. The cause for the explosive deepening is unknown, though it is speculated that the transformation in the upper troposphere from an upper-level low to an anticyclone led to a release of baroclinic energy. Reconnaissance aircraft crews in the peak of the storm reported extreme turbulence, causing concern for the safety of the crews. At its peak intensity, the very well-defined \"pinhole\" eye was only 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) in diameter. Late on September\u00a09, Hurricane Edith made landfall on northeastern Nicaragua at Cabo Gracias a Dios.[1] Hurricane Edith rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18\u00a0hours after it made landfall, it emerged into the Gulf of Honduras as an 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken as it moved northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September\u00a011 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters.[1] This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification.[3] As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36\u00a0hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.[1] Edith continued moving to the west-northwest, heading towards the coast of Mexico, but early on September\u00a014, the storm stalled while located just off the coast of Tamaulipas. A mid-latitude trough of low pressure approached the storm, and caused Edith to turn to slowly drift towards the northeast. Located only miles from the Mexican coast, Edith again failed to strengthen until September\u00a015, when it accelerated northeastward and regained hurricane status. The hurricane turned to the east-northeast as it approached the coast of Louisiana, and made landfall on September\u00a016 in a sparsely populated area 30 miles (48\u00a0km) east of Cameron with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a Category\u00a02 hurricane in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Edith rapidly weakened over land, degenerating into a tropical storm over Louisiana, and into a tropical depression over Mississippi. It continued to the east-northeast, and dissipated over northwestern Georgia on September\u00a018.[1]"

While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Warning from Cameron to Morgan City, Louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall. Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area.[4] In Belize, officials ordered the mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas, resulting in hundreds of residents leaving to the United States through the international airport. Officials sent police troops to maintain order and prevent looting.[5] In the Gulf of Mexico, several oil facilities were closed or placed on automatic controls. Drilling rigs as far east as the coastal waters off of Mississippi were prepared to evacuate in the event Edith moved further east than anticipated. Additionally, thousands evacuated coastal areas of Louisiana prior to the arrival of the hurricane. Several shelters opened in coastal cities, and many people prepared for the hurricane by purchasing emergency supplies. Officials closed schools throughout much of southern Louisiana.[6]"

Two fishermen were reported lost at sea and presumed dead as a result of Edith.[1] Edith produced strong winds across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras, with Puerto Lempira reporting an unofficial sustained wind of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h). Press reports indicated every house in the Cape Gracias area was destroyed or heavily damaged, leaving 7,000 homeless. The meteorological service in British Honduras stated there were 100 fatalities near Cape Gracias,[7] though a later report indicated 35\u00a0people died in Nicaragua. There, damage was estimated at over US$380,000 (1971 dollars$, 2.86\u00a0million in 2023 dollars).[8] Three United States Air Force aircraft delivered food, medical supplies, and fuel to the hurricane victims of Nicaragua.[9] In Honduras, the hurricane produced 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) tides and strong winds, while strong waves destroyed 40\u00a0fishing boats as well.[10] While the hurricane reportedly destroyed entire villages,[11] no deaths occurred in Honduras.[1] Offshore islands in Belize reported winds of up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[1] Edith produced flooding in a few towns in the southern portion of the country, with some buildings damaged.

While moving past the state, Edith produced above normal tides of over 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) in locations,[1] which flooded a portion of Highway 87.[12] The storm dropped light to moderate amounts of rainfall peaking at 3.5 inches (89\u00a0mm) in Sabine Pass.[1] The passage of Hurricane Edith resulted in downed trees and power lines, and damage totaling US$180,000 (1971 dollars, $900,000 in 2006 dollars).[12] Off the coast of Louisiana, the hurricane wrecked three boats, but all the occupants were safely rescued.[11] While making landfall in Louisiana, Edith resulted in above normal tides of up to 9.7 feet (3.0\u00a0m) above normal at Cypremont Point near Morgan City.[1] The highest winds reported by a land station were 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) at Cameron, where a wind gust of 96\u00a0mph (154\u00a0km/h) was also reported. However, due to the lack of recording instruments near the hurricane's landing point, whether higher winds occurred there is not known, although likely.[7] Rainfall was moderate across Louisiana, including amounts of over 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) in the southwestern portion of the state.[1] A strong rainband well ahead of the hurricane,[1] combined with the intrusion of dry air into the hurricane's circulation, produced 16 tornadoes from Louisiana to Alabama.[13] An F3 tornado touched down in the eastern residential suburbs of Baton Rouge, causing heavy property damage totaling $2.5\u00a0million (1971 dollars$, 18.8\u00a0million in 2023 dollars) along its intermittent 7 miles (11\u00a0km) path. The tornado also injured three people.[1][14] An F2 tornado in Tangipahoa Parish caused $250,000 in damage (1971 dollars$, 1.88\u00a0million in 2023 dollars) along its 4-mile (6.4\u00a0km) path,[15] while an F1 tornado in St. Martin Parish injured 6\u00a0people on its 3-mile (4.8\u00a0km) path.[16] The hurricane caused extensive damage to the sugar cane crop in southwestern Louisiana.[7] About a month after Edith struck the United States, President Richard Nixon declared portions of Louisiana as a disaster area, which allocated relief funds to aid the affected citizens.[17] In Mississippi, wind gusts peaked at 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) in Hattiesburg, with multiple locations reporting tropical-storm-force winds. Additionally, Edith produced moderate rainfall peaking at 6.15 inches (156\u00a0mm) in Liberty. In Alabama, the storm caused light rains, moderate wind gusts, and a storm tide of 2.7 feet (0.82\u00a0m) in Mobile.[1] Edith spawned four tornadoes in Alabama, three of which were F2 tornadoes. Two touched down in Baldwin County; one destroyed two homes and damaged several others, and the other destroyed two mobile homes, a few barns, and damaged ten houses. Two tornadoes also touched down in Washington County, one of which destroyed several small buildings and downed a few trees.[18] In Florida, Edith produced slightly above-normal tides and light rain. It spawned a tornado in Pensacola, Florida,[1] injuring one person and inflicting $25,000 in damage (1971 dollars, $125,000 in 2006 dollars).[19] Damage throughout the United States totaled $25\u00a0million (1971 dollars$, 188\u00a0million in 2023 dollars), primarily from crop damage in southwest Louisiana.

        "content": " The Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) classifies hurricanes\u2014which in the Western Hemisphere are tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical storms\u2014into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds. This measuring system was formerly known as the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale, or SSHS. To be classified as a hurricane, a tropical cyclone must have one-minute-average maximum sustained winds at 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) above the surface of at least 74\u00a0mph (64\u00a0kn, 119\u00a0km/h; Category\u00a01).[1] The highest classification in the scale, Category\u00a05, consists of storms with sustained winds of at least 157\u00a0mph (137\u00a0kn, 252\u00a0km/h). The classifications can provide some indication of the potential damage and flooding a hurricane will cause upon landfall. The Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale is based on the highest wind speed averaged over a one-minute interval 10\u00a0m above the surface. Although the scale shows wind speeds in continuous speed ranges, the US National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5-knot (kn) increments (e.g., 100, 105, 110, 115 kn, etc.) because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating the strength of tropical cyclones. Wind speeds in knots are then converted to other units and rounded to the nearest 5\u00a0mph or 5\u00a0km/h.[2] The Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale is used officially only to describe hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line. Other areas use different scales to label these storms, which are called cyclones or typhoons, depending on the area. These areas (except the JTWC) use three-minute or ten-minute averaged winds to determine the maximum sustained wind speed, creating an important difference which frustrates direct comparison between maximum wind speeds of storms measured using the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (usually 14% more intense) and those measured using a ten-minute interval (usually 12% less intense).[3] There is some criticism of the SSHWS for not accounting for rain, storm surge, and other important factors, but SSHWS defenders say that part of the goal of SSHWS is to be straightforward and simple to understand. There have also been proposals for the addition of higher categories to the scale (which would then set a maximum cutoff for Category\u00a05), but none have been adopted as of July 2024[update]."

        "header": "History",
        "content": "The scale was developed in 1971 by civil engineer Herbert Saffir and meteorologist Robert Simpson, who at the time was director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).[4] The scale was introduced to the general public in 1973,[5] and saw widespread use after Neil Frank replaced Simpson at the helm of the NHC in 1974.[6] The scale was created by Herbert Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 was commissioned by the United Nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas.[7] While conducting the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring the utility of the Richter magnitude scale for describing earthquakes, he devised a 1\u20135 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding. In 2009, the NHC eliminated pressure and storm surge ranges from the categories, transforming it into a pure wind scale, called the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (Experimental) [SSHWS].[8] The updated scale became operational on May 15, 2010.[9] The scale excludes flood ranges, storm surge estimations, rainfall, and location, which means a Category\u00a02 hurricane that hits a major city will likely do far more cumulative damage than a Category\u00a05 hurricane that hits a rural area.[10] The agency cited examples of hurricanes as reasons for removing \"scientifically inaccurate\" information, including Hurricane Katrina (2005) and Hurricane Ike (2008), which both had stronger than estimated storm surges, and Hurricane Charley (2004), which had weaker than estimated storm surge.[11] Since being removed from the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, storm surge prediction and modeling is handled by computer numerical models such as ADCIRC and SLOSH. In 2012, the NHC expanded the windspeed range for Category\u00a04 by 1\u00a0mph in both directions, to 130\u2013156\u00a0mph, with corresponding changes in the other units (113\u2013136\u00a0kn, 209\u2013251\u00a0km/h), instead of 131\u2013155\u00a0mph (114\u2013135\u00a0kn, 210\u2013249\u00a0km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5\u00a0knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115\u00a0kn is rated Category\u00a04, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3\u00a0mph) would round down to 130\u00a0mph, making it appear to be a Category\u00a03 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135\u00a0kn (~155\u00a0mph, and thus Category\u00a04) is 250.02\u00a0km/h, which, according to the definition used before the change would be Category\u00a05. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115\u00a0kn as 135\u00a0mph, and 135\u00a0kn as 245\u00a0km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115\u00a0kn to be correctly rounded down to 130\u00a0mph, and storms of 135\u00a0kn to be correctly reported as 250\u00a0km/h, and still qualify as Category\u00a04. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in Category\u00a04 in each unit of measure, the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years.[8] The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.[12]"

The U.S. National Hurricane Center classifies hurricanes of Category\u00a03 and above as major hurricanes, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center classifies typhoons of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) or greater (strong Category\u00a04 and Category\u00a05) as super typhoons. Most weather agencies use the definition for sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which specifies measuring winds at a height of 33\u00a0ft (10.1\u00a0m) for 10\u00a0minutes, and then taking the average. By contrast, the U.S. National Weather Service, Central Pacific Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center define sustained winds as average winds over a period of one minute, measured at the same 33\u00a0ft (10.1\u00a0m) height,[13][14] and that is the definition used for this scale. The five categories are described in the following subsections, in order of increasing intensity.[15] Intensity of example hurricanes is from both the time of landfall and the maximum intensity."

The collapse of many wide-span roofs and walls, especially those with no interior supports, is common. Very heavy and irreparable damage to many wood-frame structures and total destruction to mobile/manufactured homes is prevalent. Only a few types of structures are capable of surviving intact, and only if located at least 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8\u00a0km) inland. They include office, condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of solid concrete or steel frame construction, multi-story concrete parking garages, and residences that are made of either reinforced brick or concrete/cement block and have hipped roofs with slopes of no less than 35\u00a0degrees from horizontal and no overhangs of any kind, and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters. Unless most of these requirements are met, the catastrophic destruction of a structure may occur.[8] The storm's flooding causes major damage to the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline, and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge. Virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked, isolating most affected communities. Massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas.

Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm's winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which is based on surface wind speeds, the radius of maximum winds of the storm, and its translational velocity.[19][20] Both of these scales are continuous, akin to the Richter scale;[21] however, neither of these scales have been used by officials.[citation needed]"

        "content": "After the series of powerful storm systems of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as after Hurricane Patricia, a few newspaper columnists and scientists brought up the suggestion of introducing Category\u00a06, and they have suggested pegging Category\u00a06 to storms with winds greater than 174 or 180\u00a0mph (78 or 80\u00a0m/s; 151 or 156\u00a0kn; 280 or 290\u00a0km/h).[10][22] Fresh calls were made for consideration of the issue after Hurricane Irma in 2017,[23] which was the subject of a number of seemingly credible false news reports as a \"Category\u00a06\" storm,[24] partly in consequence of so many local politicians using the term. Only a few storms of this intensity have been recorded. Of the 41\u00a0hurricanes currently considered to have attained Category\u00a05 status in the Atlantic, 18 had wind speeds at 175\u00a0mph (78\u00a0m/s; 152\u00a0kn; 282\u00a0km/h) or greater and only 8 had wind speeds at 180\u00a0mph (80.5\u00a0m/s; 156\u00a0kn; 290\u00a0km/h) or greater (the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Allen, Gilbert, Mitch, Rita, Wilma, Irma, and Dorian). Of the 20\u00a0hurricanes currently considered to have attained Category\u00a05 status in the eastern Pacific, only 5 had wind speeds at 175\u00a0mph (78\u00a0m/s; 152\u00a0kn; 282\u00a0km/h) or greater (Patsy, John, Linda, Rick, and Patricia), and only 3 had wind speeds at 180\u00a0mph (80.5\u00a0m/s; 156\u00a0kn; 290\u00a0km/h) or greater (Linda, Rick, and Patricia). Most storms which would be eligible for this category were typhoons in the western Pacific, most notably typhoons Tip,  Halong, Mawar, and Bolaven in 1979, 2019, 2023 and 2023 respectively, each with sustained winds of 190\u00a0mph (305\u00a0km/h),[25] and typhoons Haiyan, Meranti, Goni, and Surigae in 2013, 2016, 2020 and 2021 respectively, each with sustained winds of 195\u00a0mph (315\u00a0km/h). Occasionally, suggestions of using even higher wind speeds as the cutoff have been made. In a newspaper article published in November 2018, NOAA research scientist Jim Kossin said that the potential for more intense hurricanes was increasing as the climate warmed, and suggested that Category 6 would begin at 195\u00a0mph (85\u00a0m/s; 170\u00a0kn; 315\u00a0km/h), with a further hypothetical Category 7 beginning at 230\u00a0mph (105\u00a0m/s; 200\u00a0kn; 370\u00a0km/h).[26] In 2024 another proposal to add \"Category 6\" was made, with a minimum wind speed of  192\u00a0mph (309\u00a0km/h), with risk factors such as the effects of climate change and warming ocean temperatures part of that research.[27] In the NHC area of responsibility, only Patricia had winds greater than 190\u00a0mph (85\u00a0m/s; 165\u00a0kn; 305\u00a0km/h). According to Robert Simpson, co-creator of the scale, there are no reasons for a Category\u00a06 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale because it is designed to measure the potential damage of a hurricane to human-made structures. Simpson explained that \"...\u00a0when you get up into winds in excess of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h) you have enough damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building it's going to cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it's engineered.\"[6] Nonetheless, the counties of Broward and Miami-Dade in Florida have building codes which require that critical infrastructure buildings be able to withstand Category\u00a05 winds.[28]"

A strip of pale green land, free of settlements, separates the forest from the slide. This region had been deforested since 2007, according to the government analysis.[11] On a steep slope, trees anchor the soil. Deforested mountains are very prone to landslides.[11]"

Hence, it is thought to be the coldest December across Great Britain since before 1659.[2] The winter of 2010 in England saw the earliest widespread winter snowfall since 1993 with snow falling as early as 24 November across Northumberland and North Yorkshire. A maximum snow depth of 76\u00a0cm (30\u00a0in) was recorded on 1 December in the Peak District, Sheffield, Doncaster, the Cotswold Hills and the Forest of Dean.[citation needed] In this event Scotland and Northern England were most severely affected. On 9 December temperatures recovered across much of the UK, causing a partial thaw. Later, on Thursday 16 December a cold front reintroduced a cold, arctic airstream. This cold spell brought further snow and ice chaos back to Ireland and Britain with Southern England, Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland bearing the brunt of the wintry conditions. This led to severe disruption to the road and rail network with several airports being closed including London Heathrow Airport for a time. Several local temperature records were broken including a new record low for Northern Ireland of \u221218.7\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22121.7\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded at Castlederg on 23 December 2010. By the new year a thaw had begun, and there was no recurrence of the extreme conditions for the remainder of the winter. There was some snowfall in early January, and there was an anticyclonic spell at the end of the month that brought some cold, frosty days. February was above average in temperature and ended on a mild note, although the snow returned in much of Scotland during March."

Snow depths elsewhere were between 5\u201330\u00a0cm (2\u201312\u00a0in) widely. Temperatures fell widely below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C (14\u00a0\u00b0F) with some areas staying sub-zero by day. On 2 December there was particularly low temperatures in major towns and cities, particularly in Scotland where it dropped to \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C (0\u00a0\u00b0F) in Aberdeen and on 3 December temperatures in England broke records. However, the lowest temperature of the winter of \u221221.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22126.2\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded at Altnaharra, Sutherland at 10\u00a0am on 2 December and Braemar and Kinbrace both dropped to \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F) on the night of 2 December. 7 people have been confirmed to have died due to the cold weather."

The main runway at Dublin Airport due to snow and ice for most of the day.[25] Later in November, the Met Office's warnings remained in place across much of the UK, with Scotland and North East England predicted to have the heaviest snowfalls, with new warnings in place for icy roads in Northern Ireland and Wales.[26] Snow was causing problems on some roads, with gritters deployed as temperatures dipped to -3\u00a0\u00b0C (27\u00a0\u00b0F).[24] The AA reportedly faced a 40% increase in call-outs, compared to an average November.[27] Motorists in Wales and Northern Ireland struggled with icy roads while Scotland was facing more heavy snow and drifts thanks to a biting wind.[27] The CET (Central England Temperature) was \u22124.0\u00a0\u00b0C (24.8\u00a0\u00b0F) on 28 November, the lowest November CET mean since \u22124.6\u00a0\u00b0C (23.7\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded on 24 November 1904.[28] The lowest temperature of the month was also recorded on this day, with \u221217.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.5\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded at Llysdinam, Wales.

Up to 40\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) of snow was recorded in Rotherham and Sheffield, 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) of fresh snow in Mansfield[30] (bringing total depths to over 30\u00a0cm), 20 to 30\u00a0cm (8 to 12\u00a0in) in Leeds, 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in Pontefract and up to 40\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) in parts of Lincolnshire.[citation needed] On 3 December, an all-time record low of \u221217.9\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22120.2\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded at RAF Leeming (since records began at Leeming in 1945) and \u221219.0\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22122.2\u00a0\u00b0F) at RAF Topcliffe in North Yorkshire.[31] By 6 December, snowfall in the Central Belt in Scotland led to the closure of the M8 motorway for two days with hundreds of motorists stranded overnight. The resulting political furore led to the resignation of Scottish Minister for Transport, Stewart Stevenson.[32] By mid-December, a cold front reached the Shetland Isles and moved southwards across Scotland. Mild air preceded the front, with cold air straight from the Arctic following it, resulting in some rapid temperature drops throughout Scotland and its Isles. An unofficial temperature of 11.6\u00a0\u00b0C (52.9\u00a0\u00b0F), the highest of the month so far, was recorded near Lairg, Scottish Highlands at around 7pm in the milder air.[33] The cold front continued to move southwards across the UK passing Northern Ireland and Northern England. Later in December, the M5 became gridlocked, and shops in the Birmingham area closed early on the last Saturday before Christmas.[citation needed] A number of passengers travelling by coach had to spend the night at Birmingham Coach Station due to not only coaches for onwards destinations being unable to depart and arrive Birmingham, but also widespread disruption to train services making onwards alternatives impossible.[citation needed] Airports including Heathrow Airport closed some its runways for a time, with Gatwick also cancelling a number of flights.[34][35] A minimum temperature of \u221219.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22123.3\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded in Shawbury, Shropshire.[36] And a minimum temperature of \u221217.6\u00a0\u00b0C (0.3\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded at Castlederg, a new record for Northern Ireland and \u221219.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22123.3\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded at Chesham, Buckinghamshire.[35] Heavy snow fall was also reported over large parts of Devon causing major travel disruption.[37] Dublin Airport and City of Derry Airport were forced to fully close, 15\u00a0cm (6\u00a0inches) of snow was recorded at Dublin Airport.[38] Only three days after breaking the record minimum for Northern Ireland, Castlederg broke the record again with a low of \u221218.7\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22121.7\u00a0\u00b0F).[39] On 24 December, it was decided to cancel the 27th IRFU's Celtic League meeting with Leinster as Ulster's Ravenhill pitch froze under heavy snow.[citation needed] Both northern and southern Ireland were under heavy snow.[40] 25 December 2010 was also the coldest Christmas Day since 1830, with a CET of \u22125.9\u00a0\u00b0C (21.4\u00a0\u00b0F).[41] The Republic of Ireland's lowest-ever December temperature on record was also recorded on Christmas Day, at \u221217.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.5\u00a0\u00b0F) at Straide, County Mayo.[citation needed] At the end of December, thousands of homes and businesses in Northern Ireland and Wales were without water as melting snow and ice revealed many burst pipes.

Toward the end of the month, however, wind shear decreased in the easternmost portion of the basin, which allowed a low-level circulation to develop; it is possible the system originated from a tropical wave that traversed the Atlantic Ocean in the previous two weeks. Deep convection increased over the circulation on May 31, prompting classifications with the Dvorak technique. Based on satellite imagery, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression One-E early on June\u00a01, about 345 miles (555\u00a0km) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.[2] The tropical cyclone was never well-organized, and after its formation, the convection became elongated. As the entire system moved northwestward, another circulation developed which eventually became the dominant center, causing the original circulation to dissipate. Midday on June\u00a02, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Andres. The next day, steering winds forced the storm east-northeastward, and on June 4, Andres attained peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). A trough bypassed the storm to the north and changed the steering flow toward the southeast. This produced a track paralleling the Central America coastline; such a track was considered \"unprecedented\" by the National Hurricane Center in the database for all eastern Pacific storms. Initially, the storm was expected to continue moving toward Mexico and Guatemala.[2] Turning southeastward, Tropical Storm Andres passed about 35 miles (56\u00a0km) off the coast of Guatemala, before it began weakening due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The convection became amorphous and later shifted to the southeast of the circulation. On June\u00a06 Andres weakened to tropical depression status. It turned northward and moved ashore near San Salvador, El Salvador on June\u00a07, which was the first recorded landfall in the country. The low-level circulation quickly dissipated over land, although the mid-level circulation persisted across Central America. After the featured reached the western Caribbean Sea, a new surface circulation developed, and initially, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated the development of a significant storm in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Instead, the system remained disorganized, bringing rainfall to Cuba, Florida, and the Bahamas before it was absorbed by a weak trough in the Gulf of Mexico.[2]"

Later, a tropical storm watch was issued for Guatemala and El Salvador, but it was quickly canceled.[2] Due to the threat of the storm, officials closed ports along the southern Mexican coastline, and also advised for small boats to excise caution.[3] Throughout its life, Andres produced rainfall along the coast of Mexico, in Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas, as well as through the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The highest total in the country was 11.42 inches (29.0\u00a0cm) in Mazat\u00e1n, Chiapas.[4] Heavy rainfall and high seas spread across western Central America. In El Salvador and Nicaragua, the storm led to power outages, traffic accidents, and overflown rivers,[2] as well as destroyed bridges and buildings in Nicaragua.[5] Two fishermen were left missing in Nicaragua,[2] and the storm damaged 91\u00a0houses and destroyed 82\u00a0more, leaving a total of 1,259\u00a0people homeless.[6] There were 4\u00a0deaths in El Salvador where Andres made landfall.[7] The remnants of Andres brought rainfall to Cuba, Florida, and the Bahamas.[2] In Florida, the system produced a daily record precipitation of 5.89 inches (15.0\u00a0cm) at the Miami International Airport; the rainfall led to street flooding, accidents, and housing damage.[8]"

It has been called one of the ten worst natural disasters in Canadian history.[1] The preceding summer had been unusually hot and dry. Fire rangers, anticipating the upcoming \"burn\" season, had requested to stay in the area but were not granted permission. They left at the end of the fire season in mid September, leaving the area without fire protection services. In the fall when burning permits were no longer required, farmers and settlers started to set small bush fires to clear the land. Dry conditions had persisted past the usual \"burn\" season and on October 4, the wind turned into hurricane-force gales, fanning the flames out of control and combining the brush fires into one large inferno.[2] Over two days, the fire consumed an area of 1,680 square kilometres (650\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[1] affecting 18 townships in Ontario. It completely destroyed the communities of North Cobalt, Charlton, Thornloe, Heaslip, and numerous smaller settlements. Englehart and New Liskeard were partly burnt. In all 43 people died.[3] In Quebec, the communities of Notre-Dame-du-Nord and neighbouring Notre-Dame-des-Quinze were also devastated.[4] The fires were extinguished when the winds abated and rain and snow began to fall on October 5, 1922.[3] One of the towns hit hardest was Haileybury which burnt down within 3 to 6 hours. Thick smoke caused panic and confusion. The town's residents were forced to take refuge in the cold waters of Lake Timiskaming and cover themselves with wet blankets.[2] The fire destroyed over 90% of the town, killing 11 residents, leaving 3500 people homeless, and causing $2 million of damage.[1] The people of Charlton took refuge in the power house; a baby was born there that night. The Power House later[when?] burned while being used for grain grinding. It was later rebuilt and a plaque was placed to commemorate the fire. An area of 246,000 hectares was destroyed in the fire.[clarification needed] Hardships remained for the survivors, who had lost all their belongings and faced the approaching winter. Consequently, a large emergency relief program was organized for the affected area.[3] The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), with many retired street cars in its yards, sent many old car bodies to serve as houses during the reconstruction. Some of these cars remained for years, and one has recently been restored and is in the museum at Haileybury.[5] Furthermore, the fire had consumed all the nearby forests, causing a severe shortage of firewood and forcing people for many years to travel far in order to obtain it.[4]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical cyclone and named storm of the annual Atlantic hurricane season that caused minimal flooding in the Carolinas in mid-June\u00a01996. Arthur originated from an area of increased convection east of the Bahamas on June\u00a016. Gradually, the system increased in organization, and was designated as a tropical depression on June\u00a017. The depression tracked north-northwest and became Tropical Storm Arthur while just offshore the Southeastern United States on June\u00a019. Later that day, Arthur peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h), but weakened slightly before making landfall in North Carolina early the following day. After striking North Carolina, Arthur tracked out to sea and weakened further to a tropical depression. By June\u00a021, Arthur transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Overall, impact from Arthur was minimal, limited to light rainfall and moderate surf in North and South Carolina, as well as a tornado in Florida. Total damage amounted to $1\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD), but no fatalities were reported.[1]"

        "content": "On June\u00a016, satellite imagery revealed an area of increased convection east of the Bahamas, which was believed to have been associated with a tropical wave.[2] On June\u00a017, the convection increased in organization at the lower levels of the atmosphere. By 1800\u00a0UTC, the system had organized sufficiently to be designated as a tropical depression, making it the first of the season. Initially, the depression tracked north-northwest under the steering currents of the low-level flow around the western periphery of the Atlantic subtropical ridge. Strong wind shear due to fast upper-level winds associated with a cold-core low over the eastern Gulf of Mexico hindered further intensification for a time, but on June\u00a018, an area of deep convection developed north of the center of circulation. Based on analysis of reconnaissance data, the tropical depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur at 1900\u00a0UTC on June\u00a019.[3] Further strengthening occurred, as the storm attained peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h).[2] With time, Arthur gradually turned northeast and made landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina early on June\u00a020. The center moved over the Pamlico Sound and the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and exited into the Atlantic. Although the storm contained minimal deep convection, satellite imagery indicated that Arthur had a well-defined low-level center. The tropical storm weakened to a tropical depression about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) northeast of Cape Hatteras, and accelerated towards the northeast when westerly steering currents increased. Deep convection increased once again on June\u00a021, although the lack of symmetry indicated that the remnants of Arthur were losing tropical characteristics. Forward speed increased to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) and the storm subsequently lost all tropical characteristics at 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a021, while centered about 350\u00a0mi (560\u00a0km) north-northeast of Bermuda. The extratropical remnants tracked northeastward for 36\u00a0hours, and were last identified about midway between Newfoundland and the Azores, where it was absorbed by a much larger extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic.[3]"

Shortly thereafter, a tropical storm watch was issued north of Cape Lookout to the North Carolina/Virginia border, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. The tropical storm watch was later extended from the North Carolina/Virginia border to Cape Charles, Virginia, including Virginia Beach. By late on June\u00a019, all advisories were discontinued.[3] One tornado touched down in Florida, causing no known fatalities or injuries.[4] As the center of Arthur passed 75\u00a0mi (121\u00a0km) east of Cape Romain, South Carolina, minor increases in surf were reported. In North Carolina, swells ranged as high as 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m).[1] Rainfall peaked at 5.85 inches (149\u00a0mm) in Georgetown, South Carolina,[5] though because it fell gradually, no significant flooding was reported,[6] other than minor ponding of water on roads.[7] In addition, Arthur also brought precipitation to Georgia and Virginia, though the amounts of rainfall recorded rarely exceeded 3 inches (76\u00a0mm). Sustained winds of 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) were reported, and offshore, the Atlantic Huron reported a sustained wind of 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) at 1500\u00a0UTC on June\u00a019, while located 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) southeast of Arthur's center. In addition, a C-Man station located about 34.5\u00a0mi (55.5\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina reported sustained winds of 39\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) and gusts up to 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h).[3] Overall, damage caused by Arthur was minimal, totaling only $1\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD).[1]"

Snowfall may have occurred elsewhere, but settler population was sparse outside of New England at that time. The Great Snow is considered one of the benchmark storms in New England, often compared to the Great Blizzard of 1888 in severity.[1] The Great Snow, depending on the source, began on February 27 or March 1. On February 27 a typical New England nor'easter passed through, with snow falling on some areas and other places receiving a mix of snow, sleet, and rain.[2] The first major snowstorm occurred on March 1, with another on the 4th, and a third, the worst among the three, on the 7th. At some points, the snow would lighten and stop, but the sky would remain cloudy, showing no signs of clearing.[3][2] Some of the oldest Native Americans had said that even their ancestors never spoke of a storm of this magnitude.[4] Boston received around 40 inches (100\u00a0cm) of snow, while some places north of the city reached up to 60 inches (150\u00a0cm).[2] In Hampton, New Hampshire,[5] the snow was so deep that people could only leave their houses from the second floor on the lee side of the house, implying actual snow depths of as much as 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) or more.[3] Many single-story homes were buried completely, without even the chimney showing. On the larger residences, drifts reached the third-story window on the windward side.[3] Large expanses of snow were 10\u201315 feet (3.0\u20134.6\u00a0m) deep, with some significant drifts 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) deep.[4] The post roads were impassable until at least March 15, with the mailmen describing snow drifts 6\u201314 feet (1.8\u20134.3\u00a0m) from Boston to Portsmouth more than a week after the storm.[6] Travel was also impossible for a time from New York City to Boston.[7] The geographic scope of the storm is unknown, due to the scarce population and poor record-keeping of the day. Most information is known only from private diaries. The snow was known to be several feet deep around Philadelphia, New York City, New London, Connecticut, Boston and Portsmouth, New Hampshire.[2][6][8]"

The second named storm of the season, Bret quickly developed from a tropical wave on June 28 in the Bay of Campeche. Failing to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm intensity, the system made landfall in Veracruz the following day. It rapidly weakened once onshore, dissipating early on June\u00a030. The storm brought heavy rainfall to Veracruz, San Luis Potos\u00ed, and Tamaulipas with the former suffering the brunt of the impacts. Approximately 11,000 people were adversely affected by widespread flooding. A total of 2,129 homes were damaged and 25 were destroyed, mostly in the city of Naranjos. Three people were killed in storm-related incidents and total losses exceeded 100\u00a0million pesos (US$9.3\u00a0million). The Government of Veracruz declared emergencies for nine municipalities and released tens of millions of pesos in relief aid in conjunction with national agencies."

        "content": "A tropical wave accompanied by a weak surface low-pressure area crossed Central America and eastern Mexico from June 24 through June 27. The system emerged over the Bay of Campeche early on June 28,[1] with associated convective activity increasing. Unfavorable upper-level wind shear and land interaction was expected to inhibit significant development as the system moved west-northwest.[1][2] However, environmental conditions soon became more favorable and the disturbance developed more organized convection and banding features.[3] Based on data from hurricane hunters, the system coalesced into a tropical depression with a small, well-defined center by 18:00\u00a0UTC while located about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) northeast of the city of Veracruz.[1][4] A mid-level ridge to the north steered the depression west-northwest, a motion which it largely maintained through its dissipation. Soon after its formation, the cyclone strengthened into a tropical storm and was assigned the name Bret by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The system reached its peak intensity around 22:35\u00a0UTC with maximum sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,002\u00a0mbar (1,002\u00a0hPa; 29.6\u00a0inHg).[1] Forecasters at the NHC noted that the system's small size could lead to abrupt fluctuations in strength and organization.[5] After its initial quick formation, convection waxed and waned throughout June\u00a029 and the NHC assessed no change in strength as the storm approached land.[5][6] Shortly before landfall, imagery from NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission depicted the storm's structure improving and the system may have intensified as it moved ashore. Regardless, Bret made landfall around 12:00\u00a0UTC just to the south-southeast of Tuxpan, Veracruz. Soon after moving over land Bret degraded into a tropical depression.[1] For several hours, the cyclone maintained a well-organized structure with deep convection at its core.[7] The mountainous terrain of Mexico subsequently took its toll on Bret, leading to its surface center decoupling from the convection aloft. The former turned northwest while the later continued west-northwest over central Mexico.[8] Bret ultimately dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 06:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a030.[1]"

        "content": "Upon the operational classification of Tropical Depression Two at 22:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a028, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for areas between the city of Veracruz and Tampico.[1][9] This was rescinded less than 24-hours later as the storm moved inland and dissipated.[1] Red alerts for rain were issued in 72 of Veracruz's 212 municipalities.[10] In Tampico, alerts were issued over the threat of heavy rain.[11] Tropical Storm Bret produced heavy rainfall along its path, with a peak 24\u2011hour rainfall total of 266\u00a0mm (10.47\u00a0in) recorded in El Raudal, Veracruz;[12] several other locations reported over 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[1] Heavy rains extended into the neighboring states of San Luis Potos\u00ed and Tamaulipas.[10] Landslides from the flooding cut communications and left 66\u00a0villages temporarily isolated.[13] The rainfall caused widespread flooding in Veracruz,[1] especially in the city of Naranjos where the Tancoch\u00edn River overflowed and inundated portions of the city with 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) of water.[10][13] Approximately 1,600 homes were damaged or destroyed in Naranjos, affecting 6,000 people.[14] Roughly 3,000 people required rescue in the city.[15] Two vehicles were swept away in the torrent, leading to the death of one person.[10] In Papantla, the Tlahuanapa bridge collapsed severing access to Agua Dulce. Approximately 700 people from 20 communities in Cazones de Herrera were rendered homeless.[10] Extensive damage occurred in and around Santiago Tuxtla, with 20 bridges damaged and 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) of dirt roads destroyed.[16] Approximately 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of crops were damaged or destroyed and many heads of cattle were lost in Santiago Tuxtla.[10] Overall, 22 municipalities reported damage during the passage of Bret across Veracruz with 14 requesting emergency declarations.[10][17] Nine municipalities were declared disaster areas on July\u00a013 by the state government.[18] Effects were greatest in Benito Ju\u00e1rez, Chinampa de Gorostiza, Naranjos, Tamal\u00edn, Tamiahua, Tantima, Tempoal.[19] On July\u00a02, the Secretariat of Health issued a health emergency over the possibility of a post-storm disease outbreak in Cerro Azul, Chinampa de Gorostiza, Naranjos, and Tuxpan.[14] Approximately 7,500 families (11,000 people) were directly affected by the storm, of whom 3,600 required evacuation. A total of 2,129 homes were damaged and 25 were destroyed, with total losses from Bret exceeding 100\u00a0million pesos (US$9.3\u00a0million).[17][14] Bret killed three people in Mexico: one each in Naranjos and Cerro Azul while the third was unspecified.[20][21] Shortly after the passage of the storm, the government of Veracruz opened 6,000\u00a0emergency storm shelters for impacted citizens. The Mexican Army, combined with the efforts of police officers and state officials, worked with amphibious vehicles to rescue families in flooded houses, of whom many waited on rooftops.[13] One million pesos (US$93,000) was provided to Santiago Tuxtla to repair road infrastructure.[16] In the two months following Bret, three more tropical cyclones impacted Veracruz and caused further damage: Emily, Gert, and Jose.[19] After initially promising tens of millions of pesos in relief funds, the National Fund for Natural Disasters (Fonden) lagged behind on distributions. By November, more than four months after the storm, President Vicente Fox's government was accused of stealing these funds as none had been distributed. A meeting was held on November\u00a08 to discuss the accusations and Fonden director Carlos Bayo stated that 45\u00a0million pesos were deposited in a Banobras trust on September\u00a022.[22] On November\u00a011, the Governor of Veracruz clarified that funds were delayed after the successive impacts of multiple hurricanes after Bret and 25\u00a0million pesos were provided on November\u00a09.[22][23] Nearly 220\u00a0million pesos were provided to Fonden following Hurricane Stan in October for relief and reconstruction.[23]"

Of the season's five tropical cyclones, three reached hurricane status. However, none of them strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Along with 1901, this was the first time that two consecutive seasons lacked a major hurricane since 1864 and 1865.[1] Only one storm left significant impact, which was the second hurricane. It brought flooding and strong winds to Texas, resulting in severe damage in some areas. A tornado spawned by the storm also caused five fatalities. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 28, the lowest value since 1890. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

The depression moved north-northeastward and intensified into a tropical storm early the next day. Later on June\u00a013, the storm made landfall in modern-day Artemisa Province of Cuba with winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h). After reaching the Gulf of Mexico late on June\u00a013, the system continued to strengthen and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). Around 23:00\u00a0UTC, it made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, at the same intensity.[3] After moving inland, the storm moved northeastward and slowly weakened. Around midday on June\u00a016, the system became extratropical over southeastern Virginia and then accelerated northeastward, before dissipating near Anticosti Island, Quebec, late on the following day.[3] Some locations in Florida observed tropical storm force winds.[2] In Virginia, the steamer Falcon sank 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) southeast of False Cape.

Six hours later, the hurricane attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). However, it then began to weaken falling to tropical storm status late on June\u00a026. At 21:00\u00a0UTC that day, the storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas, with winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h). After moving inland, the system quickly weakened and became extratropical over Oklahoma by midday on June\u00a028. The remnants moved rapidly northeastward before dissipating over Pennsylvania the next day.[3] A drought existed in Texas for the previous six weeks. Thus, rainfall produce by this storm was beneficial to cotton and rice. However, withered corn stalks were easily blown down by the wind. Further, heavy precipitation in some areas resulted in flooding. The highest 24-hour rainfall total was 14.22\u00a0in (361\u00a0mm) at Nacogdoches, setting a daily rainfall record for June. This swelled Lanana and Bonita creeks. All bridges were swept away and communication was cut off, while the south side of town was underwater. At Galveston, 5.54\u00a0in (141\u00a0mm) of rain fell on June\u00a027, setting a daily rainfall record.

In Gregg and Harrison counties, heavy rains washed out the Texas and Pacific railroads. Flooding occurred across the upper Sabine basin as well.[5] Strong winds also buffeted portions of the state, with gusts up to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) in Galveston. A freight train was blown off the track at East Bernard in Wharton County. A tornado moved northeast through Krasna, near\nWallis, killing five people. In El Campo, fruit fell off trees. Windmills and chimneys were blown down in Edna, while in Ganado and Louise, outhouses and barns were destroyed. In Houston, trees were uprooted and outhouses destroyed by the gale. Electric wires were downed. Trees were uprooted and damage to sorghum crops were reported in Lavaca County. The remnants of the storm produced heavy rainfall in Missouri and tornadoes in Indiana. The storm in Great Plains set up a cold and moist easterly wind which caused colder than normal temperatures in Nebraska and a rare late June snowstorm in Denver, Colorado; up to 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) was observed.[5]"

Late on September\u00a016, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fran, shortly before brushing Cape Verde, and then moving further out to sea. The storm approached hurricane status on September\u00a017 and September\u00a018, though it eventually weakened. Beginning on September\u00a019, Fran encountered strong wind shear, which contributed to further weakening. By September\u00a020, Fran dissipated well east of the Lesser Antilles. While passing southeast of Cape Verde, the storm produced torrential rainfall. At least 1,094\u00a0houses were severely damaged due to flooding, which left at least 2,100\u00a0people homeless. Significant damage also occurred to roads in the country, which was still in need of repairs as late as January\u00a01985.

The system rapidly organized, and at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, it developed into a tropical depression while located to the southeast of the Cape Verde.[1][2] Early on September\u00a016, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fran, based on intensity estimates via the Dvorak technique. By then, the storm had begun a track to the northwest; Fran then passed near the southernmost islands of Cape Verde. Late on September\u00a017, Fran attained peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.35\u00a0inHg). It maintained this intensity for about 24\u00a0hours,[2] during which time Fran turned to the west and later to the west-southwest due to high-pressure area located over the northeastern Atlantic.[3] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not upgrade the cyclone to Tropical Storm Fran until September\u00a018, after receiving confirmation from satellite imagery and sparse ship reports.[3] The NHC predicted late on September\u00a018 that Fran would slowly strengthen.[3] However, a strong upper-level trough and likely a cutoff low-pressure area instead generated strong wind shear over Fran on September\u00a019.[4] Consequently, the cyclone weakened as deep convection became detached center of the storm, with Fran falling to tropical depression status at 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020.[1] The NHC operationally downgraded the storm 10\u00a0hours later and predicted that Fran would likely dissipate by the next day.[4] Around 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, the storm dissipated while located about 1,250 miles (2,010\u00a0km) east-northeast of Antigua,[2] with the remnants becoming unidentifiable on September\u00a021.[1]"

Overall, the storm caused at least $2.84\u00a0million (1984\u00a0USD) in damage.[5] Although extensive impacts occurred due to flooding, rainfall generated by Fran refilled underground water reserves, improving agricultural aspects in Cape Verde, which had been suffering from a drought.[7] Elsewhere, the storm caused no damage or fatalities.[1] On October\u00a010, 1984, the Government of Cape Verde appealed for international assistance. Emergency relief aid requested included: two-month supply of food for 1,124\u00a0families, 1,064\u00a0mattresses, 532\u00a0kerosene stoves, 2,128\u00a0sets of dinner ware, 2,128\u00a0mugs, 1,064\u00a0cooking pots and pans, 532\u00a0water buckets, 2,128\u00a0sheets, 1,064\u00a0blankets, 2,660\u00a0articles of clothing, and building materials for repair of the 1,094\u00a0houses. In January\u00a01985, the government of Cape Verde announced that they had made significant progress with relief assistance. However, repairs to roads, infrastructure, and crops were still required. Five organizations contributed cash, including the National Solidarity Movement, the Cape Verde Red Cross, Chinese Red Cross, Oxfam Novib, and Oxfam of the United Kingdom; donations collectively totaled to $172,221 (1984\u00a0USD). France, Finland, the Soviet Union, and the United States supplied 4000\u00a0tons of cereals, $79,000 (1984\u00a0USD) to the Red Cross, $250,000 (1984\u00a0USD) for home repairs, 32\u00a0packages of medicines, and 17\u00a0packages of blankets.[5]"

Much of the devastation was attributed to a two-metre storm surge created by the storm which coincided with a perigean spring tide; the Bay of Fundy having one of the highest tidal ranges in the world. The Saxby Gale storm surge produced a water level which gave Burntcoat Head, Nova Scotia, the honor of having the highest tidal range ever recorded. It is also thought to have formed the long gravel beach that connects Partridge Island, Nova Scotia, to the mainland. The storm also produced waves which, combined with the storm surge, breached dikes protecting low-lying farmland in the Minas Basin and the Tantramar Marshes, sending ocean waters surging far inland to inundate farms and communities. Sailing ships in various harbors were tossed about and/or broken up against wharves and breakwaters which were also destroyed. Farmers trying to rescue livestock from fields along shorelines drowned after dikes were breached. There were at least 37\u00a0deaths between Maine, New Brunswick, and New York.[3] The gale destroyed miles of the newly completed Windsor and Annapolis Railway along the Minas Basin near Horton and Wolfville, Nova Scotia."

        "content": "The storm (which pre-dated the practice of naming hurricanes) was given the name \"Saxby\" in honor of Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby, Royal Navy, who was a naval instructor and amateur astronomer.  Lt. Saxby had written a letter of warning, published December 25, 1868, in London's The Standard newspaper in which he notes the astronomical forces predicted for October 5, 1869, which would produce extremely high tides in the North Atlantic Ocean during the height of hurricane season.  Lt. Saxby followed this warning with a reminder published on September 16, 1869, to The Standard in which he also warns of a major \"atmospheric disturbance\" that would coincide with the high water level at an undetermined location.  Many newspapers took up Saxby's warning in the coming days. In a monthly weather column published October 5, 1869, in Halifax's The Evening Express, amateur meteorologist Frederick Allison relayed Lt. Saxby's warning for a devastating storm the following week. Despite the warning, many readers throughout the United Kingdom, Canada, Newfoundland and the United States dismissed Saxby since there were frequent gales and hurricanes during the month of October.  The fact that the high tides occurred throughout the North Atlantic basin was unremarkable and astronomically predictable, except for their coinciding with the hurricane which struck the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy to produce the devastating storm surge.  Lt. Saxby's predictions were considered quite lunatic at the time. Some believed that his predictions were founded upon astrology, which was not the case."

        "content": "\"COMING WEATHER\" TO THE EDITOR Sir, \u2013 on the 1st June, 1863, you, in your journal, kindly permitted me to offer a special warning as to the period between the 10th and 13th December of that year. After giving my reasons for expecting very serious weather in that December, I said, \"Now let any man tell me what other influence can be adduced to coincide for that period so as to increase the chance of our having the most destructive storm and the most dangerous tide with which the earth can without miracle be visited.\" Well-known and widely-known fulfillments justified this prediction, and those results are my apology for asking permission to acquaint the world through your columns with what threatens, not only us in Great Britain, but all parts of the earth as about to happen in the coming year. Some of your readers may probably be incredulous as to weather warnings given so long an interval before an expected danger: allow me, therefore, first to give at least one authentic instance of absolute fulfillment (as published by me some time early in 1864). A stranger to me, Captain Sturley, of Burnhamovery, wrote to me on 2d November, 1863, as follows: \u2013 \"Observing your letter in the Standard of 1st June,\" &c., \u2026 \"would you still advise us to take every precaution against this coming tide?\" (I strongly renewed my advice as to the sea walls of the Lincolnshire and Norfolk fens). On 21st December, 1863, he again wrote: \u2013 \"the tide made its appearance much earlier than usual \u2013 at 7:45 (a.m. Sunday 13th), the tide was at its highest, being a very large tide; should we have had a gale from the northwest it would have overflowed all our banks. I think you were perfectly justified in giving warning. I may say your warning has induced a long neglected sea bank to be put in repair.\" I need to say no more, except that on the same day (Dec.13) the dock master of the Victoria Dock, London, found 30\u00a0feet water on the dock sill, which enabled him to dock the largest merchant ship afloat (The Great Republic), and also the ironclad Monitor (their being an excessive rise of about eight feet). I now beg leave to the state, with regard to 1869, that at seven a.m., on October 5, the moon will be at that part of her orbit which is nearest to the earth. Her attraction will, therefore, be at its maximum force. At noon of the same day the moon will be on the earth's equator, a circumstance which never occurs without mark atmospheric disturbance, and at two p.m. of the same day lines drawn from the earth center would cut the sun and moon in the same arc of right ascension (the moon's attraction and the sun's attraction will therefore be acting in the same direction); in other words, the new moon will be on the earth's equator when in perigee, and nothing more threatening can, I say, occur without miracle. (The earth, it is true, will not be in perihelion and by some 16 or 17 seconds of semi-diameter.) With your permission, I will, during September next, for the safety of mariners, briefly reminding your readers of this warning. In the meantime there will be time for the repair of unsafe sea walls, and for the circulation of this notice by means of your far-reaching voice, throughout the wide world. At the period referred to in 1863 the moon happened to be any extreme south declination, and accordingly the greater devastation occurred in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g. Melbourne \u2013 vide The Times of Feb. 13 1864 \u2013 the Cape of Good Hope &c.), but next year the two hemispheres will be affected alike. I am quite aware that in taking this step I am allowing a sense of social duty to outweigh personal considerations; but I accept the consequences. \u2013 I have, &c., Dec. 21[4]"

        "content": "\"EQUINOCTAL GALES\" TO THE EDITOR Sir, \u2013 I owe every apology before again presumed in to seek a small space in your journal, but I am afraid the general popular attribution of the present serious gales to equinoctial causes may allow the seaman into a dangerous feeling of security when these gales leave us. We read long and painful lists of casualties from \"fearful gales,\" \"fierce jails,\" \"frightful hurricanes,\" &c., at Padstow, Falmouth, and Weymouth respectively; while a \"tale of unparalleled fury\" is described as felt at Weston-super-Mare and Boulogne, &c.\u00a0; so that passing occurrences, taken in connection with my warning of October 5 to 7, are sufficiently serious, if I have not (as some people seem to think I have) mistaken in the period of greatest danger altogether. I am sorry to say that they present of weather has nothing to do with the equinox\u00a0: these are not equinoctial gales; they are to come. The mere equinoxes has only power to cause a serious disturbance when it occurs in unison with luni-solar influences. We must remember the present prevailing succession of gales set in a few hours before my marked 6th to 10th inst. (we will say within bounds), more than a fortnight before the equinox actually takes place. Equinoctial gales are the effect of an equinox, which effect must, of course, be preceded by the cause. As well we might expect to hear the report of a gun a fortnight before it is fired, as to have equinoctial gales set in weeks before the sun crosses the equator, late p.m. on the 22nd inst. Letters to me from the coast manifest considerable anxiety as to October 5th to 7th. It is a high responsibility, but with my strong convictions, resulting from experience, what am I to do when asked whether I will endeavour, as much as in me lies, to prevent loss of life and property? Can I forget the lives I may in person have assisted to save? Can one ever forget his experiences when, on many occasions, forming one of a lifeboat's crew at the Goodwin? My suggestions have been thankfully received by those whose lives would soon be periled by disregard of warnings. Fishermen may be induced not to sail for the Dogger Bank without every precaution; pilots and those whose work lies in the English Channel are forewarned and will be forearmed; and, indeed, will be better prepared for the worst if you will kindly permit me, sir, to state again the reason why I expected extreme bad weather in October. It is still imperfectly understood by the multitude. I discovered some years since that neither the moon nor the sun ever crosses the earth's equator without causing atmospheric disturbance, and especially in the winter months. The disturbance is greatly intensified when the new moon in perigee happens at such periods. Now, the new moon was in perigee (that is to say, the moon was at the part of her orbit nearest to the earth and is a direct line with the sun), on the 6th instant, thus combining three powers of attraction of the two bodies. About 30 hours afterwards the moon crossed the equator, and hence arose the continuation of atmospheric disturbance (as it always does in similar cases) which often takes so long to subsided. The consequences of this disturbance are interchanges of air currents, to the disturbance of temperature, inducing condensation of vapor, resulting in partial vacuums, which the rushing in of air tends to equilibrate; hence we have in and from these, gales and showers of a strength and quantity perfectly inestimable, except from comparisons. Now between the two causes referred to and a third cause of disturbance there was, I say, an interval of about 30 hours; but in October next all three corresponding causes will occur within a space of seven hours \u2013 i.e. perigee on the 5th at 7 a.m., lunar equinox at noon, and new moon at 2 p.m.. So that even from these causes alone ought to expect in October increased disturbance; but this will furthermore be intensified by the circumstances of the sun's being nearer to us in October that it was on the 7th September by at least eight seconds of parallax, or about one quarter of his whole yearly change of distance. Therefore, one is justified in expecting (to say the least) quite as great an atmospheric disturbance early in October as we have had since 6th inst.; and I am sorry to say the same may be expected with equal uncertainty and intensity on the 1st to 3rd November next. The warnings apply to all parts of the world; effects may be felt more in some places that in others. It is painful to have to forebode evil; but better thus than to merit self-reproach under circumstances which might lead to permanent regrets. Could I save one life, it would be very cheaply purchased in making better known certain laws of nature. \u2013 I have the honor to be Sir, your obedient servant, Faversham, Sept. 14.[5]"

        "content": "Halifax, 30th September 1869 Gentlemen: My attention has been drawn to a letter of Capt. Saxby, R.N., to the Standard of London in which a remarkable atmospheric disturbance is predicted for the coming 5th of October, as the result of the relative positions of the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon, on that day.  It may be remembered that a similar prediction of weather likely to occur about the same period, based on similar reasoning, was given to the world some months ago, by an observer in one of the West Indian Islands. Other calculations from district sources point to like conclusions. I have been asked my opinion with regard to these forecasts; and would thus state it publicly, in the hope of doing some good. I believe that a heavy gale will be encountered here on Tuesday next, the 5th Oct., beginning perhaps on Monday night, possibly deferred as late this Tuesday night; but between those two periods it seems inevitable. At its greatest force the direction of the wind should be South West; having commenced at or near South.  Should Monday, the 4th, be a warm day for the season, an additional guarantee of the coming storm will be given. Roughly speaking, the warmer it may be on the 4th, the more violent will be the succeeding storm. Apart from the theory of the moon's attraction, as applied to meteorology, \u2013 which is disbelief by many \u2013 the experience of any careful observer teaches him to look for a storm at next new moon; and the state of the atmosphere, and consequent weather lately, appears to be leading directly not only to this blow next week, but to a succession of gales during next month.  Telegrams from points to the South West of us might give notice of the approach of this storm, and I trust this warning will not be unheeded.[6]"

        "content": "Tropical Depression Nineteen-E was a weak yet costly tropical cyclone that caused significant flooding throughout Northwestern Mexico and several states within the United States in September 2018. The storm was also the first known tropical cyclone to form over the Gulf of California. Nineteen-E originated from a tropical wave that left the west coast of Africa on August 29 to 30. It continued westward, crossed over Central America, and entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean by September 7. It then meandered to the southwest of Mexico for the next several days as it interacted with a mid-to-upper level trough. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) continued to track the disturbance for the next several days as it traveled northward. A surface trough developed over the Baja California peninsula on September 18. Despite disorganization and having close proximity to land, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression in the Gulf of California on September 19, after having developed a circulation center and more concentrated convection. The system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1002 mbar (29.59 inHg). One day after forming, the depression quickly deteriorated and dissipated after making landfall in Sonora. Overall, the depression affected eleven Mexican states, with torrential rainfall and flooding ensuing in Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, and Sonora. Thirteen individuals were killed in Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Sonora, and over $40 million USD in agricultural losses were recorded. Excessive rainfall led to the inundation of at least 300,000 structures in Sinaloa. Total flood damage in the state was $165.8 million (USD). Two children died in Sinaloa months after the storm as a result of unrepaired damage. Remnant moisture from Nineteen-E led to severe flooding within the U.S. states of Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas and the death of one person. Damage estimates totaled about $250 million (USD) in the aforementioned states. Minor damage was also reported in New Mexico."

        "content": "Tropical Depression Nineteen-E's origins can be traced back to a tropical wave that departed from the west coast of Africa between August 29 and 30. On August 31, it generated Tropical Depression Six, which would later become Hurricane Florence.[1] The wave continued to track westward at low latitudes, leaving Florence behind in the far eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. The wave eventually moved over Central America and crossed into the far northeastern Pacific Ocean by September 7. The wave then slowed down and leisurely moved westward, south of Mexico for the next week or so. Meanwhile, a mid-level shortwave trough dropped southward from the United States, entering Mexico on September 9. The trough continued to track southward for the next few days and a low- to mid-level low developed just south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula on September 12.[1] Around that time, the NHC noted the system had the potential for future tropical development.[2] The low moved southwestward for the next several days. The trough and a plume of moisture rushed northward towards the Baja California peninsula just as the tropical wave was arriving. An area of low pressure formed several hundred miles south of the southern coast of Mexico on September 14 at 12:00 UTC.[3] A surface trough with a north-to-south orientation developed over Baja California Sur on September 18 with thunderstorms having developed from the deep tropics to the Gulf of California.[4][1] The disturbance moved into the Gulf of California on September 19.[5] A circulation center and more concentrated convection formed along the trough. Despite stronger wind shear and its proximity to land, the disturbance consolidated into a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC. The genesis of Nineteen-E was unexpected, having occurred after the NHC had downgraded the 5-day formation chance to low. The NHC stated that Nineteen-E was the first tropical cyclone to have formed over the Gulf of California based on records dating back to 1949.[1] Six hours later, the depression's maximum sustained winds peaked at 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h).[1] Around that time, the NHC noted that banding features had become slightly more defined and an area of strong convection was present in the eastern semicircle.[6] At 00:00 UTC on September 20, the depression's minimum central pressure decreased to 1002 mbar (29.59 inHg). Around 03:00 UTC, Nineteen-E made landfall between the cities of Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n and Guaymas in Sonora.[1] After moving ashore, the rugged terrain of Sonora quickly weakened the depression. Six hours after landfall, the NHC noted that the depression's convection had taken on a more linear look and that it had lost its closed surface circulation.[7] The NHC reported that Nineteen-E dissipated around 12:00 UTC that day.[1] Nineteen-E's remnants continued to travel northward, while causing severe flooding in Mexico. After entering the United States, the remnants tracked eastward and drew in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, causing flash flooding in several states.[8]"

        "content": "Tropical Depression Nineteen-E caused flooding throughout northwestern Mexico. In total, at least eleven Mexican states were affected by the depression, with Baja California Sur, Sonora, and Sinaloa being impacted the hardest.[10] Torrential rainfall affected the Baja California peninsula for a few days before genesis occurred on September 19 through the system's dissipation.[11] The National Meteorological Service of Mexico reported that Baja California Sur received heavy rainfall, with totals of approximately \n3\u20134\u00a0in (70\u2013100\u00a0mm) and an isolated value of up to 4.88\u00a0in (124\u00a0mm) being reported in the southern portion of the state.[9] The cyclone's quick formation over the Gulf of California, which was attributed to warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures, left insufficient time for warnings to be issued for municipalities.[12] On September 19, in anticipation of hazardous effects from Nineteen-E, a green alert was issued off-shore of Mexico.[13] On September 20, the depression made landfall in Sonora, Mexico.[7] The torrential rains associated with the depression were the most intense to impact the state in the last decade. According to Conagua, the National Water Commission, over  8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of rain fell in a 10-hour period in some locations.[14][15] While most of the rainfall in Sonora came from Nineteen-E, sporadic bursts of convection unaffiliated with the depression contributed additional rainfall.[16] At least 13 municipalities in Sinaloa received heavy rainfall, with a total of 5.5\u00a0in (140\u00a0mm) being recorded at El Cazanate.[1] In the municipality of Nogales, more than 300 tonnes of mud, stones, and garbage were removed from roads in order to make them passable for vehicles.[17] Additionally, two bodies were recovered by Nogales police after having been dragged across the border, into Arizona, by strong currents.[18] Over 100 people were rescued from floods and the total number affected is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.[19] Traffic on Federal Highway 15 in southern Sonora was interrupted as strong water currents flowed across the road. Authorities used social media to alert the public to stay off the highway. Additionally, 30 people were rescued from a passenger bus that had gotten stuck between streams.[20] In Sinaloa, record-breaking rainfall of 98\u00a0US\u00a0gal (370\u00a0L) per 11\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (1\u00a0m2) was reported in Culiac\u00e1n, exceeding the amount the state had received from Hurricane Manuel in 2013.[21][22] One person was killed in the community of Goritos where 14.150\u00a0in (359.41\u00a0mm) of rain fell.[1][23] In Culiac\u00e1n, a total of six deaths occurred. One person drowned after heavy rainfall occurred.[24] Additionally, three women were swept away by floodwaters from the El Piojo stream; two bodies were later recovered.[25] Two indirect deaths occurred from electrocution.[26][27] Classes at all levels of education were cancelled in several municipalities as a result of the flooding.[20][17] Many roads were damaged, with sinkholes appearing on Federal Highway 15.[19] A bridge collapsed in Ahome, forcing the closure of a road.[28] More than 16,000 people were evacuated and 13 shelters were set up due to severe flooding.[26][11] Following the deluge of rainfall, the Culiac\u00e1n River Derivative Dam overflowed.[29] The Eustaquio Buelna dam filled to more than 144 percent of its capacity.[28] A freight train derailed while traveling from Retes Station to Techa in Mocorito.[30] The Cahuinahua canal overflowed in the municipality of El Fuerte, flooding several communities.[31] Damage to agriculture exceeded 800 million pesos ($41 million USD) in Sinaloa after 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) of agricultural fields and hydro-agricultural infrastructure were inundated.[1] In total, over 500,000 birds and 15,000 heads of cattle, goats, and pigs were killed and swept away by the currents of engorged rivers. As a result, approximately 58,000 jobs were impacted.[32] Over 300,000 structures were inundated in Sinaloa, including 160 schools; in the coastal city of Los Mochis, 70,000 buildings were damaged.[33] The National Center for Disaster Prevention reported that total flood damage in Sinaloa was over 3.182 billion pesos ($165.8 million USD).[34][35] At least 791.8 million pesos ($41.2 million USD) in losses occurred in the economic sector and 754.9 million pesos ($39.3 million USD) in losses occurred in the communications and transportation sector. Around 48.4 percent of the total was damage and losses in education, health, housing, hydraulic systems, and sports and cultural attractions. Over 2.2 million pesos ($114,000 USD) in damage and losses occurred to public infrastructure.[35] In the state of Chihuahua, three people were reported dead. A 51-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman drowned in the municipality of Satev\u00f3 after being dragged by strong currents. In Namiquipa, the body of a 45-year-old man was recovered after he drowned while attempting to cross an engorged stream.[10][19][27] Rainfall in the southwestern portion of the state was 2.0\u20133.9\u00a0in (50\u201399\u00a0mm), with a small region reporting up to 7.83\u00a0in (199\u00a0mm).[9] In Guanajuato, heavy rainfall forced the reopening of floodgates at the Ignacio Allende Dam.[20]"

Approximately 2\u20133\u00a0in (50\u201380\u00a0mm) of rain fell near Sahuarita, causing washes of up to 2\u00a0ft (0.6\u00a0m) that left several individuals stranded in their vehicles.[38] In Thatcher, 1.5\u20132.5\u00a0in (38\u201363\u00a0mm) of rain fell, causing two homes to flood. Additionally, multiple roads flooded after a drainage canal overflowed. Several dorm rooms at Eastern Arizona College flooded, along with several apartments in the area.[39][40] Near Silverbell, 3\u00a0ft (0.9\u00a0m) of water ran over the intersection of two roads.[41] Near Vicksburg, severe rain caused flash flooding, resulting in road closures near Interstate 10.[42] It was also reported that 1.56\u00a0in (39.6\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Tucson,[39] where a person walking near the Pantano Wash was rescued after being overcome by rising waters.[40] In New Mexico, it was reported that a large cottonwood tree blew down near the Kirtland Air Force Base after winds of 50 knots (58\u00a0mph; 93\u00a0km/h) occurred. Damage was reported at approximately $1,000 (USD).[43] The National Weather Service stated that no other damage had been reported for New Mexico. In Albuquerque a peak rainfall total of 1.40\u00a0in (35.6\u00a0mm) was reported.[37] In Texas, Nineteen-E brought torrential rains that caused significant flooding in many areas. In Everman, a suburb of Fort Worth, water was reportedly up to 6\u00a0ft (2\u00a0m) deep in places. Over 60 homes were inundated, which forced many people to evacuate.[44] On September 23, the body of a 23-year-old was recovered from a creek in Fort Worth.[45] 14 people had to be rescued from broken-down cars in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.[46] Near Austin, 61 people from a wedding venue had to be rescued by firefighters. Additionally, the Shady River RV Resort off of State Highway 29 and near Interstate 35 was evacuated.[47] In Arlington, a 23-year-old man drowned after being swept off a bridge. At Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, over 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of rain fell. In Dallas, 15 people, including five police officers, were rescued from rising waters. Additionally, in Killeen, 34 patients were evacuated from the Metroplex Hospital after a lightning strike knocked out power to the facility.[48] Several roads in Nolan,[49] Jones,[50] Tom Green,[51] Uvalde, Rockwall, Fannin,[46] Sutton, and Schleicher Counties were closed due to flooding and damage.[52] Near Farmersville, high water along a railway bridge led to a train derailment. While no one was injured, numerous freight train cars went off the rails.[46] In Electra, water up to 1\u00a0ft (0.3\u00a0m) deep was flowing over multiple city streets.[53] In Knox City, a vehicle stalled after its driver attempted to drive through flood waters.[54] Additionally, Sonora was hit with a 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m) wall of water after the spillways to several dams were activated. Water flooded all access points to the town, preventing first responders from entering. Over 250 homes in the village were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters.[55] In Oklahoma, Nineteen-E caused widespread flooding after dropping large amounts of rain. The highest recorded rainfall total in far northern Johnston County was approximately 15.81\u00a0in (401.6\u00a0mm).[8] In Pontotoc County, four water rescues were conducted and a state of emergency was declared as rainfall and flooding associated with Nineteen-E made many roads near the city of Ada impossible to navigate. In Fittstown and Stonewall, some roads were washed out.[8] In a 12-hour period, 12.44\u00a0in (316.0\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Fittstown; this was the most rainfall recorded in a 12-hour span since the Oklahoma Mesonet was founded in 1990.[56] In total, 10 roads in the county were closed due to being washed out; the cost to repair these roads was estimated at $350,000 (USD).[57] Additionally, roads in several other counties were closed and/or washed out as a result of severe flooding, including U.S. 77.[58][59] In Arkansas, Nineteen-E caused flash flooding that resulted in the closure of several roads. The Northeast Arkansas District Fair in Jonesboro was cancelled due to the anticipation of severe flooding.[60] Nearly 7\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Searcy County and White County. The flash flooding that occurred because of this rainfall closed several roadways. First responders helped to free vehicles that were stalled in the water and placed barricades in areas affected by the flooding.[61]"

In Sinaloa, the extent and severity of the flooding was conveyed by the public through the use of social media platforms.[62] On September 27, the municipalities of Ahome, Culiac\u00e1n, Angostura, Badiraguato, Choix, Guasave, El Fuerte, Mocorito, Sinaloa, Salvador Alvarado, and Navolato were all declared disaster areas by the Government of Mexico.[63][32] In Culiac\u00e1n, the Autonomous University of the West and part of the Autonomous University of Sinaloa were designated as temporary shelters for people affected by the depression.[14] After the extent of the flooding became known, the Marine Plan was activated for Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora and Sinaloa to help victims of the floods.[11] Moreover, the Mexican Army initiated the DN-3 plan for natural disasters and deployed some 2,000 soldiers in Sinaloa and Sonora to aid in relief efforts.[64][62] In Sinaloa, four aircraft were sent to assist in cleanup efforts, three search and rescue teams were deployed, and two helicopters were used to transport supplies to flood victims. Additionally, 17 helicopters were sent to perform reconnaissance in Sonora and transport supplies.[64] The governor of Sinaloa, Quirino Ordaz Coppel, encouraged citizens to contribute food, water, and clothing in order to assist with the relief effort.[23] Several days later, the National Fund for Natural Disasters (Fonden) was activated to assist local and regional governments in responding to the flooding.[65] Additionally, the Macrosimulacro 2018, a nationwide disaster evacuation drill,[66] was suspended as a precautionary measure in Sonora and Baja California Sur.[67] In the latter state, safety devices were implemented to prevent people from crossing swollen streams.[20] The Sinaloa Ministry of Social Development (Sedesol) faced lawsuits after delivering old, diaper-filled mattresses to victims of the storm.[68] The administrative coordinator for Sedesol, Carlos Castro Olivas, was arrested on October 18, 2018, and charged with the crimes of illegal negotiations to the detriment of public service and society and embezzlement in connection with the distribution of rotten mattresses following Nineteen-E.[69] Carlos Castro Olivas was acquitted on December 17, 2020, as a result of a lack of evidence after two key witnesses for the prosecution failed to appear in court.[70][71] Diego Maradona, then coach of the Dorados de Sinaloa, hosted a charity dinner on November\u00a05 to provide financial support for individuals affected by Hurricane Willa and Nineteen-E.[72] Fonden announced in 2019 that it would provide $33 million pesos (US$1.5 million) to support reconstruction in Culiac\u00e1n. Over 1.812 billion pesos (US$92.2 million) in relief had been authorized for areas affected by flooding, however, the location of the money is unknown.[73] During 2019, officials worked to repair damaged bridges on Federal Highway 15.[28][74] Two children lost their lives in Culiac\u00e1n as a result of damage inflicted to a storm sewer by Nineteen-E. The first child, a 9-year-old boy, died after falling into a sinkhole in December 2018 while trying to avoid the damaged sewer. The second child, a 17-year-old girl, was killed after having been swept through a 4.9\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m)-wide hole in the sewer. Municipal officials repaired the damage in September 2019.[75] President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador approved a request in February 2019 to improve hydraulic flood-prevention systems in the municipalities of Culiac\u00e1n and Ahome.[76] The Sinaloa state government launched a 1.3 billion peso ($67.6 million USD)-economic recovery package. Nearly a year after the storm, the government provided 500 million pesos ($26 million USD) in funds to improve hydraulic flood-prevention systems in Ahome.[77] From 2019\u201320, the state government built an underground water storage system to drain excess water from the El Piojo stream to prevent future severe flooding.[78] Flood drainage pipes were installed in El Carrizo to prevent future flood events.[79] The National Commission for Aquaculture and Fisheries provided funds for the dredging of a dock and two water channels in the Santa Mar\u00eda Bay, Angostura, Sinaloa, to alleviate the effects of Nineteen-E on the environment. The work was expected to remove 7,970,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft (225,700\u00a0m3) of silt and benefit 2,000 fishermen.[80]"

On September 28, Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for Ellis, Sutton, Tarrant,[81] Fannin, and Uvalde Counties in response to widespread and severe property damage caused by the floods.[82] On February 25, 2019, President Donald Trump declared a number of counties, including the counties impacted by the remnants of Nineteen-E from September 20\u201321,[82] a major disaster area after a series of storms impacted the state from September through November.[83] In Sutton County, the Bank & Trust and the San Angelo Area Foundation set up relief funds for Sonora.[84] Additionally, the San Angelo Health Foundation donated a total of $250,000 (USD) to the Sonora Flood Relief Fund for flood damage that occurred on September 21. Combined with over 450 other donations and grants, the relief fund reached a total of approximately $750,000 (USD).[85] Lions Clubs International and other private organizations and charities also donated supplies and money to the relief effort. Various state agencies evaluated damage to infrastructure and provided funding for repairs as well.[86] Moreover, Texas musicians scheduled multiple concerts in order to raise funds for flood relief in Sonora.[87] A few days after the floods, American Red Cross representatives arrived to help aid the recovery efforts.[88] In Tarrant County, it was reported that various relief organizations were attempting to help with cleanup and recovery efforts within the Fort Worth suburb of Everman.[89] The city set up a disaster relief station to provide assistance to displaced residents on September 22.[90]"

        "content": "Hurricane Rick was the third-most intense Pacific hurricane on record and the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2009, only behind Typhoon Nida. Developing off the southern coast of Mexico on October\u00a015, Rick traversed an area with favorable environmental conditions, favoring rapid intensification, allowing it to become a hurricane within 24 hours of being declared a tropical depression. An eye began to form during the afternoon of October\u00a016; once fully formed, the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening. During the afternoon of October\u00a017, the storm attained Category\u00a05 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Several hours later, Rick attained its peak intensity as the third-strongest Pacific hurricane on record with winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 906 mbar (hPa; 26.75\u00a0inHg). After maintaining this intensity for several hours, Rick began to weaken in response to a combination of an eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear. By October\u00a019, the storm was downgraded to a Category\u00a03 hurricane and the following day to a tropical storm. The long-anticipated northeast turn took place near the end of this phase, also accompanied by a brief decrease in forward motion. On October\u00a021, Rick quickly moved northeast, brushing the tip of Baja California Sur before making landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h; 52\u00a0kn). Several hours after moving inland, the final advisory from the NHC was issued as the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated. Prior to landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initially forecast Rick to make landfall in southern Baja California as a high-end Category\u00a02 hurricane, prompting hurricane watches. Officials ordered several hundred residents to evacuate from low-lying areas, although tropical storm warnings replaced the hurricane watches after the storm had weakened. Overall, the damage from Rick was significantly less than initially anticipated. In Mexico, three people were killed by the storm, one in Oaxaca and two in Baja California Sur."

        "content": "Hurricane Rick originated from a strong tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on October 3, 2009. Convective activity was initially sparse as the system tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. By October\u00a08, an area of low pressure developed within the disturbance wave and convection increased. The low eventually moved over South America and dissipated on October\u00a011. The wave, however, remained well-defined and continued westward, entering the Pacific Ocean on October\u00a012.[1] By the morning of October\u00a015, the wave began to regain convection and eventually spawned a new area of low pressure roughly 475\u00a0mi (764\u00a0km; 413\u00a0nmi) south-southwest of Puerto \u00c1ngel, Mexico.[2] By the afternoon, the NHC reported that the system had become increasingly organized and was likely to develop into a tropical depression later that day.[3] Around 11:00\u00a0am PDT (1800\u00a0UTC), the NHC declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression, the 20th of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season.[1][4] The storm featured well-developed outflow in all directions. Environmental conditions consisting of low wind shear, high moisture content and above average sea surface temperatures in the path of the system were exceptionally favorable for rapid development. Additionally, the storm was being steered through this region by a low- to mid-level ridge over Mexico.[5] Six hours after being declared a depression, the system quickly intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Rick.[6] Deep convection, an early indication of an eye forming, had begun wrapping around the center of the system.[7] Early on October\u00a016, a ragged eyewall began to develop and several hours later,[8] Rick intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[9] The rapid intensification was fueled by waters of 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), several degrees above average.[1][10] By the evening of October\u00a016, microwave satellite imagery depicted a well-defined eye; however, this feature was not present on infrared images. Despite this, the NHC upgraded Rick to a Category\u00a02 hurricane with winds now reaching 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[11] Early the next morning, the storm intensified into a major hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale. The eye was clearly visible on satellite images and deep, very cold convection surrounded it, signifying a powerful cyclone.[12] Less than 40 minutes after this upgrade, the NHC issued a special advisory stating that Rick had further strengthened into a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[13] Continuing to gain strength, Rick attained winds of 145\u00a0mph (235\u00a0km/h) several hours later on October\u00a017. A possible outer eyewall, a second eye larger than the first that often forms at the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle, was noted at this time.[14] The eye of the storm became very well-defined and nearly cloud free, measuring roughly 11.5\u00a0mi (18.5\u00a0km; 10.0\u00a0nmi) in diameter. In addition to the rapid intensification, Rick was also growing in size.[15] By the afternoon hours, tropical storm-force winds extended up to 155\u00a0mi (249\u00a0km; 135\u00a0nmi) from the center of the storm, with a maximum gale diameter of 300\u00a0mi (483\u00a0km; 261\u00a0nmi).[16] At 3:10\u00a0pm PDT (2210\u00a0UTC), the NHC issued its second special advisory for Rick, this time stating that the storm had become a Category\u00a05 hurricane, the first in the basin since Hurricane Kenna in 2002.[17][18] Around 8:00\u00a0pm PDT (0300\u00a0UTC on October\u00a018), Rick attained its peak intensity as the third-strongest Pacific hurricane on record. Maximum sustained winds in the eyewall reached an estimated 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) and the barometric pressure is estimated to have bottomed out at 906\u00a0mbar (906.00\u00a0hPa; 26.75\u00a0inHg). The pressure was not directly measured by Hurricane Hunter aircraft because the storm was too far from land at the time. Lixion Avila, a senior hurricane specialist at the NHC, described Rick's satellite presentation at this time as \"spectacular.\"[19] Rick maintained its peak intensity for roughly two hours between 7:00\u00a0pm and 9:00\u00a0pm PDT (0200 and 0400 UTC) on October\u00a017, before it began to weaken in response to an eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear.[20] Throughout the day, deep convection around the eye warmed slightly and a combination of dry air and wind shear restrained the extent of the storms' outflow to the west. The combination of these factors imparted steady weakening.[21] Later that day, Rick began to turn towards the northwest as the subtropical ridge north of the system began to weaken.[22] Early on October\u00a019, Rick degraded to a Category\u00a03 hurricane as it began its approach to the southern end of the Baja California peninsula.[23] Wind shear and dry air quickly entered the core of the system, with the eye disappearing from satellite imagery later that morning.[1][24] During the evening of October\u00a019, the center of Rick became devoid of convective activity, resulting in the NHC downgrading it to a tropical storm. According to meteorologists at the NHC, the weakening was \"...almost as fast as it strengthened several days ago.\"[25] The first Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the storm took place during the afternoon of October\u00a020. During the mission, sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h; 56\u00a0kn) and a surface pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (990.00\u00a0hPa; 29.23\u00a0inHg) were recorded.[26] Several hours after this, convection rapidly increased, with a large area of deep convection developing northeast of the center of circulation; however, this was not associated with intensification.[27] Around 7:00\u00a0am PDT (1400\u00a0UTC) on October\u00a021. Tropical Storm Rick made landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[1][28] Following landfall, the storm rapidly weakened to a tropical depression[29] and roughly seven hours after moving inland, the surface circulation of Rick dissipated over the high terrain of Mexico.[30]"

Residents were advised of potentially heavy rainfall.[31] Along coastal areas of Mexico, specifically around Acapulco, officials closed ports to small crafts due to rough seas.[32] Residents around the city were also warned about the possibility of mudslides from heavy rain associated with the cyclone's outer bands.[33] Upon Rick's intensification to a Category\u00a04 hurricane, officials in Mexico raised the alert level in Guerrero, Jalisco and Michoac\u00e1n to severe.[34] In Sonora, the local government placed 14 municipalities under a blue alert, the pre-storm phase;[35] the alert was upgraded to a yellow alert for the municipalities of \u00c1lamos, Benito Ju\u00e1rez, Navojoa, Etchojoa and Huatabampo on October 18.[36] Early on October\u00a019, the Government of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for areas of Baja California Sur between Santa Fe and San Evaristo.[1] Following the issuance of the watch, authorities in the region began planning to open shelters and begin evacuating residents from low-lying areas.[37] Later that day, the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning as Rick weakened to a tropical storm. By October\u00a020, a new tropical storm watch was issued for mainland Mexico for areas between El Roblito and Altata.[1] Shortly after, officials had opened nine shelters in the region; however, schools remained open until further notice.[38] Later in the day, the tropical storm warning for Baja California was discontinued while the watch for mainland Mexico was upgraded to a warning. This warning was later discontinued on October\u00a021 as Rick dissipated over the mountains of Mexico.[1] Several cruises were affected by the storm throughout southern Baja California. The Carnival Splendor made a sudden docking as the storm formed and delayed its arrival in Cabo San Lucas by several days.  The Carnival Spirit, scheduled to dock in Acapulco on October\u00a021, delayed its arrival until October\u00a022. The Sapphire Princess rescheduled its course, remaining near San Francisco, California, for several additional days instead of traveling south. The Norwegian Star skipped its planned docking in Cabo San Lucas and remained at sea until the passage of Rick. Other cruises affected by the storm include Radiance of the Seas, Mariner of the Seas, MS Veendam and MS Statendam.[39]"

Two of the passengers were rescued; however, the third was found dead.[42] Large swells killed one person along the southern end of Baja California Sur on October\u00a019.[43] Another fatality took place in the same region after a boy was swept away from an eroded beach.[44] Roughly 320 people near Cabo San Lucas were evacuated due to the threat of flooding. Reports near the city also indicated that there was structural damage and significant traffic issues from rain-induced mudslides.[45] In Mazatl\u00e1n, near where Rick made landfall, high winds downed trees and signs, leaving numerous residents without power. Heavy rain was also reported during the passage of the storm.[46] Throughout Mexico, damage from Rick amounted to 192\u00a0million pesos ($14.6\u00a0million USD).[47] On December\u00a029, the Government of Mexico allocated 381\u00a0million pesos (US$29.6\u00a0million) to assist in recovery from both Hurricanes Jimena and Rick.[48]"

Severe thunderstorms occurred over parts of the southern states, with at least three tornadoes touching down in Louisiana. Further north, the complex brought heavy rainfall to the northeast and parts of southern Canada. In Louisiana, the storm system spawned seven tornadoes, two of which were ranked as EF-1.[49] One of these tornadoes damaged more than 10\u00a0structures, destroyed a grain silo, flipped a tractor trailer and left numerous residents without power.[50] In all, the tornadoes left nearly $1\u00a0million in losses and injured one person.[49] In Texas, the remnants of Rick produced torrential rainfall, peaking at 9.34\u00a0in (237\u00a0mm) within a concentrated area. Meteorologists did not anticipate the severity of the precipitation in this area.[51] One person was killed after being swept away in her Jeep on a flooded roadway. Several homes were also flooded during the event and an estimated 300 homes were left without power. Following the floods, numerous roads were closed and some schools had delayed openings.[51] Throughout the state, flood damage amounted to $690,000, with most of this being in Travis County.[49] Heavy rainfall in Louisiana contributed to widespread flooding that resulted in the closure of several major highways.[52] In Union Parish, rainfall exceeding 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) led to flash flooding that inundated several homes and a local school, inflicting over $100,000 in damage.[53]"

        "content": "On October\u00a017, Hurricane Rick was classified a Category\u00a05 hurricane, becoming the first in the eastern Pacific basin since Hurricane Kenna in 2002 and the first east of the International Date Line since Hurricane Ioke in 2006.[17] The storm also became the thirteenth cyclone of this intensity east of the International Date Line since official records in the Eastern Pacific began in 1949.[18] Shortly after being upgraded to Category\u00a05 status, Rick attained its peak intensity with winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h; 156\u00a0kn) and a barometric pressure of 906\u00a0mbar (906.00\u00a0hPa; 26.75\u00a0inHg),[55] making it the second-strongest hurricane ever recorded in the East Pacific, surpassing Kenna. Only Hurricane Linda of 1997 was stronger than Rick, with minimum pressure of 902\u00a0mbar (902\u00a0hPa; 26.6\u00a0inHg).[18] Hurricane Patricia in 2015 later far surpassed both Rick and Linda, attaining a pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75\u00a0inHg).[56] It also became the second storm in the basin to have sustained winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h; 156\u00a0kn) or higher, the first being Linda with 185\u00a0mph (298\u00a0km/h; 161\u00a0kn) winds.[18][55] Patricia surpassed both with 215\u00a0mph (346\u00a0km/h; 187\u00a0kn) winds. Upon being declared a tropical depression on October\u00a015, computer forecasting models already anticipated the likelihood of rapid intensification due to the unusually favorable environmental conditions ahead of the system. The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF) showed the storm attaining a minimum pressure below 900 mbar (hPa; 26.58\u00a0inHg),[5] an intensity not attained by any Eastern Pacific hurricane on record at the time.[18] The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) rapid intensification index, a storm's probability of intensifying by 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h; 30\u00a0kn) or more within 24\u00a0hours, was set at 60%.[5] This percentage quickly increased to 82% several hours later, 11 times higher than the sample mean. The official forecast from the NHC by their second advisory stated that Rick would become a Category\u00a04 hurricane by October\u00a019; however, they mentioned that due to the favorable environment, the storm could intensify faster than forecast.[7] Once Rick had become a Category\u00a02 storm on October\u00a016, the NHC increased their forecast peak intensity to 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h; 126\u00a0kn), a mid-range Category\u00a04 hurricane.[11] The first mention of Rick possibly becoming a Category\u00a05 hurricane was in the seventh discussion released by the NHC on October\u00a017. In their advisory, it was noted that the storm had a 10% chance of reaching this intensity within 36\u00a0hours.[12] Several hours after this advisory was released, a special update advisory was issued. This new advisory placed the peak intensity of Rick just below Category\u00a05 status, with maximum winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h; 135\u00a0kn).[57] It was not until the late morning hours of October\u00a017 that the NHC officially anticipated the storm to attain Category\u00a05 status.[14] Upon attaining winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h; 156\u00a0kn), Rick was forecast to peak with winds of 185\u00a0mph (298\u00a0km/h; 161\u00a0kn), which would have tied the record (at the time) intensity set by Hurricane Linda.[18][19]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Vicente was an unusually small tropical cyclone that made landfall as a tropical depression in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n on October 23, 2018, causing deadly mudslides. The 21st named storm of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Vicente originated from a tropical wave that departed from Africa's western coast on October 6. The wave traveled westward across the Atlantic and entered the Eastern Pacific on October 17. The disturbance became better defined over the next couple of days, forming into a tropical depression early on October 19. Located in an environment favorable for further development, the system organized into Tropical Storm Vicente later that day. The small cyclone traveled northwestward along the Guatemalan coast before later shifting to a more westerly track. Vicente peaked late on October 20 with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,002\u00a0mbar (29.59\u00a0inHg). At its peak, Vicente displayed a sporadic eye feature in its central dense overcast. The storm maintained this intensity for about eighteen hours as it turned towards the southwest. Dry air caused Vicente to weaken on October 21. A brief break from the dry air during the next day allowed the storm to recuperate and slightly strengthen. However, outflow from the nearby Hurricane Willa caused Vicente to weaken into a tropical depression early on October 23. After making landfall near Playa Azul at 13:30 UTC, Vicente quickly lost organization and dissipated a few hours later. Vicente caused torrential rainfall in the Mexican states of Michoac\u00e1n, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Guerrero, and Colima; the highest total exceeded 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) in Oaxaca. In some states, the effects of Vicente compounded those from the nearby Hurricane Willa. The storm left a total of 16 people dead throughout 2 states: 13 in Oaxaca and 3 in Veracruz. The heavy rainfall caused numerous rivers to spill their banks, dozens of landslides to occur, and severe flooding to ensue elsewhere. This resulted in hundreds of homes being inundated, dozens of road closures, and agricultural damage amongst an array of other effects. Plan DN-III-E was activated in multiple states to provide aid to affected individuals. The federal and state governments mobilized to help with relief efforts and repairs."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Tropical Storm Vicente's origins can be traced back to a low-level vortex associated with the eastern Pacific monsoon trough and a tropical wave. The wave departed from Africa's western coast on October 6 and traveled westward across the Atlantic Ocean, arriving at the Lesser Antilles around October\u00a014. Although convection or thunderstorm activity initially flared along the northern side of the wave, it gradually decreased until the wave was completely devoid of convection. The wave came into contact with Central America on October\u00a016; deep convection re-ignited along the monsoon trough and wave south of Panama a day later. Bursts of convection occurred to the south of Nicaragua and El Salvador as the wave proceeded westward into the Eastern Pacific.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned that the system had the potential for tropical development early on October\u00a019. The system was part of a broader disturbance which stretched from Central America to the south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.[2] Over the next several hours the system rapidly organized, becoming a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC, while located about 90\u00a0mi (150\u00a0km) west-southwest of Puerto San Jose, Guatemala. The depression's development was not anticipated due to its small size and the close proximity of a larger disturbance to the west (which later become Hurricane Willa).[1] The nascent depression was located in an environment of low wind shear and warm 82\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C) sea surface temperatures, both conducive for further intensification.[3] The structure of the unusually small storm continued to improve, with satellite and microwave imagery showing an increase in banding features around the center. The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Vicente around 18:00\u00a0UTC. Throughout the majority of October\u00a019, the system was less than 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) off the coast of Guatemala while it inched towards the northwest.[1] Early on October\u00a020, increasing northwesterly wind shear disrupted Vicente, causing the degradation of its central dense overcast. At the same time, its low-level center had accelerated towards the northwest and was almost entirely exposed.[4] A deep-layer ridge located over the Gulf of Mexico and central Mexico, as well as a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind, caused Vicente's track to shift to the west during the overnight.[1] The tiny tropical cyclone's structure improved over the next several hours, with the storm displaying a sporadic eye feature surrounded by medium to weak convection.[5] Vicente peaked at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a020 with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1,002\u00a0mbar (29.59\u00a0inHg). At that time, the storm was located less than 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) off the coast of Chiapas and Oaxaca, Mexico. Vicente was an unusually small tropical cyclone, with 45\u201350\u00a0mph (70\u201380\u00a0km/h) winds extending only 25\u00a0mi (35\u00a0km) from its center. The system maintained its peak intensity for approximately 18\u00a0hours as it began traveling towards the west-southwest.[1][6] Dry air began to entrain into the mid-levels of the system on October\u00a021, causing convection to weaken and the low-level center to become uncovered once more.[1][7] The storm turned to the west-northwest early on October 22 as it rounded the southwestern edge of the aforementioned ridge. The structure of Vicente markedly improved while it experienced a brief reprieve from the onslaught of the dry air; a banding feature with cold cloud tops of \u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221280\u00a0\u00b0C) developed and wrapped around a majority of the storm.[1][8] Later in the day, Vicente began to be affected by the outflow of Hurricane Willa, which was located to the northwest. This outflow imparted northeasterly shear upon Vicente, causing rapid degradation of the system's structure. Banding features decreased significantly and only limited convection remained, displaced to the south and east of Vicente's center.[1][9] Vicente weakened into a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a023 and made landfall near Playa Azul, Michoac\u00e1n, at 13:30\u00a0UTC. After moving ashore, Vicente quickly lost its convection and dissipated by 18:00 UTC.[1][10]"

These included a large landslip in 1925, which caused many deaths, as well as large but relatively undamaging landslides in 1941, 1950 and 1966.[1] Most of these had been caused by heavy rainstorms, in a similar manner to the 1972 landslides. Shiu Fai Terrace, another site of landslips, had been leased in 1920 and the number and height of buildings that could be built on it had been restricted, probably decreasing the death toll of the 1972 disasters. On 18 June, to cope with the disasters, all British Forces in the colony were mobilised, all police and fire services leave was cancelled, and the Civil Aid Service and Auxiliary Medical Services were called to assist in rescue operations.[3]"

Po Shan Road was cordoned off to the public and nearby apartments were evacuated as it quickly became apparent that a large landslide would soon occur.[1] A little after 5 p.m. that day, a huge mass of rocks, mud and vegetation suddenly broke free and slid down the side of IL 2260, breaking through a retaining wall on Kotewall Road and completely blocking Conduit Road. There were no deaths directly resulting from this slip, however.[1] Then, some time after 8 p.m., an even larger landslip occurred starting at IL 2260 and, in less than ten seconds, cleared a path from Po Shan Road to Kotewall Road, destroying several houses and retaining walls in the process. Upon hitting Kotewall Road, the slip knocked Kotewall Court (the only well-lit building in the area at the time) completely off of its foundation and collapsed several flats at Robinson Road and Babington Path.[1][6] 67 people were killed and 20 were injured in less than a minute[1] Because of the lack of lighting and the rain, as well as the fact that much of the transportation network had been destroyed, rescue efforts were initially sporadic and hampered.[1] Some landslips continued to occur, causing withdrawals of emergency personnel. More than an hour had passed when the first survivors were pulled from the rubble, at 9:24.[1] Eventually, however, most known survivors had been rescued in the next several days.[1]"

The fifth tropical cyclone and named storm of the annual hurricane season, Earl developed on August\u00a013 from a tropical wave centered well east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression gradually organized as it tracked west-northwestward and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl roughly a day after genesis. As the system approached the Windward Islands it continued to slowly strengthen, peaking as a 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) tropical storm early on August\u00a015. However, the system unexpectedly degenerated into a tropical wave that afternoon, likely due to its fast forward motion. The remnants of Earl continued across the Caribbean Sea and eventually re-developed into Hurricane Frank in the eastern Pacific Ocean on August\u00a023. Gusty winds in Grenada damaged at least 34 roofs and knocked down twelve trees and six electrical poles. Additionally, a nursing home on the island was evacuated due to significant structural damage. Two houses lost their roofs in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, while moderate crop damage was reported on the island. Downed trees and power lines in Tobago left 90% of the island without electricity. Overall, Earl was responsible for one fatality, nineteen missing, and an unknown amount of damage."

        "content": "The formation of Tropical Storm Earl is attributed to a low-latitude, vigorous tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August\u00a010. As the disturbance moved towards the west, satellite imagery revealed a much better structure with much-improved banding features and fair upper-level outflow,[1] leading to the formation of Tropical Depression Five at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a013, situated roughly 1000\u00a0mi (1610\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression progressed rapidly towards the west-northwest the following day, embedded and under the influence of a deep easterly flow around the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the cyclone's north.[2] A combination of improved banding features and satellite intensity estimates by the afternoon of August\u00a014 led to the subsequent upgrade of the system to Tropical Storm Earl. At this time, the cyclone was situated about 325\u00a0mi (525\u00a0km/h) east of Barbados.[3] Within an environment characterized by low wind shear, high atmospheric humidity, and warm sea surface temperatures, Earl intensified, reaching a peak intensity of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) by 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015. Initial forecasts from the National Hurricane Center depicted gradual intensification into a powerful hurricane as the system entered the central Caribbean Sea,[4] but these forecasts were lowered in later advisories. Despite an impressive satellite presentation associated with Earl as it passed through the southern Leeward Islands, a hurricane hunter flight reported that the system no longer had a low-level circulation late on August\u00a015. As a result, the NHC discontinued advisories on the system and declared it an open tropical wave. While not entirely sure, it is suspected that the fast motion of the cyclone attributed to its dissipation. The remnant wave eventually entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, developing into Hurricane Frank by August\u00a023.[3][5]"

        "content": "Following the development of Tropical Storm Earl, tropical storm watches were issued for Barbados, St. Vincent, and St. Lucia. This watch was modified to a tropical storm warning by August\u00a014 at 2100\u00a0UTC, with the addition of the islands of the Grenadines, Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada. The tropical storm warning for Barbados was changed to a tropical storm watch the following day at 1200\u00a0UTC, and all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued by 1800\u00a0UTC. In preparation of the storm, several hundred people in Grenada evacuated from low-lying areas to schools set up as shelters.[6] Shopkeepers boarded windows, while airports were temporarily shut down across the Leeward Islands.[7] Initial forecasts predicted that Earl would strengthen considerably into a hurricane and head towards Florida once in the Caribbean Sea, a state already impacted heavily earlier in the month by Hurricane Charley. The local officials urged residents to exercise caution, but not panic due to the large errors in long-range forecasts.[8] These warnings eased upon the system's degeneration into an open tropical wave.[3] In Grenada, Earl produced heavy rains and strong winds that caused moderate damage. On the main island, roofs were blown off twelve homes while three others were partially damaged; twelve trees and six power poles were also knocked down by the winds. The heavy rain associated with the tropical storm triggered nine mudslides and three rockslides on the island. Nearby, six homes had their roofs completely blown off while thirteen others were damaged. Flooding was also reported on both islands; however, no known damage resulted from them.[9] During the storm, a nursing home had to be evacuated due to significant damage to the structure.[10] On St Vincent and the Grenadines, at least two homes had their roofs blown off and banana crops sustained moderate damage.[11] In Tobago, numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the island, cutting power to 90% of the island.[10][12] The highest surface sustained winds in relation to Earl occurred on the morning of August 15 in Barbados and St. Lucia; winds were reported at 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h).[3] One person was killed by the storm and nineteen others were listed as missing.[13] Following the storm, Grenada requested assistance from the United States Agency of International Development. Local crews worked quickly to cover broken roofs and repair other structural damage. The National Emergency Relief organization were sought for assistance.[9]"

The storm then moved out into the southern Plains States, bringing heavy snow to Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas. Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms, with hail, wind, and tornadoes, affected parts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. The storm then moved across the Mid-Atlantic States, and into the Atlantic Ocean, following the East Coast. The storm then rapidly intensified into a major nor'easter, with the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. The storm stalled just offshore from New York City and continued to strengthen. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 968\u00a0millibars (28.58\u00a0in\u00a0Hg), equivalent to that of a moderate Category 2 hurricane.[1]"

Local rail and transit  lines reported delays and cancellations affecting the MTA, NJ Transit, LIRR, and Metro-North Railroad. Power failures affected several thousand people.[2] On April 16, 2007, the storm caused sustained winds of nearly 100\u00a0mph (87\u00a0knots) on, and near New Hampshire's Mount Washington, with gusts topping out at 156\u00a0mph (136\u00a0knots).[3] While areas closer to the shore received heavy rainfall, higher regions inland  received unseasonal snow.[4] Several towns suffered from flooding including Mamaroneck in New York, and Bound Brook and Manville in New Jersey,  while coastal towns had to deal with damage from high tides.  Most major highways in Westchester County, New York were closed on April 15 and April 16 due to extreme flooding. In Quebec, several regions including the Laurentides and Charlevoix regions received in excess of 6\u00a0inches (15\u00a0cm) of snow with areas exceeding well above 1\u00a0foot (30\u00a0cm) of snow. In the city of Ottawa, 17\u00a0cm (5\u00a0in) of heavy wet snow fell in just a few hours causing power lines and trees to fall down causing scattered blackouts in several parts of the city.[5]  Similar damage was reported in the higher elevations north of Montreal and Ottawa. In total, more than 175,000 homes in Canada suffered a power outage, including 160,000 Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec customers mainly in areas from Gatineau towards Quebec City including Montreal, Lanaudi\u00e8re and the Laurentians with an additional 15,000 Hydro One and Hydro Ottawa customers.[6]  In the US over a quarter million homes lost power with New York and Pennsylvania being the hardest hit states due to the strong winds. Governor Eliot Spitzer of New York activated 3,200 members of the National Guard on alert. Richard Codey, acting governor of New Jersey, declared a state of emergency.[7] The storm was blamed for several fatalities, including one person in a tornado in South Carolina, two people in storm-related traffic accidents in New  York and Connecticut,[8]  two people in West Virginia, three people in New Jersey,[9] and prior to its arrival in the East, five deaths in Kansas and Texas.[2] In Quebec, an accident between a van and a tractor trailer killed five occupants of the van in a highway north of Montreal.[10] Numerous other accidents were reported by OPP and the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec during the storm. The Boston Marathon  took place in what many considered to be the worst weather in its 110-year history. Race officials held serious talks about whether or not to cancel the race.[11] The men's race had the slowest winning time in thirty years (1977). In the women's race, \"[t]he rainy and windy conditions led to the slowest winning time since 1985\".[12] High winds during the storm prevented emergency medical services from using helicopters for evacuation of the injured at the Virginia Tech massacre.[13] The Internal Revenue Service delayed by two days the deadline for tax filing for victims of the nor'easter.[14] While filing for federal disaster relief, acting governor Codey of New Jersey indicated that the storm caused $180\u00a0million in property damage in New Jersey, making it the second-worst rain storm in its history, after Hurricane Floyd.[9] In addition, New Hampshire received $30.5 million in aid following the storm, the most aid received for any storm in state history.[15]"

        "content": " The December 1969 nor'easter was a strong winter storm that mainly affected the Northeastern United States and southern Quebec between December 25 and December 28, 1969. The multi-faceted storm system included a tornado outbreak, record snow accumulations, a damaging ice storm, and flooding rains. The storm developed over Texas by December 25 and advanced eastward, spawning over a dozen tornadoes in Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida. Upon reaching the Eastern Seaboard, the cyclone turned northeastward and intensified into a powerful nor'easter. On December 26 and 27, the storm's forward movement slowed to a drift, causing very heavy snow over Upstate New York, Vermont, and southern Quebec. Warm onshore winds, caused by a storm track close to the shore, allowed precipitation to change to sleet and rain in central and eastern New England. Where precipitation remained as snow, accumulations reached 40 inches (100\u00a0cm) or more, crippling travel. Drifts up to 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) high blocked roadways, isolating some communities and forcing emergency workers to rely on snowmobiles for transportation. At least 20 fatalities were attributed to the storm in New York and New England. In central New England, a severe freezing rain event occurred along the boundary between cold air to the west and warmer air to the east. Several inches of glaze ice, accompanied by gale-force winds, caused damage comparable to the aftermath of the 1938 New England hurricane. Throughout the region, the snow and ice\u2014in some cases further weighted by heavy rainfall\u2014caused roofs to cave in. Montreal received 27.5\u00a0in (70\u00a0cm) of snow in that city's biggest snowstorm on record at the time; officials blamed the storm for 15 deaths in Quebec. In eastern New England, ice jams, poor drainage, and several inches of rain caused flooding that forced people from their homes and submerged roadways. Wind gusts to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and strong waves battered the coastline."

NAO values dropped significantly in the wake of the nor'easter, signaling abnormally cold temperatures during January 1970.[1][3] December 1969 was a month of active weather throughout the Northeast, with frequent light to moderate snow events preceding the late-month nor'easter. A significant storm on December 22\u201323 dropped 8 to 24\u00a0in (20 to 60\u00a0cm) of snow in eastern New York and northern New England,[4][5] as well as significant freezing rain in southern and eastern New England. Many of the same areas would be impacted again just days later.[6] Before the cyclone's arrival, a 1,033\u00a0hPa (30.5\u00a0inHg) high-pressure area situated north of New England funneled very cold air into the region; the \u221222\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230\u00a0\u00b0C) air temperature at Albany, New York, on December 25 still holds the record for the city's coldest December temperature.[7] On December 25 and 26, extensive cold air damming and frontogenesis occurred along the U.S. East Coast. The high-pressure area slowly retreated as the storm approached.[8]"

        "content": "The nor'easter originated in a weak area of surface low pressure that formed over northern Texas by December 25. It moved generally eastward over the next day as it crossed the Deep South.[9] A southerly low-level jet (a localized wind stream in the lower levels of the atmosphere) developed by midday over Mississippi and Alabama, and drifted eastward.[10] Precipitation soon blossomed, with heavy snow falling over the Appalachian Mountains by late on December 25. The low turned toward the northeast by early on December 26 to follow the temperature gradient along the East Coast, at which time the storm underwent the first of two periods of rapid intensification. In 12 hours, barometric pressure fell 12 hPa to 996\u00a0hPa (29.4\u00a0inHg) while the nor'easter accelerated from Georgia to the coast of New Jersey.[8] This bout of strengthening  occurred as the associated upper-level trough at the 500-millibar level\u00a0\u2013 several miles into the atmosphere\u00a0\u2013 assumed a negative tilt from northwest to southeast.[1] Heavy precipitation overspread the Mid-Atlantic and New England early on December 26.[8] The low-level jet continued to strengthen and delivered warm air to areas east of the storm center, where precipitation quickly transitioned to rain. The jet ultimately reached extremely high velocities of 55\u00a0m/s (120\u00a0mph) as it wrapped around the northern side of the low, feeding abundant moisture into areas of heavy precipitation.[1] The storm slowed drastically on December 26,[8] and over the next 24 hours, it moved very slowly from Cape May, New Jersey, to near Boston, Massachusetts.[4] During this period, exceptionally heavy snow fell over eastern New York, Vermont, and southern Quebec. While located just east of Long Island on December 27, the nor'easter began its second phase of rapid strengthening that brought central pressure down to 976\u00a0hPa (28.8\u00a0inHg). During this period of intensification, snow propagated around the western side of the system, reaching as far south as Long Island.[8] With a storm track very close to the shore and a retreating high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A frontal boundary between the warm Atlantic air and a residual wedge of colder air over the interior served as the focus for a severe ice storm in central New England.[8] Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas.[11][12] By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed cold-core low.[1] The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.[8]"

One woman was killed and eight were injured, three severely enough to require hospitalization. Another damaging tornado moved through several settlements in southern Iberville Parish just over two hours later; the tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged multiple other buildings, with one injury reported. The tornado was officially classified an F3,[6] though meteorologist Thomas P. Grazulis determined it to have caused damage consistent with an F2 rating.[14] A non-tornadic wind gust destroyed a nearby trailer home.[6] Later that day, a tornado skipped along a path through Catahoula and Concordia parishes, touching down three different times. The F2 tornado damaged about 20 trailer homes in Glade, and caused further damage near the end of its track.[14] A tornado in southern Georgia, about 9\u00a0mi (14\u00a0km) west of Albany,[14] damaged or destroyed several small homes, killed three head of cattle, toppled numerous trees, and injured seven people. Elsewhere in the state, there were isolated reports of hail and damaging thunderstorm winds.[15] Several tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle caused minor to moderate damage to trees and homes, the most destructive of them occurring in Quincy, Florida.[16] That tornado struck an industrial area and unroofed at least three structures.[17] A tornado in Lee, Florida, destroyed a trailer, damaged farm buildings, and injured one person.[16] In addition to widespread rain, parts of northern South Carolina experienced freezing rain that damaged trees and power lines. Freezing rain and sleet fell over the southern Piedmont of North Carolina, resulting in power outages and dangerous travel conditions.[18] At least one fatal traffic accident was reported. Heavy snow covered the northwest Piedmont and Mountain Region of the state, accumulating to around 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) at Asheville;[19] occurring on the heels of another winter storm, this snowfall contributed to depths up to 2\u00a0ft (60\u00a0cm) at higher elevations.[18] High winds from the storm left at least 50,000 electric customers in the Richmond, Virginia region without power. In Carroll County, strong winds uprooted trees.[17] Significant snow accumulations occurred throughout the Mid-Atlantic, chiefly away from the coastal plain. Snowfall exceeded 10\u00a0in (25\u00a0cm) in parts of western Virginia, western Maryland, and West Virginia; Washington, D.C. received 12.1\u00a0in (31\u00a0cm) of snow.[8]"

Rescuers also used snowmobiles and aircraft to search for stranded residents and travelers.[5][20] Many cities and counties throughout the Northeast issued snow emergencies.[12][26] Business and industry suffered extensively in the days following the storm.[12] While major highways were generally cleared by December 29,[4] some local roads reportedly remained covered for up to a month.[21] About 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) of the New York State Thruway\u2014nearly half its total length\u2014was closed for 27 hours.[27][28] The snowfall also caused widespread property damage, as the roofs of barns, sheds, and other buildings caved in under the weight of the snow. An airport hangar in Oneonta collapsed, destroying five aircraft inside. In the aftermath of the storm, many homes sustained water damage from melting snow. \"Innumerable\" traffic accidents were reported, and many motorists became stranded or were forced to abandon their vehicles.[12] Four people in a stalled automobile died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Also in New York, one man froze to death, and three individuals were killed in a building collapse.[12] In the Capital District, the snow fell with a high water content, occasionally mixing with freezing rain. As a result, it was much denser than normal and proved difficult to manage. The City of Albany spent a record $2\u00a0million USD on snow removal,[21] and the city restricted nearly all traffic except for vehicles necessary to maintain emergency supplies.[20] Governor Nelson Rockefeller closed state offices in Albany on December 29 and 30, in an effort to enable efficient snow removal.[29] Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd assessed the situation as a \"dire emergency\".[30] Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts.[31] Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer.[20] One person died in Saxtons River.[5] With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk.[12][25] In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually.[20] One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.[12] The influx of warm, moist air over a wedge of cold air near the surface resulted in a severe ice storm across central and northern New England, most notably in the upper Connecticut River Valley. Glaze ice thicker than 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm), and reportedly up to 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) thick in Vermont, built up on trees and power lines, wreaking \"unbelievable\" havoc.[5] In the hardest-hit areas, damage from the ice storm was comparable to that caused by the 1938 New England hurricane.[12] The combined load of snow and ice caused significant damage to many residential and industrial buildings, with several factory and warehouse roofs collapsing.[5][32] Livestock were killed in multiple rural building collapses throughout the area.[5] Southern Maine endured its second damaging ice storm in a week, with many of the same communities losing power on both occasion.[6] Precipitation also transitioned to freezing rain and sleet across interior Connecticut, where the dangerous conditions induced numerous traffic accidents.[11] Due to the abnormally cold temperatures in the wake of the storm, the glaze persisted for up to six weeks, much longer than the typical three days for ice storms in New England.[32] The changeover to heavy rain in southern and eastern New England swelled frozen rivers, creating ice jams which induced severe flooding. Flooding of roadways and homes was compounded by drainage issues from the dense snowcover.[6] Rising floodwaters forced hundreds of families to leave their homes in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. Up to 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain fell in the Boston region, where thousands of homes were inundated. Rivers had begun to recede by December 29 after cresting well above flood stage.[31][33] Up to 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain fell over Rhode Island after 6 to 11\u00a0in (15 to 28\u00a0cm) of snow, with widespread flooding reported in multiple towns. Frequent automobile accidents and large traffic jams were reported in the state.[5] Winds were strongest in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where gusts peaked near 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). The gales were particularly damaging to trees laden with snow and ice. The heavy rainfall in eastern Massachusetts added tremendous weigh to the snow that had already fallen, causing roof collapses and making it difficult to clear the snow. In southeastern New Hampshire, the strong winds toppled trees and blew out windows in Hampton Beach.[12] Although the coastal plain of New England avoided the heaviest snow accumulations, pounding surf and strong winds battered piers, boats, and other coastal installations, while low-lying areas experienced storm surge flooding.[34]"

Rail, air, and automobile transportation were paralyzed.[36] One individual in Quebec City was struck and killed by a snowplow, and two more died of exposure to cold while ice fishing on the St. Lawrence River. Several fires broke out in Montreal during the storm, killing at least six people and leaving 23 families homeless.[35] In total, the storm was connected to at least 15 fatalities in the province.[36][37]"

        "content": "On October 2 at 06:00 UTC, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 1] started to monitor a persistent area of convection in the Philippine Sea, located 495 nautical miles (917\u00a0km; 570\u00a0mi) to the east of Davao City, Philippines. At that time, satellite visible imagery revealed a disorganized but broad area of circulation with flaring strong thunderstorms. Later analysis by the agency indicated a favorable environment for further development of the system, with warm 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures, low wind shear and good equatorial outflow.[3][4] Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression on 2:00 PHT (18:00 UTC) of October 3, assigning it the name Lannie from their naming list as it was already present in their Philippine Area of Responsibility.[5][6] Also that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system as it showed enough convection on the west of a discernible low-level circulation center while tracking west-northwestward.[7] However, a trough associated with the disturbance crossed the Philippines, the JTWC subsequently canceled their TCFA on the system and lowered the probability of the system's development to \"medium\".[8] The PAGASA, however, continued to track Lannie as it made 8 landfalls in the country; first at 04:30 PHT (20:00 UTC) on Bucas Grande Island, then on Cagdianao in the Dinagat Islands, then over Liloan and Padre Burgos in Southern Leyte, then Mahanay Island and Getafe in Bohol, San Fernando in Cebu then over Guihulngan, Negros Oriental before emerging into the Sulu Sea. Continuing its track to the west-northwest, it made two more landfalls in Palawan; one on Iloc Island in Linapacan and over El Nido before finally moving over and accelerated into the South China Sea.[9][10] At 14:30 UTC of October 4, the JTWC reissued a TCFA once again on the system as it reorganized along with a conducive environment in the area.[11] A day later at 06:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] recognized the system in their bulletins as a tropical depression.[13] Lannie exited the PAR at 11:00 PhST (03:00 UTC) on October 6 as it slightly inclined northwestward.[14] On October 7 at 09:00 UTC, the JTWC further upgraded the storm to a tropical depression, receiving the designation 22W from the agency. The system, at that time, also consolidated further while transitioning to a monsoon depression as it continued to maintain a broad center with its wind field contracting along with 25-30 knot winds occurring in its core.[15] Meanwhile, while centered over the northern Paracel Islands, the JMA reported that the system intensified to a tropical storm according to surface wind analysis and Dvorak ratings, nine hours later. The agency named the system Lionrock while the storm became stationary due to weak steering flow.[16] However, the JTWC only followed suit on the next day as it turned northward as it was steered by the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge located to the northeast.[17] The storm maintained this intensity before making landfall over Qionghai on 22:50 CST (14:50 UTC), further organizing its LLCC and its overall structure while located inland. It subsequently reintensified to its peak winds of 40 knots (75\u00a0km/h; 45\u00a0mph), ten minutes later.[18][19] However, it weakened slightly while over the central part of the island, although its convective banding continued to consolidate.[20] Early on October 9, Lionrock emerged into the very warm and conducive waters of the Gulf of Tonkin.[20] However, it maintained its intensity of 35 knots (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph) before it made its last landfall over Haiphong, near Cat Bi International Airport on 09:00 UTC on the next day, with the JTWC issuing its final warning as a tropical depression. Although, its LLC remained somewhat defined on radar imagery but its winds weakened upon moving inland.[21] The JMA also downgraded Lionrock to a depression three hours back as it tracked westward while over Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province of Vietnam.[22]"

In Siraway, Zamboanga del Norte, some residents living in the area were evacuated due to the same effect, causing waistline floods while nearly 200 families in Pikit, Cotabato City were rescued due to rain-induced flash floods that occurred from October 3\u20134.[26] A family of three were also moved into safety by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on October 4 when their boat sank during the high waves from the storm between Pamilacan Island and Loay, Bohol while two more fishermen were rescued by the authorities off Abacan River in Cortes.[27] In Tanjay, a man slipped into a spillway and were subsequently helped by stranded residents near the area while 50 households were evacuated to safety as a river overflowed in Bais, Negros Oriental. Landslides were also reported on Cebu City and Talisay City while vaccination activities for October 5 on Zamboanga City were canceled as a result of bad weather and its resultant flooding in houses and rice fields.[28] Five vessels and fifteen passengers in Palawan were stranded as a result of Lannie, the PCG reported on the same day.[29] Four fatalities were already reported in the country as a result of the storm, three due to drowning in Capiz and Cebu and the other one is unknown. Damages in Western Visayas were calculated to be at \u20b11.6\u00a0million (US$31,555).

        "content": " Hurricane Greta, later Hurricane Olivia, was one of fourteen named Atlantic hurricanes to cross over Central America into the eastern Pacific while remaining a tropical cyclone. The seventh named storm of the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season, Greta formed from a tropical wave just northwest of Trinidad on September\u00a013, and despite being in a climatologically unfavorable area, gradually intensified while moving west-northwestward. On September\u00a016, it became a hurricane south of Jamaica. Two days later, the well-defined eye approached northeastern Honduras but veered to the northwest. After reaching peak winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) that day, Greta weakened while paralleling the northern Honduras coast just offshore. On September\u00a019, it made landfall on Belize near Dangriga and quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing Guatemala and southeastern Mexico. After entering the eastern Pacific, the system re-intensified into a hurricane and was renamed Olivia, the eighteenth named storm of the 1978 Pacific hurricane season which weakened before landfall and dissipated over Chiapas on September\u00a023. Taking a similar path to Hurricane Fifi four years prior, Greta threatened to reproduce the devastating effects of the catastrophic storm; however, damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared. In Honduras, about 1,200\u00a0homes were damaged, about half of which in towns along the coastline. The storm damaged about 75% of the houses on Roat\u00e1n along the offshore Bay Islands, and there was one death in the country. In the Belize Barrier Reef, Greta downed trees and produced high waves, while on the mainland, there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge. In Dangriga where it made landfall, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125\u00a0houses and the primary hospital. In Belize City, a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four houses. Damage in Belize was estimated at $25\u00a0million (1978\u00a0USD), and there were four deaths."

        "content": "A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September\u00a07. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned an area of convection three days later, which gradually organized. On September\u00a013, the wave moved through the Windward Islands, producing wind gusts of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on Barbados. Later that day, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression about 75\u00a0mi (121\u00a0km) west-northwest of Trinidad, based on ship and land reports. Though located in a climatologically unfavorable area, the depression intensified and continued to develop. A hurricane hunter on September\u00a014 indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta to the north of the Netherlands Antilles.[1] After becoming a tropical storm, Greta intensified slowly due to a strong trough to the northwest,[1] and with the South American coastline located to the south, the southerly inflow was disrupted.[2] With a ridge to the north along the 30th parallel, the storm moved quickly west-northwestward across the Caribbean.[3] On September\u00a016, Greta intensified into a hurricane about 275\u00a0mi (443\u00a0km) south of Jamaica.[1] Shortly thereafter, the trough to the northwest weakened, which had been preventing the storm's intensification.[1] An increasingly well-defined eye developed while approaching the coast of Honduras as the barometric pressure quickly dropped.[4] Early on September\u00a018, the eyewall passed just offshore Cabo Gracias a Dios, the sparsely populated border between Honduras and Nicaragua[4][5] The NHC described the eye as having \"literally ricocheted off of the protruding northeast coast of Honduras\", thus sparing much of the country from the strongest winds. At 0710\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, the Hurricane hunters observed a minimum pressure of 947\u00a0mbar (28.0\u00a0inHg) just off the northern Honduras coast, which was the basis for the estimated peak intensity of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h).[4] This made it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[6] Despite the proximity to land, Greta initially maintained a well-defined structure. The hurricane continued generally west-northwestward due to the ridge to the north, and initially was expected to enter the Bay of Campeche.[7] After passing through the Bay Islands off northern Honduras,[5] Greta weakened slightly while approaching Belize, and made landfall near Dangriga at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019,[4] with winds of about 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).[6] The calm of the eye was reported for three to five minutes there.[8] Rapidly weakening over land, the hurricane deteriorated to tropical depression status over Guatemala within 12\u00a0hours of landfall. A large high pressure area from the Carolinas to the central Gulf of Mexico turned Greta southwestward toward the eastern Pacific Ocean.[9] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) took over responsibility for issuing advisories while Greta was 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) from the coast. Soon after, the depression emerged over the warm waters of the eastern Pacific and re-intensified. At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the depression re-attained tropical storm status and named Olivia by the EPHC. After initially moving to the north, Olivia began executing a slow counterclockwise loop. Based on observations from nearby ships and radar, it is estimated Olivia attained minimal hurricane status early on September\u00a022. While tracking towards the Mexican coastline, the system weakened below hurricane threshold; between 19:00 and 20:00\u00a0UTC, Olivia made landfall about 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) east of Salina Cruz. Early on September\u00a023, Olivia dissipated over the Mexican state of Chiapas.[10] Hurricane Greta\u2013Olivia was a rare crossover storm from the Atlantic to the Pacific, one of only fourteen named storms to maintain tropical cyclone status during the crossing.[6][11]"

Around the same time, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning for the eastern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula,[12] and on September\u00a018 a hurricane warning was issued for the Belize and Guatemala coastlines.[13] These advanced warnings helped reduce fatalities.[9] In Puerto Castilla, Honduras, about 2,000\u00a0people were evacuated in advance of the storm.[14] The Honduran government put its military, police, and Red Cross on standby in advance of the storm, due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Fifi in 1974.[15] However, unlike Fifi, which caused deadly floods in the region four years prior and took a similar track, Greta did not cause as significant river flooding in Honduras.[4][5] Across much of Greta's track in Central America, the hurricane dropped locally heavy rainfall.[9] When Greta passed just offshore northeastern Honduras, it produced sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) in Puerto Lempira, with gusts to 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Winds along the northern Honduras coast were diminished due to the eyewall passing to the north.[4] In Honduras, meteorologists estimated that upwards of 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) of rain fell in mountainous regions. Many villages were isolated and communication with them was severely hampered.[16] In Puerto Lempira, roughly 1,500 of the town's 7,000 residents sought refuge in five large structures during the storm.[17] In twelve communities along the coastline, military officials reported that 656 homes were destroyed, of which 278 were in Punta Potuca.[18] In the offshore Bay Islands, the hurricane destroyed 26\u00a0houses on Guanaja, where many roofs were lost and several boats were destroyed. On nearby Roat\u00e1n, about 75% of the houses lost their roofs after experiencing wind gusts of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[19] There was one death in Honduras,[9] and nationwide, the hurricane damaged about 1,200\u00a0homes, washed out roads and bridges, and wrecked coconut and rice crops.[20] At Greta's final landfall in Belize, the highest sustained winds were 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) in Belize City,[9] with gusts to 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) at Dangriga near the landfall location.[21] On the offshore Ambergris Caye, winds reached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), and there was heavy rainfall.[22] On Half Moon Caye, the hurricane damaged the base of a lighthouse and knocked over several coconut trees.[23] Along the Belize Barrier Reef, the hurricane downed palm trees and produced high waves, with significant wave heights of about 33\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) along Carrie Bow Caye.[24] On the mainland, storm tides in Dangriga were 6 to 7\u00a0ft (1.8 to 2.1\u00a0m) above normal, which did not cause much flooding.[9] The strong winds destroyed 50\u00a0houses there and unroofed a further 75,[8] including damage to the hospital. There were also disruptions to power and water service. About 90% of the grapefruit crop was destroyed, and 50% of the orange crop was lost.[25] Tides were 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) above normal in Belize City,[9] which caused flooding in conjunction with swollen rivers.[25] The United States embassy was flooded with about one foot of mud.[26] There was little damage in the city,[25] although a tornado in Belize City that damaged four houses and flipped over a truck.[27] During the storm, the Belize International Airport was closed.[28] Farther inland, strong winds caused heavy damage at Guanacaste National Park.[23] Damage throughout Belize was estimated at $25\u00a0million (1978\u00a0USD), and there were four deaths.[9] Three of the deaths were on offshore islands in areas without radios, and the other was due to electrocution.[29]"

The aid was distributed by the Military of Honduras.[20] In late October 1978, the United Methodist Church sent books and other supplies via aircraft to Belize, after a youth group rode out the storm there and desired to help residents.[30] Despite the hurricane damage, the economy of Belize continued to grow after Greta struck, including an increase in banana production.[31] On account of the damage caused by the hurricane in the Atlantic basin, the name Greta was retired in the spring of 1979 by the regional hurricane committee of the World Meteorological Organization. It will never again be used to name a tropical system in the basin.[32]"

Gerda brushed past the Outer Banks of North Carolina before reaching maximum intensity of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) and a low barometric pressure of 980 millibars (29\u00a0inHg). On September 10, Gerda made landfall near Eastport, Maine, and became extratropical the following day. Hurricane Gerda brought light rain across southern Florida and moderate to heavy rain across eastern North Carolina and New England, causing minor damage to trees and powerlines. The highest amount of rain was 5.67 inches (144\u00a0mm) which was recorded in South Wellfleet, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. There were no fatalities or injuries from Gerda although planes at Otis Air Force Base were moved to their hangars and two ships from Naval Station Newport left their berth to ride out the storm."

        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on August 21 and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development. On September 3, the disturbance merged with a dissipating upper-level low pressure system over Hispaniola and Puerto Rico and developed an increasing cloud mass as it continued westward. As the disturbance crossed the Bahamas, satellite imagery showed the disturbance gaining a distinct circulation on September 5. On September 6, the disturbance became a Tropical Depression before it made landfall in southeastern Florida on the same day.[2] After crossing Florida, the depression drifted northeastward back over the western Atlantic Ocean on September 7. As the system headed northeastward, hurricane hunter aircraft recorded winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), and barometric pressure fell to 1,000 millibars (30\u00a0inHg). Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center upgraded the system to tropical storm status and named it Gerda. Gerda continued to move rapidly northeast in response to an approaching trough and the storm reached hurricane status on September 8. Gerda's forward speed approached 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) as the eye of the hurricane passed 50 miles (80\u00a0km) east of Cape Cod on September 9, with maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h). Because the storm was interacting with the trough to the west and was moving rapidly northeastward, the result was the minimum central barometric pressure was an unusually high 980 millibars (29\u00a0inHg).[2]  Gerda later made landfall near Eastport, Maine later that day as a Category\u00a01 hurricane, one of the strongest to ever make landfall in the state.[2] However, while the storm made landfall as a hurricane, the strongest winds remained offshore. Thus, Gerda likely caused only tropical storm force winds in the state.[3] Gerda then became extratropical as it crossed into Canada as an 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) extratropical storm on September 10. The storm later dissipated the following day.[4]"

In Massachusetts, schools were closed and emergency shelters were opened to accommodate evacuees. Evacuations were ordered for residents living in low-lying areas in Cape Cod. In Boston, the threat of the storm caused both elementary and middle schools to close at noon while high schools were closed at 1 p.m. (est).[6] The approach of the storm also postponed a fair at a local hospital and planes at Otis Air Force Base were quickly moved to their hangars. Much of southeastern Massachusetts civil defense and fire departments were alerted in preparation of the storm's impact. In Rhode Island, schools and other buildings were used as shelter to house evacuees.[9] As Hurricane Gerda sped up the East Coast of the United States, the National Hurricane Center extended the hurricane warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Eastport, Maine.[10] At Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island, two ships of the United States Navy left their berths to ride out the storm.

The wave closely followed the path of Tropical Storm Sebastien and was unable to develop in the tropical Atlantic as it moved westward. The system did not begin to become organized until October\u00a025 while south-southeast of Bermuda. However, the Dvorak technique was still unable to classify the system until October\u00a026 as the low-cloud swirl became better organized while moving northward in the central Atlantic. That evening, a closed circulation had formed, and it was classified as Tropical Depression Twenty-One by the National Hurricane Center. On the morning of October\u00a027, it strengthened into a tropical storm, becoming the 19th as well as the final named storm of the season.[1] Operationally, it was not declared a tropical cyclone until that point, when it was immediately declared Tropical Storm Tanya.[2] Immediately after becoming a tropical storm, the movement of Tanya became hindered by a nearby upper-level low, and it quickly turned eastward before virtually stalling early on October\u00a028.[3] The upper-level low also influenced Tanya in giving it some subtropical characteristics, including a comma-shaped cloud band and maximum winds far from the center of the storm at the time.[1] Despite that, the storm gradually strengthened as it remained over warm waters of about 81\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C).[3] That afternoon, it gained full tropical characteristics, as an eye featured was beginning to form in the central dense overcast.[4] The eye became clearly defined, although it was small in size. Early on October 29, Tropical Storm Tanya was upgraded to a hurricane, the eleventh of the 1995\u00a0season, as it turned northward in response to the nearby low.[5] Later on October\u00a029, while slowly tracking north, Tanya leveled off as a low-end Category 1 hurricane. By the next morning, a cold front to the west forced Tanya to accelerate in a more easterly track .[6] It remained fairly well organized with a distinct eye as it became wedged in a narrow zone of warm air between the cold front to the west and the upper-level low to the northeast.[1] Despite slightly cooler water, Tanya strengthened a bit more that afternoon, reaching its peak intensity of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) with a barometric pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg) as the forward speed increased.[7] That intensity was maintained until late on October\u00a031, when Tanya began to weaken as it traveled over cooler waters and the eye became obscured.[8] Early on November\u00a01, Tanya began to lose tropical characteristics while still a hurricane. Hurricane Tanya was also heading rapidly northeast towards the Azores at the time.[9] Tanya was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm on November\u00a01. Despite weakening, the wind field of Tanya became larger.[10] That evening, Tanya was declared fully extratropical as it passed the Azores.[11] The remnant cyclone turned north, before being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone early on November 3.[1]"

Extensive property damage was reported, including many capsized boats and several damaged or destroyed homes. Significant agricultural damage also occurred there. Many trees and power lines were knocked down, cutting electricity and hampering communications in the area. The highest wind gusts reported in the Azores were around 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h). After the storm, a resolution was submitted to the European Parliament by the Government of Portugal and a disaster area was declared in the islands.[13] One Spanish fisherman drowned and several people were injured.[13] There were many reports of tropical storm-force winds from ships in the north Atlantic. One ship, with the call sign GBSA, encountered Tanya's winds twice and reported the strongest winds from any ship, 71\u00a0mph (112\u00a0km/h).[1] Hurricane Tanya was the first tropical cyclone to be designated a name starting with the letter \"T\" since naming of Atlantic tropical cyclones began in 1950.[14] There have been six subsequent T-named Atlantic tropical storms: Tammy in 2005 and 2023, Tomas in 2010, Tony in 2012, Teddy in 2020, and Teresa in 2021.[14][15]"

The twelfth named storm of the season, Leslie formed on October\u00a04 over eastern Florida as a subtropical cyclone, out of a trough of low pressure. Strengthening over open waters, it attained enough tropical characteristics to be reclassified as Tropical Storm Leslie on October\u00a05. The storm reached peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) before wind shear weakened it, and on October\u00a07 transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the open Atlantic Ocean. Leslie lasted three more days before losing its identity. The precursor to Leslie produced torrential rainfall across Florida, peaking at 17.5\u00a0in (440\u00a0mm). The flooding damaged thousands of houses and caused three indirect deaths. Damage in southern Florida totaled $950\u00a0million (2000\u00a0USD),[nb 1] around half of which was from agricultural damage. After the flooding, portions of south Florida were declared a disaster area. Because of the limited impact as a tropical cyclone, the name Leslie was not retired in the spring of 2001."

        "content": "On September\u00a027, a tropical wave entered the eastern Caribbean Sea, believed to be the same that spawned Hurricane Isaac. It moved generally westward, and remained weak with sporadic thunderstorm activity. The wave traversed around the periphery of Hurricane Keith, and by October\u00a02, the system produced a mid-level circulation just south of western Cuba. It continued to organize, prompting a reconnaissance aircraft to investigate the area. The system lacked a surface circulation center and remained an elongated trough of low pressure. The tropical wave interacted with an approaching frontal trough, while its mid-level center turned to the northeast and made landfall near Sarasota, Florida on October\u00a04.[1] While over land, a surface circulation developed near Orlando, and the National Hurricane Center designated the system as Subtropical Depression One. The subtropical designation was because the convection was far-removed from the center.[1] Additionally, an upper-level trough provided outflow, instead of an anticyclone as found in tropical cyclones.[2] The subtropical depression moved to the east-northeast, and steadily organized as deep convection developed closer to the center. Initially, the strongest winds were 175\u00a0mi (280\u00a0km) from the center, but by the morning of October\u00a05, the distance decreased to 85\u00a0mi (135\u00a0km). Based on its organization and winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h), the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Leslie.[1] The National Hurricane Center initially forecast further intensification to 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h),[3] although the agency also noted that the circulation could dissipate, due its fast forward motion toward the east-northeast. Ultimately, wind shear prohibited significant strengthening,[4] and Leslie attained peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h).[1] The storm interacted with an approaching cold front and became extratropical on October\u00a07, 375\u00a0mi (600\u00a0km) north of Bermuda. It accelerated to the northeast and passed over Newfoundland on October\u00a08. The remnants of Leslie turned to the east, then southeast, strengthening to near-hurricane-force winds before losing its identity near Ireland on October\u00a010.[1]"

Six hours later, tropical storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. However, the storm passed well to the west, and the warnings were dropped by late on October\u00a06.[1]"

All schools in the Miami area were closed, and all non-essential Miami-Dade County employees were asked to stay home. Numerous flights in Miami International Airport were canceled or delayed, although the airport remained opened.[12] The flooding, which was greatest in Sweetwater, West Miami, Hialeah, Opa-locka, and Pembroke Park, lasted up to a week in areas.[14] The extreme flooding damaged electrical stations, leaving more than 27,000 without power.[10] The flooding indirectly killed three people, two from drowning as a result of driving vehicles into deep water,[1] and one when a man fell from a tall building while trying to unclog a roof drain.[12] Property damage totaled $450\u00a0million.[14] Flood waters in Miami-Dade County covered about 40,000\u00a0acres (160\u00a0km\u00b2) of farmland. The damage was worsened since the flooding occurred at the beginning of the planting period for the winter season. Flooded nurseries and fields resulted in about $500\u00a0million in agricultural damage, including $60\u00a0million in tropical fruit and $397\u00a0million in ornamental crops.[15] The U.S. Department of Agriculture declared 16\u00a0Florida counties, including Miami-Dade, Collier, and Palm Beach, as primary disaster areas due to flooding, making farmers and their families there eligible for USDA emergency farm loans. The same agency made 22 other counties, including Broward, eligible for loans due to their proximity to the disaster areas.[16] As an extratropical storm, Leslie produced winds of around 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) while making landfall in Newfoundland. It also caused waves of up to 16\u00a0ft (five\u00a0m) in height, and brought up to one\u00a0in (30\u00a0mm) of rain. The overall impact in this region was minor.[17]"

The seventh named storm, sixth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season, it was the strongest and deadliest system of the season. Fox developed northwest of Cartagena, Colombia, in the southern Caribbean Sea. It moved steadily northwest, intensifying to a tropical storm on October 21. The next day, it rapidly strengthened into a hurricane and turned north passing closely to Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands.[1] The cyclone attained peak winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) as it struck Cayo Guano del Este off the coast of Cienfuegos. Fox made landfall on Cuba at maximum intensity, producing peak gusts of 170\u2013180\u00a0mph (270\u2013290\u00a0km/h). It weakened over land, but it re-strengthened as it turned east over the Bahamas. On October 26, it weakened and took an erratic path, dissipating west-southwest of Bermuda on October 28. Fox was the second most intense hurricane to strike Cuba until Hurricane Michelle in 2001. It was originally believed to have been the second Category\u00a04 hurricane in Cuba prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis. At the time, the cyclone produced the fourth lowest pressure in a landfalling Cuban hurricane; only the 1917, 1924, and 1932 hurricanes were more intense. Hurricane Irma would later join that list in 2017. Hurricane Fox killed 600\u00a0people across the island, causing severe crop damages in rural areas. The hurricane also ruined 30 percent of the tomato crops on Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Across the archipelago, Fox produced wind gusts in excess of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h). Total damages reached $10\u00a0million in Cuba. Fox was the second hurricane to land during the season, after Hurricane Able struck South Carolina.[2]"

On October 21, a reconnaissance mission flew into the system, reporting sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) and gusts to 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h).[4] At the time, the system is estimated to have strengthened to Tropical Storm Fox.[3] The cyclone continued to deepen, and it reached the equivalent of a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, 120 miles (190\u00a0km) southeast of the Swan Islands, Honduras.[3] The hurricane rapidly intensified and turned north on October 23, strengthening to attain winds which correspond to a modern-day major hurricane, a storm of Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The Hurricane passed closely to Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands.[1] Late on October 24, the cyclone struck the small island of Cayo Guano del Estes in the Archipelago de los Canarreos, south of Cienfuegos.[2] Maximum sustained winds were near 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h),[3] and the island's weather station recorded a minimum pressure of 934\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg).[2] The cyclone crossed the mainland coast of Cuba west of Cienfuegos,[2] and it weakened as it crossed the island.[3] Early on October 25, Hurricane Fox entered the Atlantic Ocean.[3] It crossed central Andros and turned east across the Bahamas.[3] On October 26, the hurricane briefly re-intensified[3] as it crossed Cat Island.[5] The center became ill-defined,[5] and the cyclone quickly weakened.[3] It turned north and then took an erratic northeast turn as it weakened to a tropical storm on October 27.[3] The system gained extratropical characteristics as it merged with a polar frontal boundary,[2] and it dissipated west-southwest of Bermuda on October 28.[3]"

Hurricane Fox of 1952 was the final Atlantic tropical cyclone to be designated with this naming system, and a female list of tropical cyclone names was utilized in the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season.[24] After the stronger 1917 Pinar del R\u00edo hurricane, Hurricane Fox was Cuba's second most intense landfall until Hurricane Michelle struck the island in 2001.[3] Originally, the 1917 hurricane was believed to have been a Category\u00a03 hurricane prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis, which made Fox the second Category\u00a04 landfall after the 1932 Cuba Hurricane.[25] At the time, Fox was the fourth most intense hurricane to strike Cuba in terms of atmospheric pressure; only the 1917, 1924, and 1932 storms were stronger at one point in their life spans.[26]"

        "content": " Severe Tropical Storm Ampil, known in the Philippines as Severe Tropical Storm Inday, was a tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage in the Ryukyu Islands and East and Northeast China in late July 2018. The tenth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Ampil developed into a tropical depression east of Luzon on July\u00a017. The system gradually strengthened over the following days amid a marginally favorable environment and became a severe tropical storm late on July\u00a019 as it moved northwest. Maintaining its strength, Ampil passed over Okinawa Island from July\u00a020 to 21. Thereafter, Ampil weakened slightly while crossing the East China Sea, before making landfall in Shanghai, China, on July\u00a022. The system weakened slowly over land and degraded to a tropical depression on July\u00a023. The system turned eastwards as it continued weakening over land, diminishing to a remnant low on July\u00a025 and dissipating fully a day later over the Russian Far East. Ampil produced gusty winds across the Ryukyu Islands from July\u00a020 to 21, causing disruptions to transport and businesses. Moisture extending from Ampil also caused thunderstorms in Fukuoka. From July\u00a022 to 25, Ampil generated heavy rains across much of East and Northeast China, affecting more than 2.3\u00a0million people and causing record-breaking flooding within the watershed of the Songhua River. About 387,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Transport was severely disrupted, with 600 flights into Shanghai canceled and ferries and rail services suspended. A person in Shandong was killed by a fallen tree. About 7,200 houses were damaged or destroyed, while 169,000 hectares (420,000 acres) of cropland were damaged. Direct economic losses reached \u00a51.63\u00a0billion (US$246\u00a0million).[nb 1]"

        "content": "A broad area of disturbed weather developed within the monsoon trough on July\u00a015 roughly 1,215\u00a0km (755\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Okinawa.[2] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared that the system consolidated into a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a017.[3][nb 2] The system initially moved east-northeastwards around a ridge near the Equator, while gradually organizing amid generally favorable upper-level wind patterns and high sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F).[5] As the system was located within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) gave the depression the local name Inday at 03:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018.[6] Just hours later, the JMA stated that the depression became a tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC and named it Ampil;[3] the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) made a similar declaration six hours later.[7] The recently named tropical storm was large and asymmetric \u2013 a large rainband extended over the southern half of the system, while the low-level circulation center was exposed.[8] Intensification was slow as upper-level winds restricted outflow in Ampil's northern half, preventing thunderstorms from developing there. This left the low-level circulation elongated, hindering quicker consolidation of the system. On July\u00a019, Ampil began to turn northwestwards as a strong subtropical ridge to the north began to dominate the steering pattern.[9] Later on July\u00a019, the unfavorable upper-level winds diminished slightly and allowed thunderstorms to develop over Ampil's center of circulation, resulting in it becoming well-defined.[10] The JMA reported that Ampil became a severe tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC, as its 10-minute sustained winds increased to 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). The system's central pressure also dropped to an estimated 985\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.09\u00a0inHg).[3] Ampil then maintained this intensity for the next two days due to the limiting effect of surrounding dry air, while continuing to track northwestwards.[3][11] In the meantime, Ampil exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020,[12] and passed over Okinawa Island during the night of July\u00a020 to 21.[13] According to the JMA, weakening took place on July\u00a022 as the storm's winds decreased slightly;[3] conversely the JTWC stated that Ampil's 1-minute sustained winds increased to 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) at 00:00\u00a0UTC.[7] Around 04:30\u00a0UTC, Ampil made landfall over eastern Chongming Island in Shanghai, becoming only the third tropical cyclone to make landfall in Shanghai since 1949.[14] The system weakened slowly as it pushed inland, degrading to a tropical depression on July\u00a023. The depression turned northwards then eastwards while moving over Northeast China on July\u00a024, before degenerating to a remnant low-pressure area by 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a025. The leftover system eventually dissipated over the Russian Far East while still inland by 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a026.[3]"

Shuri Castle was also closed during a similar time period.[21][22] Major department stores across Okinawa were closed till about noon on July\u00a021.[23][24][25] Further northeast, moist air from Ampil generated thunderstorms in and around Fukuoka. A lightning strike damaged the runway at Fukuoka Airport, forcing it to close for an hour and resulting in 70 flights being canceled.

Temporary speed limits were imposed on expressways and bridges crossing the Huangpu River, while the Donghai Bridge was closed to traffic. The observation decks of Shanghai Tower and Shanghai World Financial Center were shut.[32] Elsewhere, warnings were issued in Shandong in anticipation of geologic hazards resulting from heavy rainfall.[29] When Ampil made landfall in eastern Chongming District on July\u00a022, it became the only third tropical cyclone to make landfall over Shanghai since 1949 (the other instances were in 1977 and 1989).[14] Strong winds occurred in the Zhoushan area, with a gust to 33.1\u00a0m/s (119\u00a0km/h; 74\u00a0mph) recorded in Jigu Jiao (Chinese: \u9e21\u9aa8\u7901) and a gust to 28.0\u00a0m/s (101\u00a0km/h; 63\u00a0mph) recorded in Xiaoyangshan (Chinese: \u5c0f\u6d0b\u5c71). An automated weather station on Hengsha Island recorded a rainfall total of 112.8\u00a0mm (4.44\u00a0in).[33] As Ampil tracked further inland from July\u00a022 to 25, it produced a large swath of heavy rain across East and Northeast China. Rainfall totals exceeded 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) in Rizhao, Tianjin, Chengde, and Qinhuangdao, with a peak accumulation of 324\u00a0mm (12.8\u00a0in) recorded in Qinglong County. The heavy rains caused water levels along 17 tributaries of the Songhua River to rise up to 2.01\u00a0m (6.59\u00a0ft) above the ordinary high water mark. Flooding along the Hulan River reached an all-time high; the Chaohe River recorded its largest floods since 1998. Throughout the country, Ampil affected 2.334\u00a0million people, killing one person in Shandong with a fallen tree and causing direct economic losses of \u00a51.63\u00a0billion (US$246\u00a0million).[34][35] According to statistics from the National Disaster Reduction Center, about 169,200 hectares (418,000 acres) of cropland were damaged, of which 6,300 hectares (16,000 acres) were completely lost. Approximately 500 houses collapsed and another 6,700 were damaged, while roughly 1,000 people required emergency assistance.[36]"

With a population of 2.04 billion living in South Asia, it contains a quarter (25%) of the world's population. As commonly conceptualized, the modern states of South Asia include Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan's inclusion is disputed because of its cultural, ethnic, and linguistic differences. South Asia borders East Asia to the northeast, Central Asia to the northwest, West Asia to the west and Southeast Asia to the east. Apart from Southeast Asia, Maritime South Asia is the only subregion of Asia that lies partly within the Southern Hemisphere. The British Indian Ocean Territory and two out of 26 atolls of the Maldives in South Asia lie entirely within the Southern Hemisphere. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian subcontinent and is bounded by the Indian Ocean in the south, and the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Pamir Mountains in the north.[6] Settled life emerged on the Indian subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus River Basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[7] By 1200\u00a0BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[8][9] with the Dravidian languages being supplanted in the northern and western regions.[10] By 400\u00a0BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[11] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[12] In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on South Asia's southern and western coasts.[13] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran the plains of northern India,[14] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century, and drawing the region into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[15] The Islamic Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[16] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[a][17] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning most of South Asia into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[18] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[19][20] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[21] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[22][23][24][25] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[26] The 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, a Cold War episode resulting in East Pakistan's secession,[27] was the most recent instance of a new nation being formed in the region. South Asia has a total area of 5.2 million sq.km (2 million sq.mi), which is 10% of the Asian continent.[28] The population of South Asia is estimated to be 2.04 billion[6] or about one-fourth of the world's population, making it both the most populous and the most densely populated geographical region in the world.[29] In 2022, South Asia had the world's largest populations of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, and Zoroastrians.[30] South Asia alone accounts for 90.47% of Hindus, 95.5% of Sikhs, and 31% of Muslims worldwide, as well as 35 million Christians and 25 million Buddhists.[31][32][33][34] The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic cooperation organization in the region which was established in 1985 and includes all the nations comprising South Asia.[35]"

South Asia's northern, eastern, and western boundaries vary based on definitions used, while the Indian Ocean is the southern periphery. Most of this region rests on the Indian Plate and is isolated from the rest of Asia by mountain barriers.[69][70] Much of the region consists of a peninsula in south-central Asia, rather resembling a diamond which is delineated by the Himalayas on the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakanese in the east,[71] and which extends southward into the Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea to the southwest and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast.[72][73]"

This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[77] Historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot state that the term \"Indian subcontinent\" describes a natural physical landmass in South Asia that has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia.[78] The use of the term Indian subcontinent began in the British Empire, and has been a term particularly common in its successors.[74] South Asia as the preferred term is particularly common when scholars or officials seek to differentiate this region from East Asia.[79] According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, the Indian subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia \"in more recent and neutral parlance.\"[75] This \"neutral\" notion refers to the concerns of Pakistan and Bangladesh, particularly given the recurring conflicts between India and Pakistan, wherein the dominant placement of \"India\" as a prefix before the subcontinent might offend some political sentiments.[54] However, in Pakistan, the term \"South Asia\" is considered too India-centric and was banned until 1989 after the death of Zia ul Haq.[80] This region has also been labelled as \"India\" (in its classical and pre-modern sense) and \"Greater India\".[54][71]"

Later, the Maurya Empire extended over much of South Asia in the 3rd century BCE. Buddhism spread beyond south Asia, through northwest into Central Asia. The Bamiyan Buddhas of Afghanistan and the edicts of A\u015boka suggest that the Buddhist monks spread Buddhism (Dharma) in eastern provinces of the Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther into West Asia.[101][102][103] The Theravada school spread south from India in the 3rd century BCE, to Sri Lanka, later to Southeast Asia.[104] Buddhism, by the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, was prominent in the Himalayan region, Gandhara, Hindu Kush region and Bactria.[105][106][107] From about 500 BCE through about 300 CE, the Vedic-Brahmanic synthesis or \"Hindu synthesis\" continued.[98] Classical Hindu and Sramanic (particularly Buddhist) ideas spread within South Asia, as well as outside South Asia.[108][109][110] The Gupta Empire ruled over a large part of the region between the 4th and 7th centuries, a period that saw the construction of major temples, monasteries and universities such as the Nalanda.[111][112][113] During this era, and through the 10th century, numerous cave monasteries and temples such as the Ajanta Caves, Badami cave temples, and Ellora Caves were built in South Asia.[114][115][116]"

The Ghurid Sultan Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad began a systematic war of expansion into North India in 1173.[123] He sought to carve out a principality for himself by expanding the Islamic world,[119][124] and thus laid the foundation for the Muslim kingdom that became the Delhi Sultanate.[119] Some historians chronicle the Delhi Sultanate from 1192 due to the presence and geographical claims of Mu'izz al-Din in South Asia by that time.[125] The Delhi Sultanate covered varying parts of South Asia and was ruled by a series of dynasties: Mamluk, Khalji, Tughlaq, Sayyid, and Lodi dynasties. Muhammad bin Tughlaq came to power in 1325, launched a war of expansion and the Delhi Sultanate reached it largest geographical reach over the South Asian region during his 26-year rule.[126] A Sunni Sultan, Muhammad bin Tughlaq persecuted non-Muslims such as Hindus, as well as non-Sunni Muslims such as Shia and Mahdi sects.[127][128][129] Revolts against the Delhi Sultanate sprang up in many parts of South Asia during the 14th century.[citation needed] In the northeast, the Bengal Sultanate became independent in 1346 CE. It remained in power through the early 16th century. The state religion of the sultanate was Islam.[130][131] In South India, the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire came to power in 1336 and persisted until the middle of the 16th century. It was ultimately defeated and destroyed by an alliance of the Muslim Deccan sultanates at the Battle of Talikota.[132][133] About 1526, the Punjab governor Dawlat Khan Lod\u012b reached out to the Mughal Babur and invited him to attack the Delhi Sultanate. Babur defeated and killed Ibrahim Lodi in the Battle of Panipat in 1526. The death of Ibrahim Lodi ended the Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughal Empire replaced it.[134]"

The first ruler was Babur had Turco-Mongol roots and his realm included the northwestern and Indo-Gangetic Plain regions of South Asia. Several regions of South Asia were largely under Hindu kings such as those of the Vijayanagara Empire and the Kingdom of Mewar.[135] Parts of modern Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were under local Muslim rulers, namely those of the Deccan sultanates.[136][137] The Mughal Empire continued its wars of expansion after Babur's death. With the fall of the Rajput kingdoms and Vijayanagara, its boundaries encompassed almost the entirety of the Indian subcontinent.[138] The Mughal Empire was marked by a period of artistic exchanges and a Central Asian and South Asian architecture synthesis, with remarkable buildings such as the Taj Mahal.[139][137][140] However, this time also marked an extended period of religious persecution.[141] Two of the religious leaders of Sikhism, Guru Arjan, and Guru Tegh Bahadur were arrested under orders of the Mughal emperors after their revolts and were executed when they refused to convert to Islam.[142][143][144] Religious taxes on non-Muslims called jizya were imposed. Buddhist, Hindu, and Sikh temples were desecrated. However, not all Muslim rulers persecuted non-Muslims. Akbar, a Mughal ruler for example, sought religious tolerance and abolished jizya.[145][146][147][148] The death of Aurangzeb and the collapse of the Mughal Empire, which marks the beginning of modern India, in the early 18th century, provided opportunities for the Marathas, Sikhs, Mysoreans, and Nawabs of Bengal to exercise control over large regions of the Indian subcontinent.[149][150] By the mid-18th century, India was a major proto-industrializing region.[151][137] Maritime trading between South Asia and European merchants began at the turn of the 16th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama returned to Europe. British, French, and Portuguese colonial interests struck treaties with these rulers and established their trading ports. In northwestern South Asia, a large region was consolidated into the Sikh Empire by Ranjit Singh.[152][153] After the defeat of the Nawab of Bengal and Tipu Sultan and his French allies, British traders went on to dominate much of South Asia through divide-and-rule tactics by the early 19th century. The region experienced significant de-industrialisation in its first few decades of British rule.[154] Control over the subcontinent was then transferred to the British government after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, with the British cracking down to some extent afterwards.[155] An increase of famines and extreme poverty characterised the colonial period, though railways built with British technology eventually provided crucial famine relief by increasing food distribution throughout India.[156][154] Millions of South Asians began to migrate throughout the world, impelled by the economic/labour needs and opportunities presented by the British Empire.[157][158][159] The introduction of Western political thought inspired a growing Indian intellectual movement, and so by the 20th century, British rule began to be challenged by the Indian National Congress, which sought full independence under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.[160][161] Britain, under pressure from Indian freedom fighters, increasingly gave self-rule to British India. By the 1940s, two rival camps had emerged among independence activists: those who favored a separate nation for Indian Muslims, and those who wanted a united India. As World War II raged, over 2 million Indians fought for Britain;[162] by the end of the war, Britain was greatly weakened, and thus decided to grant independence to the vast majority of South Asians in 1947,[162][163] though this coincided with the Partition of India into a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan, which resulted in significant displacement and violence and harder religious divides in the region.[164]"

The variety is influenced by not only the altitude but also by factors such as proximity to the seacoast and the seasonal impact of the monsoons. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of Indo-Gangetic plains also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges. As the Himalayas block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For the most part, the climate of the region is called the monsoon climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of jute, tea, rice, and various vegetables in this region. South Asia is largely divided into four broad climate zones:[200] Maximum relative humidity of over 80% has been recorded in Khasi and Jaintia Hills and Sri Lanka, while the area adjustment to Pakistan and western India records lower than 20%\u201330%.[200] Climate of South Asia is largely characterized by monsoons. South Asia depends critically on monsoon rainfall.[201] Two monsoon systems exist in the region:[202] The warmest period of the year precedes the monsoon season (March to mid June). In the summer the low pressures are centered over the Indus-Gangetic Plain and high wind from the Indian Ocean blows towards the center. The monsoons are the second coolest season of the year because of high humidity and cloud covering. But, at the beginning of June, the jetstreams vanish above the Tibetan Plateau, low pressure over the Indus Valley deepens and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.[200]"

In particular, Muslims of South Asia such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan use the Arabic alphabet and Persian Nastaliq. Till 1952, Muslim-majority Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) also mandated only the Nastaliq script, but after that adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali, after the Language Movement for the adoption of Bengali as the official language of the then East Pakistan. Non-Muslims of South Asia, and some Muslims in India, on the other hand, use scripts such as those derived from Brahmi script for Indo-European languages and non-Brahmi scripts for Dravidian languages and others.[246][247] The Nagari script has been the primus inter pares of the traditional South Asian scripts.[248] The Devanagari script is used for over 120 South Asian languages,[249] including Hindi,[250] Marathi, Nepali, Pali, Konkani, Bodo, Sindhi and Maithili among other languages and dialects, making it one of the most used and adopted writing systems in the world.[251] The Devanagari script is also used for classical Sanskrit texts.[249] The largest spoken language in this region is Hindustani language, followed by Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, and Punjabi.[246][247] In the modern era, new syncretic languages developed in the region such as Urdu that are used by the Muslim community of northern South Asia (particularly Pakistan and northern states of India).[252] The Punjabi language spans three religions: Islam, Hinduism, and Sikhism. The spoken language is similar, but it is written in three scripts. The Sikh use Gurmukhi alphabet, Muslim Punjabis in Pakistan use the Nastaliq script, while Hindu Punjabis in India use the Gurmukhi or N\u0101gar\u012b script. The Gurmukhi and Nagari scripts are distinct but close in their structure, but the Persian Nastaliq script is very different.[253] Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken across northern belts of the region in the Himalayan areas, often using the Tibetan script.[254] These languages are predominantly spoken in Bhutan and Nepal as well as parts of Burma and northern India in the state of Sikkim and the Ladakh region.[255] The national language of Bhutan is Dzongkha, while Lepcha, Limbu, Gurung, Magar, Rai, Newari, Tamang, Tshangla, Thakali and Sikkimese are also spoken in Bhutan, Nepal and Sikkim, and Ladakhi is spoken in Ladakh.[255] Both Buddhism and Bon are often predominant in areas where these languages are present.[255][254] Some areas in Gilgit-Baltistan also speak Balti language, however speakers write with the Urdu script.[254] The Tibetan script fell out of use in Pakistani Baltistan hundreds of years ago upon the region's adoption of Islam[254] English, with British spelling, is commonly used in urban areas and is a major economic lingua franca of South Asia (see also South Asian English).[256]"

Only 19% of children attending primary and lower secondary schools attain a minimum proficiency level in reading and mathematics.[321][322] According to a citizen-led assessment, only 48% in Indian public schools and 46% of children in Pakistan public schools could read a class two level text by the time they reached class five.[323][322] This poor quality of education in turn has contributed to some of the highest drop-out rates in the world, while over half of the students complete secondary school with acquiring requisite skills.[322] In South Asia, classrooms are teacher-centred and rote-based, while children are often subjected to corporal punishment and discrimination.[320] Different South Asian countries have different education structures. While by 2018 India and Pakistan has two of the most developed and increasingly decentralised education systems, Bangladesh still had a highly centralised system, and Nepal is in a state of transition from a centralized to a decentralized system.[319] In most South Asian countries children's education is theoretically free; the exceptions are the Maldives, where there is no constitutionally guaranteed free education, as well as Bhutan and Nepal, where fees are charged by primary schools. But parents are still faced with unmanageable secondary financial demands, including private tuition to make up for the inadequacies of the education system.[324] The larger and poorer countries in the region, like India and Bangladesh, struggle financially to get sufficient resources to sustain an education system required for their vast populations, with an added challenge of getting large numbers of out-of-school children enrolled into schools.[319] Their capacity to deliver inclusive and equitable quality education is limited by low levels of public finance for education,[320] while the smaller emerging middle-income countries like Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bhutan have been able to achieve universal primary school completion, and are in a better position to focus on quality of education.[319] Children's education in the region is also adversely affected by natural and human-made crises including natural hazards, political instability, rising extremism and civil strife that makes it difficult to deliver educational services.[320] Afghanistan and India are among the top ten countries with the highest number of reported disasters due to natural hazards and conflict. The precarious security situation in Afghanistan is a big barrier in rolling out education programmes on a national scale.[319] According to UNICEF, girls face incredible hurdles to pursue their education in the region,[320] while UNESCO estimated in 2005 that 24 million girls of primary-school age in the region were not receiving any formal education.[325][326] Between 1900 and 2005, most of the countries in the region had shown progress in girls' education with Sri Lanka and the Maldives significantly ahead of the others, while the gender gap in education has widened in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Bangladesh made the greatest progress in the region in the period increasing girls' secondary school enrolment from 13 percent to 56 percent in ten years.[327][328] With about 21 million students in 700 universities and 40 thousand colleges India had one of the largest higher education systems in the world in 2011, accounting for 86 percent of all higher-level students in South Asia. Bangladesh (two million) and Pakistan (1.8\u00a0million) stood at distant second and third positions in the region. In Nepal (390 thousand) and Sri Lanka (230 thousand) the numbers were much smaller. Bhutan with only one university and Maldives with none hardly had between them about 7000 students in higher education in 2011. The gross enrolment ratio in 2011 ranged from about 10 percent in Pakistan and Afghanistan to above 20 percent in India, much below the global average of 31 percent.[329]"

Their attacks on immunization teams have claimed 78 lives since December 2012.[333] The World Bank estimates that India is one of the highest ranking countries in the world for the number of children suffering from malnutrition. The prevalence of underweight children in India is among the highest in the world and is nearly double that of Sub Saharan Africa with dire consequences for mobility, mortality, productivity, and economic growth.[334] According to the World Bank, 64% of South Asians lived in rural areas in 2022.[335] In 2008, about 75% of South Asia's poor lived in rural areas and most relied on agriculture for their livelihood[336] according to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation. In 2021, approximately 330 million people in the region were malnourished.[337] A 2015 report says that Nepal reached both the WFS target as well as MDG and is moving towards bringing down the number of undernourished people to less than 5% of the population.[308] Bangladesh reached the MDG target with the National Food Policy framework\u00a0\u2013 with only 16.5% of the population undernourished. In India, the malnourished comprise just over 15 percent of the population. While the number of malnourished people in the neighborhood has shown a decline over the last 25 years, the number of under-nourished in Pakistan displays an upward trend. There were 28.7 million hungry in Pakistan in the 1990s\u00a0\u2013 a number that has steadily increased to 41.3\u00a0million in 2015 with 22% of the population malnourished. Approximately 194.6\u00a0million people are undernourished in India, which accounts for the highest number of people suffering from hunger in any single country.[308][338] The 2006 report stated, \"the low status of women in South Asian countries and their lack of nutritional knowledge are important determinants of high prevalence of underweight children in the region.\" Corruption and the lack of initiative on the part of the government has been one of the major problems associated with nutrition in India. Illiteracy in villages has been found to be one of the major issues that need more government attention. The report mentioned that although there has been a reduction in malnutrition due to the Green Revolution in South Asia, there is concern that South Asia has \"inadequate feeding and caring practices for young children.\"[339]"

        "content": "India is a secular federative parliamentary republic with the prime minister as head of government. With the most populous functional democracy in world[341] and the world's longest written constitution,[342][343][344] India has been stably sustaining the political system it adopted in 1950 with no regime change except that by a democratic election. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer establishments. Since the formation of its republic abolishing British law, it has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active Supreme Court, and a largely independent press.[345] India leads region in Democracy Index. It has a multi-party system in its internal regional politics[346] whereas alternative transfer of powers to alliances of Indian left-wing and right-wing political parties in national government provide it with characteristics of a two-party state.[347] India has been facing notable internal religious conflicts and separatism however consistently becoming more and more stable with time. The foundation of Pakistan lies in the Pakistan movement which began in colonial India based on Islamic nationalism. Pakistan is a federal parliamentary Islamic republic and was the world's first country to adopt Islamic republic system to modify its republican status under its otherwise secular constitution in 1956. Pakistan's governance is one of the most conflicted in the world. The military rule and the unstable governments in Pakistan have become a concern for the South Asian region. Out of 22 appointed Pakistani Prime ministers, none of them have ever been able to complete a full term in office.[348] The nature of Pakistani politics can be characterized as a multi-party system. The unitary semi-presidential constitutional republic of Sri Lanka is the oldest sustained democracy in Asia. Tensions between the Sinhalese and the Tamils led to the emergence of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a separatist Sri Lankan Tamil militant group and the outbreak of the Sri Lankan Civil War. The war, which ended in 2009, would undermine the country's stability for more than two and a half decades.[349] Sri Lanka, however, has been leading the region in HDI with per capita GDP well ahead of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka has a multi-party system, and the political situation in Sri Lanka has been dominated by an increasingly assertive ideology of Sinhalese nationalism. Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic. The law of Bangladesh defines it as Islamic[350] as well as secular.[351] The nature of Bangladeshi politics can be characterized as a multi-party system. Bangladesh is a unitary state and parliamentary democracy.[352] Bangladesh also stands out as one of the few Muslim-majority democracies. \"It is a moderate and generally secular and tolerant \u2014 though sometimes this is getting stretched at the moment \u2014 alternative to violent extremism in a very troubled part of the world\", said Dan Mozena, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh's legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, analysts say. Experts say that the rise in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.[353] By the 18th century, the Hindu Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. Hinduism became the state religion and Hindu laws were formulated as national policies. A small oligarchic group of Gorkha region based Hindu Thakuri and Chhetri political families dominated the national politics, military and civic affairs until the abdication of the Rana dynasty regime and establishment of Parliamentary democratic system in 1951, which was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. It was the last Hindu state in world before becoming a secular democratic republic in 2008. The country's modern development suffered due to the various significant events like the 1990 Nepalese revolution, 1996\u20132006 Nepalese Civil War, April 2015 Nepal earthquake and the 2015 Nepal blockade by India leading to the grave 2015\u20132017 Nepal humanitarian crisis. There is also a huge turnover in the office of the Prime Minister of Nepal leading to serious concerns of political instability. The country has been ranked one of the poor countries in terms of GDP per capita but it has one of the lowest levels of hunger problem in South Asia.[307] When the stability of the country ensured as late as recent, it has also made considerable progress in development indicators outpacing many other South Asian states. Afghanistan has been a unitary theocratic Islamic emirate since 2021. Afghanistan has been suffering from one of the most unstable regimes on earth as a result of multiple foreign invasions, civil wars, revolutions and terrorist groups. Persisting instability for decades have left the country's economy stagnated and torn and it remains one of the most poor and least developed countries on the planet, leading to the influx of Afghan refugees to neighboring countries like Iran.[262] Bhutan is a Buddhist state with a constitutional monarchy. The country has been ranked as the least corrupt and most peaceful country in the region, with the most economic freedom, in 2016. Maldives is a unitary presidential republic with Sunni Islam strictly as the state religion."

While in East Asia, regional trade accounts for 50% of total trade, it accounts for only a little more than 5% in South Asia.[378] Populism is a general characteristic of internal politics of India.[379]"

Over the subsequent days the system produced a broad area of convection, which began to show signs of organization on May 29.[1] Early on June 1, the disturbance became better defined,[2] and shortly thereafter the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified it as a tropical depression while located 460\u00a0mi (740\u00a0km) southwest of Acapulco.[1] At the time, the depression maintained good outflow aloft; it was forecast to strengthen into a minimal hurricane after three days.[2] Based on a combination of ship data and Dvorak intensity estimates, the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Agatha on June 2.[3] For the first two days of its duration, Agatha steered toward the north while embedded within a deep southerly flow.[1] Steady intensification continued, and the storm reached winds of 50\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) six hours after being upgraded as it neared the coast of Mexico.[4] By the afternoon of June 2, the center exhibited an elongated appearance within its associated central dense overcast, a large area of organized mid-tropospheric convection.[5] Around 1800 UTC that same day, the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg).[6] Maintaining its peak intensity for 30 hours, Agatha gradually decelerated as it passed within 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) southwest of the Mexican coast.[1] Although specialists at the NHC had anticipated a Category 1-hurricane landfall on the territory,[7] the storm defied predictions and stayed at sea.[6] The center of the storm promptly became ill-defined on infrared satellite imagery, simultaneously recurving to the west.[8] Agatha continued to degenerate quickly into the morning of June 4, with a ragged appearance observed on satellite imagery.[9] By 0600 UTC June 5, the storm was downgraded back into tropical depression status prior to dissipating the next day.[1]"

        "content": " Hurricane Uleki, also referred as Typhoon Uleki, was a long-lived tropical cyclone in August\u2013September 1988 that had minimal effects on land. Originating from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone in late-August, Uleki was identified as a tropical depression well to the southeast of Hawaii on August\u00a028. Steady organization ensued as it moved west, becoming a tropical storm on August\u00a030 and a hurricane on August\u00a031. Rapid intensification took place thereafter and the storm reached its peak intensity on September\u00a02 as a Category\u00a03 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. hurricane hunters investigating the cyclone found peak winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 957 mbar (hPa; 28.26\u00a0inHg). Thereafter, Uleki stalled for two days to the southwest of Hawaii, resulting in heavy surf across the state. The dangerous swells killed two people on Oahu. Unfavorable environmental conditions caused weakening of the hurricane by September\u00a04 as it resumed a west-northwest course away from Hawaii. Conditions later became favorable and Uleki acquired winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0mph) on September\u00a07, constituting its secondary peak. The hurricane crossed the International Date Line on September\u00a08 and was reclassified as typhoon. Remaining well away from land, the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm by September\u00a012. Gradually turning north and later east, the degrading cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone four days later and ultimately dissipated on September\u00a017 near the International Date Line."

        "content": "In late-August\u00a01988, increased convective activity was noted along the Intertropical Convergence Zone by forecasters at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). An area of low pressure subsequently developed within this disturbance and was designated as Tropical Depression One-C at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028. Upon classification, the depression was situated roughly 800\u00a0mi (1,300\u00a0km) southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii and moving west-northwest. Steady intensification ensued over the following day with the system attaining gale-force winds by 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, at which time it was assigned the name Uleki.[nb 1] The storm later attained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a031 and was dubbed a hurricane as it passed 350\u00a0mi (560\u00a0km) south of Hilo. Thereafter, Uleki underwent a sudden period of rapid intensification and achieved major hurricane status later that day.[nb 2] After reaching this strength, Uleki's forward motion gradually lessened and eventually almost ceased altogether on September\u00a01 as upper-level steering currents collapsed.[2] With the hurricane situated to the southwest of the Hawaiian Islands, Hurricane Hunters conducted several weather reconnaissance missions into the storm. On September\u00a02, they found maximum surface winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 957 mbar (hPa; 28.26\u00a0inHg); this corresponded to the peak intensity of Uleki.[2] At the time, Uleki displayed a well-organized, tight circulation.[1] The hurricane meandered in the same general area over the next two days, executing several small loops, with a slight northward drift.[2] During this time, its circulation increased in coverage but became less-organized as weakening ensued.[1] Increased wind shear and restricted outflow took their toll on the hurricane.[3] The cyclone's winds dropped to 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04 as it resumed its west-northwest track under the influence of a subtropical ridge away from the Hawaiian Islands.[2][3] Uleki passed roughly halfway between Johnston Atoll and the French Frigate Shoals on September\u00a05. By September\u00a07, the weakened trend halted and environmental conditions favored reintensification. As Uleki neared the International Date Line, it regained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08, the CPHC transferred warning responsibility of Uleki to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the storm was subsequently referred to as a typhoon. Transfer of warnings occurred when the storm was at 178\u00b0W rather than at the dateline, where the boundary between the Central and West Pacific basins exists, for unknown reasons. Three hours later Uleki made its closest approach to Midway Atoll, passing 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) to the south. Shortly thereafter the system crossed the International Date Line and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also began advising on the system.[2][4] The JMA estimated Uleki to have had a pressure of 945\u00a0mbar (945\u00a0hPa; 27.9\u00a0inHg) at this time; however, this value was derived from satellite estimates rather than direct measurements.[4] Uleki maintained this strength through September\u00a010 as it continued on its west-northwest course. On that day, the typhoon again entered a region of weak steering currents between two anticyclones within the subtropical ridge. A trough approaching from the west was forecast to prompt Uleki to turn east; however, the typhoon maintained a general northwest motion in a stair-stepped fashion. Increasing wind shear and cooler air soon imparted weakening,[3] and Uleki degraded to a tropical storm by September\u00a012.[4] Continued effects from shear stripped the cyclone of all deep convection, and by September\u00a014 only a band of cirrus clouds remained in association with Uleki. The JTWC issued their final warning on the system at 00:00\u00a0UTC that day accordingly.[3] The JMA maintained the system as a tropical depression as the former typhoon began turning to the east. Uleki later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a016 as it accelerated to the east. The system dissipated the following day near the International Date Line, far from any major landmasses.[4]"

High surf advisories were raised for all islands as well.[1] Following Uleki's turn to the west on September\u00a05, the tropical storm watches were discontinued.[5] The storm's erratic movement proved to be troublesome for forecasters and they continuously warned residents to be cautious and alert should the storm double-back to the state. On September\u00a04, lifeguards at Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana Beach rescued 19\u00a0people caught in 5 to 6\u00a0ft (1.5 to 1.8\u00a0m) swells. Further north in Oahu, two people drowned after being caught in rough waters.[2][6] The storm moved roughly halfway between the French Frigate Shoals and Johnston Island on September\u00a05 with no adverse effects in either region due to its weakened state.[2] On September\u00a07, the 300\u00a0residents of Midway Atoll and United States Coast Guard personnel stationed on Kure Atoll prepared for possible hurricane-force winds from the storm.[7] Hurricane Uleki ultimately passed 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) south of Midway Atoll and produced some coastal flooding from increased surf. Some breaking waves spilled onto the runway at Henderson Field.[2]"

        "content": " The 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was the last season that tropical cyclones were not publicly labeled by India Meteorological Department (IMD). Also was mostly focused in the Bay of Bengal, where six of the seven depressions developed. The remaining system was a tropical cyclone that developed in the Arabian Sea in November, which was also the only system that did not affect land. There were three cyclonic storms, which was below the average of 4\u20136. Only one storm formed before the start of the monsoon season in June, although it was also the most notable. On May\u00a010, a depression formed in the central Bay of Bengal, and within a few days became a very severe cyclonic storm. After it stalled, it drew moisture from the southwest to produce severe flooding across Sri Lanka, killing 254\u00a0people and becoming the worst floods there since 1947. Damage on the island totaled $135\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD). The storm eventually made landfall in Myanmar on May\u00a019. It is possible that the storm contributed to a deadly heat wave in India due to shifting air currents. In late July, a monsoon depression moved across much of India, and another monsoon disturbance persisted off the coast of Pakistan. The interaction between the two systems resulted in heavy rainfall across the region, flooding dozens of villages. Monsoonal rainfall killed 285\u00a0people between Pakistan and India in the summer of 2003. In late August, another monsoon depression moved across northeastern India. A depression that struck Andhra Pradesh in India killed 21\u00a0people in early October. Later that month, a tropical depression crossed Thailand from the western Pacific Ocean, contributing to ongoing flooding that killed 19. Once in the Indian Ocean, this system struck southeastern India without causing much damage. The last system of the year was a cyclonic storm that struck southeastern India in December, killing 81\u00a0people and causing $28\u00a0million in damage (2003\u00a0USD)."

        "content": "There were seven depressions throughout the season, of which three attained cyclonic storm status. One of the cyclonic storms formed before the start of the monsoon season, two depressions formed during the monsoon season from June to September, and the remaining systems formed after September.[1] The number of depressions was similar or greater than that of the previous three years.[2] However, the total of 3\u00a0cyclonic storms was below the average of 5.4.[3] In May\u00a02004, seven of the eight members of the World Meteorological Organization panel on tropical cyclones for the North Indian Ocean met in Colombo, Sri Lanka to review the season. During the meeting, the panel announced the first list of tropical cyclone names to be used in the basin for the following season. The panel noted the increasing frequency of deadly natural disasters in the region, such as the floods that affected Sri Lanka in May 2003 from a cyclone. One of the panel's goals was increased coordination between the countries in the region. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) in New Delhi served as the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center,[2] although the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also issued warnings for the region in an unofficial capacity.[4] The IMD utilized satellite data from EUMETSAT to track cyclones, as well as radars from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India.[2] There were several other monsoon disturbances that affected various countries in the region, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Oman.[2] On July\u00a027, during the monsoon season, an area of convection exited from the coast of Pakistan. On the next day, the thunderstorms organized around the center, prompting the Pakistan Meteorological Department to classify the system as a monsoon depression. The IMD operationally classified the system as a depression on July\u00a029,[5] although it was dropped during the agency's annual report.[1] The system weakened into a remnant low on July\u00a030.[5] The system drew moisture from another depression that had moved across India from the Bay of Bengal, bringing three days of heavy rainfall to Karachi, Pakistan.[6] Badin in southeastern Pakistan recorded 292\u00a0mm (11.5\u00a0in) of rainfall in 24\u00a0hours. The rainfall extended into northwestern India, and in Gujarat, a station received more than its annual rainfall during the deluge. Flooding from the heavy rainfall destroyed widespread crops and flooded dozens of villages, and ongoing rains persisted throughout the summer, killing 285\u00a0people in the two countries.[7]"

Initially favorable conditions allowed the system to steadily intensify while moving northwestward, reaching peak maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) on May\u00a013. This made it a very severe cyclonic storm according to the IMD. The storm later drifted northward and later to the east in the central Bay of Bengal, although increased wind shear induced weakening into a deep depression. The system eventually began a steady northeast track, bringing it ashore in western Myanmar on May\u00a019 as a re-intensified cyclonic storm. It dissipated shortly thereafter over land, and was no longer observable on satellite imagery by May\u00a020.[1][8][9] Early and later in its duration, the storm brought rainfall to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[1] Although the storm never passed within 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) of the island,[10] the cyclone produced torrential rainfall across southwest Sri Lanka after it stalled in the central Bay of Bengal. The storm drew moisture from the southwest that coalesced in the mountainous portion of the island.[10] A station at Ratnapura recorded 366.1\u00a0mm (14.41\u00a0in) of rainfall in 18\u00a0hours on May\u00a017, including 99.8\u00a0mm (3.93\u00a0in) in one hour. This followed a period of regular rainfall in the first 15\u00a0days of May across the region.[11] The rains caused flooding and landslides in southwestern Sri Lanka that destroyed 24,750\u00a0homes and damaged 32,426\u00a0others,[12] leaving about 800,000\u00a0people homeless.[13] Overall damage totaled about $29\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD),[2] mostly to roads and buildings,[11] and there were 254\u00a0deaths.[14] This made it the worst floods on the island since 1947.[15] The storm also drew moisture away from India, which possibly contributed to a heat wave that killed 1,200\u00a0people,[1][16] and dropped heavy rainfall in Myanmar.[17]"

Moving northwestward, the system quickly intensified into a deep depression,[1] with peak winds estimated at 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). Late on July\u00a025, the system made landfall north of Balasore in Odisha state.[18] It progressed inland across India, weakening to depression status but remaining a distinct system. On July\u00a028, the depression degenerated into a remnant low over Rajasthan in northwestern India, later merging with a heat low. Rainfall associated with the system mostly occurred in the southwestern periphery, with a peak of 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) at Kendrapara; there was little damage.[1] Rainfall also spread into Bangladesh.[2]"

The next day, the circulation entered the Bay of Bengal after weakening over land, passing near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[20] On October\u00a026, the IMD began classifying the system as a depression.[1] The convection gradually reorganized as the system turned to the northwest, prompting the JTWC to upgrade it to a minimal tropical storm on October\u00a027.[20] On the same day, the IMD upgraded it to deep depression status. The system made landfall between Visakhapatnam and Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh on October\u00a028, and dissipated the next day.[1] While crossing Thailand, the depression produced heavy rainfall reaching 127.7\u00a0mm (5.03\u00a0in) at Hua Hin over a 24\u2011hour period. Ongoing monsoonal flooding in the country forced thousands of people to evacuate their houses.[20] About 22,000\u00a0cattle were killed, and large areas of farmlands were inundated.

The storm dropped heavy rainfall on the island that caused flooding and road washouts. On July\u00a018, the storm struck Belize and later moved across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Initially it was believed that the storm continued into Mexico and dissipated while another storm formed to its northeast, but it was discovered in 2012 that the storm followed one continuous track. On July\u00a023, the storm struck southeastern Texas at its peak intensity of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). It moved inland and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Turning eastward, the storm dropped torrential rainfall in eastern Texas and western Louisiana, peaking at 21.3\u00a0in (540\u00a0mm) in Logansport, Louisiana. Several stations reported record rainfall, including Shreveport, Louisiana where its 24\u2011hour amount remained the highest daily total as of 2008. High rains left about $1.5\u00a0million[nb 1] in crop damage between two Texas counties. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, forcing evacuations and road closures."

That day, ships in the region confirmed the presence of a closed circulation. The depression was assessed to have intensified into a tropical storm at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a016, before passing just south of Jamaica later that day. After affecting the island, the storm turned to the west-southwest, reaching peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) early on July\u00a018. Later that day, a ship reported a pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg), which was adjusted to 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg) to compensate a bias in the ship's barometer. Around 1500\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018, the storm made landfall near Belize City, British Honduras, at its peak intensity.[1] After moving ashore, the storm quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Late on July\u00a019, it emerged into the Bay of Campeche.[nb 3] It turned to the northwest due to a ridge moving eastward,[3] and the system re-intensified into a tropical storm on July\u00a021. At around 0800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a023, the storm moved ashore on Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas with winds of about 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h). The storm again weakened to a tropical depression shortly after landfall, before turning to the north and north-northeast. On July\u00a024, the cyclone began interacting with a cold front, and became extratropical.[1] It tracked slowly eastward across eastern Texas and northern Louisiana due to a high pressure area to the north.[4] It later moved along the Mississippi River, and early on July\u00a027, the front absorbed the depression along the border of Arkansas and Mississippi.[1]"

Some areas received 5.9\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) in as little as six hours, and about 50,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (130,000\u00a0km2) reported 10.4\u00a0in (260\u00a0mm).

Logansport also reported a 24\u2011hour total of 18\u00a0in (460\u00a0mm), which set the record for the highest daily rainfall total there in July.[8] A secondary rainfall maxima of 19.4\u00a0in (490\u00a0mm) was observed in Shreveport,[9] of which 12.4\u00a0in (310\u00a0mm) of rain fell in 24\u00a0hours; this was the highest daily total on record for the site, and remains the highest as of 2008.[10] Alexandria also broke its 24\u2011hour rainfall record in July with a total of 9.75\u00a0in (248\u00a0mm) on July\u00a025.[8] Heavy rains spread into southern Arkansas and northwestern Mississippi.[3] High rains in eastern Texas, totaling over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm), flooded roads in Shelby and Panola counties; damage in the two counties collectively totaled $1.5\u00a0million. Storm-related flooding washed out a bridge in Henderson and portions of the Santa Fe Railway line between Carthage and Longview.[4] Five people required rescue after being trapped in a fast-moving river.[11] The rains in the region were considered the heaviest in 17\u00a0years, and leaving severe damage to corn, cotton, and watermelon crops.[4] Similarly, the floods damaged cotton and other crops in northern Louisiana, totaling several million dollars in losses. The rains caused many streams to exceed their banks,[9] including one creek near Converse that flooded roads and railways.[8] The floods forced families to evacuate in low-lying areas of northern Louisiana.[11] The rainfall in Shreveport caused the worst floods related to a tropical cyclone on record.[12] While the storm was dropping heavy rainfall, it produced thunderstorms and gusty winds along the Texas and Louisiana coastlines.[9] A severe thunderstorm related to the storm damaged roofs and windows in Alexandria, Louisiana.[8]"

Because of the extreme heat, working patterns changed in Lancashire, with work beginning at dawn, around 4:30\u00a0am and finishing around midday, to avoid the hottest part of the day in the quarrying industry there. Fatalities became common and newspapers such as The Times ran Deaths by heat columns as temperatures continued to rise. The heat also caused indirect deaths, by melting the asphalt on roads, causing numerous accidents.[6] By the beginning of August, even the health of country people was being adversely affected with stifling, humid nights, meaning food spoiled very quickly without refrigeration and sewage spilled out. Also in August, striking became common, most notably in the Victoria and Albert Docks, where the entire workforce of 5,000 people walked out, because of the intolerable heat, meaning the whole area came to a standstill.[6]"

Again, the effects were felt around mid July, when early harvests were taken in and fires began to break out, along railway tracks in Ascot and gorse around Newbury. By the end of July, the heat and lack of rain had begun to affect agriculture. There was a shortage of grass for cattle as pastures turned brown from drought. This forced farmers to raise the price of milk, to compensate for the lack of production. On 28 July trees and some rare plants had begun to wither and die with the lack of water in the soil, even in shaded areas all around the country. By August, wells, water pumps and water supplies had begun to run completely dry. This led to the stopping of activity in farming and pasture in Essex and the closing of wool mills in Bradford, each an important industry in its area.[6] An unusual impact of the hot and dry 1911 summer was seen in the County Championship of 1911, where Warwickshire's narrow win was the only time between 1890 and 1935 where the Championship was not won by one of the \"Big Six\" of Yorkshire, Surrey, Kent, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire and Middlesex. The unusually hot and dry weather created extremely fast pitches that suited Warwickshire's pace bowlers Foster and Field and camouflaged their deficiencies in batting and spin bowling on wet pitches.[7]"

Forming out of an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave on August\u00a011, Ana briefly attained tropical storm intensity on August\u00a012 before weakening back to a depression. The following day, the system degenerated into a non-convective remnant low as it tracked westward. On August\u00a014, the depression regenerated roughly 1,075\u00a0mi (1,730\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands. Early on August\u00a015, the storm re-attained tropical storm status, at which time it was named Ana. After reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1,003\u00a0mbar (1,003\u00a0hPa; 29.6\u00a0inHg), the storm began to weaken again due to increasing levels of wind shear and the unusually fast movement of Ana. In post-storm analysis, it was discovered that Ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on August\u00a016, before reaching any landmasses.[1] Numerous tropical storm watches were issued for the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic between August\u00a015 and 17. Several islands took minor precautions for the storm, including St. Croix which evacuated 40 residents from flood-prone areas ahead of the storm. In the Dominican Republic, officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters. Impact from Ana was minimal, mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall. In Puerto Rico, up to 2.76\u00a0in (70\u00a0mm) of rain was reported, causing street flooding and forcing the evacuation of three schools."

        "content": "On August\u00a09, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave associated with a small area of convective activity between the Cape Verde Islands and the western coast of Africa.[2] The system eventually spawned an area of low pressure as it tracked towards the west.[3] After slowly organising for a few days, the NHC reported early on August 11, that the system had developed into a tropical depression. The system at this time was located about 280\u00a0mi (450\u00a0km), west of the Cape Verde Islands.[4] The depression developed deep convection around the center of circulation and continued to track generally towards the west in response to a mid-level subtropical ridge to the north.[5] The depression was expected to gradually intensify as it moved over marginally warm sea surface temperatures and into an area of low wind shear; however it was anticipated that dry air would hamper the depressions chances of intensifying further.[6] By August\u00a012, the NHC reported that Tropical Depression Two was near tropical storm intensity after a burst of deep convection over the center. At this point, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm;[7] however, in a post-storm analysis, it was determined that the system had attained tropical storm-force winds, peaking at 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) for 12\u00a0hours on August\u00a012.[1] Several hours later, the system became disorganized due to increased wind shear.[8] By the afternoon of August\u00a013, the system had weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around the center for 24\u00a0hours. At this time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the system but noted that there was the possibility of regeneration.[9] On August\u00a014, roughly 24\u00a0hours after degenerating into a remnant low, convection began to redevelop over the system.[10] Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance plane deployed dropsondes into the system. They found that the system was regenerating[11] and shortly after, the NHC began re-issuing advisories on the depression when it was located roughly 1,075\u00a0mi (1,730\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands.[12] The depression continued to track westward in response to an upper-level high over the north Atlantic.[13] Early on August\u00a015, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, giving it the name Ana as deep convection developed around the center of circulation.[14] Later that day, wind shear caused convection to become displaced from the circulation, exposing the center of Ana again.[15] By August\u00a016, the forward motion of Ana began to increase, and the storm quickly entered a region of dry, stable air.[16] By the afternoon, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission did not find any evidence of tropical storm-force winds, resulting in Ana being downgraded to a tropical depression.[17] It was determined in post-storm analysis, that Ana had degenerated into a tropical wave shortly afterwards, and was no longer a tropical cyclone.[1] Several hours later, the system redeveloped convection as it raced towards the west-northwest at 26\u00a0mph (42\u00a0km/h).[18] Early on August\u00a017, radar imagery from Guadeloupe and San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a system without a closed, low-level circulation. Despite this, the NHC continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery.[19] Later that day, a final reconnaissance plane flew into the storm and did not find a low-level circulation. Following this, the NHC stated that Ana had dissipated off the coast of Puerto Rico, despite having already degenerated into a tropical wave the previous day.[1] The remnants of Ana were once more monitored for signs of regeneration, but land interaction with Hispaniola and Cuba destroyed any chance of redevelopment.[20]"

Several ships were moved to Simpson Bay Lagoon where waves are generally small.[21] In St. Kitts, officials evacuated 40 families in flood-prone areas to shelters ahead of the storm.[22] On August\u00a017, the National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico issued an Urban and Small Stream Flood Advisory for all of the eastern municipalities on the island.[23] Flights in the area were delayed by several hours to avoid the depression.[24] In the Dominican Republic, officials posted flood alerts for 12 provinces as the remnants of Ana were forecast to produce up to 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) of rain in the country.[25] General Luna Paulino of the civil army activated relief agencies ahead of the storm and notified residents of possible mandatory evacuations. Officials inspected the dams threatened by the storm to protect several towns and villages.[26] Emergency officials stated that roughly 35,000 personnel were on standby in case of a disaster. Shelters were also prepped throughout the country; however, these were not opened and the residents who had voluntarily evacuated had returned home by the afternoon of August\u00a017.[27] In nearby Haiti, officials placed the country under yellow alert as the remnants of Ana could produce heavy rainfall over mountainous areas.[28] In St. Thomas, sustained winds reached 28\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h) and gusts peaked at 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[29] In Puerto Rico, rainfall was limited due to the storms' fast motion, triggering minor flooding but little damage.[30] A maximum of 2.76\u00a0in (70\u00a0mm) of rain fell in R\u00edo Grande.[31] The rains caused the R\u00edo Fajardo to rise, resulting in the issuance of an alert as officials warned it could overflow its banks. Several streets were temporarily shut down due to flooding, including one tunnel, and three schools had to be evacuated. Throughout the island, roughly 6,000 people were left without power as numerous branches were snapped off trees and knocked down power lines.[29] There were also reports of waterspouts and tornadoes associated with Ana in Puerto Rico.[32] Winds on the island gusted up to 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h).[33] The remnants of Ana produced widespread rainfall across Hispaniola; however, there were no reports of damage from the system.[34]"

The second named storm of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Beth's genesis was impeded by a cold environment surrounding the storm. However, as it continued on its northeastward course, it achieved fully tropical characteristics and peaked as a modest Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. The cyclone struck Nova Scotia on August 16 before dissipating shortly after. Beth produced substantial precipitation, and the resultant flooding inflicted severe damage to infrastructure and crops."

It became a surface low by the next day and acquired the characteristics of a tropical cyclone; it is officially stated to have become a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on August 10. The depression slowly advanced northeastward within a relatively cold environment, and as such, it did not intensify for several days. The system turned more toward the east as it approached the coast of North Carolina, at which time its structure became conducive to further development. On August 14, the depression was declared a tropical storm and assigned the name Beth following recent data from a reconnaissance aircraft.[1][2] Several hundred miles off the U.S. East Coast, Beth accelerated somewhat \u2013 reaching forward speeds of up to 19\u00a0mph (31\u00a0km/h) as it resumed a northeastward course. Its minimum central pressure deepened to 990 millibars (29\u00a0inHg), and correspondingly, maximum sustained winds increased. In response, the cyclone was recognized as a Category 1 hurricane. It continued to mature as it passed east of Cape Cod, achieving peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 977\u00a0mb (28.9\u00a0inHg). Subsequently, the hurricane weakened slightly while nearing Nova Scotia. On August 16, it made landfall near Copper Lake before crossing Cape Breton Island. Shortly thereafter, Beth was swept up by a nearby cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[1][2]"

The heavy precipitation throughout the country triggered severe flooding, stranding hundreds of travelers. The mayor of  Dartmouth reported that the area was a \"disaster\", as 500 homes were reportedly inundated. Antigonish also experienced significant flooding; waters there approached the top of parking meters.[5] Impacted crops in the region included cereal grain, corn, and tobacco, whose inundated fields resembled vast lakes.[6] Transport suffered severely: several main roads, including part of the Trans-Canada Highway and Nova Scotia Highway 102, in northeastern Nova Scotia received flood damage and were temporarily blocked off.[7] Additionally, the rising waters washed out several bridges in the region and swept away automobiles. Railways were covered by water, forcing trains to suspend their operation.[3] Drinking water in Dartmouth was contaminated due to excessive runoff into Lake Antigonish,[4] and a trailer park in Antigonish flooded, prompting 600 residents to evacuate.[8] Overall monetary damage from Beth is estimated at between $3.5 million and US$5.1 million.[4] One person was indirectly killed by the hurricane in a traffic accident induced by heavy rain.[5]"

The ninth system of the season, Haruna developed in the Mozambique Channel in the middle of February 2013 between Mozambique and southwestern Madagascar. Initially moving northward over Mozambique, the disturbance later moved slowly southward, gradually strengthening into the eighth named storm of the season and later into an intense tropical cyclone. The M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office in R\u00e9union (MFR) \u2013 the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in the basin[1] \u2013 estimated the cyclone attained peak 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph). Haruna made landfall near Morombe in southwestern Madagascar on February\u00a022. It weakened significantly while crossing the country, and MFR discontinued advisories on February\u00a024 after the storm had emerged into the Indian Ocean. Before Haruna struck Madagascar, a pre-existing system produced deadly flooding, and when the cyclone crossed the country, it added additional rainfall to the region. Flooding was worst in Toliara where a dyke burst, flooding much of the town and leaving residents without water or power. Many villages in southwestern Madagascar lost access to clean water, prompting various international agencies to deploy teams to decontaminate wells. Haruna destroyed 7,402\u00a0houses, which left 13,882\u00a0people homeless. Most of the displaced people were able to leave their shelters by early April. The cyclone damaged rice and maize crops along the coast, although there were extended residual effects when a locust outbreak occurred, affecting half of Madagascar's farmlands by July 2013. Throughout Madagascar, Haruna killed 26\u00a0people and injured 127 directly, and there were outbreaks of various diseases in the storm's aftermath."

        "content": "In the middle of February, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted in the Mozambique Channel. It had an associated circulation and rainbands to the east of the center,[2] and was related to the monsoon trough.[3] The system was located within an area of warm sea surface temperatures of over 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F) and steadily decreasing wind shear. A ridge to the south caused the system to initially track to the north.[2] By February\u00a016, the system had moved over Mozambique and turned to the east, although by that time it had become better organized with the convection wrapping into the center.[4] Subsequently, the system moved southward due to a weakness in the ridge, with conditions favorable for tropical cyclogenesis such as low wind shear and good divergence.[5] On February\u00a018, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert,[6] and at 1200\u00a0UTC that day, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 09.[7] Upon being classified, the disturbance had a broad circulation that was difficult to locate, with moderate convection in its eastern periphery.[7] The thunderstorms organized further, and MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression at 0000\u00a0UTC on February\u00a019.[8] Three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S,[9] and at 0600\u00a0UTC that day, MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm after an advanced scatterometer indicated winds of over 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph); as a result, the National Weather Service of Madagascar gave it the name Haruna. By that time, the circulation had become better organized with increased rainbands,[10] and with an anticyclone aloft, the storm developed well-defined outflow.[11] The structure of Haruna continued to become more symmetrical with a large radius of maximum winds, developing a ragged eye early on February\u00a020. Based on the improved appearance, MFR upgraded Haruna to a severe tropical storm at 0000\u00a0UTC that day.[12] About 12\u00a0hours later, the agency upgraded Haruna further to tropical cyclone status, with 10\u00a0minute winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[13] That day, an approaching trough weakened the ridge to the south, causing the cyclone to slow and move erratically.[14] While Haruna was approaching the southwestern coast of Madagascar, it developed a 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) wide eye, and the eyewall passed over Europa Island. Initially, MFR estimated that the storm would intensify to intense tropical cyclone status, and the agency assessed that Haruna reached 10\u00a0minute winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) on February\u00a020.[15] The next day, JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[16] In contrast, MFR estimated at that time that the cyclone had peaked when the eyewall thunderstorms warmed,[17] followed by the eye becoming less organized and the winds decreasing.[18] While moving slowly to the east-southeast, Haruna re-intensified early on February\u00a022 to its previous MFR peak intensity.[19] At around 0230\u00a0UTC that day, the cyclone made landfall about 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) south of Morombe in southwestern Madagascar.[20] Haruna quickly weakened below cyclone status,[20] and while over land it accelerated to the southeast.[21] On February\u00a023, Haruna weakened to an overland depression with 10\u00a0minute winds of around 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph).[22] A few hours later, the system emerged into the Indian Ocean near Fort Dauphin as a tropical disturbance.[23] With generally favorable conditions, convection reorganized slightly and the system redeveloped outflow to the south.[24] Early on February\u00a024, Haruna re-intensified into a moderate tropical storm,[25] although soon after it weakened again due to cooler waters, increasing shear, and dry air.[26] At 1200\u00a0UTC, MFR issued its last advisory after Haruna began losing tropical characteristics, designating it as a subtropical depression.[27] The next day, the JTWC also discontinued advisories on the storm, noting that Haruna was dissipating about 665\u00a0km (415\u00a0mi) south-southwest of R\u00e9union.[28]"

Residents were evacuated using boats and canoes to shelters.[30] For several days while offshore western Madagascar, Haruna dropped greater than normal rainfall.[31] The storm ultimately made landfall about 15\u00a0hours faster than anticipated.[32] Winds and rainfall from Haruna damaged houses and power systems,[33] and also damaged 265\u00a0classrooms and 16\u00a0health facilities.[34] There was also damage to the rice and maize crops from high winds near the coast,[35] causing food shortages.[36] Rains from the storm caused a dyke along the Fiherenana River to break, which flooded a large region and forced about 6,000\u00a0people to evacuate their homes.[37] The flooding from the dyke break was worst in Toliara, where most residents lost access to fresh water and power. Flooding in the city caused the temporarily closure of the airport there.[33] The town of Morombe was temporarily isolated after the road was blocked. Power outages affected Morombe, Toliara, Sakaraha, and Betioky Sud.[38] Downed trees had affected roads near Toliara but were quickly removed.[30] About 1,050\u00a0houses were flooded, another 691 lost their roofs,[33] and 7,402 were destroyed, leaving 13,882\u00a0people homeless. Overall, Haruna killed 26\u00a0people and injured another 127.[39] There were initial difficulties in distributing aid to areas of southwestern Madagascar due to prevailing unsettled weather,[38] along with fuel shortages.[30] Workers used boats to rescue people in flooded areas.[38] Members of the Madagascar Armed Forces, along with about 200 Red Cross volunteers, assisted in evacuations and aid distribution,[40][30] and the Red Cross also provided free medical consultations to thousands of people.[30] Following the storm, there were increased levels of malaria, dysentery, and childhood diarrhea in the area around Toliara,[34] and there was a locust outbreak.[41] Increased locust activity persisted into the summer, and had been occurring since late 2012; this caused continued food shortages, and by July the locusts were affecting about half of the country's farmlands.[42] To prevent further spreading of disease, officials provided vaccinations and sprayed insecticide.[30] In isolated villages in southwestern Madagascar, residents faced food shortages, while in some areas, the water supply was contaminated.[43] Within a few weeks of the storms, many residents whose dwellings were not destroyed were able to return to their homes. In Toliara, about 4,000\u00a0students were initially unable to return to school due to being displaced.[44] In the middle of March, 1,948\u00a0displaced people stayed in a military camp or two schools,[34] but most returned home by early April.[45]  Repairs to the dyke in Toliara began in early April, and were expected to take about a month and a half.[45] On February\u00a023, the prime minister of Madagascar issued an appeal to the international community for assistance.[30] In Toliara, United Nations agencies, including the World Food Programme, and non-governmental organizations worked together to provide food for 3,000\u00a0people in six shelters.[30][38] The World Food Programme sent a truck with 1,050\u00a0tons of food to Toliara, including corn and legumes.[30] A few days after Haruna struck, the French Red Cross sent a ship to Toliara with 35\u00a0tons of supplies, including for housing and water. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies authorized funds to help up to 10,000\u00a0affected residents.[40] Handicap International provided food and shelter to 547\u00a0people in Toliara.[46] Action Against Hunger sent a plane with 15\u00a0tons of supplies, including water treatment units, to Madagascar after the storm.[47] By March\u00a020, 1,330\u00a0wells were disinfected by various crews.[30] On March\u00a01, the European Commission donated \u20ac200,000 for immediate relief.[48] The Red Crescent Society of the United Arab Emirates sent about 80\u00a0tonnes of food, medicine, and building supplies to the country.[49]"

A national all-time record high temperature of 46.0\u00a0\u00b0C (114.8\u00a0\u00b0F) occurred on 28 June in V\u00e9rargues.[6] In late July, a second heat wave occurred, during which all-time records were broken by 3\u00a0\u00b0C (5.4\u00a0\u00b0F) in Belgium, by 2.1\u00a0\u00b0C (3.8\u00a0\u00b0F) in Germany and the Netherlands, by 0.3\u00a0\u00b0C (0.5\u00a0\u00b0F) in Luxembourg, and by 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C (0.4\u00a0\u00b0F) in the United Kingdom. The deaths of 868 people in France and one person in Belgium were reported, along with thousands of animals when ventilation systems in barns were overwhelmed. Due to high river water temperatures and sluggish flows, particularly in France and to some extent Germany, a number of thermal power stations that use once-through cooling and do not have cooling towers had to reduce output or shut down to avoid breaching environmental limits on river water temperature designed to protect aquatic life.[7]"

Four departments of France were put on Red Alert: Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Gard, H\u00e9rault and Vaucluse.[32] Owing to building codes with old structures common across the country, numerous buildings in France lack air conditioning.[33] The French Government acted more proactively for the heat wave in light of its failings during the 2003 European heat wave. 15,000\u00a0people died during that event in France.[34] Approximately 4,000\u00a0schools closed nationwide.[35] Authorities in Paris opened public cooling rooms. Parks and pools extended operation hours in multiple cities.[34] Museums with air conditioning allowed free entry for all people.[33] France observed temperatures in excess of 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F) for the first time in recorded history. A national all-time record of 46.0\u00a0\u00b0C (114.8\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded by a staffed weather station in V\u00e9rargues on 28 June, verified by M\u00e9t\u00e9o France on 19 July.[6] Earlier, the highest temperature considered to have been reliably recorded during the heat wave was 45.9\u00a0\u00b0C (114.6\u00a0\u00b0F) by an automatic weather station in Gallargues-le-Montueux, also on 28 June.[36] These exceeded the previous record of 44.1\u00a0\u00b0C (111.4\u00a0\u00b0F), recorded in Conqueyrac and Saint-Christol-l\u00e8s-Al\u00e8s.[32] Twelve other locations observed temperatures above the previous record high.[37] Villevieille experienced temperatures of 45.1\u00a0\u00b0C (113.2\u00a0\u00b0F) on this day.[36] Numerous records were broken along the Mediterranean coastline. Montpellier observed a temperature of 43.5\u00a0\u00b0C (110.3\u00a0\u00b0F), shattering the previous all-time by 5.8\u00a0\u00b0C (10.4\u00a0\u00b0F).[34] Nantes and Bourges saw their highest low-temperature ever during the overnight of 27\u201328 June at 24.7\u00a0\u00b0C (76.5\u00a0\u00b0F) and 23.8\u00a0\u00b0C (74.8\u00a0\u00b0F), respectively.[37] Five people died nationwide: four from drowning and one from heat stroke.[35][38] Police noted an increase in instances of illegal fire hydrant openings. A six-year-old child was hospitalised in critical condition after being hit by a stream of water from an illegally opened hydrant.[35] Hospitals reported a significant increase in cases of cramps, dehydration, dizziness, and heart conditions.[33] In July 2019, France experienced its second heat wave in less than a month, beating several regional and national temperature records. In the previous month, a national record temperature of 46.1\u00a0\u00b0C (115.0\u00a0\u00b0F) was measured in the southern commune of Gallargues-le-Montueux.[39] More than 50 French cities exceeded their previous high temperature records in this heat wave.[40] On 23 July 80 departments of France were included in an orange heat wave alert by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, and 20 departments were included in a red alert the next day.[41][42] On 24 July, a temperature of 41.2\u00a0\u00b0C (106.2\u00a0\u00b0F) was registered by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in Bordeaux, breaking the city's previous record of 40.7\u00a0\u00b0C (105.3\u00a0\u00b0F) in 2003.[43] Similarly, on 25 July, a temperature of 42.6\u00a0\u00b0C (108.7\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded in Paris, also breaking the city's previous record of 40.4\u00a0\u00b0C (104.7\u00a0\u00b0F) in July 1947.[44][45] On the night of 24\u201325 July, France saw its hottest night since records began, as the whole country averaged an overnight low of 21.4\u00a0\u00b0C (70.5\u00a0\u00b0F), exceeding the record from the 2003 heat wave. Bordeaux saw an overnight low of 26.8\u00a0\u00b0C (80.2\u00a0\u00b0F), beating the previous record of 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F, 2006); Lille saw 23.2\u00a0\u00b0C (73.8\u00a0\u00b0F), exceeding the July 2007 record of 22.5\u00a0\u00b0C (72.5\u00a0\u00b0F).[46] Lille also saw a high of 41.5\u00a0\u00b0C (106.7\u00a0\u00b0F) the following day, above the record of 37.6\u00a0\u00b0C (99.7\u00a0\u00b0F) that had been set the previous year.[40] On 25 July, the chief architect of the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral told media that he feared that the heat wave could cause the cathedral's vaulted ceilings, damaged in an April 2019 fire, to collapse. While he indicated the stone walls were still stable for the time being, he explained that the walls were still saturated with water sprayed by firefighters during the blaze, and rapid drying from the extreme temperatures could adversely affect the stability of the structure.[47] Two nuclear reactors in southwest France were shut down and the output of six reactors were curtailed to avoid breaching environmental limits on the temperature of the rivers they use for cooling water.[48] This reduced French nuclear power generation by around 5.2 gigawatts at a time of increased electricity demand due to the use of cooling devices.[7] According to the French Ministry of Health, 567 were reported to have died during the June heat wave, and 868 people died as a result of the July heat wave.[49]"

Passengers were advised not to start new journeys as the overheating of overhead cables rendered many services unable to run.[127][128] On 26 July, all but essential travel had been advised against, after the extreme heat and storms caused severe disruption to the rail network and airports. Thameslink ran reduced services, with half of its lines unavailable. East Midlands Trains services between Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby and London St Pancras were disrupted due to overhead wire damage from the heat of the previous day, and an emergency timetable was put in place.[129] All Eurostar services to and from Paris were suspended for an \"undetermined amount of time\" due to an exploded cable, as well as delays lasting up to an hour on Brussels services.[130] Several flights were cancelled and delayed from Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports due to \"extreme weather conditions across Europe\".

The eighth tropical cyclone and fourth tropical storm of the season, this system was identified as a tropical storm east of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a020. After crossing the Lesser Antilles, the system entered the Caribbean Sea and achieved hurricane intensity on September\u00a021. After becoming a Category 2 hurricane, the storm struck the northern coast of Jamaica on September\u00a023. Early on September\u00a025, the cyclone reached Category\u00a04 status and attained maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) soon thereafter. Later that day, the hurricane made landfall in eastern Pinar del R\u00edo Province, Cuba. The system entered the Gulf of Mexico shortly thereafter and weakened slightly. Recurving to the northeast, the hurricane briefly threatened Louisiana before turning toward Florida. Early on September\u00a029, the hurricane made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida, with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Once over land, the cyclone rapidly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating on September\u00a030. Some islands in the Lesser Antilles experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall, including Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Lucia. In Jamaica, the hurricane caused significant damage to banana and coconut plantations. Communications from Holland Bay were disrupted when the station was demolished. The greatest damages were reported from the northern half of the island. Nine deaths occurred in the city of Port Antonio. In Nueva Gerona, Cuba, strong winds destroyed well-constructed buildings and all but 10\u00a0homes. The Isla de la Juventud overall experienced about $2\u00a0million (1917\u00a0USD) in damage and there were at least 20\u00a0fatalities. Orchards and crops were destroyed on the Pinar del R\u00edo Province. In Louisiana and Mississippi, impact was generally limited to damaged crops and timber stands. Ten deaths from drowning were reported in Louisiana. Farther east in Mobile, Alabama, portions of roofs, trees, and other debris littered streets. Communications were severed in Pensacola, Florida. Several small watercraft washed ashore, and numerous wharves, docks, and boat storages suffered impact. Total damages were estimated near $170,000 in Pensacola area. Five deaths were reported in Florida, all of them in Crestview. The storm and its remnants also produced rainfall in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina."

Steadily intensifying, the storm moved west-northwestward and crossed the Lesser Antilles between the islands of Saint Lucia and Martinique several hours later. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea on September\u00a021, the system intensified quicker, becoming a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale later that day. While passing south of the Tiburon Peninsula on the following day, the storm strengthened into a Category\u00a02 hurricane. Later on September\u00a023, the hurricane struck the northern coast of Jamaica, before re-emerging into the Caribbean Sea. Around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, it intensified into a Category\u00a03 hurricane while moving northwestward. Around that time, it struck Cayman Brac. Early on September\u00a025, the storm achieved Category\u00a04 status.[3] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a025, the hurricane attained its minimum barometric pressure of 928\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg), an estimate made by Ram\u00f3n Perez of the Instituto de Meteorolog\u00eda de la Rep\u00fablica de Cuba. Using a pressure-wind relationship, researchers at the National Hurricane Center estimated peak maximum sustained winds at 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[2] Shortly after peak intensity, the cyclone brushed Isla de la Juventud. By 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a025, the hurricane made landfall at the same intensity in the eastern part of Pinar del R\u00edo Province in Cuba. The system entered the Gulf of Mexico later on September\u00a025. The storm fell to Category 3 intensity early on September\u00a027. It briefly tracked generally northward and approached southeastern Louisiana before re-curving northeastward late the next day. At 02:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029, the hurricane made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida, with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Once over land, the system rapidly weakened to a tropical storm within 12\u00a0hours. Early on September\u00a030, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Georgia after merging with a frontal system. About six hours later, the remnants of the hurricane dissipated.[3] The minimum atmospheric pressure of 928\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg) established the cyclone as the third most intense landfalling Cuban hurricane. Deeper pressures of 921 and 915\u00a0mbar (27.2 and 27.0\u00a0inHg) were measured in the 1924 and 1932 hurricanes, respectively.[4] The cyclone (949\u00a0mbar, 28.0\u00a0inHg) was also the most intense tropical cyclone in the Florida Panhandle until Hurricane Opal (942\u00a0mbar, 27.8\u00a0inHg). At the time, it was tied with an 1882 storm, which also had a central pressure of 949\u00a0mbar (28.0\u00a0inHg) at landfall in northwest Florida.[5]"

Warnings were also released from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to New Orleans, Louisiana, on September\u00a026. The warnings were briefly discontinued because of track uncertainties, but they were re-issued when the cyclone began to curve northeast. On September\u00a027 and September\u00a028, scheduled vessel trips were cancelled in New Orleans, Louisiana. Marine traffic resumed after the storm passed east of the city. The storm struck the Gulf Coast later than anticipated because of slow forward motion.[6] In Louisiana, rain bands produced 6.40\u00a0in (163\u00a0mm) of rain in Burrwood.[6] The Louisville and Nashville Railroad sent trains on alternate routes because of eroded tracks near Lake Catherine. The effects of the cyclone also damaged crops and timber stands in Louisiana and Mississippi.[15] The storm surge associated with the hurricane moved several structures from their foundations in Buras, Louisiana.[6] There, the storm was blamed for the death of an 8-year-old boy.[2] Nine additional fatalities occurred near Houma after the fishing bark Wanna was wrecked.[16] In Biloxi, warnings prevented considerable loss of shrimp boats.[15] Street cars and other traffic were practically suspended in Gulfport.[17] In Alabama, more than 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) of rain was measured in Montgomery,[15] prompting flood advisories for the lower Alabama River watershed.[6] At Camp Sheridan, a United States Army World War I training camp, the streets were inundated with at least a few inches of water.[16] In Mobile, trees and telephone and telegraph wires were downed,[15][17] cutting off communications. Roofs were detached and the galleries of houses were torn away. Police stopped the streets cars were operating and shut off the electricity.[17] No boats from the area were lost, and waterfront damage was negligible.[15] The hurricane severed communication from Pensacola, Florida, though reports eventually indicated that the wireless radio plant was not destroyed.[15] Several small watercraft washed ashore, including the USS Quincy, and numerous wharves, docks, and boat storages received damage.[6] Total damages reached about $170,000 in the vicinity of Pensacola.[6] Near the city, a portion of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad was 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) underwater, while several of their bridges washed away.[16] At Valparaiso, tides reached 7.5\u00a0ft (2.3\u00a0m) above normal.[18] Significant destruction of timber occurred in Okaloosa and Santa Rosa counties, and crops, structures, and livestock were affected.[6] Strong winds occurred along the southwest coast of Florida, and a wind gust of 44\u00a0mph (71\u00a0km/h) was reported in Jacksonville.[6] A total of five people were killed in Crestview.[6] The storm and its remnants also produced rainfall in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.[19]"

On October 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward it developed an area of persistent convection on October 5.[1] Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were expected to become more favorable.[2] On October 7 it developed a broad low pressure area,[3] and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later developed into Tropical Storm Olivia. The eastern system developed organized convection near its center, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000\u00a0UTC on October 9, about 765\u00a0mi (1,231\u00a0km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.[1] Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving north-northwestward, around the western periphery of a weak ridge; the first forecast advisory by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the depression to gradually intensify before weakening and crossing the Baja California Peninsula.[4] Located over warm water temperatures, the system developed an area of organized, deep convection near the center; with satellite intensity estimates of tropical storm force using the Dvorak technique, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman about 12\u00a0hours after it first formed.[5] Strengthening continued, and Norman attained peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) early on October 10.[1] At the time, it was officially forecast to strengthen further and continue northeastward. However, some hurricane prediction models anticipated quick weakening and a sharp turn to the southeast.[6] Shortly after peaking in intensity, southwesterly wind shear increased, which led to a decrease in convection coverage. At the same time, a trough extending from California southward caused Norman to stall and turn to the east.[7] The convection rapidly became separated from the center; by late on October 10, the center was located about 115 miles (185\u00a0km) from the nearest thunderstorms. By then, it had weakened to tropical depression status,[8] and early on October 11 Norman degenerated into a remnant low about 530 miles (850\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.[1] The remnants of Norman continued to the east, and later to the east-southeast as it interacted with a tropical disturbance off the coast of Mexico.[1] Initially, re-development of Norman was not expected, as the disturbance was instead given the possibility for further development.[9] On October 13, the NHC noted that the remnants of Norman were merging with the disturbance to its east;[10] during the interaction, convection redeveloped and organized around the remnant low of Norman, and early on October 15 it reformed into a tropical depression, near the coast of southwestern Mexico.[1] With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, Norman was predicted to re-attain tropical storm status before moving ashore.[11] However, the center quickly became less-organized,[12] turning northward and northwestward within the larger tropical disturbance. Late on October 15, it is estimated Tropical Depression Norman dissipated 23 miles (37\u00a0km) south and offshore of Manzanillo, Colima, although satellite imagery suggested the center may have dissipated inland.[1]"

The storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status. After passing through the Leeward Islands on January 2, 1955, Alice reached peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast. It dissipated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea. Alice produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path. Saba and Anguilla were affected the most, with total damage amounting to $623,500\u00a0in 1955\u00a0USD (greater than $6,500,000\u00a0in 2022\u00a0USD).

The anticyclone moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 30 while located 770 miles (1,240\u00a0km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles, though operationally, the system was believed to have become a tropical depression on December 31.[1] With a narrow ridge of high pressure to its north, the depression moved west-southwestward. Atmospheric conditions were unusually favorable for the time of the year due to the ridge of high pressure preventing cold air from reaching the central Atlantic Ocean. This allowed the depression to intensify into a tropical storm later on December 30, based on direct observations. There were few direct observations for the following days, but it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on December 31 while located about 475 miles (764\u00a0km) east-northeast of Barbuda. On January 1, 1955, a ship within 10 miles (16\u00a0km) of the center reported hurricane-force winds and a pressure of 987\u00a0mbar (29.15\u00a0inHg). Based on this report and several other ship reports, the system was recognized as a tropical low by the San Juan Weather Bureau Office. The hurricane continued to the southwest, and entered the Caribbean Sea on January 2 after passing between Saint Martin and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy. A portion of the eyewall moved over Saint Martin and Saba. Based on near-hurricane-force winds from the affected islands, an information bulletin named the system as Hurricane Alice while in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. Throughout its track, Alice was a small tropical cyclone with a diameter of only around 60 miles (97\u00a0km).[1] Reconnaissance aircraft flew into Hurricane Alice on January 3 and confirmed the existence of the tropical cyclone by reporting winds between 60 and 65\u00a0mph (97 and 105\u00a0km/h) and a warm core center. It is estimated Alice continued to intensify as it tracked southwestward in the Caribbean Sea, and attained peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) while located about 95 miles (153\u00a0km) west-northwest of Montserrat. While near its peak the hurricane developed a ring of convection around its eye, and Alice maintained peak winds for about 24\u00a0hours until cold air from the north weakened it. Extratropical cyclogenesis occurred north of Bermuda on January 3, which weakened the high pressure system to the north of Alice and turned the flow in the Caribbean Sea to that of cold northwesterly winds. Alice turned to the southeast on January 4 and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Convection gradually became disorganized, and after weakening to a tropical depression on January 5, Alice dissipated on January 6 while located about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) west-northwest of Grenada.[1]"

        "content": "Subsequent to the confirmation of the existence of Hurricane Alice, the U.S. Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico warned the islands of the northern Lesser Antilles to prepare for strong winds and rough seas.[1] Hurricane Alice produced moderate to strong winds across the islands, peaking at 81\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) in Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) in Saba.[2] The hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across several islands, including a peak of 11.27 inches (286\u00a0mm) in 48\u00a0hours recorded at Saba. Due to its small size, only a few islands received significant effects from the hurricane. Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, Saba, Anguilla, Sint Eustatius, and Saint Kitts reported damage from the hurricane, totaling $623,500 (1955\u00a0USD, $4.7\u00a0million 2006\u00a0USD). Damage was heaviest on Saba and Anguilla, occurring primarily to shipping facilities and crops.[1] 626\u00a0houses were destroyed or severely damaged on Anguilla, as well.[3] The damage was caused mostly by heavy rainfall and rough seas, not the direct action of the wind. The passage of Hurricane Alice greatly troubled the economies of the small affected islands.[1] Additionally, the outer rainbands of the storm alleviated dry conditions on Puerto Rico which had persisted since the previous October. No deaths were reported.[2] This storm formed on December 30; however, in the days before satellites, meteorologists had to rely on reports from ships and islands in the Atlantic to locate and track storms. This information was often sketchy; two cyclones, including a Category 2 hurricane, operationally went undetected in 1954. It was officially recognized as a significant tropical cyclone on January 2, 1955. At the time, the National Weather Service used the same naming list each year, so the name given to this storm was \"Alice\" and it was designated as a part of the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season. However, it was found during post-storm analysis that the storm had actually formed on December 30, and was instead a part of the 1954 season. Therefore, the season had two storms named \"Alice\" \u2014 the first storm of the season, and the last. Had Alice been discovered before the end of the calendar year, it would have been named Irene, the next name on the 1954 list. Some reports named this storm Alice2 to avoid confusion with the earlier Alice from June 1954.[1][4][5] Alice formed later in the calendar year than any Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, forming six hours later in the season than Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Alice was one of only eight Atlantic tropical cyclones to form in the month of December. Alice was the first of two Atlantic tropical cyclones to exist in two calendar years, the other being 2005's Zeta. The hurricane was also one of only six tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist in the month of January, with the most recent being an unnamed subtropical cyclone in 2023.[6]"

It had five Category\u00a04 hurricanes \u2013 the highest number recorded in a single season in the Atlantic basin, previously tied in 1933 and 1961, and later tied in 2005 and 2020. The season officially began on June\u00a01, and ended on November\u00a030. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first storm, Arlene, formed on June\u00a011 to the southeast of Bermuda. It meandered slowly for a week and caused no impact on land. Other tropical cyclones that did not affect land were Hurricane Cindy, Tropical Storm Emily, and Tropical Depression Twelve. Localized or otherwise minor damage occurred from Hurricanes Bret, Gert, and Jose, and tropical storms Harvey and Katrina. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Floyd, a strong Category\u00a04 hurricane that caused devastating flooding along the East Coast of the United States, especially in North Carolina. Damage from the storm totaled approximately $6.5\u00a0billion (1999\u00a0USD)[nb 1] and there were at least 77\u00a0fatalities, making it the deadliest hurricane in the United States since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Flooding from Floyd in North Carolina followed Hurricane Dennis, a slow and erratic\u2013moving storm that dropped heavy rainfall in the eastern portion of the state. Tropical Depression Eleven in October contributed to extreme flooding in Mexico, which left 636\u00a0people dead and caused $491.3\u00a0million in damage, though impact could not be distinguished from the storm itself. Hurricane Irene caused extensive flooding in Cuba and Florida, with lesser effects in the Bahamas and North Carolina. Irene was the second\u2013costliest storm of the season, with about $800\u00a0million in damage. Hurricane Lenny was an unusual eastward\u2013moving storm in the Caribbean Sea and a strong late\u2013season storm. It caused extensive damage in the Lesser Antilles in the month of November. Collectively, the storms of the 1999\u00a0Atlantic hurricane season caused at least 123\u00a0fatalities and $8.328\u00a0billion in losses."

        "content": "Ahead of and during each hurricane season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI. The forecasts include weekly or monthly assessments of the significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.[1] Gray and his team at CSU issued their initial season outlook on December\u00a04, 1998, predicting fourteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. The three main factors for this above average season forecast cited included a continuation of abnormally warm sea surface temperatures, the probability that La Ni\u00f1a conditions would remain, and that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) winds would be in a westerly phase.[6] Early in 1999, WRC issued its forecast for the season, projecting ten named storms and six hurricanes, but no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.[4] In subsequent outlooks from Gray and his associates in April, June, and August, the predictions were unchanged.[3] On April\u00a07, CSU noted that the probability of a major hurricane landfall in the United States was 72%, including a 54% chance on the East Coast and a 40% likelihood on the Gulf Coast.[7] In their outlook on May\u00a027, experts at NOAA noted that an above average season was a strong possibility. An addition to a La Ni\u00f1a, vertical wind shear would be decreased across much of the Caribbean Sea and tropical Atlantic Ocean, and a favorable jet pattern for tropical waves to develop into tropical cyclones.[8] On June\u00a01, TSR predicted that there would be 12\u00a0named storms, 7\u00a0hurricanes, and 2\u00a0major hurricanes.[5] As stated by NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981\u20132010 contains roughly 12\u00a0tropical storms, 6\u00a0hurricanes, 3\u00a0major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) Index of 66\u2013103 units.[1] NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, of below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.[9]"

Five hurricanes intensified further into major hurricanes.[11] The season featured a record-tying five Category\u00a04 hurricanes,[15] later tied again in 2005 and 2020.[16] These were Bret, Cindy, Floyd, Gert, and Hurricane Lenny.[11] The last storm of the season, Hurricane Lenny, dissipated on November\u00a023,[17] which was about a week before the official season ending on November\u00a030, 1999.[8] A persistent La Ni\u00f1a that developed during the previous season was attributed to the above average activity.[18] Between August and October, there was very low wind shear over the Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic Ocean, attributed to a combination of abnormal upper-level easterly winds and low-level westerly winds.[19] Six hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused at least 123\u00a0deaths and approximately $8.19\u00a0billion in damage. Hurricane Gert also caused damage and fatalities, despite not making landfall.[20] Overall, the season's activity was reflected with a high cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 177.[21] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39\u00a0mph; 63\u00a0km/h) or tropical storm strength.[22]"

Initially, the system resembled a subtropical cyclone, due to its frontal characteristics. The nascent depression drifted northward for 24\u00a0hours, and during this time, it strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene at 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a012, based on Dvorak satellite classifications. The storm intensified further to its peak intensity at 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a013, with estimated maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,006\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg), based on ship reports and satellite. Subsequently, weakening due to westerly wind shear, Arlene tracking westward on June\u00a013 and turned northwest the following day. Because the steering current became poorly defined, it drifted starting on June\u00a015, and executed a small cyclonic loop later that day. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a017, Arlene was downgraded to a tropical depression. Later that day, it passed about 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) east of Bermuda,[10] where gale-force winds and abnormally high tides were observed.[23] The depression weakened further due to decreasing sea surface temperatures and dissipated early on June\u00a018.[10]"

After striking the Abaco Islands in the Bahama, conditions improved, allowing for Dennis to strengthen into a Category\u00a02 by August\u00a028. Around this time, Dennis began to move parallel to the Southeastern United States. Early on August\u00a030, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 962\u00a0mbar (28.4\u00a0inHg). By the following day, steering currents collapsed and the storm interacted with a cold front, causing Dennis to move erratically offshore North Carolina. Wind shear and cold air associated with the front weakened Dennis to a tropical storm on September\u00a01 and removed some of its tropical characteristics. Eventually, warmer ocean temperatures caused some re-strengthening. By September\u00a04, Dennis turned northwestward and made landfall in Cape Lookout, North Carolina, as a strong tropical storm. The storm slowly weakened inland, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over western New York on September\u00a07.[49] In the Bahamas, Dennis produced moderate winds, rain, and storm surge on San Salvador, Crooked Island, Eleuthera, and Abaco Islands, resulting in damage to roofs and coastal properties.[50] Dennis brought 6\u20138\u00a0ft (1.8\u20132.4\u00a0m) waves to the east coast of Florida, causing minor erosion and four drowning deaths. The waves left severe erosion and coastal flooding along the Outer Banks of North Carolina.[49] An 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) deep channel created along Highway 12 isolated three towns on Hatteras Island.[51] In Carteret, Craven, and Dare counties, the storm damaged at least 2,025\u00a0homes and businesses to some degree.[52] Heavy rainfall, peaking at 19.91\u00a0in (506\u00a0mm) at Ocracoke, fell in eastern North Carolina.[24] Although the precipitation was generally beneficial due to drought conditions, it also damaged crops.[49] Two indirect deaths occurred in Richlands during a weather-related car accident.[53] Similar inland flooding occurred in northern and eastern Virginia,[49] with precipitation reaching 10.21\u00a0in (259\u00a0mm) near Lawrenceville.[54] A tornado in Hampton severely damaged five apartment complexes, three of which were condemned completely, as well an assisted living facility; about 460\u00a0people were forced to evacuate from the buildings, and as many as 800\u00a0vehicles may have been damaged.[55] Overall damage in North Carolina and Virginia totaled about $157\u00a0million.[49] Generally minor flooding occurred in the Mid-Atlantic and New England.[55]"

By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, the depression attained maximum sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,006\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg).[13] Shortly thereafter, the center of circulation of the depression became difficult to locate, but was likely heading north-northwestward. Due to warm ocean temperatures, the SHIPS model predicted further intensification, despite the storm having almost no deep convection and being close to land.[58] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, the depression made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, with winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h). The depression quickly weakened inland, and dissipated about twenty-four hours after landfall. Due to forecasts that the depression would strengthen to a tropical storm, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for Tampico to Matamoros, Tamaulipas.[13] The storm caused heavy rainfall in Mexico, with as much as 17.43\u00a0in (443\u00a0mm) falling in Ciudad Mante in the state of Tamaulipas. In Texas, the depression produced light rainfall, peaking at 3.35\u00a0in (85\u00a0mm) in Harlingen.[59]"

The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Floyd on the following day. Floyd became a hurricane on September\u00a010, while curving northwestward, before the storm resumed its initial west-northwestward course late on the following day. Significant intensification occurred on September\u00a012 and September\u00a013. At 12:00\u00a0UTC on the latter date, Floyd peaked with maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 921\u00a0mbar (27.2\u00a0inHg). Thereafter, the storm began weakening while approaching the Bahamas, decreasing to Category\u00a03 intensity at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014. Six hours later, Floyd made landfall near Alice Town on Eleuthera with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h), around the time that the cyclone began moving north-northwestward. Shortly before striking the Abaco Islands at 19:00\u00a0UTC, the hurricane re-intensified into a Category\u00a04 hurricane. Early on September\u00a015, Floyd weakened to a Category\u00a03 hurricane and passed 110\u00a0mi (180\u00a0km) offshore Florida. Floyd weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane late on September\u00a015, while re-curving to the north-northeast. At 16:30\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, Floyd made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina, with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h). Thereafter, the storm rapidly weakened and was a tropical storm by early on the following day. Floyd moved along the coasts of the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey, before striking Long Island in New York early on September\u00a017. Shortly thereafter, Floyd transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while interacting with a frontal zone over Maine.[60] In the Bahamas, a combination of strong winds and storm surge destroyed numerous restaurants, hotels, shops, and homes,[61] and left tens of thousands without water, electricity, and food. One death was reported.[62] Although millions of people in Florida evacuated, damage was relatively minor.[60] The outer bands of Floyd produced up to 3.2\u00a0in (81\u00a0mm) of rain and tropical storm force winds.[63] As a result, hundreds of trees were downed, which damaged at 467\u00a0houses, and several hotels and businesses. Impact in Georgia and South Carolina was minor. North Carolina bore the brunt of the storm.[60] Heavy precipitation fell in the eastern portion of the state, peaking at 24.06\u00a0in (611\u00a0mm) near Southport.[24] Numerous rivers experienced at least 500-year floods, causing extensive flooding. About 7,000\u00a0homes were destroyed and an additional 56,000\u00a0suffered damage, of which 17,000\u00a0houses were left uninhabitable. At the height of the storm, more than 500,000\u00a0people lacked electricity. Thirty-five fatalities and about $4\u00a0billion in damage occurred in North Carolina.[64] Flooding in Virginia damaged about 182\u00a0businesses and 9,250\u00a0houses, and left about 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) of standing water in Franklin. There were three deaths and $101\u00a0million in losses.[65] In Maryland, flooding damaged at least 694\u00a0homes, impacted numerous bridges and roads, and left over 250,000\u00a0residents without power. Similar effects occurred in Delaware, with at least 171\u00a0houses damaged and numerous roads being inundated or washed out.[55] In Pennsylvania, flash flooding affected over 10,000\u00a0homes and left more than 500,000\u00a0people without electricity.[64] Losses reached $60\u00a0million and there were 13\u00a0deaths in the state. The storm also caused significant impact in New Jersey, where 3,978\u00a0homes, 1,358\u00a0apartments, and 1,758\u00a0businesses were destroyed or suffered major damage. Six deaths occurred in the state. New York, New England,[55] and Atlantic Canada also experienced flooding, but to a much lesser degree.[66] In New York City, Floyd dropped 5.02\u00a0in (128\u00a0mm) of rainfall at the Central Park observatory, setting a daily record for precipitation on September\u00a016.[67] Overall, Floyd caused about $6.5\u00a0billion in damage and 73\u00a0fatalities.[60][64]"

Due to the development of a low-level circulation and convective banding, the wave became a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011 to the south of the Cape Verde islands.[68] After increases in intensity, banding features, and outflow improvement,[69] the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert on September\u00a012 while moving west-northwestward to the south of a subtropical ridge.[68] Warm ocean temperatures and an anticyclone aloft allowed Gert to reach hurricane intensity by the following day.[68][70][71] Early on September\u00a015, Gert attained major hurricane strength. After reaching Category 4 status that day, Gert strengthened further, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg) on September\u00a016.[68] An eyewall replacement cyclone, as well as increasing wind shear and an upper-level trough restricting outflow later on,[72][73] Gert weakened to a low-end Category\u00a03 on September\u00a018.[68] Gert re-strengthened to a Category\u00a04 hurricane on September\u00a019.[68] However, dry air and colder sea surface temperatures began causing the storm to weaken,[74][75] with Gert falling to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on September\u00a020 and a Category\u00a02 hurricane on September\u00a021. That day, the hurricane passed about 135\u00a0mi (217\u00a0km) east of Bermuda.[68] Accelerating northeastward under the influence of an approaching trough,[76] Gert weakened to a tropical storm on September\u00a023 after convection decreased around the center.[68] By 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, convection diminished enough that the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated about 55\u00a0mi (89\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland.[68][77] About six hours later, the remnants of Gert were absorbed by a larger extratropical storm.[68] For several days, Gert threatened to strike Bermuda, prompting the evacuation of tourists.[78] Although Gert's center did not make landfall, it passed a short distance east of the island,[68] producing hurricane-force winds that left 11,000\u00a0people without power.[79] High waves swept two people out to sea at Acadia National Park in Maine.[68] Later, strong waves struck Newfoundland and left heavy marine damage, with about $1.9\u00a0million in damage done to a wharf along the Avalon Peninsula.[80]"

Harvey then accelerated across Florida and by early on September\u00a022, merged with a developing extratropical low while located near Grand Bahama.[81] The remnants reached Atlantic Canada before dissipating on September\u00a024.[82] In Florida, precipitation peaked at 10.24\u00a0in (260\u00a0mm) in Naples.[63] As a result, at least 34\u00a0houses and businesses were flooded. There were sporadic reports of tropical storm-force winds throughout the state,[55]  as well as two tornadoes, neither of which caused left severe impact. Damage estimates in Florida reached about $15\u00a0million.[81] Throughout the rest of the United States, impact was limited, confined to light rainfall in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.[83] Heavy precipitation was reported in Atlantic Canada, with 11.89\u00a0in (302\u00a0mm) of rain falling in Oxford, Nova Scotia, making Harvey the wettest tropical cyclone or remnants on record in that country.

The next day, it made landfall in Key West, Florida, and again near Cape Sable. Later on October\u00a015, Irene moved back over water near Jupiter as a minimal hurricane. It slowly strengthened as it paralleled the East Coast of the United States. When Irene interacted with a trough from the west, while over the warm Gulf Stream waters, the hurricane rapidly intensified and attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 958\u00a0mbar (28.3\u00a0inHg) on October\u00a018.

The eighth named storm[a] of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Harold developed from a tropical wave that entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 20, after passing through the Bahamas and South Florida. The system steadily organized over the following days, over record-warm sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf, as it progressed westward. Although the disturbance had not become organized enough to become a tropical cyclone yet, due to the threat it posed to southern Texas, the United States\u2013based National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine on August 21. The disturbance organized into a tropical depression six hours later, before strengthening into a tropical storm the following morning and receiving the name Harold. Harold continued to strengthen as it moved quickly westward, and the cyclone made landfall on Padre Island, Texas, around 15:00 UTC[b] on August 22, as a 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) tropical storm. Harold quickly weakened as it moved inland over southern Texas and dissipated on August 23, though its remnant mid-level circulation and associated moisture affected the central United States for several more days. Harold led to severe wind gusts and significant rainfall as it struck Texas. Corpus Christi reported 5.25\u00a0in (133\u00a0mm) of rain from Harold, including a daily record of 4.74\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) on August 22; similarly significant rainfall was reported in northern Mexico, peaking at 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) in Piedras Negras in the state of Coahuila.  A modest storm surge of up to 2.2\u00a0ft (0.67\u00a0m) was reported at San Luis Pass. Wind gusts of up to 67\u00a0mph (108\u00a0km/h) affected the area, and over 35,000 electricity customers lost power during the storm. One school district in Texas had to shut down for several days following the storm due to the damage Harold inflicted on its classrooms. The remnants of Harold affected the southwestern United States for several days, producing flash flooding that killed one person and left another missing in Nevada. Overall damage from Harold was minor in most areas, however, totaling to around $505,000 (2023 USD)."

Despite this, due to the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) expectation that the system would strengthen into a tropical storm and strike the Texas coast the next day, advisories were initiated on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine at 15:00 UTC on August 21.[9] About three hours after being designated a potential tropical cyclone, the system acquired a closed, well-defined circulation; it thus met the criteria of a tropical cyclone and became the ninth tropical depression of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season at 18:00 UTC that day.[1]:\u200a2 The newly formed cyclone continued to become better organized as it moved more quickly westward toward the Texas coast, steered by a mid-level ridge to its north. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Harold at 6:00 UTC on August 22, as the broad cyclone's rain bands began to move onshore.[10] Shortly before landfall, Harold's center reformed to the north of its previous position, and the storm strengthened further to achieve its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h)[11] and a minimum barometric pressure of 996 millibars.[12] Harold made landfall on Padre Island, Texas by 15:00 UTC at peak intensity.[13] Harold weakened quickly as it moved inland, dropping back to tropical depression status about six hours later, at which time the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) took over responsibility for issuing advisories on the storm from the NHC.[14] Late that day, Tropical Depression Harold crossed into northern Mexico and continued to steadily weaken.[15] The WPC issued its final advisory on Harold at 15:00 UTC on August 23 as its surface low became increasingly ill-defined and dissipated far inland over Mexico.[16] The depression finally degenerated to a remnant low over the Big Bend region of Texas that day, dissipating shortly thereafter.[1]:\u200a2"

        "content": "On August 21, upon Harold's precursor's designation as a potential tropical cyclone, a tropical storm warning was issued for much of the coast of southern Texas, from the mouth of the Rio Grande river, at the Texas-Mexico border, up to Port O'Connor, placing 1.3\u00a0million residents under the tropical storm warning, with rainfall anticipated to reach up to 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm).[17][18] A Tropical Storm Watch was issued from north of Port O\u2019Connor to Sargent. The Texas Division of Emergency Management, the state government's emergency management division, was deployed ahead of Harold's expected landfall, and the Texas State Emergency Operations Center was activated to Level II that day, indicating \"escalated response conditions\".[19] Several school districts in multiple communities across the southern Texas coast were closed in advance of the storm for several days.[20] Residents across southern Texas were advised to prepare for the potential for flash flooding and tornadoes.[21] Harold struck South Texas with strong winds and heavy rain as it moved across the region. A modest storm surge of 1.6\u20132.2 feet (0.67\u00a0m) was reported in areas including Port Lavaca, Galveston Bay, and San Luis Pass. Sustained winds of 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h), with stronger gusts of 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), were reported at Corpus Christi International Airport, as well as 3.06\u00a0in (78\u00a0mm) of rainfall. A peak wind gust of 67\u00a0mph (107\u00a0km/h) was measured at Loyola Beach, while rainfall peaked at 6.98\u00a0in (177\u00a0mm) in Orange Grove.[1]:\u200a4\u200a Harold's rains were somewhat beneficial in certain areas of Southern Texas, which was in the midst of a moderate to severe drought before Harold's landfall.[22] Harold dropped a total of 4.74\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) of rain in a 24-hour period in Corpus Christi, setting a new daily rainfall record for the city, surpassing the previous record set by the much more powerful Hurricane Bret in 1999. Further, Corpus Christi was originally on track for one of its driest summers on record before Harold's landfall, but following the storm the city's summer rainfall rose above the seasonal average.[23] Total rainfall from Harold reached 5.42\u00a0in (138\u00a0mm) in Corpus Christi and 5.15\u00a0in (131\u00a0mm) in Portland. Wind gusts of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) affected Corpus Christi as well.[24] Two EF0 tornadoes were recorded in the counties of Live Oak and Jim Wells, however they caused minimal damage.[1]:\u200a4 Over 35,000 homes and business lost power due to Harold.[25] The London Independent School District was shut down for several days due to damage sustained during the storm.[26] Floods in Robstown inundated roads; firefighters in Robstown monitored flood-prone streets.[27] Gusty winds caused minor damage across Corpus Christi, mostly limited to downed trees, fences, and light poles.[28] Heavy rain caved in ceiling tiles inside a building owned by the American Legion in Corpus Christi, which had already been damaged by Hurricane Harvey in 2017.[29] Storm surge raised water levels up to 2.6 ft (0.8 m) in Corpus Christi Bay. Storm surge flooding inundated the parking lot of the Art Museum of South Texas, as well as closing multiple roads and turnaround of U.S. Route 181 in the North Beach neighborhood.[30] Storm surge also scattered debris and caused beach erosion on Padre Island.[31] In Kleberg County, tropical storm-force winds downed trees and brought beneficial rainfall to parts of the area.[32] Street flooding also occurred in Kingsville.[33] First responders performed a water rescue near Alfred, after a vehicle attempted to traverse a flooded low-level crossing.[34] Several roads were closed due to flooding in Laredo, including an intersection of Interstate 35.[35] Across Laredo, 15 high water rescues were performed.[36] Overall, damage across Texas totaled $381,000.[2]"

The highest rainfall total in the state was 2.49\u00a0in (63\u00a0mm) in Nathrop.[37] The storm brought the first Atlantic tropical rain in the state in 15 years.[38] The heavy rainfall in Colorado resulted in flash floods and mudflows. The collection of water on the burn scar of the Grizzly Creek Fire resulted in a mudslide that closed a portion of Interstate 70 near Glenwood Springs.[39] Minor flooding occurred in Cortez, which entered a few basements.[40] Flooding also submerged roads and entered basements in De Beque, Marble, and Rifle. Damage across Colorado reached $24,000.[4][41][42] Heavy rainfall occurred in New Mexico, reaching a peak amount of 3.3 in (84.6 mm) in La Luz. Multiple locations across the Sacramento Mountains recorded rainfall totals in excess of 2 in (51 mm), as well.[43] A rockslide blocked part of U.S. Route 82 near Mountain Park.[44] Moisture from Harold, combined with the remnants of Eastern Pacific Hurricane Hilary, also led to rainfall across parts of Arizona and Nevada.[45] The Paria River rose up to 6.6 ft (2 m) above normal late on August 24 in Marble Canyon.[46] The scar from the Schultz Fire and Pipeline Fire resulted in a debris flow that blocked a road near Sunset Crater.[47] Thunderstorms over the Las Vegas Valley resulted in numerous severe thunderstorm and flash flood warnings being issued.[48] Only around half an inch (13 mm) of precipitation was observed in most of Las Vegas, although a pump station along Desert Inn Road near the Las Vegas Strip recorded a maximum precipitation amount of 1.34 in (34 mm) within an hour.[49][50] Despite the overall low amount of rainfall the desert environment of the region led to these rainfall totals having a more significant effect.[49] Flash flooding inundated parts of the Las Vegas Strip. One person drowned in a wash amidst the intense flooding, while another was reported missing.[3] The Harrah's Las Vegas casino suffered damage to ceiling tiles and water leaks.[48] Losses in Nevada reached $100,000.[3] Heavy rainfall was observed in Utah, with rainfall rates in excess of 0.4 in (10 mm) at Mary Jane Canyon in Grand County. The resultant downstream flooding swept away a woman and her dog, however, both were rescued without injuries.[51] Further east in Nebraska, the remnants of Harold produced heavy rainfall in Cheyenne County, which flooded roads in Sidney, stranding a vehicle in high water.[52]"

The tornado, peaking with winds up to 120 miles per hour (190\u00a0km/h) touched down around 2:45\u00a0pm\u00a0EDT and traveled for 15\u00a0minutes. The worst damage was along a 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) stretch of the track[7] in Wantage where a state of emergency was declared;[8] in this area, hundreds of trees were tossed in multiple directions, a corn field was decimated by the tornado's winds and damaged a dairy farm.[7] One 70 feet (21\u00a0m) tall silo, made of 40 tons of concrete and steel, was destroyed by the tornado. Two of the barns on the dairy farm were destroyed and two others were severely damaged. A large portion of one of the barns roof was torn off, and was tossed roughly .75 miles (1.21\u00a0km) before landing in the yard of another home. Another barn was pick up and twisted around despite being secured by 18 poles anchored 4 feet in the ground.[9] There were also 100 cows on the farm at the time of the tornado, of which one was reported missing. Residents who saw the tornado reported that two of the cows were picked up and tossed 50 feet (15\u00a0m) by the tornado. On the dairy farm property alone, roughly 600 trees were uprooted.[9] Severe storms in the region also produced damaging wind gusts up to 70 miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h). Torrential rainfall also fell within these storms, triggering widespread flash flooding. Numerous power lines were downed and a 100 feet (30\u00a0m) radio tower collapsed due to the winds.[8] The tornado was one of 145 to touch down in the state since 1950 and the first to hit Wantage in 29 years.[10] Throughout the state, roughly 25,000 residences were left without power due to the storms.[11]"

        "content": " Hurricane Paula was a small hurricane that struck Honduras and Cuba in October\u00a02010. The eighteenth tropical cyclone, sixteenth named storm, and ninth hurricane of the season, Paula developed from a low pressure area over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October\u00a011. Moving northwestward, it slowly organized and was upgraded to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Around midday on October\u00a011, Paula made landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios at the border of Honduras and Nicaragua. In northeastern Honduras, strong winds destroyed several homes, while rainfall destroyed a few roads and dozens of buildings, include a school and a police station. Favorable conditions such as low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures allowed Paula to reach hurricane status early on October\u00a012. Further intensification occurred, and the storm peaked with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) while curving northward on October\u00a013. Due to Paula's small size, impact in Mexico was minor, mainly limited to light rainfall and winds. However, an American tourist drowned offshore Cozumel. After Paula attained its peak intensity on October\u00a013, wind shear began to increase, causing the storm to weaken. The storm turned north-northeastward and fell to tropical storm intensity on October\u00a014. Shortly thereafter, Paula made landfall in the Cuban province of Pinar del R\u00edo. Early on October\u00a015, Paula weakened to a tropical depression while moving eastward over Cuba, before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area about six hours later. In Cuba, rainfall was mostly beneficial. Strong winds, with gusts reaching 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h), left power outages in Pinar del R\u00edo and Artemisa provinces. In the Havana area, a few homes were deroofed, while falling trees blocked many roads. Impact in the Florida Keys was minimal, limited to light rainfall and increased tides."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Nicole exited the Caribbean Sea and became extratropical on September 29, before dissipating on the next day, leaving behind a broad area of cyclonic circulation at the lower levels of the atmosphere. A southeasterly-moving cold front drifted from the Gulf of Mexico into the Caribbean Sea on October 5, and developed into a stationary north\u2013south trough axis the following day. When a tropical wave that was associated with the previous development of Hurricane Otto traced into the Caribbean on October 7, there was an escalation in the convection associated with the system. Another tropical wave traveled from the Lesser Antilles to the western Caribbean between October 9 and 10. A large low-pressure area formed as the wave interacted with the trough; however, convection decreased on October 10.[1] After convection increased again, the eighteenth tropical depression of the season developed at 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a011, while situated about 120 miles (190\u00a0km) southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios, which is on the Honduras-Nicaragua border. About six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Paula. Steered northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge, the storm made landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) at 1200\u00a0UTC. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to significantly intensify, due to sea surface temperatures of 84.2\u00a0\u00b0F (29.0\u00a0\u00b0C),[1] as well as light to moderate wind shear.[2] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories until late on October\u00a011, after satellite imagery, surface observations, and reconnaissance aircraft flight data confirmed the existence of a tropical cyclone; by this time, Paula was already a strong tropical storm.[3] At 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a012, Paula strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[1] Satellite imagery during the afternoon of October\u00a012 indicated that Paula was a small hurricane, consisting of a round area of deep convection, with an eye feature developing.[4] However, at 1800\u00a0UTC on October\u00a012, the storm strengthened into a Category\u00a02 hurricane while curving northward. Simultaneously, Paula attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 981\u00a0mbar (29.0\u00a0inHg). After reaching peak intensity late on October\u00a012, strong upper-level west-southwesterly winds interacted with the system, prompting weakening. Paula was a very small hurricane; hurricane-force winds extended only 25 miles (40\u00a0km) from the center of Paula, while tropical storm-force winds extended 70 miles (110\u00a0km) from the same point. Paula moved north-northwest as the storm was impacted by a mid-latitude trough over the Gulf of Mexico.[1] Increasing wind shear caused Paula to weaken to a Category\u00a01 hurricane late on October\u00a013.[1] Satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft flights indicated that cloud pattern was disrupted and the mid- and low-level centers were becoming detached.  Shortly thereafter, Lixion Avila of the National Hurricane Center remarked about the size of Paula, stating that, \"a hurricane is crossing between the western tip of Cuba and eastern Yucatan...but without modern technology no one would know it was there\".[5] Drifting north-northeastward ahead of a mid-latitude trough, Paula weakened to a tropical storm at 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a014. Three hours later, the storm made landfall between Santa Luc\u00eda and Puerto Esperanza, in the Pinar del R\u00edo Province of Cuba, with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). By 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, Paula weakened to a tropical depression, while moving eastward over Cuba. Six hours later, the storm degenerated into a remnant low  before completely dissipating early on October\u00a016.[1]"

Additionally, a yellow alert was issued for five departments, including Atl\u00e1ntida, Col\u00f3n, Cort\u00e9s, Olancho, and Yoro.[6] A state of emergency was also declared for the Bay Islands Department on October\u00a012 and was to remain in place for 48\u00a0hours.[7] Along the northeastern coast of Honduras, several homes were destroyed by the storm. Dangerous conditions produced by Paula also forced officials to evacuate low-lying areas and shut down schools.[8] Gale-force winds onshore resulted in the closure of the Puerto Lempira Airport.[9] Throughout coastal districts, rainfall from the storm ranged from 5.9 to 7.9\u00a0in (150 to 200\u00a0mm), resulting in widespread flooding. Winds from the storm were also estimated up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), and locals in La Mosquitia stated that the winds were stronger than those produced by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.[10] In Puerto Lempira, four homes and two roads were destroyed by high winds and flooding.[7] In the city, a total of 3.31\u00a0in (84\u00a0mm) of rain fell during Paula's passage on October\u00a011.[11] More than a dozen structures in Cauquira, including a school and police station were also damaged by flood waters.

In Cape San Antonio, 4.85\u00a0in (123\u00a0mm) of rain fell by the morning of October\u00a014.[20][21] In some areas of western Cuba, the heavy precipitation was beneficial to reservoirs, grain crops, tubers and vegetables.[22] The highest winds recorded during the storm's passage were measured in Puerto Esperanza at 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h).[23] Strong winds left power outages in Vi\u00f1ales, La Palma, Bah\u00eda Honda, and San Crist\u00f3bal.[22] Near Havana, a few homes lost their roofs and power was lost to many homes, mostly as a result of a precautionary power shutdown. High winds also downed numerous trees, blocking many roads. Along the coast, rough seas damaged parts of the capital city's seawall. Some streets near the shore were left under 1 to 2\u00a0ft (0.30 to 0.61\u00a0m) of water at the height of the storm. By the afternoon of October\u00a015, emergency crews began clearing debris left behind by the storm.[24] A small portion of banana crops in the Havana area suffered losses.[25] Throughout the country, Paula resulted in relatively little damage.[1] In Florida, a tropical storm watch was issued from Dry Tortugas to Craig Key at 1500\u00a0UTC on October\u00a013. The tropical storm watch was discontinued early on October\u00a015.[1] In the Florida Keys, the outer bands of Paula brought moderate rainfall and increased surf. A total of 1.51\u00a0in (38\u00a0mm) of rain in Key West had fallen between October\u00a013 and 15.[26][27][28] Two waterspouts were reported offshore the Upper Florida Keys on October 14.[29] Following the threat of a landfalling storm in Florida, orange juice futures dropped by 8.9%, reaching their lowest value since September\u00a09. Values for delivery fell to $1.409 a pound (453\u00a0grams) at the worst of the downturn.[30]"

        "content": " During 2015, tropical cyclones formed in seven major bodies of water, commonly known as tropical cyclone basins. Tropical cyclones will be assigned names by various weather agencies if they attain maximum sustained winds of 35 knots (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph). During the year, one hundred thirty-four systems have formed and ninety-two were named. The most intense storm of the year was Hurricane Patricia, with maximum 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 345\u00a0km/h (215\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 872\u00a0hPa (25.75\u00a0inHg). The deadliest tropical cyclone was Cyclone Komen, which caused 280 fatalities in Southeast India and Bangladesh, while the costliest was Typhoon Mujigae, which caused an estimated $4.25 billion USD in damage after striking China. Forty Category 3 tropical cyclones formed, including nine Category 5 tropical cyclones in the year. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for the 2015 (seven basins combined), as calculated by Colorado State University (CSU) was 1047 units. The most active basin in the year was the Eastern Pacific which documented 26\u00a0named systems, was its basin's most active since 1992, despite only amounting to 25 named systems in the Western Pacific. Conversely, both the North Atlantic hurricane and North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons experienced a below average season numbering 11 and 4, respectively. Activity across the southern hemisphere's three basins\u2013South-West Indian, Australian, and South Pacific\u2013was spread evenly, with each region recording seven named storms apiece. That hemisphere's strongest tropical cyclone was Cyclone Pam, which bottomed out with a barometric pressure of 896 mbar (hPa; 26.46\u00a0inHg) in the South-Pacific Ocean. Tropical cyclones are primarily monitored by a group of ten warning centers, which have been designated as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) or a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) by the World Meteorological Organization. These are the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) and Central Pacific Hurricane Center, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR), Indonesia's Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) as well as New Zealand's MetService. Other notable warning centers include the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), and the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center (BNHC)."

        "content": "By January 2015, westerly wind burst activity picked up again. The first Kelvin wave developed around March and another formed around May. In addition, another strong westerly wind burst event took place around July as a result of twin tropical cyclones straddling the equator. An even stronger event in October, and an unusually stronger event during late December 2015 into January 2016, also resulted from twin cyclones on opposite sides of the equator. In May 2015, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology respectively confirmed the arrival of weak El Ni\u00f1o conditions.[1] El Ni\u00f1o conditions were forecast in July to intensify into strong conditions by fall and winter of 2015.[2][3] In addition to the warmer than normal waters generated by the El Ni\u00f1o conditions, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation was also creating persistently higher than normal sea surface temperatures in the northeastern Pacific.[4][5] In August, the NOAA CPC predicted that the 2015 El Ni\u00f1o \"could be among the strongest in the historical record dating back to 1950.\"[6] In mid November, NOAA reported that the temperature anomaly in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region for the 3-month average from August to October 2015 was the 2nd warmest on record with only 1997 warmer.[7] After Typhoon Higos developed during February 2015, a new forecast scenario opened: El Ni\u00f1o might strengthen and persist through 2015.[8] This scenario was supported by the same climate features that had predicted the weak El Ni\u00f1o developing during 2014.[8] During their March 2015 diagnostic discussion, NOAA's CPC and the IRI reported that El Ni\u00f1o conditions had been observed during February 2015, after the above average sea surface temperatures had become weakly coupled with the tropical atmosphere.[9][10] During November and December 2015, values within NOAA's Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index peaked at 2.4\u00a0\u00b0C (4.3\u00a0\u00b0F), which surpassed December 1997 value of 2.2\u00a0\u00b0C (4.0\u00a0\u00b0F).[11][12][13] NOAA subsequently reported that the 3-month average from November 2015 to January 2016 of the ONI had peaked at 2.3\u00a0\u00b0C (4.1\u00a0\u00b0F), which meant that the 2014\u201316 event was tied with the 1997\u201398 event for the strongest values on record.[14] However, overall the event was considered to be one of the three strongest El Nino events since 1950, since there was a number of different ways to measure the strength of an event.[14] The event subsequently started to weaken with sea surface temperature anomalies across the equatorial pacific decreasing, while predictions about a possible La Ni\u00f1a event taking place during 2016 started to be made.[15][16]"

        "header": "Effects",
        "content": "The 2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event influenced tropical cyclone activity around the world, where it contributed to record breaking seasons in the Central Pacific and Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone basins. By contrast, it limited Atlantic hurricane activity, producing strong vertical wind shear, increased atmospheric stability, stronger sinking motion and drier air across the tropical Atlantic.[17] The Central Pacific basin saw its most active tropical cyclone season on record with 16 tropical cyclones recorded during 2015.[17][18] Within the Southern Hemisphere, the El Ni\u00f1o pushed tropical cyclone activity in the South Pacific Ocean eastwards, with activity flourishing near Vanuatu, Fiji and Tonga.[19][20] As a result of this displacement and other factors such as a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, the 2015\u201316 Australian region cyclone season was the least active since reliable records started during the 1950s, with only three named tropical cyclones developing in the region compared to an average of eleven.[19][20][21][22] The event also contributed to six systems forming outside of the season boundaries, within the North Atlantic, Eastern and Southern Pacific basins. These systems included Tropical Cyclone Raquel, which was considered by some to be a part of both the 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316 seasons, but was later deemed to only be a part of the 2014\u201315 season.[23][24] Tropical Depressions 01F and 02F developed in the South Pacific during July and October 2015, which affected Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands.[25][26] Tropical Depression Nine-C subsequently formed in the Central Pacific on 31 December, whose remnants in turn contributed to the development of Hurricane Pali on 7 January. This also caused the latest end and earliest start to the 2015 and 2016 Pacific hurricane seasons, respectively. Other significant tropical cyclones during the event included: Cyclone Pam, which became the second most intense tropical cyclone in the South Pacific in terms of wind speed and devastated Vanuatu; Cyclone Winston, was the most intense tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere and devastated Fiji; Cyclone Fantala, which was the strongest storm in terms of 1-minute and 10-minute sustained winds in the South Indian Ocean; and Hurricane Patricia, which was the second-most-intense tropical cyclone on record globally in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest in terms of 1-minute sustained winds."

        "content": "The season was the last of three consecutive below-average Atlantic hurricane seasons. It was a slightly below average season in which twelve tropical cyclones formed. Eleven of the twelve designated cyclones attained tropical storm status. Of the eight tropical storms, four reached at least Category 1 hurricane intensity. The 2015 season extended the period without major hurricane landfalls in the United States to ten years, with the last such system being Hurricane Wilma in 2005. The lack of activity was primarily attributed to an atmospheric circulation that favored dry, sinking air over low latitudes to the west of 40\u00b0W and westerly wind shear enhanced by El Ni\u00f1o.[27] A few notable events occurred during the season. Ana was the first tropical cyclone to form in the off-season since 2012.[28] Erika became only the second storm in the satellite era to be retired without reaching hurricane strength (Tropical Storm Allison was the first) and only the third to be retired without having made landfall (Hurricanes Klaus and Fabian were the first and second, respectively). Fred was one of the easternmost tropical storms recorded and made landfall in Cape Verde as a Category\u00a01 hurricane, becoming the first hurricane to strike that country since 1892.[29] Joaquin was the most intense storm of non-tropical origin in the satellite era and the strongest to affect the Bahamas in October since 1866. The tropical cyclones of this season caused 89 deaths and at least $731.8\u00a0million in damage.[30] The Atlantic hurricane season officially ended on November 30, 2015.\nTropical cyclogenesis began early, with Ana developing on May\u00a08, over three weeks prior to the official beginning of the season and far ahead of the long-term climatological average of July\u00a09. The month of June featured one tropical cyclone, Bill, which formed on June\u00a016. Claudette, the only system in the month of July, developed on July\u00a013. The rate of tropical cyclogenesis increased in August, though no storms developed in the first half of the month. Danny, the season's first major hurricane, formed on August\u00a016, followed by Erika on August\u00a024, and Fred on August\u00a030. September, which is the climatological peak of hurricane season, featured five additional tropical cyclones \u2013 Grace, Henri, Tropical Depression Nine, Ida, and Joaquin. The most intense storm of the season was Joaquin, which peaked as a strong Category\u00a04 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h), just short of Category\u00a05 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Joaquin lasted into October, though no other systems developed that month. The season's final cyclone, Kate, developed on November\u00a08 and became extratropical on November\u00a011.[27] The season's activity was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) rating of 63, which was well below the 1981\u20132010\u00a0median of 92.[31]"

        "content": "Overall, 31\u00a0tropical cyclones formed, of which 26 reached tropical storm intensity and were named. A total of 16 of these storms became hurricanes, and a record-breaking 11 became major hurricanes.[nb 1] These values make the 2015 season the second-most active on record.[32][33] The Central Pacific, meanwhile, had its most active year on record, with 16 tropical cyclones forming in or entering the basin,[34] easily surpassing the old record of 11 set in 1992 and 1994.[35] The season officially began on May\u00a015 in the Eastern Pacific, and on June\u00a01 in the Central Pacific; the season ended officially on November\u00a030,[36] though a tropical depression formed well after that on December\u00a031. The well-above-average activity levels were largely attributed to the strong 2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event, which brought anomalously high sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear to western parts of the basin.[35][37] In fact, for the region between the 116th meridian west and the International Date Line, sea surface temperatures from July to October averaged 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F), the highest value on record since reliable data records began in 1979.[38] Around Hawaii, sea surface temperatures were 0.9\u00a0\u00b0C (1.6\u00a0\u00b0F) higher than at any point during the past 60 years. Wind shear in the region was also at its lowest on record during that period.[38] The existence of a large region of rising air over the basin during much of the season, a feature typical of El Ni\u00f1o events, further facilitated the development and intensification of the season's numerous tropical cyclones.[37] The season started off with three successive hurricanes, with Andres and Blanca both reaching Category\u00a04 status.[39] On June\u00a03, Blanca became both earliest second hurricane and second major hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1971, and became the earliest instance of a landfall on the Baja California Peninsula. Ten days later, Carlos became the second-earliest third hurricane on record.[40] After about a month of inactivity, eight systems formed in July, including five from July\u00a08\u201312. Ela became the earliest named storm to form in the Central Pacific within the bounds of the official season, and along with Iune and Halola, marked the first month in the satellite era where three tropical cyclones were observed in the Central Pacific.[41][42] Six more systems formed in an active August.[43][44] Early on August\u00a030, Hurricanes Kilo, Ignacio and Jimena intensified into Category\u00a04 hurricanes. This was the first time in the historical record that three or more major hurricanes existed simultaneously in the Pacific east of the International Date Line, and that two or more major hurricanes existed simultaneously in the Central Pacific.[45] September saw the formation of five systems, excluding Kevin which was named in September but formed on August\u00a031.[46][47] Three systems\u2014Linda, Sixteen-E, and Marty\u2014affected Mexico, with the first two also bringing floods to the Southwestern United States. The flood event caused by Linda in Utah was also the state's deadliest. October saw another five systems.[48][49] With the formation of Oho on October\u00a03, the 2015\u00a0season surpassed 1992 and 1994 as the most active year on record in the Central Pacific.[50] During October\u00a018\u201319, Olaf became the southernmost-forming hurricane and major hurricane in the Eastern Pacific. Olaf later became the first system on record to cross from the Eastern Pacific into the Central Pacific and then back into the Eastern Pacific while still a tropical cyclone. Patricia became the strongest hurricane in the basin on October\u00a023 when its pressure fell to 892\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.34\u00a0inHg), breaking the previous record of 902 mbar (hPa; 26.64\u00a0inHg) set by 1997's Hurricane Linda.[51] Patricia subsequently became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere in terms of barometric pressure, with a central pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75\u00a0inHg). This value was also the second-lowest globally, behind Typhoon Tip of 1979 which had a central pressure of 870 mbar (hPa; 25.69\u00a0inHg). Additionally, its maximum sustained winds of 215\u00a0mph (345\u00a0km/h) were the strongest ever reliably recorded or estimated anywhere globally.[52] Patricia later became the strongest Pacific hurricane to strike Mexico after making landfall in Jalisco as a strong Category\u00a04 hurricane.[52] The following month tied for the most active November with the development of two systems, Rick and Sandra.[32][53] Sandra subsequently strengthened into a major hurricane, bringing the season total to a record 11.[32] Its peak winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and minimum central pressure of 934 mbar (hPa; 27.58\u00a0inHg) surpassed Hurricane Kenneth of 2011 for the strongest November Pacific hurricane in terms of both sustained winds and central pressure.[54] Despite the official end of the season on November\u00a030,[36] anomalously favorable conditions in the Central Pacific gave rise to the final storm of the season, Tropical Depression Nine-C, which formed on December\u00a031 and dissipated late the same day. This marked the latest end to a Pacific hurricane season on record.[32]"

        "content": "Most of the 27 tropical cyclones affected Micronesia, because of the record-tying 2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event. 2015 opened with Tropical Depression Jangmi (Seniang) from the previous season active within the Sulu Sea, to the north of Malaysia, on January 1, 2015. The system subsequently moved south-eastward, made landfall on Malaysia, and dissipated later that day. However, the official first tropical cyclone of the season was a minor tropical depression, in the same place where Jangmi persisted on January 2, but dissipated two days later.[55] Tropical Storm Mekkhala, on January 13, developed and approached the Philippines where it caused minor damages and also notably interrupted Pope Francis's visit to the country.[55] In early-February, Typhoon Higos developed further east of the basin and reached peak strength of a Category 4 typhoon. Higos became the strongest typhoon on record in the month of February when it broke the record of Typhoon Nancy (1970),[56] and was in turn surpassed by Typhoon Wutip in 2019. During the opening days of March 2015, a major westerly wind burst occurred, which subsequently contributed to the development of the 2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event and Tropical Storm Bavi.[8] Typhoon Maysak developed and became the most intense pre-April tropical cyclone on record, with maximum 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained winds and a minimum pressure of 910\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg) at its peak intensity.[57] Only one weak system (Haishen) formed in April, which caused little to no damage.[58] In May, two storms, Typhoons Noul and Dolphin, both reached Category 5 super typhoon intensity.[59] Both typhoons affected landmasses and altogether caused about $37.1 million in damages, respectively. Kujira formed in June and made landfall in southeast Asia, bringing flooding.[60] During the first week of July, the tropics rapidly became active, with a trio typhoons developing simultaneously and affecting three different landmasses. Total damages from Chan-hom, Linfa and Nangka nearly reached US$2 billion. Afterwards, Typhoon Halola entered the basin from the Eastern Pacific.[61] In August, Typhoon Soudelor made landfall in Taiwan and China, where it killed 38 people and damages totaled up to US$3.7 billion. Typhoon Goni badly affected the Philippines, the Ryukyu Islands and Kyushu as an intense typhoon, causing about US$293 million in damages.[62] In September, Tropical Storm Etau brought flooding in much of Japan, with damages at least US$100 million. Tropical Storm Vamco made landfall over in Vietnam and caused moderate impact and damages. Typhoon Dujuan, similar to Soudelor, impacted China and Taiwan with total damages of $660 million as a Category 4 super typhoon.[63] In early October, Typhoon Mujigae rapidly intensified into a Category 4 typhoon when it made landfall over Zhanjiang, spawning a tornado causing 29 deaths and over US$4 billion in damages. Later, Typhoon Koppu devastated the Philippines as a super typhoon, causing at least $230 million in damages and killing at least 55 people.[64] Typhoon In-fa became a strong typhoon in November, causing minor impact over in the Caroline Islands.[65] In December, Typhoon Melor maintained Category 4 intensity as it passed the Philippine Islands with 42 deaths and US$140 million in damages, while a tropical depression, named Onyok by PAGASA, made landfall in southern Philippines. The final tropical cyclone of the year developed near Malaysia on December 20, and dissipated three days later.[66]"

        "content": "The season started rather late compared to the last two years, with the first storm, Ashobaa, not developing until June 7. Ashobaa was followed by 2 depressions, before Komen formed in July. Komen produced torrential rainfall in Bangladesh. September featured no storms, before Chapala formed at the end of October. Chapala rapidly intensified over the Arabian Sea into an Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm, becoming the strongest in the Arabian Sea since Gonu in 2007. Chapala also became the only hurricane force system to make landfall in Yemen, and the first since 1922 in Socotra. Chapala was followed by Megh, which reached a weaker intensity in the same general area. Under the influence of an ongoing onset of a southwest monsoon, a low-pressure area formed on June 6. It slowly consolidated, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on June 6.[67] The following day, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued its first advisory for the system, designating it ARB 01. Later the same day, the JTWC reported the storm had reached tropical cyclone intensity, and on June 8, the IMD upgraded the storm to a cyclonic storm, assigning it the name Ashobaa. The storm continued to track northwestwards for a while, before turning westwards and weakening due to moderate to high wind shear and land interaction. Due to most of the moisture being drawn into the storm, the onset of the southwest monsoon over the Indian subcontinent was stalled.[68] Torrential rains fell across much of eastern Oman, with Masirah Island receiving 225\u00a0mm (8.9\u00a0in) of rain in one day and more than 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) overall.[69][70] Significant flooding prompted dozens of evacuations while strong winds caused power outages.[71] Waterlogging was reported in Kalba and Fujairah, in the United Arab Emirates, due to disturbed weather attributed to Ashobaa.[72] An area of low pressure developed off the east coast of India on June 17, about 135\u00a0nmi (250\u00a0km; 155\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Visakhapatnam.[73] Over the next two days, deep convection developed along the southern and western periphery of the centre of the system, predominantly under the influence of the advancing southwest monsoon.[74] Due to the moderate-to-strong wind shear caused by the monsoon, the disturbance failed to develop any further, and the JTWC had reported that it dissipated on June 20.[75] At the same time, however, the IMD started tracking this system as a depression, reporting gusts of up to 35\u00a0kn (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph).[76][77] The depression made landfall over Odisha coast early on June 21, between Gopalpur and Puri.[78] Without any further information, the IMD stopped tracking BOB 01 on June 22.[79] Rough seas from the depression caught many fishing vessels off-guard, with at least 150\u00a0people reported missing offshore on June 21.[80] The vast majority either returned to shore safely or were rescued within a day; however, nine fishermen are feared to have drowned.[81] The entire state of Odisha was put on alert on June 21\u201323. The system brought heavy rains to most of the state, with Malkangiri receiving the highest, 320\u00a0mm (13\u00a0in) of rain.[82] Access to many towns in the Malkangiri district was blocked due to flooding.[83] At least six deaths took place from flood-related incidents.[80] Following the series of monsoonal disturbances, a fresh wave of thunderstorms organized into an area of low pressure on June 21, in the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Gujarat.[84] Deep convection persisted to the west of the system while the circulation continued to develop over the next 24 hours,[85] and the IMD started tracking it as a depression, with the identifier ARB 02.[79] ARB 02 continued to evolve and by the night of June 22, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system, while it was 285\u00a0nmi (528\u00a0km; 328\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Mumbai.[86] Torrential rains battered Gujarat, with peak accumulations of 636\u00a0mm (25.0\u00a0in) in Bagasara, 511\u00a0mm (20.1\u00a0in) in Dhari, and 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) in Variyav. Severe flooding ensued across the region, isolating many villages in the Saurashtra region, and prompted mobilization of the National Disaster Response Force and Indian Air Force.[87] Flooding in the Amreli district was reported to be the worst in 90\u00a0years; 600 of the district's 838\u00a0villages were affected, 400\u00a0of which were rendered inaccessible by land.[88] At least 80\u00a0people died in the region, with Saurashtra suffering the greatest losses.[89] Ten Asiatic lions, an endangered species with only 523\u00a0living individuals documented in May 2015, died during the floods while more than a dozen remain missing.[90][91] The Gujarat government estimated damage at \u20b916.5\u00a0billion (US$258\u00a0million); however, Congress MLA Paresh Dhanani claimed damage to be as high as \u20b970\u00a0billion (US$1.09\u00a0billion).[92] At 03:00 UTC (08:30 AM IST) on July 10, a depression formed over land over Jharkhand, close to Ranchi. It drifted in a generally northwestward direction and dissipated early on July 12 over the periphery of Uttar Pradesh and adjoining areas of Haryana. The system produced extremely heavy downpours, breaking the record in the city of Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh for the maximum amount of rainfall in 24 hours. The city received 191\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of rainfall in a day breaking the previous record of 149.9\u00a0mm (6\u00a0in) which was set around the same period in 1947. The rainfall received was also more than 75% of the average monthly rainfall of 250.7\u00a0mm (10\u00a0in) in the city.[93] In Odisha, at least 14 villages were inundated by floods directly linked to the depression. The Hirakud Dam authorities had announced that they would be releasing waters on July 13 from the river Mahanadi.[94] The states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana also received torrential rains from the system.[95] On July 26 a depression formed inland over the Ganges delta. Early on July 30, the system was upgraded to a cyclonic storm by the IMD and named as Komen while making a U-turn. On August 2, Komen was no longer a tropical cyclone.[96] Torrential rains impacted much of Myanmar, causing widespread flooding. At least 46\u00a0people were killed and more than 200,000 were affected.[97] Additionally, at least 17,000\u00a0homes were destroyed.[98][99] Tremendous rains fell across southeastern Bangladesh, with accumulations Komen and the monsoonal system it originated from reaching 1,051.2\u00a0mm (41.39\u00a0in) in Chittagong.[100] The resulting floods killed at least 23\u00a0people and affected more than 130,400.[101][102] A landslide in the Bandarban District killed six people.[103] Flooding in Odisha, India, killed five people and affected at least 480,399.[104] At least 69\u00a0people died across West Bengal from various incidents directly and indirectly to the storm, such as electrocution and snake bites. A total of 272,488\u00a0homes were destroyed while a further 55,899\u00a0sustained damage.[105][106] At least 21\u00a0people died in Manipur, 20\u00a0of whom perished in a landslide that struck Joumol village.[107] A trough over Madhya Pradesh drifted westwards into eastern Rajasthan and lead to the formation of an area of low pressure in its vicinity on July 24. Continuing on its westward track, the system became more organised and intensified into a depression on July 27, to the west of Jodhpur. A western disturbance over Pakistan and adjoining areas of Jammu and Kashmir kept the system from moving further north into drier portions of Rajasthan. This allowed it to intensify further into a deep depression, about 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) southeast of Barmer. However, the system accelerated in a chiefly northward track on July 29, absorbing dry air along its path. It weakened rapidly and dissipated to the north of Bikaner on the following day.[108] Heavy rainfall brought by the system lead to flash flooding in districts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Chief Minister of Gujarat Anandiben Patel ordered rescue teams to carry out relief activities in Kutch, Patan, Banaskantha, and other districts of the state, as a result.[109] A depression forms in Madhya Pradesh on 4 August and has a maximum winds of 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph). One day later it weakened as well marked low-pressure area. It made its impact in Madhya Pradesh.[110] In early October, a low-pressure area formed over the Arabian Sea. It slowly consolidated, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA on October 7. On October 9, the IMD started issuing its advisories for the system, designating it ARB 03. During the late hours of October 9, the JTWC stated the storm had reached gale-force winds, and commenced its advisories. On the following day, the depression intensified into a Deep depression, reaching its peak intensity with sustained wind speeds at 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure estimated near 1,001\u00a0mbar (29.56\u00a0inHg). On the following days, the storm followed a generally northwestward track, where it encountered areas having low mid-to-upper level moisture in the atmosphere. The system struggled to maintain its intensity and weakened, prompting the JTWC to issue its final warning on ARB 03 in the morning of October 11. On next day, IMD reported that the storm had degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure area. The storm, being over water during its entire lifespan, did not directly impact any landmass. However, under the influence of the storm's rain bands, heavy Rains lashed the Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, India. The reservoir of Chittar I, a dam near Kanyakumari, recorded 216.4\u00a0mm (8.52\u00a0in) of rainfall.[111] A low-pressure area formed over the Arabian Sea on October 26.[112] It slowly consolidated, prompting the IMD to classify it a depression on October 28.[113] Later the same day, the JTWC issued its Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system, and the IMD upgraded the storm to deep depression intensity.[114][115] Further intensification ensued, causing the IMD to upgrade the system to a cyclonic storm, naming it Chapala.[116] Over the following hours, the storm intensified into a severe cyclonic storm and further into a very severe cyclonic storm.[117][118] Rapid intensification commenced and Chapala was upgraded into an extremely severe cyclonic storm on October 30.[119] On November 3, it made landfall in Yemen as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the first tropical cyclone at hurricane intensity to make landfall in the country on record.[120] Chapala rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of mainland Yemen and was last noted as a low-pressure area the following day. Chapala caused widespread damage in mainland Yemen, Socotra and the Puntland region of Somalia. High winds, strong waves, and heavy rainfall affected the southern Yemen coast, with areas in the region receiving 610\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) of rainfall over 48 hours, or 700% of the average yearly precipitation. The storm caused severe flooding along the coast, including in Mukalla, the nation's fifth largest city, where the seafront was destroyed by waves exceeding 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft). While passing north of Socotra, Chapala brought heavy rainfall and high winds while inundating the northeastern part of the island. Large swells produced by Chapala caused extensive coastal damage in eastern Puntland, with multiple structures, boats, and roads destroyed. An Iranian vessel capsized offshore on November 1, killing one person.[citation needed] A low-pressure area consolidated into a depression on November 5.[121] It intensified further, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA and the IMD to upgrade it into a deep depression.[122][123] In the following days, the storm's convection flourished as environmental conditions recuperated. By November 8, Megh rapidly intensified into a marginal Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm, peaking with winds exceeding 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 964\u00a0mbar (28.47\u00a0inHg). Maintaining intensity, the storm made its first landfall over Socotra and headed west, skirting the northern tip of Somalia. Megh took a west-northwestward turn, and made its second landfall over the coast of Yemen on November 10 and weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area over mainland Yemen. Megh's landfall over the island of Socotra as a Category 3-equivalent storm caused extensive devastation, killing at least eighteen people and injuring dozens of others.[124] Another six people were left missing on the island. More than 500 houses were completely destroyed and another 3,000 were damaged.[125] In addition, hundreds of fishing boats were damaged and more than 3,000 families were displaced as a result of Megh.[126][127] A low-pressure area consolidated into a depression on November 8. It slowly intensified, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system, but was eventually cancelled despite the improving appearance prior to landfall. The IMD later upgraded the system to a deep depression before it crossed the coast of Tamil Nadu near Puducherry the following day with peak wind speeds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 991\u00a0hPa (29.26\u00a0inHg). Due to land interaction and high vertical wind shear, the system weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area over north Tamil Nadu on November 10. The storm brought heavy rainfall over the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu. Neyveli, a mining township southwest of Puducherry, recorded 139\u00a0mm (5.5\u00a0in) of rainfall on November 9 and 483\u00a0mm (19.0\u00a0in) of rainfall on November 10[128] of which 450\u00a0mm (18\u00a0in) fell within a span of 9 hours.[129] At least 71\u00a0people were killed in various incidents, predominately related to flooding, across Tamil Nadu.[130][131]"

        "content": "On January\u00a09, the MFR upgraded a low-pressure system east of Madagascar to a zone of disturbed weather, and the system became a tropical disturbance late on the next day.[132][133] On January\u00a011, the MFR upgraded the system to a tropical depression. Later that day, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm, receiving the name Bansi, whilst the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm. In the next day, the MFR upgraded Bansi to a tropical cyclone, as the system formed a ragged eye.[134][135][136] On January\u00a013, Bansi explosively intensified into a Category\u00a05 cyclone. However, it soon weakened to a Category\u00a02 on the SSHWS (intense tropical cyclone for MFR) due to an eyewall replacement cycle.[137] It re-intensified slowly to a Category\u00a04 on the SSHWS as it moved East-Southeast until January\u00a013. Then it slowly curved Southeast and impacted Rodrigues on January 14.[citation needed] Approximately 90\u00a0percent of the island was left without power as a result of the storm. Some flooding occurred and 115\u00a0people sought refuge in shelters.[138] From this moment onwards it started weakening gradually at first, but then deteriorated quickly.[139] On January\u00a016, Bansi began to undergo an extratropical transition. Consequently, the MFR and JTWC issued Bansi's final warning, as Bansi was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone to the northeast.[citation needed] On January 11, the JTWC started to monitor a weak tropical disturbance inland over Mozambique. On January 14, the MFR upgraded a low-pressure system east of Mozambique to a zone of disturbed weather, and the system became a tropical disturbance late on the same day. On January 15, the MFR upgraded the system to a tropical depression. Later next day, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm, receiving the name Chedza, whilst the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm. On the same day, MFR upgraded it to a Severe Tropical Storm. Later that day, it made landfall over Madagascar. On January 17, it left Madagascar and went to the South-West Indian Ocean. On the next day, it re-intensified to a Severe Tropical Storm. On January 19, Chedza began to undergo an extratropical transition. Consequently, the MFR issued Chedza's final warning.[citation needed] The formative stages of Chedza brought rainfall to an already flooded region across southeastern Africa.[140] Weeks of heavy rainfall killed 117\u00a0people in Mozambique and 104 in neighboring Malawi, where it was the worst floods in 24\u00a0years.[141][142][143] In Madagascar, Chedza struck after weeks of heavy rainfall,[144] causing rivers to increase and flooding widespread areas of crop fields.[145][146] In the capital city of Antananarivo, the deluge damaged the main water pump that controlled water levels in the region.[147] The rainfall caused mudslides and damaged roads.[145][148] Across the country, flooding from Chedza displaced 54,792\u00a0people, after destroying 4,430\u00a0houses and flooding another 3,442, mostly in Vatovavy-Fitovinany in the southeastern portion.[145] Chedza killed 80\u00a0people and caused about $40\u00a0million in damage (2015\u00a0USD).[140][141] Later, the storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the mountainous peaks of R\u00e9union.[149] On January\u00a026, a tropical low formed east-southeast of Diego Garcia. It slowly moved towards it, before the MFR upgraded the low into a zone of disturbed weather. Later that day, the area of disturbed weather intensified into a depression, as the MFR and JTWC issued their initial advisories, and designated it as 08S. On January\u00a027, MFR reported that Tropical Depression 08S intensified into a moderate tropical storm, and so was issued the name Diamondra. Later that day, Diamondra continued to strengthen, and late on January\u00a028, Diamondra reached moderate tropical storm intensity. Diamondra weakened, after moving over cooler waters. Late on January\u00a029, Diamondra continued to weaken, so JTWC issued Diamondra's final warning. On January\u00a030, Diamondra began to undergo an extratropical transition. Two days later, it was reported that Diamondra had become extratropical, and MFR announced their final advisory on the system soon after.[citation needed] On January 27, RSMC La R\u00e9union reported that Tropical Disturbance 08, had developed to the northeast of Mauritius.[150] Later that day, the JTWC issued its initial warnings and designated it as 09S. On January\u00a028, MFR reported that Tropical Depression 09S intensified into a moderate tropical storm, as MFR named it Eunice. Then Eunice moved from north to southeast, before Eunice intensified into a severe tropical storm, according to MFR. The JTWC upgraded Eunice into a Category\u00a02 tropical cyclone, while the MFR upgraded Eunice to a tropical cyclone. After a period of rapid intensification, Eunice was classified as a very intense tropical cyclone by the MFR and a Category\u00a05  (1 min 260 kmh)-equivalent tropical cyclone by the JTWC. The next day, Eunice weakened to an intense tropical cyclone as it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. On February 2, Eunice began to undergo an extratropical transition. One day later, MFR announced their final advisory on the system.[citation needed] Similar to the formation of Chedza, a weak tropical disturbance developed near shore over southern Mozambique on February 4. On February 5, the MFR upgraded a low-pressure system east of Mozambique to a zone of disturbed weather. On February 6, the MFR upgraded the system to a tropical depression. Later same day, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm, receiving the name Fundi, whilst the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm. Fundi weakened, after moving over cooler waters. Late on February 8, Fundi continued to weaken, so JTWC issued Fundi's final warning. On February 9, Fundi began to undergo an extratropical transition. Same day later, it was reported that Fundi had become extratropical, and MFR announced their final advisory on the system soon after.[citation needed] While in its formative stages, the storm brought rainfall to southwestern Madagascar, totaling 109\u00a0mm (4.3\u00a0in) in Tulear.[141] Severe floods impacted the city of Toliara, killing five people and affecting 1,200\u00a0homes.[151] The effects of Fundi in Madagascar worsened the situation in areas still recovering from Severe Tropical Storm Chedza the previous month.[152] On February 22, a tropical low formed on open seas of the Indian Ocean east of Diego Garcia. It moved westwards, before the MFR upgraded it into a zone of disturbed weather. Then it got upgraded into Tropical Disturbance 10 later.[citation needed] The disturbance continued to move in a westerly direction as the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system.[153] On February 24, the system gradually intensified into a tropical depression, whilst the JTWC upgraded it into a tropical storm. However, the MFR upgraded the depression into a moderate tropical storm, which was then named Glenda. It intensified slightly because of favourable conditions for further development, within moderate vertical wind shear. On February 25, the storm continued to intensify, and it reached peak intensity. It quickly weakened the next day, and continued to weaken on February 28, and it lost its energy on March 1. Thereafter, MFR announced their final advisory on the system soon after.[154] On March 5, the JTWC started issuing advisories on a tropical system over the Mozambique Channel and was designated as 15S. The next day, RSMC La R\u00e9union reported that it had intensified into Tropical Depression 11. On March 7, the system moved in a westward direction and near shore. With this, the MFR downgraded it to a tropical disturbance again on the same day, with the JTWC downgrading it to a tropical depression and issued its final warning. It continued to weaken on the next day, so MFR announced their final advisory on the system soon after.[citation needed] On March 7, a tropical disturbance formed east of Madagascar. It intensified into a zone of disturbed weather and became a tropical disturbance. It became Tropical Depression 12 by MFR, within the JTWC's designation 16S on March 8, and became Moderate Tropical Storm Haliba. The next day, Haliba continued to intensify.[citation needed] During the early stages of Haliba's development it produced heavy rains across eastern Madagascar, resulting in severe flooding. A total of 26\u00a0people died on the island while approximately 96,000\u00a0people were affected, 39,000\u00a0of whom were rendered homeless. Roughly 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of rice fields were destroyed.[155] Torrential rains also affected Mauritius for three days, leading to damaging floods.[156] A 24\u2011hour rainfall of 135.6\u00a0mm (5.34\u00a0in) was observed at Ganga Talao.[157] While passing near R\u00e9union, the cyclone produced torrential rain over the northern areas of the island. Total accumulations peaked at 796\u00a0mm (31.3\u00a0in) in Salazie. Although heavy, the rains were noted as normal for a tropical cyclone. Wind gusts were not as strong as initially forecast and did not exceed 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph); a peak gust of 91\u00a0km/h (57\u00a0mph) was measured in Bellevue Bras Panon.[158] Agricultural damage in the region amounted to \u20ac6\u00a0million (US$6.4\u00a0million).[159] On April 1, the MFR began to monitor Tropical Disturbance 13 several miles southeast of Diego Garcia. Post-storm analysis determined that it did not develop until April 2. Joalane rapidly intensified into a Tropical Cyclone strength system and reached peak intensity. Afterwards, Joalane kept strength while accelerating southward. Joalane became a remnant low late on April 11. The remnant low continued south until it degenerated to a trough by strong wind shear.[160] On 6 April, the BoM had reported that Ikola had entered the basin as a severe tropical cyclone from the Southwest Indian Ocean basin and was designated as 19U. Ikola rapidly weakened due to moving into a region of increasing wind shear, becoming a category 3 tropical cyclone by the evening of 7\u00a0April. Along with decreasing sea surface temperatures and further increases of wind shear caused Ikola to weaken more to a tropical low on the afternoon of 8\u00a0April. The low then proceeded to become a trough system, bringing heavy rainfall to the southwestern parts of Western Australia and severe storms to the southeast of Western Australia. Ikola soaked Central Western Australia and affected Perth from 6\u201312 April. Ikola was also the first cyclone to move into the Australian basin from the Southwest Indian Ocean basin since Cyclone Alenga in 2011."

        "content": "The season started on November 19, with the formation of Annabelle.[161] After a month of inactivity, Bohale formed, but was fairly weak and only reached moderate tropical cyclone strength.[162] M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France first noted a zone of disturbed weather about 930\u00a0km (580\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Diego Garcia on November 18. It was designated as a tropical disturbance the next day, and upgraded to a tropical depression shortly thereafter.[161] On November 20, the system's organization continued to improve with tight convective banding and it was upgraded to moderate tropical storm status about 270\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) south of Diego Garcia.[163] The system was not named Annabelle operationally until early the next day.[164] Annabelle intensified slowly for several days as it drifted south-southeast.[161] The system accelerated to the southeast and developed an eye feature.[165] Annabelle became a severe tropical storm early on November 23,[161] benefiting from strong upper level divergence aloft.[165] Six hours later, Annabelle reached its peak intensity of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[161] By November 24, Annabelle's convection became disorganized as a result of increased wind shear induced by an upper level trough and cooler ocean temperatures and it was declared post-tropical.[166] The remnants of Annabelle weakened in the following days until it dissipated during November 27.[161] On December 3, a disorganized area of convection developed over the equatorial regions of the central Indian Ocean.[167] The system tracked generally southwest until it intensified into Tropical Depression 02 on December 10.[162] The tropical depression gradually turned to the south-southwest and exhibited weak convection, leaving the system exposed as it struggled to intensify within a dry air mass.[168] It received the name Bohale from the Mauritius Meteorological Services early on December 11 when it was operationally determined to have become a moderate tropical storm.[169] In post-season re-analysis, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France determined that Bohale became a tropical storm a day later, on December 12.[162] Bohale maintained its peak intensity of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) as a moderate tropical storm for 18 hours, before transitioning into a post-tropical depression at 18 UTC while retaining its gale-force winds.[162] The post-tropical remnants of Bohale tracked south slowly until they dissipated on December 16.[162]"

        "content": "On 2 January, TCWC Perth and Darwin started to monitor Tropical Low 05U, that had developed within the monsoon trough near Wyndham in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.[170][171] Over the next few days, the low moved slowly towards the southwest and passed to the southeast of Derby during 6 and 7 January. On 8\u00a0January, the low began a southward track before tracking to the east on 9\u00a0January. During the same day, the low moved south of Fitzroy Crossing and south of Halls Creek later in the evening. The system crossed into the Northern Territory early on 10\u00a0January before dissipating later that day. In total, over 1000mm of rain was recorded over inland communities due to 05U.[172] On 10 January, TCWC Brisbane reported that Tropical Low 06U had developed within the monsoon trough, within an unfavorable environment for further development to the northeast of Queensland.[173] Over the next couple of days, the system moved southeastwards and may have influenced the track of Tropical Low 07U, before it was last noted during 13 January.[174][175] During 17 January, a tropical low that had been monitored by the BoM for a few days, moved into the Northern Kimberley region from the Northern Territory.[176] Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-westwards over land before it moved offshore and into the Indian Ocean near Broome during 19 January.[176] As computer models were predicting conditions surrounding the low to be marginally favourable for further development, TCWC Perth expected the system to develop into a tropical cyclone and issued tropical cyclone advice for coastal areas from Kuri Bay to Exmouth.[176] However, as the system spent more time over land than had been forecasted and vertical wind shear did not weaken as much as forecasted.[176] As a result, the system failed to develop into a tropical cyclone as it moved south-westwards towards the Pilbara coast before it dissipated near Port Hedland during 20 January.[176] Cyclone Lam was the strongest storm to strike Australia's Northern Territory since Cyclone Monica in 2006. It formed from the monsoon trough on 12 February in the Coral Sea. For much of its duration, the system moved westward due to a ridge to the south. The system crossed over the Cape York Peninsula and moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, whereupon it gradually organized due to warm waters and favorable outflow. On 16 February, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) classified it as a Category 1 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and gave it the name Lam. The storm intensified further while drifting toward the Wessel Islands, developing an eye and strengthening to the equivalence of a minimal hurricane on 18 February. It strengthened to reach maximum sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) early on 19 February before turning to the southwest, making it a Category 4 cyclone. That day, it made landfall on Northern Territory between Milingimbi and Elcho Island at peak intensity, and it rapidly weakened over land. About six hours after Lam moved ashore, Cyclone Marcia struck Queensland as a Category 5 cyclone, marking the first time on record that two storms of Category 4 intensity struck Australia on the same day. In its formative stages, Lam produced heavy rainfall and flooding in Far North Queensland. Later, the cyclone's rainfall set daily precipitation records in Northern Territory. However, the winds caused the most damage, with gusts estimated as high as 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph). The highest gust was 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) at Cape Wessel on Rimbija Island. Lam caused considerable destruction, particularly affecting local aboriginal communities. Total damage in the Northern Territory reached at least A$82.4 million (US$64.3 million). On 16 February, the BoM started to monitor a weak tropical disturbance in the Coral Sea. It quickly developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on 18 February, earning the name Marcia. It was upgraded to Category 2 the following day when it was approximately 555 kilometres (345\u00a0mi) north of Bundaberg and again upgraded to Category 3 severe tropical cyclone when approximately 290 kilometres (180\u00a0mi) north of Yeppoon. On 19 February, due to a developing, clear eye, the JTWC upgraded Marcia to a Category 2 whilst the BoM upgraded it as a Category 4. Due to explosive intensification, Marcia became a Category 5 according to the BoM early on 20 February. It affected Queensland, and last noted on 26th of the same month as it dissipated, west-southwest of New Caledonia. The boat of two fishermen traveling to Fraser Island sank due to rough seas on the morning of 19 February, however, they were found safe and well on nearby Moon Boom Island the next morning.[177] The storm wrought extensive damage in Queensland, with losses amounting to A$750\u00a0million (US$590.5\u00a0million).[178] On 8 March, the BoM started to monitor a weak tropical low over Western Australia. The system was later designated as 16U a few days later. Due to an increase in convection, both the BoM and JTWC upgraded the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, naming it Olwyn on 11 March. Just before 12 March, Olwyn rapidly developed a ragged eye, as the BoM upgraded the system to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone. Early on 13 March, Olwyn reached its peak strength of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) as the JTWC classified it as a Category 2 cyclone. However, after a few hours, the JTWC downgraded it to a Category 1 cyclone as it weakened from land interaction. On the same day, Olwyn made landfall over southwestern Australia as a weakening cyclone. Rapidly weakening inland, it emerged on the Southern Ocean as a decaying remnant low. It dissipated onwards. Olwyn caused extensive damage along the coast of Western Australia, from Onslow to Kalbarri. In preparation for the storm, the Pilbara Ports authority closed the ports of Dampier and Ashburton.[179] The entire workforce on Barrow Island was evacuated to the island's cyclone shelter. 128\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) wind gusts and 141.6\u00a0mm (5.57\u00a0in) of rain was recorded on the island as it was brushed by Olwyn.[180] Upon landfall, a maximum wind gust of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) was recorded at Learmonth.[181] Moderate property damage occurred at nearby Exmouth, with several houses being inundated with floodwater after 141.8\u00a0mm (5.58\u00a0in) of rain fell in 24 hours.[179] Trees were uprooted and power was cut for several days.[179][182] The Exmouth Yacht Club sustained heavy damage from Olwyn's storm surge.[179] Damage was more severe further south at Carnarvon where most houses are not built to cyclone standards, unlike in Exmouth.[182] Olwyn passed over the town at category 3 status, unroofing and severely damaging multiple houses, while many sheds and outbuildings were totally destroyed.[182][183] The town's water and power facilities were damaged, leaving the area without water and electricity supplies for days.[183] The entire banana crop in the Carnarvon area was destroyed by the storm's high winds and flooding.[183] The Gascoyne River experienced its most severe flood since 2010 due to rains from Olwyn.[183] One person sustained life-threatening injuries in a storm-related car accident, he was later on pronounced dead when he died in hospital from his injuries. Total damage in Carnarvon was estimated to be in excess of A$100\u00a0million (US$76.3\u00a0million),[184] and Olwyn has been noted as the most severe cyclone to have hit the town since 1950.[182] A total of 121.8\u00a0mm (4.80\u00a0in) of rain fell in 24 hours at Shark Bay from Olwyn, setting a record for the highest amount of rainfall recorded in March at what is normally the most arid place on the Australian coast.[185] Minor property and tree damage occurred in Denham.[182] Further south, 8\u00a0mm (0.31\u00a0in) of rain and 76\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) wind gusts were reported in Geraldton.[186] The remnant low of Olwyn caused 15\u201325\u00a0mm (0.59\u20130.98\u00a0in) of rain across the Wheatbelt, which was beneficial for farmers in the area. Perth recorded 12.8\u00a0mm (0.50\u00a0in) of rain and cooler temperatures as Olwyn's remnants moved into the Southern Ocean. On 15 March Olwyn's remnants brought severe storms to the Southern Western Australia. Olwyn was the first ex-tropical cyclone to affect Geraldton, the Wheatbelt region and Perth since  Cyclone Iggy in 2012.[187] Shortly after Cyclone Pam was classified on the South Pacific, the outer rainbands of Pam led to the formation of a tropical low near Australia on 9\u00a0March. Later that day, the BoM designated the system as 17U and intensified into Tropical Cyclone Nathan several hours later. It slowly executed a cyclonic loop over the next few days, moving across Arnhem Land.[188] After intensifying to an initial peak intensity of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), Nathan weakened while crossing the Cape York Peninsula and reintensified over the Gulf of Carpentaria. It impacted Arnhem Land as an equivalent of a Category 1 cyclone, before hitting Darwin, Northern Territory the same day. It dissipated afterwards. The remnants of Nathan brought 106\u00a0mm (4.2\u00a0in) of rainfall to Onslow, Western Australia on 30 March. Cyclone Nathan hit the Arnhem Land one month after Cyclone Lam.[citation needed] Total damage in northern Queensland were about A$74.8\u00a0million (US$57\u00a0million).[189] On 6 April, the BoM had reported that Ikola had entered the basin as a severe tropical cyclone from the Southwest Indian Ocean basin and was designated as 19U. Ikola rapidly weakened due to moving into a region of increasing wind shear, becoming a category 3 tropical cyclone by the evening of 7\u00a0April. Along with decreasing sea surface temperatures and further increases of wind shear caused Ikola to weaken more to a tropical low on the afternoon of 8\u00a0April. The low then proceeded to become a trough system, bringing heavy rainfall to the southwestern parts of Western Australia and severe storms to the southeast of Western Australia. Ikola soaked Central Western Australia and affected Perth from 6\u201312 April. Ikola was also the first cyclone to move into the Australian basin from the Southwest Indian Ocean basin since Cyclone Alenga in 2011. On 27 April, the BoM started to monitor a tropical low over Western Australia that had formed from a monsoon trough. Later that day, the system gradually intensified as it was designated as 21U. The next day, 21U intensified into Tropical Cyclone Quang. Quang proceeded to intensify rapidly during 29 and 30 April, reaching a maximum intensity of a category 4 severe tropical cyclone. Quang was located 600\u00a0km northwest of the North West Cape region before turning in a southeast direction. Quang moved southeast during 1\u00a0May while rapidly weakening due to an increase of wind shear, disrupting the cyclones structure in the process. Quang was downgraded to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone in the morning of 1\u00a0May and continued to weaken during the course of the day, becoming a Category 1 before making landfall near the Exmouth coast on the night of 1 May and quickly weakened to a tropical low after it hit Exmouth. It dissipated thereafter. Quang did minimal damage to Exmouth, Western Australia.[190] Late on 30 June, Tropical Depression 17F moved into the Australian region from the South Pacific and intensified gradually into Tropical Cyclone Raquel. After drifting for the next two days, it exited the basin, moving back into the South Pacific. However, Raquel re-entered the basin early on 4 July as a weakening depression. The next day, Raquel was declared a remnant low. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, it is the only known instance of a tropical cyclone during July in the region since the satellite era began (since at least 1970).[191] As a byproduct of becoming a tropical cyclone on the first day of the new cyclone year, it marked the earliest start to a season in the basin on record.[192]"

The system subsequently approached Darwin during 24 December, where it was causing near gale-force winds offshore. On 26 December, 05U was embedded within a monsoon, giving a potential of intensifying into a tropical cyclone.[201] A couple of days later, 05U drifted southeastwards towards land and failed to reach tropical cyclone intensity.[202] The system was last noted on 2 January while it was located over the Simpson Desert in Queensland, as it was not clear if the low continued towards the east coast or another system had developed.[199] A low-pressure developed east of the 90th meridian east or the border of the basin on 26 December, and had a moderate chance of intensifying into a tropical cyclone.[203] TCWC Perth later classified it as a weak tropical low with the identifier of 06U.[204] On 28 December, as the low slowly moved south, unfavorable environments hinder the chance of being a cyclone.[205] TCWC Perth made its final bulletin of the tropical low as it slowly drifted west on 29 December.[206]"

        "content": "During January 19, RSMC Nadi reported that Tropical Disturbance 06F had developed, to the northeast of Papeete on the French Polynesian island of Tahiti.[207] The system lay under an upper-level ridge of high pressure in an environment, which was favorable for further development with low to moderate vertical windshear.[207][208] As a result, the organisation of the atmospheric convection surrounding the system significantly improved, while the systems low level circulation centre rapidly consolidated over the next day. As a result, late on January 20, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system an assigned it the designation 07P. RSMC Nadi subsequently reported that the system had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Niko.[209][210] Over the next two days the system gradually intensified further and became a category 2 tropical cyclone early on January 22. It was downgraded to a depression on 24 January.[211] On January 25, Niko completed its extratropical transition.[citation needed] Late on January 27, RSMC Nadi reported that Tropical Disturbance 08F had developed about 275\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Apia, Samoa.[212] During January 29, RSMC Nadi reported that Tropical Depression 09F had moved into the basin, from the Australian region to the northwest of New Caledonia.[213] The system was moving towards the east-northeast and lay within an area of low vertical wind shear underneath an upper-level ridge of high pressure.[213] During January 30 the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and assigned it the designation Tropical Cyclone 10P. RSMC Nadi subsequently reported that the system had become a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Ola. Over the next two days the system gradually intensified further and became a category 3 severe tropical cyclone early on February 1.[citation needed] On February 2, RSMC Nadi reported that Tropical Disturbance 10F had developed about 680\u00a0km (425\u00a0mi) to the northeast of Suva, Fiji.[214] Over the next day the system moved south-eastwards in an area of low to moderate vertical windshear, before it was last noted during February 4, after the low level circulation centre had become exposed.[215] Tropical Disturbance 13F developed within an area of low vertical windshear, to the north of the island of Papeete on the French Polynesian island of Tahiti during March 19.[216] Over the next few days the system moved westwards and remained poorly organised, with atmospheric convection persistent over the systems supposed low level circulation centre.[216][217] The system was subsequently last noted during March 21, while it was located to the north of Rarotonga in the Southern Cook Islands.[217] During April 15, RSMC Nadi reported that Tropical Depression 16F, had developed about 450\u00a0km (280\u00a0mi) to the northwest of Port Vila, Vanuatu.[218] During that day the system moved westwards and was last noted as it moved into the Australian region during April 16.[219] During May 12, the BoM started to monitor a westward-moving tropical low that had developed near the Solomon Islands, before it moved out of the basin during the next day.[220][221] During March 6, RSMC Nadi reported that Tropical Disturbance 11F had developed about 1,140\u00a0km (710\u00a0mi) to the northwest of Nadi, Fiji.[222] The disturbance continued on its southwestward track until two days later, when the RSMC had upgraded it to a tropical depression.[223] The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA).[224] Cyclone Pam developed out of this system on March 9, when RSMC Nadi started tracking it as a Category 1 tropical cyclone. Located in an area of favourable conditions, Pam gradually intensified into a powerful Category 5 severe tropical cyclone by March 12. Pam's ten-minute maximum sustained winds peaked at 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), along with a minimum pressure of 896 hPa, making Pam the most intense tropical cyclone of the basin since Zoe in 2002.[225] Several hours later, the cyclone began to curve towards the south-southeast, allowing Pam to pass just east of Efate,[226] becoming the single worst natural disaster in the history of Vanuatu.[227] The cyclone crippled Vanuatu's infrastructure: an estimated 90\u00a0percent of the nation's buildings were impacted by the storm's effects, telecommunications were paralyzed, and water shortages took place.[citation needed] The FMS estimated Pam as having record-breaking 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph) ten-minute sustained winds.[228] The storm's winds gradually slowed afterwards as Pam tracked west of Tafea. However, the FMS indicated that the cyclone's pressure dropped further to a minimum of 896 mbar (hPa; 26.46\u00a0inHg) on March\u00a014.[229] Pam left the FMS area of responsibility as it progressed along its path, the storm's eye faded away and Pam's low level circulation became displaced from its associated thunderstorms, signalling a rapid weakening phase.[230] Later on March 15, both agencies discontinued issuing advisories as Pam entered a phase of extratropical transition while affecting northeastern New Zealand.[citation needed] On March 19, RSMC Nadi had reported that Tropical Disturbance 12F had developed about 375\u00a0km (235\u00a0mi) to the southwest of Apia on the Samoan island of Upolu.[216] The system moved southwards as it was classified as a tropical depression. On March 21, the JTWC classified 12F as a tropical storm, giving the designation 20P. Early on March 22, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Reuben, while it was located about 220\u00a0km (135\u00a0mi) to the south of Nuku\u02bbalofa, Tonga.[231] Early on March 23, both agencies discontinued issuing advisories as Reuben entered a phase of extratropical transition.[citation needed] Between March 20\u201322, Reuben's precursor tropical depression produced heavy rain and strong winds over Fiji's Lau Islands.[232] The depression was last noted by the FMS during March 31, while it was located about 600\u00a0km (375\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands.[233] Tropical Depression 15F developed within the monsoon trough during April 9, about 465\u00a0km (290\u00a0mi) to the south of Honiara in the Solomon Islands.[234][235] The system was located under an upper-level ridge of high pressure and in a region favouring further development, including low vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures of above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).[234][236][237] As a result, the system rapidly developed during that day as it moved southwards, with atmospheric convection wrapping into the systems low level circulation centre.[236][237] During the next day the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 23P, while the FMS reported that the system had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Solo.[237][238] The system continued to intensify during that day, before both the JTWC and the FMS reported that Solo had peaked with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) during April 11, which made it a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale.[239][240] Turning to the south-southeast, Solo entered an area of strong vertical wind shear and subsequently weakened.[235][240] During April 12, Solo passed about 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) to the northeast of the Belep Islands, as it moved between New Caledonia's mainland and the Loyalty Islands.[235][238] Solo was subsequently declassified as a tropical cyclone later that day, after it had lost the characteristics of a tropical cyclone.[238] Within the Solomon Islands, the Makira \u2013 Ereteria river was flooded during April 7, while flash flooding destroyed food gardens, bananas and cocoa beans.[241] As it impacted New Caledonia, Solo caused wind gusts of up to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph), while rainfall totals of up to 222\u00a0mm (8.7\u00a0in) were recorded in New Caledonia.[235] As an indirect effect of Solo significant damage was recorded in New Caledonia, with road impassable in places and the drinking water deteriorated in the municipality of Pou\u00e9bo.[235] After the season had ended, researchers identified that a possible subtropical or tropical cyclone, had existed to the northeast of Easter Island between April 29 \u2013 May 4 and unofficially named it Katie.[242] The system originated within a frontal zone during the later part of April, before it developed into a nonfrontal system during April 29.[242] At this time the majority of atmospheric convection associated with the system was located to the southeast of its low level circulation centre.[242] Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-eastwards and gradually developed further because it was an El nino year and before it developed into a subtropical storm during May 1.[242] The system subsequently moved north-westwards and degenerated into a remnant low on May 4, before it dissipated during May 6.[242] It was unofficially named due to it forming in an area that is not warm enough to support tropical cyclone formation."

Late on August 4, the FMS issued its final advisory on the system as it reported that the system was not expected to develop.[citation needed] During October 12, Tropical Disturbance 02F developed along the South Pacific convergence zone, while it was located about 450\u00a0km (280\u00a0mi) to the northwest of Rotuma.[246][247] The system was located within a favourable environment for further development, with low to moderate vertical wind shear, and it lay under an upper-level ridge of high pressure.[246][248] Despite all of this, the system dissipated on October 18.[citation needed] On November 23, Tropical Disturbance 03F developed within a trough of low pressure, about 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) to the northeast of Suva, Fiji.[249] The system lay in an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear, to the south of an upper-level ridge of high pressure.[249] Across American Samoa, Tuni produced strong winds and heavy rains. Sustained winds of 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) were observed in Tututila at an elevated location. Some trees were uprooted. Plantations, shacks, and garages sustained damage with total losses amounting to US$5\u00a0million.[250] There was no significant damage recorded in Niue, as the system brushed the island nation.[251] Tropical Disturbance 04F was first noted on December 1, while it was located about 640\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) to the northeast of Papeete in French Polynesia.[252] Over the next day the poorly organised system moved westwards, underneath an upper-level ridge of high pressure before it dissipated during December 2.[253][254] During December 27, Tropical Disturbance 06F developed to the north of Wallis Island, in an area of moderate to high vertical wind shear.[255] In late December 2015, a long-lived and powerful westerly wind burst triggered the formation of a tropical disturbance in the south Pacific, along with its twin in the central North Pacific, which became Tropical Depression Nine-C.[256] During December 26, Tropical Disturbance 05F developed within a monsoon trough, about 465\u00a0km (290\u00a0mi) to the south-east of the Honiara in the Solomon Islands. The system lay under an upper level ridge of high pressure in an area of moderate to high vertical wind shear. Over the next few days the system moved eastwards and gradually developed further, becoming a tropical depression during December 29, while it was located to the north of the Samoan Islands.[citation needed]"

This forecast was of extreme wind and waves on the eastern coast of Scotland at Aberdeenshire, all the way down to the Tees Estuary in England.[10] Red warnings for wind were issued for north-eastern parts of the UK, as well as extensive orange and yellow warnings for much of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and most of England. Dangerous waves were also forecast to cause disruption to ferry services.[11] The damage caused by the storm was compounded by the fact that \"sustained winds with gusts in excess of 90 mph were, unusually, from the north-east, affecting trees that do not normally have to yield to those winds.\"[12][13] 112,000 homes were without power in the north of England (mostly in Northumberland, County Durham and Tyne & Wear), 80,000 were without power in Scotland (Aberdeenshire, Angus, Perthshire and the Moray Coast), and 13,000 homes in Wales lost power too.[14] On 30 November, 45,000 UK consumers were still without power, according to the Energy Networks Association (ENA),[15] and network operators were required to pay \u00a344 million in compensation.[16] Many people went without power for a week, relying on local establishments for food and other amenities. Northern Powergrid stated Arwen was the largest storm to impact their network since 2005,[17] with large sections of overhead lines needing to be rebuilt.[18] Many thousands of homes were still without power a week after the storm,[19] and it was not until 7 December that power was fully restored.[20] It was estimated that around eight million trees in Scotland were damaged or affected by the storm. It is predicted that many forests will take decades to return to their former size. [21] Dozens of crashes were reported by police agencies across the UK, many roads were closed due to fallen trees, snow or ice. More than 120 lorries were stuck in heavy snow on the M62 in Greater Manchester, with the motorway shut by police while ploughs and gritters led the rescue effort.[22] At 5pm GMT on 26 November, Network Rail closed the rail lines north of Berwick-upon-Tweed and LNER stopped running trains north of Newcastle.[23] A man in the Northern Irish town of Antrim died when a falling tree hit his car.[24] Another man was hit and killed by a falling tree in Cumbria,[25] and a third man died after his pick-up truck was struck by a falling tree in Aberdeenshire.[26] The live broadcasts and filming of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! on 26, 27, 28 and 29 November at Gwrych Castle in North Wales were affected as a result of the storm.[27] Wind speeds reached up to 100 miles per hour (160\u00a0km/h) which caused waves in Scotland of over 10 metres (33\u00a0ft) in height. Beamish Museum in County Durham was closed due to debris.[28]"

There were nine tropical storms, of which five became hurricanes. Two of those strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[1] The first system was initially observed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a026. The tenth and final system dissipated near Bermuda on November\u00a010. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. In post-season analysis, two tropical cyclones that existed in October were added to HURDAT \u2013 the official Atlantic hurricane database. At one point during the season, September\u00a03 through the following day, a set of three tropical cyclones existed simultaneously. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Three, nicknamed the San Ciriaco hurricane. A post-season analysis of this storm indicated that it was the longest-lasting Atlantic tropical cyclone on record. The path impacted the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and the Azores. The San Ciriaco hurricane alone caused about $20\u00a0million (1899\u00a0USD) in damage and at least 3,855\u00a0deaths.[nb 1] Another notable tropical cyclone, the Carrabelle hurricane, brought extensive damage to Dominican Republic and Florida Panhandle. Losses in Florida reached about $1\u00a0million. At least nine deaths were associated with the storm. Hurricane Nine in October brought flooding to Cuba and Jamaica, as well as minor damage to South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia."

At 0900\u00a0UTC on June\u00a027, the system made landfall near the southwestern end of Galveston Island, Texas at the same intensity. Three hours later, it weakened to a tropical depression and later dissipated over Southeast Texas at 1800\u00a0UTC.[3] Heavy rainfall produced by the storm from Granbury to Waco and toward the coast contributed to an ongoing flood event in the state.[4] According to Texas State Senator Asbury Bascom Davidson, the Brazos, Colorado, Guadalupe rivers overflowed,[2] while other reports note that the Navasota and San Saba rivers also exceeded their banks. Consequently, an estimated 12,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (31,000\u00a0km2) of land was inundated. In Hearne, water rose above every rain gauge. Thousands of people were left homeless.

Shortly thereafter, it made landfall in Azua Province with an intensity equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Early on July\u00a029, the system weakened to a tropical storm, shortly before emerging into the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. It then moved west-northwestward and remained at relatively the same intensity over the next 24\u00a0hours. The storm made landfall near Islamorada, Florida, on July\u00a030. Crossing the Florida Keys, it soon emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm began to re-intensify on July\u00a031 and became a hurricane later that day. Early on August\u00a01, it peaked with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), several hours before making landfall near Apalachicola, Florida, at the same intensity. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated over southern Alabama on August\u00a02.[3] In Dominican Republic, three large schooners were wrecked at Santo Domingo; only one crew member on the three vessels survived. \"Great\" damage was reported along coastal sections of the country, while a loss of telegraph service impacted most of interior areas. In Florida, damage in the city of Carrabelle was extensive, with no more than a score of \"unimportant\" houses remained. Losses in the city reached approximately $100,000. At least 57\u00a0shipping vessels were destroyed; damage from these ships collectively totaled about $375,000. Additionally, 13\u00a0lumber vessels were beached. Many boats at the harbor and the wharfs in Lanark were wrecked. Large portions of stores and pavilions in the city were damaged. The towns of Curtis Mill and McIntyre were completely destroyed, while the resort city of St. Teresa suffered significant damage. Seven deaths were confirmed in Florida.[2] Overall, losses reached at least $1\u00a0million.[6]"

It slowly strengthened while heading steadily west-northwestward across the Atlantic Ocean. By late on August\u00a05, the storm strengthened into a hurricane. During the following 48\u00a0hours, it deepened further, reaching Category\u00a04 hurricane status before crossing the Leeward Islands on August\u00a07. Later that day, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg). The storm weakened slightly before making landfall in Guayama, Puerto Rico, with sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a08. Several hours later, it emerged into the southwestern Atlantic as a Category\u00a03 hurricane; it would remain at that intensity for over nine days. The system paralleled the north coast of Dominican Republic and then crossed the Bahamas, striking several islands, including Andros and Grand Bahama. After clearing the Bahamas, it began heading northward on August\u00a014, while centered east of Florida. Early on the following day, the storm re-curved northeastward and appeared to be heading out to sea. However, by August\u00a017, it turned back to the northwest. At 0100\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018, the storm made landfall near Hatteras, North Carolina, with 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) winds.[3] The storm weakened after moving inland and fell to Category\u00a01 intensity by 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018. Later that day, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. Now heading northeastward, it continued weakening, but maintained Category\u00a01 intensity. By late on August\u00a020, the storm curved eastward over the northwestern Atlantic. It also began losing tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022, while located about 325\u00a0mi (525\u00a0km) south of Sable Island. However, after four days, the system regenerated into a tropical storm while located about 695\u00a0mi (1,120\u00a0km) west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on August\u00a026. It moved slowly north-northwestward, until curving to the east on August\u00a029. Between August\u00a026 and September\u00a01, the storm did not differentiate in intensity, but began re-strengthening while turning southeastward on September\u00a02. Early on the following day, the storm again reached hurricane intensity. It curved northeastward and passed through the Azores on September\u00a03, shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.[3] The storm had the longest duration of an Atlantic hurricane on record, lasting for 31\u00a0days, about 28 of which it was tropical.[3][7] In Guadeloupe, the storm unroofed and flooded many houses. Communications were significantly disrupted in the interior portions of the island. Impact was severe in Montserrat, with nearly every building destroyed and 100\u00a0deaths reported. About 200\u00a0small houses were destroyed on Saint Kitts, with estates suffering considerable damage, while nearly all estates were destroyed on Saint Croix. Eleven deaths were reported on the island.[2] In Puerto Rico, the system brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused extensive flooding. Approximately 250,000\u00a0people were left without food and shelter. Additionally, telephone, telegraph, and electrical services were completely lost. Overall, damage totaled approximately $20\u00a0million, with over half were losses inflicted on crops, particularly coffee. At the time, it was the costliest and worst tropical cyclone in Puerto Rico. It was officially estimated that the storm caused 3,369\u00a0fatalities in Puerto Rico.[8] In the Bahamas, strong winds and waves sank 50\u00a0small crafts, most of them at Andros. Severe damage was reported in the capital city of Nassau, with over 100\u00a0buildings destroyed and many damaged, including the Government House. A few houses were also destroyed in Bimini. The death toll in the Bahamas was at least 125.[2] In North Carolina, storm surge and rough sea destroyed fishing piers and bridges, as well as sink about 10\u00a0vessels. Because Hatteras Island was almost entirely inundated with 4 to 10 feet (1.2 to 3.0\u00a0m) of water, a great proportion of homes on the island were damaged, with much destruction at Diamond City. There were at least 20\u00a0deaths in the state of North Carolina.[9] In the Azores, the storm also caused one fatality and significant damage on some islands.[10]"

The season's first system developed on March\u00a06, and the last storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a023. 1908 remains the only Atlantic hurricane season on record to feature two hurricanes prior to the month of June. The season's most intense tropical cyclone peaked as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) in mid-September. Significant damage and at least 26\u00a0deaths occurred in Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas as a result of this storm. Most of the other systems also impacted land. In May, the second storm caused thousands of dollars in damage and one indirect death in the Northeastern United States. The next system caused flooding in North Carolina, resulting in the deaths of two children. In late September and early October, the eighth system caused considerable damage in portions of the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas, leaving six people dead. A hurricane which struck the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua inflicted severe damage in several communities and killed at least two people. Overall, the tropical cyclones of the season collectively caused at least 37\u00a0fatalities."

        "content": "Tropical cyclogenesis began on March\u00a06, 1908, when the first system was initially detected northeast of the Lesser Antilles.[1] It was the only off-season Atlantic tropical cyclone to reach Category\u00a02 strength since the beginning of official records in 1851.[2] On May\u00a024, the next system developed near the Turks and Caicos Islands. When it intensified into a hurricane on May\u00a028,[1] the 1908 season became the only on record in which two systems reached hurricane status prior to the month of June.[3] Thereafter, activity ceased for nearly two months, until the third cyclone formed northeast of the Bahamas on July\u00a024, followed by another system forming in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico on July\u00a029.[1] The month of August featured two cyclones, a tropical depression and a tropical storm.[4] September was the most active month, with five systems developing, including two hurricanes, one tropical storm,[1] and two tropical depressions.[4] In October, a hurricane and a tropical storm developed, the latter of which became extratropical on October\u00a023, ending seasonal activity.[1] The season had a total of 10\u00a0tropical storms, 6 of which intensified into a hurricane.[1] Re-analysis by Jos\u00e9 F. Partag\u00e1s and Henry F. Diaz in 1997 resulted in the addition of the second system,[5] while Christopher Landsea et al. added the sixth system in 2004 as part of the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project.[4] Seven out of the ten systems reaching at least tropical storm intensity made landfall during the season.[1] Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the 1908 Atlantic hurricane season caused at least 37\u00a0fatalities.[6] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 95. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[7]"

Communications were also disrupted.[5] The captain of the Dutch steamer Prins Willem V. reported considerable damage in Haiti.[27] In Cuba, the hurricane destroyed several buildings, including the custom house, which was under construction. Many fruit groves suffered substantial damage.[28] The storm produced hurricane-force winds and heavy precipitation over the western Bahamas.[5] At Nassau, sustained winds reached 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Much of New Providence was inundated due to rainfall amounts up to 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm). Property damage was generally light, however, with only smaller dwellings and outbuildings being demolished. Several large vessels capsized in the vicinity of the island,[29] resulting in six deaths.[30] On the Abaco Islands, several buildings at a timber company's plant, one home, and several huts were destroyed. Eleuthera also reported extensive damage, including the destruction of a mission house, a chapel, and several other buildings. The storm toppled many coconut trees, while one plantation alone lost about 300\u00a0banana trees.[31] Throughout the Bahamas, this storm, combined with the hurricane in mid-September, resulted in the near total loss of grapefruit, orange, and sisal crops.

        "content": " Hurricane Pali was the earliest-forming Pacific hurricane on record, being the first Pacific hurricane to occur in January since Hurricane Ekeka of 1992. The first tropical cyclone of the 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Pali originated as an area of low pressure within a persistent trough, near the equator on January 6, 2016. Deep convection gradually built up around the center of the disturbance as the system curved northward, before it organized into a tropical depression on the next day, making the system the earliest recorded tropical cyclone in the Pacific hurricane basin. The system quickly intensified into a tropical storm, resulting in it being named Pali. During the next few days, Pali slowly moved northward while slowly curving towards the west, strengthening somewhat before weakening due to the presence of wind shear. On January\u00a010, Pali slowly turned eastward and proceeded to re-strengthen as wind shear diminished. On January\u00a012, Pali strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale (SSWHS) while curving towards the south. The next day, Pali reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h)[nb 1] and a minimum central pressure of 978\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.88\u00a0inHg). Afterward, Pali quickly began to weaken, as the storm encountered stronger wind shear, with the storm weakening into a Category\u00a01 hurricane several hours later, before weakening into a tropical storm later that day. On January\u00a014, Pali weakened into a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low the next day, since conditions became increasingly hostile. Later that day, Pali's remnants dissipated near the same location where they had formed roughly a week ago. Pali formed and tracked near the equator, forming at a latitude of 3.3\u00b0N and tracking as low as 2.6\u00b0N as a tropical depression. This made Pali the second-lowest latitude tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere at the time, which was extremely unusual, given the unfavorable conditions that are usually in place around the equator. Pali had severe impacts in Kiribati, grounding a cargo ship and killing four people, in addition to causing major coastal flooding, although the total amount of damage was not specified in the island nation's report to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).[2][3][4]"

Occasionally, systems develop outside these seasons,[5] most frequently in May or December, though some off-season storms also develop in January.[6] Activity in January is extremely rare; only two systems other than Pali have been recorded since 1949: Tropical Storm Winona in 1989 and Hurricane Ekeka in 1992, which became a Category 3 major hurricane.[7][6] Pali was the earliest tropical cyclone recorded in the Central Pacific basin, forming on January 7, beating Tropical Storm Winona by six days.[8] Pali was also the earliest recorded Central Pacific hurricane, reaching hurricane intensity on January 12, beating the previous record-holder, Hurricane Ekeka, by 19 days.[9] Pali also formed and tracked closer to the equator than any other storm recorded in the Pacific hurricane basin.[9][10] Pali became a tropical depression near 3.3\u00b0N.[1] During its final days as a tropical cyclone, Pali reached a minimum latitude of 2.6\u00b0N as a tropical depression, making it the second-lowest latitude tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere, just behind Tropical Depression Nine-C, which attained a minimum latitude of 2.2\u00b0N just two weeks prior;[1][11][12] no other tropical cyclone in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s records in the Central Pacific had ever ventured that close to the equator, dating back to 1842.[9] Tropical cyclones usually do not develop that close to the equator, due to the strength of the Coriolis force at those latitudes, which is too weak to induce the spin necessary to form tropical cyclones.[9][7] Prior to the storm's dissipation, when Pali curved back towards the south, some meteorologists speculated that Pali could cross over the equator into the Southern Hemisphere, given the steering currents in place, which would have been an extremely rare occurrence had the storm done so.[9][13] Unrelated to Pali, the formation of Hurricane Alex over the North Atlantic in mid-January coincided with Pali's development over the Central Pacific. This marked the first occurrence of simultaneous January tropical cyclones between these two basins.[14]"

        "content": "In late December 2015, a long-lived and powerful westerly wind burst\u2014a feature commonly associated with strong El Ni\u00f1o events\u2014triggered the formation of Tropical Depression Nine-C in the central North Pacific, along with its twin, Tropical Cyclone Ula, in the central South Pacific. Tropical Depression Nine-C quickly dissipated by the start of 2016, leaving behind a large area of moisture across the equatorial Pacific.[1][11][12] The persistent, powerful westerly wind burst spurred cyclogenesis within a persistent, low-latitude, west-to-east-oriented surface trough that spanned between 1.0\u00b0N and 3.0\u00b0N latitude as far east as 155.0\u00b0W longitude, resulting in the formation of a weak area of low pressure on January\u00a06, at the extremely low latitude of 1.9\u00b0N.[1] The disturbance developed in an area of high wind shear, which kept the system from quickly organizing. The low and the trough drifted northward, as the subtropical ridge spanning the region was significantly weakened by a passing extratropical storm in the North Pacific. Deep convection then developed near the low and also along a broad portion of the trough; however, thunderstorms failed to concentrate around the center of the disturbance. Fueled by unusually high sea surface temperatures, estimated at 29.5\u00a0\u00b0C (85.1\u00a0\u00b0F), deep convection increased and gradually organized around the low, and the system gradually coalesced into a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC on January\u00a07, at a latitude of 3.3\u00b0N. This marked the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone on record in the Central Pacific, surpassing 1989's Tropical Storm Winona by six days.[8] A ridge aloft centered directly above the system enhanced its poleward anticyclonic outflow, enabling the development of deep convection around its center, and soon afterward, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, which received the name Pali, becoming the earliest tropical cyclone recorded in the northeastern Pacific.[1][15] Pali continued intensifying through the first half of January\u00a08 and nearly reached Category\u00a01 hurricane strength, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds reaching 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), but easterly vertical wind shear caused by the ridge aloft increased and disrupted its center, causing the storm to start weakening and curve northwestward.[1] Steady weakening continued through January\u00a09, as Pali's deep convection was displaced to the west of its low-level circulation center and intermittently pulsed, later leading to a sharp decrease in the storm's intensity.[1] By the end of that day, Pali barely maintained tropical storm strength, with the storm's 1-minute sustained winds registering at 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). The lack of persistent deep convection resulted in Pali being a weaker system, but this permitted the storm to be more resistant to the easterly wind shear, causing its forward motion to decrease significantly.[1] The ridge of high pressure weakened and retreated southward on January\u00a010, which caused the vertical wind shear to gradually diminish. Afterward, Pali started re-intensifying, with persistent deep convection redeveloping near its center and within the storm's western quadrant. This shift in steering currents also caused Pali to slowly turn eastward. Pali almost completely stalled during this time, due to the absence of significant steering currents.[1] On January\u00a011, the ridge of high pressure moved directly over Pali, leading to the reestablishment of poleward outflow above the storm and the eventual development of southwesterly flow aloft, enabling the storm's convection to slowly increase in coverage and organization within all quadrants, and also establishing a northeastward movement.[1] At 00:00 UTC on January\u00a012, light vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperatures enabled Pali to strengthen into a Category\u00a01 hurricane, becoming the earliest hurricane on record in the northeast Pacific basin, beating the previous record set by Hurricane Ekeka in 1992, by 19 days. Around the same time, the storm began curving towards the southeast, as a deep ridge developed to the north. The storm also displayed a well-defined eye by 18:00 UTC that day.[1] Pali continued strengthening while travelling southward, and early on January\u00a013, Pali reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 978 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg).[1][16] During the next few days, Pali rapidly weakened while turning back towards the south-southwest, due to steady increases in southerly vertical wind shear and the loss of Coriolis force. The storm's weakening trend began on January 13 and accelerated through the next day, as Pali moved back towards the area from where it had formed. The storm's eye became indistinguishable by 06:00 UTC on January 13, as the system continued to weaken.[1] Vertical wind shear exceeded 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) by early January 14. Further decay in the organization of the storm's deep convection caused Pali to be downgraded into a remnant low late on January\u00a014, with the system barely being distinguishable within the surface trough where it had spent its entire life,[1][17] and the storm's center dissipated by 00:00 UTC on January\u00a015. However, Pali's remnants continued to persist for a while, before dissipating later that day.[18][19] Pali completed a broad and looping track, dissipating approximately 50\u00a0nmi (58\u00a0mi; 93\u00a0km) from where it had initially developed.[1] While weakening, Pali reached a minimum latitude of 2.6\u00b0N, making it the second-lowest latitude tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere, behind Tropical Depression Nine-C, which attained a minimum latitude of 2.2\u00b0N just two weeks prior.[1][11][12]"

        "content": "Hurricane Carmen was the most intense tropical cyclone of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season. A destructive storm with widespread impacts, Carmen developed from a tropical wave that emerged from Africa toward the end of August. The disturbance traveled westward, and organized as a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on August\u00a029. The storm moved through the Caribbean Sea, and in an environment conducive to intensification, it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. Carmen moved ashore on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, where, despite striking a sparsely populated region, it caused significant crop damage and killed several people. Before the storm's arrival, officials had set up several evacuation centers, and many residents had moved to higher ground. Upon entering  the Gulf of Mexico, Carmen turned northward and re-intensified as it approached the United States. Initially threatening the major city of New Orleans, it veered westward and made landfall on the marshland of southern Louisiana, eventually dissipating over eastern Texas on September\u00a010. Tropical cyclone watches and warnings had been issued for the storm, and approximately 100,000 residents left their homes and sought shelter. Damage was lighter than first feared, but the sugar industry suffered substantial losses. Throughout its course, the hurricane killed 8 people and caused $162\u00a0million in damage. Due to the severity of the storm, the name Carmen was retired from the list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Carmen can be traced to a weather disturbance over Africa during the middle of August\u00a01974. The disturbance moved slowly westward with little convective activity initially, although upon entering the Atlantic Ocean, it spawned a tropical wave within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The wave had intensified and broadened by August\u00a025, and it eventually split into two components, the northernmost of which consolidated into an organized storm system.[1] Moving westward, the system developed into a tropical depression on August\u00a029, more than 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) east of Guadeloupe.[2]  Due to favorable outflow from an anticyclone nearby, the depression gradually strengthened as it moved through the Lesser Antilles.[3] It attained tropical storm status on August 30, south of Puerto Rico,[2] and was named Carmen by the National Hurricane Center.[4] At first, the storm's proximity to Hispaniola prevented further strengthening,[5] but by August\u00a031, it had managed to intensify into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[2] As Carmen passed south of Jamaica, an eye feature briefly appeared.[6] On September\u00a01, the hurricane began to rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Caribbean Sea; by 18:00\u00a0Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), it had strengthened to Category\u00a04 intensity.[2] Continuing westward, the storm passed north of Swan Island later that day.[3] Early on September\u00a02, a double eyewall appeared on satellite imagery.[7] Carmen's forward movement gradually slowed as the storm took a west by north direction,[8] and it reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), accompanied by a central barometric pressure of 928\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.4\u00a0inHg).[2] Atmospheric steering currents became increasingly weaker, and Carmen slowed to a drift.[9] Later on September\u00a02, the hurricane made landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula; its northern jog spared Belize City from a direct hit. The storm's center passed a few miles north of Chetumal, Quintana Roo.[2] The cyclone drifted inland, deteriorating to a tropical storm on September\u00a03.[2] About a day later, Carmen emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, where it nearly stalled. Turning northward, the storm regained hurricane strength on September\u00a05.[2] Carmen continued to strengthen and accelerated northward towards the United States Gulf Coast,[3] reaching a forward speed of 12\u00a0mph (19\u00a0km/h); at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, it once again became a Category\u00a03 major hurricane.[2] The storm then became a Category\u00a04 hurricane again and reached its second peak intensity while located south of Louisiana; although the wind speeds were identical to that of its initial peak, the barometric pressure was slightly higher. Carmen weakened and veered westward before landfall, ultimately striking south-central Louisiana. After moving ashore, the hurricane quickly lost strength and late on September\u00a09 degenerated into a tropical depression. The depression moved westward and soon dissipated over eastern Texas.[2]"

Mexican officials declared an emergency alert by September\u00a02, although they did not advise any evacuations. Meteorologists in the United States urged those living near the coast to move inland immediately.[10] Fearing significant loss of life and property, the Red Cross began preparations for the approaching hurricane in Belize.[10] The following day, the Mexican Army rushed to set up emergency operation centers and shelters in five cities. Mobile communication units and relief teams were prepared for deployment following the storm's passage.[11] Many of the nearly 35,000\u00a0residents in and around the city of Chetumal evacuated to higher ground.[12] Although it initially threatened the United States city of New Orleans, the hurricane turned west prior to making landfall and spared the area from severe damage.[3] Contrary to its actual path, forecasters predicted the hurricane to execute an eastward swerve toward Florida. Had the cyclone instead continued northward and traveled over Lake Pontchartrain, low-lying areas could have suffered \"catastrophic\" flooding.[13] Over 100,000\u00a0residents of the Gulf Coast, mostly in Louisiana and Mississippi, evacuated in advance of the hurricane,[14] causing heavy congestion on highways.[13] About 60,000\u00a0people sought shelter in facilities across the New Orleans region, according to Red Cross officials.[15] Hurricane warnings were issued along the coast, while Coast Guard personnel went door-to-door on Grand Isle urging residents to leave the area. From there through the coast of southwestern Florida, small craft were advised to remain near shore due to rough seas.[16] Offshore, workers were removed from oil rigs.[17] Many Mississippi citizens, having experienced the destruction of Hurricane Camille just five years earlier, quickly left their coastal homes.[18]"

Also, there were five storm-related deaths in Louisiana. Freshwater and tidal flooding occurred there, and, to a lesser degree, in the other Gulf Coast states. On account of the hurricane's landfall intensities and the widespread damage it caused, the name Carmen was later retired from the rotating lists of Atlantic hurricane names.

Communication with the hardest hit regions was lost following Carmen's passage; however, early reports stated that at least five people were injured.[11] Several days later, officials in Mexico confirmed that three people had been killed by the storm. The city of Chetumal was described as a \"disaster\", and hundreds of people were left homeless.[26] More than 5,000\u00a0people in the city lost their belongings as a result of the storm. Officials in the area estimated that damage in Chetumal alone reached $8\u00a0million (1974\u00a0USD).[27] Throughout the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Hurricane Carmen claimed four lives and wrought $10\u00a0million (1974\u00a0USD) in damage.[28] Following Carmen's passage, officials feared the worst for an area of 1,000\u00a0mi2 (2,590\u00a0km2) where communication was lost in Belize. A reconnaissance task force was sent out from Belize City the day after Carmen made landfall to assist any residents stranded by the storm.[29] One person was killed off the coast of Belize after being washed off his boat by large swells produced by Carmen. Three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents. Thousands of people moved from coastal areas inland to escape the storm.

Precipitation peaked at over 13\u00a0in (330\u00a0mm) in Atmore, Alabama.[19] Winds gusted up to 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h), and along the coast, tides ran as high as 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) above normal.[3] Over northwestern Louisiana, winds ranged from 40 to 45\u00a0mph (64 to 72\u00a0km/h) and brought down several trees.[31] In New Orleans, despite wind gusts to 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h), minimal damage was reported.[32] The hurricane's effects in Baton Rouge were confined to strewn debris and a few downed trees.[33] Because Carmen moved ashore over uninhabited marshland, it caused far less damage than initially feared.[34] Nonetheless, tidal flooding from the Gulf of Mexico and coastal bodies of water was severe. Freshwater flooding was less extreme. In total, the storm inundated 2,380,500 acres (963,400\u00a0ha) of land in Louisiana, including 742,300 acres (300,400\u00a0ha) in Terrebonne Parish and 590,000 acres (240,000\u00a0ha) in Plaquemines Parish.[35][36] A large oak tree was overturned by high winds in the town of Jeanerette in Iberia Parish. The storm's greatest impact was the loss of sugar cane crops in Louisiana. An estimated 308,000 acres (125,000\u00a0ha) of sugar cane in 16\u00a0parishes was damaged, and about 20\u00a0percent was completely ruined.[37] After a tour of the affected area, then-Governor Edwin Edwards estimated crop damage alone at $400\u00a0million,[38] although a more recent estimate placed total agricultural damage from the hurricane at $74\u00a0million.[35] The sugar cane crop was crucial to the country's sugar supplies, rendering the losses \"doubly bad\",[38] and sugar futures rose drastically after the storm.[39] Other crops damaged by Carmen included soybeans, rice, and cotton.[35] Tidal action along the coast affected the balance of salinity in coastal marshes and water bodies. The sudden intrusion of saltwater stressed delicate plants. Fish, shrimp and oysters also suffered the ecological effects of Hurricane Carmen. Flooding on land caused some wildlife to drown. Several parks in Louisiana sustained damage, either from flooding or high winds; losses to Grand Island State Park in particular totaled $114,600. The oil and gas industry was also affected, and its estimated $24.7\u00a0million in losses resulted mainly from damage to equipment and offshore facilities. The storm diminished oil production by 1.4 million barrels when it shut down operations for 24 to 48 hours at various locations.[35] Over 60,000 electric cooperative customers lost power.[40] The hurricane caused two fatalities in Louisiana: a utility repairman who was electrocuted while working on power lines damaged by strong winds,[38] and a motorist who was involved in a storm-related traffic accident.[41] Total monetary losses in the state was estimated at $150 million.[3] Overall, the hurricane spawned four confirmed tornadoes.[42] One touched down near Brandon, Mississippi, destroying a barn and causing other damage.[43] Another struck Kaplan, Louisiana, injuring one person.[44] The storm's effects in Mississippi were described as minimal and were mainly confined to minor traffic accidents during bouts of heavy precipitation.[45] Light to moderate rainfall from the storm extended as far east as Florida and Georgia and as far west as Oklahoma and Texas.[19]"

        "content": " Hurricane Leslie (known as\u00a0Storm Leslie[1] or Cyclone Leslie[2] while extratropical) was the strongest cyclone of tropical origin to strike the Iberian Peninsula since 1842. A large, long-lived, and very erratic tropical cyclone, Leslie was the twelfth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season.[3] The storm had a non-tropical origin, developing from an extratropical cyclone that was situated over the northern Atlantic on 22 September. The low quickly acquired subtropical characteristics and was classified as Subtropical Storm Leslie on the following day. The cyclone meandered over the northern Atlantic and gradually weakened, before merging with a frontal system on 25 September, which later intensified into a powerful hurricane-force extratropical low over the northern Atlantic. While Leslie began to weaken late on 27 September, the low began to re-acquire subtropical characteristics, and by 28 September, Leslie had completed the transition to a subtropical storm once again. Leslie became fully tropical and gradually intensified, becoming a Category\u00a01 hurricane early on 3 October, and initially peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) later that day. Leslie gradually weakened, falling to tropical storm intensity late on 4 October. The cyclone continued to slowly weaken before beginning to re-intensify on 8 October. Two days later, Leslie reached hurricane status for the second time. Leslie continued to slowly strengthen, reaching peak intensity with sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.59\u00a0inHg), early on 12 October. Leslie then began to gradually weaken later that day, while accelerating towards the northeast and passed far south of the Azores. On 13 October, Leslie passed north of Madeira, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone just off the Portuguese coast later that day. Leslie's remnants made landfall in central Portugal a few hours later. The low continued moving northeastward while rapidly weakening, passing over the Bay of Biscay, before dissipating by 16 October over Spain. The storm was responsible for 17 deaths in mainland Europe, including 2 direct deaths in Portugal and 15 indirect deaths in France. In November 2018, Aon estimated that Leslie's damage total exceeded \u20ac424\u00a0million (US$500\u00a0million).[nb 1] Hurricane Leslie prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings for Madeira Island. Leslie brought wind gusts up to 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) to Portugal, felling thousands of trees, causing the collapse of hundreds of structures, and damaging hundreds of buildings, signs, and pieces of equipment. Over 300,000 citizens were left without power. Damage across the country was estimated to be \u20ac120\u00a0million (US$145\u00a0million). City, municipal, and the national government provided funds to repair damage to buildings as well as the local forests, and also launch cleanup efforts. Leslie brought strong winds and torrential rainfall to Spain, most notably the Catalonia region, causing a river to spill its banks, nearly four dozen landslides to occur, and damaging several structures and vehicles. The storm disrupted transportation and caused 14,000 power outages throughout the country. Leslie and a cold front, the latter of which was almost stationary, combined to cause record-breaking flooding in the Aude, France. The flooding in the department was considered to be the worst since 1891. Floodwaters damaged buildings, roads, and vehicles throughout several towns and cities, causing \u20ac220\u00a0million (US$254\u00a0million) in damage. Nearly 1,000 people were evacuated when a dam overflowed in Pezens Municipality, and over 8,000 people lost power nationwide."

        "content": "The United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) began forecasting on 19 September 2018 that an extratropical low would form in a few days between the Azores and Bermuda.[4] This system developed along the boundary of a front early on 22 September, approximately 1,295\u00a0km (805\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Flores Island.[5] This system was associated with the southern portion of the remnants of Hurricane Florence, which had previously split into two storms on 18 September.[6][7] Amid favorable environmental conditions,[8] the system separated from the front, and its banding features became better established, signaling the formation of Subtropical Storm Leslie by 12:00 UTC on 23 September.[5] Around that time, Leslie was within an upper-level low and the former's gale-force winds were displaced from the center.[9] The subtropical cyclone was located within an area of minimal steering currents, causing the storm's movement to be erratic.[5][10] Moderate vertical wind shear and dry air hindered the development of thunderstorm activity or convection outside the southeastern portion of the system, as it tracked generally southwestward.[11] The cyclone turned towards the south and later the east on 24 September.[12][13] During that time, Leslie's cloud pattern became irregular, with several cloud swirls existing within a broadening circulation.[14] Leslie weakened into a subtropical depression around 00:00 UTC on 25 September, due to the continuing wind shear and dry air.[5] The storm began a southeastward motion later in the day,[15] followed by a turn back to the east. Leslie became an extratropical cyclone around 12:00 UTC, after its circulation expanded along a baroclinic zone. At that time, an expansive stratocumulus cloud shield was becoming established and cold, stable air was entering the region.[16] During the next couple of days, Leslie's track consisted of an incomplete counterclockwise loop. At the same time, the baroclinic processes strengthened the extratropical cyclone, leading to hurricane-force winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) by 00:00 UTC on 27 September. A weakening trend commenced during the middle of the day and persisted until 28 September. However, as Leslie tracked westward, it began to reacquire tropical characteristics and was declared a subtropical storm once more around 12:00 UTC.[5] The storm had reestablished bands of convection near its center and its wind field had shrunk considerably. While Leslie had transitioned from a cold core to a warm core system, it was still located within a sizable low-pressure system.[17] Over the next couple of days, the cyclone experienced minimal change in strength as it tracked in a southwesterly direction around the western edge of an extensive cyclonic circulation.[5] Thunderstorm activity developed near Leslie's center and anticyclonic outflow materialized to the northeast and southeast of the system. As a result, Leslie became a tropical storm by 18:00 UTC on 29 September, while it was located approximately 1,850\u00a0km (1,150\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores.[5][18]"

        "content": "Located within a region of cool sea surface temperatures and strong northwesterly wind shear,[18][19] the tropical storm intensified little during the next couple of days.[5] Banding features began to increase on 1 October, as the wind shear subsided.[20] Leslie continued a west-southwestward to southwestward motion over the next day or so, while located in weak steering currents and positioned between high-pressure systems that were located to the west and northeast.[5] As Leslie began to strengthen more quickly on 2 October, convection increased both in intensity and organization. Microwave imagery displayed that Leslie had developed an eye at its low levels.[21] The storm intensified into a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on 3 October.[5] Meanwhile, Leslie became stationary, with its southerly movement ending.[22] Leslie reached its initial peak at 18:00 UTC as a Category 1 hurricane, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[5] At the time, the storm had a large, irregular eye, with sporadic dry air entrainment. The storm began to track northward between a shortwave trough, which was located to the northeast, and a mid-level ridge, which was located to Leslie's southeast.[23] Moving over cooler, 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures, Leslie began to weaken slowly on 4 October.[5][24] The cyclone weakened to a tropical storm around 18:00 UTC.[5] By 5 October, Leslie's inner core had dissipated, and the storm possessed only small bands of convection on the outer limits of its circulation.[25] Convection refired over the storm's center later that day, although the maximum winds were located 165\u2013185\u00a0km (103\u2013115\u00a0mi) away.[26] Leslie turned towards the east from late 5 October to 6 October, under the influence of mid-latitude westerly flow.[27][28] Although the tropical storm traversed a region of even colder, 24\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u201377\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures during the next couple of days and was located in a region of moderate wind shear,[5][29] the storm changed little in strength.[5] Leslie's convection became more organized on 6 October, as banding features became more defined and a mid-level eye formed to the southeast of the storm's low-level circulation center.[30] Leslie turned towards the east-southeast on 7 October, still under the influence of the westerly flow.[31] Leslie bottomed out as an 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) tropical storm at 00:00 UTC, as it passed over an area of cool sea surface temperatures.[5][32]"

        "content": "Leslie began to restrengthen later on 8 October, as an inner core began to develop and convection became more intense.[5][33] While the storm continued to track in a southeastward direction, traversing an environment of warmer sea surface temperatures and lower wind shear, a mid-level eye feature began to develop.[34] Turning towards the south, Leslie restrengthened into a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on 10 October.[5] Around that time, the storm's strongest convection was concentrated towards the north, and an irregular eye had emerged on satellite imagery.[35] The cyclone began to proceed east-northeastward early on 11 October, as strengthening continued.[5][36] Leslie peaked at 00:00 UTC on 12 October as a Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg), while located approximately 1,065\u00a0km (662\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Flores Island.[5] The storm had a small, cloud-filled eye around that time.[37] Leslie began to slowly weaken once more later that day, as sea surface temperatures decreased to 23\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F) and wind shear increased.[5][38] The mid-latitude westerly flow began to rapidly accelerate Leslie towards the east-northeast, with the cyclone passing 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Madeira Island around 06:00 UTC on 13 October.[5] Shortly after, Leslie began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, as colder air entered from the south and west and the system's mid-level eye decayed.[39] The cyclone's convection continued to disintegrate as a result of even colder 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures and strong wind shear.[40][41] The NHC issued its final advisory on Leslie around 21:00 UTC on 13 October, after the storm became fully extratropical.[5][41] The cyclone moved ashore near Figueira da Foz at 21:00 UTC, with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Leslie weakened as it traversed the Bay of Biscay on 14 October,[5] reaching western France by 15 October.[42][43]\nAn almost stationary, convective cold front over southern France was assisted by Leslie. The latter helped to spawn a surface low over the Mediterranean Sea which increased convection near the cold front, and it provided unstable air parcels, reduced evaporation, and added moisture to the mid-levels of the airmass over France.[44][45] Leslie's remnant was absorbed into Hurricane Michael's extratropical remnant by 16 October, following a brief Fujiwhara interaction.[43][46][47][48]"

Additional funds were donated to finance the planting of over 35,000 additional trees.[109] Near the Palace Hotel, 100 trees were planted in an area damaged by Leslie in order to honor the life of Nelson Mandela.[158] Despite being considered a public interest, the 300-year-old ash tree was cut down on 14 November 2019.[121] Months after Leslie, students protested about the condition of the College of Arts building at the University of Coimbra, which was one of those damaged during the storm.[159] In Chernache, the Aerodrome Bissaya Barreto was closed from 30 May\u20137 June 2019, due to additional problems after Leslie had removed its windsock.[160] Around 10,000 personnel were mobilized to deal with fallen trees and landslides in Mira.[103] Municipal authorities worked to clear fallen trees and repair broken walls and signage.[102] Authorities activated the emergency municipal plan in Montemor-o-Velho, Figueira da Foz, Condeixa-a-Nova, Soure, Coimbra, and Mira to aid with cleanup and relief efforts.[161][162] The district emergency plan was activated for Coimbra district.[62] Fifty generators were provided by Pombal municipal officials to restore power to residences and small businesses.[113] The Portuguese government anticipated an expenditure of \u20ac36\u00a0million (US$43.8\u00a0million) would be required to aid the forest industry.[163] Fisheries near Figueira da Foz operated at below normal capacity through 2020, due to a reduction in sardine supply that occurred after Leslie moved through the area.[164] Although the Portuguese government agreed to cover 70 percent of the costs of reconstruction for the Equestrian Center of Montemor-o-Velho, it had not provided the funds two years post-storm.[105] Initially, on 27 November 2018, the Portuguese government rejected a proposal to provide relief funds for victims of the storm.[165] The government provided \u20ac1.4\u00a0million (US$1.7\u00a0million) out of a maximum of \u20ac8.3\u00a0million (US$10.1\u00a0million) in aid to 24 municipalities in 2019.[166] They provided another \u20ac3.6\u00a0million (US$4.3\u00a0million) to those municipalities in 2020.[88][167][168] The legislature allocated \u20ac20\u00a0million (US$24.3\u00a0million) in aid to the agricultural sector.[84][169][170] The Portuguese government opened up \u20ac15\u00a0million (US$17.7\u00a0million) in relief funds for farmers who sustained damage to buildings, equipment, livestock, and permanent crops.[171] At least seven companies received financial aid totalling \u20ac391,000 (US$478,000).[172] Social organizations that experienced large financial woes had not received relief funding from the Portuguese government two years after the storm.[173] The legislative body was criticised for being slow in authorising the release of funds to these organizations.[174] The Coimbra City Council approved a measure on 30 June to repair the Celas Integrated Sports Center and a building at the Campo Municipal da Arrega\u00e7a, both of which were severely damaged by Leslie.[175] Despite repairs having taken place at the sports center, it remained closed nearly a year after Leslie passed through the region.[176] In 2021, the Rural Development Program provided \u20ac98,000 (US$120,000) in aid to help repair damage caused in the Choupal National Forest. At least 5,000 new trees were to be planted and 700 damaged ones either cut down or trimmed.[177] To aid recovery efforts, \u20ac5\u00a0million (US$6.1\u00a0million) in funds were approved for a recovery plan for the Leiria National Forest in the Marinha Grande Municipality. The plan included the planting of at least 230 trees to restore the forest after Leslie and a 2017 fire destroyed most of it.[178] The Miranda do Corvo city council approved \u20ac74,850 (US$91,400) in funds to rebuild the Senhor da Serra Pavilion, which was entirely destroyed by the storm.[179] The council also approved \u20ac34,085 (US$41,600) in aid to repair the headquarters for the Vale do A\u00e7or Recreational, Cultural and Sports Association.[180]"

The Col de la Quillane, elevation 1,713 metres (5,620\u00a0ft), marks the boundary of the watershed. The river then flows into the Mediterranean Sea a few kilometres from Narbonne at Grau de Vendres (near Cabanes-de-Fleury) on the border between the departments of Aude and H\u00e9rault. At Carcassonne in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es its course is oriented north-south. The Aude then presents the characteristics of a mountain stream as it traverses Capcir and feeds several reservoirs (Matemale, Puyvalador) before plunging into gorges (those of Saint-Georges are the most scenic) crossing ancient terrain. Starting from Axat, after being joined by the Aiguette on the right bank and the R\u00e9benty on the left bank, the river flows through bands of pre-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9en limestone (in the Pierre-Lys Gorges) and passes through a series of small communes: Quillan, Esp\u00e9raza, Couiza, Alet-les-Bains, then Limoux. Downstream of this great medieval city, the Aude flows eastwards. This elbow results from a Stream capture, the Aude having once flowed in the valley of the Hers, indicating a deepening by an ancient hydrology following the uplifting of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.[7] From Carcassonne, the river becomes calmer following the great tectonic furrow which separates the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (Corbi\u00e8res) from the Massif Central (Montagne Noire), receiving from these heights a series of tributaries of which the main ones are the Orbieu on the right bank, and the Argent-Double and the Casse on the left bank. From this point, bordered by the Canal du Midi and sinuous amid vineyards, the Aude enters the broad alluvial plain of Narbonne with the main stream flowing to the Gulf of Lion and some waters diverted to a network of ancient ponds before flowing into the Mediterranean Sea ."

The Aude is thus characterized in its lower course by a pluvio-nival regime of meridional type with high baseflow in summer, 9.8 cubic metres per second (350\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) in August at Moussan[3] in the lower alluvial plain not far from the river mouth, against an average of 44.2 cubic metres per second (1,560\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). Heavy autumnal rains enable a rapid rise in the flow rate which peaks in February, 78.6 cubic metres per second (2,780\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) and is supported by the spring snowmelt from the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es mountains."

Up to 620 millimetres (24\u00a0in) fell in two days at L\u00e9zignan-Corbi\u00e8res, that is to say more than the average annual total.

Moorland east of the county boundary with West Yorkshire is known as Wessenden Moor and Wessenden Head Moor. The moor is crossed by the A635 between the Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire Urban Areas. The A635 is known locally as the Isle of Skye road, taking the name from a former public house at Wessenden Head, Upperthong that was demolished after a fire.[4][5] The Pennine Way arrives from the Wessenden Valley to the north and crosses the moor on its ascent to Black Hill on Holme Moss to the south. The high moorland is sparsely inhabited. Scattered farmsteads, built of gritstone, and fields demarcated by dry stone walls are on the lower land and in the valleys where there is some coniferous woodland.

In October 1965, following their arrest for the murder of Edward Evans in Hattersley, the bodies of Lesley Ann Downey and John Kilbride were discovered buried on the moors. Kilbride had been murdered on the moors by Brady on 23 November 1963; Downey had been murdered, at the couple's house, on Boxing Day 1964, before being buried on the moor the next day. The police were led to Saddleworth Moor by photographs found among Brady's possessions, and claims by Hindley's brother-in-law that Brady had boasted of committing several murders and burying the bodies on the moor. The body of Pauline Reade, their first victim, who had been murdered in July 1963, was recovered on 1 July 1987, a year after the pair admitted the murder. They also admitted murdering Keith Bennett and burying his body on the moors in June 1964.[9] On 30 September 2022 Greater Manchester Police searched for the body of Bennett after receiving information from amateur investigator and author Russell Edwards.[10] On 7 October the police announced they had ended their search without finding any sign of human remains.[11] In December 2015, the body of an unknown man was found beneath Rob's Rocks on the track between Chew and Dovestone Reservoirs. He had died of strychnine poisoning.[12] He was identified in January 2017 as David Lytton who had flown from Pakistan two days before his body was found.[13] A wildfire broke out on the moor on 24 June 2018, resulting in mass evacuations and damage to a large area. Fifty homes were evacuated and about 150 people have been affected in Carrbrook, near Stalybridge. On 30 June firefighters were still fighting the blaze. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said a \"request to the military for extra support\" was being prepared \"so there is a back-up plan\" to support firefighters[14] and the military have been brought in.[15] As a peat moor, the fire burns primarily underground before setting different parts of the moor alight, which makes it particularly hard to fight as well as releasing excessive smoke and reaching extremely high temperatures. It was predicted by fire chiefs that it could grow on for another few weeks after the fire first ignited.[16] Jonathan Reynolds said ministers would \"need to look seriously at our capacity to deal with these kinds of fires in future, including military capacity we might have lost in recent years\".[17] In February 2019, on the warmest winter day on record, a blaze, described by witnesses as \"apocalyptic\" occurred on the moor.[18]"

Carlotta, the third named storm of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, formed as the result of a breakdown in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. On June 12, a broad area of low pressure developed several hundred miles south of Mexico and strengthened into a tropical storm by June 15. The next day, the system stalled unexpectedly within a favorable environment, which led to more intensification than originally anticipated. Early on June 17, Carlotta reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 997 mbar (29.44 inHg) while located only 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) south-southeast of Acapulco. The system then began to interact with land and experience wind shear, which resulted in the storm weakening to tropical depression status later in the day. The system weakened to a remnant low early on June 19 and dissipated several hours later. Carlotta prompted the issuance of multiple watches and warnings for the southern coast of Mexico. The storm caused three deaths, two of which were in Aguascalientes and the other in Oaxaca. Flooding and landslides also occurred throughout the states of Aguascalientes, Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n, Oaxaca, and Puebla, as well as in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.

A tropical wave that traversed Central America around June 11 may have contributed to the storm's formation as well.[1] On June 12, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that a broad area of low pressure had formed several hundred miles south of southeastern Mexico.[2] The NHC continued to monitor the disturbance over the next two days as it drifted northward.[3] Initially, strong upper-level winds prevented development,[2] but the system increased in organization unexpectedly on June 14.[4] Following further structural improvements, the NHC upgraded the system to tropical depression status at 18:00 UTC while it was located about 140\u00a0mi (220\u00a0km) south of Acapulco.[1] Around that time, the NHC forecast that a mid-level ridge over Mexico would weaken the following day, and would leave the depression in an area of light steering currents.[5] Despite being located in a favorable environment with low to moderate wind shear and sea surface temperatures exceeding 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C),[6] the depression experienced minimal change in intensity over the next 18 hours. After the system's center reformed farther north, the NHC amended its intensity forecast to indicate reduced strengthening, citing the fact that the system would spend less time over water.[7] Around 18:00 UTC on June 15, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, after which it was assigned the name Carlotta. The system's intensity then leveled off for about twelve hours.[1] Early on June 16, Carlotta's forward motion began to fluctuate, changing from northeast to southeast in six hours.[8] The storm began to intensify again around 06:00 UTC as it stalled off the coast of Mexico.[1][9] Soon after, the cyclone began moving in a northerly direction.[10] Over the next twelve hours, Carlotta experienced little change in organization before peaking at 00:00 UTC on June 17, with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 997 mbar (29.44 inHg) while located only 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) south-southeast of Acapulco.[1] Around that time, the NHC noted that the system's structure had improved significantly, with a contracting eye and more symmetric eyewall.[11] As the system started tracking towards the northwest, Carlotta began to weaken because of increasing interaction with land and northerly wind shear.[12] Around 18:00 UTC on the June 17, the storm weakened into a tropical depression after lacking organized deep convection for several hours.[1][13] Over the next day, the depression continued to weaken before degenerating into a remnant low on June 19 at 00:00 UTC.[1] Shortly afterwards, Carlotta's upper-level circulation decoupled entirely and drifted towards the southwest, while the low- and mid-level remnants remained.[14] The system's remnants dissipated around 06:00 UTC while located offshore of the Mexican coast between Manzanillo and Zihuatanejo, having never made landfall as a tropical cyclone.[1]"

        "content": "On June 14 at 21:00 UTC, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for Tecpan de Galeana to Punta Maldonado,[15] which was upgraded to a tropical storm warning six hours later.[16] At 15:00 UTC, the next day, the tropical storm warning was extended to Lagunas de Chacahua.[17] Six hours later, the warning was discontinued for Tecpan de Galeana to west of Acapulco.[18] On June 17 at 03:00 UTC, the warning was extended westward from Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana and cancelled to the east of Punta Maldonado.[19] At 09:00 UTC, the warning was discontinued east of Tecpan de Galeana and extended westward to Lazaro Cardenas.[20] The tropical storm warning was canceled at 18:00 UTC, after the storm weakened into a tropical depression.[21] Tropical Storm Carlotta caused flooding in southern Mexico, with the states of Aguascalientes, Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n, Oaxaca, and Puebla, being affected, as well as the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. In the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Carlotta, a tropical wave, and another low-pressure system dropped 70\u2013400\u00a0mm (3\u201320\u00a0in) of rain, causing severe flooding.[22][23] In the Tizim\u00edn Municipality, the Popoln\u00e1h police station was inundated and the DN-III-E Plan, a plan for the coordination of search and rescue operations and disaster aid, was activated to help with recovery efforts.[23] In Oaxaca, severe flooding killed one individual. Fishermen recovered the body of a 29-year-old man about 10\u00a0mi (20\u00a0km) off the coast after he was dragged away by flood waters and drowned.[24] The proximity of the storm prompted the closure of the ports of Huatulco, Puerto \u00c1ngel, and Puerto Escondido as well as the suspension of fishing operations.[25] Multiple landslides also occurred as a result of the extreme rainfall.[26][27] Only minor damage was reported in Guerrero. In the Costa Chica region, the storm damaged several palapas on a beach and the fishing equipment of at least 80\u00a0families, preventing them from working.[28] In the municipalities of Tecpan de Galeana, Zihuatanejo and Petatl\u00e1n, 42\u00a0homes were inundated by flood waters. A total of 138\u00a0trees were downed in Acapulco and several other municipalities. In Acapulco, a hospital sustained damage to its windows and four injuries were reported. Additionally, 32\u00a0neighborhoods lost power, nine\u00a0houses lost their roofs, and 11\u00a0roads collapsed.[29][30] In Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla, homes and businesses were flooded, multiple cars were stranded, and several trees fell. Nearby, a state highway and a bridge collapsed, cutting off several towns in the area.[31] In Michoac\u00e1n, multiple cities along the coast experienced severe flooding. In Melchor Ocampo, a peak rainfall total of 285.0\u00a0mm (11.2\u00a0in) occurred. Approximately 211\u00a0mm (8.31\u00a0in) of rain fell in La Villita while 195\u00a0mm (7.68\u00a0in) was recorded in Presa La Villita.[22] Rainfall caused the Acalpican River to overflow its banks.[32] In the Tiquicheo Municipality, 10\u00a0houses were flooded after a river near the city overflowed its banks.[33] Multiple homes were inundated in the Zamora Municipality. In P\u00e1tzcuaro, multiple landslides occurred, damaging roads in the region. In Nuevo Urecho, the overflow of the Los Hervores River damaged water pumps, resulting in a water shortage throughout the municipality.[34] Throughout the storm, 35\u00a0temporary shelters were in operation in Michoac\u00e1n.[35][32] The insurance claims statewide reached MX$156\u00a0million (US$7.6\u00a0million).[36] In Aguascalientes, Carlotta caused infrastructural damage and two indirect deaths in Aguascalientes City. Rainfall from the system flooded streets, sweeping away dozens of cars and prompting the rescue of several people. Two women became trapped in their vehicle because of rising flood waters and died of carbon monoxide poisoning.[37][38] After 57\u00a0mm (2.2\u00a0in) of rain fell,[39] the city's drainage system failed,[38] 12 houses were flooded, and 12 trees fell.[37] A waterspout was reported in the state. Mexican authorities alerted the public that the El Cedazo dam had the potential to overflow because of the heavy rainfall,[38][39] although this did not occur.[40]"

By 11:30 pm, the air began to warm and the wind increased. Dust began to restrict visibility. Electrical power became sporadic throughout the city by early morning.[1] By 9:00 am school was cancelled, and parents were asked to pick up their children because of the concern that school buses might tip over in the wind.[2] By late morning, the wind became a loud roar. Enough dust was in the air that it blocked out the sun. Roads into and out of the southern valley were closed. Only one TV station and two or three AM radio stations continued to have power and were able to broadcast. Also, since Bakersfield did not have a direct feed to national news broadcast, no one outside of the area knew the severity of the situation.[1] Wind continued to blow throughout the afternoon and evening. Swamp coolers were blown off the roofs of buildings. Windows were shattering and store signs were blowing in the wind. It was described as if a twister was unrolled and blew up the valley in a sheet. Farther north in the valley, Fresno was having typical December rain. When the dust reached the rain, it turned into mud. It fell in sheets from the sky.[3] People awoke the next morning to a dark sky. The wind had blown throughout the night and was continuing in the morning. Schools remained closed that day. By the afternoon, the wind began to subside, and the air started to clear.[1]"

        "content": "By the afternoon of December 21, people began to see the damage from the dust storm. The result was devastating. Trees, fences, and swamp coolers had blown down throughout the region. Below grade freeways, canals, and creeks were buried. Dirt had piled up on the south side of the buildings. Dust had seeped into cracks and crevices of buildings, filling the interior with a layer of dust.[4] After several days, the roads were reopened and news reports started leaving the valley. People also started digging out and cleaning up. By spring, not all of the canals and creeks were cleared. As a result, the rain caused them to flood.[1] The storm resulted in five deaths and $40 million in damage. Over 25\u00a0million cubic feet (710,000\u00a0m3) of topsoil from grazing land alone was moved. Wind was measured at 192 miles per hour (309\u00a0km/h) in Arvin (southeast of Bakersfield).[5] In the foothills, the wind was measured at 189 miles per hour (304\u00a0km/h). In the mountain passes, it was 199 miles per hour (320\u00a0km/h).[6]"

Cotton had recently been plowed under (end of the season) but the winter crop had not taken root yet. This caused the soil to be loose.[1] The high winds were also caused by a series of events. Over the Great Basin, which is located in Nevada and Idaho, the air was very cold and heavy (high pressure). A very strong low pressure system was approaching the northwest coast of California. A mercury reading of 0.10\u00a0inHg (3.4\u00a0hPa)of pressure gradient force (difference of pressure between two points) is typically needed for a 12-mile-per-hour (19\u00a0km/h) northwestern wind.

The fourth depression and third named storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, Chantal developed from a tropical wave on August\u00a014 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It tracked rapidly westward for much of its duration, and after degenerating into a tropical wave, it passed through the Windward Islands. Chantal reached a peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) twice in the Caribbean Sea, and each time it was anticipated to attain hurricane status; however, wind shear and later land interaction prevented strengthening to hurricane status. On August\u00a021 Chantal, moved ashore near the border of Mexico and Belize, before dissipating on the next day. In the Windward Islands, lightning caused two indirect deaths in Trinidad. Chantal dropped light to moderate rainfall across its path, most significantly in Quintana Roo in Mexico where it caused widespread mudslides. Damage in Belize totaled $4\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD; $6.88\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD), due to the combined impact of high waves, moderate winds, and rainfall. Overall damage was minor."

        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August\u00a011. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August\u00a013 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave.[1] Environmental conditions favored tropical development, and the system gradually became better organized,[2] although convection was initially limited near the center.[3] On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the system to be considered a tropical depression; at the time, it was located about 1500\u00a0miles (2400\u00a0km) east of the southern Windward Islands.[1] Situated to the south of a strong subtropical ridge, the depression tracked rapidly westward. With easterly wind shear, the structure was initially disorganized,[1] although the system was forecast to attain tropical storm status within 48\u00a0hours of developing, due to anticipated favorable conditions.[4] One computer model predicted the depression would reach winds of around 115\u00a0miles per hour (185\u00a0km/h) by four days after development.[5] Banding features increased while the satellite presentation continued to improve,[1] and at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016 the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal about 370\u00a0miles (595\u00a0km) east of Barbados.[6] At the same time however, a QuikSCAT pass suggested the system did not contain a low-level circulation, and in post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center estimated the system degenerated into a tropical wave rather than attain tropical storm status.[1] This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system.[7] Despite lacking a closed circulation, the overall structure remained well-organized, and with a favorable upper-level environment the possibility of regeneration into a tropical cyclone was noted.[7] Early on August\u00a017, the remnants of Chantal passed over the Windward Islands with winds of tropical storm force. After entering the Caribbean Sea, the system slowed while its convective pattern expanded and became more symmetric. Hurricane Hunters confirmed that a small circulation developed about 290\u00a0miles (265\u00a0km) south of Saint Croix, and accordingly the system developed into a tropical storm.[1] Forecasters described the upper-level environment as \"ideal for [a] tropical cyclone to intensify\", with winds of 80\u00a0miles per hour (130\u00a0km/h) forecast within a few days. The cyclone was predicted to maintain a west-northwestward track toward the northwestern Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.[8] On August 18, the winds increased to 65\u00a0miles per hour (105\u00a0km/h), although an increase in forward motion caused the low-level circulation to become separated from the deep convection. The storm again decelerated on August 19, allowing re-organization and for Chantal to attain peak sustained winds of 70\u00a0miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h) about 185\u00a0miles (295\u00a0km) south of Kingston, Jamaica.[1] After reaching peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized while the center became ill-defined and situated to the west-southwest of the main area of convection;[1] this was due to unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued to forecast a more favorable upper-level environment.[9] By early on August\u00a020, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area.[10] Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70\u00a0miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h) before making landfall early on August\u00a021 near the border of Mexico and Belize.[1] Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Bay of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz.[11] Chantal slowly weakened over land while moving slowly across northern Belize.[12] Convection decreased markedly late on August\u00a021,[13] and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status.[1] The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland.[14] Weakening continued, and late on August\u00a022 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.[1]"

The following day the watches were changed to warnings, since forecasters predicted that the system would reach tropical storm status. Additional watches and warnings were also issued for the rest of Windward Islands.[1] Late on August\u00a017, the government of Jamaica issued a hurricane watch for the island, due to anticipated strengthening. The next day, it was upgraded to a hurricane warning briefly before being amended to a tropical storm warning, due to the storm's weakening in the central Caribbean.[1] In the country, officials advised fishermen to return to harbor,[15] while some flights into Norman Manley International Airport were canceled.[16] A tropical storm warning was also issued for the Cayman Islands,[1] where an emergency shelter was opened.[17] There, tourists were recommended to temporarily leave the islands.[15] About 50\u00a0hours before landfall, a tropical storm watch was issued for Belize and the eastern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and about 12\u00a0hours later it was upgraded to a hurricane watch. When the lack of significant intensification became apparent, a tropical storm warning was added for much of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and later for a portion of the Mexican coast along the Bay of Campeche. As the storm approached, nearly 2,500\u00a0people in vulnerable areas of eastern Mexico evacuated to safer areas. About 8,000\u00a0people evacuated in Belize, primarily on offshore islands.[1] The government of Belize opened its emergency operation center and evacuated several hospitals.[18] About 250\u00a0airline flights were canceled, and some cruise ship paths were diverted to safer locations.[19]"

The island of Martinique reported sustained winds of 39\u00a0miles per hour (63\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 56\u00a0miles per hour (91\u00a0km/h).[1] On August\u00a016, lightning from the system killed two brothers in southern Trinidad.[16] Also on the island, heavy rainfall caused flooding and road washouts.[20] While tracking across the eastern Caribbean Sea, the outer rainbands of Chantal produced light to moderate rainfall across Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the highest rainfall total was 2.4 inches (61\u00a0mm) in Rio Piedras.[21] Passing to the south of Jamaica, the storm produced light rainfall and gusty winds.[22] The outer rainbands also affected the Cayman Islands.[23] In Belize, the tropical storm produced a wind gust of 71\u00a0miles per hour (115\u00a0km/h) in Caye Caulker, although stronger winds were possible in a convective band to the north. Moderate rainfall was reported across the country, peaking at 9.81\u00a0inches (249\u00a0mm) at Towerhill station. Along the coast, high waves damaged seawalls and piers. Further inland, the combination of winds and flooding caused agriculture and infrastructure damage; overall damage in the country totaled $4\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD; $6.88\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[1] Tropical Storm Chantal also produced gusty winds in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, peaking at 62\u00a0miles per hour (100\u00a0km/h) in Chetumal, Quintana Roo.[1] Dropping moderate to heavy rainfall along its path, a station near Chetumal reported a peak total of 20.03\u00a0inches (509\u00a0mm). The remnants of Chantal also produced rainfall along the Bay of Campeche coast.[21] The storm resulted in downed trees and power lines, as well as damaged buildings.[1][24] Heavy rainfall led to mudslides across Quintana Roo, leaving some areas isolated.[25] Initially, there were reports of two missing fishermen off the southeastern coast,[26] although it was not later confirmed.

        "content": " The 1891 Atlantic hurricane season began during the summer and ran through the late fall of 1891. The season had ten tropical cyclones. Seven of these became hurricanes; one becoming a major Category 3 hurricane. Because there were no modern satellite or other remote-sensing technologies, only cyclones that affected populated land areas or that encountered ships at sea are currently known, so the true total could be higher. For the years 1886 through 1910, an undercount bias of zero to four tropical cyclones per year has been estimated.[1] The tracks of four of the ten cyclones were revised in 1996 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas.[2] Following re-analysis in 2003, two storms previously considered distinct are now regarded as a single system, Tropical Storm 8. A number of other storms from 1891 were considered for inclusion in the Atlantic hurricane database, HURDAT, but are currently excluded due to a lack of evidence of tropical storm intensity.[3]"

Around 22:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05, the hurricane made landfall near present-day Freeport, Texas.[4] Upon the cyclone's landfall, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that it had a barometric pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg) based on the pressure-wind relationship.[3] The hurricane curved north-northeastward and quickly weakened to a tropical storm by early on July\u00a06. Weakening to a tropical depression late on the following day, the system dissipated on July\u00a08 near the Alabama-Mississippi-Tennessee state line.[4] In Texas, storm surge flooded sections of Galveston,[5] while washing out some street car tracks and destroying part of the breakwater at the Beach Hotel. Winds and rain also left power outages in the city.[6] Tornadoes spawned by the hurricane in Louisiana demolished one hundred homes in Baton Rouge and caused two floors of the state penitentiary to collapse, killing ten prisoners.[2] Among the many other buildings damaged was the Louisiana Governor's Mansion, losing its roof and consequently being flooded.[7] Another tornado was reported in Madison, Mississippi, destroying several buildings and downing many telegraph wires.[8]"

J. Neumann in 1993. Although the storm was not detected prior to August\u00a026,[2] it likely moved west-northwestward and intensified into a hurricane on August\u00a019. The cyclone gradually shifted to a more northwestward motion over the next several days, and on August\u00a027, it passed just under 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) east of Bermuda.[4] Barometric pressures on the island fell to 997\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). This, as well as observations from the steamers Dunsmurry and La Touraine, led the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project to conclude that the storm did not intensity beyond a minimal hurricane with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[3] Considered the worst cyclone to impact Bermuda since 1880, the hurricane downed brick walls, trees, and telegraph wires.[9] Early on August\u00a029, the storm became extratropical about 220\u00a0mi (355\u00a0km) south-southeast of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia.[4] Chenoweth proposed a tropical depression phase to the storm's earlier stages and a more southerly track, although the system instead turned northeastward after passing Bermuda and became extratropical near Newfoundland.[10]"

The hurricane tracked northwestward and intensified into a major Category\u00a03 hurricane. Late on August\u00a018, the cyclone struck Martinique at its peak intensity with sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 961\u00a0mbar (28.4\u00a0inHg). The storm weakened over the northeastern Caribbean and fell to Category\u00a02 intensity early on August\u00a020. Several hours later, the system turned northward and brushed the extreme eastern edge of the Dominican Republic with winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h). Resuming its northwestward motion on August\u00a021, the cyclone passed north of Grand Turk early the next day. The hurricane continued to weaken while traveling northwestward through the Bahamas and passed directly over Crooked Island. On August\u00a023, a ridge of high pressure situated off the southeast coast of the United States prevented the storm, which had weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane, from curving back to the north. Instead, the cyclone struck Florida near Homestead on August\u00a024 and subsequently moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it dissipated on August\u00a025.[4] On Martinique, the storm destroyed houses, crops, and trees across the entire island. Fifty boats in harbors around Martinique were damaged or destroyed. At Ducos, only four homes remained following the storm, and at St. Pierre, at least 34\u00a0people lost their lives. At Fort de France, twenty people were killed. A military camp at Balata was destroyed, with a number of soldiers there sustaining injuries from airborne debris.[11] Property damage across the island reached approximately $10\u00a0million.[2] In total, the hurricane killed approximately 700\u00a0people on Martinique.[12] Puerto Rico observed heavy rainfall and hurricane-force wind gusts. The Humacao River overflowed, inundating the city. Waterways between Cabo Rojo and Hormigueros also exceeded their banks, flooding many low-lying areas and sweeping animals away.[2] The steamship Ozama reported hundreds of downed fruit trees and numerous damaged homes in the Dominican Republic.[13] The storm drowned three people on Grand Turk and damaged some small homes and vessels.[2] In South Florida, the cyclone also produced hurricane-force winds that blew boats ashore near present-day Cutler.[14]"

When the hurricane made landfall in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on September\u00a08, it destroyed a number of small vessels[2] but then quickly weakened and dissipated north of Newfoundland in the Labrador Sea on September\u00a010.[4] In Nova Scotia, the storm was compared to a hurricane in 1873.[15] Observed sustained winds reached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), causing \"great destruction to crops, shipping, and buildings\", according to The Huddersfield Daily Chronicle. Damage to fruit crops totaled nearly $58,000. The storm also partially destroyed a drain elevator and several small bridges,[16] while about two-thirds of a larger railroad bridge linking Halifax and Dartmouth collapsed, causing more than $50,000 in damage.[15] Rough seas beached a few schooners and several Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron vessels in the Halifax area, while hundreds of other small watercraft suffered some degree of damage.

Notably, the storm disturbed Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the country after the victims of Typhoon Haiyan on November 8, 2013. Although the storm also caused an airplane crash in Tacloban, nobody was hurt in the incident. The system developed on January\u00a013 between the Philippines and Guam. Moving west-northwest for its duration, Mekkhala passed north of Yap State on January\u00a014 while slowly intensifying due to moderate wind shear. Conditions became more favorable on January\u00a016, when the storm quickly strengthened to peak winds of at least 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph); a ragged eye prompted the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to upgrade it to a typhoon.

Damage in the region amounted to \u20b1318.7\u00a0million (US$7.13\u00a0million), stemming mostly from agriculture.[26] In addition, the storm caused agricultural damage of \u20b130.3\u00a0million (US$678,000) in Samar.[27] The crop damage and a subsequent drought caused rice shortages in the country, prompting the government to import the grain in May 2015.[28] Throughout the country, 48\u00a0homes were destroyed while a further 490\u00a0sustained damage.[27] Infrastructural losses reached \u20b149.7\u00a0million (US$1.11\u00a0million); repairs to roadways was quick and completed by January\u00a021.[26] A volunteer from the Bicol Region, who worked for a Catholic Relief Services station in Salcedo, Eastern Samar, was hit by a soundbox due to a collapsed scaffolding caused by heavy winds during a papal Mass held in Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport in Tacloban, Leyte.[29] To comfort Tacloban people who suffered from the devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and Typhoon Hagupit a month prior, Pope Francis visited the storm-ravaged city on January 17. However, the schedule was significantly impacted by Severe Tropical Storm Mekkhala and thousands of pilgrims and the Pope wore their raincoats during the rain-soaked Mass in the airport.[30] Only minutes after Pope Francis\u2019 aircraft left the airport, a private jet was veered off the runway by strong winds of Mekkhala and eventually crashed. The 15\u00a0passengers on the plane were all safe, including officials from the Cabinet of the Philippines.[31]"

The storm formed near Cape Verde on August 4 and crossed the Atlantic, turning northward around Bermuda before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while situated southeast of Newfoundland. Irene proved to be a difficult storm to forecast due to oscillations in strength. After almost dissipating on August 10, Irene peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on August 16. Irene persisted for 14 days as a tropical system, the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season. It was the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the record-breaking season. Although there were initial fears of a landfall in the United States due to uncertainty in predicting the storm's track, Hurricane Irene never approached land and caused no recorded damage; however, swells up to 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) and strong rip currents resulted in one fatality in Long Beach, New York."

        "content": "Hurricane Irene began as a Cape Verde storm. A vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on August 1, initially weakening due to cooler sea surface temperatures. It moved westward and passed near Cape Verde, where convection started to increase. The system subsequently developed into a tropical depression on the afternoon of August\u00a04, 690\u00a0miles (1100\u00a0km) southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.[1] Early on August 5, the depression abruptly turned to the northwest into an area of higher wind shear, causing some computer models to predict that the depression would dissipate, while others predicted steady strengthening. The sudden threat to the storm's existence prompted National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecaster Lixion Avila to comment, \"How little we know about the genesis of tropical cyclones.\"[2] Despite the unfavorable conditions in its vicinity and its poor organization, Tropical Depression Nine continued to strengthen, becoming Tropical Storm Irene on August 7,[1] the earliest formation date for the ninth storm in the Atlantic basin at the time, beating the previous record held by a storm in the 1936 season by 13 days. (This record stood until surpassed by Hurricane Isaias in 2020.)[3] Because Irene was in an environment laden with dry air and high shear, it soon weakened to a tropical depression, on August 8.[1] On the morning of August 10, as it was passing north of the Lesser Antilles, Irene nearly dissipated into a remnant low, but forecasters predicted with \"very low confidence\" that the storm would survive.[4] Contrary to these expectations, warmer waters and less wind shear allowed Irene to become gradually more organized while south of Bermuda, and it became a tropical storm once again early on August 11.[1] Due to uncertainties about how the region's subtropical ridge would interact with Irene, the models continued to give unclear signals of the storm's future. Some of the models predicted that Irene would make landfall in North Carolina, while others continued to anticipate that Irene would dissipate.[5] The uncertainty ended when a weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed Irene to turn sharply northward, which caused the storm to pass midway between the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Bermuda on August 15. Soon after, upper-level shear weakened greatly, and Irene rapidly intensified, first to a hurricane, then to its peak strength as a 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h) Category 2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 16, while located 350\u00a0miles (560\u00a0km) northeast of Bermuda; at the same time it also attained minimum pressure of 970\u00a0mbar.[1] Though NHC meteorologists thought it was likely that Irene would become a hurricane, they were not expecting an intensification of such a magnitude.[6] Irene entered a region of increased wind shear and began to weaken, and as a result it was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 18, when it was 520\u00a0miles (830\u00a0km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. All convection within 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) of the cyclone dissipated on August\u00a018. Irene was subsequently absorbed by an extratropical cyclone later that day.[1] Irene lasted for 14\u00a0days as a tropical system, the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season.[3]"

Despite Irene's long life there were no reports of tropical storm force winds affecting ships. There was no damage as a result of Irene.[1] However, the hurricane generated strong waves and increased the risk of rip currents along the East Coast of the United States. Many beaches in New Jersey restricted swimming activities, and lifeguards at one beach performed more than a hundred rescues over a three-day period.[7] Waves along the coastline of New York reached 4 to 8\u00a0ft (1.2 to 2.4\u00a0m). A 16-year-old boy drowned after being caught in a rip current near Long Beach, New York on August 14.[8][9] His body was recovered on August 16 after washing ashore.[8]"

        "content": "Hurricane Esther was the first large tropical cyclone to be discovered by satellite imagery. The fifth tropical cyclone, named storm, and hurricane of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Esther developed from an area of disturbed weather hundreds of miles west-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands on September\u00a010. Moving northwestward, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Esther on September\u00a011, before reaching hurricane intensity on the following day. Early on September\u00a013, Esther curved westward and deepened into a major hurricane. The storm remained a Category\u00a03 hurricane for about four days and gradually moved in a west-northwestward direction. Late on September\u00a017, Esther strengthened into a Category\u00a05 hurricane with sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a018. The storm curved north-northeastward on September\u00a019, while offshore of North Carolina. Esther began to weaken while approaching New England and fell to Category\u00a03 intensity on September\u00a021. The storm turned eastward early on the following day, and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm. Esther then executed a large cyclonic loop, until curving northward on September\u00a025. Early on the following day, Esther struck Cape Cod, hours before emerging into the Gulf of Maine. Later on September\u00a026, the storm made landfall in southeastern Maine, before weakening to a tropical depression and becoming extratropical over southeastern Quebec. The remnants persisted for about 12\u00a0hours, before dissipating early on September\u00a027. Between North Carolina and New Jersey, effects were primarily limited to strong winds and minor beach erosion and coastal flooding due to storm surge. In New York, strong winds led to severe crop losses and over 300,000\u00a0power outages. High tides caused coastal flooding and damage to a number of pleasure boats. Similar impact was reported in Massachusetts. Additionally, some areas observed more than 8 inches (203\u00a0mm) of rainfall, flooding basements, low-lying roads, and underpasses. Overall, damage was minor, totaling about $6\u00a0million (1961\u00a0USD). There were also seven deaths reported when a United States Navy P5M aircraft crashed about 120 miles (190\u00a0km) north of Bermuda."

        "content": "On September\u00a010, the Television Infrared Observation Satellite observed an area of convection, or thunderstorms, to the southwest of the Cape Verde islands, suggesting the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis.[1] At 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, a tropical depression formed and subsequently moved on a northwest trajectory.[2] By the time the Hurricane Hunters reached the system on September\u00a012, winds of hurricane force were recorded,[3] and as such, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau began issuing warnings on Hurricane Esther.[1] It was later estimated that the system attained tropical storm status on September\u00a011,[2] although the National Hurricane Center later noted that it could have attained hurricane status by this date, thus potentially being one of four simultaneous hurricanes, along with hurricanes Betsy, Carla, and Debbie. The only other such occasions were in 1893 and 1998.[4] This also made Esther the first hurricane to be discovered by satellite imagery, although not the first to be imaged by one.[5] After becoming a hurricane, Esther turned more to the west-northwest, influenced by the strengthening Bermuda High that built behind Hurricane Debbie well to the north.[3] By September\u00a013, the storm attained major hurricane status, which is a Category\u00a03 on the current-day Saffir-Simpson scale with sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h).[2] By that time, the gale force winds extended about 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) from the center, with hurricane-force winds spreading 135\u00a0mi (217\u00a0km) to the north.[1] After maintaining winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) for about two days, Esther weakened slightly on September\u00a016 while passing well north of the Lesser Antilles.[2] On the next day, the hurricane passed about 375\u00a0mi (604\u00a0km) north of Puerto Rico. Late on September\u00a017, the barometric pressure fell to 927\u00a0mbar (92.7\u00a0kPa; 27.4\u00a0inHg) in the center of Esther, and operationally the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[1] This was later lowered slightly to 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), which would be its peak intensity attained on September\u00a018, making it a Category 4 hurricane.[2] However, reanalysis as part of the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project concluded that Esther was in fact a Category\u00a05 hurricane with winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 919\u00a0mbar (91.9\u00a0kPa; 27.1\u00a0inHg); this has now been officially incorporated into HURDAT.[6] Around the time of attaining peak winds, Esther began moving more to the northwest toward the east coast of the United States, influenced by a dissipating cold front that exited the coast on September\u00a015. On September\u00a020, the hurricane passed about 120\u00a0mi (193\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras while turning to the north-northeast while gradually weakening.[3] It continued up the coastline, later passing about 150\u00a0mi (241\u00a0km) east of the Delmarva Peninsula.[1] Another trough from the west steered Esther to the northeast and was expected to cause the storm to accelerate,[3] potentially bringing it over Cape Cod. While turning, the hurricane passed about 110\u00a0mi (177\u00a0km) south of the eastern tip of Long Island, 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) southeast of Block Island,[1] and just 27\u00a0mi (43\u00a0km) south of Nantucket Island, while a Category 1 hurricane at the time. After the trough bypassed the hurricane, Esther slowed and turned to the east - away from land and over much cooler waters.[3] It weakened to tropical storm status on September\u00a022,[2] and on that day the Weather Bureau discontinued advisories, remarking that Esther no longer had tropical characteristics.[1] As a weakened tropical storm, Esther turned to the southeast and gradually executed a large loop. On September\u00a024, it turned back to the west and subsequently turned back to the north,[2] influenced by another approaching trough. Warmer waters allowed the storm to re-intensify slightly.[3] As a result, the Boston Weather Bureau reissued advisories on the storm on September\u00a025 while Esther was 275\u00a0mi (443\u00a0km) south of Nantucket.[1] The storm crossed over eastern Cape Cod while gradually weakening,[2] making a final landfall near Rockland, Maine, on September\u00a026.[1] After crossing into Canada, Esther became extratropical early on September\u00a027 while continuing to the east-northeast. It was last noted at 06:00\u00a0UTC that day while over eastern Quebec.[2]"

Because of uncertainty about the storm's future path, the Weather Bureau advised residents along the east coast of the United States to closely follow the storm. The agency later issued a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia on September\u00a018.[1] In Norfolk, Virginia, between 10,000 and 15,000\u00a0people were evacuated to emergency shelters on September 19, but were able to return home the next day as Esther passed far to the east. Preparations for Esther were described by the National Weather Service's Norfolk bureau as \"the most thorough ever seen here\" at the time.[7] Naval ships and aircraft carriers based in the city headed for open waters to endure the storm, while over 200 military airplanes were flown inland away from the coast.[8] The National Weather Service, in anticipation of a possible landfall in the Carolinas, issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia on September 18 (tropical storm warnings were not issued at the time).[9] A hurricane warning was issued from Cherry Point, North Carolina to the Virginia capes on September 19, but was discontinued early on September 20 as the hurricane passed to the east. A hurricane watch was also issued from Cape May, New Jersey to the Massachusetts coast on September 19, and like the warning, was discontinued on September 20.[citation needed] As Esther began to parallel the coastline, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas from Long Island to Provincetown, Massachusetts on September 20, and were extended to Eastport, Maine early on September 21.[10] All hurricane watches were discontinued on September 21 as Esther moved away from the New England coast, and all hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings later that day as Esther passed near Nantucket and weakened to a tropical storm, and all warnings were discontinued on September 22 after the storm moved away from the coast.[11] After Esther completed its anticyclonic loop over the northwestern Atlantic, a gale warning was again issued from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Eastport, Maine on September 25, and was discontinued the next day after Esther made its second landfall in Maine.[12] Personnel on two offshore surveillance stations called the Texas Towers were evacuated; a third tower had collapsed during a storm in January 1961, prompting higher safety standards.[8]"

A storm surge of 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) was reported in Wilmington, North Carolina. The storm surge caused minor flooding and beach erosion in the Outer Banks,[7] where road damage was extensive.[13] Damage to property, however, was minimal, and the storm's effects in the Wilmington area were compared to those of \"a good nor'easter\" by the local weather bureau.[14] Southeastern Virginia experienced tides 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.6 to 1.2\u00a0m) above normal, which flooded some coastal highways in the Hampton Roads area.

Wind gusts to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) were observed at Ocean City, Maryland, and storm surge flooding caused damage to the city's sea wall and boardwalk. Minor to moderate damage was reported along the New Jersey coast.

Farther south on Long Island, the hardest hit areas were Nassau and eastern Suffolk counties. Wind gusts up to 108\u00a0mph (174\u00a0km/h) felled trees and power lines, leaving over 300,000\u00a0homes without electricity; minor structure damage was also reported.[15] Downed power lines and minor flooding due to rainfall amounts of up to 7\u00a0in (178\u00a0mm) also caused public transportation delays on Long Island.[1] Tides as high as 35\u00a0ft (10.7\u00a0m) damaged many pleasure boats.

There was also some loss to crops, especially apples and corn. Similar impact was reported farther east in Rhode Island, though winds were much stronger, with sustained winds of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) and a gust up to 83\u00a0mph (134\u00a0km/h) observed at Block Island. Tides ranging from 4 to 6\u00a0ft (1.2 to 1.8\u00a0m) above normal damaged small crafts and caused severe beach erosion, destroying a parking lot and washing out several roads. In south-central and northeastern Maine, precipitation totals between 2 and 4\u00a0in (51 and 102\u00a0mm) flooded basements, underpasses, and low-lying roads, resulting in traffic being delayed by detours.[15] Strong winds were also observed in eastern Massachusetts, with the strongest wind gust being 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) in Chatham.[15] Despite gale and storm force wind gusts in eastern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, damage was minimal and consisted mainly of downed trees and isolated power outages. Rainfall totals ranged from 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) in southern Maine to around 6 inches (152\u00a0mm) in the Boston area.[1] The storm separated Smith's Point from the rest of Nantucket Island, creating what came to be known as Esther's Island (which has since re-connected in 1988,[16] re-separated, and re-connected again in 2009).

The heavy seas brought by Esther made search-and-rescue efforts difficult. In the end, only three of the ten crewmen were rescued; the other seven were declared lost at sea.[17] The survivors told Coast Guard officials that during the storm, one of the engines of the plane failed, along with most of the electrical power; as a result, the crew was unable to drop the reserve tank or close the bomb bay doors automatically. Before the crew could close the bomb bay doors manually, the plane crashed in shark-infested waters and broke apart; three of the crewmen were able to get out of the downed plane, but the other seven were unable to escape.

This weakening was temporary, however, as the hurricane resumed strengthening shortly after.[2] The aircraft returned the next day to seed again, but the seeding canisters fell outside the eyewall with no effect on its structure, and the hurricane continued to strengthen. Despite this result, the experiment was deemed a success, and led to the establishment of Project Stormfury.[20]"

        "content": "A large, major, and deadly tornado outbreak occurred across the Central and Southern United States from May 6\u201310, 2024, as a result of a slow-moving trough that was moving across the country. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a tornado-driven high risk convective outlook for portions of central Oklahoma and extreme southern Kansas early on May 6. Millions of people were put under a particularly dangerous situation (PDS) tornado watch later that evening, as many tornadoes were reported across the region, particularly in Oklahoma, where a violent EF4 tornado struck the towns of Barnsdall and Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Severe and tornadic weather spread eastward over the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys over the next two days, with a nocturnal outbreak occurring in the latter on May 8, as tornadic supercell thunderstorms produced many tornadoes across the states of Tennessee, northern Alabama and western Georgia. The system responsible for the outbreak finally moved offshore by May 10 after producing several more tornadoes across the Southeast, including two EF2 tornadoes and hurricane-strength straight-line winds that moved through Tallahassee.[7] This large outbreak came less than two weeks after a similarly large and deadly outbreak occurred across most of the same regions. Five fatalities directly linked to the tornadoes were confirmed from the outbreak: two in Oklahoma on May 6, one in Tennessee on May 8, and two in Florida on May 10. Three non-tornadic deaths related to straight-line winds also occurred. In addition, during the outbreak, tornado emergencies were issued for three consecutive days between May 6\u20138 for damaging tornadoes; the last time that this phenomenon had occurred was exactly 21 years prior, when tornado emergencies were issued for four consecutive days between May 6\u20139, 2003, during a similarly large outbreak.[8] Overall, 179 tornadoes were confirmed from the outbreak, most of which were clustered around Oklahoma, Michigan, Tennessee, and Alabama, earning 51 points on the outbreak intensity score.[9]"

        "content": "Starting April 30, the Storm Prediction Center noted that certain models, including the ECMWF, forecasted a multi-day period of high instability and supportive wind shear across the Southern and Central Plains,[10] and by May 1, a 15% risk was added across Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and northern Texas.[11] On May 3, as confidence in a significant tornado outbreak increased, a 30% risk zone was introduced in far northern Oklahoma, central Kansas, and far southern Nebraska,[12] and on May 5, a moderate risk was issued as forecasters noted the possibility of strong and long-tracked tornadoes and large hail.[13] At 7:12\u00a0a.m. Central Daylight Time on May 6, a mesoscale discussion was issued concerning an upgrade to a tornado-driven high risk across central and north central Oklahoma and south central Kansas,[14] which was issued at the 1300Z outlook. A separate system also spawned severe thunderstorms in Tennessee, including one that produced an EF1 tornado that moved through Smithville.[15] At 1630Z, the Storm Prediction Center, noting severe activity in Tennessee as well as confidence in cells further south within Oklahoma, issued a new convective outlook, which expanded the high-risk area further south, the moderate risk further east, and added a marginal risk over the Tennessee Valley. This notably mentioned the presence of mixed-layer CAPE values between 2,500 and 4,500 j/kg across central and northern Oklahoma into southern Kansas, as severe activity was set to peak through the night,[16] and at 2\u00a0pm, a particularly dangerous situation tornado watch was issued, noting the probability of 2 or more tornadoes at >95%, and at least 1 significant tornado at 90%.[17] At 300Z, an observed sounding from the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma indicated an incredibly favorable environment for supercellular tornadoes, with mixed-layer CAPE values over 3,500 j/kg as well as strong wind shear and lapse rates, with a formulated Significant Tornado Parameter (STP) of 14.9.[18] One hour earlier, a powerful supercell spawned a violent tornado southeast of Hominy, Oklahoma. The tornado continued northeast, producing significant tree damage. As the tornado closed in on the city of Barnsdall, a tornado emergency was issued. The tornado inflicted EF4 damage to a well-constructed home south of Barnsdall and to a two-story home in the southeast side of the town; widespread EF3 damage occurred to other homes and a well-built, metal-framed building. Intense tree damage occurred in this area as well. At least one person was killed in the city. The tornado continued northeast and moved into Bartlesville, Oklahoma, where a Hampton Inn suffered severe damage. The tornado dissipated northeast of the town.[19] However, despite several supercells forming throughout the days, all the other tornadoes that occurred across the Plains were weak. A line of storms developed in southwestern Oklahoma that night, but most of them dissipated quickly without becoming severe and, as a result, areas in southern part of the high risk and further south did not see any storms. The only storm of the cluster to become severe tracked through the Oklahoma City metropolitan area producing intense straight-line winds and two weak EF1 tornadoes.[20]"

Later, another tornado prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency for Union City and Sherwood, the first tornado emergency ever issued in the state of Michigan. Other tornadoes were reported across Michigan along with Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania through the overnight hours into May 8.[23][24][25] Later on May 8, a wind and hail driven Moderate Risk was introduced, both at 45% hatched wind and hail risks,[26] more severe weather and tornadoes impacted much of the Middle Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. PDS tornado warnings were issued for tornadoes near Equality, Illinois and Aurora, Missouri.[27] Multiple strong supercells hit Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. At 6:54\u00a0pm CDT a tornado emergency was issued for parts of Marshall County, Maury County, Rutherford County, and Williamson County including Spring Hill, Tennessee, Chapel Hill, Tennessee, and Allisona, Tennessee of the Southern Nashville Metro area, a second in 5 months, after a Tornado Emergency in the north of the metro that hit Hendersonville on December 9, 2023.[28] In the middle of the outbreak, the SPC issued a 15% hatched tornado driven Moderate risk for Southeastern Tennessee, Northwestern Georgia and North Alabama at 0100 UTC.[29] Two flash flood emergencies were issued for parts of Northern Tennessee after round of torrential rainfall battered the area. Later, another supercell in Alabama caused a PDS tornado warning for the city of Huntsville, Alabama.[30] That same supercell went on to produce another damaging tornado that sparked a tornado emergency for Henagar, Alabama, Hammondville, Alabama, and Mentone, Alabama.[31]"

As the tornado approached SH-20, it intensified to low-end EF2 strength, damaging the roof of a home and destroying two outbuildings. Past this point, the tornado rapidly strengthened to low-end EF3 intensity as it knocked over seven steel power poles and snapped trees. After the tornado had crossed SH-20, it weakened. It traveled through primarily rural areas at EF2 strength, and then EF1 strength. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted, and outbuildings were damaged. At 9:39\u00a0p.m CDT (02:39 UTC), the National Weather Service in Tulsa, Oklahoma issued a Tornado Emergency for Barnsdall, after receiving reports of a large tornado and a large debris ball appearing on radar. As the tornado approached CR-2240, it regained EF2 strength and severe ground-scouring began. It then crossed Birch Lake, and further intensified to EF3 strength, continuing to destroy trees. As the tornado passed east of CR-2380, it became violent. It reached its peak intensity of EF4, with wind speeds estimated at 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h). A well-constructed home was swept clean off of its crawl space, and its debris was blown to the northeast. Nearby trees were completely stubbed and debarked, and vehicles were thrown and rolled. Continuing northeast, the tornado weakened slightly as it inflicted high-end EF3 damage to the NuCera Solutions wax plant on the southeast side of Barnsdall.[32] The tornado then continued moving into the east side of town, where numerous homes sustained severe damage. One manufactured home was completely destroyed, resulting in a fatality. Another frame-home was completely destroyed, with a nearby well-constructed garage being destroyed as well, both structures earning high-end EF3 ratings. The second fatality occurred in this residence. Along 2nd St, the tornado strengthened to EF4 intensity again, completely destroying a two-story home. Wind speeds here were estimated at 170\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h). Past there, the tornado crossed SH-123 where it severely damaged numerous homes and metal buildings and completely destroyed a manufactured home at EF2-EF3 strength.[33][34] This was the second time this part of Barnsdall had been hit by a tornado in 2024; an EF1 tornado had previously impacted the area on April 1.[35] Moving northeastward away from Barnsdall, the tornado weakened, but remained strong at EF1-EF2 strength as it caused significant tree damage, damaged homes, and destroyed outbuildings in more rural areas. The parent supercell also began to interact with a squall line that was coming from the west. The tornado then moved through the southern part of Bartlesville, where numerous homes and businesses suffered severe damage. The tornado then weakened to EF1 strength and crossed US 60 and US 75 east of Bartlesville, where it severely damaged a Hampton Inn there. The concrete walls of the hotel were speared with 2x4s as well. The nearby Gan's Mall had its newly-installed roof thrown across the road, which ended up trapping several people inside the Hampton Inn.[36] The tornado then exited the town as the parent supercell became absorbed into the trailing squall line, which caused the tornado to dissipate northeast of the town near Dewey at 10:07\u00a0pm. CDT (03:07 UTC). The tornado was on the ground for approximately 55 minutes, traveling a total length of 40.81 miles (65.68\u00a0km), reaching a peak width of 1,700 yards (1,600\u00a0m) at times. Along with the two fatalities, 33 other people were injured and the tornado caused $25 million in damage.[33][34][37][38][39]"

CDT (22:37 UTC) on Lofton Road just east of the Duck River in the eastern part of Columbia in Maury County, causing light tree damage with some limbs being broken. Strengthening ensued as it moved northeast, damaging some homes and collapsing roofs on some residences before snapping tree trunks near Mt Oliver Road at EF1 intensity.[15] The tornado then moved northwest of Beech Grove, damaging more houses and collapsing roofs and ripping roof panels off of homes at EF1 intensity. More tree trunks were snapped as it moved through forested regions and across US 412/SR 99, before the tornado reached EF2 strength along Old Highway 99. EF2 damage was observed further northeast, including an outbuilding that was totally destroyed by the tornado, with walls collapsed inward. Continuing onward, the tornado then intensified to its peak of low-end EF3 intensity as it moved into the Lasea community. It bent and collapsed large transmission power trusses, mostly destroyed two homes, which were left with only their interior rooms standing, and obliterating a mobile home. One person was killed in one of the destroyed homes.[15][40] EF2 damage was noted nearby further north where two houses had their roofs and walls destroyed. By this time, a tornado emergency had been issued for the eastern portions of Columbia as a debris ball was evident on radar and storm spotters reported a large, significant tornado on the ground. The tornado then weakened some to EF2 intensity as it approached and then crossed I-65, damaging nearby houses as well. The tornado also turned in a more easterly direction at this point as well as it snapped numerous tree trunks at Joe Brown Road.[15] The tornado then moved through mostly open areas before re-intensifying to high-end EF2 strength as it ripped and collapsed more roofs of houses and destroying a nearby barn. A carport was also destroyed, and metal power poles were bent. Approaching and then passing through the small town of Rally Hill, the tornado weakened, but still caused low-end EF2 damage in the community. A house that was under construction as well an outbuilding were destroyed, another home and outbuilding were damaged, and trees and power poles were snapped. The tornado then began a rapid weakening trend after crossing US 431 and wobbling southeastward slightly, snapping trees at EF1 intensity. The tornado then turned eastward and entered Marshall County at EF0 strength, uprooting trees and causing minor roof damage to an outbuilding before dissipating at 6:07\u00a0pm. CDT (23:07 UTC) southwest of Lunns Store.[40] This tornado was on the ground for 30 minutes, traveling a total length of 12.94 miles (20.82\u00a0km) and reaching a peak width of 900 yards (820\u00a0m). One person died as a result of the tornado, and 12 others were injured and the tornado caused $10 million in damage.[40][41]"

It moved east-southeastward at EF1 strength, snapping trees and inflicting minor roof damage to farm building. Another EF1 tornado would pass through this area about seven hours later, causing additional damage. This tornado then intensified and widened significantly as it reached County Road 422, overturning a camper, partially destroying a well-built home, destroying a horse trailer and a mobile home, and removing a third of the roof from a hay barn. Debris was thrown into the field across the street and 2x4s were impaled 1\u20131.5 feet (0.30\u20130.46\u00a0m) into the ground. Two people were injured in the camper. Along SR 40, several large 100+-year-old oak trees with diameters of 4\u20135 feet (1.2\u20131.5\u00a0m) were knocked down, including some that fell on knocked down two exterior walls of a home, which also had its windows sucked out. The tornado then reached its widest point and ripped a garage clean from the home it was attached to with the resulting debris shearing the home. This home was anchored with nails instead of bolts and a high-end EF2 rating was applied to this structure. Just beyond this point, the tornado reached its peak intensity of low-end EF3 along County Road 125. A well-built and well-anchored metal shop building was completely destroyed with the large bolts and plates that anchored the H-beams being snapped and bent. A large 4\u20135-foot (1.2\u20131.5\u00a0m) section of the foundation was ripped from the ground with debris being scattered about 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m), although the column anchoring remained intact. A nearby 20,000\u00a0lb (9,100\u00a0kg) 18-wheeler cab was tossed more than 150 yards (140\u00a0m) into a field across CR 125. Other nearby semi-trailers were shifted 50\u2013100 feet (15\u201330\u00a0m) as well.[42][15] Around this time, a tornado emergency was issued for Henagar, Hammondville, and Mentone.[43] The tornado then weakened to EF1 strength, snapping and uprooting trees and destroying outbuildings. Along SR 75 south of Henagar, a large outbuilding was unroofed, a smaller one was completely shifted off its foundation, another camper was overturned, power poles were snapped, and trees were snapped or uprooted. Between SR 75 and SR 40, the tornado turned eastward and briefly reached high-end EF2 intensity again, obliterating a mobile home, heavily damaging an outbuilding, and snapping and uprooting trees. The tornado then moved along SR 40 at EF1 intensity, peeling back tin on several chicken houses, including one that collapsed, snapped or uprooted more trees, and damaged the roofs of homes. After damaging another mobile home, the tornado steadily weakened causing only sporadic outbuilding and tree damage before dissipating as it crossed SR 117 just before reaching the city limits of Hammondville and I-59 at 11:24\u00a0pm CDT (04:24 UTC). The tornado traveled 12.34 miles (19.86\u00a0km) and reached a peak width of 0.5 miles (0.80\u00a0km). Seven people were injured.[42][15][44]"

After damaging an old farm building, the tornado tracked east-southeastward at EF1 intensity snapping or uprooting numerous trees as it passed just south of Midway through rural areas. The tornado then crossed the Ochlockonee River into Leon County, continuing to cause EF1 tree damage as it passed through Ochlockonee as it tracked along US 90. A mobile home park had extensive tree damage, with several trees falling on mobile homes. The tornado then entered the western city limits of Tallahassee near the intersection of US 90 and SR 263 and turned southeastward, causing roof and siding damage to a hotel and shopping center. After crossing SR 263, the tornado intensified to low-end EF2 strength as it approached and crossed SR 20. A swath of pine trees was snapped at about 75 feet (23\u00a0m) above the ground and an automotive repair building was heavily damaged. After inflicting significant EF1 tree damage on the Lively Technical College and Tallahassee Community College campuses, the tornado briefly reached low-end EF2 intensity again as it passed over a neighborhood, where another area of intense tree damage was noted with numerous homes damaged by fallen trees. The tornado then began to move through densely populated areas, causing widespread EF1 tree damage through several neighborhoods. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged by fallen trees, especially along SR 366. The tornado then moved through the southwestern part of the Florida State University campus, continuing to down numerous trees. The tent housing the FSU Flying High Circus was destroyed and the outfield fence at Dick Howser Stadium was severely damaged. Turning back to an east-southeastward heading and moving into Downtown Tallahassee along Gaines Street, the tornado collapsed a construction crane and inflicted major damage to businesses. Multiple warehouses in Railroad Square suffered severe damage and the railroad depot sustained roof damage. The tornado then began to interact with another EF2 tornado that was ongoing to its south causing this tornado to turn back to the southeast. It missed the Florida State Capitol to the south, continuing to snap trees in residential areas, parks, and a country club and blowing down street signs before rapidly weakening and dissipating at 7:03\u00a0am. EDT as the other EF2 tornado to its south became the dominant circulation. The storm that caused this tornado, as well as the one that overtook it, was responsible for an area of wind gusts potentially exceeding 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) in southern Tallahassee.[15][45] This tornado traveled 19.58 miles (31.51\u00a0km) and reached a peak width of 900 yards (820\u00a0m), causing $92 million in damage.[46][47]"

It was the third of three simultaneous tornadoes in Leon County as an EF1 tornado was already ongoing to the south of this tornado. Along the beginning of its path, the tornado snapped numerous trees and a power pole at EF1 intensity as it moved east-southeastward. As it reached SR 20, the tornado made a sharp turn and began moving due east along the highway continuing to snap numerous trees as it moved through the Lake Talquin State Recreational Area. The tornado then veered back to the east-southeast away from SR 20 and impacted many subdivisions in the Norfleet neighborhood, leaving behind a large area of snapped trees. Turning back eastward and moving into the southern part of Tallahassee, the tornado crossed SR 263, continuing to snap dozens of trees along with wooden power poles. The tornado then began to move generally eastward through neighborhoods in the southwest part of the city, snapping and uprooting countless trees, snapping power poles, damaging an elementary school, and inflicting roof damage to homes, outbuildings, and other structures. Some homes were damaged by fallen trees as well. Around this time, a swath of damaging 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) straight-line winds developed just south of this tornado. This area of destructive winds would continue to parallel this tornado until it dissipated. The tornado then moved through the Florida A&M University campus producing widespread EF1 tree damage with two university buildings also being damaged. Power poles and lines were taken down by fallen trees as well. The tornado reached its peak width in this area and a much larger area of EF0 shingle damage to homes and businesses was noted as it crossed SR 363. The first Tallahassee tornado then merged with this tornado as it moved over the Capital City Country Club, and this tornado became the dominant tornadic circulation as it continued through Tallahassee. After leaving the golf course, the tornado reached low-end EF2 intensity as it impacted the Indian Head Acres subdivisions, snapping trees at about 75 feet (23\u00a0m) above the ground. Fallen trees also damaged homes, power poles, and power lines. The tornado continued eastward, causing EF1 tree damage throughout several subdivisions as it crossed US 319 and exited Tallahassee. After crossing CR 2195 east of Tallahassee, the tornado weakened to EF0 intensity uprooting a few trees along US 27 as it crossed into Jefferson County before dissipating at 7:14\u00a0am EDT.[15][45] Along its 24-minute journey, the tornado traveled 27.22\u00a0mi (43.81\u00a0km) and reached a peak width of 1,400\u00a0yd (1,300\u00a0m).

Hellen formed on March\u00a026 in the northern portion of the channel, and the storm brought rainfall to coastal Mozambique while in its formative stages. While moving southeastward, it developed an organized area of convection over the center of circulation. Warm waters allowed Hellen to rapidly intensify while passing south of the Comoros, with a well-defined eye forming in the middle of the thunderstorms. The cyclone attained peak intensity March\u00a030, with maximum sustained winds estimated 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in La R\u00e9union. Subsequently, Hellen weakened quickly due to dry air and land interaction with Madagascar, and the storm's eye dissipated. On March\u00a031, the storm made landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a weakened cyclone, despite previous forecasts for the center to remain over water. By April\u00a01, Hellen was no longer a tropical cyclone after most of the convection dissipated. The remnants turned to the west, moving over Mozambique without redeveloping, later dissipating on April\u00a05. Early in its existence, Hellen's rainfall in Mozambique destroyed hundreds of houses and a bridge. Flooding killed four people in the country, three of whom due to a home collapsing. Later, the cyclone passed south of the Comoros islands, causing flooding due to high storm surge and waves that killed one person. The storm forced 8,956\u00a0people to evacuate their homes due to the threat for landslides, while 901\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed. On nearby Mayotte, high rainfall flooded rivers, sweeping one car away. In northwestern Madagascar, Hellen damaged or destroyed 611\u00a0houses, leaving 1,736\u00a0people homeless. The storm killed three people after capsizing a boat."

        "content": "On March\u00a025, 2014, a weak area of low pressure accompanied by broad, flaring convection became increasingly organized over Mozambique. Owing to favorable environmental conditions, featuring low wind shear, vorticity became more enhanced and symmetrical.[2] A compact system, the low steadily organized as it emerged over the Mozambique Channel on March\u00a026. Though continued land interaction initially hindered development,[3] enhanced outflow supported convective development as it straddled the Mozambique\u2013Tanzania border. With high sea surface temperatures in the storm's track, the JTWC anticipated further organization and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 2000\u00a0UTC on March\u00a026.[4] Once further offshore on March\u00a027, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in La R\u00e9union classified the system as Disturbance 14.[5] Drifting slowly eastward, a prominent feeder band developed along the system's eastern side; however, this band disrupted low-level inflow of warm, moist air, and suppressed convection over the circulation center.[6] Though convection later began to consolidate into a small central dense overcast (CDO) feature by March\u00a028, continued disruption of the low-level inflow prevented much development. M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France noted that despite forecasting the storm to peak as a moderate tropical storm, with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph), there was potential for rapid intensification due to the storm's small size.[7] Conversely, the JTWC noted that proximity to land and dry mid-level air, represented by surface outflow boundaries, could hamper significant development. Once further over the Mozambique Channel, the system became increasingly organized and the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 21S.[8] M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France followed suit at 0000\u00a0UTC on March\u00a029 and classified the cyclone as a moderate tropical storm, with the tropical cyclone warning center in Madagascar assigning the name Hellen.[9] Hellen soon assumed an east-southeast track toward Madagascar, as a ridge established itself to the northeast. Throughout March\u00a029, the storm became increasingly organized with an eye apparent on microwave satellite imagery.[10] Rapid to explosive intensification ensued during the later half of March\u00a029 into March\u00a030 at a rate M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France later referred to as \"astounding\".[11] Deep convective banding wrapped around a ragged eye,[12] which soon contracted to \"pinhole\" size.[13] This prompted M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France to upgrade Hellen to a tropical cyclone with winds estimated at 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) at 0000\u00a0UTC on March\u00a030.[1] Six hours later, they further upgraded the storm to an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph).[11] Hellen attained its peak intensity between 1100 and 1500\u00a0UTC as a very intense tropical cyclone, with winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), gusts reaching 325\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph), and a barometric pressure of 915\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.02\u00a0inHg).[1] This ranked it as one of the most powerful storms over the Mozambique Channel on record.[14] The storm featured a 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) wide eye embedded within a symmetrical and intense CDO, spanning 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) across.[15] The JTWC estimated Hellen to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), making it a high-end Category\u00a04-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, although this was lowered to 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) in reanalysis.[16] After peak intensity, the cyclone's eye soon began to fill and cool as weakening ensued. Defying previous forecasts, Hellen continued on a southeasterly track toward Madagascar and the likelihood of it making landfall became apparent.[14] By the end of March\u00a030, Hellen's eye had collapsed and disappeared from satellite imagery,[17] as the combination of dry air and land interaction took their toll on the storm.[18] At about 0800\u00a0UTC on March\u00a031, Hellen made landfall on Mitsinjo with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), and the previously unfavorable conditions coupled with land interaction to induce rapid weakening.[19] The ridge to the east turned Hellen to a southwest drift over land. By early on April\u00a01, the convection largely dissipated as the center became difficult to locate, with peak winds dropping to 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph). As a result, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France discontinued advisories that day,[20] as did the JTWC.[21] The remnants moved back over open waters, but were not expected to reorganize due to the poor nature of the convection.[22] As the low continued to the west, the convection increased on April\u00a04 while approaching the coastline of Mozambique,[23] although the system failed to redevelop before moving onshore.[24]"

The Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport in Moroni on Grande Comore was closed for about 24\u00a0hours due to the storm. Also on the island, a road was damaged, and one house was flooded.[29] Shortly after the storm, workers began repairing roads and distributing aid.[30] Though the center of Cyclone Hellen remained south of Mayotte, it prompted an \"orange alert\" on March\u00a030 for the area due to the potential for hurricane-force gusts.[31] The storm's rapid intensification caught most residents on the island off-guard, with widespread disruptions to traffic and electricity taking place. Wind gusts up to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) downed trees and power lines, blocking off roads while heavy rains caused significant flooding.[32] A peak 24\u2011hour rainfall of 239\u00a0mm (9.4\u00a0in) was measured in Mtsamboro between March\u00a029 and 30.[33] In M'Tsangamouji, cars were swept away by a swollen river.

        "content": " Intense Tropical Cyclone Amara was a tropical cyclone that brought stormy conditions to Rodrigues in December\u00a02013. Amara was the first named storm in the southwest Indian Ocean during the later half of 2013, and developed from a disturbance within the monsoon trough on December\u00a015. The following day, the system attained tropical depression status. Despite its ill-defined organization, the depression was able to continue strengthening, reaching moderate tropical storm status on December\u00a016 as it tracked southwest. Situated in a favorable atmospheric environment, a period of rapid intensification ensued after Amara reached tropical cyclone status on December\u00a018. After fluctuating in strength, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.61\u00a0inHg) on December\u00a021,[nb 1] making it an intense tropical cyclone based on the intensity scale utilized by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France. Shortly after, wind shear increased as Amara tracked southeast, resulting in a weakening phase. The shearing effects caused the cyclone to rapidly decay, and by December\u00a023, Amara degenerated into a remnant low. Amara was initially expected to track directly over the island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class\u00a04 warning\u00a0\u2013 denoting a warning of highest urgency\u00a0\u2013 by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed to the east of the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely affect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outages cut power to 12,000\u00a0homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origin of Amara can be traced back to an area of low pressure embedded within a monsoon trough southeast of Diego Garcia on December\u00a013, 2013. Computer models suggested that surrounding atmospheric conditions would later become more conducive for tropical cyclogenesis.[2] Over the course of the day, the localized area of circulation remained sheared, though convection remained persistent.[3] Despite the hindering atmospheric environment, the system organized faster than anticipated, and was classified as a tropical disturbance by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France at 1200\u00a0UTC on December\u00a014.[4] Shortly after development, the disturbance underwent a reformation phase and consequently a new center of circulation developed, allowing the system to reach tropical depression status early on December\u00a015.[5] Nonetheless, the storm's overall structure remained ill-defined due to the presence of wind shear and multiple mesovortices.[6] At 1330\u00a0UTC on December\u00a016, the Mauritius Meteorological Services designated the system as a moderate tropical storm, thus assigning it the name Amara. At the time the storm had a minimum barometric pressure estimated at 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.39\u00a0inHg).[7] During the subsequent hours, the storm began to slowly track west-southwest under the periphery of a nearby subtropical ridge. Amara's circulation center consolidated and rainbands became more tightly wrapped around the center, at which time the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) began to monitor the system.[8] Late on December\u00a017, Amara began to develop an eye, observable via microwave imagery.[9] Based on the antecedent developments, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France upgraded the system to severe tropical storm intensity at 0000\u00a0UTC the following day.[10] Nine hours later, the JTWC upgraded Amara to tropical cyclone intensity,[11] with M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France following suit three hours later.[12] Situated in a location with low vertical wind shear and outspread outflow, Amara was forecast to continue strengthening, though at the same time the cyclone was expected to move very slowly due to its interaction with weak steering currents in between two subtropical ridges.[11] Rapid intensification ensued throughout the latter hours of December\u00a018, coinciding with the development of a ragged eye feature within the tropical cyclone on infrared imagery.[13] M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France upgraded Amara to intense tropical cyclone status at 0000\u00a0UTC on December\u00a019. By this time the storm's central pressure had fallen to 944\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.88\u00a0inHg).[14] Shortly after, however, Amara's once well-defined outflow pattern became suppressed, resulting in a slight weakening and a downgrade from intense tropical cyclone status just twelve hours later.[15][16] This weakening phase was brief, and shortly thereafter Amara was reclassified as an intense tropical cyclone on December\u00a021.[17] At 0600\u00a0UTC that day, Amara reached its peak intensity as an intense tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 933\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.55\u00a0inHg).[18] Following peak intensity, an approaching upper-level, mid-latitude trough increased wind shear and forced the storm towards the southeast, resulting in the cyclone weakening.[19] By 0600\u00a0UTC the next day, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France determined that Amara had weakened below intense tropical cyclone status.[20] The strong wind shear continued to take its toll on the cyclone, stripping away and exposing Amara's low-level circulation center away from the rest of its associated convection.[21] At 1200\u00a0UTC on December\u00a022, Amara weakened to severe tropical storm intensity,[22] and was later downgraded further to tropical depression intensity the following day. Amara's downgrade to such an intensity marked the cessation of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's tropical cyclone bulletins.[23] The remnant vortex associated with Amara continued to persist over the next few days and curved westward, though it lacked persistent convection.[24] The remnant circulation gradually became increasingly diffused and was last noted by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France at 1200\u00a0UTC on December\u00a028.[25]"

These initial winds uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, resulting in power outages.[35] At the height of power outages, over 12,000\u00a0households were without power, primarily in Port Sud-Est, Mount Lubin, and Rivi\u00e8re-Cocos.[30] By the afternoon of December\u00a022, only 20%\u00a0of homes had access to electricity.[36] Some of the fallen trees rendered roads impassable.[37] Heavy rains caused some creeks to overflow their banks, and riffles became impassable.[38] The rainfall also caused extensive soil erosion.[39] Amara also triggered a strong storm surge, resulting in coastal flooding.[40] Despite the heavy rainfall, total precipitation amounts remained relatively low, peaking at 78\u00a0mm (3.07\u00a0in) in Citronelle.[41] On December\u00a021, a wind gust of 152\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph) was reported in the locality of Pointe Canon, which was the highest wind measurement recorded in associated with Amara.[34] Another station at Sir Ga\u00ebtan Duval Airport reported a similarly strong wind gust clocked at 135\u00a0km/h (84\u00a0mph).[42] The strong winds tore metal sheets off of buildings and cut telecommunications between Rodrigues and the rest of the world.[43] Despite the widespread precautionary measures taken beforehand,[33] Port Mathurin suffered marginal impacts.[40] Following the storm, local police groups and the Special Mobile Force were mobilized in order to assist in relief efforts.[37] Technicians from the Mauritius Central Electricity Board were dispatched to resolve power issues.[36]"

It originated off the Pacific coast of Mexico and became an intense hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of at least 136 miles per hour (219\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The hurricane made landfall just south of Mazatl\u00e1n on October\u00a09, becoming the strongest on record to strike the city. An observatory in the city recorded a minimum pressure of 958.6 millibars (28.31\u00a0inHg). The hurricane severely damaged a 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) portion of western Mexico, from Nayarit to Sinaloa. In Mazatl\u00e1n, the communications severed due to the strong winds, and the city briefly relied on a single Pan Am plane that was carrying American filmmaker Walt Disney.  The hurricane killed at least 100\u00a0people and left over 1,000 homeless. Total damage was estimated at $4.5\u00a0million (1943\u00a0USD)."

A small coastal boat arrived in the port of Mazatl\u00e1n after the storm and reported six crew members missing.[1] The hurricane destroyed about 60% of the buildings in Mazatl\u00e1n, including 3,000\u00a0homes, with thousands left homeless in the city.[26][27][28] The storm also caused severe damage in nearby Villa Uni\u00f3n, with damage estimated at US$4.5\u00a0million. The hurricane killed at least 100\u00a0people.[1] Shortly before the peak of the hurricane, Pan Am grounded all of their airlines. A plane from Los Angeles landed in Mazatl\u00e1n and rode out the storm, with 21\u00a0passengers onboard. The passengers included filmmaker Walt Disney, his family, and employees, who were headed to Mexico City for production on The Three Caballeros. After the storm, the plane was the only means of communicating with the rest of the world for about 18\u00a0hours, after the airport's radio towers were damaged. The storm also damaged all telephone or telegraph lines in the city, while also damaging the airport's hangar and administration building.[24][25][29] Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the storm overflowed rivers and destroyed warehouses, ruining most of the crops in the state.[30] The hurricane caused severe damage along a 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) portion of the Mexican coastline, from Acaponeta, Nayarit northward to Mazatl\u00e1n.[25] In Guadalajara, the hurricane tore the roofs of houses while also causing flooding.

The first tropical cyclone of the season, Anita developed from a tropical wave on August 29 in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. It tracked westward into an area with conditions favorable for further development, and quickly intensified into a hurricane by late on August 30. Initially, Anita was forecast to strike Texas, though a building ridge turned it to the west-southwest. The hurricane rapidly strengthened to attain peak winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h), and on September 2 Anita made landfall in eastern Tamaulipas as a Category 5 hurricane. It quickly weakened as it crossed Mexico, and after briefly redeveloping into a tropical depression in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Anita dissipated on September 4 to the south of the Baja California Peninsula. Anita was the first major hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Ethel of 1960. The hurricane produced light rainfall and high tides along the Gulf Coast of the United States. Some low-level flooding was reported, but damage was slight. In Mexico, the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall. The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico, with about 25,000 people left homeless. The rainfall, reaching over 17.52\u00a0inches (445\u00a0mm), caused flooding and mudslides which killed eleven people in Tamaulipas."

The wave axis tracked steadily westward, and on August 23 convection increased after the wave passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. By August 27, the wave axis was located over Cuba, with the area of convection located between Florida and the Bahamas after tracking northwestward. The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5\u00a0mph (7\u00a0km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230\u00a0miles (370\u00a0km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana.[1] With a ridge of high pressure to its north, the depression tracked westward. Favorable conditions persisted for several days prior to the arrival of the depression, and as such the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Anita. The storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures, and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm, moist tropical air; Anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on August 30;[1] this is the latest date for the first hurricane since 1967.[2] Initially it threatened to strike Texas, though building high pressures to the north of the hurricane turned Anita to the west-southwest. The hurricane developed a well-defined eye, and Anita began to rapidly intensify late on September 1 after attaining major hurricane status. During a two-day period up to its peak intensity, Anita deepened at a rate of 2\u00a0mbar per hour, and on September 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h) while located just offshore northeastern Mexico, making Anita a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.[1] Hurricane Anita maintained its strength as it approached land, and at 1100\u00a0UTC on September 2 it made landfall on Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas, about 145\u00a0miles (235\u00a0km) south of Brownsville, Texas or 80\u00a0miles (130\u00a0km) north of Tampico, Mexico. Moving ashore with a pressure of 926\u00a0mbar, Anita was the third most intense tropical cyclone to strike the nation, and was the most intense hurricane to hit from the Gulf of Mexico.[2][3] It rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, and on September 3, about 25\u00a0hours after moving ashore, Anita emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression. Reclassified as Tropical Depression Eleven, the system continued to the west, and weakened further after encountering cooler water temperatures. The depression gradually lost its deep convection, and on September 4 it dissipated off of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.[4]"

The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along the northern Gulf Coast to remain at port.[5] Initially, Anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the Texas/Louisiana border. As a result, schools in Cameron Parish, Louisiana were closed,[6] and on August 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas coastlines. After the track shifted further to the south, the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between Brownsville and just south of Corpus Christi, Texas.[1] An emergency shelter was opened in Brownwood, Texas, and Army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations.[7] An official from the National Weather Service recommended evacuation for all residents east of Galveston, Texas living in an area below 5\u00a0feet (1.5\u00a0m) above sea level; about 20,000 left Cameron, Louisiana.[8] In all, about 58,000\u00a0people evacuated coastal locations in Louisiana and Texas.[1] Though the National Hurricane Center did not issue hurricane warnings for Mexico, officials warned the Mexican government of the potential danger of the hurricane. Across the northeastern coastline of the country, 35,000\u00a0people evacuated prior to the arrival of the hurricane,[1] including all of the residents in the village where the hurricane struck.[9] The Mexican army assisted in evacuations and preparing emergency shelters.[10]"

The tenth named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Wukong developed out of a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On August\u00a013, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the depression as a tropical storm. The storm traveled along a curving path south of Japan, absorbing the remnants of Tropical Storm Sonamu on August\u00a015 before turning towards the west. Wukong made landfall at peak intensity late on August\u00a017 near Miyazaki City in southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b. The cyclone remained over land for about 24\u00a0hours before moving out over the Sea of Japan. The storm weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating on August\u00a021. Due to the slow movement of the storm, it produced heavy rains, peaking at 516\u00a0mm (20.3\u00a0in). Two people were killed due to rough seas produced by the storm and three others were injured."

        "content": "On August\u00a012, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring a tropical depression located to the south of Chichi-jima island.[1] The depression formed within a monsoonal gyre which also spawned Tropical Storm Sonamu.[2] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 11W several hours after the JMA[3] while the system was located about 140\u00a0km (85\u00a0mi) south of Iwo Jima.[2] The depression gradually strengthened as it moved towards the northwest. Early on August\u00a013, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Wukong;[1] a name which was contributed by China. The names means \"the king of the monkeys\" and was featured in the novel Journey to the West.[2] The storm slowed significantly[1] as a ridge built eastward over Japan.[2] On August\u00a014, Wukong turned towards the northeast and reached its peak intensity with winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph 10-minute winds) as a severe tropical storm.[1] At the same time, the JTWC assessed Wukong to have reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph 1-minute winds).[3] The next day, the storm began to accelerate due to an interaction with the nearby Tropical Storm Sonamu. Wukong absorbed the weakening Sonamu later in the day[2] before turning towards the west.[1] On August\u00a016, the storm turned towards the northwest due to a weakness in the ridge near Japan.[2] Wukong made landfall late on August\u00a017[1] near Miyazaki City in southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b.[2] As the storm made landfall, the JTWC assessed Wukong to have winds of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph 1-minute winds).[3] The cyclone slowly traveled across land, entering the Sea of Japan about 24\u00a0hours after landfall.[2] Several hours after entering the Sea of Japan, the JMA downgraded Wukong to a tropical depression. The depression persisted for two more days before dissipating near the Russian coastline.[1]"

The two largest air carriers in Japan, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, cancelled at least 36 domestic flights ahead of the storm. Several of the largest oil refineries halted oil product shipments from three refineries. Kyushu Railways postponed services on five lines, one of which crossed the entire prefecture. Long distance ferries were also shut down.[4] Iwakuni, Yamaguchi was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 3 and Sasebo, Nagasaki was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Storm Watch.[5] Wukong produced torrential rains over Japan, peaking at 516\u00a0mm (20.3\u00a0in) in Hinokage, Miyazaki Prefecture. Flooding in Ky\u016bsh\u016b and the Yamaguchi Prefecture caused the evacuation of about 300 households.[6] At least 200 residences were left without power in Ky\u016bsh\u016b.[4] Two people were killed by rough seas produced by Wukong, and three others were injured in storm-related accidents.

The twelfth tropical cyclone and eleventh named storm of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, it originated from a tropical wave which entered the tropical Atlantic on September 14. The wave quickly organized as it neared the Windward Islands on September 20, becoming a tropical depression just two days later. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Karen later that day, as it moved across the southern Windward Islands. By 18:00 UTC that day, Karen had reached its first peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,003 millibars (29.6\u00a0inHg). Karen weakened back to a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September 23. However, just 12 hours later, Karen re-intensified into a tropical storm. It then entered the central Atlantic, early the next day. Karen began to degrade on September 27, when it weakened into a tropical depression, due to strong wind shear. The system subsequently degenerated into a surface trough later that day.[1] Karen caused significant flooding and widespread power outages in Trinidad and Tobago. Damage on the island of Tobago reached $3.53 million (USD). Flooding and power outages also occurred in Puerto Rico where roughly 29,000 customers lost electricity. Only minimal impacts were reported in Venezuela, the remainder of the Windward Islands, and the British Virgin Islands."

The wave was accompanied by a large area of convection, or showers and thunderstorms as it moved over the Cabo Verde Islands. However, convective activity started to become disorganized as the wave moved across the tropical Atlantic.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor the system for tropical cyclogenesis on September 18.[2] On September 20, convection began to blossom once more as the wave moved into an area favorable for development.[3] Early the next day, an area of low pressure formed along the wave axis while it was located roughly 575 miles (925\u00a0km) east-southeast of the southern Windward Islands. At 00:00 UTC on September 22, the wave organized into a tropical depression while located 115 miles (185\u00a0km) east of Tobago. At this time, the system was being steered to the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge.[1] Just three hours later, the depression organized into Tropical Storm Karen while located roughly 120 miles (190\u00a0km) southeast of St. Vincent.[4] At around 12:00 UTC that day, Karen passed through the Windward Islands just north of Tobago.[5] Early on September 23, Karen's convective pattern started to become disorganized as it moved into an area of strong northeasterly vertical wind shear and dry air. At 6:00 UTC on September 24, Karen weakened into a tropical depression as it shifted to the northeast.[1] Early on September 25, deep convection began to slowly increase, however, thunderstorm activity remained south of the center due to north-northeasterly wind shear.[6] Although just a few hours later, thunderstorm activity began to flourish over the storm's center.[1] At 6:00 UTC that day, Karen re-attained tropical storm status while located roughly 90 miles (140\u00a0km) southwest of St. Croix.[7] Karen began to slow its forward movement and shift northward around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge.[1] By 18:00 UTC, the storm's center reformed slightly to the west.[8] At 0:00 UTC on September 25, the storm reached its initial peak intensity with one-minute sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1,003\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg), as it moved over the islands of Culebra and Vieques.[9] Later that day, Karen entered the central Atlantic.[1] On September 26, convection developed over Karen's center. At 9:00 UTC that day, the storm reached its second peak intensity with winds of around 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,004\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg).[1][10] However, later that day, Karen's circulation became elongated, and weakening occurred early on September 27.[11][12] A few hours later, the NHC noted that the storm's circulation had attached to a surface boundary that extended from the remnants of Hurricane Jerry.[13] At 12:00 UTC on September 27, Karen degraded into a tropical depression.[1] Just nine hours later, the system degenerated into a surface trough while located roughly 425 miles (684\u00a0km) east-southeast of Bermuda.[14]"

Caribbean Airlines cancelled numerous flights in the country.[18] Residents of the country were asked to avoid floodwaters for health and safety reasons.[19] Heavy rainfall caused flash flooding across Trinidad and Tobago. Severe flooding was reported in southwestern Tobago and Scarborough. In Trinidad, the Sandy River overtopped its bank, causing flooding in Mason Hall. Nearby, a mudslide caused a road to shut down and a house was destroyed. In Plymouth, seven boats sank after Jetty was damaged.[20][21] In Mt.

On November 12, a tropical depression formed about 175 miles (282\u00a0km) north of Panama. It moved northwestward, slowly organizing and becoming a tropical storm on November\u00a014. Receiving the name Laura, the storm continued to intensify as it turned northward toward western Cuba; late on November\u00a015, it attained peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[1] Originally, the National Hurricane Center anticipated Laura would attain hurricane status,[2] as well as for it to continue northward into the Gulf of Mexico. Although a cold front was expected to bring the storm to the north, a ridge instead increased over the southeastern United States, which prevented Laura from moving ashore.[1] Tropical Storm Laura maintained peak winds for about 48\u00a0hours, during which a minimum pressure of 994 hectopascals (29.4\u00a0inHg) was recorded. Steering currents were initially weak, which caused the storm to drift toward the northeast, before the ridge to its north forced the storm to the southwest; by late on November\u00a017, Laura finished executing a clockwise loop.[1] Its path to the southwest away from Cuba was unusual; only two other storms on record \u2013 a hurricane in 1888 and Hurricane Ike in 2008 \u2013 had a southward element in their path when they affected Cuba, and each struck the northern coast of the country.[3] Laura weakened as it turned westward and later to the south and southwest. After the winds decreased to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), however, the storm began re-intensifying as it approached Central America. Late on November\u00a020, Laura again reached peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), which was maintained for 30\u00a0hours until the storm made landfall in Punta Gorda, Belize. Early on November\u00a022, the system dissipated over central Guatemala.[1]"

Due to the flooding, officials forced 26,000\u00a0people from their homes in Pinar del R\u00edo, and one person in that province drowned while crossing a river.[7] The storm's passage was believed to have diverted a flock of great black-backed gulls toward Central America and north-coastal South America; the species is usually found in the Mid-Atlantic states, and were migrating to the Gulf Coast or Cuba when they were affected by the storm.[8] When Laura's path was uncertain, forecasters advised fishermen to remain at port along the Yucatan Peninsula and southern Florida.[2] Gale warnings were also issued for the Florida Keys, due to the uncertainty.[5] No significant damage or casualties were reported in Central America,[1] although heavy rainfall was reported across the region.[9] On Glover's Reef off the coast of British Honduras (now Belize), the storm stranded a group of about 20\u00a0scientists affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution; the group was affected by the strong winds and rains, and required rescue.

The second named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on August\u00a014. The wave gradually developed, and the system was designated a tropical depression on August\u00a019. The depression began tracking towards the west-northwest, and became a tropical storm the next day. On August\u00a022, Bonnie was upgraded to a hurricane, with a well-defined eye. The storm peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and around the same time, the storm slowed and turned more towards the north-northwest. A large and powerful cyclone, Bonnie moved ashore in North Carolina early on August\u00a027, slowing as it turned northeast. After briefly losing hurricane status, the storm moved offshore and regained Category 1-force winds, although it weakened again on entering cooler waters. Fearing a major hurricane strike, coastal locations from Florida to Virginia performed extensive preparations in advance of the storm. In addition to tropical cyclone watches and warnings, about 950,000\u00a0people were evacuated from the Carolinas, and the military evacuated and relocated hundreds of aircraft and vessels from the storm's projected path. Soldiers and guardsmen were deployed throughout those regions. Hurricane Bonnie made landfall as a borderline Category 2\u2013Category 3 storm, with intense wind gusts of up to 104\u00a0mph (167\u00a0km/h) and rainfall peaking at about 11\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm). Reports of downed trees and powerlines, as well as structural damage such as blown-out windows and torn-off roofs, were reported. In coastal North Carolina, the storm washed ashore tens of thousands of tires that had been part of an artificial reef. Crop damage was extensive, but the storm was overall less severe than initially feared. Total damage was estimated at $1\u00a0billion (1998 USD). At the time, it was the costliest Atlantic tropical cyclone to not have its name retired following the season, as Bonnie was used again in the 2004 season."

        "content": "On August\u00a014, 1998, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa just north of Dakar and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean. Initially located within cool waters, a strong high pressure area steered the disturbance on a west-southwest track over warmer waters, and convection started to develop. Several small centers of rotation existed within a broad circulation, and at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019, the centers consolidated and the disturbance became sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression. Despite being poorly organized, winds slightly to the north of the system's center approached tropical storm strength shortly thereafter.[1] Ship reports revealed a closed circulation, though the center was elongated in a northwest\u2013southeast oriented manner. Upper-level winds were favorable, which suggested that intensification was likely. The cyclone began moving on a northwestward track,[2] and just hours later the center of circulation appeared to reform close to the convection, an indication of a strengthening storm, as good outflow existed over the western side of the storm.[3] Deep convection slowly developed closer to the center,[4] and at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Bonnie as it continued its west-northwest track around the periphery of a high pressure system over the Leeward Islands.[1] Late on August\u00a020, the first reconnaissance plane entered the storm and found a minimum central barometric pressure of 1001 mb. The storm brushed the Leeward Islands, although the main thunderstorm activity remained to the north of the storm over the open ocean.[1]  Bonnie began to organize its broad circulation early on August\u00a021,[5] and within the next day the storm began to intensify. The storm began to look strong on satellite images with banding features over the north and west quadrants.[6] The Hurricane Hunters aircraft found a minimum pressure of 987 mb and a nearly complete eyewall early on August\u00a022, and as a result, the tropical storm was upgraded to hurricane status.[7] Bonnie slowed in forward speed, coinciding with previous forecasts.[8] Later that day, storm was upgraded to a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, which occurred with a substantial 15 mb drop in 8 hours. At the same time, steering currents weakened with the dissipation of the high pressure system; this, combined with the effect of a nearby trough, caused the storm to turn in a more north-northwestward direction around the western periphery of an anticyclone to the east.[9] Bonnie became a Category 3 storm, a major hurricane, at 1200\u00a0UTC the next day, reaching its peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) at the same time.[1] A mid- to upper-level trough slowed the storm almost to a halt early on August\u00a023,[10] before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) advisory then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing, bringing cooler water to the surface as a result of the slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial.[11] Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time.[12] Early on August\u00a025, the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane took its toll on Bonnie, giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.[13] The storm accelerated somewhat by August\u00a026, and early that day, it was moving at about 14\u00a0mph (23\u00a0km/h).[14] An approaching mid-level trough steered Bonnie north-northeast, and at 2100\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026, the eye passed east of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The hurricane once again slowed, and early the next day, it made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina as a strong Category 2 hurricane.[1] Doppler weather radar displays estimated that maximum sustained winds had quickly weakened to below hurricane intensity, and the storm was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm.[15] However, as the storm turned towards the east in response to the approaching trough, the center neared open waters and the winds began to re-intensify.[16] As a result, the cyclone re-attained hurricane status at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028.[1] Offshore, the center began drifting roughly eastward.[17] Entering colder waters, hurricane status was lost at 1800\u00a0UTC that day, followed by an acceleration to the northeast.[1] The storm began to lose deep thunderstorm activity, and was forecast to lose tropical characteristics and become an extratropical cyclone within days.[18] By early on August\u00a029, little connection remained over the western semicircle,[19] and only a band of such activity persisted to the southeast of the center.[20] Bonnie became extratropical around 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030, to the southeast of Newfoundland.[1]"

Tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches were put into effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. By August\u00a024, those tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued, and at the same time they were issued for parts of the Southeast United States. A hurricane warning was eventually posted for Murrells Inlet, South Carolina to the North Carolina\u00a0\u2013 Virginia border.

Heavy surf advisories were posted from central portions of the state northward to Georgia, and the National Hurricane Center advised that swimming and boating should be avoided. The Mayport Naval Station ordered 25\u00a0ships out to sea in advance of the approaching storm. The Salvation Army was on standby in Jacksonville, prepared to act when needed.[21] Hardware stores in the state reported up to a 75% increase in the sales of emergency supplies.[22] Some computer forecast models initially predicted that the storm would move towards South Carolina or Georgia.[23] Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, researchers at Clemson University used Bonnie to test a new method of estimating the damage a storm is likely to cause.[24] In the state, the South Carolina National Guard put about 1,512 men on active duty, 1,474 being of the Army National Guard.[25] On August\u00a025, the South Carolina Emergency Preparedness Division activated Level 1 operations, the highest of five levels. That same day, the State Governor declared a State of Emergency, calling for mandatory evacuations of residents east of U.S. Route 17 in Horry and Georgetown counties. Schools were closed throughout the state.[26] Over 200,000 people were evacuated from those counties, of which 120,000 were tourists.[27] About 6,000 sought shelter at schools in Horry County.[28] In a survey, 12% of respondents in the state took traffic as a significant consideration in deciding if they should evacuate.[29] On the Grand Strand, Bonnie was the first storm where buses were provided to help people evacuate.[30]"

Defense Department emergency centers were opened starting August\u00a021. Additionally, the U.S. Atlantic Command activated their 24-hour response cell.[25]  Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines evacuated equipment, including hundreds of vessels and aircraft.[25] The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources closed several state parks, all three state aquariums, and the Division of Marine Fisheries office, with plans to reopen primarily once storm-related damage at any of the locations was properly addressed.[32] A study was performed on the storm in eight counties in North Carolina to determine the cost of evacuation for hurricanes, and included 1,029 households.[33] Another study was performed regarding the actions taken during Hurricane Bonnie evacuations in the state. Tourists were interviewed, and it was found that 90% of vacationers who were threatened by the hurricane evacuated, of which 56% went home, 3% stayed in public shelters, 22% stayed with friends or relatives, 3% stayed in hotels and motels, and 16% stayed elsewhere. In total, 58% stayed within North Carolina, 12% went to Virginia, 6% relocated to South Carolina, and 24% stayed in other regions. Most of the evacuees left on August\u00a025; 80% left with their own vehicles, and 18% used rental transportation.[34] Officials in the state opened an estimated 100 shelters to accommodate the evacuating tourists and residents.[35] In Virginia, where 15 jurisdictions declared local emergencies, local governments took action to inform and protect citizens. Residents in mobile home parks, as well as campgrounds, were advised to evacuate, and 13 jurisdictions opened shelters by August\u00a026. State Governor Jim Gilmore declared a State of Emergency, and as a result, the State Emergency Operations Center was activated. Beaches and piers were shut down in Virginia Beach, Hampton, and Gloucester counties, where communities canceled some local events due to the threat of Bonnie. Voluntary evacuations throughout the state were issued, and some hotels reached maximum capacity as a result.[36] Roughly 60 Navy ships were ordered to leave port at Norfolk, and ride out the storm far out to sea.[37] The State of Virginia banned swimming along the coast.[31] As Bonnie progressed northward, a tornado watch was posted for much of eastern Virginia.[38]"

Rainfall was heavy as a result of the storm's slow movement, peaking at 11\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm) at Jacksonville, while several totals of over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) were reported. However, because the area had been experiencing drought conditions, the flooding was not as severe as it could have potentially been. The most significant flooding occurred near the Cape Fear River, where high waters were reported. The highest storm surge occurred along the beaches of Brunswick County, mostly reaching 5 to 8\u00a0ft (1.5 to 2.4\u00a0m) above average.[1] Elsewhere, flooding was mostly limited to locations with poor drainage and low-lying areas.[46] Coastal flooding was not widespread, though surge in the Pungo River flooded several local homes. Other coastal flooding was reported in various harbors and coastal cities. Part of North Carolina Highway 12 was flooded and closed on Hatteras Island due to tidal flooding. At North Topsail Beach, many of the protective dunes constructed after Hurricane Fran in 1996 were destroyed, and along the Bogue Banks, tens of thousands of tires, part of an artificial reef, were washed ashore.[46] One direct death occurred in North Carolina; a young girl was killed when a tree fell on her Currituck County home. Throughout eastern portions of the state, trees and powerlines were downed, and there were reports of structural damage.[1] Numerous docks, piers and bulkheads were either damaged or destroyed, including the Iron Steamer and Indian Beach piers, which both lost large sections to the strong wind and surf.[46] Due to the winds, the Brunswick Community Hospital lost about 3,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (280\u00a0m2). of roof and an air conditioner.[47] The storm left about 500,000 people in the state without electric power.[40] In some areas, vegetative and structural debris accumulated in piles several feet deep; it is reported that thick underbrush prevented the debris from traveling further inland.[48] Wilmington \"turned into a disaster zone\", with flooded highways, and downed trees lying across roadways.[49] Crop, particularly tobacco, damage was extensive.[46] According to then-governor Jim Hunt, \"You fly along and don't see much damage to the beach houses, and it's easy to think we didn't have much damage. But then you look at the tobacco in fields and you know the damage has been extensive.\" The crop losses accounted for much of the overall damage.[50] Forty-seven of those who failed to evacuate in time sought shelter in the Bald Head Island lighthouse as the worst of the storm bore down.[51] Despite the effects, Bonnie's impact was actually less than originally predicted.[52] Overall, property damage in the state is estimated at $240\u00a0million (1998 USD), with significantly higher crop damages.[1] Several locations received significant physical impacts. On Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, Bonnie's erosion caused an inlet to migrate further south. On the northern end of the inlet, a large sand bar developed, partially due to the storm moving offshore sand. Dune sediments were lost during the storm, exposing boardwalk piling. Similarly, on Topsail Beach, North Carolina, the storm breached 27 sand dunes, destroying 60% of the dune line.[53] Sediment from storm washover measured 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) thick behind the beach. Sections of many eroded dunes were re-built using truck loads of sand. Strong waves ran through the foundation of two stilted homes, both of which were later reinforced to compensate for the lost sand.[54]"

There were other reports of winds over 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) along the coast. Numerous homes suffered damage in the Hampton Roads area, and near Virginia Beach, winds blew windows out in hotels. Storm surge was generally around 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) with some higher reports, causing some coastal flooding. Rainfall was moderate to heavy, ranging from 1 to 7\u00a0in (25 to 178\u00a0mm), with the higher-end totals occurring in the Norfolk area.[55] Between 320,000 and 650,000 customers lost power in the state.[56][57]  The power outages led to decreased production in some water and sewer plants, prompting local officials to advise residents to conserve water. In the Ocean View section of Norfolk, the winds tore the roofs off two apartment complexes, and damaged siding on other structures. Along the coast, boats were ripped from their moorings.[50] Throughout the Tidewater region, there were estimates of thousands of downed trees, and hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged. Of these, about 40 structures were declared uninhabitable. Debris was blown several blocks inland from the coast. Among the hardest hit locations was Sandbridge, where about 12 homes were severely damaged. It is reported that the state was unprepared for the damage, expecting a strike from a weakened tropical storm. About $15.3\u00a0million (1998 USD) in damage was inflicted in the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas.[58] Throughout the state, insured losses totaled $95\u00a0million (1998 USD).[59]"

Some of the tires were buried in sand, and could only be removed during low tide. About 700 more state prisoners were sent around the state to clear debris, and 39 inmate crews were deployed to help farmers salvage the severely damaged tobacco fields.[70] In South Carolina, Horry County was declared a federal disaster area due to the damage.[42] In Virginia, the cities of Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach became eligible for individual and public assistance programs.[71] After the storm's departure, a thunderstorm temporarily halted power restoration by Virginia Power company crews.[72] Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore allowed for over $11\u00a0million (1998 USD) in state and federal funds to help five cities recover.[73] The storm also contributed to a 13.6% decline in home sales across the southern United States during the month of August by \"discouraging potential home buyers\" in coastal areas.[74] Both during and after Hurricane Bonnie's onslaught, analysis of the storm was extensive; it was deemed \"the most observed hurricane in history.\" When examined with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite imagery, it was discovered that peak cloud tops surrounding the eyewall rose 59,000\u00a0ft (18,000\u00a0m) into the atmosphere, twice as tall as Mount Everest. This was the first time that TRMM had observed such a tropical cyclone structure, according to co-developer of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, Bob Simpson.[75] The storm was also used for collection of tropical cyclone research data.

        "content": "Hurricane Michelle was the fifth costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history and the strongest hurricane of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. The thirteenth named storm and seventh hurricane that year, Michelle developed from a tropical wave that had traversed into the western Caribbean Sea on October\u00a029; the wave had initially moved off the coast of Africa 13\u00a0days prior. In its early developmental stages, the depression meandered over Nicaragua, later paralleling the Mosquito Coast before intensifying into tropical storm intensity on November\u00a01; Michelle was upgraded to hurricane strength the following day. Shortly after, rapid intensification ensued within favorable conditions, with the storm's central barometric pressure dropping 51\u00a0mbar (51\u00a0hPa; 1.5\u00a0inHg) in 29\u00a0hours. After a slight fluctuation in strength, Michelle reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 933\u00a0mbar (933\u00a0hPa; 27.6\u00a0inHg).[nb 1] This tied Michelle with 1999's Lenny as the fourth most powerful November hurricane on record in the Atlantic Basin, behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane and 2020 Hurricanes Iota and Eta. At roughly the same time, the hurricane began to accelerate northeastward; this brought the intense hurricane to a Cuban landfall within the Bay of Pigs later that day. Crossing over the island, Michelle was weakened significantly, and was only a Category\u00a01 hurricane upon reentry into the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over The Bahamas on November\u00a05, before being absorbed by a cold front the following day. Hurricane Michelle caused widespread devastation across the western Caribbean during its eight-day trek. As a tropical wave, torrential rainfall occurred across Jamaica, causing mudslides and killing two people. Damage in the island country was estimated at $18\u00a0million.[nb 2] When the storm drifted over areas of Central America early in its existence, heavy rains isolated numerous villages and damaged infrastructure, affecting areas affected by Hurricane Mitch roughly three years prior. In Honduras and Nicaragua, 14\u00a0people were killed, with an additional 62\u00a0people unaccounted for. In the Cayman Islands, areas were affected by strong storm surge and flooding, particularly in Grand Cayman, where damage was totaled $28\u00a0million. The majority of damage caused by Michelle occurred in Cuba, where the storm was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on the island in over 49\u00a0years. Strong storm surge and heavy rainfall disrupted communication networks across the country. High winds and rain also destroyed buildings and damaged the sugar cane crop. At the time, Michelle was the costliest hurricane in Cuban history with an estimated $2\u00a0billion in damage; this figure was greatly surpassed by Hurricane Ike nearly seven years later. As a weakening system, Michelle moved past Florida and the Bahamas. Strong waves caused severe beach erosion and winds damaged property. Throughout the entirety of Michelle's track, 22\u00a0people were killed, and damage was estimated at $2.43\u00a0billion (2001 USD; $4.18\u00a0billion 2024\u00a0USD). After the season, the name Michelle was retired and was replaced with Melissa for the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season."

        "content": "On October\u00a016, 2001, a tropical wave moved westward off the coast of Africa and moved into the Atlantic Ocean. At the time, the wave produced minimal convective and thunderstorm activity. On October\u00a023, the disturbance crossed the Lesser Antilles before moving into the Caribbean Sea while showing minimal signs of tropical development. Three days later, the wave moved into the western Caribbean, spawning a broad low-pressure area off the coast of Nicaragua. At 1800\u00a0UTC on October\u00a029,[1] a reconnaissance flight confirmed the development of a tropical depression 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) south-southwest of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua.[2] At the time, convection was displaced primarily to the north of the center of circulation, and the storm was situated in a weak steering pattern; as such, initial forecasts predicted for the depression, designated as Tropical Depression Fifteen, to slowly move generally northward.[3] Later that day, a burst of convection occurred over the circulation center of the depression, indicating an increase in organization.[4] The disturbance meandered over eastern Nicaragua for 36\u00a0hours before emerging into the Caribbean Sea near Cabo Gracias a Dios by 2100\u00a0UTC on October\u00a031.[1][5] Upon emerging into the Caribbean Sea, the depression quickly organized, and the National Hurricane Center\u00a0(NHC) upgraded the depression to tropical storm strength at 0000\u00a0UTC the following day, based on information from a reconnaissance flight prior. As such, the tropical storm was designated with the name Michelle.[6][7] Gradual strengthening occurred throughout November\u00a01, as Michelle's cloud tops began to cool as it drifted northward, signifying strengthening. At the time, the NHC predicted that there was a roughly 12\u00a0percent chance for the tropical storm to rapidly intensify; by that time the storm had met three of the organization's five criterion for rapid intensification.[8] During the day, fluctuations in convective activity occurred and there were some signs of wind shear affecting the cyclone, but there was a general strengthening trend.[9] Two dropsondes deployed within the system early on November\u00a02 observed hurricane-force winds within Michelle; based on this data the NHC upgraded Michelle to hurricane intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC that day,[7] while the storm was situated 290\u00a0mi (470\u00a0km) south-southeast of the Guanahacabibes Peninsula.[10] A period of rapid intensification began shortly after as Michelle's satellite presentation improved, with the cyclone's minimum barometric pressure falling 51\u00a0mbar (51\u00a0hPa; 1.5\u00a0inHg) in 29\u00a0hours.[1] At 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a03, the hurricane attained Category\u00a02 hurricane intensity. At roughly the same time, the hurricane's eye became more apparent on satellite imagery.[11] By 1200\u00a0UTC later that day, Michelle had intensified to a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[7] Six hours later, the hurricane weakened to Category\u00a03 intensity, but reached its minimum barometric pressure of 934\u00a0mbar (934\u00a0hPa; 27.6\u00a0inHg). Afterwards, Michelle's central pressure began to rise; despite the trend, its maximum sustained winds also strengthened as it curved northeastward.[7] Despite having its convective organization disrupted and its eye no longer as apparent on November\u00a04,[12] Michelle attained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) by 0600\u00a0UTC that day; these would be the highest sustained winds estimated for the system throughout its existence.[7] At 1800\u00a0UTC on November\u00a04, Michelle made landfall on Cayo Largo del Sur as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h); this was followed shortly after with a landfall on the Bay of Pigs five hours later as a slightly weaker storm. When Michelle made landfall on the Cuban mainland, it was the strongest landfalling hurricane in Cuban history since the landfall of Hurricane Fox in 1952. At the time, the hurricane's minimum barometric pressure was 950\u00a0mbar (950\u00a0hPa; 28\u00a0inHg). Over Cuba, Michelle's center of circulation was significantly disrupted, and as a result the hurricane decreased in intensity;[1] by the time it had emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on November\u00a05, winds were only estimated at 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[7] Southwesterly wind shear further inhibited any additional tropical development, and as such Michelle began to transition into an extratropical cyclone.[13] That day, the weakening hurricane made landfalls over Andros Island and Eleuthera Island before becoming fully extratropical by 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a06, while still maintaining hurricane-force winds. The extratropical system persisted for roughly 18\u00a0more hours before it was absorbed by an approaching cold front.[1]"

The Cuban Red Cross deployed 24,500\u00a0volunteers across Cuba to assist civil defense teams in evacuation procedures for potentially affected populations. By November\u00a04, an estimated 590,000\u00a0people were evacuated across the country, including 80\u00a0percent of the population of the province of Pinar del R\u00edo.[17] In Havana, authorities evacuated 150,000\u00a0people. Coastal tourist resorts were cleared, and 35,500\u00a0students were evacuated out of camps hosted on the Zapata Peninsula.[18] On Cuba's southwestern islands including Cayo Largo and Isla de la Juventud, 500\u00a0tourists were evacuated. The entire population of Surgidero de Bataban\u00f3 was evacuated.[19] In addition to the evacuations, the government sent food, water, and medicine supplies to areas south of the capital.

As a result, 163\u00a0evacuees sought shelter in locations in Annotto Bay. In Portland, a shelter was opened for effected populations;[21] in the same parish, six homes were swept away from their foundations.[22] In the parishes of Saint Catherine, Saint Andrew, and Saint Ann, several roads were blocked by debris. The Jamaican National Works Agency\u00a0(NWA) worked to clear the road debris.[21] The blocked roads isolated seven Jamaican villages for an extended period of time.[23] After tropical cyclogenesis, Michelle passed to the northwest of Jamaica, producing additional rainfall. In a 48-hour period beginning on October\u00a029, a location measured 41.65 inches (1,058\u00a0mm), denoting an average rainfall rate of 0.86 inches (22\u00a0mm) per hour.[24] Many other locations reported high rainfall totals over a ten-day period throughout Michelle's passage near Jamaica.[1] Near Spur Tree Hill, an oil spill resulted from the flooding. Roads that were previously cleaned of debris a few days prior were covered again by the additional rainfall. The rains also disrupted the country's communication and electrical grid, leaving 6,000\u00a0homes without power in affected regions. The widespread power outages in conjunction with invasive floodwaters also caused the cessation of 31\u00a0water plants run by the National Water Commission. Overall, 30\u00a0homes were destroyed by flooding caused by Michelle as it passed to the northwest. Extensive damage was reported to small livestock, bananas, plantains, vegetables, and coffee.[25] Coffee crops were severely affected in Portland and Saint Andrew Parishes, with losses calculated at J$102.6\u00a0million (US$2.2\u00a0million). Roughly 400 acres (160 hectares) of banana plantations were damaged over four parishes, amounting to J$18.2\u00a0million (US$400,000) in damage. The plantain crop, mostly grown for domestic usage, suffered extensive damage valued at J$22\u00a0million (US$480,000). Losses sustained to livestock were estimated at J$30.8\u00a0million (US$670,000).[26] Overall, floods caused widespread damage throughout Jamaica. The watersheds of the Spanish and Swift Rivers were the worst affected areas. Near the coast, the rivers began to overflow due to excess floodwater, eroding beach roads and three major highways. In Portland Parish, the rains caused numerous landslides. In the community of Bybrook alone, it was estimated that roughly 7,000,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft (200,000\u00a0m3) of material was deposited in the village. An assessment of the damage concluded that 500\u00a0homes were destroyed beyond repair, while an additional 561\u00a0homes were at least damaged by the floods and heavy rain. While one school was damaged solely by the floods, six other schools were damaged due to their use as shelters.[26] Damage on Jamaica due to Michelle totaled $18\u00a0million,[27] of which $11.8\u00a0million was due to crop and livestock losses. Damage to bridges alone totaled J$143.7\u00a0million (US$3.1\u00a0million). Five fatalities were also confirmed,[26] and 340\u00a0people were displaced from their homes.[27]"

The hardest hit region was Gracias a Dios Department in northeastern Honduras, where at one point 100\u00a0villages were isolated by the floods. The torrential rainfall caused the displacement of at least 100,000\u00a0people from their residences.[1] Across Central America, over 27,300\u00a0people were evacuated from flooded areas.[28] In Honduras, the floods damaged 245\u00a0homes, resulting in the displacement of 4,393\u00a0people across the country. Six bridges sustained at least partial damage, of which three were destroyed. As a result of the damage, the government of Honduras declared a state of emergency for five departments\u00a0\u2013 Col\u00f3n, Atl\u00e1ntida, Yoro, Cort\u00e9s, and Santa B\u00e1rbara.[29] The floods caused by Michelle were further exacerbated by a cold front which lingered over the region, dropping additional rainfall.[28] Of the affected departments, Yoro was the most affected, with no supply of drinkable water and electricity following the flooding.[30] Near Yoro, a bridge crossing the Cuyamapa River collapsed due to the floodwaters.[31] Despite the heavy rainfall, areas of Honduras suffering from a prolonged drought did not receive beneficial rainfall.[32] Overall, the floods in Honduras killed 21\u00a0people and caused $5\u00a0million in damage.[33] Thirty-five of the country's water systems were destroyed. The rains also caused the loss of 70\u00a0percent of bean crops.[34] Although the precursor to Michelle remained stationary primarily over Nicaragua, damage was not as significant as in Honduras due to the storm's displacement of convection to the north.[1] Nonetheless, floods still isolated villages and other communities in the Nicaraguan districts of Bonaza, Rosita, Siuna, Puerto Cabezas, Waspam, and to a lesser extent, Prinzapolka. In those areas, roads and bridges were damaged, and in some cases, destroyed. The heavy rains also damaged crops.[30] Due to the rains, an estimated 6,000\u00a0people evacuated from their homes. The port city of Puerto Cabezas was partially flooded.[35] As a result of Michelle, a total of 16\u00a0deaths were confirmed, and damage in the country was estimated at $1\u00a0million.[33] In Costa Rica, Michelle caused anomalously high rainfall, resulting in flooding.[36] Overall, damage in Costa Rica totaled $1\u00a0million, though no deaths were reported.[33]"

Rainfall amounts up to 754\u00a0mm/29.69\u00a0inches were recorded across the island.[42] In addition, 300\u00a0mm/11.83\u00a0inches was reported at Punta del Este. The provinces of Matanzas, Villa Clara, and Cienfuegos were hardest hit, where 10,000 homes were destroyed and another 100,000 damaged. Severe damage was also reported to the sugar cane[1] and in the tourist town of Varadero. In Havana, winds and rain destroyed 23 buildings, with many others damaged.

The storm is also tied with 2006's Hurricane Ioke as the fifth-strongest Pacific hurricane on record. It was the first named storm of the 1973 Pacific hurricane season. Forming in early June, Hurricane Ava eventually reached Category\u00a05 intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale, the first Pacific hurricane to do so in June and the earliest ever in a season. Its central pressure made it the most intense known Pacific hurricane at the time. Despite its intensity, Ava stayed at sea without significant impact. Ava was given the most advanced measurement and reconnaissance available at the time. Recon flights were conducted and meteorological equipment was tested. The hurricane was also photographed from space by satellites and Skylab astronauts."

        "content": "On June 2, 1973, a tropical depression formed about 250 miles (400\u00a0km) south of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. It started out nearly stationary, and became a tropical storm late on the same day it formed, the first named storm of the 1973 Pacific hurricane season. Ava then slowly moved westwards away from Mexico and became a hurricane on June 3. Ava became a major hurricane on the afternoon of June 5. On the next day, a United States Air Force recon flight measured a wind speed of 150 miles per hour (240 kilometers per hour) and a central pressure of 915 millibars (27.0 inches of mercury). These measurements made Hurricane Ava by far the most intense storm of the season.[1] At its peak, Ava had winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h).[1] These winds made the storm a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS), the highest category on the scale,[2] and the first Category\u00a05 hurricane since the 1959 season.[3] Ava was also a hurricane with windspeeds rapidly increasing the closer to the eye they were measured. Over a distance of 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km), wind speeds increased from 70 to 158\u00a0mph (113 to 254\u00a0km/h), and they increased from 105 to 158\u00a0mph (169 to 254\u00a0km/h) over half that distance. The reading of 915\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg) was roughly 100\u00a0mbar (3.0\u00a0inHg) lower than the ambient environment far from the storm.[1] After its peak, Ava started weakening on June 7, as it continued its westward path. Its winds were 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) on June 7 and 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) on the next day. It was no longer a major hurricane after its winds fell to 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) on June 9. Later that day it weakened to a tropical storm. It then weakened to a tropical depression on June 11. The system then turned north and dissipated on June 12. Its remnants then became embedded in the trade winds as a tropical wave.[1]"

        "content": "In terms of how well it was forecast, Ava had the largest error of any cyclone during the season. This 14\u00b0 error five days out was mainly due to its northward turn when it was a weakening depression.[1] For a few days, Ava was directly underneath Skylab during its first manned mission.[1] Astronauts acquired photographs of the hurricane,[4] which was big enough for Science Pilot Joseph Kerwin to describe it as \"an enormous spiral\" that was big enough to dominate the view outside the space station's window and prevent anything else from being seen.[5] Astronauts also provided microwave data through Earth Resources Experiment Package sensors.[4] Skylab also used a scatterometer on the system.[6] Unfortunately, Skylab's scatterometer data was harder to use than normal as it was degraded.[7] Ava was also underneath the NOAA-2 and Nimbus 5 weather satellites. NOAA-2 provided photographs that were used to estimate Ava's maximum windspeeds. Satellite images were useful throughout the cyclone's existence, as did the wind reports of three ships when Ava was a young tropical storm.[1] Nimbus 5 carried an Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer and Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer.[8] Both were used to study Ava. The main data provided by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions. The observations also provided confirmation that clouds that are not vertically developed very much can produce tropical rainfall.[9] Recon aircraft also penetrated Hurricane Ava. It was the first Pacific hurricane penetrated by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration aircraft,[10] but not by aircraft from other agencies.[11] NOAA craft were laden with sensors and measured wave heights reaching 40 feet (12 metres) with a microwave radar system and a laser altimeter.[1] That was the first time ever that sea conditions in a tropical cyclone had been measured that way.[1] United States Air Force planes measured central pressure, air temperature, and humidity in the eye pressures using dropsondes.[1] The collection of data from both space and the air was done in order to allow comparisons.[12] Collectively, all of this measuring made Hurricane Ava the best-measured northeastern Pacific tropical cyclone at the time.[1]"

        "content": "Hurricane Ava stayed at sea.[13] Consequently, no one was killed and there was no reported damage. However, when it was a recently named tropical storm, Ava did cause sustained winds below gale-force to three ships called the Joseph Lykes, Hoegh Trotter, and Volnay.[1] In addition, large ocean waves churned up by Ava created hazardous surf and strong riptides at Southern California beaches on June 9 and June 10. Those waves reached heights of up to 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) at Newport Beach, 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) at Long Beach, and 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) at Seal Beach. Those waves made beaches more hazardous, resulting in double-to-triple the usual contingent of lifeguards throughout Southern California beaches. At Seal Beach and Newport Beach, lifeguards made 35 and 75 rescues, respectively.[14] When it was active, Hurricane Ava set many records. Several have since been broken, but Ava still holds a few. Ava ceased being a Category\u00a05 hurricane on June 7, 1973.[3] Emilia (1994) reached Category\u00a05 intensity on July 19, 1994.[15] This span of 7,712\u00a0days, which Ava began and Emilia ended, is the longest time between successive Category\u00a05 hurricanes in the northeastern Pacific, and anywhere worldwide, in recorded history. When Hurricane Gilma reached Category\u00a05 strength on July 24, also in 1994, it marked the shortest gap between Category\u00a05 Pacific hurricanes recorded.[3] Ava was also a Category\u00a05 hurricane for exactly 24\u00a0hours; a record at the time. Hurricane John broke that in the 1994 season, and hurricanes Linda and Ioke also lasted longer, tied with John.[16] In addition, Ava is the strongest June tropical cyclone in the western hemisphere north of the equator.[3][17] A spokesperson from the U.S. National Weather Service was quoted as saying that, \"Ava had sustained winds of about 180\u00a0knots with some gusts at 200\u00a0knots when she  [sic] was peaking\".[14] However, the official \"Best track\" data file and the seasonal summary in the Monthly Weather Review contradict that report and give maximum winds of 140\u00a0knots.[1][3] If Ava's winds were that high, they would one of the highest ever reported in a tropical cyclone anywhere. Like any report of winds that high it is suspect.[18] At the time, Hurricane Ava's minimum known pressure of 915\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg) was the lowest-known in its basin, making Ava the most intense Pacific hurricane. Ava is now the fifth-most intense, tied with Hurricane Ioke, as hurricanes Patricia, Linda, Rick and Kenna recorded lower pressures.[3] However, Linda's and Rick's pressures were only estimated from satellite imagery,[19] so Ava held the record for lowest measured pressure until Kenna surpassed it in 2002.[20] However, the meteorological record for the eastern north Pacific are unreliable because geostationary satellite observation did not begin until 1966.[19] Ava's pressure record is itself incomplete; Ava was only a Category\u00a04 when its 915\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg) pressure was measured, and the only reading from when it was a Category\u00a05 hurricane is 928\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg).[21] These two factors mean that Ava's lowest pressure may be below 915\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg), and that there may be other cyclones stronger than Ava.[22]"

        "content": "Hurricane Connie was a Category 4 hurricane that contributed to significant flooding across the eastern United States in August 1955, just days before Hurricane Diane affected the same general area. Connie formed on August\u00a03 from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It moved quickly west-northwestward, strengthening into a hurricane by August\u00a04. Connie first posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, ultimately passing about 105\u00a0mi (169\u00a0km) north of the island group. In the United States Virgin Islands, three people died due to the hurricane, and a few homes were destroyed. The outer rainbands produced hurricane-force wind gusts and intense precipitation, reaching 8.65\u00a0in (220\u00a0mm) in Puerto Rico. On the island, Connie destroyed 60\u00a0homes and caused crop damage. After affecting Puerto Rico, Connie reached maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h), and a barometric pressure of 944\u00a0mbar (27.9\u00a0inHg), as observed by the Hurricane Hunters on August\u00a07. The hurricane later weakened, slowed its forward motion, and turned to the north, striking North Carolina on August\u00a012 as a Category\u00a02 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Connie was the first of three damaging tropical cyclones in the 1955 hurricane season to hit the state, along with Diane and Ione. The storm progressed inland after moving through the Chesapeake Bay region, and was later absorbed by a cold front over Lake Huron on August\u00a015. Ahead of the storm, the United States Weather Bureau issued widespread hurricane warnings, spurring evacuations, flight cancelations, and beach closures. Connie produced strong winds, high tides, and heavy rainfall as it moved ashore, causing heavy crop damage and 27\u00a0deaths in North Carolina. Four people were killed in Washington, D.C. due to a traffic accident caused by slick roads. In Chesapeake Bay, Connie capsized a boat, killing 14\u00a0people and prompting a change in Coast Guard regulations. There were six deaths each in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and 14\u00a0deaths in New York, where record rainfall flooded houses and subways. At least 295,000\u00a0people nationwide lost electric power during the storm. Damage in the United States totaled around $86\u00a0million (1955\u00a0USD).[nb 1] The rains from Connie contributed to flooding from Hurricane Diane that caused $700\u00a0million in damage. The remnants of Connie killed three people in Ontario, and also destroyed a few houses and boats in the province. As a result of its impacts, including a death toll of 77, the name Connie was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list."

        "content": "A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression to the west of the Cape Verde islands on August\u00a03, 1955, based on reports from two nearby ships. The depression moved quickly west-northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Connie. A Hurricane Hunters flight on August\u00a04 reported a developing eye feature. Observations from the flight, as well as a nearby ship, suggested that Connie attained hurricane status on August\u00a04. The hurricane continued to intensify as it approached the northern Lesser Antilles, passing about 105\u00a0mi (169\u00a0km) north of the island group on August\u00a06. Later that day, the storm strengthened to major hurricane status, or a Category\u00a03 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.[1][2] After passing the Lesser Antilles, Connie turned more to the northwest as it rounded a large ridge. A Hurricane Hunters flight on August\u00a07 observed an eye shaped like an inverted cone \u2013 larger at flight-level, and a diameter of 9\u00a0mi (14\u00a0km) at the surface. The plane also observed a minimum barometric pressure of 944\u00a0mbar (27.88\u00a0inHg), the lowest in association with the hurricane. Based on the observations, the Hurricane Research Division estimated maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h), making Connie a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[2] The hurricane progressed northwestward, passing northeast of The Bahamas. The eye grew in size, and the combination of upwelling and cooler air resulted in weakening. Connie fell below major hurricane status on August\u00a09. A building ridge to its northeast, as well as some interaction with developing Hurricane Diane to its southeast, caused Connie to move slower toward the west-northwest. On August\u00a010, the hurricane turned to the north as it moved toward the southeast United States coast. On August\u00a012, Connie restrengthened slightly, reaching a secondary peak intensity of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). The hurricane made landfall near Fort Macon State Park in North Carolina at that intensity around 15:00\u00a0UTC.[1][2] Hurricane Connie weakened as it moved through eastern North Carolina. The storm approached the Atlantic coast near the North Carolina/Virginia border. After passing through the Hampton Roads area, Connie turned back to the north-northwest, steered by a strengthening upper-level trough and low, located over Illinois. On August\u00a013, Connie fell below hurricane intensity as it moved through the Chesapeake Bay region. The track shifted to the northwest, and Connie moved across western Pennsylvania, into Lake Erie. While still a tropical storm, Connie moved across portions of Southwestern Ontario, Lake Huron, and Michigan. On August\u00a015, an approaching cold front absorbed the dissipating storm.[2]"

The National Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for Barbuda, Saba and Antigua. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were placed on hurricane alert as warnings were possible later that day.[3] Along the northern coast of Puerto Rico, the threat of Connie forced 40,000\u00a0people to evacuate their homes.[4] After Connie affected Puerto Rico, a storm warning was issued for the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, and a hurricane warning was issued for the eastern Bahamas.[5] While Connie was meandering in the western Atlantic Ocean, its potential track posed problems for forecasters, due to its slow movement near the southeast United States coastline.[1] On August\u00a07, a hurricane warning was issued from North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia, with a hurricane alert issued farther north to New York City.[6] The Weather Bureau later extended the hurricane warnings to Delaware Breakwater, with storm warnings farther northeast to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The alert for North Carolina was up for about three days until Connie moved inland.[7] Ahead of the storm, the United States military flew its planes away from the coast to safer shelters further inland.[8] Two people were killed when they crashed the Navy plane they were evacuating. Large Naval ships rode out the storm at sea, while smaller vessels anchored in Tangier. More than 100\u00a0merchant vessels from a dozen counties anchored in the waters of Hampton Roads, or while small boats were secured at port. The American Red Cross opened at least 79\u00a0shelters, and mobilized 41\u00a0officials with hurricane experience. The Coast Guard ordered four towns along beaches to evacuate, and overall about 14,000\u00a0people evacuated the coastline.[9][10][11] About 2,000\u00a0people evacuated from flood-prone areas in New Bern, North Carolina.[7] In Philadelphia, the Boy Scouts evacuated 800\u00a0scouts from Camp Delmont due to the threat of the hurricane.[12] The threat of Connie also canceled a flight by President Dwight Eisenhower from Gettysburg to Washington, D.C., prompting him to travel instead by car.[13] More than 300\u00a0residents evacuated in North Jersey.[14] Beaches were closed in New Jersey and New York. An annual parade in Ocean City, New Jersey was postponed due to the storm. Dozens of flights in and out of the New York area were canceled due to weather conditions. The storm also prompted the Canadian Army to halt military exercises.[15]"

Rainfall reached 7.04\u00a0in (179\u00a0mm) in Charlotte Amalie on Saint Thomas. Two people drowned on the island, and one person was electrocuted due to Connie's passage. The hurricane also destroyed a few shacks and boats on Saint Thomas. In Puerto Rico, high winds and waves destroyed 60\u00a0poorly-built houses.

        "content": "Hurricane Connie produced hurricane-force winds in North Carolina and Virginia.[2] Across the Northeastern United States, many areas were in drought conditions before the storm struck. Unusually moist air caused above normal air and water temperatures, resulting in heavy rainfall across the eastern United States. Storm-related rainfall spread from the South Carolina, northeast to Maine, and as far west as Michigan. Record rainfall occurred in Philadelphia and New York City, and the highest precipitation related to Connie was 13.24\u00a0in (336\u00a0mm) at Fort Schuyler in New York.Connie's rains preceded additional rainfall from Hurricane Diane just four days later, which together caused widespread flooding.[17][18][16] Along Connie's western periphery, the rainbands spawned at least six tornadoes, of which five in South Carolina and one in North Carolina.[1] Damage from Connie in the United States was estimated at $86,065,000, mostly in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland.[19] When Connie struck North Carolina, it produced sustained winds of 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) in Morehead City, with gusts to 83\u00a0mph (134\u00a0km/h). Wind gusts near where the hurricane moved ashore reached 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), although it was uncertain whether the gust was estimated or measured.[1] Frying Pan Shoals, located offshore, reported a gust of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h).[20] The hurricane produced tides up to 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) above normal while moving slowly ashore, which resulted in significant beach erosion.[1] Tides were higher at Swansboro, North Carolina than during Hurricane Hazel the previous October,[20] and many piers that were rebuilt after Hazel were damaged or again destroyed by Connie.[7] The storm surge flooded low-lying portions of Wilmington.[21] High waves in advance of the storm flooded coastal roads along the Outer Banks.[9] Rainfall amounts of over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) in the area west of where Connie made landfall.[16] Stream flooding occurred as far inland as Raleigh, but was most significant near the coast.[22] Along the Pamlico River in Washington, National Guardsmen were ordered to help about 1,000\u00a0people evacuate during the storm.[7] Outer rainbands knocked out power lines in coastal North Carolina.[20] Flooding-induced rainfall closed U.S. Route 17 near New Bern.[7] Throughout North Carolina, the hurricane caused about $40\u00a0million in damage, of which about 75% was from crop damage.[1] There were 27\u00a0deaths in the state related to Connie, including traffic deaths, drownings, people in damaged buildings, and electrocutions.[21] In South Carolina to the south of the center, the hurricane destroyed 40\u00a0buildings in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[21] Connie also damaged fishing piers, breakwaters, and housing shingles. Newspapers considered the damage \"mild\" compared to that from Hazel the previous year.[23] As Connie progressed northward, it continued to drop significant amounts of precipitation. Totals of over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) were reported on both sides of Chesapeake Bay, in Pennsylvania, and in southeastern New York.[16] Rainfall in Richmond, Virginia totaled 8.79\u00a0in (223\u00a0mm) on August\u00a012, breaking the day's precipitation record.[24] Severe river flooding occurred in Virginia, from the coast inland to Richmond.[22] Floods washed out a portion of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad near Lankford, and covered portions of five area highways, including U.S.\u00a01 and U.S. 301. The storm downed trees and caused scattered power outages for at least 5,000\u00a0people in the state.[24][25] Ten river gauges in Virginia, as well as sixteen in neighboring Maryland, reached the highest stage on record.[22] More than 100\u00a0traffic accidents occurred in Washington D.C. due to slick roads; one accident killed four people, after a car was sideswiped and knocked into a swollen creek where the occupants drowned.[25][26] The combination of strong winds and high waves wrecked a 125\u00a0ft (38\u00a0m) schooner in the Chesapeake Bay named the Levin J. Marvel.[21] The 64-year old boat was described as \"unseaworthy\" when it left from Annapolis, Maryland, and capsized near Fairhaven. Of the 23\u00a0passengers and four crew members, 14\u00a0people drowned, making it \"one of the worst maritime calamities in the history of Tidewater Maryland\", as described by The Baltimore Sun. The other passengers were later rescued after holding onto wreckage.[27] Farther from the storm's immediate landfall, Connie's precipitation was beneficial Delaware due to prior drought conditions.[28][29] Wind gusts in the state reached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) on a control tower at the New Castle County Airport.[30] The storm spawned a waterspout in Bethany Beach, which knocked off the roofs of a dozen homes, caused a six-hour power outage, and caused a minor injury when a teenager was flown 60\u00a0ft (18\u00a0m).[31] The rains caused flooding that was described as \"inconsequential\" by the United States Geological Survey, due to preceding drought conditions.[29] There were six storm deaths in New Jersey \u2013 one by drowning, one by electrocution, and four in traffic accidents. The winds and rains knocked down trees and power lines, leaving about 180,000\u00a0people without power, and about 20,000\u00a0people without phone service. Nearly every police and fire department in Bergen County, along with over 500\u00a0electricians, responded to the outages. Manville declared a state of emergency that lasted for 19.5\u00a0hours, after three nearby rivers exceeded their banks. A nun in Tenafly required rescue from a trapped elevator during a power outage. Flooding closed portions of the White Horse Pike and other roads near Camden, causing traffic jams.[14][32][33][34] There were also six deaths in neighboring Pennsylvania \u2013 four due to traffic accidents, and two people in their cars swept away by floods. Rainfall reached 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) in southeastern Pennsylvania, with 4.83\u00a0in (123\u00a0mm) recorded in Philadelphia over a 24-hour period; it was the city's highest daily rainfall in 57\u00a0years. The deluge exceeded the capacity of sewers and creeks, closed roads, and entered the basements of homes, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate.[18][35][34] Three days' of rainfall caused creeks to rise in the Lehigh Valley.[28] About 10,000\u00a0people lost power in Pennsylvania, but service was quickly restored.[28] U.S. Marines evacuated a group of 63\u00a0Girl Scouts from Camp Helena near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, after floods from a nearby creek threatened the group.[36] A boy required rescue from the flooded Darby Creek.[37] Heavy rainfall, totaling over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) affected southeastern New York, causing heavy damage, and killing 11\u00a0people in the New York metropolitan area, and three people upstate.[16][29][38][39] Hurricane Connie brought the heaviest rain seen in New York City in over 50\u00a0years, totaling 5.32\u00a0in (135\u00a0mm) within a 20-hour span.[26] Large areas of the city were flooded, inundating subways and thousands of houses. About 100,000\u00a0people lost power in the city.[40] High winds and tides from the storm cancelled ferry service,[40] and forced LaGuardia Airport to temporarily shut down after flooding reached 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) deep.[21][18] Flooding washed out a portion of the Delaware and Hudson Railway in the Helderberg Mountains, causing two trains to derail; there were no injuries.[39] In Monroe and Wayne counties, the storm damaged the peach and apple crops.[41] The Chenango County Fair closed early due to the storms' rains.[42] In coastal Connecticut, the rainfall from Connie increased levels along streams, but there was little damage.[22] When the remnants of Connie entered Ontario on August 14, it continued to produce winds of up to 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h), and the storm dropped 2.56\u00a0in (65\u00a0mm) of rainfall near the Great Lakes. In Burlington, 27\u00a0boats were destroyed, and one fisherman drowned in Lake Erie after his boat sank during the storm. Two other people drowned in the province. Connie destroyed six houses and damaged several others due to high waves. The storm also caused power outages and damage to the tobacco crop.[43] Late in the storm's path through the United States, Connie produced wind gusts of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) along Lake Huron in Michigan, causing high waves that damaged or sank many small boats. Damage in Michigan was estimated at $150,000.[44]"

Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie.[45] Damage from Diane totaled at least $700\u00a0million,[1] and six states were declared federal disaster areas from the combined hurricanes' impact; this allowed federal assistance for the affected areas.[45] Immediately after the storm, the U.S. Small Business Administration authorized low-interest loans for homes and businesses affected by Connie.[46] The loss of the Levin J. Marvel during the hurricane prompted the United States Congress to pass a law in 1956, which allowed the Coast Guard to inspect all vessels with more than six passengers; the previous law only allowed inspections for boats of more than 700\u00a0tons, much higher than the 183\u00a0tons that the Marvel displaced. The inexperienced captain was charged with negligence and manslaughter and stood trial before the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore. Those charges carried a prison term of 11\u00a0years. Judge Robert Dorsey Watkins, however, acquitted him of the manslaughter charge, instead sentencing him to one-year probation for negligence.[27] Due to its destructive impact and high death toll, the name Connie was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list by the U.S. Weather Bureau after the 1955 season. It was one of four names retired from that that year.[47]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Jose was first identified as a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August\u00a08, 2005.[2] On August\u00a013, the system spawned Tropical Depression Ten over the central Atlantic;[3] the wave itself continued westward, entering the Caribbean on August\u00a017. Slight development took place as the system moved over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula; however, by the time it entered the Bay of Campeche on August\u00a021, little convection was associated with the system. The following morning, convection exploded under highly favorable divergence from an upper-level anticyclonic flow. According to readings from the QuikSCAT satellite, a well-defined low pressure center developed by 1200\u00a0UTC, prompting the National Hurricane Center to classify the system as Tropical Depression Eleven. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 110\u00a0mi (175\u00a0km) east of Veracruz, Mexico.[2] Situated over very warm waters and within an area of low wind shear, the depression was able to quickly organize; however, due to its proximity to land, the NHC noted, \"the system does not have very long...to take advantage of these favorable conditions.\" Located to the south of a mid-level ridge, the depression tracked just north of due west and kept this motion through the remainder of its existence.[4] The depression rapidly intensified as it moved to the west, becoming Tropical Storm Jose just six hours later. The global model guidance initially failed to resolve the storm's track well, with some models indicating that it would stall offshore.[5] Jose continued to strengthen as it moved towards the coast and made landfall north of Veracruz city early on August 23 with winds reaching a peak of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[2] As Jose made its landfall an eye was beginning to form, although the storm was still well short of hurricane intensity.[6] Tropical Storm Jose quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated that afternoon in the mountains of central Mexico only 24\u00a0hours after forming.[2]"

The area covered by the warning issued on August 22 was extended southwards as Jose intensified, before being canceled soon after landfall on August 23. The advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center emphasized that rainfall from Jose was the primary threat.[2] Across Mexico, Jose killed 16\u00a0people \u2013 five were in Veracruz's capital Xalapa, six were in elsewhere in Veracruz due a landslide,[7] and five were in Oaxaca due to mudslides.[2] Tropical Storm Jose was responsible for damaging crops, highways and homes; flooding districts in several cities in the state of Veracruz, and the evacuation of 80,000\u00a0people to shelters. The government of that state estimated the damages caused by the storm to be approximately $45\u00a0million (2005 USD). Approximately 120\u00a0municipalities were affected by the torrential rain, but the majority of the damage was concentrated to eight of them: Mart\u00ednez de la Torre, Misantla, Nautla, San Rafael, Vega de la Torre, Actopan, Cardel and \u00darsulo Galv\u00e1n.

        "content": " Tropical Storm Hernan was a short-lived tropical cyclone that brought widespread flooding and destructive mudslides to southwestern Mexico in late August 2020. Hernan was the thirteenth tropical cyclone and eighth named storm[a] of the 2020 Pacific hurricane season.[2] The system developed from a low-pressure area to the southwest of Mexico on August 26, as a low-end tropical storm. Moving generally northward and paralleling the west coast of Mexico, Hernan was hindered by a high wind shear environment and only slightly strengthened. The cyclone achieved its peak intensity around 06:00 UTC on August 27 with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,001\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg). Passing just offshore of the state of Jalisco, Hernan turned west and degenerated to a remnant low on August 28. The low passed near the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula later that day and dissipated shortly thereafter. Despite Hernan's short existence, it dropped more than 280\u00a0millimeters (11\u00a0inches) of rain across many areas of southwestern Mexico, with accumulations peaking at 590\u00a0mm (23.24\u00a0in) in Jalisco. Multiple highways had to be shut down due to dangerous conditions, including mudslides and rivers overflowing their banks. Several schools suffered damage in the state of Colima, and in the city of Manzanillo, homes, businesses, and streets were damaged and covered in mud. Nearly 20,000 people were greatly affected by Hernan in Jalisco, and 1,674 houses and 9 schools suffered severe damage. In that state, a man fell off his roof and died while inspecting it for damage following the storm. Severe damage was also reported in Guerrero, with the most significant flooding taking place in the Costa Grande region. Lesser effects of the storm were felt in several other coastal states across western Mexico. Recovery efforts were undertaken by the Mexican Armed Forces across several states. Total damage from Hernan in Mexico was estimated to be MXN$594.05\u00a0million (USD$26.91\u00a0million).[b]"

        "content": "In late August 2020, the monsoon trough over the Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone basin became active, following the passage of Hurricane Genevieve. As Genevieve weakened west of the Baja California Peninsula, the monsoon trough, aided by a pulse of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, developed three separate areas of low pressure. One of the lows formed on August 21, to the southwest of mainland Mexico. The low moved slowly eastward, initially unable to organize its convective (shower and thunderstorm) activity due to its large size. However, beginning on August 24, the low and its associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to slowly become better organized and defined within marginally favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis. After developing a cyclonic circulation and gale-force winds on August 26, the low became a tropical storm around 06:00 UTC that day, about 545\u00a0kilometers (340\u00a0miles) southwest of the municipality of Cabo Corrientes.[1] However, the United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) operationally[c] did not recognize the system as having reached tropical storm strength until 21:00 UTC that day, at which time it was named Hernan. Upon naming Hernan, the NHC noted that the storm was also located on the eastern side of a broad monsoon gyre, causing it to move in an eastward-to-northward fashion. Additionally, the system was facing strong easterly wind shear[d] and was slightly elongated from northeast to southwest, inhibiting potential strengthening.[3][4] Despite these unfavorable conditions, cloud tops south and west of Hernan's center cooled to between \u221283 and \u221286\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212117 and \u2212123\u00a0\u00b0F) as its convection increased, allowing the cyclone to strengthen slightly.[5] Hernan achieved peak intensity at 06:00 UTC on August 27 with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,001\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg).[1] Continuous wind shear caused Hernan to weaken shortly thereafter, restricting convection to the western portion of the storm's circulation.[6] Continuing to move counterclockwise around the monsoon gyre, Hernan passed over the Gulf of California and turned to the west early on August 28. The system weakened to a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC that day as most of its associated convection dissipated.[1][7] Hernan degenerated to a remnant low six hours later just off the southern coast of Baja California Sur.[1][8] The remnants of Hernan continued westward around the gyre, which contained Tropical Storm Iselle, another tropical cyclone located to the south. By 00:00 UTC on August 29, the remnants of Hernan were completely absorbed by the gyre.[1]"

Another 211 residents were evacuated to six shelters across Guerrero.[10] Approximately 97,000 people across Colima, Michoac\u00e1n, and Jalisco lost electricity due to Hernan.[11] At least seven people across the coast were rescued by air following inundation of their houses by flood waters.[12] Over 250 state and federal workers were dispatched to areas affected by Hernan, while workers from different agencies traveled by helicopter to bring food and supplies.[13] Secretary of the Navy Jos\u00e9 Rafael Ojeda Dur\u00e1n implemented the Mexican Navy's Marine Plan, under which naval personnel carried out the evacuation of people trapped by flooding, removed debris, cleaned beaches, and transferred food and equipment to victims of the storm. Over 450 units (vehicles) of army machinery were used to carry out the Marine Plan: 60 maritime units, 6 aircraft, and 391 land units.[12] Following the storm, a special federal damage assessment committee estimated losses from Hernan totaled MXN$594.05\u00a0million pesos (US$26.91\u00a0million)[e] during August 24\u201327.[14]"

The severe flooding prompted the closure of five federal highways between Jalisco and the neighboring states of Colima and Nayarit.[16][17] Heavy rains left 30 communities in Jalisco without power; 18 people took shelter on their roofs during the flooding and had to be rescued by armed forces members. Landslides and mudslides covered parts of federal highways 80 and 200 and required clearing by federal workers.[9] In the towns of Melaque and La Manzanilla, heavy flooding caused the nearby Cuixmala River to overflow, while rising waters in the El Pedregal stream led to flooding that prompted the opening of three temporary storm shelters in Jaluco and Melaque.[18] Citizens in Melaque had to travel by boat to navigate flooded streets.[19] Severe flooding of homes and roads in Cihuatl\u00e1n and La Huerta prompted the opening of four temporary shelters in the former municipality, which held 365 displaced residents.[20][21] 250 homes were damaged in Cihuatl\u00e1n, while another 228 were damaged in La Huerta. A man died in La Huerta when he fell from his roof while checking for damage from Hernan.[13] Over 350 people from Cihuatl\u00e1n and Tomatl\u00e1n had to be transferred to temporary storm shelters.[22] At least 19,968 people were impacted and in need of support across Jalisco following Hernan.[23] The Jalisco State Emergency Committee declared states of emergency in the municipalities of Tomatl\u00e1n, Casimiro Castillo, Cihuatl\u00e1n, La Huerta, Villa Purificaci\u00f3n, Cabo Corrientes and Cuautitl\u00e1n de Garc\u00eda Barrag\u00e1n after the passage of the cyclone.[24] Resources from both the federal government's Fondo Nacional de Desastres Naturales (National Fund for Natural Disasters) and Jalisco's Fondo Estatal de Desastres Naturales (State Fund for Natural Disasters) were given to the seven aforementioned municipalities. Food pantries, mats, hygiene kits, and water were among the supplies given to the residents of 1,674 damaged homes.[23] The federal legislature requested that the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Agua\u00a0[es] (National Water Commission) carry out studies and take further preventive actions to address the lack of storm-resistant infrastructure in many coastal municipalities of Jalisco.[25]"

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the storm formed at around midnight on the night of 2 December over Craigieburn, then grew in size as it moved in a south-easterly direction (the Bureau issued a severe thunderstorm warning based on their observations at 11.38\u00a0pm).[1] The two hours from midnight to 2\u00a0am saw extremely heavy rainfall, with some areas recording more than 100\u00a0mm of rain in that time. The rapid rainfall caused flash flooding, which resulted in extensive damage to property.[2] A number of motorists were trapped on the roofs of their cars as chest-high floodwater accumulated under the Bulleen Road Bridge on the Eastern Freeway. They were rescued by Melbourne's Metropolitan Fire Brigade using two maritime response unit boats. Severe hailstorms caused thousands of dollars of damage to cars in the suburb of Lilydale. Rail company Connex Melbourne announced that flooding and power damage at Blackburn, Surrey Hills and Boronia railway stations would cause transport delays the following day.

Iris was the second-strongest storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, behind Hurricane Michelle.[1] It was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane[nb 1] of the year, forming from a tropical wave on October\u00a04 just southeast of Barbados. It moved westward through the Caribbean, intensifying into a tropical storm on October\u00a05 south of Puerto Rico, and into a hurricane on the following day. While passing south of the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides, killing eight people. Later, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica, where it destroyed two houses. On reaching the western Caribbean Sea, Iris rapidly intensified into a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. A small hurricane with an eye of only 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) in diameter, Iris reached peak winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) before making landfall in southern Belize near Monkey River Town on October\u00a09. The hurricane quickly dissipated over Central America, although its remnants contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Manuel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The hurricane caused severe damage\u2014destroying homes, flooding streets, and leveling trees\u2014in coastal towns south of Belize City. Destruction was heaviest in Belize and totaled $250\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD).[nb 2] Because Iris was compact, the damage was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718\u00a0homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35\u00a0villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000\u00a0people homeless, many receiving assistance from the government and the local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24\u00a0people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500\u00a0homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died."

        "content": "Toward the end of September 2001, a poorly-defined tropical wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, through an area of hostile wind shear, which was caused by a large upper-level low within a trough, to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles.[3] A few days later, the upper-level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the Caribbean Sea, allowing for an upper-level ridge, or high-pressure area, to form over the tropical wave. The change provided a favorable environment for tropical development, and an area of convection soon blossomed along the wave's axis. As the tropical wave approached the Lesser Antilles, a mid-level wind circulation formed within the deepest part of the convection, and a low-level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery. Although its low-level circulation was small and poorly defined, the system increased in organization enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Eleven at 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, located about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) southeast of Barbados.[3] Operationally, however, Hurricane Hunters did not confirm the depression's formation until nine hours later.[4] In its early stages, the depression moved west-northwestward between the islands of St. Vincent and St. Lucia under the influence of a strong ridge to its north. Compared to its appearance 24\u00a0hours before forming, the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection, although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized.[4] This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression's well-organized appearance on satellite imagery.[5] At 21:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h), corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). Based on these data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Iris, situated about 155\u00a0mi (249\u00a0km) south of the southern coast of Puerto Rico.[6] In post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that Iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.[3] Despite the storm's intensification and well-organized satellite appearance, the circulation failed to become better defined.[3] In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned the potential for the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed.[4] One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south.[6] Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on October\u00a06.[7] Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the Dominican Republic,[3] and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was the only factor impeding further development.[8] After Iris reached winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) early on October\u00a07, its intensity remained steady for about 24\u00a0hours.[3] During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an upper-level low.[9] By late on October\u00a07, the area of hurricane\u00a0force winds associated with Iris extended only 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) from its 16\u00a0mi (26\u00a0km) wide eye.[10][11] Early on October\u00a08, after turning west-southwestward away from the Greater Antilles, Iris began strengthening again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear and the NHC predicted peak winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) before the storm would hit Belize.[12] However, Iris instead began to rapidly intensify within the favorable conditions, going from 95 to 140\u00a0mph (153 to 225\u00a0km/h) in a 12-hour period on October\u00a08, making Iris a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; in the same duration, the minimum central pressure dropped 38\u00a0mbar (1.12\u00a0inHg).[3] While intensifying, the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls, with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km).[13] For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km), during Hurricane Wilma in 2005.[14] With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde into the center of Iris,[13] and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle, but within a few hours Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) just off Belize. At 02:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a09, it made landfall at peak intensity in Monkey River Town in the southern portion of Belize.[3] Operationally, it was assessed as having made landfall with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), though for an unknown reason this was lowered in post-analysis. Initially, Hurricane Iris was forecast to remain a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America and to re-intensify in the eastern Pacific Ocean; had it done so, it would have retained the name Iris.[13] Instead, the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of Guatemala, and within six hours of landfall, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Late on October\u00a09, within sixteen hours of landfall, the storm's circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico.[3] As the remnants approached the Pacific Ocean, a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of Iris. It gradually organized while continuing westward, developing into Tropical Storm Manuel; the new storm ultimately lasted until October\u00a018, before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.[15]"

Shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused.[16] In Belize, a hurricane warning was issued about 23\u00a0hours before Iris moved ashore.[3] A state of national emergency was declared on October\u00a08 as Hurricane Iris neared landfall. All emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts.[17] A mandatory evacuation was issued for Stann Creek and Toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands. The main hospital in Belize City was evacuated as a precaution and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order.[18] Overall, 11,380\u00a0people evacuated their homes in Belize,[19] including many in Belize City.[20] These evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll.[21] Hurricane Keith had struck the nation a year prior, preparing some citizens for what to expect.[20] Disaster response teams arrived the day after Iris was projected to make landfall. Pan American Health Organization staff were on standby in Belize, Guatemala and Honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm disease outbreaks.[18] On October\u00a08, the Government of Honduras declared a red alert for all northern regions, advising residents to expect \"extreme weather conditions\".[22] About 5,000\u00a0people in the country evacuated from their homes. To the north of Belize, officials in Mexico evacuated people from fishing villages and closed ports.[23]"

Because of its small diameter, Iris produced heavy damage only in a 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) area of southern Belize. In that region, the hurricane produced a storm surge of up to 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m),[3] with waves of over 13\u00a0ft (4.0\u00a0m) in height,[21] causing street flooding and some damage to the offshore cayes.[28] As it moved ashore, Iris damaged houses and schools in dozens of villages.[29] In 35\u00a0villages, the storm destroyed more than 95% of the buildings.[30] Its small size confined the worst damage largely to Toledo and Stann Creek districts, which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country.[21][31] The percentage of damaged houses was 72% in Toledo district and about 50% in Stann Creek,[32] leaving about 15,000\u00a0people homeless.[33] In both districts, the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies.[30] In the worst-affected areas, poor Mayan people living on farms lost much of what they owned.[30] At Placencia near the coast, about 80% of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage, with downed power poles in the streets.[21] About 90% of the houses in nearby Seine Bight were destroyed,[34] and where Iris made landfall, over 90% of the homes were destroyed throughout Monkey River Town.[21] The storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern Belize. Iris also damaged tourism facilities, including minor impact to the Maya ruins of Belize,[35] and damaged 20% of the hotel rooms in the country, accounting for $37\u00a0million in losses.[36] The remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.[37] In southern Belize, the storm's strong winds left crop damage, in some cases where the harvest had just begun. About 5,000 acres (2,000\u00a0ha) of bananas were destroyed, along with over 3,500 acres (1,400\u00a0ha) of rice, 3,000 acres (1,200\u00a0ha) of corn, and other crops to a lesser degree.[35] The storm also flooded fields and killed several livestock. The shrimp industry lost 25% of its catch,[35] partly due to contaminated waters.[38] Crop damage in Belize was estimated at $103\u00a0million,[36] mostly from banana losses.[35] Iris's strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest, with upwards of 40% of trees affected in some areas.[35] This disrupted the habitats of several animals, and it is likely that many of the howler monkeys near Monkey River were killed.[39] The storm's strong waves eroded the beach, although marine effects were much less than those of Hurricane Keith in the previous year.[35] Nevertheless, there were reports of fish die-offs after the storm, possibly from low oxygen due to too much decaying matter.[39] Nationwide, Iris damaged or destroyed 3,718\u00a0homes,[40] directly affecting a total of 21,568\u00a0people,[31] or 8.5% of the total population.[41] The storm damaged or destroyed 31\u00a0schools and 17\u00a0health facilities,[31] along with 21\u00a0government buildings.[42] There was about $25\u00a0million in damage to the transportation sector, including highways and bridges.[36] Iris killed 24\u00a0people in and around the country,[43] including the victims of the Wave Dancer shipwreck.[44] Overall damage was estimated at $250\u00a0million,[45] making it the most damaging storm in the country since Hurricane Hattie in 1961.[37]"

By the day after the storm struck, the airport in Belize City had been reopened, and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal.[34] Residents in the southern part of the country lost access to fresh water, forcing them to drink unclean water.[30] Officials sent medical teams to southern Belize in the most affected areas.[21] The Belmopan Red Cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money, clothing, and food for storm victims.[34] The Red Cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7,000\u00a0people.[44] By October\u00a019, most roads in southern Belize were reopened. The Belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs, and officials authorized spending $1.2\u00a0million to rebuild damaged homes. To assist the farmers who lost crops, the Belize government provided 18,000\u00a0lb (8,200\u00a0kg) of maize seeds, as well as fertilizer.[32] After the storm, the World Food Programme and the Belize Red Cross collectively provided food for the 9,000\u00a0families in need of subsidence.[54] By October\u00a031, the Red Cross had provided blankets, tarps, and hygienic supplies to 4,800\u00a0people severely affected by the storm.[55] Homes were gradually repaired, and crop production returned to normal by early 2002. Around Christmas of 2001, the Belize Red Cross provided presents to school children in 14\u00a0villages affected by the storm.[40] The lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22% in 2002, although sales gradually recovered.[56] The government of Belize issued an appeal to the international community for assistance in the days following Iris's landfall,[57] and various countries provided aid.[34] The United Kingdom sent a helicopter to assist in damage assessment and a crew to clean the water. The United States also sent a crew for damage assessment and donated plastic sheeting.[58] Although sustaining significant damage, the Government of Guatemala deployed a working team with members from throughout the country to assist in recovery in Belize.[59] Mexico sent blankets, mattresses, food, and water, as well as a medical team.[58] The Japanese government sent tents and blankets,[60] and the Chinese government donated 500\u00a0lb (230\u00a0kg) of rice and dried fruits.[58] Various United Nations departments donated about $225,000.[34] The American victims of the Wave Dancer boat wreck were flown back to the Richmond, Virginia area following the storm.[26] The insurance company covering the boat reached a $4\u00a0million settlement, which was disbursed among the survivors and the victims' families.

        "content": " Hurricane Inez was a powerful Category 5 major hurricane[nb 1] that affected the Caribbean, Bahamas, Florida, and Mexico, killing over 1,000 people in 1966. It was the first storm on record to affect all of those areas. It originated from a tropical wave over Africa, and became a tropical depression by September\u00a021. It moved slowly westward, initially failing to intensify much; it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Inez on September\u00a024. The storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the French overseas region of Guadeloupe on September\u00a027. Inez severely damaged the island's banana and sugar crops, and thousands of homes were damaged, leaving 10,000\u00a0people homeless. Damage on Guadeloupe was estimated at $50\u00a0million,[nb 2] and there were 40\u00a0deaths. After entering the Caribbean, Inez briefly weakened before restrengthening, attaining peak sustained winds of 165\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a028, eventually making landfall at that intensity in the Dominican Republic. That day a hurricane hunters flight reported a gust of 197\u00a0mph (317\u00a0km/h), which was the highest recorded at the time. Continuing westward, Inez made landfall as a small hurricane on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. There, the storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800\u00a0houses. Nationwide, there were about 100\u00a0deaths and $12\u00a0million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000\u00a0people were killed, and 60,000\u00a0people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35\u00a0million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send aid for the first time in nearly ten years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September\u00a030. In the country, 125,000\u00a0people were forced to evacuate, and there were three deaths and $20\u00a0million in damage. The hurricane moved slowly over Cuba for two days before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. It was expected to continue out to sea, although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path. In the Bahamas, heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding, which killed five people and left $15.5\u00a0million in damage. Hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the Florida Keys, where 160\u00a0homes and 190\u00a0trailers were damaged. Salt spray damaged crops in the region, and there was $5\u00a0million in damage and four deaths. In the Straits of Florida, Inez capsized a boat of Cuban refugees, killing 45\u00a0people. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig, killing 11\u00a0people. The hurricane threatened the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and although it remained offshore, Inez produced flooding and caused some power outages. At its final landfall, Inez flooded portions of Tamaulipas and cut off roads to Tampico. About 84,000\u00a0people were left homeless, and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500\u00a0houses. Damage was estimated at $104\u00a0million, and there were 74\u00a0deaths in Mexico."

        "content": "The origins of Inez were from a tropical wave that formed over the Sahara in central Africa on September\u00a015 from the monsoon. It moved westward in the prevailing winds, exiting the west coast of Africa on September\u00a018. The precursor to Inez was a disturbance along the northern portion of the wave,[2] which was considered a tropical depression by September\u00a018 in the annual tropical cyclone summary. Tracked by satellites, the system moved to the west-southwest,[3] and was officially classified a tropical depression on September\u00a021 about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.[4] The system remained weak as it turned toward the west-northwest. A Hurricane Hunters flight indicated some intensification in the system, prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Inez, located about 800\u00a0mi (1,300\u00a0km) east of Martinique.[3] With warm water temperatures, the storm developed a circular area of convection over its center.[2] Inez slowed while curving westward around a ridge to its north and quickly intensified,[3] reaching hurricane status on September\u00a026.[4] On September\u00a027, Inez strengthened to reach winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h), making it a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[4] Later that day, it moved directly over the island of Guadeloupe. At the time, Inez was a small cyclone, with hurricane-force winds extending 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) from the center;[3] meteorologists labeled it as a \"micro-hurricane... because of its characteristic small, tight cloud structure and strong maximum surface wind.\"[2] Its structure became disrupted by the island, and the central pressure rose from 961 to 970\u00a0mbar (28.4 to 28.6\u00a0inHg), indicative of weakening. However, Inez re-intensified after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, reaching a minimum pressure of 927\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg) south of Puerto Rico on September\u00a028. The Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of 197\u00a0mph (317\u00a0km/h) at a height of 8,000\u00a0ft (2,400\u00a0m), the strongest winds recorded for the storm. The same flight estimated surface winds between 150 and 175\u00a0mph (241 and 282\u00a0km/h) near the center.[3] The peak intensity listed in the HURDAT, the Atlantic hurricane database, is 165\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h), making Inez a Category 5 hurricane.[4] In 2017, a preliminary re-analysis conducted as part of the ongoing Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project raised Inez's peak intensity from its original 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[5] This re-analysis has been officially accepted and included in HURDAT. While near peak intensity, Inez was located about 160\u00a0mi (260\u00a0km) southwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the eye was tracked by radar from the island. Its increasing outflow caused Tropical Storm Judith to the east over the central Atlantic to dissipate. On September\u00a029, the small but powerful hurricane made landfall on the Barahona Peninsula, and quickly weakened over land. It briefly moved offshore and struck the southern peninsula of Haiti near Jacmel. The eye emerged into the Windward Passage near L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, although severely weakened. The pressure rose to 987\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg),[3] and the winds decreased to 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) over land. However, Inez quickly re-intensified over water, reaching winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a030 before striking southeastern Cuba near Guant\u00e1namo Bay.[4] When Inez was over Cuba, forecasters had difficulty in predicting the storm's future; it was expected that the hurricane would move to the north off the east coast of the United States due to a weakness in the ridge to the north. The hurricane drifted west-northwestward within light steering currents, weakening over the high terrain but later moving offshore the southern coast of Cuba. While over water, the eye reorganized, and the cyclone maintained hurricane intensity. Inez eventually turned to a northward drift over central Cuba and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on October\u00a02.[3] Shortly after exiting Cuba into the Atlantic, Inez weakened into a tropical storm, and was moving northeastward through the Bahamas about 24\u00a0hours later than forecast.[3] At the time, the storm was expected to continue to the northeast around the Bermuda high.[2] With little outflow and a large, diffuse circulation, Inez did not restrengthen much despite otherwise favorable conditions,[3] potentially due to a nearby trough.[2] The movement slowed, and the 1966 hurricane summary remarked that \"Inez probably became nearly stationary closer to the United States mainland than any other storm.\" On October\u00a03, Inez turned to the west-southwest as another ridge strengthened over the western Gulf of Mexico. Over the subsequent few days, the eye moved directly over the Florida Keys from Key Largo to Key West and continued through the Gulf of Mexico while slowly intensifying. On October\u00a07, Inez brushed the northern coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula with hurricane-force winds. By then, the ridge had begun to weaken, allowing the hurricane to turn more west-northwestward.[3] On October\u00a08, Inez attained a secondary peak intensity of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h),[4] with a pressure of 948\u00a0mbar (28.0\u00a0inHg). Briefly threatening the coastline of Texas, Inez turned to the southwest after the ridge again strengthened. On October\u00a010, the hurricane made its final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico. It weakened rapidly over the region's high terrain, dissipating on October\u00a011.[3] The unusual track of Inez marked the first time on record that a tropical cyclone affected the Lesser and Greater Antilles, Bahamas, Florida, and Mexico.[3] The Associated Press described Inez as the \"first to strike the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in many years.\"[6] It was also the first to move across the Gulf of Mexico without turning to the north so late in the season, and the 65\u00a0advisories issued by the NHC was the highest number at the time. The path taken by Inez was compared to Hurricane Betsy in 1965, which also slowed and moved erratically due to a strong ridge.[3] Forecasters had difficulty with the hurricane because of its unusual path, as well as the inability to fly the Hurricane Hunters into Inez while it was over Cuba.[7]"

Pan American World Airways canceled flights to the region.[8] When Inez was near peak intensity, the NHC warned residents in southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic of the danger posed by the hurricane. The agency emphasized that the eye was visible on radar to calm tension of an unexpected change in track. In general, hurricane warnings were issued 24\u00a0hours in advance, with the exception of southeastern Florida due to the hurricane's slowing track.[3] Overall, 250,000\u00a0people evacuated along the path of Inez.[9] At Guant\u00e1namo Bay, officials ordered residents at the naval base to evacuate to storm shelters. Large ships at the port there were moved to Jamaica before the storm struck.[10] Throughout eastern Cuba, Premier Fidel Castro ordered about 125,000\u00a0people to evacuate in low-lying areas, mostly in Oriente Province.[11] United States Air Force tracking stations in the Bahamas were secured or moved to safer locations. Residents in the Florida Keys boarded up windows and store fronts,[12] and hundreds of people evacuated to a shelter in Key West. In southeastern Florida, government offices and schools closed.[13] Along the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, about 15,000\u00a0people were evacuated from the coastal city of Progreso,[6] in a region that seldom experiences hurricanes.[14] In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after evacuating workers from an oil platform about 65\u00a0mi (105\u00a0km) south-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, in otherwise calm conditions; 11\u00a0people died, including the pilot.[15] When Inez was approaching its final landfall, the United States Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Brownsville to Port Isabel, Texas, with gale warnings northward to Corpus Christi. At least 2,000\u00a0people evacuated from Port Isabel alone,[16] and many shrimp boats were secured.[17] In the Tampico area where Inez made its final landfall, over 31,000\u00a0people evacuated to higher grounds.[18]"

Rain on the island reached 6.5\u00a0in (170\u00a0mm).[3] The high winds destroyed the roofs of thousands of houses, leaving 10,000\u00a0people homeless. There was heavy damage to both the banana and sugar crops, described as \"flattened\" by the St. Petersburg Times.[19] The storm flooded a power plant in Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre and downed many power lines, causing power outages.[20] The Associated Press described the hurricane as having \"virtually leveled a whole district of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre\".[21] Hundreds of people were injured, although because of damaged hospitals and the power outage, most only received makeshift treatment.[22] Inez left 40\u00a0people dead and $50\u00a0million in damage on the island.[3][12] Strong winds also affected nearby Antigua,[8] and damage was reported from that island to Dominica.[23] In the United States Virgin Islands, a station on St. Croix reported 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) gusts. When Inez passed south of Puerto Rico, its rainbands produced gusty winds along the island's southern coast, reaching 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) in Pe\u00f1uelas. On Isla de Mona, wind gusts were estimated at 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[3] Flooding occurred in southern Puerto Rico, and high winds damaged 20\u00a0houses.[21] Hurricane Inez struck the Dominican Republic near peak intensity.[3] Along the Barahona Peninsula, more than 800\u00a0homes were destroyed, and nationwide about 5,000\u00a0people were left homeless. There was heavy damage to the country's cotton industry,[22] as well as the coffee, sugar cane, and cocoa crops along the Barahona Peninsula. In the capital city of Santo Domingo, heavy rains flooded hundreds of homes along the Ozama River, forcing thousands to evacuate.[19] High seas there damaged a portion of a seawall. Many rivers along the Barahona Peninsula were also flooded.[20] Throughout the country, Inez killed about 100\u00a0people,[3] including 55 in Juancho,[22] and left $12\u00a0million in damage.[3] In neighboring Haiti, high winds downed power lines and radio towers, which cut outside communication. High rainfall led to flash flooding between mountain ranges,[22] in a location nicknamed the \"valley of death\"; there, the Weather Bureau remarked that \"local winds... may well have exceeded 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h)\".[23] Thousands of homes were either destroyed or lost their roof.[20] The Haitian government reported over 1,000\u00a0deaths in the weeks after the storm. The United States government reported that the hurricane \"killed no more than 50\" in Haiti, and \"nor was there a real emergency,\" due to president Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier misusing previous aid.[24] The U.S. assessment was incorrect, as the 1966 annual tropical cyclone summary in the Monthly Weather Review indicated 750\u00a0deaths in Haiti,[3] mostly in Jacmel. President Duvalier considered the hurricane the \"worst storm... since the 1920s.\"[12] In the country, 1,000\u00a0people were injured and 60,000 were left homeless, and damage was estimated at $20.35\u00a0million.[25] Throughout Hispaniola, about 1,500\u00a0people were seriously injured, and many people were still recovering from Hurricane Flora in 1963.[23] A station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay reported winds of 138\u00a0mph (222\u00a0km/h) when Inez moved ashore in Cuba, and rainfall reached 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm).[3] Tides were 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) above normal there.[23] The hurricane knocked down trees and power lines, and many roofs were damaged on the naval base.[10] In the city of Guant\u00e1namo, the hurricane destroyed 500\u00a0houses.[14] High winds heavily damaged the country's sugar and coffee crops.[11] When Inez re-entered the Gulf of Mexico, it threatened northwestern Cuba and produced 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of rainfall. High waves and strong winds affected the coastline.[23] In La Habana Province, flooding forced 21,000\u00a0people to evacuate,[14] mostly in low-lying areas. One building was destroyed in Havana.[26] Nationwide, Inez injured at least 38\u00a0people,[12] and caused five deaths,[3] three of which occurred after Inez moved southwestward from the Florida Keys.[14] Damage totaled $20\u00a0million.[3] In the Bahamas, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall over three days, reaching 14.31\u00a0in (363\u00a0mm) in Nassau. There, Inez spawned a small tornado that produced winds of over 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h),[3] killing one person and injuring three. High tides flooded portions of Nassau.[23] Two waterspouts were reported in Freeport. Wind gusts in the archipelago reached 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) at West End, Grand Bahama, and sustained winds reached 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) in Freeport.

Ten of the passengers escaped on a damaged raft, but the only survivor was the captain;[27] 45\u00a0people died due to the boat capsizing.[3] High waves also disabled three ships and beached a Coast Guard boat near Miami;[13] a lifeguard and people on the beach assisted in rescuing the crew of nine Coast Guardsmen amid rough seas.[23] When the hurricane moved across the Florida Keys, it dropped light rainfall, reaching 4.80\u00a0in (122\u00a0mm) near Kendall.[28] Inez was considered a \"dry hurricane\", and about 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) of the precipitation that fell was largely in the form of sea water spray.[29] Light rainfall occurred in Miami, where strong winds damaged crops due to salt spray onto local vegetation.[30] During its passage, Inez produced above normal tides, reaching 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) above normal on Big Pine Key. Inez produced strong winds while it was intensifying,[3] and the strongest winds occurred after the passage of the eye.[23] The highest sustained winds were 98\u00a0mph (158\u00a0km/h) on Plantation Key, and peak gusts were 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) in the Dry Tortugas. On Big Pine Key, sustained winds were estimated at 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h). On the Florida mainland, the highest gusts were 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h) at Flamingo.[3] The winds damaged smaller tree limbs and uprooted some trees. About 20% of the local avocado crop was blown off trees, although most was salvageable. Winds and salt spray severely damaged vegetables in southern Dade County, including up to 80% losses of tomatoes in some farms.[29] Power outages were reported in Key West.[13] In the Florida Keys, the hurricane damaged 160\u00a0homes and 190\u00a0trailers.[26] Statewide, damage totaled $5\u00a0million,[3] and there were four deaths; three were elderly people who died of heart attacks while installing shutters, and the fourth was a teenager who was swept by large surf.[13] Inez was the last hurricane to threaten the Miami metropolitan area until Hurricane David in 1979,[31] and the last hurricane to strike the Florida Keys until Hurricane Kate in 1985.[32] When Inez was making its final landfall in Mexico, its outer circulation reached southern Texas, producing winds of 22\u00a0mph (35\u00a0km/h) and trace rainfall. Tides reached 3.1\u00a0ft (0.94\u00a0m) above normal in Corpus Christi,[3] and 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) waves caused $5,000 in damage to piers.[33]"

High waves destroyed a dock in Telchac Puerto.[6] Heavy rainfall flooded streets in M\u00e9rida, although damage was not severe.[34] At the hurricane's final landfall, a station in Tampico reported sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 127\u00a0mph (204\u00a0km/h) before communications were cut. Inez dropped heavy rainfall upon moving ashore, causing flooding. In Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas, rainfall totaled 10.12\u00a0in (257\u00a0mm).[3] In northeastern Mexico, more than 3,000\u00a0people were stranded by flooding after dozens of rivers and streams rose above their banks, forcing some families to hold onto trees.[18] The floods washed out roads around Tampico and cut communications and the water supply.[35] In Tamaulipas, 15\u00a0people died while trying to deliver supplies to residents along the Tamesi River.[36] Throughout the country, the hurricane left about 84,000\u00a0people homeless,[37] and destroyed at least 2,500\u00a0houses.[38] Agricultural damage totaled over $80\u00a0million, and property damage was estimated at $24\u00a0million in Tampico and Ciudad Madero alone.[18] Overall, Inez killed 74\u00a0people in Mexico.[37]"

Charles de Gaulle visited the island, and the French population unified to provide assistance to the island.[39] In late October 1966, the French government set up a relief fund for Guadeloupe totaling $34\u00a0million (\u20a3170\u00a0million francs).[40] The government initiated plans to rebuild the island to withstand the winds of strong hurricanes.[39] The United States Agency for International Development flew 20,000\u00a0pounds of blankets and clothing to the island.[19] Due to the heavy damage in Hispaniola, VMM-365, a United States Marine Corps helicopter division, spent 454\u00a0hours and flew 740\u00a0sorties to provide 186,676\u00a0tons of relief supplies to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The division also helped evacuate 142\u00a0hospital patients.[41] The Dominican Air Force also assisted in transporting injured people from outlying areas to Santo Domingo.[22] The country deployed 5,000\u00a0troops to send food, medicine, and clothing to the storm-damaged areas in the interior,[19] as well as Barahona Peninsula.[20] The Holy See sent $2,000 to assist the residents affected by the storm in Haiti.[25] After a nearly ten year boycott due to the actions of Haitian president Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, the United States provided a $1.3\u00a0million loan to the country to help rebuild infrastructure and provide education. Industrialist Clint Murchison gave $50,000 in flour and food from a mill he owned in the country.[42] The United States also sent vaccines and 4,360\u00a0pounds of food.[43] In Cuba, sailors on the USS America (CV-66) spent about 1,700\u00a0hours to assist Guant\u00e1namo Bay in recovery.[44] The sole survivor of the sinking boat carrying Cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal. The man was held responsible for the 44\u00a0boat deaths and was quickly executed by the Cuban government.[45] The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the Straits of Florida.[27] In the United States, the price for lettuce and tomatoes rose due to Inez's crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California.[46] The country's military sent helicopters and planes to join the Mexican Air Force,[37] as well as trucks by land,[18] to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas.[47] In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal.[37] Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.[48] As a result of the storm's disastrous effects, the name Inez was retired, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.[49] It was replaced with Isabel for the 1970 season.[50]"

        "content": " Hurricane Nadine was an erratic Category 1 hurricane that became the fourth-longest-lived Atlantic hurricane on record. As the fourteenth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Nadine developed from a tropical wave traveling west of Cape Verde on September\u00a010. On the following day, it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine. After initially tracking northwestward, Nadine turned northward, well away from any landmass. Early on September\u00a015, Nadine reached hurricane status as it was curving eastward. Soon after, an increase in vertical wind shear weakened Nadine and by September 16 it was back to a tropical storm. On the following day, the storm began moving northeastward and threatened the Azores but late on September\u00a019, Nadine veered east-southeastward before reaching the islands. Nonetheless, the storm produced tropical storm force winds on a few islands. On September\u00a021, the storm curved south-southeastward while south of the Azores. Later that day, Nadine transitioned into a extratropical low pressure area. Due to favorable conditions, the remnants of Nadine regenerated into a tropical cyclone on September\u00a024. After re-developing, the storm executed a cyclonic loop and meandered slowly across the eastern Atlantic. Eventually, Nadine turned south-southwestward, at which time it became nearly stationary. By September\u00a028, the storm curved northwestward and re-strengthened into a hurricane. The tenacious cyclone intensified further and peaked with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a030. By the following day, however, Nadine weakened back to a 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) tropical storm, as conditions became increasingly unfavorable. Strong wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures significantly weakened the storm. Nadine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a03, and merged with an approaching cold front northeast of the Azores soon after. The remnants of Nadine passed through the Azores on October\u00a04 and again brought relatively strong winds to the islands."

        "content": "A large tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa, on September\u00a07.[1] The system passed south of Cape Verde on September\u00a08, bringing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.[2] Around that time, the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48\u00a0hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September\u00a09, which further increased convective activity.[1] The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September\u00a010.[3] Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, while the storm was about 885 miles (1,424\u00a0km) west of Cape Verde.[1][4] Although thunderstorm activity was initially minimal around the center of circulation, a convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized.[4] Late on September\u00a010, convection began to increase slightly near the center, but because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm.[5] However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September\u00a011, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later that day, the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012.[1]"

Later that day, sustained winds reached 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[7][8] By early on September\u00a013, convective banding wrapped almost completely around the center and cloud tops reached temperatures as low as \u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221280\u00a0\u00b0C). However, because microwave satellite data could not determine if an eye had developed, Nadine's intensity was held at 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h)\u2014\u2013just below the threshold of hurricane status.[9] The National Hurricane Center noted that \"the window for Nadine to strengthen may be closing\", citing computer model consensus of an increase in wind shear and little change in structure.[10] The storm then began experiencing moderate southwesterly wind shear on September\u00a013, generated by a mid- to upper-level trough and a shear axis a few hundred miles to the west of Nadine. As a result, the storm struggled to develop an eye and the center became more difficult to locate.[11] Although the storm was disorganized, a scatterometer pass indicated tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 230 miles (370\u00a0km). The satellite appearance of Nadine became more ragged by September\u00a014. Despite this, the storm remained just below hurricane status and the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of intensification if wind shear decreased in the next few days. Nadine turned northward on September\u00a014 as it tracked along the periphery of a subtropical ridge.[12] Soon after, a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass indicated that core convection began re-organizing. However, because wind shear displaced the mid-level circulation to the north of the low-level circulation, Nadine was not upgraded to a hurricane.[13] Because Nadine would approach colder sea surface temperatures, significant strengthening was considered unlikely.[13] Due to an increase in satellite intensity estimates and re-organization, Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014. Six hours later, Nadine reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[1] Satellite imagery indicated that a ragged eye feature was attempting to develop late on September\u00a015.[14]"

The strongest showers and thunderstorms that remained were in a band to the west and northwest of Nadine's center. [21] Nadine threatened the Azores while moving northeastward and then northward between September\u00a018 and September\u00a019, though a blocking ridge prevented the storm from approaching closer to the islands. Its closest approach to the Azores was about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) south-southwest of Flores Island on September\u00a019.[1] The storm then re-curved east-southeastward on September\u00a020, after the ridge weakened and the mid- to upper-level trough deepened.[1] By late on September\u00a021, much of the remaining deep convection was composed of only a ragged convective band with warming cloud tops.[22] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center re-classified Nadine as a subtropical storm at 2100 UTC on September 21, due to an above-average, asymmetrical wind field and an upper-level low pressure area near the center.[23] However, post-season analysis concluded that Nadine degenerated into a non-tropical low pressure area three hours earlier.[1]"

        "content": "Early on September\u00a022, the National Hurricane Center noted that regeneration into a tropical cyclone was a distinct possibility.[24] The remnant low pressure area soon moved over warmer seas and a low-shear environment, causing deep convection to re-develop. Thus, Nadine became a tropical storm at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023. Another blocking ridge over the Azores forced Nadine to move west-northwestward on September\u00a024, causing it to execute a small cyclonic loop. Although winds increased to 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), the storm weakened again and decreased to a 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) tropical storm on September\u00a025.[1] Despite this regression, satellite imagery indicated that Nadine developed an eye-like feature.[25] However, the National Hurricane Center later noted that it was a cloud-free region near the center of the storm.[26] By September\u00a026, Nadine curved south-southwestward to southwestward around the southeastern portion of a mid- to upper-level ridge over the western Atlantic.[1] After minimal change in strength for several days, Nadine finally began to intensify on September\u00a027, due to sea surface temperatures warmer than 79\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C). At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a028, Nadine re-strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[1] Around that time, satellite imagery indicated that the storm re-developed an eye feature.[27] After becoming disorganized, the National Hurricane Center erroneously downgraded Nadine to a tropical storm on September\u00a029[28] before upgrading it to a hurricane again six hours later.[29] Nadine had actually remained a hurricane and was intensifying further.[1] Winds increased to 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a030, after the eye became more distinct.[30] At 1200\u00a0UTC, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 978\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg).[1] After peak intensity, Nadine began weakening once again and deteriorated to a tropical storm at 1200\u00a0UTC, on October\u00a01.[1] Northwesterly winds began to increase on October\u00a03, after an upper-level trough that was causing low wind shear moved eastward.[31] A few hours later, the low-level center became partially exposed,[32] before becoming fully separated from the convection by 1500\u00a0UTC.[32] Due to strong wind shear and cold sea surface temperatures, showers and thunderstorms rapidly diminished, and by late on October\u00a03, Nadine became devoid of any deep convection.[33] At 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, Nadine transitioned into an extratropical low-pressure area, while about 195 miles (314\u00a0km) southwest of the central Azores. The low rapidly moved northeastward, degenerated into a trough of low pressure, and was absorbed by a cold front later that day.[1]"

At 1000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, a tropical storm watch was issued for the islands of Flores and Corvo. Although the tropical storm watch was discontinued at 2100\u00a0UTC, a tropical storm warning was implemented at that time for the islands of Corvo, Faial, Flores, Graciosa, Pico, S\u00e3o Jorge, and Terceira. At 1500\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019, a tropical storm warning was also issued for S\u00e3o Miguel and Santa Maria. All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on September\u00a021. After re-generating, Nadine posed a threat to the Azores again, which resulted in a tropical storm watch for the entire archipelago at 1500\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01. Nine hours later, 0000\u00a0UTC on the following day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. After Nadine became extratropical, the warning was discontinued.[1] On the storm's second approach toward the Azores, schools were closed and flight were cancelled.[44] Late on September\u00a020, Flores reported a wind gust of 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h).[45] A sustained wind speed of 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a gust up to 81\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) were reported at Horta on the island of Faial, as Nadine passed to the south on September\u00a021. During the second Azores impact on October\u00a04, the highest sustained wind speed reported was 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h) on S\u00e3o Miguel, while the strongest gust was 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) at the Wind Power Plant on Santa Maria.[1] On Pico Island, the pavement of the sports hall of the primary and secondary school in Lajes do Pico was destroyed.[46] The remnants of Nadine produced a plume of moisture that dropped heavy rainfall over the United Kingdom, particularly in England and Wales, reaching 5.12\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) at Ravensworth in the former. The rains flooded houses and disrupted roads and rails.[47][48] Nadine lasted a total of\u00a024 days as a tropical, subtropical, and post-tropical cyclone, including 22.25\u00a0days as a tropical system. This makes it the fourth longest-lasting Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, only behind the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane at 28\u00a0days, Hurricane Ginger in 1971 at 27.25 days, and Hurricane Inga in 1969 at 24.75 days. When only counting time spent as a tropical storm or hurricane \u2013 20.75\u00a0days \u2013 Nadine is the third longest-lasting, behind only Hurricane Ginger in 1971 and the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane.[1] When Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014, it marked the third-earliest forming eighth hurricane, behind only an unnamed system in 1893 and Ophelia in 2005.[49]"

Three cities across southern Ontario declared a state of emergency. At least twelve people were killed, mostly by falling trees.[8] Power outages affected an estimated 1.1 million customers, and thousands were still without power a week after the storm.[9] Hydro Ottawa described the damage dealt to its power distribution system as more severe than the 1998 ice storm. The storm was the sixth-costliest event in Canadian history.[10] According to an estimate published on June 15 by the firm Catastrophe Indices and Quantification (CatIQ), the insured damage would amount to C$875 million, that is, C$720 million in Ontario and C$155 million in Quebec.

The historic range has likely shifted northward, due to climate change[11] Typically, derechos anywhere in this area can form from late spring through the summer months. These derechos usually occur when a hot and muggy air mass covers the Midwest and Ohio Valley, the stronger derechos in this region tend to develop on the northern boundary between the hot, humid air and cooler, drier air where there is also an elevated mixed layer (EML).[13][14][11] Most derechos in Canada are progressive derechos which skirt the northern edge of a heat wave high pressure area, or hybrid derechos which are similar to progressive derechos, but arise ahead of a cold front.[14] Tornadoes which accompany these types of derechos are usually Quasi-Linear Convective System (QLCS) tornadoes which are embedded in the bow echo.[14][15]"

The wind of these storms snapped some trees, mostly in St. Clair County, but this cluster of thunderstorms had not yet formed a bow echo.[24] The derecho developed near Sarnia at 9:30 am. By 10:45 am when the storms hit London, the derecho had coalesced into a bow front roughly 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) wide[25] and had developed wind speeds of close to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph). The bow front continued to widen and intensify east of London, roughly following a corridor between Highway 401 and Highway 7 in Ontario, and then along the Autoroute 20 in Quebec. The storm moved east at an average 100 km/h, striking Toronto at 1:00 pm, Ottawa at 3:50 pm, Montreal at 5:30 pm, and Quebec City at 6:30 pm.[26][25] The weather changed very rapidly as the derecho approached.

Pakhar was also located in a very favorable environment such as low wind shear along with warm sea-surface temperatures of 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] Pakhar slightly intensified after a burst of deep convection developed just prior of making landfall over in Luzon in the province of Aurora.[10][11] However, due to land reaction from the archipelago and the inclusion of a weakened convective structure, Pakhar weakened to minimal tropical storm intensity.[12] After emerging to the South China Sea on August 26, Pakhar began to re-intensify as the storm entered in an area of a much lower amount of wind shear.[13] However six hours later, Pakhar maintained its intensity after its LLCC became exposed and its deep convective banding became fragmented.[14] By 18:00 UTC of the same day, the JMA upgraded Pakhar's intensity as a severe tropical storm,[15] despite its central convection remaining disorganized.[16] The PAGASA also stated that the storm had already exited their area of responsibility, issuing its final bulletin on Pakhar.[17] By 00:00 UTC of August 27, Pakhar reached its maximum intensity of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) with a minimum barometric pressure of 985 hPa while making landfall over in South China in the city of Taishan.[18] The JTWC assessed Pakhar's maximum intensity slightly higher with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph), however.[1] Three hours later, the JTWC issued their final advisory.[19] By 06:00 UTC, Pakhar began to rapidly weaken as the JMA downgraded Pakhar to a tropical storm.[20] The JMA tracked the system until 18:00 UTC of the same day when it fully dissipated.[21]"

As soon as the PAGASA began issuing advisories on the storm, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal#1 was raised over most of Cagayan Valley and northern Aurora during August 24.[22] Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal #2 was also raised in the same areas with the inclusion of the Cordillera Administrative Region while Signal #1 was extended to the Ilocos Region and Bicol Region.[23] By August 25, a total of 16 provinces were placed in a warning as they were located within a 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) radius of the storm.[24] Classes were suspended for all levels over in Albay, Bicol due to possible threats of flooding and landslides on August 25.[25] The government also announced the suspension of classes for August 26 over in Metro Manila and some parts of Central Luzon and Calabarzon.[26] The province of Ilocos Sur declared the suspension of work in all public and private services that same day.[27] The Office of the Civil Defense warned residents of low-lying areas in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela of potential flooding.[28] Kennon Road in Benguet were closed due to the threat of landslides. Hiking, trekking, and caving were suspended over in mountainous areas in the Mountain Province.[29] Heavy rainfall from Pakhar caused the Magat Dam to overflow, which also submerged several bridges over in Isabela.[30] A total of 11 flights to Hong Kong and South China from Ninoy Aquino International Airport were canceled due to the storm.[31] Eight domestic flights were canceled throughout August 25.[27] According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, 3,397 people were affected by the storm with 17 reports of flooding.[27] The cities of Balatan, San Fernando and Ifugao suffered power outages throughout the storm. Overall, no casualties have been reported and damages were relatively minor.[27] Recorded damages in Aurora province have reached PH\u20b141.27 million (US$808 thousand).[32]"

The Home Affairs Department of Hong Kong opened 27 temporary shelters while the China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui was closed temporarily. Ferry services across the Pearl River Delta were also suspended.[42] Part of the Stonecutters Bridge was closed due to strong winds which made vehicles taller than 1.5 metres and motorcycles barred from using the bridge.[42] Moreover, 51 people sought medical treatment in public hospitals and 231 people have sought refuge in shelters.[37] An orange typhoon warning was also raised over in the provinces of Shenzhen and Guangzhou while red warning was raised in Zhuhai.[34][35] Furthermore, Hainan had a total of 24,124 fishing boats put into harbor.[43] All of the water bus service was paused in Pearl River Delta.[44]\nThe city of Taishan had recorded gusts of 119\u00a0km/h (74\u00a0mph). Pakhar drenched the Pearl River Delta region with the city of Shenzhen having total rainfall of 162\u00a0mm (6.4\u00a0in). The National Meteorological Center of China had forecast torrential rain over in the South China provinces from August 27\u201328, especially Guangdong and Guangxi could reach up to 1,800\u00a0mm (71\u00a0in) of rain.[45] A total of 9,000 emergency repairers, 97 emergency generator vehicles and 1,691 generators are in place in Guangxi and the Yangtze River flood control headquarters dispatched personnel for the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.[41] A total of 83,000 people were affected by the storm, along with 14,000 people in which were evacuated over in the four main affected regions of Guandong, Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan.[46] One person died from a traffic incident while 62 were injured,[42] while an additional two were confirmed hours later.[47] Overall, 12 people were killed by Pakhar,[46] and damages have reached CN\u00a5760 million (US$114.4 million).[48]"

        "content": " Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. Janet was also the first named storm to cause 1,000 deaths and the first Category 5 storm name to be retired. The eleventh tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the year,[nb 1] Janet formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21. Moving westward across the Caribbean Sea, Janet fluctuated in intensity, but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h). The intense hurricane later made landfall at that intensity near Chetumal, Mexico on September 28. After weakening over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, it moved into the Bay of Campeche, where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near Veracruz on September 29. Janet quickly weakened over Mexico's mountainous terrain before dissipating on September 30. In its developmental stages, Janet caused $7.8 million in damage to the Lesser Antilles and 189 deaths in the Grenadines and Barbados.[nb 2] While Janet was in the central Caribbean Sea, a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost with all hands. This remains the only such loss which has occurred in association with an Atlantic hurricane. A Category 5 upon landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Janet caused severe devastation in areas of Quintana Roo and British Honduras. Only five buildings in Chetumal, Mexico remained intact after the storm, and an estimated 500 deaths occurred in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. At Janet's second landfall near Veracruz, significant river flooding ensued, worsening effects caused by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the month. The floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326 people in the Tampico area, leading to the largest Mexican relief operation ever executed by the United States. Janet's landfall as a Category 5 hurricane on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula was the first recorded instance of a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic making landfall on a continental mainland; prior to Janet, landfalls of Category 5 intensity were only known to have taken place on islands.[2] Janet's minimum barometric pressure, recorded in Chetumal, was at the time the second-lowest-recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. At least 1,023 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8 million in damages."

        "content": "A weak tropical disturbance was first reported by the Air France and Iberia airlines east of the Lesser Antilles early on September 21. Although it was speculated that the disturbance originated from a tropical wave near Cape Verde, the Weather Bureau considered the system too weak to be detected due to a lack of reports from the islands.[3] At 1800 UTC on September 21, while it was located 350 miles (560\u00a0km) east-southeast of Martinique,[4][5] the disturbance became sufficiently organized for the Weather Bureau to classify it as Tropical Storm Janet, the tenth named storm of the season.[5] Upon classification, Janet quickly intensified as it moved to the west.[4][6] On September 22, Janet attained hurricane strength, and proceeded to intensify rapidly as it moved westward across the Windward Islands.[3] By 1200 UTC that day, Janet already attained Category 3 hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h), before stalling in intensification.[4] Shortly after 1700 UTC on September 22, the eye of Janet passed south of Barbados as a Category 1 Hurricane.[7] A reconnaissance flight into the hurricane discovered that the Hurricane Janet's eye measured only 20 miles (32\u00a0km) in diameter,[3] with gale-force winds extending 120 miles (190\u00a0km) away from the center of circulation.[6] The flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of 979\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg). After passing between the islands of Grenada and Carriacou in the morning hours of September 23, Janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern Caribbean Sea.[3] As a result, the hurricane became disorganized, with winds weakening to 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) by 1200 UTC on September 23.[4][3] A U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane entered the hurricane early on September 24, reporting a lack of organization, and noting an indiscernible center of circulation with weak rainbands.[3] However, the hurricane began to reintensify in favorable conditions, regaining major hurricane strength by 1200 UTC on September 24 and subsequently Category 4 hurricane intensity by the next day.[6][4] While trekking across the central Caribbean Sea, Janet was only slightly larger than while it was moving over the Windward Islands, with gale-force winds extending 125 miles (201\u00a0km) out from the center by September 25.[6] Remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it moved erratically westward across the Caribbean, a reconnaissance flight mission during the night of September 25\u201326 indicated strong rainbands with frequent lightning strikes and a well-defined eye, evidence that the storm was once again rapidly intensifying.[3] As it neared the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on September 26, Janet began accelerating in forward speed.[6] After the reconnaissance flight Snowcloud Five was lost while making a penetration into the hurricane's eye, another flight early on September 27 reported a minimum pressure of 938\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg), with winds in excess of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) \"by a large and incalculable amount.\"[3] The hurricane was estimated to have intensified to Category 5 hurricane intensity\u2014the highest rating on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale\u2014at 1700 UTC on September 27, shortly before passing over the Swan Islands. Janet continued to intensify afterwards, eventually reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h),[4] with gale-force winds having expanded to at least 250 miles (400\u00a0km) away from the center of the hurricane.[6] Janet maintained peak intensity as it made landfall in extreme southern Quintana Roo, Mexico, just east of Chetumal, Mexico. In that city, an anemometer at the airport reported winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h) before being blown away, and a barometer indicated a minimum barometric pressure of 914\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg) in the eye of Janet.[3] At the time, this was the second-lowest pressure ever recorded on land in a landfalling Atlantic hurricane, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane,[3] though Janet was later surpassed by hurricanes Dean and Gilbert, which also made landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula as Category 5 hurricanes.[8] Once over land, Janet considerably weakened to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h). After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula with a forward speed of 21\u00a0mph (34\u00a0km/h), the hurricane emerged into the Bay of Campeche by 1600 UTC on September 28.[4][6] The weakened hurricane marginally intensified as it crossed the Bay of Campeche to a secondary peak intensity of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) with a minimum central pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[4] Janet eventually made its final landfall 50 miles (80\u00a0km) north of the city of Veracruz by 2200 UTC on September 29 as a Category 2 hurricane. After moving inland, the hurricane became quickly disorganized due to the highly mountainous terrain of Mexico, and as a result the Weather Bureau issued its last advisory on Janet.[6] The weakening system degenerated to tropical storm strength by September 30, and later dissipated over central Mexico by 0600 UTC that day.[4] Janet's remnant circulation contributed to the development of a disturbed area of weather off the western coast of Mexico that would subsequently develop into a tropical storm on October 1.[6]"

After a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested, hurricane warnings were issued at 1600 UTC on September 22 for the entirety of the Lesser Antilles from Saint Lucia to Grenada, including Barbados. Storm warnings were issued for all islands in the Windward Islands from Saint Lucia south to Tobago, excluding St. Vincent and the Grenadines. All warnings in the Windward Antilles remained in effect until 1000 UTC on September 22. Shortly after warnings were lowered in the Windward Islands, storm warnings were issued for the ABC islands and the Paraguan\u00e1 Peninsula of Venezuela at 0200 UTC on September 23. After Janet passed north of the islands, all storm warnings were lifted on the morning of September 25. The Weather Bureau later warned interests in Jamaica, but did not issue any hurricane-related warnings for the island.[6]"

After Janet began accelerating towards the west-northwest, advisories warned areas in British Honduras and Quintana Roo of hurricane-related impacts. Though no official warnings were issued for areas of Central America, advisories published by the Weather Bureau cautioned interests in the hurricane's path up until landfall.[6] Evacuations took place in several coastal towns in Quintana Roo upon notification of the oncoming storm. People were evacuated to inland hillside shelters.[9] After the hurricane moved through the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, the Weather Bureau alerted areas in the storm's path on the western side of Mexico's Gulf Coast. At the time, Janet was expected to make landfall between Veracruz and Tuxpan. Areas were warned of the storm's potential flooding and coastal impacts. The Weather Bureau advised all small craft south of Port O'Connor, Texas to remain in port. Notifications of Janet to potentially affected areas were stopped after the hurricane made landfall.[6]"

Maximum sustained winds on the south side of the island were estimated to be between 110\u2013120\u00a0mph (180\u2013190\u00a0km/h).[3] The strong winds knocked out communication lines, preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island,[14] though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio.[15] Electric power was later restored, allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm.[16] Sugar cane, the island country's main source of revenue, was severely damaged, with losses estimated to be in excess of $1 million.[14] Poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds.[17] An estimated 8,100 homes were damaged by the hurricane.[18] The destroyed buildings and trees blocked highways,[17] and the Seawell Airport was forced to close.[19] Heavy rains peaked at 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) and a storm surge of 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) swept away low-lying houses along the coast.[9] An estimated 2,000 people were left homeless due to the hurricane.[10] Property damage on Barbados was estimated to be $5 million,[10] and at least 57 people were killed.[11] On September 23 Janet passed directly between Grenada and Carriacou in the Grenadines, killing 122 people in the island chain.[3] An airport on Grenada was covered in debris strewn by the strong winds. Eight people were killed in a small town adjacent to the airport. Strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses, and unroofed a hotel in St. George's, Grenada.[20] Houses were also unroofed, and balconies of government offices in St. George's were torn off.[21] All bridges in the island's interior regions collapsed,[22] and spice crops sustained heavy damage.[23] An estimated 75% of nutmeg plantations were destroyed,[24] along with nearly all of the island's banana and cocoa crops.[25] Three ships were also grounded in the local harbor.[23] In The Carenage, the waterfront region of St. George's, debris was scattered and an 820-foot (250\u00a0m) pier collapsed.[24] St. Vincent was mostly destroyed,[26] and St. Lucia suffered significant coastal damage.[27] Over $2.8 million in damages were estimated throughout the Grenadines.[3] Farther south, in Port of Spain, a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed, killing ten people.[13] Hurricane Janet skirted the ABC islands with strong winds as it passed to the north from September 24\u201325.[4] In Aruba, gusts peaked at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), uprooting trees. However, damage outside of trees was primarily insignificant. In Bonaire, piers were destroyed, and the island's coastal boulevard was damaged. Beach facilities at Cura\u00e7ao's Piscadera and Vaersen Bays suffered considerable damage. Quays along the harbor entrance were also damaged.[28]"

Windham, was sent from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to investigate Janet, which was at the time a Category 4 hurricane south of Jamaica.[29] Upon penetration of the hurricane's eyewall at an altitude of 700 feet (210\u00a0m), a final transmission was received from the reconnaissance flight before it presumably crashed in the Caribbean Sea.[30] All 11 people on board, including nine crew members and two journalists, were killed.[30] Following the loss of the plane, an extensive search and rescue operation took place over a large area of the Caribbean Sea, with 3,000 personnel involved with the search, returning no results.[29] The exact cause of the crash remains unknown, though it is speculated that the plane's altimeter gave an incorrect reading due to the low surrounding barometric pressure[30] or that the excess workload placed on one of the crew members due to another crew member having been replaced by one of the reporters caused him to lose track of the plane's height above the water.[29] Although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943, Snowcloud Five remains the only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft as a result of a hurricane in the Atlantic basin, with the other three occurring as a result of Pacific typhoons.[31]"

Storm surge pushed water to a depth of 6.5 feet (2.0\u00a0m), 1,600 feet (490\u00a0m) inland, despite the peninsula protecting the city from the open ocean. The death toll in Chetumal remains uncertain; 120 bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found.[3] An additional 10,000 people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane, and were forced to sleep in the open overnight.[37] Federal relief agencies previously providing service for areas affected by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the Gulf Coast of Mexico were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[38] In Quintana Roo, Hurricane Janet was estimated to have caused $40 million in damages and at least 500 deaths, the most of any region affected by Janet.[3]"

Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30% of all trees had been damaged, especially mahogany and sapodilla trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631 million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was expected to have a 20% decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras' offshore cayes. Similar to Corozal and Orange Walk Districts, corn, trees, and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop.[39] In Corozal Town, British Honduras, south of where Janet made landfall, 500 people were made homeless, and six people were killed.[40] About 90% of all buildings in the town were destroyed,[41] and communications were knocked out by the strong winds.[40] Based on an average home cost of $2,000, it was estimated that property damage to homes in Corozal Town totaled $800,000.[39] Much of Santa Elena, British Honduras was also flattened by the strong winds.[37] Farther south in Belize City, winds peaked at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), though no damage was reported.[42] In British Honduras, the hurricane's effects were less deadly than in Quintana Roo,[43] but in northern portions of the colony the storm killed 16 people and caused $5 million in damages.[3]"

The stranded ship was heavily damaged by the hurricane's strong winds in the bay, which broke towing lines. All of the ship's crewmen, which had evacuated the boat after it sunk, were later rescued and brought back to Tampa, Florida.[44] Along the coast, tides were reported to be 3\u20134 feet (0.91\u20131.22\u00a0m) above average. Farther north along the Texas coast, tides were 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) above average, blocking beach roads near Corpus Christi.[45] Janet made its final landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz between the cities of Nautla and Veracruz as a Category 2 hurricane at 2200 UTC on September 29.[4] In Nautla, communications were cut by strong winds from the hurricane.[46] The strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash, causing five deaths.[47] Heavy rains in the Tampico, Tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year. The resulting flood was reported by the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans to be one of the worst natural disasters in Mexican history.[3] In Tampico, 16 inches (410\u00a0mm) of rain was reported.[48] The floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak,[49][50] causing over 1,000 people to evacuate out of the city to prevent further spreading of the diseases. An additional 36,000 people were being cared for in concentration centers.[50] Although located south of where Janet made landfall, areas of Veracruz were inundated by strong storm surge, including the city's main streets and port.[46] Operations along a railroad stretching from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City were stopped, after having just reopened due to Hurricane Hilda.[51] Farther inland, as Janet dissipated over the mountainous central Mexico, the storm dropped torrential rainfall over the Tames\u00ed and P\u00e1nuco River basins.[52] The water levels in the Panuco River remained above flood stage for four weeks.[53] In Tampico, the river flooded neighborhoods, forcing cables to be stretched along roads to prevent people from being swept away. Small boats were also sent to monitor streets.[54] According to some sources, 800 people died from the floods, with thousands more being stranded in the city.[52] Tamazunchale was inundated by an overflowing Moctezuma River.[55] The rains caused a landslide in Colonia San Rafael, killing 12 people.[47] Heavy rains also impacted Guadalajara, which had previously not been affected by any tropical cyclones earlier in the year. In Maltarana, Jalisco, the Lerma and Duero Rivers overflowed, forcing 800 people in the town to evacuate.[54] Farther north, in Sonora, cotton crops damaged by Janet were estimated to amount to $12 million in damages.[56] Combined property damage in Mexico from Hurricanes Gladys, Hilda, and Janet was estimated to total $200 million, nearly half of the government's 1955 national budget.[57] Although there were no official damage or fatality estimates,[3] at least 1,000 people were injured and another 100,000 people were made homeless on the Mexican mainland due to Janet.[58]"

The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.[60] In Grenada, the island's governor issued an emergency order against the hoarding of food in the aftermath of Janet, due to the food and water shortage that resulted from Janet. A United States destroyer and a British frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to Grenada, and ships departing from Jamaica and Trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies.[61] The British government later announced that it would send \u00a350,000 (US$155,000) in relief to the Grenadines.[nb 3][63] The Crown Agents and Red Cross delivered relief supplies to Barbados and the Grenadines, which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators.[64]"

Temporary communication lines were rebuilt, which initially only allowed official communications with affected areas. Due to the severity of the damage in Corozal, an airstrip was built to help deliver relief to the city more efficiently. Food depots in Corozal, Louisville, and Orange Walk Town were tasked with distributing food. The potential for widespread disease following the devastation wrought by Janet forced a widespread vaccination initiative against typhoid fever in affected areas.[39] The Jamaican government sent \u00a320,000 (US$55,000) to the colony in relief funds,[64] while the British government sent \u00a340,000 (US$110,000) to affected areas in the British Honduras and other affected islands in the Caribbean. The United States sent the cargo ship USS Antares, which supplied the colony with various relief materials.[39] In Corozal Town, a $3.5 million grant was given to land surveyor H.C. Fairweather to plan and reconstruct the township.[66] A U.S. Navy relief plane was sent to Chetumal, Mexico, to deliver food and other relief supplies after Janet struck the region.[67] In areas previously affected by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year, federal relief agencies were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[38] However, after crossing the Bay of Campeche and making landfall near Veracruz, relief measures were once again implemented in the western Gulf Coast of Mexico. The Mexican Air Force, commercial and private planes, and helicopters were sent to bring relief supplies and airlift refugees.[68] The United States initiated the largest relief campaign ever staged in Mexico at the time. Various government and relief agencies, including the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army, participated in the relief efforts.[69] The U.S. Air Force and United States Army began a joint-relief operation to send relief supplies to the Tampico area, beginning with the deployment of a Curtiss C-46 Commando from the Harlingen Air Force Base on October 1.[47] Ten other military transport aircraft from the U.S. Air Force were sent from Texas to provide food and clothing. Pan American World Airways sent a Boeing 314 from Miami, Florida to evacuate victims.[56] Helicopters were sent from the USS Saipan to transfer food and medical supplies from the light aircraft carrier. Other ships also aided in delivering supplies,[70] including the USS Siboney, which also deployed helicopters to assist in relief efforts. By October 6, 1,500 people were estimated to have been rescued from the Tampico area, and at least 280,000\u00a0lb (130,000\u00a0kg) of food and clothing materials were estimated to have been delivered by the US Air Force to the city.[56] There, typhoid serum shots were administered as a precautionary measure.[12] Former president Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho died of a heart ailment, in part due to over-exertion in helping in the relief efforts.[71] Due to the destruction left in its wake, the name Janet was retired by the U.S. Weather Bureau following the 1955 season. It was one of four names retired that year.[72]"

It continued west-northwestward, quickly strengthening to a hurricane the next day with a minimum central pressure of 993\u00a0mb.[1] Early in the afternoon of August 22, Cleo crossed Guadeloupe as a 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a03 hurricane.[2] The hurricane continued to strengthen as it moved through the Caribbean Sea and reached its peak intensity of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) on August 23 while south of the Dominican Republic.[2] It maintained that intensity for 18 hours, bringing heavy rain and winds to Hispaniola. As Cleo passed south of Haiti on August 24, it veered northward momentarily, enough to move on to the Southwest Peninsula of Haiti. The circulation of the hurricane was greatly disrupted by the mountainous terrain of the island, quickly weakening the hurricane.[3] Cleo weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane before hitting southern Cuba on August 26. It crossed the island quickly. Shortly after emerging from the north coast of Cuba, Cleo restrengthened to a hurricane, having weakened to a tropical storm while over Cuba. Cleo quickly intensified to a 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a02 hurricane before hitting the Miami, Florida area on August 27. It weakened to a tropical storm while over Florida later that day.[2] The center moved offshore between Jacksonville and St. Augustine, Florida, before moving back onshore near Savannah, Georgia on August 29 without any increase in intensity. Its northward path along the Florida coast was unusual for the month of August.[4] Cleo continued to weaken as it moved through the Carolinas, drifting through as a tropical depression. After bringing heavy rain through the area, Cleo exited into the Atlantic Ocean near Norfolk, Virginia,[5] and quickly intensified to a tropical storm again on September 1. The following day, Cleo became a hurricane again, but it remained well offshore and did not cause any further damage. Cleo was last noted on September 5 northeast of Newfoundland."

It was the sixteenth tropical cyclone and the fourteenth named storm of the season, as well as the last of eight tropical storms to form in September.[2] Originating from a broad monsoonal low, Nicole became a tropical depression over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 28. It maintained an unusual structure as it tracked northeastward, with a poorly defined wind circulation and few thunderstorms near its center. Nicole approached the coast of Cuba as a weak tropical storm, losing its status as a tropical cyclone over the territory on September 29. The remnants emerged over the Bahamas and eventually became absorbed by a separate extratropical system. Due to Nicole's atypical structure, the strongest convection was well removed from the center; most of the weather activity occurred over the north-central Caribbean. In Jamaica, the storm triggered widespread power outages across more than 288,000 residences. Extreme precipitation of up to 37.42 inches (950\u00a0mm) caused disastrous flooding in several parishes, severely damaging or destroying 528 houses. The devastation extended to the island's farmland and environment, which suffered from expansive water pollution. In all, Nicole wrought an estimated $245.4 million (2010 USD) in damage throughout Jamaica, and there were sixteen fatalities. Elsewhere, minor flooding occurred in Cuba, Florida, and the Cayman Islands. The remnants of the storm contributed to a large disturbance along the East Coast of the United States, causing additional damage and deaths."

        "content": "In late September 2010, a wide band of disturbed weather and low pressure, associated with the monsoon trough and remnant tropical moisture from Tropical Storm Matthew, meandered over the northwestern Caribbean Sea.[3] With a broad upper ridge anchored along the Yucat\u00e1n coast, diffluence aloft in the vicinity of the disturbance provided focus for the development of scattered convection.[4] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted an environment supportive of tropical development, and by September 27, a broad surface low formed amid the convection.[5] The next day, surface pressures steadily dropped as sustained winds around the low proximated tropical storm force.[6] Throughout the development process, moderate westerly wind shear over the region caused the disturbance to exhibit a rather asymmetric structure;[1] it developed an elongated low-pressure center by September 28, well to the northwest of its strongest wind field.[7] Despite the asymmetry, the NHC initiated advisories on a tropical depression around 15:00 UTC that day, after surface and satellite observations revealed a sufficiently defined circulation center west of the deep convection.[8] Post-season reassessments, however, indicated that a tropical storm had, in fact, formed three hours earlier, about 75 miles (120\u00a0km) south of Cuba's Isle of Youth, which operationally was not named Nicole until a day later.[1][9] For most of its duration, Nicole maintained a generally northeastward motion, caught in the steering flow between a large mid- to upper-level trough and an anticyclone to the west.[1][8] Within hours of the storm's formation, observations from a hurricane hunters flight confirmed a composition similar to the one initially discerned, with the strongest gusts and thunderstorms dislocated 250\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km) east from the ill-defined center.[1][10] In comparison, the core consisted of light winds and sporadic convection\u2014a structure rather characteristic of a North Indian Ocean monsoon depression.[10][11] The system's ambiguous nature led to disagreement among weather specialists over its classification: while the NHC maintained its tropical cyclone status, Cuban meteorologist Jos\u00e9 Rubiera stated that \"no tropical storm exists over [Cuba], or near it,\" noting a lack of significant winds in the country's vicinity.[12] Over the course of September 29, radar data showed the convection increasing over the northern half of the storm;[13] bands of intense thunderstorms in the southeastern periphery also formed closer to the center, and weather buoys and ships in that region observed sustained tropical-storm-force winds.[9] Around 12:00 UTC, Nicole attained an estimated peak intensity of 45 miles per hour (72\u00a0km/h) winds and a minimum pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg), just south of Cuba.[1] Despite the increase in strength,[9] Nicole's circulation soon became exceedingly elongated and untrackable over central Cuba, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone by 15:00 UTC.[1][14] The remnant low began interacting with the neighboring trough that had steered Nicole in its tropical stages, resulting in significant precipitation along the southeastern coastlines of the United States. Accelerating toward the northeast, the system acquired frontal characteristics and became extratropical over the Bahamas by 0600 UTC, September 30, twelve hours before merging with a developing system over eastern North Carolina.[1] Lingering low pressure and broad cyclonic flow over the north-central Caribbean in Nicole's wake contributed to the development of Hurricane Paula in the first weeks of October.[15]"

Though airport officials later reported normal conditions,[30] an additional 26 flights were canceled at Miami International Airport the next day.[31] The National Hockey League postponed a preseason game by the Florida Panthers.[32] In Brunswick and New Hanover counties, North Carolina, officials readied shelters on September 29 to accommodate stranded residents unable to access their homes. Multiple schools in New Hanover and Pender County remained closed the next morning due to worsening storm conditions from the disturbance succeeding Nicole.[33] At the threat of prolonged rainfall, a flood watch was issued for Kent County, Maryland, from September 30 to October 1. Also in the area, the National Weather Service declared both a coastal flood advisory and wind advisory for September 30.[34]"

        "content": "Nicole and its precursor disturbance brought great rainfall to much of Jamaica over a period of several days. A maximum total of 37.42 inches (950\u00a0mm) was recorded in Belleisle, Westmoreland Parish, from September 26 to 30;[1] most other parishes received at least 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) during the same period. With a return period of 30 years, these quantities tripled the monthly rainfall average for September at several locations. Though the broad-scale wind regime over the island remained gentle, the storm's intense convective bands produced three microbursts\u2014small downdrafts of intense winds.[35] With dozens of river banks and waterways blocked, the worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities, primarily in the southern parishes.[35][36] The disaster affected 507,831 people on the island; it resulted in 16 deaths\u201414 confirmed\u2014and 42 injuries.[35] In Saint Andrew Parish's Sandy Park, a house next to a street gully succumbed to the effects of the storm; five bodies were recovered near the site, while the final missing inhabitant was presumed dead.[37][38] Elsewhere in Saint Andrew, three construction workers were killed when the shed in which they were sleeping collapsed.[39] A girl was crushed to death under the weight of a collapsed board house in Saint Catherine Parish.[40] Rushing waters swept away three people in different parts of the island.[41][42] Amid a microburst, a waterspout tore roofs off buildings and hospitalized five residents in Westmoreland Parish's capital of Savanna-la-Mar,[35][43] while to the northwest, strong gusts and rough surf impacted the resort town of Negril.[44] In the wake of the storm, a body was recovered from debris along a road in Saint Catherine.[45] Flooded streets, roads, and bridges isolated communities across seven of the island's parishes and trapped hundreds of residents in their homes.[46][47] Jamaica's infrastructure was devastated in the deluge, accounting for most of Nicole's damage to the island. More than 288,000 residences were without power at the height of the storm due to downed electricity lines and poles. About 40 percent of the island's water supply had been disrupted at some point.[35] Dozens of bridges experienced total collapse under the force of swollen rivers and creeks. In Kingston, many underpasses became totally inundated as the prolonged rain overwhelmed storm drains; the flooding that followed left many of the city's roads impassable.[48] Destruction to the infrastructure was especially extensive in Westmoreland, Saint Elizabeth, and Hanover parishes, though overall, 543 of the island's principle roads sustained at least some degree of damage.[35] The total costs linked to the infrastructure neared J$20 billion (US$235.4 million).[49] Nicole also wreaked widespread property damage: of the 2,169 homes affected, 474 sustained severe damage while 54 were beyond repair. The losses totaled J$274.3 million (US$3.2 million), J$75.6 million (US$890,000) hereof to replace destroyed housing units.[35] With much of the island's crops and livestock washed away, including 40 percent of the season's banana produce, the agricultural sector suffered J$576.5 million (US$6.8 million) in losses. The storm had a discernible impact on the environment, which plays a crucial role in Jamaica's economy and tourism sectors. Surface runoff and spills along industrial zones and sewage systems infiltrated large stretches of land, leading to soil contamination, coastal erosion, and deteriorated ecosystems. In addition, there were traces of light damage to vegetation, such as uprooted trees.[35]"

The region also briefly observed gale-force winds, with gusts to 53 miles per hour (85\u00a0km/h) at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.[1] Throughout eastern Cuba, nearly 300 people sought refuge from the storm. As the rivers in Granma overflowed, eight houses collapsed and more than 300 others were inundated in the coastal town of Pil\u00f3n. The flooding obstructed several roads, with sections of the highway between Granma and Santiago de Cuba destroyed. The storm resulted in 5,000\u00a0lbs (2.5 tons) of lost crops and livestock.[51] These effects were nevertheless considered to be minor when viewed against the rainfall's alleviation of a persistent dry spell.[52] In the Cayman Islands, gusts to 51 miles per hour (82\u00a0km/h) stirred up rough seas with 8\u201310-foot (2.4\u20133.0\u00a0m) waves, which caused some light erosion along southern and western shores.[53][54] Rainfall over the region was heavy and widespread, although the greatest quantities fell over Grand Cayman; the Owen Roberts International Airport recorded 9.02 inches (229\u00a0mm) over a two-day period.[53] Overall damage to the islands was limited: The blustery rains flooded low-lying areas, caused roof leaks, and knocked out the power in eastern Grand Cayman.[53] Despite the initial threat of strong thunderstorms and gusts, Florida was spared a direct hit from Nicole. The storm skirted the state with only showers:[55] 12.71 inches (323\u00a0mm) of rain fell at North Key Largo, though the mainland received much smaller quantities.[56] The storm flooded streets in Miami Beach and the northern Florida Keys, as well as one home.[1] Similarly, inclement weather spread over the northwestern Bahamas without significant consequences.[1][57]"

Widespread flooding, exacerbated by overflowing creeks and rivers, engulfed blocks of homes.[60] About 150 roads were closed off due to the hazardous conditions; seven people were nonetheless killed in traffic accidents across the state.[61] In the Mid-Atlantic, the weather event broke the 24-hour rainfall record for September 30 at several locations: the Norfolk, Baltimore\u2013Washington, and Ronald Reagan Washington airports recorded 7.85 inches (199\u00a0mm), 6.02 inches (153\u00a0mm), and 4.66 inches (118\u00a0mm), respectively.[57] In Maryland, two buses collided amid the stormy weather, injuring 26 of their passengers.[58] In the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, all access to the Delaware River in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area was blocked off.[62] With localized estimates of up to 8 inches (200\u00a0mm),[63] the state of New York experienced some of its most historic rainfall; an official total 4.24 inches (108\u00a0mm) shattered the 24-hour record for any calendar day in Binghamtom.[59] Flash floods throughout the state resulted in one drowning death and US$10,000 in damage.[63] Considerable flooding also occurred in Vermont and Pennsylvania, with a 24-hour rainfall maximum of 10.5 inches (270\u00a0mm) in Moscow.[61] Farther north, the remnant low enhanced a pressure gradient over southern New England, generating strong winds that knocked out the power in Litchfield County. Rainfall there additionally caused minor flooding.[64] In Quebec, torrents following 3.5 inches (89\u00a0mm) of rainfall inundated basements and caused two drownings.[58] Despite the deaths and damage, the rains lightened prolonged drought conditions in those regions.[65]"

In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles.[66] About J$4 million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12 million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2 million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50 million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.[67] Eleven days after the storm, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies allocated CHF150,644 (US$156,221) to sustain the Jamaica Red Cross in distributing aid to about 500 families\u2014or 2,500 beneficiaries\u2014in need of life supplies.[47] In late December 2010, the Jamaica\u2013Canadian Association in Toronto, Ontario, raised a total of CDN$10,153.87 (US$10,221.33) in relief funds for flood victims.[68] The Hanover Parish Council requested J$30 million (US$351,000) to assist the Saint James Parish Council and other municipal authorities across the country in post-storm clean-up and beautification work.[69] A grant of J$279 million (US$3.26 million) was approved for the reconstruction of a major roadway section in Westmoreland Parish.[70] In spite of the timely relief efforts, Nicole's effects were still felt for months in its wake. The gross domestic product for Jamaica, which had been suffering from a substantially slow economic growth rate, further declined following the extensive damage.[71] The agriculture sector sustained slight losses from reduced egg production due to the storm's traumatizing effects on farm chickens.[72] In the face of the high repair costs, the island saw below-standard levels of holiday season consumption for 2010.[73]"

As the eighteenth storm and twelfth typhoon of the season, Trix formed on October 15 as a tropical depression over Micronesia, being first tracked by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Trix slowly strengthened as it moved westwards, before it rapidly intensified as it neared the Philippines. Slight weakening took place before the system passed over the country before restrengthening in the South China Sea. There, Trix degraded again for the second time and moved over Vietnam as a tropical storm before dissipating over Thailand. The severe effects of Trix were on Visayas and southern Luzon, where croplands, houses and communication and transportation services were disrupted and destroyed as a result. The Philippine Weather Bureau warned people about rain-induced landslides, gusty winds and seas from the storm. UPI and AP called the system the worst in years due to its catastrophic aftermath. Many bodies were recovered and death toll were continuously increasing as several areas were slowly recovering from the disaster. The total casualty figure from the storm were at 995 while damages stood at $60 million, in which the majority are from Bicol region.

Intensification of Trix continued as it slowly approached the Philippines, strengthening to winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) on October 19. The storm then reached its lowest pressure according to JMA, with 965 hectopascals (28.5\u00a0inHg) on October 19 at 0600 UTC.

These deaths were first reported in Sorsogon, Albay, Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur. Thousands of bamboo and wood houses and huts were also leveled by Trix; however, the capital Manila was spared from its full brunt as the system crossed the country. Damages to public and private establishments, fish corrals and several crops were reported to be \"heavy\" in Leyte, Samar and southeastern Luzon. At that time, transportation and communication activities were disrupted and local flights in the country were also canceled as a result; however it was expected to resume at that day. The country's Weather Bureau warned Filipinos in the path of the storm to continue to take action against floods, winds and rough seas in Mindoro, northwest Visayas and south Luzon.[7][8] On October 23, the Philippine Red Cross reported that the death toll from Trix further rose to 370 and the missing persons at 200. These casualty figures were released by the organization at 8:30 PM PHT (6:30 AM EST). The governor of Albay at that time, Manuel Calleja, informed the PRC via telegraph that over 118 residents of Tabaco City alone perished during the storm and they were subsequently buried in mass graves on October 23. The United Press International called Trix \"the most violent storm to hit the Philippines in five years\". They also estimated a casualty toll of 155 and damages of $2.5 million; however, according to them, it was \"conservative\". Broken communication lines disrupted the recovery process in the country and the transmission of information regarding the aftermath of the storm in various areas across Trix' path. Soggy airfields also hampered the delivery of relief goods and supplies to affected areas.[9][10][11] The president at that time, Elpidio Quirino ordered the country's health secretary Juan Salcedo to go to Bicol region to lead the relief efforts there. He also mobilized the nation's relief efforts in the severely hit areas for fast and speed recoveries. Legazpi reports indicated that thousands there were homeless, Naga City's private institutions and houses were damaged due to the storm, Leyte lost half of its rice crops, 80% of banana crops and 50% of fruit trees. Philippine Air Force planes brought medicine and food shipments for Legazpi; the PRC sent its people to other affected areas with clothing, medicine, tents, canned good and rice. However, these efforts were continued to be hampered by communication and transport difficulties. Damage estimates were said to be at \"several million dollars\". 30% of houses in its path were also damaged.[9][10][11] By October 24, 431 were reported to have been killed by Trix and the missing stood at 369. Damages were officially estimated at $60 million. Rodolfo Nazarena, a United Press staff correspondent flew to Legazpi to survey and see the damages there and reported that 90% of city were wrecked. Only three buildings survived in the area. The death toll slowly rose as communications slowly came back from some of the affected areas.[12] \"The worst typhoon within living memory.\" Feliciano Cruz, a Philippine Red Cross official.[12] On October 25, the death toll further rose to 444 and the missing at 460. A Red Cross spokesperson from the country reported that death toll might rise higher to 600 as late reports continue to appear despite a new typhoon approaching from its east, Wilma. Meanwhile, the Associated Press called Trix the \"worst tropical storm in 50 years\" as it devastated a wide swath of southern Luzon especially Legazpi and Tabaco. Preliminary estimates by the governor of Albay were set at $40 million from school, building and crop damages. Over 500,000 persons were rendered homeless. Ramon Magsaysay, the defense secretary at that time, flew to the affected areas in the south to assess the damages, along with cases of canned goods and ricebags as the military's initial contribution to the victims of the disaster. Food, clothing and medical supplies were also transported aboard Philippine Navy ships for Albay, Sorsogon and Northern Samar, the areas reported without food or water as of that date. private groups and institutions in Manila began raising funds to help the individuals who suffered greatly during Trix.[13] On the next day, 444 individuals were reported dead from Trix and 469 were still missing, bringing up the death toll to 913. Unnoficial reports also indicated that over 350 fishermen were lost from Bicol region due to the storm. In addition, the Natunawan Island, a barrier island near San Carlos, Negros Occidental submerged due to the cyclone. The official casualty record from the system were finalized at 995, with 509 dead and 486 missing.[14][15][16] In Indochina, reports there indicated that the storm killed at least 405 in the region. A tornado near present-day Ho Chi Minh City killed 10 people and injured one when a French Air Force aircraft crashed in a mountain near the area.[5][17]"

Belna reached tropical cyclone strength on 7\u00a0December as it began to turn towards the southwest, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) before fluctuating in intensity over the following day as it passed just east of Mayotte. On 9\u00a0December, Belna restrengthened and reattained its peak winds upon making landfall near Soalala along the northwestern coast of Madagascar. The cyclone weakened before ultimately dissipating over southern Madagascar on 11\u00a0December. In the French overseas department of Mayotte, up to 15,000\u00a0people relocated to shelters in advance of the storm. Several of the department's services, including the main airport and ferries, were suspended. The cyclone ultimately passed 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) east of Mayotte with only minor impacts. Northern Madagascar was impacted by heavy rains from Belna. Soalala and Antsiranana experienced extensive flooding. Strong winds in Soalala damaged the roofs of 80% of homes and government offices. In total, there were nine fatalities and over 2,000\u00a0injuries associated with Belna. Damage in Madagascar is estimated at US$25 million.[2]"

        "content": "MFR began highlighting the potential for tropical cyclone development in their daily bulletins on 25\u00a0November, noting an increase in shower activity west of Seychelles.[3] Aided by the passage of a Kelvin wave and a favourable window in the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, a broad trough of low pressure began to take shape within the storm activity, extending across the equator.[4][5] Projections from computer models remained in disagreement over the system's future, complicated by the concurrent development of a tropical disturbance in the northwestern Indian Ocean along the same trough.[5] A loosely-defined wind circulation was detected 263\u00a0km (163\u00a0mi) south of Mahe, Seychelles on 29\u00a0November, offset from convection.[6] Over the following days, this circulation tightened within an environment moderately conducive for tropical development.[7][8] M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France declared the system as a zone of disturbed weather on 2\u00a0December; at the time the system had drifted west from its point of origin.[9] Although the storm was better organised and the environment conducive for intensification, the storm's wind field initially remained elongated and rainfall remained north of the storm's centre.[10][11][12] The disturbance became a tropical depression on 5\u00a0December, attended by an increase in rainbands and the return of convection at the centre of circulation;[13][14] at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, the system was upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Belna.[9] Belna was upgraded to severe tropical storm status early on 6\u00a0December.[9] Around the same time, a cloud-obscured eye briefly became apparent in microwave satellite imagery. Due to a strengthening area of high pressure to its east, Belna began to curve from its initial westward drift to a more directed southwestward trajectory.[15] After a brief period of strengthening,[9] Belna's central dense overcast remained largely unchanged throughout 6\u00a0December before signs of resumed intensification emerged by the day's end, followed by the development of another eye 9\u201319\u00a0km (5.6\u201311.8\u00a0mi) across.[16][17][18] With the storm's eye becoming better defined, MFR upgraded Belna to a tropical cyclone early on 7\u00a0December. Hot towers were detected atop and within the storm's radius of maximum winds, suggesting the onset of a more accelerated rate of intensification.[19] However, the presence of dry air in the mid-levels of the troposphere towards the storm's southeastern quadrant prevented Belna from developing considerably.[20] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on 7\u00a0December, Belna's winds topped out at 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) before fluctuating at a slightly lower strength over the ensuing day.[9] The system's structure disorganised significantly in a short period, caused by both the dry air and northerly wind shear.[21] The cyclone's structure varied considerably throughout 8\u00a0December, at times featuring a small eye surrounded by intense lightning activity and at other times degrading in response to an intrusion of dry air into the Belna's circulation.[22][23] Belna's strength was highly variable in part due to its small size, making it susceptible to changes in the local atmospheric environment and complicating forecasts.[24] On 9\u00a0December, a new phase of intensification began as Belna approached the Madagascar coast near Soalala, with an eye becoming apparent on visible satellite imagery.[25] In its advisories, the MFR noted a \"spectacular intensification spell\" in the hours leading up to Belna's landfall on Madagascar, assessing the cyclone's winds at 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and the pressure at 965\u00a0mbar (965\u00a0hPa; 28.5\u00a0inHg)\u2013the lowest analysed over the course of the storm's existence\u2014as Belna moved ashore at 15:30\u00a0UTC on 9\u00a0December. The storm then began to weaken as it tracked farther inland, parallelling the western coast of Madagascar.[26] By 12:00\u00a0UTC the next day, Belna's winds had tapered below tropical depression thresholds,[9] though the storm retained a well-defined wind circulation with tightly packed rainbands.[27] Belna curved towards the southeast over Madagascar, and deep convection associated with the cyclone dissipated on 11\u00a0December.[28][29] MFR issued their last update on the system later that day while the centre was over Haute Matsiatra,[9] while the remnant circulation centre associated with Belna was last noted in MFR's bulletins on 14\u00a0December.[30]"

Late on March 17, Herold reached its peak intensity as an Intense tropical cyclone, and the JTWC classified it as a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone. As this happened, Herold rapidly moved southeast,[5] Herold's peak intensity was short-lived. On 18 March, Herold began rapidly weakening. Later that day, Herold became extratropical.

Its western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Angola and Zambia to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the east and south. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, less than 200 metres (660 feet) of the Botswanan right bank of the Zambezi River separates the two countries. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek. The driest country in sub-Saharan Africa,[17] Namibia has been inhabited since pre-historic times by the Khoi, San, Damara and Nama people. Around the 14th century, immigrating Bantu peoples arrived as part of the Bantu expansion. Since then, the Bantu groups, the largest being the Ovambo, have dominated the population of the country; since the late 19th century, they have constituted a majority. With a population of 3,022,401 people today, Namibia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. In 1884, the German Empire established rule over most of the territory, forming a colony known as German South West Africa. Between 1904 and 1908, German troops waged a punitive campaign against the Herero and Nama which escalated into the first genocide of the 20th century. German rule ended during the First World War with a 1915 defeat by South African forces. In 1920, after the end of the war, the League of Nations mandated administration of the colony to South Africa. From 1948, with the National Party elected to power, this included South Africa applying apartheid to what was then known as South West Africa. In the later 20th century, uprisings and demands for political representation resulted in the United Nations assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966, but South Africa maintained de facto rule until 1973, when the UN recognized the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) as the official representative of the Namibian people. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the South African Border War. However, Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands remained under South African control until 1994. Namibia is a stable parliamentary democracy. Agriculture, tourism and the mining industry\u00a0\u201a\u00c4\u00ec including mining for gem diamonds, uranium, gold, silver and base metals\u00a0\u201a\u00c4\u00ec form the basis of its economy, while the manufacturing sector is comparatively small. Despite significant GDP growth since its independence,[18] poverty and inequality remain significant in the country. 40.9% of the population is affected by multidimensional poverty,[19] and more than 400,000 people continue to live in informal housing.[20] Income disparity in the country is one of the world's highest with a Gini coefficient of 59.1 in 2015.[21] Namibia is a member state of the United Nations, the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the Commonwealth of Nations."

For thousands of years, the Khoisan peoples of Southern Africa maintained a nomadic life, the Khoikhoi as pastoralists and the San people as hunter-gatherers. Around the 14th century, immigrating Bantu people began to arrive during the Bantu expansion from central Africa.[24] From the late 18th century onward, Oorlam people from Cape Colony crossed the Orange River and moved into the area that today is southern Namibia.[25] Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful. They received the missionaries accompanying the Oorlam very well,[26] granting them the right to use waterholes and grazing against an annual payment.[27] On their way further north, however, the Oorlam encountered clans of the OvaHerero at Windhoek, Gobabis, and Okahandja, who resisted their encroachment. The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the German Empire deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.[28] In 1878, the Cape of Good Hope, then a British colony, annexed the port of Walvis Bay and the offshore Penguin Islands; these became an integral part of the new Union of South Africa at its creation in 1910. The first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators Diogo C\u221a\u00a3o in 1485[29] and Bartolomeu Dias in 1486, but the Portuguese did not try to claim the area. Like most of the interior of Sub-Saharan Africa, Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century. At that time traders and settlers came principally from Germany and Sweden. In 1870, Finnish missionaries came to the northern part of Namibia to spread the Lutheran religion among the Ovambo and Kavango people.[30] In the late 19th century, Dorsland Trekkers crossed the area on their way from the Transvaal to Angola. Some of them settled in Namibia instead of continuing their journey."

        "content": "Namibia became a German colony in 1884 under Otto von Bismarck to forestall perceived British encroachment and was known as German South West Africa (Deutsch-S\u221a\u00badwestafrika).[31] The Palgrave Commission by the British governor in Cape Town determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of Walvis Bay was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of British South Africa. In 1897, a rinderpest epidemic caused massive cattle die-offs of an estimated 95% of cattle in southern and central Namibia. In response the German colonizers set up a veterinary cordon fence known as the Red Line.[32] In 1907 this fence then broadly defined the boundaries for the first Police Zone.[33] From 1904 to 1907, the Herero and the Namaqua took up arms against ruthless German settlers. In a calculated punitive action by the German settlers, government officials ordered the extinction of the natives in the OvaHerero and Namaqua genocide. In what has been called the \"first genocide of the 20th century\",[34] the Germans systematically killed 10,000 Nama (half the population) and approximately 65,000 Herero (about 80% of the population).[35][36] The survivors, when finally released from detention, were subjected to a policy of dispossession, deportation, forced labour, racial segregation, and discrimination in a system that in many ways foreshadowed the apartheid established by South Africa in 1948. Most Africans were confined to so-called native territories, which under South African rule after 1949 were turned into \"homelands\" (Bantustans). Some historians have speculated that the downfall of the Herero in Namibia was a model for the Nazis in the Holocaust.[37] The memory of what happened under German rule has contributed to shape the ethnic identity in independent Namibia and has kept its significance in today's relations with Germany.[38] The German minister for development aid apologised for the Namibian genocide in 2004. However, the German government distanced itself from this apology.[39] Only in 2021 did the German government acknowledge the genocide and agreed to pay \u201a\u00c7\u00a81.1 billion over 30 years in community aid.[40]"

        "content": "During World War I, South African troops under General Louis Botha occupied the territory and deposed the German colonial administration. The end of the war and the Treaty of Versailles resulted in South West Africa remaining a possession of South Africa, at first as a League of Nations mandate, until 1990.[41] The mandate system was formed as a compromise between those who advocated for an Allied annexation of former German and Ottoman territories and a proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves.[41] It permitted the South African government to administer South West Africa until that territory's inhabitants were prepared for political self-determination.[42] South Africa interpreted the mandate as a veiled annexation and made no attempt to prepare South West Africa for future autonomy.[42] As a result of the Conference on International Organization in 1945, the League of Nations was formally superseded by the United Nations (UN) and former League mandates by a trusteeship system. Article 77 of the United Nations Charter stated that UN trusteeship \"shall apply...to territories now held under mandate\"; furthermore, it would \"be a matter of subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing territories will be brought under the trusteeship system and under what terms\".[43] The UN requested all former League of Nations mandates be surrendered to its Trusteeship Council in anticipation of their independence.[43] South Africa declined to do so and instead requested permission from the UN to formally annex South West Africa, for which it received considerable criticism.[43] When the UN General Assembly rejected this proposal, South Africa dismissed its opinion and began solidifying control of the territory.[43] The UN General Assembly and Security Council responded by referring the issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which held a number of discussions on the legality of South African rule between 1949 and 1966.[44] South Africa began imposing apartheid, its codified system of racial segregation and discrimination, on South West Africa during the late 1940s.[45] Black South West Africans were subject to pass laws, curfews, and a host of residential regulations that restricted their movement.[45] Development was concentrated in the southern region of the territory adjacent to South Africa, known as the \"Police Zone\", where most of the major settlements and commercial economic activity were located.[46] Outside the Police Zone, indigenous peoples were restricted to theoretically self-governing tribal homelands.[46] During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the accelerated decolonisation of Africa and mounting pressure on the remaining colonial powers to grant their colonies self-determination resulted in the formation of nascent nationalist parties in South West Africa.[47] Movements such as the South West African National Union (SWANU) and the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) advocated for the formal termination of South Africa's mandate and independence for the territory.[47] In 1966, following the ICJ's controversial ruling that it had no legal standing to consider the question of South African rule, SWAPO launched an armed insurgency that escalated into part of a wider regional conflict known as the South African Border War.[48] In 1971 Namibian contract workers led a general strike against the contract system and in support of independence.[49] Some of the striking workers would later join SWAPO's PLAN[50] as part of the South African Border War."

SWAPO won a plurality of seats in the Constituent Assembly with 57% of the popular vote.[65] This gave the party 41 seats, but not a two-thirds majority, which would have enabled it to draft the constitution on its own.[65] The Namibian Constitution was adopted in February 1990. It incorporated protection for human rights and compensation for state expropriations of private property and established an independent judiciary, legislature, and an executive presidency (the constituent assembly became the national assembly). The country officially became independent on 21 March 1990.[66][30] Sam Nujoma was sworn in as the first President of Namibia at a ceremony attended by Nelson Mandela of South Africa (who had been released from prison the previous month) and representatives from 147 countries, including 20 heads of state.[67] In 1994, shortly before the first multiracial elections in South Africa, that country ceded Walvis Bay to Namibia.[68]"

Multiparty democracy was introduced and has been maintained, with local, regional and national elections held regularly. Several registered political parties are active and represented in the National Assembly, although the SWAPO has won every election since independence.[69] The transition from the 15-year rule of President Nujoma to his successor Hifikepunye Pohamba in 2005 went smoothly.[70] Since independence, the Namibian government has promoted a policy of national reconciliation. It issued an amnesty for those who fought on either side during the liberation war. The civil war in Angola spilled over and adversely affected Namibians living in the north of the country. In 1998, Namibia Defence Force (NDF) troops were sent to the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of a Southern African Development Community (SADC) contingent. In 1999, the national government quashed a secessionist attempt in the northeastern Caprivi Strip.[70] The Caprivi conflict was initiated by the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA), a rebel group led by Mishake Muyongo. It wanted the Caprivi Strip to secede and form its own society. In December 2014, Prime Minister Hage Geingob, the candidate of ruling SWAPO, won the presidential elections, taking 87% of the vote. His predecessor, President Hifikepunye Pohamba, also of SWAPO, had served the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution.[71] In December 2019, President Hage Geingob was re-elected for a second term, taking 56.3% of the vote.[72] On 4 February 2024, President Hage Geingob died and he was immediately succeeded by vice-president Nangolo Mbumba as new President of Namibia.[73]"

        "content": "At 825,615\u00a0km2 (318,772\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[74] Namibia is the world's thirty-fourth largest country (after Venezuela). It lies mostly between latitudes 17\u00ac\u221e and 29\u00ac\u221eS (a small area is north of 17\u00ac\u221e), and longitudes 11\u00ac\u221e and 26\u00ac\u221eE. Being situated between the Namib and the Kalahari deserts, Namibia has the least rainfall of any country in sub-Saharan Africa.[75] The Namibian landscape consists generally of five geographical areas, each with characteristic abiotic conditions and vegetation, with some variation within and overlap between them: the Central Plateau, the Namib, the Great Escarpment, the Bushveld, and the Kalahari Desert. The Central Plateau runs from north to south, bordered by the Skeleton Coast to the northwest, the Namib Desert and its coastal plains to the southwest, the Orange River to the south, and the Kalahari Desert to the east. The Central Plateau is home to the highest point in Namibia at K\u221a\u2202nigstein elevation 2,606 metres (8,550\u00a0ft).[76] The Namib is a broad expanse of hyper-arid gravel plains and dunes that stretches along Namibia's entire coastline. It varies between 100 and 200 kilometres (60 and 120\u00a0mi) in width. Areas within the Namib include the Skeleton Coast and the Kaokoveld in the north and the extensive Namib Sand Sea along the central coast.[22] The Great Escarpment swiftly rises to over 2,000 metres (7,000\u00a0ft). Average temperatures and temperature ranges increase further inland from the cold Atlantic waters, while the lingering coastal fogs slowly diminish. Although the area is rocky with poorly developed soils, it is significantly more productive than the Namib Desert. As summer winds are forced over the Escarpment, moisture is extracted as precipitation.[77] The Bushveld is found in north-eastern Namibia along the Angolan border and in the Caprivi Strip. The area receives a significantly greater amount of precipitation than the rest of the country, averaging around 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) per year. The area is generally flat and the soils sandy, limiting their ability to retain water and support agriculture.[78] The Kalahari Desert, an arid region that extends into South Africa and Botswana, is one of Namibia's well-known geographical features. The Kalahari, while popularly known as a desert, has a variety of localised environments, including some verdant and technically non-desert areas. The Succulent Karoo is home to over 5,000 species of plants, nearly half of them endemic; approximately 10 percent of the world's succulents are found in the Karoo.[79][80] The reason behind this high productivity and endemism may be the relatively stable nature of precipitation.[81] Namibia's Coastal Desert is one of the oldest deserts in the world. Its sand dunes, created by the strong onshore winds, are the highest in the world.[82] Because of the location of the shoreline, at the point where the Atlantic's cold water reaches Africa's hot climate, often extremely dense fog forms along the coast.[83] Near the coast there are areas where the dune-hummocks are vegetated.[84] Namibia has rich coastal and marine resources that remain largely unexplored.[85] The Caprivi Strip extends east from the northeastern corner of the country."

Its overall climate description is arid, descending from the Sub-Humid [mean rain above 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in)] through Semi-Arid [between 300 and 500\u00a0mm (12 and 20\u00a0in)] (embracing most of the waterless Kalahari) and Arid [from 150 to 300\u00a0mm (6 to 12\u00a0in)] (these three regions are inland from the western escarpment) to the Hyper-Arid coastal plain [less than 100\u00a0mm (4\u00a0in)]. Temperature maxima are limited by the overall elevation of the entire region: only in the far south, Warmbad for instance, are maxima above 40\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC (104\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF) recorded.[89] Typically the sub-Tropical High Pressure Belt, with frequent clear skies, provides more than 300 days of sunshine per year. It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the Tropic of Capricorn cuts the country about in half. The winter (June\u00a0\u201a\u00c4\u00ec August) is generally dry. Both rainy seasons occur in summer: the small rainy season between September and November, and the big one between February and April.[90] Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) in the Caprivi Strip. Rainfall is highly variable, and droughts are common.[91] In the summer of 2006/07 the rainfall was recorded far below the annual average.[92] In May 2019, Namibia declared a state of emergency in response to the drought,[93] and extended it by an additional 6 months in October 2019.[94] Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing Benguela Current of the Atlantic Ocean, which accounts for very low precipitation (50\u00a0mm (2\u00a0in) per year or less), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country.[91] In Winter, occasionally a condition known as Bergwind (German for \"mountain wind\") or Oosweer (Afrikaans for \"east weather\") occurs, a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast. As the area behind the coast is a desert, these winds can develop into sand storms, leaving sand deposits in the Atlantic Ocean that are visible on satellite images.[95] The Central Plateau and Kalahari areas have wide diurnal temperature ranges of up to 30C (54F).[91] Efundja, the annual seasonal flooding of the northern parts of the country, often causes not only damage to infrastructure but loss of life.[96] The rains that cause these floods originate in Angola, flow into Namibia's Cuvelai-Etosha Basin, and fill the oshanas (Oshiwambo: flood plains) there. The worst floods so far[update] occurred in March 2011 and displaced 21,000 people.[97]"

The only perennial rivers are found on the national borders with South Africa, Angola, Zambia, and the short border with Botswana in the Caprivi Strip. In the interior of the country, surface water is available only in the summer months when rivers are in flood after exceptional rainfalls. Otherwise, surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their run-off. Where people do not live near perennial rivers or make use of the storage dams, they are dependent on groundwater. Even isolated communities and those economic activities located far from good surface water sources, such as mining, agriculture, and tourism, can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80% of the country.[98] More than 100,000 boreholes have been drilled in Namibia over the past century. One third of these boreholes have been drilled dry.[99] An aquifer called Ohangwena II, on both sides of the Angola-Namibia border, was discovered in 2012. It has been estimated to be capable of supplying a population of 800,000 people in the North for 400 years, at the current (2018) rate of consumption.[100] Experts estimate that Namibia has 7,720\u00a0km3 (1,850\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of underground water.[101][102] According to African Folder, a sewage-to-water treatment project in Namibia not only provides citizens with safe drinking water, but also boosts productivity by 6% per year. All pollutants and impurities are removed using cutting-edge \"multi-barrier\" technology, which includes residual chlorination, ozone treatment, and ultra membrane filtration. Strict bio-monitoring methods are also used throughout the process to ensure high-quality, safe drinking water.[103] On 8 June 2023, Namibia became the first Southern African country and the eighth country in Africa to accede to the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (UN Water Convention).[104]"

Urban areas are generally neutral or supportive with a few LGBT-dedicated clubs and events.[129] Some Namibian government officials and high-profile figures, such as Namibia's Ombudsman John Walters and First Lady Monica Geingos, had called for sodomy and homosexuality to be decriminalised and are in favour of LGBT rights.[127][130] In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriages legally made outside of Namibia must be recognized by the government.[131] In 2024 the Windhoek High Court ruled the ban on homosexual acts between men to be unconstitutional.[132] In November 2018, it was reported that 32% of women aged 15\u201a\u00c4\u00ec49 experienced violence and domestic abuse from their spouses/partners and 29.5% of men believe that physical abuse towards their wife/partner is acceptable, although this is typically in rural areas.[133] The Namibian constitution guarantees the rights, freedoms and equal treatment of women in Namibia[134] and SWAPO, the ruling party in Namibia, has adopted a \"zebra system\", which ensures a fair balance of both genders in government and equal representation of women in the Namibian government.[135][126]"

The Bank of Namibia (BoN) is the central bank of Namibia responsible for performing all other functions ordinarily performed by a central bank. There are five BoN authorised commercial banks in Namibia: Bank Windhoek, First National Bank, Nedbank, Standard Bank and Small and Medium Enterprises Bank.[139] Namibia's economy is characterised by a divide between the formal and the informal economies, which is in part aggravated by the legacy of apartheid spatial planning.[140] The country's unemployment rate was 33.4% in 2018, with a labour force of 1,090,153.[141] As of 2023, the country has a youth unemployment rate of 38.4%,[142] one of the highest in the world. However, Namibia has a high percentage of skilled labour relative to SADC countries and have relatively low unemployment rates for skilled workers. To fight high unemployment, particularly amongst the youth, the government approved the introduction of an Internship Tax Incentive Programme aimed at incentivising employers to enroll more interns by providing an additional corporate tax deduction. The total financial implication for the Government is estimated at N$126 million. Poverty and inequality remain significant in the country. 40.9% of the population is affected by multidimensional poverty while an additional 19.2 percent is classified as vulnerable to multidimensional poverty.[19] Income disparity in the country remains one of the world's highest with a Gini coefficient of 59.1 in 2015.[21] In 2004 a labour act was passed to protect people from job discrimination stemming from pregnancy and HIV/AIDS status. In early 2010 the Government tender board announced that \"henceforth 100 per cent of all unskilled and semi-skilled labour must be sourced, without exception, from within Namibia\".[143] In 2013, global business and financial news provider Bloomberg named Namibia the top emerging market economy in Africa and the 13th best in the world. Only four African countries made the Top 20 Emerging Markets list in the March 2013 issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine, and Namibia was rated ahead of Morocco (19th), South Africa (15th), and Zambia (14th). Worldwide, Namibia also fared better than Hungary, Brazil, and Mexico. Bloomberg Markets magazine ranked the top 20 based on more than a dozen criteria. The data came from Bloomberg's own financial-market statistics, IMF forecasts and the World Bank. The countries were also rated on areas of particular interest to foreign investors: the ease of doing business, the perceived level of corruption and economic freedom. To attract foreign investment, the government has made improvement in reducing red tape resulted from excessive government regulations, making Namibia one of the least bureaucratic places to do business in the region. Facilitation payments are occasionally demanded by customs due to cumbersome and costly customs procedures.[144] Namibia is also classified as an Upper Middle Income country by the World Bank, and ranks 87th out of 185 economies in terms of ease of doing business.[145] The cost of living in Namibia is slightly above average because most goods, including cereals, need to be imported. Its capital city, Windhoek, is the 150th most expensive place in the world for expatriates to live.[146] Taxation in Namibia includes personal income tax, which is applicable to the total taxable income of an individual. All individuals are taxed at progressive marginal rates over a series of income brackets. Tax in Namibia is less than South African tax at monthly incomes greater than N$58,754, with the country's effective tax rates typically plateauing at a maximum of 30.8% while South Africa's plateaus at 37.4%.[147] This makes it favourable for wealthy South Africans to migrate to Namibia given their similar cost of living, cultures and socio-economic factors. In 2024, the government announced in its FY 2024/25 Budget Statement that personal income tax would be lowered, increasing the minimum taxable income from N$50,000 to N$100,000 and reducing taxable income in higher brackets as well.[148] The value-added tax (VAT) is applicable to most of the commodities and services, except for staple goods such as bread.[149] Despite the remote nature of much of the country, Namibia has seaports, airports, highways, well-maintained roads, infrastructure and railways (narrow-gauge). It is an important regional transportation hub for its seaports and trade with landlocked neighbouring countries. The Central Plateau already serves as a transportation corridor from the more densely populated north to South Africa, the source of four-fifths of Namibia's imports.[150]"

Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in rural areas and have a subsistence way of life. Namibia has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world, due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cashless economy. The inequality figures thus take into account people who do not actually rely on the formal economy for their survival. Although arable land accounts for <1% of Namibia, (about .97%), nearly half of the population is employed in agriculture.[150] About 4,000 commercial farmers own almost half of Namibia's arable land.[151] The United Kingdom offered about $180,000 in 2004 to help finance Namibia's land reform process, as Namibia plans to start expropriating land from white farmers to resettle landless black Namibians.[152] Germany has offered \u201a\u00c7\u00a81.1bn in 2021 over 30 years in reparations for the genocides in the early 20th century but the money will go towards infrastructure, healthcare and training programmes not land reform.[153] An agreement has been reached on the privatisation of several more enterprises in coming years, with hopes that this will stimulate much needed foreign investment, but reinvestment of environmentally derived capital has hobbled Namibian per capita income.[154] One of the fastest growing areas of economic development in Namibia is the growth of wildlife conservancies."

There have been significant investment in uranium mining and Namibia planned to become the largest exporter of uranium by 2015.[156] However, as of 2019 Namibia continued to produce 750 tons of uranium annually making it a smaller than average exporter in the competitive world market.[157] Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds.[158] While Namibia is known predominantly for its gem diamond and uranium deposits, a number of other minerals are extracted industrially such as lead, tungsten, gold, tin, fluorspar, manganese, marble, copper and zinc. There are offshore gas deposits in the Atlantic Ocean that are planned to be extracted in the future.[159] According to \"The Diamond Investigation\", a book about the global diamond market, from 1978, De Beers, the largest diamond company, bought most of the Namibian diamonds, and would continue to do so, because \"whatever government eventually comes to power they will need this revenue to survive\".[160] Although much of the world's diamond supply comes from what have been called African blood diamonds, Namibia has managed to develop a diamond mining industry largely free of the kinds of conflict, extortion, and murder that have plagued many other African nations with diamond mines. This has been attributed to political dynamics, economic institutions, grievances, political geography, and the effects of neighbourhoods, and is the result of a joint agreement between the government and De Beers that has led to a taxable base, strengthening state institutions.[161] Estimates updated in 2022 suggest that two exploration wells in the offshore Orange Basin could hold 2 and 3 billion barrels of oil, respectively. The expected revenue could transform Namibia's domestic economy and facilitate sustainable development goals.[162] Domestic supply voltage is 220 V AC. Electricity is generated mainly by thermal and hydroelectric power plants. Non-conventional methods of electricity generation also play some role. Encouraged by the rich uranium deposits, in 2010 the Namibian government planned to erect its first nuclear power station by 2018. Uranium enrichment was also envisaged to take place locally.[163]"

Sport and trophy hunting is also a large and growing component of the Namibian economy, accounting for 14% of total tourism in the year 2000, or 19.6\u00a0million U.S. dollars, with Namibia boasting numerous species sought after by international sport hunters.[166] In addition, extreme sports such as sandboarding, skydiving and 4x4ing have become popular, and many cities have companies that provide tours.[citation needed] The most visited places include the capital city of Windhoek, Caprivi Strip, Fish River Canyon, Sossusvlei, the Skeleton Coast Park, Sesriem, Etosha Pan and the coastal towns of Swakopmund, Walvis Bay and L\u221a\u00baderitz.[167] Windhoek plays a very important role in Namibia's tourism due to its central location and close proximity to Hosea Kutako International Airport. According to The Namibia Tourism Exit Survey, which was produced by the Millennium Challenge Corporation for the Namibian Directorate of Tourism, 56% of all tourists visiting Namibia in 2012\u201a\u00c4\u00ec13 visited Windhoek.[168] Many of Namibia's tourism related parastatals and governing bodies such as Namibia Wildlife Resorts and the Namibia Tourism Board as well as Namibia's tourism-related trade associations such as the Hospitality Association of Namibia are headquartered in Windhoek.[169] There are also a number of notable hotels in Windhoek, such as Windhoek Country Club Resort, and some international hotel chains, such as Hilton Hotels and Resorts. Namibia's primary tourism related governing body, the Namibia Tourism Board (NTB), was established by an Act of Parliament: the Namibia Tourism Board Act, 2000 (Act 21 of 2000). Its primary objectives are to regulate the tourism industry and to market Namibia as a tourist destination.[170] There are also a number of trade associations that represent the tourism sector in Namibia, such as the Federation of Namibia Tourism Associations (the umbrella body for all tourism associations in Namibia), the Hospitality Association of Namibia, the Association of Namibian Travel Agents, Car Rental Association of Namibia and the Tour and Safari Association of Namibia.[171]"

A large part of the population can not, however, make use of these resources due to the prohibitively high consumption cost and the long distance between residences and water points in rural areas.[172] As a result, many Namibians prefer the traditional wells over the available water points far away.[173] Compared to the efforts made to improve access to safe water, Namibia is lagging behind in the provision of adequate sanitation.[174] This includes 298 schools that have no toilet facilities.[175] Over 50% of child deaths are related to lack of water, sanitation, or hygiene; 23% are due to diarrhea alone. The UN has identified a \"sanitation crisis\" in the country.[173] Apart from residences for upper and middle class households, sanitation is insufficient in most residential areas. Private flush toilets are too expensive for virtually all residents in townships due to their water consumption and installation cost. As a result, access to improved sanitation has not increased much since independence: in Namibia's rural areas 13% of the population had more than basic sanitation, up from 8% in 1990. Many of Namibia's inhabitants have to resort to \"flying toilets\", plastic bags to defecate into, which after use are flung into the bush.[176] The use of open areas close to residential land for urination and defecation is very common[177] and has been identified as a major health hazard.[175]"

After independence the first Population and Housing Census was carried out in 1991; further rounds followed in 2001, 2011, and 2023 (delayed two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and financial constraints).[181] The data collection method is to count every person resident in Namibia on the census reference night, wherever they happen to be. This is called the de facto method.[182] For enumeration purposes the country is demarcated into 4,042 enumeration areas. These areas do not overlap with constituency boundaries to get reliable data for election purposes as well.[183] The 2011 Population and Housing Census counted 2,113,077 inhabitants. Between 2001 and 2011 the annual population growth was 1.4%, down from 2.6% in the previous ten-year period.[184] In 2023, the Namibia Statistics Agency conducted another census, which counted 3,022,401 inhabitants.[185]"

Although their proportion of the population decreased after independence due to emigration and lower birth rates, they still form the second-largest population of European ancestry, both in terms of percentage and actual numbers, in Sub-Saharan Africa (after South Africa).[187] The majority of Namibian whites and nearly all those who are of mixed race speak Afrikaans and share similar origins, culture, and religion as the white and coloured populations of South Africa. A large minority of whites (around 30,000) trace their family origins back to the German settlers who colonised Namibia prior to the South African invasion during the First World War, and they maintain German cultural and educational institutions. Nearly all Portuguese settlers came to the country from the former Portuguese colony of Angola.[188] The 1960 census reported 526,004 persons in what was then South West Africa, including 73,464 whites (14%).[189]"

In 1998, there were 400,325 Namibian students in primary school and 115,237 students in secondary schools. The pupil-teacher ratio in 1999 was estimated at 32:1, with about 8% of the GDP being spent on education. Curriculum development, educational research, and professional development of teachers is centrally organised by the National Institute for Educational Development (NIED) in Okahandja.[190] Among sub-Saharan African countries, Namibia has one of the highest literacy rates.[191] According to CIA World Factbook, as of 2018 91.5% of the population age 15 and over can read and write.[191] Most schools in Namibia are state-run, but there are some private schools, which are also part of the country's education system. There are four teacher training universities, three colleges of agriculture, a police training college, and three universities: University of Namibia (UNAM), International University of Management (IUM) and Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST). Namibia was ranked 96th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[192][193] The 2018 Namibia Labour Force Survey indicates that 99,536 people within the working age population had tertiary education of any level (6.6% of the working age population), while 21,922 (1.5% of the working age population) of these had postgraduate education. The following table shows the 2018 Namibia Labour Force Survey employment statistics by education. Employment rates in Namibia generally increase with education status. A high school education typically ensures greater employment rates than those with no education or those with primary or junior secondary education as their highest achievement. Namibians with a university certificate, diploma or degree have a significantly higher employment rate at 76.4%, while postgraduate education holders are most likely to be employed with an employment rate of 83.8% in 2018.[194]"

Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 12 of its major languages official status), which it saw as \"a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation.\"[198] Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as Namibia's sole official language, though only 2.3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system, especially the state broadcaster NBC.[199] Some other languages have received semi-official recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. Private schools are expected to follow the same policy as state schools, and \"English language\" is a compulsory subject.[199] Some critics argue that, as in other postcolonial African societies, the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school drop-outs and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low.[200] According to the latest statistical data gathered in the most recent survey (2016), the linguistic landscape in the region has witnessed notable shifts since the 2011 census. Oshiwambo remains the predominant language, claiming the position of the most spoken language for a significant 49.7% of households, surpassing its previous standing. KhoeKhoegowab follows at 11.0%, while the Kavango Languages, with a share of 10.4%, have also experienced a noteworthy increase. Afrikaans, identified as the country's lingua franca, maintains a considerable presence at 9.4%. The Herero Languages account for 9.2%, indicating a slight adjustment from the previous census. Silozi has seen a shift to 4.9%, and English, utilized primarily as a second language, stands at 2.3%. Other Languages collectively represent 1.0%, with San Languages at 0.7%, and German at 0.6%. The diversity of languages in the region is further demonstrated by the presence of Other African Languages at 0.5%, Setswana at 0.3%, and Other European Languages at 0.1%.[201] Note: (1) Herero languages include: Otjiherero, Otjimbanderu, Oruzemba, Otjizimba, Otjihakahona, Otjindongona and Otjitjavikwa (2) Kavango languages include:\u00a0 Rukwangali, Rushambyu, Rugciriku, Thimbukushu, Rumanyo and Rukavango Most of the white population speaks English, Afrikaans or German. More than a century after the end of the German colonial era, German continues to play a role as a commercial language. As a home language, Afrikaans is spoken by 60% of the white community, German by 32%, English by 7% and Portuguese by 4\u201a\u00c4\u00ec5%.[187] Geographical proximity to Portuguese-speaking Angola explains the relatively high number of Portuguese speakers; in 2011 these were estimated to number 100,000.[202]"

The Demographic and Health Survey (2013) summarises findings on elevated blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity: The HIV epidemic remains a public health issue in Namibia despite significant achievements made by the Ministry of Health and Social Services to expand HIV treatment services.[208] In 2001, there were an estimated 210,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, and the estimated death toll in 2003 was 16,000. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, the epidemic in Namibia \"appears to be leveling off.\"[209] As the HIV/AIDS epidemic has reduced the working-aged population, the number of orphans has increased. It falls to the government to provide education, food, shelter and clothing for these orphans.[210] A Demographic and Health Survey with an HIV biomarker was completed in 2013 Archived 18 June 2019 at the Wayback Machine and served as the fourth comprehensive, national-level population and health survey conducted in Namibia as part of the global Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programme.

However, as in other countries, there is still mentionable influence of representatives of state and economy on media in Namibia.[221] In 2009, Namibia dropped to position 36 on the Press Freedom Index.[222] In 2013, it was 19th,[223] 22nd in 2014[224] and 23rd in 2019,[225] meaning that it is currently the highest ranked African country in terms of press freedom. Although Namibia's population is fairly small, the country has a diverse choice of media; two TV stations, 19 radio stations (without counting community stations), 5 daily newspapers, several weeklies and special publications compete for the attention of the audience. Additionally, a mentionable amount of foreign media, especially South African, is available. Online media are mostly based on print publication contents. Namibia has a state-owned Press Agency, called NAMPA.[221] Overall c. 300 journalists work in the country.[226] The first newspaper in Namibia was the German-language Windhoeker Anzeiger, founded 1898. During German rule, the newspapers mainly reflected the living reality and the view of the white German-speaking minority. The black majority was ignored or depicted as a threat. During South African rule, the white bias continued, with mentionable influence of the Pretoria government on the South West African media system. Independent newspapers were seen as a menace to the existing order, and critical journalists were often threatened.[221][227][228] Current daily newspapers are the private publications The Namibian (English and other languages), Die Republikein (Afrikaans), Allgemeine Zeitung (German) and Namibian Sun (English) as well as the state-owned New Era (predominantly English). Except for the largest newspaper, The Namibian, which is owned by a trust, the other mentioned private newspapers are part of Democratic Media Holdings.[221] Other mentionable newspapers are the tabloid Informant\u221a\u00a9 owned by TrustCo, the weekly Windhoek Observer, the weekly Namibia Economist, as well as the regional Namib Times. Current affairs magazines include Insight Namibia, Vision2030 Focus magazine[citation needed] and Prime FOCUS.

The seventh tropical cyclone and the fourth named storm of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Dalila developed from a tropical wave located well southwest of Mexico on July\u00a022. Initially, northeasterly shear caused the depression to remain disorganized, though by early on July\u00a024, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dalila. During the next twenty-four hours, Dalila strengthened slightly further while tracking steadily northwestward, attaining peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) early on the following day. Shortly thereafter, Dalila either crossed or moved very close to Socorro Island on July\u00a025. Due to decreasing sea surface temperatures, the storm slowly began to weaken, after curving west-northwestward. Early on July\u00a027, Dalila was downgraded to a tropical depression, several hours before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area. Despite its close passage to Socorro Island near peak intensity, no impact was reported. On the mainland of Mexico, the outer rainbands of Dalila dropped heavy rainfall, especially in Baja California Sur, Jalisco, with more than 16 inches (410\u00a0mm) of precipitation in some areas. The worst flooding occurred in Jalisco, where streets were inundated with more than 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) of water, causing many car accidents. Additionally, 50\u00a0homes were destroyed, leaving approximately 200\u00a0people homeless. Eleven fatalities were confirmed, all of them occurred in Jalisco, most of which from drowning. Portions of Baja California Sur also experienced heavy rains from Dalila and its remnants, though no flooding was reported."

Shortly thereafter, it passed over or very close to Socorro Island.[1] Later on July\u00a025, Dalila curved west-northwestward and began entering a region of colder sea surface temperatures, resulting in weakening as the cloud pattern became less organized.[10] Due to the quick deterioration of the storm, the National Hurricane Center noted that, \"Dalila is winding down faster than anticipated\".[11] Early on July\u00a027, it weakened to a tropical depression.[1] Later that day, the storm became devoid of deep convection for over 12\u00a0hours. As a result, the National Hurricane Center ceased advisories on Dalila late on July\u00a027,[12] since it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area while located about 460 miles (740\u00a0km) west of the southern tip of Baja California. The remnant low moved west-northwestward during the next few days and then curved west-southwestward on July\u00a029. It drifted southward on July\u00a030 and dissipated about 700 miles (1,100\u00a0km) west of the southern tip of Baja California later that day.[1]"

The fifth fatality also resulted from drowning near a hydroelectric plant.[18][19] Four people were killed after a train derailed on a flooded track. Five other people were injured by the crash, two of which were critically injured.[17] Flood waters up to 6.6\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) covered numerous roads, stranding 45\u00a0vehicles and resulting in 75\u00a0accidents,[17][20] which caused at least 25\u00a0injuries.[17] About 50\u00a0homes were destroyed by the storm in Jalisco, leaving approximately 200\u00a0people homeless.[20] There was also significant flooding in Michoac\u00e1n, where up to 15.75 inches (400\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell in the city of Zamora. City officials reported that 10\u00a0neighborhoods were flooded. In rural areas of Michoac\u00e1n, a combination of heavy rains and hail destroyed about 40\u00a0homes.[21] Offshore the city of Acapulco in Guerrero, several waterspouts were spawned.[22] As the storm weakened, it produced rough seas and heavy rains over parts of Baja California Sur.[23] Although Dalila passed over Socorro Island with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), there were no reports of any deaths or damage.[1] Following the storm, the Government of Mexico supplied the affected residents with special care, blankets, and cardboard sheets.[24]"

        "content": " The 2007 Pacific hurricane season was a well below-average Pacific hurricane season, featuring only one major hurricane. The season officially started on May\u00a015 in the eastern Pacific and on June\u00a01 in the central Pacific, and ended on November 30; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the region. The first tropical cyclone of the season, Alvin, developed on May\u00a027, while the final system of the year, Kiko, dissipated on October\u00a023. Due to unusually strong wind shear, activity fell short of the long-term average, with a total of 11 named storms, 4 hurricanes, and 1 major hurricane. At the time, 2007 featured the second-lowest value of the Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index since reliable records began in 1971. Two tropical cyclones \u2013 Cosme and Flossie \u2013 crossed into the central Pacific basin during the year, activity below the average of 4 to 5 systems. Impact during the season was relatively minimal. In early June, Tropical Storm Barbara moved ashore just northwest of the Mexico\u2013Guatemala border, causing $55 million (2007 USD)[nb 1] in damage and 4 deaths. In late July, Cosme passed south of the island of Hawaii as a weakening tropical depression; light rain and increased surf resulted. A few days later, Dalila passed offshore the coastline of southwestern Mexico, killing 11 and causing minimal damage. Hurricane Flossie followed a similar track to Cosme in mid-August, producing gusty winds and light precipitation in Hawaii. Hurricane Henriette in early September produced torrential rainfall in southwestern Mexico, killing 6 and causing $25 million in damage. Baja California received moderate rains from Hurricane Ivo in mid-September, though no damage nor fatalities were reported. In mid-October, Tropical Storm Kiko passed just offshore the coastline of southwestern Mexico. Though no deaths were reported on the Mexico mainland, the storm capsized a ship with 30 people on board, 15 of whom were recovered dead, and 9 of whom were reported missing. Overall, the season ended with $80 million in damage and 49 deaths."

Below-average activity was expected as a result of either ENSO-Neutral or La Ni\u00f1a conditions, as well as the continuation of the reduction in activity beginning in 1995.[1][2]"

        "content": "The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 2007 Pacific hurricane season (Eastern Pacific and Central Pacific combined) as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the National Hurricane Center was 51.6\u00a0units,[nb 2][4] which was a well below the 1981\u20132010 average of 113.3 units, and at the time the second-lowest value observed since reliable records began in 1971.[5] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h). Tropical cyclone activity totaled to eleven named storms, four hurricanes, and only major hurricane within the season; all three of these values fall below the 1971\u20132006 long-term average of 15 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. The main contributing factor to below-average activity was much above-average wind shear across the Pacific basin.[6] In May\u00a02007, two tropical storms \u2013 Alvin and Barbara \u2013 developed, marking at the time the third such instance of more than one tropical storm developing within the month since official records began in 1949.[7] In June\u00a02007, only one tropical depression developed in the East Pacific basin, making 2007 one of only four years in which a tropical storm did not form in the month.[8] By the following month, in terms of ACE, 2007 was considered the third quietest year-to-date since the satellite era began in 1966;[9] in September, the season fell to the second quietest year-to-date.[10] Below-average activity continued for the remainder of the year."

        "content": "The genesis of Alvin can be attributed to a tropical wave that crossed Dakar, Africa on May\u00a09. The wave remained poorly organized as it moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea through mid-May. On May\u00a020, the disturbance crossed Central America and emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean, where convection\u2014shower and thunderstorm activity\u2014gradually began to increase over the well-defined center; this led to the formation of a tropical depression by 0000\u00a0UTC on May\u00a027, approximately 345\u00a0mi (555\u00a0km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. Following designation, the depression was slow to organize as a result of moderate easterly shear; by 0000\u00a0UTC on May\u00a029, however, the system had gained enough organization to be considered a tropical storm. After attaining its peak intensity with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1003\u00a0mbar (1003\u00a0hPa; 29.6\u00a0inHg), increasingly stable air and higher wind shear caused Alvin to begin a weakening trend. At 0600\u00a0UTC on May\u00a030, it weakened to a tropical depression, and by 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a01, Alvin degenerated into a non-convective remnant low. The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation six days later.[11]"

After re-intensifying into a tropical storm for a second time six hours later, Barbara attained its peak intensity with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000\u00a0mbar (1000\u00a0hPa; 30\u00a0inHg) at 1800\u00a0UTC. Drifting northeast, the storm maintained this intensity until landfall just northwest of the Mexico-Guatemala border at 1300\u00a0UTC on June\u00a02. Rapid weakening ensued thereafter, with the system weakening to a tropical depression at 1800\u00a0UTC. The low-level circulation dissipated six hours later, marking the dissipation of Barbara.[12] Heavy rainfall exceeding 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) caused many rivers to swell.[14] An unspecified island was separated from the Mexico mainland after the bridge connecting the two was washed away, stranding dozens of families.[15] In El Salvador, significant flooding killed four people.[16] Gusts peaked at 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) at an automated weather station in Puerto Madero, Chiapas.[17] Across the affected regions, these winds caused damage limited to house roofs and trees.[12] Barbara caused severe crop damage totaling to 200 million pesos (2007 MXN; $55 million).[18] About a hundred residents were forced to evacuate after the storm destroyed a dozen palm huts in Guatemala.[15]"

Initially embedded within the ITCZ, development was slow until the system's convection increased on July\u00a013. A day later, the NHC classified it as Tropical Depression Six-E about midway between Mexico and Hawaii. Although wind shear was light, ocean temperatures were marginal for intensification, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cosme on July\u00a015, while moving generally northwestward.[25][26] Following the development of a curved convection band and appearance of an eye on satellite,[27] Cosme was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane at 1800\u00a0UTC the next day, about 1,600\u00a0mi (2,600\u00a0km) east of Hilo, Hawaii; it is at this time that the hurricane attained its peak with winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987\u00a0mbar (987\u00a0hPa; 29.1\u00a0inHg). Cosme tracked westward over cooler waters, causing the system to weaken quickly back to tropical storm strength. At 1800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018, Cosme weakened to a tropical depression after crossing into the central Pacific.[25] Gradually weakening, Tropical Depression Cosme passed south of the Hawaiian Islands on July 20 with a minimum central pressure of 1010\u00a0mbar.[28] By late on July\u00a022, Cosme degenerated into a remnant low near Johnston Island. The circulation dissipated three days later.[29][25] Cosme was initially forecast to pass over Hawaii at tropical storm strength.[30][31] In anticipation of the storm, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the island of Hawaii on July 20, and a small craft advisory and high surf advisory for Maui and Hawaii.[32] The Hawaii County Civil Defense opened evacuation centers,[33] while county crews cleaned out drains and culverts to prevent flooding.[34] Because the depression stayed far from land, the effects were mostly minor.[25] Rain bands produced 6.94\u00a0in (176\u00a0mm) of rainfall in Hakalau,[35] causing small stream and drainage ditch flooding, as well as ponding on roadways in portions of Hilo, Puna, and Kau.[36] The rainfall helped to relieve a persistent drought which had existed for several months. Wind gusts reached 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) in southern portions of Hawaii.[37] A strong trade wind swell north of Cosme generated waves up to 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) high.[38]"

Following formation, moderate northeasterly shear inhibited significant development, causing the system to remain a tropical depression for 48 hours. A mid-level ridge over Mexico caused the system to turn northwest as shear began to decrease; at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dalila.

Continuing westward and crossing into the central Pacific basin, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to its peak intensity with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 949\u00a0mbar (949\u00a0hPa; 28.0\u00a0inHg) at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, while positioned roughly 980\u00a0mi (1,580\u00a0km) east-southeast of the Big Island. Increased wind shear the next day caused Flossie to begin a slow weakening trend thereafter; at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014, the system weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane, and by 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, the cyclone was barely a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Six hours later, it weakened to a tropical storm as the low-level center became exposed on satellite. Flossie weakened to a tropical depression early on September\u00a016 and dissipated by 1800\u00a0UTC.[47] In preparation for the cyclone, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Big Island.[48] A tropical storm warning was subsequently issued for the same location,[49] The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent 20 transportation, public works, and health experts to the region.[50] Many schools were closed, including the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College; as a result, an estimated 26,000 college students were sent home.[51] As a weakening cyclone, Flossie produced light precipitation on the island of Hawaii. Large waves impacted south-facing beaches while the maximum sustained wind observed reached 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) at South Point.[52] No fatalities were reported."

After the formation of deep convection over the center and associated convective bands, the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029.[53] Though the circulation remained positioned on the northeast side of most thunderstorm activity, satellite intensity estimates supported tropical storm strength and it was upgraded to such accordingly.[54] At 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030, Gil attained its peak intensity with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1001\u00a0mbar (1001\u00a0hPa; 29.6\u00a0inHg).

Moving west-northwest around a ridge positioned over inland Mexico, the center passed narrowly offshore after producing squally weather along the coastline. The system moved westward while continuing to intensify, becoming a Category\u00a01 hurricane at 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04 and subsequently attaining its peak intensity with winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (972\u00a0hPa; 28.7\u00a0inHg) six hours later. An approaching upper-level trough caused Henriette to turn northwest later that day, moving it ashore near San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo, Mexico at 2100\u00a0UTC as a minimal hurricane. After crossing Baja California Sur, Henriette weakened to a tropical storm and made a second landfall near Guaymas, Mexico. The system moved inland and quickly weakened, dissipating by 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06.[56] The hardest hit city by Henriette was Acapulco, where heavy rains led to rockslides and mudslides that killed six.[57] In Sonora, the hurricane damaged thousands of structures and killed four, two of whom off the coast.[58][59] Farther northwest, a woman died while attempting to surf waves off the coast of Baja California Sur.[60] Heavy rains stranded many cars while causing rivers to overflow, flooding communities.[61] Damage totaled to $275 million (2007 MXN; $25 million).[56]"

Tracking west-northwestward as a result of the mid-level ridge,[64] the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ivo at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019. Turning northwest, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite, prompting the NHC to upgrade the system to a Category\u00a01 hurricane 24 hours later. With an area of deep convection near the center,[65] the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984\u00a0mbar (984\u00a0hPa; 29.1\u00a0inHg) at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a021. Westerly flow associated with a large upper-level low began to undercut the outflow of Ivo, and it weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon hours.[62] The convective pattern rapidly deteriorated due to southeasterly wind shear,[66] and despite a brief burst of convection,[67] the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression to the west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California at 0000\u00a0UTC on September 23. Associated deep convection dissipated later that day as Ivo turned eastward, and the system degenerated into a remnant low accordingly. The remnant low dissipated two days later as it continued in the same direction.[62] Initially, some forecasts predicted the storm would strike the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm;[68] a tropical storm watch was briefly issued from Santa Fe to Cabo San Lucas accordingly.[62] Over 100 shelters were opened in the municipalities of Los Cabos, La Paz and Comond\u00fa, respectively.[69] In all, Ivo contributed to heavy rainfall across Baja California Sur; however, damage was not reported.[62]"

After interacting with a secondary wave over the central Atlantic a few days later, it entered the eastern Caribbean, becoming steadily better defined. Convective activity was enhanced as the wave passed into the West Caribbean on September\u00a022 and it moved inland over Central American shortly thereafter. A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September\u00a027 and convection steadily increased; around 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Juliette.

Despite strong easterly wind shear, the system acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression at 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015. Within a broad cyclonic gyre, the system moved erratically, first drifting south then east-northeast and eventually northwest. Early on October\u00a016, the system briefly intensified into a tropical storm as a convective band wrapped around the circulation, but continued strong shear caused associated convection to dissipate and the system weakened to a tropical depression by 1800\u00a0UTC. After intensifying back to a tropical storm the following day, a brief reprieve in harsh upper-level winds allowed Kiko to reach its peak intensity with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 991\u00a0mbar (991\u00a0hPa; 29.3\u00a0inHg). An increase in southerly shear and entrance into a more stable airmass caused the system to weaken to a tropical depression at 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a023; the system degenerated into a remnant low 24 hours later. The remnant low tracked west before turning north and eventually dissipated early on October\u00a027.[73] Beginning early on October\u00a018, Kiko was forecast to strike Mexico at tropical storm intensity and cyclone advisories were issued accordingly.[74] However, a building mid-level ridge of high pressure over inland Mexico was then forecast to cause the center of circulation to pass just offshore.[75] Though no damage was reported in association with the cyclone, rough seas created by Kiko capsized a ship with thirty people on board; two were found still alive, fifteen bodies were recovered, and nine were reported missing.[76]"

The floods, which followed heavy rain across southeastern Australia in early September 2010, caused the inundation of about 250 homes, hundreds of evacuations and millions of dollars of damage.[1][2] Weather warnings were initially issued for Victoria on Thursday 2 September and rain began to fall on the Friday, continuing through the weekend to Tuesday. Heavy rain fell in most regions of the state, particularly at higher altitudes in the state's west and northeast, flooding the upper reaches of many of Victoria's major rivers. A state of emergency was declared with State Emergency Service crews arriving from Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania.[3] The floods proceeded an extensive drought period that had effected the entirety of Australia. While the flooding was widespread, swelling many major rivers, little flash flooding occurred in urban areas. Melbourne remained relatively unaffected, though several large regional towns, such as Ballarat, Benalla and others, experienced urban flooding. The heavy rainfall and flooding was accompanied by wind gusts of up to 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) in the state's southeast and Melbourne's eastern suburbs. The highest rainfall was recorded at Mount Buffalo, with 180\u00a0mm (7.08\u00a0in) recorded between Saturday and Sunday (4 and 5 September). Authorities expected floodwaters to move downstream, affecting further towns and regions over the following days.

The system quickly split off from the parent low, and over the next couple of days, the storm moved southeastward while gradually intensifying, before reaching a peak intensity of 980 millibars (29\u00a0inHg) on March 6.[6] Afterward, the storm stalled off the coast of the Pacific Northwest for the next couple of days, while weakening, with the storm shedding its frontal system and weakening to 1,000 millibars (30\u00a0inHg) by 09:00 UTC on March 8.[7][8] On the next day, the storm slowly began to approach the West Coast, while developing multiple central lows in the process.[9] On March 10, the storm began moving ashore in California, while developing a new low-pressure center to the east, which became the dominant low by the next day, after the storm had moved inland.[10][11][12] The storm remained nearly stationary over the Western United States for another day, before resuming its eastward motion on March 12, as a disorganized storm system.[13] On the next day, the storm began approaching another system over the Central Plains while gradually strengthening, before merging with it early on March 14, with the winter storm organizing significantly and growing more powerful in the process.[14][15] On the night of March 13\u201314, a powerful low-level jet stream channeled large amounts of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico across the Southern Plains and into the storm, which enhanced precipitation from the storm and also contributed to the strengthening of the system.[1] On March 14, the winter storm developed a secondary low at the triple point of its occluded front, as the storm expanded in size. Later that day, the storm's central pressure reached a secondary peak of 998 millibars (29.5\u00a0inHg), while the storm was situated over the Central United States, with the center of low pressure being situated over southeastern Colorado.[16][17] For much of that day, the storm's central low remained nearly stationary, even as it was intensifying. The storm's cyclogenesis resulted in a tightening of the pressure gradient, which gave the storm a large and expansive wind field.[1] Afterward, the storm gradually began to weaken as it slowly moved eastward, even as it continued expanding in size. The storm's eastern flank continued moving farther apart from the parent low during this time.[18] From March 14 to 15, another extratropical cyclone moving in from the Pacific Northwest helped speed up the storm's eastward motion.[1] Throughout March 15, the winter storm weakened significantly, with the storm's western flank breaking off into a new storm over Northern United States, while the storm's secondary low to the east dissipated. The storm reached the Southeastern United States and the Mid-Atlantic region on March 16, even as the storm grew increasingly disorganized, with the storm's central pressure rising to 1,012 millibars (29.9\u00a0inHg) by 18:00 UTC that day.[19][20] On March 17, the majority of the moisture from the winter storm was absorbed into a new storm developing off the coast of the Carolinas, as the former storm's low-pressure center stalled over West Virginia.

Forming out of an area of low pressure on July\u00a09, Soudelor failed to maintain deep convection around its center for the duration of its existence. On July\u00a010, the depression brushed the northern Philippines and intensified into a tropical storm on July\u00a011. Later that day, the storm crossed the Leizhou Peninsula. The last public advisory from the JMA was issued the following day after Soudelor made landfall in southern China. In the Philippines, Soudelor produced severe flooding that killed one person and resulted in the issuance of a state of calamity. The storm later killed 15 people in southern China after a group of hikers were washed away in a flash flood on Hainan Island. In Vietnam, rainfall up to 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) caused widespread flooding, and lightning triggered by the storm killed two people in the country."

        "content": " The Yellowstone fires of 1988 collectively formed the largest wildfire in the recorded history of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Starting as many smaller individual fires, the flames quickly spread out of control due to drought conditions and increasing winds, combining into several large conflagrations which burned for several months. The fires almost destroyed two major visitor destinations and, on September 8, 1988, the entire park was closed to all non-emergency personnel for the first time in its history.[6] Only the arrival of cool and moist weather in the late autumn brought the fires to an end. A total of 793,880 acres (3,213\u00a0km2), or 36\u00a0percent of the park, burned at varying levels of severity.[3] At the peak of the firefighting effort, more than 9,000 firefighters were assigned to the fires in the park, assisted by dozens of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft which were used for water and fire retardant drops. With fires raging throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and other areas in the western United States, the staffing levels of the National Park Service and other land management agencies were inadequate for the situation; more than 4,000 U.S. military personnel were soon brought in to assist in wildfire suppression efforts. The firefighting effort cost $120\u00a0million ($310\u00a0million in 2024).[4] Structure losses were minimized by concentrating firefighting efforts near major visitor areas, and eventually totaled $3.28\u00a0million ($8\u00a0million as of 2024).[7] No firefighters died while fighting the Yellowstone fires, though there were two fire-related deaths outside the park. Before the late 1960s, fires were generally believed to be detrimental to parks and forests, and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as quickly as possible. However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades prior to 1988, a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires. In contrast, in 1988, Yellowstone was overdue for a large fire, and, in the exceptionally dry summer, many smaller \"controlled\" fires combined. The fires burned discontinuously, leaping from one patch to another, leaving intervening areas untouched. Intense fires swept through some regions, burning everything in their paths. Tens of millions of trees and countless plants were killed by the wildfires, and some regions were left looking blackened and dead. However, more than half of the affected areas were burned by ground fires, which did less damage to hardier tree species. Not long after the fires ended, plant and tree species quickly reestablished themselves, and native plant regeneration has been highly successful. The Yellowstone fires of 1988 were unprecedented in the history of the National Park Service and led to many questions about existing fire management policies. Media accounts of mismanagement were often sensational and inaccurate, sometimes wrongly reporting or implying that most of the park was being destroyed.[citation needed] While there were temporary declines in air quality during the fires, no adverse long-term health effects have been recorded in the ecosystem and, contrary to initial reports, few large mammals were killed by the fires, though there was a subsequent reduction in the number of moose."

        "content": "In the eastern United States, with its significant rainfall, wildfires are relatively small and have rarely posed a great risk to life and property. As white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large-scale fires were encountered. Range fires on the Great Plains and forest fires in the Rocky Mountains are larger and more destructive than in the east.[8] A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies.[3] The worst loss of life in United States history due to a wildfire occurred in 1871 when the Peshtigo Fire swept through Wisconsin, killing more than 1,200 people.[9] The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 in California and especially the Great Fire of 1910 in Montana and Idaho contributed to the philosophy that fire was a danger that needed to be suppressed.[10][11] The Great Fire of 1910 burned 3,000,000 acres (12,000\u00a0km2), destroyed a number of communities, and killed 86 people; this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize wildfire suppression.[12] Prior to the 1960s, U.S. Government land agencies, including the National Park Service, generally followed the fire management policies established by the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees the majority of the nation's forestlands. That policy was to suppress all wildland fires.[13] Before the middle of the 20th century, most forest managers believed that fires should be suppressed at all times.[14] By 1935, the U.S. Forest Service's fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by 10\u00a0a.m. the morning after they were first spotted.[15] Firefighting crews were established throughout public lands and generally staffed by young men during fire seasons. By 1940, firefighters known as smokejumpers would parachute out of airplanes to extinguish flames in remote locations. By the beginning of World War II, more than 8,000 fire lookout towers had been constructed in the United States. Though many have been torn down due to increased use of airplanes for fire spotting, two are still used each year in Yellowstone.[16] Firefighting efforts were highly successful, with the area burned by wildfires reduced from an annual average of 30,000,000 acres (120,000\u00a0km2) during the 1930s, to between 2,000,000 acres (8,100\u00a0km2) and 5,000,000 acres (20,000\u00a0km2) by the 1960s.[14] The need for lumber during World War II was high and fires that destroyed timberland were deemed unacceptable. In 1944, the U.S. Forest Service developed an ad campaign to help educate the public that all fires were detrimental, using a cartoon black bear named Smokey Bear. This iconic firefighting bear can still be seen on posters with the catchphrase \"Only you can prevent forest fires\".[17] Early posters of Smokey Bear misled the public into believing that western wildfires were predominantly human-caused. However, in Yellowstone, 78\u00a0percent of fires are caused by lightning, while only 22\u00a0percent are human-caused.[18] However, some researchers in the 20th century argued that this policy should be changed, on the grounds that wildfires clean out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk.[19][20] As early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. Over the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred regarding the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems. In 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released the Leopold Report, officially known as Wildlife Management in the National Parks, recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks.[21] The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems.[11] By 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies that reflected new research. The service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property. The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions, controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems.[15] From 1972, the National Park Service began allowing natural fires in Yellowstone to burn under controlled conditions. Fires of this type were referred to as prescribed natural fires. Between 1972 and 1987, a total of 235 prescribed natural fires burned a relatively small 33,759 acres (137\u00a0km2) under the directives of the new policy.[22] Of these, only 15 spread to more than 100 acres (0.4\u00a0km2).[18] The five years prior to 1988 were much wetter than normal and this may have reduced the area of the fires during that period.[22]"

        "content": "Formal fire record-keeping in Yellowstone began in 1931, when the Heart Lake Fire burned 18,000 acres (73\u00a0km2). Despite its small extent, it was the largest fire in the period from when the park was created until 1988. Research indicates that only two or three large fires occur on the Yellowstone Plateau every 1,000\u00a0years.[23][24] The previous major Yellowstone fire was in the early to mid-18th century, well before the arrival of white explorers.[1]:\u200a9 Yellowstone forests are dominated by the lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100\u00a0years as a forest matures.[25] In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established.[25] The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s, much of the lodgepole pine forests in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250\u00a0years old and approaching the end of their life cycle.[1] The mountain pine beetle killed a number of trees in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. This created a heterogeneous forest in which old surviving trees were mixed with younger trees of various ages. This mixed stand structure may have provided ladder fuels that contributed to the fires.[26] In addition, the winter season of 1987\u20131988 was drier than usual, with the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem receiving only 31\u00a0percent of the normal snowpack.[1] However, April and May 1988 were very wet and the abundant moisture greatly aided grass and understory development. By June, the rainfall stopped and little was recorded in the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the next four months. By July, the worst drought in the history of Yellowstone National Park began. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer soon turned to dry tinder. Relative humidity levels fell further, desiccating the forest. Fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5%. By mid-August, humidity levels were averaging below 20% and were recorded as low as 6% on one occasion.[1] To compound the lack of rainfall, the majority of Yellowstone's soils are rhyolitic volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention.[23] A series of strong but dry storm fronts also led to the rapid spread of a number of the largest fires.[27] Accumulated fuel, old forests, and unabated and exceptionally dry conditions spelled trouble for Yellowstone. However, foresters and fire ecologists predicted a normal fire season for the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and anticipated normal rainfall for July.[1] History provided little evidence to suggest that 1988 would be any different from the previous 100\u00a0plus years the park had existed. But, as major fires started to break out throughout the Rocky Mountain region, the media began to take notice. Twenty small fires started in Yellowstone by July and of those, eleven went out on their own. The remainder were closely monitored in accordance with the prescribed natural fire policies. By July 15, fires throughout the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem had burned 8,500 acres (34\u00a0km2) and though this was not out of the ordinary, media focus on fires raging throughout the American west influenced the decision by the park officials to initiate fire suppression efforts on July 15. Within a week of the suppression efforts commencing, the fires had spread to include almost 100,000 acres (400\u00a0km2) on the parkland alone.[18]"

Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area.[2] At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed \"Black Saturday\", more than 150,000 acres (610\u00a0km2) were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted as far away as Billings, Montana, 60 miles (97\u00a0km) to the northeast.[1] The wind-driven flames jumped roads and firelines, and burning embers caused long-range spotting, starting new fires a mile (1.6\u00a0km) or more ahead of the main fire fronts. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over 200 feet (61\u00a0m) high. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of 5 to 10 miles (8.0 to 16.1\u00a0km) a day, and there were even occasions when more than 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) in one hour were recorded.[28]"

The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone Fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first, no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.[29] The Red Fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1, and like the Shoshone Fire, advanced little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19 and combined with the Shoshone Fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area, evacuations were ordered so fire fighting crews could concentrate on structure protection. In the midst of a large lodgepole pine forest, the Grant Village complex was the first major tourist area impacted that season. A number of small structures and some of the campground complex were destroyed. The Snake River Complex of fires eventually included the Red, Shoshone, and numerous other fires.[29] The Mink Fire started in Bridger-Teton National Forest from lightning on July 11, and burned north following the Yellowstone River valley, after firefighters forced the fire away from private lands. The Mink Fire eventually burned sections inside the park after July 23 but was deemed to be low risk since it was in a very remote section of the park.[29] The third largest fire of the Snake River Complex was the Huck Fire, which started after a tree fell on a power line on August 20 near Flagg Ranch. This fire burned primarily in the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway, crossing Yellowstone's southern border on August 30.[6][1] The Snake River Complex of fires burned more than 172,000 acres (696\u00a0km2) before ending in mid-September.[1] One of the most striking events of this fire complex occurred on August 23 when intense fires swept across the Lewis River Canyon, propelled by winds of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) and gusting to 80 miles per hour (130\u00a0km/h).[30]"

Then, on August 20, the fire moved rapidly to the south also threatening the town of Cooke City, this time from the north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve the fires of combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within a hundred yards of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6.[31][32] The Storm Creek Fire ultimately burned more than 143,000 acres.[29] The other major fire located in the northern section of the park was the Hellroaring Fire. Started in Gallatin National Forest on August 15 from embers from an unattended campfire, the fire initially moved north, but then turned around a few days later and moved south, threatening the area near Tower Junction.[29] It ultimately burned 101,996 acres.[29] In the northwest, the Fan Fire started on June 25, and was originally considered a threat to the town of Gardiner, Montana, just outside the park's north entrance. It was the most successfully fought of all the 1988 fires. Though the fire was not contained for a couple of months, by mid-August, it was no longer considered a threat to lives and property.[29] The Fan Fire burned 27,346 acres in total.[29]"

The fire started on July 22, when a man cutting timber dropped his cigarette in Caribou-Targhee National Forest just outside the park's western border.[33][7] The North Fork Fire was the only major fire that was fought from the beginning since it started after the prescribed fire policy was halted on July 15.[28] The fire spread towards the northeast and by the end of the first week of August, was threatening Madison Junction and nearby campground facilities. The fire then raced towards Norris Junction on August 20. Firefighters there used water and foam to keep the structures from being consumed by the blaze. The fire continued its eastward advance along the Yellowstone Plateau, and on August 25, reached visitor facilities at Canyon, where land management agencies and the U.S. military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures. The eastern flank of the fire calmed down for several days, then down-sloping winds off the Yellowstone Plateau forced flames along the west side of the fire towards the town of West Yellowstone, Montana.[29] There, private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds of acres of forestland to protect both the town and an electrical power substation. The fire burned a substantial section of forest along the Madison River valley.[34] Between September 5 and 7, a dry front pushed flames along the southern section of the North Fork Fire towards the large Old Faithful visitor complex adjacent to the Upper Geyser Basin.[29] All non-emergency personnel were ordered to be evacuated; however, political issues influenced National Park Service management directives and the complex was not completely closed to incoming tourists, with some visitors still arriving at Old Faithful not long before the intense fire hit by mid-afternoon. An all-out aerial bombardment with air tankers dropping fire retardant failed.[28] Firefighters concentrated on structure protection, especially those of historical significance such as the Old Faithful Inn, using fire engines and portable water pumping systems to keep the roofs and other surfaces of the structures wet. 1,200 firefighters including 120 military personnel dug fire lines and cleared away brush near structures. Winds crested up to 80 miles per hour (130\u00a0km/h) as the fire approached from the west.[35] The fires spread to forested sections near to, but generally away from major structures, but 19 small structures were destroyed and there was also extensive damage to an old dormitory. The fire was so intense that vehicles left near the fire had their wheels melted, windshields shattered, and paint scorched.[28] Though most of the Old Faithful complex had been spared, the park service decided that for the first time, the entire park would be closed to non-emergency personnel on September 8. The night of the 9th and the morning of September 10, the North Fork Fire jumped a fireline along its northeastern flank and approached Mammoth Hot Springs where a large concentration of historic structures as well as the Park Headquarters is located. Rain and snow arrived in time to slow the fires before they threatened the complex. By the time the North Fork fire finally died down, it was responsible for 60% of the burned area within the park; more than 400,000 acres (1,600\u00a0km2).[6]"

        "content": "1988 was a big year for wildfires in the western United States, with more than 72,000 fires reported during the year, including 300 rated as major.[28] Firefighting employees and equipment were stretched to the limit, and consequently, more than 11,700 U.S. military personnel assisted in the firefighting efforts in Yellowstone.[1] At the height of the fires, 9,600 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to Yellowstone at one time, and by the time the fires finally went out, more than 25,000 had been involved in the fire suppression efforts.[1] Crews would normally work for two to three weeks, be sent home, and then return for one or two more tours of duty. The normal workday was as long as 14\u00a0hours.[1] Assignments included digging firelines, watering down buildings, clearing undergrowth near structures, and installing water pumps. Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews, as much of the firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures. No firefighters died in the park as a result of the fires, but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside the park.[18] A number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with the more common complaints being fatigue, headaches, and smoke inhalation. A few firefighters were exposed to noxious fumes from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area.[36] Firefighters created 665 miles (1,070\u00a0km) of fireline by hand and 137 miles (220\u00a0km) with mechanized equipment such as bulldozers.[1] Most of the bulldozer work was done on the North Fork fire.[1] Some other fires were too remote or in too steep terrain for the safe operation of heavy equipment, and bulldozers were prohibited from many areas because of the impact they have on surface features. Additionally, the thin, unstable ground near the park's geothermal features could not be trusted to support the weight of heavy equipment.[36] The use of bulldozers was a point of contention with park management and only after the fires became out of control did they permit their use to combat both the North Fork Fire as well as to protect the town West Yellowstone, Montana.[37] Some 120 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft were used to combat the inferno. Aircraft logged more than 18,000 hours of flight time and dropped 1.4\u00a0million U.S. gallons (5.3\u00a0ML) of fire retardant and 10\u00a0million U.S. gallons (38\u00a0ML) of water on the fires.[2] More than 100 fire engines were assigned to the fire.[38] Structural fire engines were used in building complexes, where a number are stationed permanently as in urban settings. Smaller wildland fire engines suitable for movement over rough terrain were deployed throughout the park.[36] $120\u00a0million was spent fighting the fires,[4] while structural losses were estimated at $3\u00a0million.[39] Later analysis has shown that, aside from concentrated fire suppression efforts near major tourist facilities, the firefighting work failed to stop what was likely an unstoppable force.[23][28] Though firefighters saved many historical structures and other infrastructure, it was the cooler and wetter conditions of autumn that finally brought the fires to an end.[3] Colder weather, bringing with it rain and snow on September 11, calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn well into the middle of November, they no longer posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones, and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.[1] By then, a total of 793,880 acres (3,213\u00a0km2), or 36\u00a0percent of the park, had been affected by the wildfires.[3][36]"

        "content": "The impact of the fires in Yellowstone was highly variable. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched.[40] There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41\u00a0percent of all the area that burned.[41] Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned one or the other as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.[41] The recovery from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing in a matter of days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted.[41] Though some small plants did not immediately re-assume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts that survived the heat from the fires. There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and five\u00a0years after the fires.[42] Seeds had little distance to travel, even in severely burned areas. Much of the most badly burned forest was within 160 to 650 feet (49 to 198\u00a0m) of less affected areas. Still, most regeneration of the plants and trees came from immediate sources, either above or below ground. Lodgepole pines generally do not disperse their seeds more than 200 feet (61\u00a0m), so seed dispersal from less burned parts apparently had little effect on more severely burned areas.[41] In regions that did experience complete burnouts, the average depth of charred soil was only about half an inch (14\u00a0mm), so few roots, even grasses, were killed by the fire. This allowed rapid regeneration throughout the ecosystem.[43] The predominant tree in Yellowstone, the lodgepole pine, fared poorly from the fires, except in areas where the heat and flames were very mild. The lodgepole pine is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire. Research of test plots established after the fires indicated that the best seed dispersal occurred in areas that had experienced severe ground fires, and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas that had only minor surface burns.[43] Regions with crown fires sometimes had the highest rates of regeneration of lodgepole pine after 5\u00a0years.[44] However, the rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform, with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less. Stands of dead lodgepole killed by the fires may persist for decades, rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife.[41] Aspen became more widespread after the fires, occupying areas that had been dominated by conifers. It had long been believed that aspen regenerated by sprouting from existing roots rather than by seed dispersal. However, aspen sprouts appeared two years after the fires as far as 9 miles (14\u00a0km) from the nearest known aspen trees. Aspen is a preferred grazing food for elk and many of the newer aspen are consequently small, except in areas that are harder for elk to get to.[43] The resurgence of aspen after the fires was a contrast to pre-fire events, as aspen had been increasingly scarce in the park.[41] Somewhat unrelated, the restoration of wolves to Yellowstone National Park beginning in 1995 may have a more positive impact on the future of aspen in the park due to the reduced population of elk because of predation by wolves and other predators.[45] Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals \u2014 surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000\u201350,000), 36 mule deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished.[18][46] Of 21 grizzlies that were radio-collared and had home ranges where the fires happened, only one was believed to have been lost. Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas the following year, feeding on the proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants that thrived due to all the dead wood.[47] Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s, but the decline became more obvious after the fires. Once numbering at approximately 1,000, by 2020 less than 200 were believed to reside in the park.[48] This has been attributed to a loss of dense fir forests that are preferred by the subspecies of moose that inhabit the park.[48] Unlike elk, which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses, moose are more likely to be browsers, consuming primarily woody food sources, particularly willow and subalpine fir, which were also reduced by the fires. All ungulates experienced high initial mortality the winter after the fires, but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than the fires themselves.[49] However, moose populations, unlike other ungulates, have not rebounded in subsequent years.[48] Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape, but also because of the reduction in forest cover, allowing would-be predators less difficulty in spotting them.[50] Approximately 100 dead fish were reported in two streams after fire retardant was accidentally dropped on them. Aside from a temporary decrease in a few species of aquatic insects, no long-term impact has been observed on aquatic life in any of Yellowstone's rivers or lakes.[51]"

        "content": "The smoke and airborne particulates from the fires posed a threat to local communities on several occasions. Smoke and particulates were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, the location of the park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels. Smoke and haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous. A number of firefighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas.[1] In the aftermath of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality.[51] Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.[36]"

Of the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed.[4] There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units. Six more structures at the Old Faithful complex were damaged but were salvaged.[36] Of the 38 backcountry patrol cabins used by park rangers and park staff, the only one lost to the fires was at Sportsman Lake, though numerous others suffered from water damage and from protective fire shelters that had been nailed on to protect them from the flames.[36] However, fires did a lot of damage to 23 out of 61 picnic areas and campgrounds, 73 hiking bridges, 10 miles (16\u00a0km) of power lines and 300 utility poles.[36] Some of the boardwalks used to keep tourists elevated above geothermal areas were also destroyed but were quickly replaced.[36] Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times of immediate danger. Firefighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non-critical personnel at least once during the fires.[1] Historic buildings and visitor centers sustained only minor losses as firefighting efforts were heavily concentrated towards structure protection. In 1989 it was reported that structure losses were valued at $3.28\u00a0million ($8\u00a0million as of 2024).[52]"

        "header": "Media coverage",
        "content": "Since Yellowstone is one of the most famous national parks in the world, news coverage was extensive and sometimes sensational. Federal officials sometimes had only limited information to present to the media. The National Park Service received some 3,000 media requests, not all of which the two park public information officers were able to grant, even with the assistance of a staff of more than 40 employees. 16 more park personnel were assigned the role of liaisons with the media where fire fighting staff power was concentrated. By the time the fires were under control in mid-November, the park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily.[1] Media coverage of the fires brought the National Park Service more national attention than it had ever received, and the 1988 fire season has been called one of the most important events in the history of that agency.[3] Lack of understanding of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies.[53] Some news agencies gave the impression that most of the park was being destroyed.[53] On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires\u2014a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies.[53] The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe.[54][55] The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, due to a lack of fuel,[1] and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained.[28] When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media were again highly critical of the park service and its policies.[55]"

        "header": "Fire management since 1988",
        "content": "As a result of research conducted after the fires, a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, as well as all human-caused fires, are to be suppressed.[56] These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.[16] The 2020-2024 Wildland Fire Strategic Plan is the latest incarnation of the National Park Service fire management policies.[57] Increased fire monitoring through ground-based and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed. Fire monitors first determine whether a fire is human-caused or natural. All human-caused fires are suppressed since they are unnatural, while natural fires are monitored. Fire monitors map the fire perimeter, record local weather, and examine the types of fuels burning and the amount of fuel available. Additionally, they investigate the rate of spread, flame lengths, fuel moisture content, and other characteristics of each fire. Monitors relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions.[16] Land management employees remove dead and hazardous fuels from areas as prioritized by the Hazard Fuels Reduction Plan. This is to ensure fires have less opportunity to threaten lives, historical structures, and visitor facilities. A 2019 directive recommends that the minimal defensive fuel reduction perimeter around structures and critical infrastructure is 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) however some of the most at risk structures may need 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) for the best protection. The directive also states that tree crowns have a 10-foot (3.0\u00a0m) space away from infrastructure and limbs pruned to not less than 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) above the ground.[58] Foresters and ecologists argue that large controlled burns in Yellowstone prior to the fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if they were allowed to burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration.[23][59] Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out.[16] Natural fires are sometimes supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions that allow firefighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.[57] Greater cooperation between federal and state agencies on a national level has been coordinated through the National Interagency Fire Center. Though primarily a collaborative effort between federal agencies to develop a national-level fire policy, the center also aids local and state governments in addressing their fire management issues. Universally accepted priorities include management directives that allow natural fires to burn unhindered under prescribed conditions. As in the 1988 fires, protection of lives and property continue to take precedence in all firefighting efforts.[60]"

The storm had a similar track and forward speed to that of the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane and is the first of five known major hurricanes to have struck the modern New England region.

This is likely because the hurricane evidently moved past rapidly, well east of the settlement. The pressure at this time is estimated to have been below 930 mbar (27.46 inHg).[1] This would make it the most intense tropical cyclone in the world north of modern-day South Carolina. The storm then continued at ~40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) before making landfall in eastern Long Island during the early morning of August 26, 1635, with sustained winds of at least 125\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h).[1][3] The storm then struck modern-day Connecticut and Rhode Island shortly after, with a pressure of 939\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg). Governors John Winthrop of Massachusetts Bay Colony and William Bradford of Plymouth Colony recorded accounts of the hurricane. Both describe high winds, 14 to 20 feet (4.3 to 6.1\u00a0m) storm surges along the south-facing coasts and great destruction.[1] The storm then continued before striking the Port of Boston with a pressure of ~945\u00a0mbar (27.9\u00a0inHg).

Locals noted the catastrophic damage to the environment, crops and structures.[4] Some damage was still noticeable over fifty years later. Bradford also wrote that the storm drowned seventeen Indians, flattened many houses and toppled or destroyed thousands of trees. The small barque Watch and Wait, owned by a Mr. Isaac Allerton, foundered in the storm off Cape Ann with twenty-three people aboard. The only survivors were Antony Thacher and his wife, who reached Thacher Island. Thacher wrote an account of the shipwreck, while John Greenleaf Whittier based his poem \"The Swan Song of Parson Avery\" on Thacher's account of Father Joseph Avery's death during the wreck. In Narragansett Bay, the tide was 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) above the ordinary tide and drowned eight Indians fleeing from their wigwams. The highest totals were at the head of Buzzards Bay, where a surge of 18 to 24 feet (5.5 to 7.3 m) occurred.[1] The town of Plymouth suffered severe damage when the town's houses blew down. The wind also blew down mile-long swathes of woods in Plymouth, and elsewhere in eastern Massachusetts. It also destroyed Plymouth Colony's Aptucxet Trading Post in Bourne. The worst of the damage in the greater Boston area occurred to the south. According to the accounts of Bradford and Winthrop, high surge swept over the low-lying tracts of Dorchester, ruining the farms and landscape. The ships James and Angel Gabriel had just anchored off the New England coast, full of settlers from England, and they were caught in the storm. James survived, but Angel Gabriel was wrecked at Pemaquid, Massachusetts Bay Colony (now Bristol, Maine).[5] An account from The Cogswells in America states: \"'The storm was frightful at Pemaquid, the wind blowing from the northeast, the tide rising to a very unusual height, in some places more than twenty feet right up and down; this was succeeded by another and unaccountable tidal wave still higher.' The Angel Gabriel became a total wreck, passengers, cattle, and goods were all cast upon the angry waves. Three or four passengers and one seaman perished, and there was the loss of cattle and much property.\"[6]"

The storm's eye would have struck Long Island before moving between Boston and Plymouth. The storm likely would have been a large Category 4 or 5 hurricane when passing by Virginia and was at least a high-end Category 3 at landfall. Sustained winds of 132\u00a0mph (212\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 938\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg) is the estimated intensity during the Long Island's landfall, & a pressure of 939\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg) during the second landfall.[1] If accurate, this would make it the most intense hurricane to make landfall north of Cape Fear, North Carolina. Jarvinen also noted that the hurricane may have produced the highest storm surge along the East Coast in recorded history, at great than 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) in the Narragansett Bay.[1] An erosional scarp in the western Gulf of Maine may be a trace of the Great Colonial Hurricane.[7]"

It was also the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 1994. Cyclone Geralda originated from an area of low pressure over the Indian Ocean on 25 January. Over the following few days, the depression underwent gradual intensification, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) on 31 January. It eventually made landfall near Toamasina, Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity, and substantially weakened within hours of moving onshore. By 5 February, Geralda had degenerated into a land depression, and became extratropical three days later. Geralda's remnants dissipated on 12 February. Geralda was the second cyclone in as many months to strike eastern Madagascar, after Daisy in January. Geralda produced wind gusts as strong as 350\u00a0km/h (220\u00a0mph), which were the highest worldwide for several decades. The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding, particularly in valleys. About 80% of the city of Toamasina was destroyed, including most schools, homes, and churches. The cyclone heavily damaged roads and rail lines, which later disrupted relief efforts. In the capital Antananarivo, Geralda killed 43\u00a0people after flooding many houses. Overall, more than 40,000\u00a0homes were destroyed, leaving 356,000\u00a0people homeless. Nationwide, the cyclone killed 231\u00a0people and caused over $10\u00a0million in damage (1994\u00a0USD).[nb 1] Relief work in the storm's aftermath was hampered by lack of coordination, and the Malagasy military were deployed to help storm victims. Few stocks were pre-positioned, causing food prices to rise greatly. Several countries and departments of the United Nations donated money or supplies to the country."

In response, MFR upgraded the system to a moderate tropical storm and named it Geralda. At that time, the storm was moving generally west-southwestward due to a ridge extending from Madagascar to the Mascarene Islands. High water temperatures fueled further development, first into a moderate tropical storm late on 28 January and then into a tropical cyclone 24\u00a0hours later.[1] By then, the JTWC had upgraded Geralda to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane.[3] Continuing generally to the west-southwest, Geralda intensified further, and MFR upgraded it to intense tropical cyclone status on 30 January. The cyclone developed a well-defined eye 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) in diameter and grew to a size of 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) in diameter.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on 31 January, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u2013minute sustained winds of 270\u00a0km/h (165\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale.[3] Six hours later, Geralda's appearance on satellite imagery warranted a Dvorak rating of 7.0. Based on this, MFR estimated a minimum barometric pressure of 905\u00a0mbar (26.7\u00a0inHg) and peak 10\u2013minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph),[1][5] just shy of very intense tropical cyclone status. At that time, gusts were estimated at over 300\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph). Geralda had intensified from a tropical disturbance to its peak intensity in only five days, which was described by MFR as \"an exceptional phenomenon\". Near peak intensity, the center of Geralda passed about 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) northwest of Tromelin Island, offshore eastern Madagascar.[1] After maintaining its peak winds for about 18\u00a0hours, Geralda weakened slightly while approaching eastern Madagascar. At 0600\u00a0UTC on 2 February, MFR estimated the winds were around 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[5] At about 1100\u00a0UTC that day, the cyclone made landfall just north of Toamasina as an intense tropical cyclone, where a pressure of 943\u00a0mbar (27.8\u00a0inHg) was reported.[1] Officials considered Geralda the strongest storm to hit the country since a cyclone in March 1927.[6] Geralda weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Madagascar, passing over the capital Antananarivo late on 2 February; both the JTWC and MFR had downgraded the cyclone to tropical depression status by the next day.[1][3] About 30\u00a0hours after its first landfall, Geralda briefly emerged into the Mozambique Channel late on 3 February. However, a trough soon turned it to the south, and Geralda crossed over western Madagascar, reaching open waters on 5 February.[1] By that time, the winds had decreased to 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph).[5] An approaching polar trough turned Geralda to the southeast on 6 February, and the cyclone became extratropical two days later. However, MFR continued tracking the remnants of Geralda until 12 February.[1]"

        "content": "Tromelin Island was the first landmass affected by Geralda. The island was just outside the eyewall, and experienced wind gusts of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[1] Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar just weeks after Tropical Cyclone Daisy affected the same general area. While Geralda was approaching the country, officials declared Emergency Phase 3 for Toamasina Province, indicating immediate danger, and Emergency Phase 1 for Antananarivo, which is a general alert.[6] As Geralda moved ashore, the cyclone produced wind gusts as strong as 350\u00a0km/h (220\u00a0mph), among the strongest gusts worldwide in several decades.[6] The storm also dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides and severe flooding, mostly in Toamasina Province. About 80% of the city of Toamasina was destroyed, including the country's only petroleum refinery at the time.[1] Damage to the refinery alone was estimated at $800,000.[7] An early estimate indicated that 95% of schools, homes, and churches sustained severe damage to complete destruction in the city, leaving 50,000\u00a0people homeless. In the harbor at Toamasina, Geralda sank seven ships, and throughout the city, power outages and road damage were commonplace.[6] Elsewhere in Madagascar, Geralda wrecked houses and bridges in F\u00e9n\u00e9rive. On \u00cele Sainte-Marie, all power lines and 90% of plantations were destroyed.[6] Brickaville, to the south of Toamasina, experienced severe flooding up to 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) deep. Lack of basic repairs before the storm contributed to roads and bridges being washed away there.[8] The cyclone killed 43\u00a0people when it flooded large portions of Antananarivo, leaving 60,000\u00a0people homeless.[6] High rainfall damaged houses in the city and cut off roads outside of the city. Damage was heavy in valleys where flash flooding occurred.[8] Across Madagascar, flooding wrecked over 300,000\u00a0ha (740,000 acres) of crop fields,[1] affecting 70% of the rice crop,[6] and killed more than 13,000\u00a0cattle. The combined impact of Geralda and earlier Cyclone Daisy damaged or destroyed more than 40,000\u00a0homes,[1] leaving at least 356,000\u00a0people homeless.[9] The storms also left severe damage to roads and rail systems. A total of 20\u00a0national roads and several secondary roads were disrupted. The rail line between Moramanga near the capital and Brickaville near the coast was damaged. Overall, Cyclone Geralda killed at least 231\u00a0people, with 73\u00a0missing as of MFR's annual cyclone report on the season; the storm also injured 267\u00a0people and caused over $10\u00a0million in damage (1994\u00a0USD).[1] In the aftermath, there was no pre-existing method of dealing with a storm of such magnitude, and most local governments failed to respond immediately due to lack of coordination. As a result, agencies spent much time in dealing with the logistics of the aftermath. There were few food supplies that were pre-positioned.[8]  The Malagasy government worked with the United Nations to create a committee, which met weekly and addressed various facets of the recovery.[8] Malagasy officials deployed members of the military to help storm victims, although damaged roads initially hampered relief efforts.[1] Due to crop damage, the price of rice increased by 300% in the country,[8] and there were food shortages in Antananarivo, along with fuel shortages elsewhere. In Toamasina, industrial activity was expected to take six months to resume production.[6] M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res helped assure the cleanliness of shelters in Antananarivo, while CARE delivered food to residents in Brickaville.[8] There were health issues related to the widespread flooding,[1] prompting the government to distribute medical supplies for 60,000\u00a0people.[6] Shortly after Geralda struck, the Malagasy government requested international assistance. The United Nations Department of Human Services provided an emergency $30,000 relief grant, and UNICEF later provided about $2.3\u00a0million in assistance. The European Union provided about $560,000 worth of medicine and relief. The French government sent $5\u00a0million worth of supplies via airplane from R\u00e9union, including food and medicine. Eight other countries sent assistance in the form of money or relief items.[6] By about two weeks after the storm's landfall, water and power service were being restored in Toamasina, although by that time, 40% of the communications network remained offline.[6] By 16 February, the road from Antananrivo and Toamasina had been reopened.[10] The Malagasy government imported oil for several months while its refinery was out of order. Non-government organizations provided rice to stabilize prices.[11] The damaged rail line between Antananarivo and the coast was rebuilt in 2003.[12] Schools that were repaired following Geralda were later successfully used as shelters.[8]"

It formed on 16 March and moved westward for the first ten days of its duration. Warm waters and low wind shear allowed for the storm to gradually strengthen. After developing a well-defined eye, Nadia intensified to reach winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph (10\u00a0minute sustained)) early on 22 March, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MF). In contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated winds of about 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph 1\u00a0minute sustained). On 23 March, the cyclone struck northern Madagascar, causing flooding and localized damage where it moved ashore. There were 12\u00a0deaths in the country. Nadia emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a weakened storm, although it reintensified slightly before making landfall in northeastern Mozambique on 24 March. The storm turned southward through the country, emerging over water on 26 March. It turned to the northeast and meandered over waters before dissipating on 1 April. Damage was heaviest in Mozambique, estimated at $20\u00a0million (1994\u00a0USD). Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. There, 85% of the houses were destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5\u00a0million people homeless. High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas without water, and significantly damaged crops, notably the cashew crop. The storm struck before the harvest, and lack of food resulted in 300\u00a0deaths in the months after the storm. Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240\u00a0deaths and injured thousands. Effects spread as far inland as Malawi."

        "content": "A disturbance in the Indian Ocean Intertropical Convergence Zone became evident southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on 16 March after two cyclones moved away from the region. Based on analysis from M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south.[1] On 17 March, the JTWC also began tracking the system.[2] Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on 19 March allowed for strengthening. That same day, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed.[1] A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.[3] After becoming a tropical storm, Nadia quickly intensified, developing a central dense overcast and later an eye. With minimal wind shear, the storm strengthened into a tropical cyclone early on 21 March.[1] That day, the JTWC estimated winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph 1-minute sustained), or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane,[2] and later that day, MF upgraded Nadia into an intense tropical cyclone.[1] While the cyclone was approaching northern Madagascar on 22 March, MF estimated that Nadia attained maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph (10\u00a0minute sustained)).[4] At around the same time, the JTWC estimated winds of about 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph (1-minute sustained)).[2] While at peak intensity, Nadia had well-defined outflow and an eye no larger than 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi). At about 0100\u00a0UTC on 23 March, Nadia made landfall on northern Madagascar near Vohemar, having weakened slightly from its peak.[1] While located over Madagascar, Nadia weakened into a tropical storm due to the mountainous terrain. With warm temperatures, the storm re-intensified slightly after entering the Mozambique Channel, and it passed about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) south of Mayotte at 1900\u00a0UTC on 23 March. At 1700\u00a0UTC the next day, Nadia made its second landfall on Mozambique, about halfway between Nacala and Mo\u00e7ambique.[1] Shortly thereafter, the JTWC discontinued advisories.[3] Despite moving further inland, Nadia retained a well-organized circulation and convection. The storm turned to the south and re-emerged into the Mozambique Channel late on 26 March near the mouth of the Zambezi River. Nadia gradually re-intensified while curving to the southeast, and it re-intensified into a tropical storm on 28 March,[1] the same day the JTWC resumed issuing advisories.[3] The storm strengthened to reach a secondary peak intensity of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph (10\u00a0minute sustained)), according to MF. After reaching a position about halfway between Mozambique and Madagascar, Nadia turned to the southwest on 1 April and lost its remaining convection.[1] The JTWC and MF discontinued advisories that day, and the circulation dissipated a day later.[1][3]"

The city of Nacala was heavily damaged,[1] with about 170,000\u00a0people losing their houses. Many residents evacuated Nacala, and temporary shelters were provided for those who stayed. At the port in Nacala, the local harbor was wrecked and two ships sank;[8] one of the damaged ships spilled oil into the Bay of Nacala.[10] The city lost power and water, and its primary hospital was destroyed. About 130\u00a0km (81\u00a0mi) of power lines were cut between Nampula and Nacala, and widespread road and bridge damage disrupted transportation. In the area along Nadia's path, over 120\u00a0schools were damaged destroyed, affecting over 46,864\u00a0students.[8] Across the country, roughly 1.5\u00a0million people were left homeless.[11] A World Food Programme building in the city was destroyed, wrecking 642\u00a0tonnes (708\u00a0tons) of stored food. Overall, Nadia killed 240\u00a0people in Mozambique and injured thousands.[8] Damage was estimated at $20\u00a0million (1994\u00a0USD).[12] Damage from Nadia extended as far inland as Malawi.[13]"

By April\u00a020, most primary roads were cleared, bridge reconstruction had commenced, and power was being restored. Heavy crop damage depleted food supplies,[8] The cyclone struck shortly before the annual harvest,[12] causing heavy crop damage that depleted food supplies.[8] Some residents who evacuated during the country's civil war returned late to assist in harvesting the remaining crops. In the six months after the storm, about 300\u00a0people died due to starvation.[12] Many secondary roads remained blocked in the weeks after the storm, forcing relief supplies to be transported by boat.[8] The country appealed to the international community for assistance, and by 6\u00a0May, various international agencies and governments donated about $1.4\u00a0million in cash (1994\u00a0USD). The French government sent $48,000 worth of medicine, blankets, and food, the United Kingdom sent $373,134 for generators, water tanks, and roofing materials, and the Spanish government sent about $117,000 worth of food and tents.

On 8 February, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone\u00a0\u2013 the equivalent of a hurricane\u00a0\u2013 on 9 February.[1] After becoming a tropical cyclone, Hollanda developed a small 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) eye as it tracked toward the island of Mauritius, located east of Madagascar. Continuing to intensify, the cyclone struck the northern coast of the island at 1800\u00a0UTC on 10 February at peak intensity,[1] with winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained winds) as assessed by MFR.[3] In addition, the cyclone produced gusts to 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[1] At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) (1\u00a0minute sustained winds).[2] While moving over Mauritius, the eye became disrupted, although Hollanda maintained much of its intensity as it passed just southeast of R\u00e9union early on 11 February. The cyclone remained well-defined as it moved more poleward, and an irregular eye remained visible on satellite imagery.

Officials also ordered for cars to be off the roads during the storm and for people to remain indoors. Forecasters initially expected the storm would remain slightly offshore.[5] Ultimately, Cyclone Hollanda made landfall at peak intensity, producing wind gusts of 216\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) in Mauritius's capital city of Port Louis.[1] Strong winds affected the northern and western portions of the island, particularly near the coast, and the cyclone was considered the worst to hit there since Cyclone Gervaise in 1975.[4] In addition to the winds, the storm dropped torrential rainfall that reached 711\u00a0mm (28.0\u00a0in) in Mare aux Vacoas.[1] Across the island, Hollanda destroyed 290\u00a0houses and severely damaged another 160, which left at least 1,500\u00a0people homeless.[4] Included among the damaged buildings was the Russian embassy, which faced such difficulties making repairs that the ambassadors moved their offices.[6] Damage to schools was estimated at 25\u00a0million rupees ($1.3\u00a0million 1994\u00a0USD),[7] causing some to be closed for as long as 12\u00a0days.[8] High winds downed 30% of the island's trees.[7] Many fell onto power lines,[4] which left 60% of Mauritians without power and about half without telephone service.[7] All external communications were cut to the country during the cyclone.[9] In addition, nearly half of the sugar plantations were destroyed,[4] although the primary industry of tourism was not significantly affected.[10] In total, the cyclone killed two people,[4] and left $135\u00a0million in damage (1994\u00a0USD);[11] the total included lost productivity, such as decreased sugar output.[7] Less than a week after Hollanda struck, Cyclone Ivy also hit Mauritius, although to a lesser extent than Hollanda. The combined impact caused most roads to be blocked by either fallen trees or mudslides; all main roads were quickly restored.[4] Following the storm's passage, the Mauritius government opened 130\u00a0shelters, and also provided 5,000\u00a0rupees to each homeless family.[4] The crop damage from Hollanda, in addition to a drought, decreased the following year's output by 22%.[12] In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant their crops.[4] Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm.[4] The country's prime minister issued an appeal to the European Union for 67\u00a0million rupees ($3.6\u00a0million 1994\u00a0USD) in assistance, although later dropped it to less than half that total.[13] The requested aid was for the restoration of phone and power utilities.[14] The storm's severe impact on Mauritius caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita,[15] and the overall GDP decreased by 10%.[16] Although the cyclone did not strike the island of R\u00e9union, Hollanda produced strong wind gusts that peaked at 234\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) in Sainte-Rose. Rainfall on the island peaked at 741\u00a0mm (29.2\u00a0in) at Grand Coude. The cyclone left damage to crops, power systems, telephones, and the water network, mostly due to the strong winds.[1]"

Developing on October 18 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the storm proceeded to strike eastern Jamaica and southeastern Cuba while overwhelming southwestern Haiti in a deluge of rain. The hurricane\u2014a Category 1 at its peak\u2014completed an unusual reversal of its path on October 23, heading southwestward toward Central America. Weakened by its interaction with Cuba, the storm soon regained strength and made its final landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios in Honduras on October 25. The cyclone weakened upon moving inland and dissipated two days later. Flooding and landslides in Jamaica took their toll on property, agricultural interests, and infrastructure; fruit growers on the island sustained about $2.5 million (1935 USD) in losses. Just off the coast, an unidentified vessel went down with her entire crew in the hostile conditions. Strong winds buffeted coastal sections of Cuba, notably in and around Santiago de Cuba. There, the hurricane demolished 100 homes and filled streets with debris. Only four people died in the country, thanks to the extensive pre-storm preparations. The storm did the most damage along the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti, where catastrophic river flooding took the lives of up to 2,000 individuals, razed hundreds of native houses, and destroyed crops and livestock. The heaviest destruction took place around the towns of Jacmel and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie; one early report estimated that 1,500 had been killed at the latter. Entire swaths of countryside were isolated for days, delaying both reconnaissance and relief efforts. The hurricane later created devastating floods in Central America, chiefly in Honduras. Reported at the time to be the worst flood in the nation's history, the disaster decimated banana plantations and population centers after rivers flowed up to 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) above normal. Torrents of floodwaters trapped hundreds of citizens in trees, on rooftops, and on remote high ground, requiring emergency rescue. The storm left thousands homeless and around 150 dead in the country, while monetary losses totaled $12 million. Flooding and strong winds reached into northeastern Nicaragua, though damage was much less widespread than in neighboring Honduras."

        "content": "The hurricane originated over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, where, on October 17, a broad and immature low pressure system was noted. The hurricane forecast center in Jacksonville, Florida issued its first advisory on the storm late on October 20, following ship reports of winds approaching and exceeding gale-force.[1] Contemporary reanalyses of the storm have determined that it organized into a tropical depression on October 18, then drifted toward the east, turning north-northeastward as it strengthened into a tropical storm early the next day.[2] Due to low environmental air pressures and the large size of the cyclone, intensification was gradual as the storm approached Jamaica, eventually making landfall on the eastern side of the island, just west of the Morant Point Lighthouse, at 13:00 UTC on October 21. The system came ashore with a central pressure of 995\u00a0hPa (29.4\u00a0inHg), suggesting maximum winds of 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[3] After emerging into the waters between Jamaica and Cuba, the storm slowed in forward speed, continued to intensify, and curved northwestward toward southeastern Cuba. The storm attained the equivalent of Category 1 hurricane status on the current-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale early on October 22, while meandering just off the coast of Cuba.[1][2] At around 18:00 UTC on October 22, the hurricane made landfall near Santiago de Cuba at its initial peak intensity, with winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[3] It started weakening early the next day after encountering the Sierra Maestra mountain range and moving southwestward, away from the coast. Steered by persistent high-pressure ridging over the eastern United States and western Atlantic, the cyclone would maintain this highly unusual path for the remainder of its duration in open waters.[1] It brushed Cuba's Cape Cruz and deteriorated to a tropical storm before passing relatively close to the western tip of Jamaica.[2][3] On the morning of October 24, the barometer aboard a ship in the storm's eye fell to 988\u00a0hPa (29.2\u00a0inHg), its lowest recorded pressure. The ship measured winds outside of the lull only up to 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h),[3] but the storm was reintensifying, and once again achieved hurricane strength later in the day.[2] It matched its previous peak intensity at 12:00 UTC on October 25 as it approached Cabo Gracias a Dios on the border of Honduras and Nicaragua.[3] Shortly thereafter, the hurricane crossed the Honduran coast for its final landfall.[2][3] The mountainous terrain of Central America worked to diminish the storm, which curved westward and steadily lost force, though observation of its decay was minimal.[1][3] The cyclone likely dissipated on October 27 over Guatemala.[2]"

Railways worked to secure non-essential trains, and residents of vulnerable coastal towns, including Caimanera, fled their homes in search of safer ground.[11][12] The hurricane subjected eastern parts of the island to intense gales, measured at over 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) at Santiago de Cuba before the anemometer failed.[1] The northern coast of the island around Nipe Bay also endured strong winds as high as 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h).[3] Winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) were recorded at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, though the effects there were generally light. Closer to the hurricane's center, in Santiago de Cuba, about 100 homes sustained complete structural failures.[11][13] The prolonged nature of the storm hampered search and rescue efforts amid the rubble.[14] Winds strew debris around the city,[11] blocking its streets.[6] A hospital and a power plant both suffered roof failure.[14] Electricity in Santiago de Cuba was preemptively turned off as conditions worsened,[12] contributing to regional power outages.[11] Significant flooding occurred after the Cauto River overflowed its banks,[14] making driving impossible.[13] The storm severed communications between towns in eastern Cuba after bringing down telephone and telegraph wires.[14] Apart from seven structures ruined in the Guant\u00e1namo area,[13] there was less destruction in many locations than initially feared.[9] There were reports of three fatalities in Caimanera, and one person died in Santiago de Cuba.[9] At least 29 individuals were treated for storm-related injuries.[11][13] Damage assessments in the immediate aftermath of the storm placed monetary damages in Cuba at $500,000.[13] In the aftermath, a public curfew was issued for Santiago de Cuba, forcing residents to remain indoors after 8 pm. To prevent looting, troops patrolled streets and vulnerable locations, such as banks.[11] Supplies of bread and milk ran short following the hurricane.[14] The greatest disaster occurred in southern Haiti, where as many as 2,000 people died,[1] possibly more.[15] The towns of Jacmel and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie\u2014both on the Tiburon Peninsula\u2014were devastated by catastrophic freshwater flooding after days of torrential rains. The entire peninsula, already remote in its own right, was isolated for a time, ensuring only scant detail of the disaster reached the outside world.[16] Information was initially relayed to the capital city of Port-au-Prince by a single aircraft.[17][18] Populations of valley villages were believed to have been wiped out as rains sent the streams from the channels, demolishing the frail, thatched huts of the natives. The Bismarck Tribune, October 28, 1935[19] The hurricane crippled infrastructure, blocking roads throughout the area and destroying a hydroelectricity plant in Jacmel. The town was left without power and drinking water.[16] In J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, the flooding was so severe as to sweep away a large metal bridge. Hundreds of poorly constructed native houses were destroyed on the Tiburon Peninsula, leaving thousands of survivors without homes.[19] Property damage in Haiti amounted to over $1 million.[17] Meanwhile, thousands of livestock were killed and crops were completely destroyed, prompting fears of impending famine.[16][17] Several days after the storm, the bodies of drowning victims had been recovered by the hundreds,[20] and it was suspected many of the deceased had been washed into the sea.[18] One preliminary estimate placed the number of dead in the J\u00e9r\u00e9mie area alone at 1,500,[20] suggesting the worst of the tragedy occurred there. Indeed, some modern sources have unofficially referred to the storm as Hurricane J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.[10] The Haitian government worked to bring emergency supplies and relief workers, at least partially by way of ship, to the flood-stricken region. As little was known about the extent of losses, officials rushed to restore communications with the disaster area.[17]"

Banana plantations suffered extensively,[1] causing the United Fruit Company about $6 million in losses. As in Haiti, the hardest hit areas of Honduras were cut off from the nation's capital of Tegucigalpa.[21] Severe river flooding wrought widespread destruction, especially around La Ceiba and throughout the Cort\u00e9s Department.[22] Many towns were inundated by up to 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) of water.[23] According to one source, the Ul\u00faa River \"officially\" rose some 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) from its normal height near Chamelec\u00f3n,[24] where the flood left 800 families homeless.[23] Many hundreds of individuals were stranded by raging flood waters in the Cort\u00e9s region, clutching to trees and rooftops as they awaited uncertain rescue.[25] Even after rescue boats brought many residents of Chamelec\u00f3n to safety, a third of the population remain trapped.[23] The rampant Cangrejal River reportedly obliterated an entire suburban community further east, near La Ceiba,[26] while the Agu\u00e1n River burst its banks at Trujillo and killed numerous plantation workers. By October 29, the bodies of 70 flood victims had been recovered at Corocito in Col\u00f3n.[27] Torrential rains extended into Tegucigalpa, causing urban flooding.[22] Just to the northeast, in San Juancito, a large landslide took the lives of at least three people.[24] Overall, the hurricane inflicted about $12 million in damage across Honduras (including the agricultural impacts),[21] resulted in about 150 deaths,[1] and destroyed the homes of thousands of residents.[23] The floods were considered to be among the worst in the country's history.[21][28] Almost immediately after the passage of the storm, a wide area of Honduras experienced strong earthquake activity.[29] Damaging, but less expansive, floods also occurred in parts of extreme northeastern Nicaragua around the Mosquito Coast.[1] The Coco River, which constitutes a large portion of the Honduras\u2013Nicaragua border, swelled 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) as observed about 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km) upstream of its mouth.[23] Banana farms were heavily damaged around Cabo Gracias a Dios, occupied by both nations, and according to early reports in that area, all but a handful of dwellings were destroyed. In spite of the flooding and hurricane-force winds, timely warnings prevented fatalities locally.[30][31]"

        "content": " Severe Tropical Storm Koni, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Gilas,[nb 1][1] caused moderate damage to areas of China and Vietnam in July\u00a02003. The eighth tropical storm in the western Pacific that year, Koni originated from a disturbance situated within the monsoon trough well east of the Philippines on July\u00a015. Tracking westward, intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July\u00a017. Upon moving into the South China Sea, however, conditions allowed for quicker strengthening, and as such the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July\u00a018 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.79\u00a0inHg),[nb 2] making it a severe tropical storm. However, atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as Koni made landfall on Hainan on July\u00a021, weakening the system. The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of Tonkin prior to a final landfall near Hanoi, Vietnam the following day. Tracking inland, the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused Koni to dissipate over Laos on July\u00a023. Shortly after development Koni tracked through the Philippines, killing two people. After moving into the South China Sea, turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines. Three of the plane's occupants received minor injuries. In Hainan, Koni caused heavy rainfall, peaking at 189\u00a0mm (7.4\u00a0in) at a station on Wuzhi Mountain. The rains resulted in the collapse of 1,400\u00a0homes and an estimated CN\u00a5140.27\u00a0million (US$16.9\u00a0million) in direct economic losses.[nb 3] Effects were worst in Vietnam, where three people were killed. Widespread power outages occurred, and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage, particularly in Vietnam's northern provinces."

        "content": "The precursor to Koni developed as an area of deep convection within an active monsoon trough well south of Guam on July\u00a012. Though atmospheric conditions were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the tropical disturbance failed to maintain consistent shower activity. Late on July\u00a014, however, the system developed organized rainbands.[1] This prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) to classify the system as a tropical depression at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a015, well north of Palau.[2] Shortly after, the storm entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\u00a0(PAGASA), immediately classifying the system as a tropical depression and designating it with the name Gilas; the JTWC later classified the system as such at 1200\u00a0UTC that day. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the depression westward for much of its initial stages.[3] On July\u00a016, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm strength,[1] while the JMA maintained the system's tropical depression classification.[2] Through July\u00a017, the tropical cyclone began to track across the central Philippines and concurrently entered hostile atmospheric conditions as wind shear and a suppressed outflow pattern began to impact the storm.[1] However, the cyclone was only a slightly weakened system by the time it emerged into the South China Sea the following day. At the same time, a shortwave trough began to force the storm northwestward towards China. At 0600\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018, the JMA upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, designating it with the name Koni.[2] Though conditions were more favorable over the South China Sea than over the Philippines, persistent, moderate wind shear prevented much strengthening.[1] However, a brief period of favorable conditions allowed for Koni to strengthen, and at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020 the tropical storm was upgraded to severe tropical storm status by the JMA.[2] Meanwhile, the JTWC upgraded the system to typhoon intensity six hours later.[3] Midday on July\u00a020 Koni began to develop a partial eye.[1] This indicated an increase in intensity, and as such Koni reached a peak in strength at 1800\u00a0UTC that day with maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.79\u00a0inHg). This intensity was maintained for roughly six hours, during which time Koni began to curve westward.[2] However, moderate wind shear conditions returned the following day, weakening the tropical cyclone.[1] At around 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a021, Koni made landfall on the southeastern coast of Hainan with winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph).[2] Land interaction further weakened Koni, and the restrengthening of the subtropical ridge to the cyclone's north resulted in a more westerly path.[3] After a brief reemergence into the Gulf of Tonkin, the system made another landfall, this time south of Hanoi, Vietnam at 0800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a022. At this landfall Koni was only estimated to have winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph). Upon tracking inland, the storm began to quickly weaken, and was downgraded to tropical depression intensity at 1800\u00a0UTC that day over northern Laos. Six hours later, the JMA declared Koni to have dissipated over the same general region.[2]"

        "content": "Four people were killed in the Philippines by Koni,[4] and an additional person was injured. Damage reports from the Philippines remained scarce,[1] though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250\u00a0million Philippine pesos (US$1.26\u00a0million).[5] On July\u00a018, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242\u00a0passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence, resulting in three minor injuries on board. The plane was later able to exit the area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport.[6] In Hong Kong, the nearby approach of Tropical Storm Koni forced the Hong Kong Observatory to issue the tropical cyclone warning signal No. 1, the signal of lowest urgency, for the special administrative region. Passing well south of Hong Kong, the strongest sustained wind associated with the storm in the region was an observation of 52\u00a0km/h (32\u00a0mph) winds in Tai Mo Shan. Ultimately effects in the Hong Kong area were limited to scattered squally weather producing isolated rainfall peaking at over 40\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) in some locations. In Hainan, where the storm made landfall, 35\u00a0flights were delayed while 28\u00a0others were cancelled due to conditions onset by Koni.[7] Ferry service across the Qiongzhou Strait was also halted, stranding 3,000\u00a0vehicles.[8] As a result of Koni, heavy rainfall took place across Hainan, peaking at 189\u00a0mm (7.4\u00a0in) at a station on Wuzhi Mountain. In the province alone, at least 1,400\u00a0homes collapsed. Direct economic losses stemming from Koni in Hainan were estimated at CN\u00a5140.27\u00a0million (US$16.9\u00a0million).[1] In order to counteract the flight suspensions and cancellations caused by Koni, 198\u00a0flights from Meilan Airport were scheduled after the storm's passage.[8] Vietnam was the country with the worst impacts from Koni. Widespread power outages and telecommunication failures were commonplace during the storm's passage. Offshore the northern coast of Vietnam, 19\u00a0fishing and passenger boats capsized due to strong waves produced by the tropical storm.[7][9] One of these sinkings near Do Son resulted in the death of a fisherman. Another person was killed in Tam Diep after being hit by a prostrated tree. Eighteen others in four of Vietnam's northern provinces were injured by flying debris kicked up by Koni's strong winds.[10] In Thanh H\u00f3a Province, strong winds uprooted trees and electricity poles. The roofs of 300\u00a0homes in Thanh H\u00f3a were torn apart. Koni also disrupted water supplies and telephone service in the city. Further north, in Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh, gusts reaching as high as 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) damaged 250\u00a0residences as well as 300 hectares (740 acres) of rice crops. Ten of the eighteen people injured country wide were injured there.[11] In Hanoi, the winds blew trees down.[10] Overall, 3\u00a0people were killed in Vietnam. Approximately 1,000\u00a0homes were destroyed by Koni, resulting in significant impacts to agriculture.[3] Despite significant impacts in Vietnam, rains brought by Koni alleviated persistent drought conditions over Vietnam's northern colonies.[11] Though the name Koni was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization, the name was corrected to Goni for its 2009 usage.[12] But later in 2020, the name Goni was retired after its usage due to the damage it caused."

        "content": "Hurricane Keith was an Atlantic hurricane in October 2000 that caused extensive damage in Central America, especially in Mexico and Belize. It was the fifteenth tropical cyclone, eleventh named storm, and seventh hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season. Keith developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on September\u00a028. The depression gradually strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Keith on the following day. As the storm tracked westward, it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September\u00a030. Shortly thereafter, Keith began to rapidly deepen, and peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane less than 24\u00a0hours later. Keith then began to meander erratically offshore of Belize, which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction. By late on October\u00a02, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker, Belize as a minimal hurricane. It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before another landfall occurred near Belize City early on the following day. While moving inland over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Keith weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October\u00a04. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day, and a hurricane on the following day. By late on October\u00a05, Keith made its third and final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico as a moderately strong Category 1 hurricane. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24\u00a0hours after landfall. Keith brought heavy rainfall to several countries in Central America, which resulted in extensive flooding, especially in Belize and Mexico. In Guatemala, the storm flooded 10 towns, and caused one fatality. Similarly, one fatality also occurred in El Salvador, and at least 300\u00a0people were affected by flooding in that country. Thirteen communities in Nicaragua were completely isolated after Keith made roads impassable. Twelve deaths were reported in Nicaragua, all of which were flood-related. Five people were presumed dead in Honduras after an aircraft disappeared near Roat\u00e1n; one other fatality occurred due to flooding. The storm brought torrential rainfall to Belize, with many areas reporting at least 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) of rain, while highest reported amount of precipitation was greater than 30 inches (760\u00a0mm). In Belize, a village reported that only 12\u00a0houses remained, while elsewhere in the country, at least 60 homes were destroyed or damaged; several houses in Belize City suffered minor roof damage. At least 19\u00a0people were killed in Belize and damages totaled to $280\u00a0million (2000\u00a0USD). Heavy rainfall also occurred in Mexico, especially in the states of Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas. Flooding from Keith caused several mudslides and a few rivers reached historic levels. Throughout Mexico, at least 460\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed and other losses in infrastructure occurred. In addition, one person drowned due to heavy rainfall. Damages incurred in associated with Keith in Mexico totaled to approximately $365.9\u00a0million (2000\u00a0MXN, $38.7\u00a0million 2000\u00a0USD). Overall, Keith was responsible for 68 deaths and $319 million (2000 USD) in damage.[1]"

        "content": "On September\u00a016, 2000 a tropical wave \u2013 an elongated area of low air pressure moving from east to west \u2013 exited the west coast of Africa. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development due to the presence of upper-level wind shear. After moving across the Caribbean Sea, a disturbance along the wave started to become better organized on September\u00a027.[2] The next day, a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated a closed circulation and winds of 37\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h); upon receiving the data, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Fifteen at 2100\u00a0UTC.[3] The NHC later estimated the depression had formed three hours earlier, about 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) north-northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios.[2] Upon forming, the depression had good outflow, although the convection was not as organized.[3] With an anticyclone over the system, the depression was expected to gradually intensify while moving slowly to the west-northwest, a motion caused by weak steering winds.[4] Late on September\u00a028, the NHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status and named it Keith,[2] after another Hurricane Hunters mission reported flight-level winds of 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h).[5] By the time Keith became a tropical storm, it was beginning to undergo rapid deepening,[2] fueled by warm waters, low wind shear, and an organizing cloud pattern.[5] There initially was uncertainty in the storm's future movement, due to a ridge in the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical cyclone prediction models differed on their assessments; three models anticipated a turn to the northeast toward Florida due to a trough, while others predicted a continued slow motion to the west-northwest, eventually reaching the Bay of Campeche.[6] After continued strengthening, Keith became a hurricane on September\u00a030, just 18\u00a0hours after becoming a tropical storm,[2] and making it the seventh such storm of that intensity of the season.[7] That day, an eye began developing as the structure became much better organized.[8] In a 13\u2011hour period beginning at 1808\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030, Keith underwent explosive deepening, as its barometric pressure dropped at a rate of nearly 3\u00a0mbar (0.089\u00a0inHg) per hour.[2] The NHC noted that Keith experienced conditions \"ideal for strengthening\", with the exception of the approaching land interaction with the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.[9] The hurricane slowed until stalling offshore eastern Belize, caused by the ridge to the north and the precursor to Tropical Storm Leslie forming over Cuba.[2] By early on October\u00a01, Keith had developed a well-defined eye about 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) in diameter, with what the NHC described as a \"spectacular appearance.\"[10] Later that day, Hurricane Hunters estimated a minimum pressure of 939\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg) and deployed a dropsonde that observed peak winds of 176\u00a0mph (283\u00a0km/h). Based on the data, the NHC estimated that Keith attained peak winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) at 0700\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01, while just offshore eastern Belize. This made it a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.[2] Shortly after Keith reached peak intensity, the eye had moved over portions of Belize, causing it to lose definition. Outflow became restricted, and the developing disturbance to the northeast increased wind shear. As a result, Keith began to weaken steadily on October\u00a01.[11] While remaining nearly stationary, Keith made a landfall on Ambergris Caye late on October\u00a02 as a minimal hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Keith weakened into a tropical storm,[2] and its convection became limited to the southeastern quadrant.[12] At 0300\u00a0UTC, the storm made its second landfall about 29\u00a0mi (47\u00a0km) north of Belize City, and within nine hours weakened into a tropical depression.[2] The building ridge to the north caused the system to accelerate more to the west-northwest across the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.[13] Early on October\u00a04, Keith emerged into the Bay of Campeche,[2] where favorable conditions allowed convection to quickly redevelop.[14] Later that day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm,[2] with improved outflow and convective organization.[15] On October\u00a05, the Hurricane Hunters reported a circular eye had reformed along with winds supporting an upgrade to hurricane status.[16] Keith intensified further that day, until it made its final landfall 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) north of Tampico with winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h).[2] It rapidly weakened over the high terrain of northeastern Mexico,[17] dissipating late on October\u00a06.[2]"

The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a warning, and a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the Belize coastline from Belize City to the Mexican border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest, and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the Belize coast with only about 24\u00a0hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula were dropped as Keith weakened.[2] On October\u00a02, the government of Belize declared a state of emergency and activated the entire Belize Defence Force due to the storm's threat.[18] The airport in Belize City was closed during Keith's passage, limiting transportation from the country's mainland to its offshore islands.[19] In Corozal, Belize, authorities evacuated the entire city of 10,000\u00a0people to numerous shelters in Orange Walk.[20] Officials were also ordered evacuations for Belize City, setting up shelters in Belmopan.[21] Overall, about 25,000\u00a0people evacuate, or about 10% of Belize's population.[22] Three hospitals were evacuated in the country.[23] In a post-storm assessment, residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were unprepared for the storm and did not anticipate such intensity.[24] In Quintana Roo, 5,000\u00a0people from Chetumal and surrounding low-lying areas were forced to evacuate to 30\u00a0shelters.[25][26] Offshore along a coral reef, about 50\u00a0fishermen stayed on a coral reef during the storm.[25] In the Bay of Campeche, Pemex evacuated about 6,300\u00a0workers from its offshore oil platforms.[27] Officials in Yucat\u00e1n and Veracruz declared states of emergency.[18] When Keith reached the Gulf of Mexico and began re-intensifying, a hurricane warning was issued from Tuxpan to Matamoros in northeastern Mexico, with a tropical storm watch issued northward to Port Mansfield, Texas.[2] About 3,000\u00a0residents in Tamaulipas evacuated to 250\u00a0shelters, and in neighboring Veracruz, about 175\u00a0people left their houses before the storm struck. The threat of Hurricane Keith caused Mexican authorities to close most ports along the gulf coast,[28] and many schools in the area were closed.[29]"

There were reports of people walking onto the temporarily dry bay floor, despite the potential for the waters to return in the event of shifting winds. At Caye Caulker, the hurricane produced a 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) storm surge from the west. Winds were unofficially estimated to have reached 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) in the offshore islands of Belize. Wind gusts on the mainland reached 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h) at Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport. Due to its slow motion, Keith dropped heavy rainfall, amounting to over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) in many parts of the country. The highest recorded precipitation total was 32.67 inches (830\u00a0mm) at the international airport in Belize City.[2] The strong winds destroyed 130\u00a0houses in Belize.[22] Two hotel roofs were wrecked, and the winds knocked down trees and power lines. Widespread areas of Belize lost power and telephone service, including Belize City. There, the heavy rainfall flooded streets,[26] reaching 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) deep.[33] Twenty homes were damaged to some degree in the capital, while many more suffered minor roof damage.[20] The rains flooded the first floor of the primary hospital in the city,[34] causing severe damage.[35] Nationwide, 11\u00a0health facilities were damaged.[36]  Elsewhere in the country, the rains increased levels along rivers,[18] including the Belize River, Rio Hondo, and New River.[37] The Belize River rose for several days after the storm,[38] reaching record levels of 21\u00a0ft (6.6\u00a0m) in width,[37] which isolated 15\u00a0villages.[39] Flooding covered Northern Highway and Western Highway as well as the primary bridge from Belmopan to the rest of Cayo District.[40] Residual floodwaters persisted due to the low-lying land of the country and poor drainage.[41] Floods contaminated water supply in the northern four districts,[42] causing an E. coli outbreak and food poisoning.[43] In Belize, Corozal, and Orange Walk districts, about 30% of the houses were severely damaged by flooding.[42] Damage was heaviest in the northern offshore islands and in the northern portion of the mainland.[44] On the offshore islands, downed trees and power lines blocked most roads.[42] In Caye Caulker and San Pedro, Keith damaged the roofs of about 90% of houses and damaged or destroyed 676\u00a0houses,[28] leaving 3,279\u00a0people homeless.[42] About 50% of the houses in Caye Caulker were destroyed,[35][45] In San Pedro, about 30% of houses,[35] or at least 50, were wrecked.[45] On Ambergris Caye, four airplanes were destroyed.[42] At Turneffe Atoll, about 35% of the landmass was affected, with many trees in that section uprooted and numerous tree branches snapped.[46] Five individuals died in maritime accidents involving at least one catamaran.[2] There was an accident involving a bus carrying evacuees, killing four people on board.[35] Three people died on the offshore Ambergris Caye.[47] Overall, 19\u00a0people perished in the country.[30] Several injuries, mainly from flying debris, were reported in San Pedro,[1] and there were 142\u00a0people who were injured in the storm.[42] Throughout the country, approximately 3,279\u00a0homes were either damaged or destroyed.[47] The damage total from Keith was initially estimated at $200\u00a0million, about half of which was to tourism facilities; the remainder was roughly split between crop and infrastructure damage.[48] About 75% of the crops in the country were damaged, including much of the corn harvest that was expected to begin in October.[47] The damage total was later estimated at $280\u00a0million,[1] most of it on the offshore Ambergris Cay and Caye Caulker.[2]"

In Quintana Roo, Keith left $2.7\u00a0million (2000\u00a0MXN, $294,000 2000\u00a0USD) in damage, and caused an additional $39.7\u00a0million (2000\u00a0MXN, $4.2\u00a0million 2000\u00a0USD) in indirect costs.[32] While crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Keith dropped heavy rainfall, including over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) in Campeche state.[49] Chetumal, Quintana Roo reported 9.65\u00a0in (245\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[2] When Keith made its final landfall, Tampico reported tropical storm force winds, with gusts to 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h).[2] The winds damaged billboards and some trees in the city, and elsewhere along the coast, Keith knocked down trees and power lines.[28] About 200,000\u00a0people in northeastern Mexico lost power, and 100,000\u00a0people were left without water.[50] About 400\u00a0houses were damaged in Veracruz, and many roads and bridges were destroyed.[51] Heavy rainfall occurred in the interior of northeastern Mexico, peaking at 24.55\u00a0in (624\u00a0mm) in Gonz\u00e1lez, Tamaulipas.[2] In a reporting station in the municipality of G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, the pluviometer reported a 24-hour rain total of 13.24 inches (336\u00a0mm), and a storm total of 18.44 inches (468\u00a0mm), which broke the precipitation record for that location, which counted with 35\u00a0years of data.[32] This rain also caused rivers to reach record levels, as the Sabinas River rose 10.95\u00a0m (35.9\u00a0ft) on October 6, to a new historical peak, and the Guayalejo River rose 77.46\u00a0ft (23.61\u00a0m), slightly under the 1976 record. This rainfall caused the Las \u00c1nimas dam to catch 525,000 acre-feet (648,000,000\u00a0m3) of water between October 5 and October 17; however, some of this water had to be released, as the upstream face of the dam was damaged by debris, and had to be repaired. Overall, the storm produced $117.8\u00a0million in damage (2000 MXN, $12.4\u00a0million 2000\u00a0USD) in the state.[32] In Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the remnants of Keith interacted with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall,[49] reaching 14.43\u00a0in (367\u00a0mm) in Sabinas.[2] The average precipitation in the state was 5 inches (130\u00a0mm), and the deluge caused causing mudslides in several cities, including San Pedro, Guadalupe and Escobedo. High rainfall also caused flash flood in mountainous areas near Monterrey, forming swift river currents that rose up to 9,000\u00a0ft\u00b3/s (250\u00a0m\u00b3/s), and dragged 130\u00a0people into local rivers; however, all were rescued. The rivers also dragged 30 vehicles, all of which were moderate to total losses. The storm runoff caused the El Cuchillo dam to receive 105,000 acre-feet (130,000,000\u00a0m3) of water daily, and the La Boca dam to receive 810 acre-feet (1,000,000\u00a0m3) per hour. About 13,000\u00a0residents lost power. About 5,000\u00a0people were forced evacuated from several municipalities in the state, including 2,465 from Monterrey and 1,900 from rural areas, at a cost of $400,000 (2000 MXN).[32] The total damages in the state rose to $115.6\u00a0million (2000 MXN, US$12.2\u00a0million in year 2000), with the damage to urban infrastructure being the most expensive portion of the damage, with $44.2\u00a0million (2000 MXN, US$4.6\u00a0million in 2000) used to repair damage in eight municipalities; in particular, San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda received approximately three quarters of the infrastructure damage, with $30.8\u00a0million (2000 MXN, $3.3\u00a0million 2000\u00a0USD). Additionally, about 460\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed, and 300\u00a0families had to be relocated to safer areas.[32] In other states, damage was lighter, but still significant. In Sonora, total damages rose to $64.4\u00a0million (2000 MXN, $6.8\u00a0million 2000\u00a0USD); in Chiapas, $25.6\u00a0million (2000 MXN, $2.7\u00a0million 2000\u00a0USD) of property damage were caused by the storm. This brings up the total damage in Mexico to $365.9\u00a0million (2000 MXN, $38.7\u00a0million 2000\u00a0USD).[32] In Tabasco, flooding damaged 7,896\u00a0houses.[51] Approximately 24,000\u00a0residents in the state were impacted by flooding. At the capital city of Villahermosa, large rivers in the area overflowed, flooding some streets. However, dikes and sandbags along the banks of the rivers prevented further flooding.[52] Overall, about 46,000\u00a0people had to evacuate Mexico due to the storm and its flooding.[29] There was one fatality when a man in Tampico was electrocuted by a downed power line.[28] In Xicot\u00e9ncatl, Tamaulipas, a swollen river killed a family of six when their house was flooded.[53] Overall, Keith killed 23\u00a0people in Mexico \u2013 13 in Veracruz, 4 in Puebla, and 6 in Tamaulipas. There were six indirect deaths when a plane crashed while attempting to land in Reynosa, Tamaulipas.[31]"

One person died when a wall collapsed,[59] and there were five other fatalities an aircraft disappeared near Roatan Island.[2] A bridge along the Pan-American Highway between Honduras and Nicaragua was destroyed, which had been rebuilt following Hurricane Mitch.[58] Additionally, a government agency reported that as many as 80,000\u00a0people in southern Honduras were left isolated.[52] In Nicaragua, floods from the storm forced 3,962\u00a0people to evacuate their houses to 57\u00a0shelters,[60] many of which were schools.[61] Floods affected 11 of the 17\u00a0Departments of Nicaragua, which began receding on October\u00a05 as Keith exited the region. The floods caused several landslides and covered roads, which isolated communities.[62] Keith damaged 436\u00a0houses in the country and destroyed another 160.[38] There were 12\u00a0fatalities due to the storm in Nicaragua,[2] one of whom a boy who was swept away by a fast moving flooded river northeast of Managua,[57] while another death occurred after a man drowned in Lake Managua. A man in the western portions of the country died after stepping on a power lines, which had fallen due to strong winds. Fifty communities were isolated, with at least thirteen of them due to impassable roads.[36] Several neighborhoods in Corinto flooded, forcing the Civil Defense to evacuate 9\u00a0families. One house collapsed in Los \u00c1ngeles, though its ten occupants escaped without injury. After rainfall lashed in Villanueva, Chinandega, for six days, the resultant flooding forced 300\u00a0families evacuated, while there was significant losses the corn, beans and plantains crops. An additional 20\u00a0families left their homes due to flooding in Poneloya. About 15\u00a0families in the port city of Puerto Sandino were evacuated after the El Contrabando river overflowed. Another 18\u00a0homes were flooded in the region of Salinas Grandes. About 52\u00a0fled Troilo after at least 11\u00a0homes flooded.[63]"

United Nations Children's Fund also gave out $150,000 for relief in areas not focused on by other relief groups.[64] The Peace Corps, the Red Cross, and the United States Navy black hawk helicopters worked together to deliver rice, corn, sugar, salt, cooking oil, toilet paper, and medications to about 700\u00a0families in Bermuda Landings and adjacent isolated villages. The American Red Cross donated about $28,500 and 4,080\u00a0family hygiene kits.[47] Between October and November 2000, the National Society distributed 5,289\u00a0food and hygiene parcels to 26,293\u00a0people in Belize City, Orange Walk, and Belmopan. Around that time, the Belize Red Cross Society (BRCS) distributed relief items to 4,622\u00a0victims in Belize City. The BRCS also shipped  two containers with kitchen sets and water buckets for 1,600\u00a0families, donated by the German Red Cross.[65] A donation account to help the relief effort, titled Hurricane Keith Relief Fund, was set up by the town of Placencia, in the local Atlantic Bank. The Belize Consulate in California also set up a donation fundraiser. Placencia also delivered a boat full of donated food, clothing, and building supplies to the San Pedro and Caye Caulker area.[66] In the immediate aftermath, officials enacted a curfew for Belize City, Caye Caulker and San Pedro to curtail looting, and the latter two areas were declared disaster areas. The entirety of the northern three districts (out of six total) were also declared disaster areas.[40] There were initial difficulties in determining the needs in the affected residents, due to cut communications.[45] The government sent planes with emergency supplies to the most affected offshore islands.[67] Several emergency teams were sent to Caye Caulker and San Pedro as soon as weather conditions permitted it. Widespread road repairs also began almost immediately after Keith's occurrence. The Belize International Airport was back online by the morning of October 4, only a single day after the tropical cyclone passed through the area.[66] By that time, boat service was re-instated with the most affected areas to pick up stranded tourists.[67] Workers quickly restored power and water in Belize City.[43] In the days after the storm struck, residual flooding sparked fears for the spread of disease.[35] In Orange Walk and Cayo District, residents were advised to stay indoors to avoid bites from poisonous snakes.[45] In Nicaragua, the United States ambassador declared a disaster, which prompted various United Nations departments to provide $25,000 to the country.[61] Due to the hurricane's high impact, the name Keith was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2001 and it will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone.[68] The name was replaced with Kirk for the 2006 season.[69][70]"

These predominantly pastoral regions reported deaths of up to half of the livestock.[3] Droughts in Kenya have become more frequent causing crop failures and devastation as three-quarters of the population are sustained by agriculture.[4]"

        "header": "Background",
        "content": "Owing to the lack of annual rainfall, the arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya (ASALs) are very susceptible to drought and flooding. These lands are impacted by the increasing effects of climate change and the risk of desertification. Water scarcity leaves unimproved water supplies for the majority of the population, so these places tend to be marginalized, and have high rates of poverty.[5] Kenya experienced limited rainfall in 2008 from October to December, followed by a similar situation in 2009. The Kenyan Red Cross conducted assessment reports indicating the risk of starvation for millions of Kenyans, resulting in an appeal to the international donor community for food aid.[6] Kenya has been supported by a drought management system since 1980. The system includes policies and strategies, an early warning system, a funded contingency plan, and overall drought coordination and response structure.[7] Despite that, at the end of the 2008\u20132009 drought, the European Union delegation considered that a review of the responses to this drought would have been appropriate, in order to strengthen the efficiency of the drought management and alleviate its consequences. The system became the responsibility of the National Drought Management Authority, established in 2011.[3]"

This provoked a climate of violence in the East of the country which drove away farmers who were unable to return in time to plant maize in the planting season.  This led to food, water, and power shortages throughout the country.[4] In 2011 the USAID youth program, which works closely with Feed the Future, brought groups of young mothers together to improve food security, working on nutrition. Cultivating vegetables and legumes they have been improving their health and that of their infants, in a shared urban farm in Mombasa. Making sure that children are well-fed is eminent as malnutrition in childhood and pregnancy has many adverse consequences for child survival and long-term well-being. Food-borne illnesses are often caused by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that affect human health.  Food security issues were also created by violations in trade standards, resulting in the exclusion of food from international, regional, and local markets.[8]"

        "header": "Effects on the Maasai pastoralists",
        "content": "In Kenya, pastoralism represents a mainstay source of sustenance, providing livelihood, security, and employment opportunities (around 90% of the population). It is impacted by droughts, that directly impact livestock assets of pastoral households.[citation needed] Maasai pastoralists are traditionally semi-nomad and practice seasonal transhumance from dry to wet season pastures. The severe drought of 2009 has prompted pastoralists in Northern Kenya to abandon their traditional lifestyles (like in the 2005 drought) due to the harsh living conditions and the destruction of their pastures by drought, overgrazing, and soil erosion. In conditions of extreme drought, some pastoralists tried to dig down into dry riverbeds and water pans looking for water[citation needed] and others moved onto highland pastures in Mt. Kenya.  These responses were eventually unsuccessful due to the increasing number of livestock deaths (it is estimated that over 38,000 cattle died).[citation needed] The high number of losses also constituted a social implication for the Maasai, who as a tradition measure their wealth on the dimension of their herds.[9]\nDue to the high mortality rate at the time, there was a major decline in livestock.  This raised the prices of milk and other livestock items, which adversely affected hunger levels and lowered income levels. Land degradation also increased due to livestock competition from pastures and water.[10] To cope with the drought in the short term the Maasai developed four strategies. The first was to take their animals to graze very early in the morning when the grass is covered with dew. The second was to guard reserve pastures on their higher lands while the grass regenerated so that it can be used during drought. The third strategy was to increase the length of their migrations as the gravity of the drought worsened. The last method was to dig shallow wells in dry riverbeds during migrations to acquire water.[citation needed] Two long-term solutions were developed. The first was to keep livestock of mixed-species; in addition to the traditional herd composed by grazers (cattle and sheep) and browsers (goats), pastoralists added donkeys and camels. Different animal species adapt differently to drought and this method ensured that at least part of the herd survived in a specific climatic event.[citation needed] The second method was to increase the size of their herds during wetter periods, so they have some animals left at the end of a drought period.[9]"

        "header": "Micro-climate",
        "content": "Climate change has been playing an important role in Kenya's droughts, reducing the drought cycle from every ten years to annual events. When the cycle of droughts in Kenya occurred every ten years, farmers had recovery time to rebuild their livestock and crops before the next drought.[6] When the recovery time dropped to two years, this recovery was no longer possible.[11] Dryness is not the only outcome of climate change: rains have decreased during the long rainy season (from March to May), but have registered an increase from September to February causing an extension of the normal rainfall period (October to December), which, together with growing intensity and strength, has created vulnerability to floods.[12] The table below displays data of the average monthly rainfall of Kenya from 1901 to 2016, compared with the predicted changes for 2080\u20132099.[13] It is expected that the annual average temperature of the territory of Kenya will increase by 1.0\u00a0\u00b0C to 2.8\u00a0\u00b0C by 2060,[13] with greater effects in the tea production, but a negative impact on crop and maize revenues.[14] Data showing the actual and predicted mean annual temperature increase is shown for the period 1901 to 2099: The Rift Valley Province is particularly sensitive to climate change. It is predicted that coastal areas will suffer from rising sea levels from which floods and saltwater intrusions will result, due to the melting of glaciers which will further reduce the availability of water.[15]"

By September 2009, at least 60 elephants and hundreds of animals had died in the country.[9] There was a conflict between locals and wildlife due to the absence of land. Consequently, the pastoralists took their herds illegally into the national parks and wildlife reserves, in a search for grazing land and water. The pastoralists felt betrayed by their government because they thought that the interests of the tourists who come to see the wildlife had been put before their own. They questioned why they had to allow wildlife on to their land but could not legally use the parks and reserves for grazing at such difficult times.[9]"

The annual growth rate fell to 1.5 per cent because of the drought. Despite the growth they worked for in the construction sector, tourism and agriculture faced very high declines (-36 and -5 per cent, respectively), and inflation rose to an unprecedented annual rate of 26.2 per cent.[10] In 2009, the government designed certain steps to promote growth in order to increase the GDP. These initiatives included restoration of investor confidence, an expansionary fiscal policy through a stimulus package, and monetary policy focus to preserve price stability at a single-digit rate. They were able to make the GDP rise by 2.6% with this method. The agriculture sector contracted by 2.7% due to the drought, high costs of inputs, and depressed demand for some of the country's exports due to the global financial crisis.[10] In 2011, the GDP reached 10.06% due to the strong performance of the financial sector, construction and tourism. The population was also facing a high annual rate of inflation caused by rising food and fuel prices, which appeared to affect the poor disproportionately. The combination of four factors was also threatening the Kenyan economy: high fuel prices, high food prices, the drought in the Horn of Africa, and the Euro crisis.[10]"

This is likely to be an underestimation because cost information for two-thirds of the projects funded by these donors were not available.

Clean water tanks were distributed to the communities, who used it to cook their food, removing the need to walk 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) to fetch water (6:00 to 15:00 every day). The farm animals had access to water, but the impact was minimal as most died anyway. There were two limits of the intervention. Firstly, the water supplied was not enough for all the inhabitants. Only those who lived near the roads could be helped, because the arid terrain made moving to the inner villages too risky. Secondly, whoever managed to acquire the water could only use it for cooking and drinking, because there was not enough to be used for chores such as washing clothes or bathing. They mostly targeted women and schools for water support, rather than the adult male population, therefore the community estimated only about 10 per cent of the population benefited. In Merti, Isiolo, the community also felt that the use of a Bowser (tanker) helped the people that were left in the villages, whilst the animal breeders were forced to migrate with their animals, looking for other natural sources.[3]"

After June, 63% of all measures were introduced, 77% related to animal feeding, 70% to borehole development/maintenance, and 54% for peace-building. The Kenyan government began carry out de-stocking operations in May 2009. Effective contributions made from NGOs started later in the year, from July 2009. ALRMP, which began to contribute to interventions by the Kenyan government,[3] was the only exception to this latency of action by the key members. \n49% of the total expenditure on livestock-related drought intervention between 2008 and 2009 was accounted for by conventional livestock interventions, which mainly included feed, health, and de-stocking.

The main determinants which established the level of effectiveness of an intervention  were whether the intervention was completed as planned and if they were able to deliver the intended benefits to the targeted beneficiaries.[19] Contributions from NGOs were generally considered more effective than those completed by the Kenyan government. Specifically, the contributions that made most of the difference and therefore top-ranked in the highest average effectiveness ratings, were funded by international donors.\nIt was not possible to determine a relationship between the effectiveness of an intervention and the time at which it started.[19] On average, an intervention reached 3,227 individuals, increasing from 55 for peace-building to 22,370 for water trucking. The cost per individual reached was KSh.\u00a03,362/= (approximately US$30.60 in 2021).  This ranged from 163/= for water trucking to 8,652/= for emergency replenishment. This indicates that a total of more than 1.5 million people benefited, based on the presumption of no duplication (if the same person is benefiting from multiple interventions).[19]\nThe real relative impact that each intervention has had on the population is difficult to assess even though there is evidence to determine a better efficacy of one intervention. The reason is that there is inadequate information on the scale of the benefits given to individuals and households.\nIn general, there was no relationship between an intervention's efficacy and the capital invested in its success.[19]"

        "content": " The 1932 San Cipri\u00e1n hurricane[a] was one of the strongest tropical cyclones in the history of Puerto Rico. The center of the storm traversed the island on an east-to-west path in late September\u00a01932, killing 272\u00a0people and inflicting at least $35\u00a0million in damage.[b] Winds in San Juan, Puerto Rico, were estimated to have reached at least 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h), causing extensive destruction. The storm's origins can be traced back to at least September\u00a025, 1932, when it was a tropical storm east of the Windward Islands. Moving west as a compact tropical cyclone, it rapidly intensified as it moved across the Virgin Islands the following day before ultimately making landfall on September\u00a027 in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, at a peak intensity equivalent to that of a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The hurricane diminished for the remainder of its duration, leaving Puerto Rico and brushing the southern coast of Hispaniola. The cyclone passed near Jamaica on September\u00a029 and moved ashore British Honduras on October\u00a01 as a tropical storm, dissipating the next day over southeastern Mexico. The hurricane brought strong winds to parts of the Virgin Islands. In Saint Thomas, wires and trees were blown down and homes were damaged. Ships also sank in the Saint Thomas harbor, as well as at Tortola. Property losses on Saint Thomas were estimated to have exceeded $200,000 and 15\u00a0people were killed. Most of the damage caused by the San Cipri\u00e1n hurricane occurred in Puerto Rico, particularly along the island's northern half. The powerful winds caused the destruction of numerous buildings. Over 40,000\u00a0homes were destroyed throughout the U.S. territory, contributing to a $15.6\u00a0million property damage toll and rendering 25,000\u00a0families homeless. Heavy losses were wrought upon crops, particularly to citrus and coffee. The hurricane killed 257\u00a0people in Puerto Rico and injured another 4,820. Economic losses stemming from the devastation were equivalent to 20\u00a0percent of Puerto Rico's gross income."

        "content": "The presence of unusually high air pressures throughout the Atlantic and eastern North America caused the 1932 San Cipri\u00e1n hurricane to take an atypical path directed towards the west and west-southwest over its duration.[6] Details about the hurricane's genesis are unclear due to a lack of contemporaneous weather observations. In 2012, the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) investigated the storm's history,[c] determining that the hurricane's progenitor had developed into a tropical storm with sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a025, 1932.[8] At that point, the storm was amid a period of intensification and centered approximately 340\u00a0mi (550\u00a0km) east of Antigua. Its winds increased as it moved west, reaching hurricane-force by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a025.[10] Early the next day, the hurricane passed near Antigua and Saint Barthelemy, and later between Saint Thomas and Saint Croix, tracking west-northwest at roughly 10\u00a0mph (16\u00a0km/h).[6] Around 13:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026, the center of the storm passed near Saba with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h);[d] the steep pressure gradient measured on that island was indicative of a small and rapidly intensifying hurricane.[8] At around 04:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a027, the compact hurricane made landfall on Puerto Rico near Ensenada Honda in the municipality of Ceiba. Upon moving ashore, the hurricane had sustained winds estimated at 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h)[d] and a minimum central pressure of 943\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.85\u00a0inHg), equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The region of hurricane-force winds was likely no larger than 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) in diameter upon landfall, with a radius of maximum winds likely smaller than 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km). The storm's center tracked over Puerto Rico for seven hours on an east-to-west course before emerging into the Caribbean Sea off Aguadilla.[8] Land interaction with Puerto Rico caused the storm's maximum winds to decrease to 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h);[d] the hurricane maintained this strength until it struck the southern ends of the Dominican Republic and Haiti on September\u00a028.[6][8][10] This second landfall weakened the system significantly, reducing the winds to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[d][8] The storm took a slightly south of west heading for the rest of its duration, passing near Jamaica on September\u00a029.[10] According to the AOML, the storm might have weakened to a tropical depression between September\u00a029\u201330 while traversing the western Caribbean.[8] The tropical storm reorganized slightly upon making its final landfall south of Belize City in British Honduras at around 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01 with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[d] It progressed west-southwest into southeastern Mexico, weakening before dissipating on October\u00a02.[8]"

Despite the center of the hurricane passing between the islands, neither island experienced hurricane-force winds, their speeds only reaching 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[8][6] The United States Weather Bureau characterized the damage on Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint John, Saint Thomas, and Tortola as \"moderate\".[6] Legislative elections in the Virgin Islands were postponed due to the inclement conditions. Two passenger-filled sloops in Tortola were lost.[13] Estimated winds of 60\u201390\u00a0mph (97\u2013145\u00a0km/h) swept across Saint Barthelemy.[6] Radio antennas were blown down by the winds in Saba.[6] The firing of warning guns on Saint Thomas 90\u00a0minutes before the storm's arrival allowed the island's populace to seek shelter. Many houses were damaged and wires and trees were blown down on the island. Small ships capsized in the Saint Thomas harbor. Fifteen people were killed and total property losses on the island were estimated to exceed $200,000.[14][15] The destruction of huts and crops rendered hundreds of people destitute. The Red Cross and the Saint Thomas government allocated $6,000\u00a0total to relief efforts.[16]"

        "content": "The Weather Bureau office in San Juan was first made aware of the storm's presence on September\u00a026, following a report of the passage of a \"moderate disturbance\" near Antigua.[6]  Its first storm bulletin was issued that evening after the center of the storm passed between Saint Thomas and Saint Croix, noting the rapidity of the storm's movement and its small size.[6][17] This and subsequent bulletins were disseminated in Puerto Rico by the territorial government, the U.S. Navy, and local radio station WKAQ. The San Juan Weather Bureau office lauded these bodies in their report on the storm published in the Monthly Weather Review, writing that \"the loss of life and property damaged were materially reduced\" due to their efforts.[6] There were 18\u00a0hours of advance warning for San Juan before the hurricane struck.[18] The bureau continued to issue advisories concerning the storm twice daily through October\u00a01.[6] At the beginning of the 1932 Atlantic hurricane season, the Governor of Puerto Rico, James R. Beverly, directed mayors in the territory to organize municipal emergency committees, requiring each to hoist hurricane flag signals at the cathedrals and city halls of every town whenever a hurricane warning was in effect. Mayors and police forces in Puerto were advised by the Weather Bureau's first statements on the storm to begin safeguarding lives and property. A meeting was held on the afternoon of September\u00a026 between the governor, heads of executive departments, the manager of the Puerto Rican chapter of the American Red Cross, and other prominent citizens to formulate plans of actions for possible emergencies arising from the hurricane's passage; these included the mobilization of crews to repair communications infrastructure and police-assisted evacuation of vulnerable people into the sturdiest buildings.[4] The American Red Cross in the continental U.S. also prepared to send aid to Puerto Rico when necessary.[19] Forty-nine municipalities of Puerto Rico were affected by the storm to varying degrees, with devastation wrought across the northern half of the territory.[4] The hurricane's effects killed 257\u00a0people;[4] most of these fatalities were due to the collapse of buildings, with wind-blown debris and drownings also responsible for some deaths.[6] Over 4,820\u00a0others were injured.[4] Though people took shelter in buildings thought to be safe, only well-built masonry and concrete structures withstood the storm in the hardest-hit areas. Concrete buildings made of concrete with a water-to-cement ratio and improperly or poorly anchored roofs were destroyed, killing many. Homes with corrugated iron sheet roofs attached using smooth or twisted nails, common in San Juan, were unroofed.[6] In total, 45,554\u00a0houses were razed and another 47,876\u00a0were partially destroyed.[4] The severity of the damage was equivalent to that of an F3\u00a0tornado on the Fujita scale.[8] Writing to the United States Secretary of War in 1933, Beverly described the damage was more severe than the 1928 San Felipe hurricane for the areas affected.[4] Nearly 500,000\u00a0animals were also killed, including cows, goats, horses, pigs, and poultry.[4] The steamships Jean and Acacia took refuge at Ensenada Honda, where the hurricane made landfall. Both ships were grounded by the storm but were refloated after unloading cargo. Several pier buildings at the Port of San Juan  sustained heavy damage. The three-masted schooner Gaviota was wrecked in the harbor. The bridge and ship's boats of another vessel in the harbor were blown away.[6] Many smaller ships along the waterfront were driven aground.[20] Telephone and telegraph lines between San Juan and the eastern parts of Puerto Rico were disrupted on the night of September\u00a026. The worst of the storm reached San Juan shortly after midnight on the morning of September\u00a027 and lasted for about three hours;[4] hurricane-force winds lasted for six hours.[18] Winds of at least 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) occurred in San Juan, though the local measurement tower measured a peak wind of 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h) before it was toppled by the storm.[6]  In San Juan, Hato Rey, and R\u00edo Piedras, hundreds of homes were blown away and trees were uprooted.[4] Reports indicated that all homes collapsed in Fajardo and Toa Alta. Many small towns outside of the San Juan area were left in similar circumstances.[21] All communication and electric poles and wires were knocked down.[4] WKAQ's radio towers lay toppled and contorted by the wind.[20] The carnage littered streets with debris.[4] Rainfall totals in Puerto Rico were lower overall than in other hurricanes of similar strength. The maximum total of 16.70\u00a0in (424\u00a0mm) was measured in Maricao.[6]  Damage to both property and crops amounted to $35.6\u00a0million, with $15.6\u00a0million inflicted upon property and $20\u00a0million inflicted upon crops. The Puerto Rican Department of Commerce that the damage parlayed into $31.2\u00a0million in economic losses for agriculture.[4] The main citrus-producing regions of Puerto Rico were located within the swath of the heaviest damage; its losses accounted for the largest proportion of crop losses. Though the main coffee tree plantations did not experience the storm's strongest winds, they were heavily damaged by fallen banana trees; banana trees had been planted to provide temporary shading for the new coffee crop following the 1928 San Felipe hurricane but were susceptible to moderate winds. The toll inflicted on citrus and coffee trees delayed their harvests by several years. The hurricane rendered other crops a total loss, though to an extent recoverable within a growing season.[6] Approximately $2.4\u00a0million worth of agricultural plantations and structures constructed using recovery funds from the 1928\u00a0hurricane were destroyed.[22] Forests along the Sierra de Luquillo were defoliated and exhibited high tree mortality after being lashed by the heavy rains and strong winds.[23] East of the Puerto Rican mainland, Culebra and Vieques also sustained heavy damage.[6] Workers from the Puerto Rican Department of the Interior, assisted by prisoners and volunteers, quickly cleared roads of debris once the storm passed. National Guard and Red Cross personnel were promptly dispatched into the affected areas to aid recovery efforts; medical and food supplies were distributed in the larger impacted municipalities within 24\u00a0hours of the storm's passage.[4] Some of the relief efforts were also managed by the Puerto Rican Hurricane Relief Commission that was formed in response to the 1928\u00a0hurricane.[22] For the 1932\u00a0storm, a Hurricane Relief and Rehabilitation Commission was formed on September\u00a027 in cooperation with the Red Cross, split into an executive committee and two subcommittees. One subcommittee was tasked with enforcing price controls while the other was tasked with raising relief funds for immediate purchases of materials and to supplement the Red Cross's efforts; nearly $75,000 was collected by this second committee. The funds augmented an emergency fund established by the Puerto Rican government in April\u00a01932; $165,000 in relief was sourced from this fund, including a $50,000 loan to the Fruit Growers Cooperative Credit Association for the recovery of the citrus crop and acquisition of fertilizer. Food and shelter relief was administered by the Red Cross. Additional supplies were made available to these committees by the American military stationed in Puerto Rico. Two reconnaissance flights were arranged on September\u00a027 and 28 to better determine the extent and severity of the damage across northern Puerto Rico. Teachers were enlisted by the Department of Education to appraise the total property damage while crop damage was tallied by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce. The Red Cross reported that 76,925\u00a0families were in \"actual distress\" due to the hurricane.[4] The destruction of homes rendered 25,000\u00a0families homeless.[24] Total economic losses from the storm were equivalent to 20\u00a0percent of Puerto Rico's gross income.[25]"

The concern prompted residents to close businesses and evacuate; some took to nearby churches for shelter.[26] The 1932\u00a0storm produced 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) winds in San Pedro de Macor\u00eds and 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) winds in Santo Domingo.[6] Agricultural sectors of Santo Domingo sustained \"considerable damage\".[27] Hurricane warning flags were raised in Jamaica on September\u00a029. Storeowners secured their vulnerable storefronts and awnings while ships at harbor were moved to shelter.[28] The storm ultimately passed south of Jamaica with little consequence.[29] Signal flags warning of the storm's approach were first hoisted in the British Honduras on October\u00a01, leading to the closure of businesses and the commencement of storm preparations.[30] However, the storm moved over the British Honduras with little force, causing no damage.[31]"

Within the eight provinces, 20% of the farmland and 35% of the entire wheat crop was impacted.[4] By February 2011, the drought hit a total of up to 7,730,000 hectares (19,100,000 acres) of winter wheat that had already been planted.[1] Some lakes, including Lake Hong in Hubei province, dried up significantly, with the Hubei lake shrinking to one-eighth of its normal surface area and one-fifth its usual depth, forcing 3,234 local residents to relocate.[5] According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the potential of damage to China's wheat harvest was likely a factor in an increase of worldwide wheat prices in early 2011.[2] By the start of June, the drought had affected 35 million people, including 4.2 million facing a drinking water shortage. Direct economic damage had reached 15 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion USD), while several provinces resorted to using cloud seeding to induce artificial rain.[5] On 24 June, 3.65 million people and 3.47 million heads of livestock were short of drinking water in \nthe autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia and the provinces of Gansu and Shanxi despite the flooding in other parts of China.[6]"

Convection increased and became better organized as a weak tropical wave reached the area, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Twenty at around 1200\u00a0UTC on December 4 while located about 345 miles (555\u00a0km) south of Kingston, Jamaica;[1] initially, the depression was forecast to track north-northeastward and pass over western Haiti.[6] Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone, the depression was embedded within the southwesterly flow between a ridge over the eastern Caribbean Sea and a mid-latitude trough, which caused a steady east-northeast motion.[6] The convection organized into a central dense overcast with a well-defined cloud band wrapping partially around the center, and based on satellite imagery estimates the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status; late on December 4, the National Hurricane Center named the storm Odette.[7] After being named, the storm intensified despite moderate southwesterly wind shear, and an eye feature became evident on microwave satellite imagery.[1] Additionally, about three\u2013fourths of a mid-level eyewall developed.[8] The storm was assessed with winds of 40\u201350\u00a0mph (64\u201380\u00a0km/h), though the National Hurricane Center remarked the winds could have been stronger due to lack of structural data. The eye feature diminished as the convective structure deteriorated slightly, and hurricane hunters first flew into the storm at around 1200\u00a0UTC on December 5.[1] Odette tracked over an area of warm sea surface temperatures,[8] and the overall cloud pattern gradually improved;[9] the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the storm to attain hurricane status.[10] Early on December 6, a TRMM overpass showed an 80% closed eyewall,[11] and at 0600\u00a0UTC Odette attained peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) while located about 245 miles (394\u00a0km)/h) southwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.[1] Upon reaching peak intensity, Odette had begun accelerating northeastward, which decreased wind shear and slightly increased its southwesterly outflow.[11] The low-level center decelerated as it approached Hispaniola, though the convection continued quickly northeastward. Failing to maintain vertical organization, Odette weakened slightly and made landfall on Jaragua National Park, in the Pedernales Province of the Dominican Republic, around 2300\u00a0UTC on December 6 with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). The circulation became disrupted as it crossed the country, and on December 7 it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean with winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h).[1] It accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front, and late on December 7 Odette transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center became embedded within the front. The remnants continued quickly northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on December 9;[1] the frontal zone that absorbed Odette also absorbed Tropical Storm Peter a few days later.[12]"

At least 2,000 shelters were set up, capable of housing up to 800,000\u00a0people. In addition, the government mobilized the army to force those unwilling to leave from their homes. Such precautions were taken due to already saturated grounds from heavy rainfall three weeks prior.[13] A tropical storm watch was issued between Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic/Haiti border on December 4, 56\u00a0hours prior to landfall. This was raised to a tropical storm warning on December 5 while 32\u00a0hours before landfall. In addition, tropical storm warnings were issued for all of the Haitian coastline and Jamaica.[1]"

The rainfall caused mudslides and flash flooding,[1] forcing several rivers to overflow in combination with previous rains.[15] In addition, a tornado was reported near Santo Domingo, destroying one house and uproofing several others.[13] The flooding and mudslides damaged up to 60,000 homes and destroyed 34. Gusty winds caused power outages. River flooding caused two bridges to collapse, isolating several communities. Landslides buried several roads, though authorities quickly repaired them. The rainfall also flooded fields, resulting in severe crop damage.[13] As much as 85% of the banana crop was lost, while the coffee crop suffered losses shortly before harvest season. Crop damage totaled to around $8\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD).[16] In addition, excess flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving several areas without clean water or sanitation.[17] In all, Tropical Storm Odette caused 8 deaths and 14 injuries, mostly due to flash flooding and mudslides. In addition, two indirect deaths are associated with the storm due to heart attacks. Neighboring Haiti experienced little from the storm.[1]"

Delta Air Lines canceled over 2,000 flights,[5] and it was reported by 8:00\u00a0p.m. Thursday, February 13, that as many as 6,500 flights originating in or destined for the United States had been canceled. On that day 70 percent of flights were cancelled at airports in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Charlotte.[6][7] Approximately 1.2 million homes and businesses lost power as the storm moved from the South through the Northeast.

        "content": "On February 11, a quick-moving area of low pressure moved across the Southeast, bringing rain and snow to areas like Atlanta, interacting with some of the cold air to the north of it. It then quickly moved offshore by roughly 3 p.m.[9] This part of the storm was only the beginning of a crippling 2-day streak of winter nightmares across the South. Accumulations from this half of the winter storm ranged anywhere from 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6\u00a0cm) of snow and a glaze of icing across the South. Later on February 11, another area of low pressure formed on the extreme southern edge of the Gulf Coast, near the TX\u2013LA border. Drawing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, it was able to fire up a small area of showers and thunderstorms near the coastline. As it tracked eastward, it began to interact with the cold air above it, producing an area of ice and snow on its backside as it moved to the east. On February 12, the swath of ice exploded in size as the conditions for freezing rain began to come together. Areas from eastern Alabama, including Atlanta in Georgia to the Southeast coast and South Carolina were included in this swath of icy precipitation. Meanwhile, to the south, near the Gulf Coast, heavy showers and thunderstorms were consisted in a streak of rain stretching up to southern parts of Georgia. As the low moved east, it then dissipated as a new area of low pressure developed off the South Carolina coast late on February 12, and that began to strengthen as it tracked to the north, placing the Northeast in the fire zone for the winter storm.[10] Early on February 13, more snow began to develop on the northern side of the storm as the precipitation shield approached the New York metropolitan area in colder air. Heavy bands of snow set up as the system began its transition into a nor'easter, with some of these bands containing snowfall rates of up to 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1\u00a0cm) per hour. At the same time, warmer air was beginning to funnel into the storm system, and as a result the rain/snow line slowly creeped up the state of New Jersey as the warm air began to further intrude into the winter storm. By 10 a.m, most of the precipitation had moved north of New York City, and began to reach into areas like Boston. Even though the area of low pressure, which had now deepened to 988 millibars (29.2\u00a0inHg)[11] late on February 13, was offshore of the East Coast, little to no precipitation was falling as a result of dry air to funnel its way into the storm. Most of the snow totals in this areas ranged anywhere from 6\u201324 inches (0.50\u20132.00\u00a0ft), as a result. The system then continued to depart from the East Coast, before finally dissipating on February 24 near Europe.[1]"

Precipitation started as light rain late on the 10th, with significant snow by the following morning while still above freezing, turning back to light rain before ending by mid-day. More light rain began after midnight, changing to snow as temperatures fell, then to sleet, freezing rain, back to sleet again before another significant snow by the morning of the 13th. Areas north of the city generally got mostly snow and sleet, while a large swath from the south metro area eastward got the heaviest ice accumulations, though a dry slot at mid-day proved to be much more of a factor in limiting accumulations than had previously been forecast. The worst damages occurred in east Georgia, where over 80% of Augusta was left in the dark, and the Augusta National Golf Club was left littered with branches and other damaged landscaping just a few weeks before the Masters Tournament, in addition to a leaking water tower. The historic Eisenhower Tree, located on the 17th hole of the golf course, suffered irreversible damage and had to be removed.[13] The storm damaged $65 million worth of timber.[14] Further concerning residents was a magnitude 4.1 earthquake two days later, followed by a 3.2 aftershock two days later, at which time most power had been restored, after the storm.[citation needed] Several people were injured in sledding accidents. One being taken to a hospital near Holly Springs was in an ambulance that was hit by a skidding car, which then hit a Georgia National Guard vehicle that was escorting the ambulance. The GNG vehicle then took the young child the rest of the way to get medical attention for the original injuries (none were incurred by anyone during the accident). One woman died of hypothermia without heat in her home. The Oconee County Sheriff's Office jokingly canceled Valentine's Day, while many florists were late for deliveries to customers after their own incoming flower shipments were delayed.[citation needed] By late February 16, only a few hundred were still without power in east Georgia.[citation needed]"

The pattern continued mostly uninterrupted throughout the winter and numerous significant winter storms affected the Eastern United States, with the most notable one being a powerful winter storm that dumped ice and snow in the Southeastern United States and the Northeastern United States in mid-February. Most of the cold weather abated by the end of March, though a few winter storms did affect the Western United States towards the end of the winter. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2013 occurred on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2014 occurred on March 20.[1] Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28.[2] Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability."

Additionally, notable events and below-average temperatures continued well into March and past the official end of winter, with total damages as a result of thr winter weather and cold temperatures exceeding $5 billion (2014 USD). Significant winter weather events began early, with a major storm system affecting the Great Plains and Deep South in early October. Some of the mountainous areas received nearly 4 feet (48\u00a0in; 120\u00a0cm) of snow along with gusty winds creating blizzard conditions, while a significant tornado outbreak occurred further southeast in the warm sector.[5] Afterwards, little activity occurred until mid-November, where an arctic front brought the first snowfall and cold temperatures to much of the Northeastern United States. Shortly before and throughout the Thanksgiving holiday, a widespread and large winter storm caused numerous impacts in areas ranging from the Texas panhandle to the interior Northeastern U.S., with heavy snow totals and ice accumulations occurring in the state; the same storm would then bring mostly rain to the Northeast.[6][7]"

As a result of the shallow depth of the front, once the front reached parts of the higher terrain in northwestern Arkansas, the front stalled, leaving areas just ahead of the front significantly colder than areas behind it.[36] While temperatures in much of the Plains remained at or below freezing, an upper low was forming over the Southwestern United States. As the low pushed eastward and northeastward across parts of eastern New Mexico and West Texas,[37] it interacted with moisture over the Southern Plains; there was an unusually high amount of moisture across the area for December, and the low drew much of it over the cold air-mass near the surface.[36] With the moisture in place, light rain began to fall in some locations prior to sunset. The rain persisted and spread from southwest to northeast overnight, with moderate rain beginning to fall across much of Southwest, Central, and northeastern Oklahoma and Southeast Kansas.[37] By late morning on December 21, much of the rain had ended in Southwest and Central Oklahoma, where many areas had received over 0.25 inches (0.64\u00a0cm) of ice accumulation with some locations receiving over 0.50 inches (1.3\u00a0cm) or even, in localized areas, 0.75 inches (1.9\u00a0cm) of ice; isolated power outages occurred, and multiple trees and tree limbs were broken and/or pulled down by the weight of the ice.[35] Heavy icing continued along the Interstate 44 corridor and parts of Osage County in Oklahoma; in these areas, there were reports of 0.50\u20130.75 inches (1.3\u20131.9\u00a0cm) of ice, and in southeastern Oklahoma and extreme northwestern Arkansas, there were lesser reports of 0.25\u20130.50 inches (0.64\u20131.27\u00a0cm) of ice.[36] Additional ice totals occurred in Southeast Kansas, where there were isolated locations which received ice accumulations of as high as 0.75 inches (1.9\u00a0cm).[37]"

Then, as it neared the coast, a new area of low pressure developed off the Outer Banks and began to move northwards, as snowfall expanded into parts of the Mid-Atlantic; consequently, by 15:00 UTC on January 21, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) initiated storm summary bulletins for the developing winter storm.[46] A heavy band of precipitation set up from the cities of Philadelphia to New York City as a result of rapid deepening, leading to high snowfall rates along this corridor and the heaviest accumulations of the event.[47] Near-blizzard conditions occurred up and down the Interstate 95 corridor, with blizzard warnings issued for southeastern New England. The system, which was not well-forecast in advance and was stronger than anticipated by many, also struck at or near rush hour, which created hazardous conditions and impacts from Washington D.C. to Boston, Massachusetts.

As this occurred, a southern stream upper-level trough translated in an eastward direction across northern parts of Mexico. This also coincided with the backing of low-level winds along the western Gulf Coast. Relatively warm and humid air overrode the colder air near the surface, resulting in precipitation falling in Texas, Louisiana, and parts of the Southeastern U.S. as a mixture of rain, freezing rain, and snow. Late in the day, a broad northern stream upper-level trough containing a trough axis was located over the Central and Eastern United States, and the storm began to develop as this trough axis, initially reaching from the Upper Midwest to the northern Rocky Mountains, sharpened and moved in a southeastward direction during the following 24-hour period. This activity coincided with the movement of additional cold air at the surface. Many areas experiencing liquid precipitation falling at the surface saw rain switch over to freezing rain by 12:00 UTC January 28 as temperatures dropped. A mixture of frozen to partly frozen precipitation spread eastward over the following period into the early hours of January 29, impacting much of the Deep South. Widespread ice accumulations in excess of .25 inches (6.4\u00a0mm) occurred as a result of the event. As the southern stream trough axis weakened while it moved eastward across the western Gulf of Mexico, a northern stream trough amplified as it headed toward the Southeastern U.S. Overrunning wintry precipitation affected the area as a weak surface low traveled along the front and crossed into the Atlantic.[49]"

It then quickly moved offshore by roughly 3 p.m.[50] This part of the storm was only the beginning of a crippling 2-day streak of winter nightmares across the South. Accumulations from this half of the winter storm ranged anywhere from 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6\u00a0cm) of snow and a glaze of icing across the South. Later on February 11, another area of low pressure formed on the extreme southern edge of the Gulf Coast, near the TX\u2013LA border. Drawing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, it was able to fire up a small area of showers and thunderstorms near the coastline. As it tracked eastward, it began to interact with the cold air above it, producing an area of ice and snow on its backside as it moved to the east. On February 12, the swath of ice exploded in size as the conditions for freezing rain began to come together. Areas from eastern Alabama, including Atlanta in Georgia to the Southeast coast and South Carolina were included in this swath of icy precipitation. Meanwhile, to the south, near the Gulf Coast, heavy showers and thunderstorms were consisted in a streak of rain stretching up to southern parts of Georgia. As the low moved east, it then dissipated as a new area of low pressure developed off the South Carolina coast late on February 12, and that began to strengthen as it tracked to the north, placing the Northeast in the fire zone for the winter storm.[51] Early on February 13, more snow began to develop on the northern side of the storm as the precipitation shield approached the New York metropolitan area in colder air. Heavy bands of snow set up as the system began its transition into a nor'easter, with some of these bands containing snowfall rates of up to 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1\u00a0cm) per hour. At the same time, warmer air was beginning to funnel into the storm system, and as a result the rain/snow line slowly creeped up the state of New Jersey as the warm air began to further intrude into the winter storm. By 10 a.m, most of the precipitation had moved north of New York City, and began to reach into areas like Boston. Even though the area of low pressure, which had now deepened to 988 millibars (29.2\u00a0inHg)[52] late on February 13, was offshore of the East Coast, little to no precipitation was falling as a result of dry air to funnel its way into the storm. Most of the snow totals in these areas ranged anywhere from 6\u201324 inches (0.50\u20132.00\u00a0ft), as a result."

At the same time, an Alberta clipper was moving through the Upper Midwest, dropping relatively light to moderate snow through the areas. The energy between the clipper system and the remains of the extratropical cyclone combined to produce energy for a long tracked winter storm. Late on March 2, snow and ice began to develop along a weak area of low pressure near Texas and Oklahoma. Numerous locations reported thunderstorms with sleet and freezing rain due to the intense upper-air dynamics and Arctic air at the surface. A small squall line began to set up ahead of the cold front.

The fires had been particularly severe due to the 2011 Southern US drought that covered the state, and was exacerbated by the unusual convergence of strong winds, unseasonably warm temperatures, and low humidity.[5] Timber lost to drought and wildfire in 2011 could have produced $1.6 billion worth of products, resulting in a $3.4 billion economic impact in East Texas.[6] Firefighters from more than forty-three states were involved in combating the fires.[7] Two firefighters were killed. Eastland volunteer firefighter Gregory M. Simmons, 51, died April 15 while battling a 3,000-acre (12\u00a0km2) blaze Friday afternoon near Eastland. Cactus volunteer firefighter Elias Jaquez died April 20 from injuries sustained while fighting a blaze April 9 in Moore County.

On April 16, 2011, Perry asked that President Barack Obama declare 252 of 254 Texas counties as disaster areas due to wildfires and wildfire danger;[10] the request was partially approved on July 1, 2011.[11]  Critics of the governor's relief efforts point to his budget cuts to the Texas Forest Service which provides a first line of defense against wildfires.[12] Overall, wildfires in Texas during 2011 caused $510.927\u00a0million in damages and caused six fatalities, though an additional 62\u00a0people were injured.[13]"

The largest and most destructive was what is now known as the Bastrop County Complex. At approximately 3:00\u00a0p.m. (CDT) on  September 4, two fires started north of Bastrop State Park in the communities of Circle D-KC Estates and Taihitan Village.[16][17] The likely cause of the blaze was sparks from electric power lines. 30\u00a0mph gusts of wind apparently toppled trees which tumbled into electrical lines at two locations, creating sparks that fell onto and ignited the dry grass and leaf litter below. The fire was exacerbated by the outflow of Tropical Storm Lee in conjunction with exceptional drought.[18] The fire quickly spread, engulfing 400 homes.[17] Multiple areas and locales were evacuated, including the Bastrop Animal Shelter, Bastrop State Park (more than half of which was burned), and other communities affected by the fire.[17][19] By 7:30 PM on September 5, 2011, the fire had burned about 25,000 acres and 500 homes. Winds began to calm the evening of September 5, but the fire still had no containment by the evening of September 6. By September 11, 1,554 homes had been destroyed. By October 1, the fire had reached 98% containment but had burned a total of 34,068 acres and 1,645 homes, making it the most destructive fire in Texas history.[20][21] At 8:00 PM on October 10, the fire was declared 100% contained.[22]"

Throughout 2011, the drought was confined to the Deep South as the mid-south received flooding due to severe weather and tornadoes. However, the drought continued and intensified in the Deep South as Texas saw 2011 become its second-driest year on record, Oklahoma saw its fourth-driest, and Georgia saw its seventh-driest year on record. The winter of 2011\u201312 was one of the driest winters on record for the eastern and central United States. In the spring of 2012, the drought made a massive expansion from the Deep South to the Midwest, Mid-south, Great Plains, and Ohio valley. At its peak in August 2012 the drought covered approximately 81% of the United States. Throughout the winter of 2012\u201313, heavy rain and snow brought relief to the drought in the southern and eastern United States, even causing severe flooding. By March 2013, the eastern United States was drought-free, effectively ending the 2010\u201313 southern U.S. drought. Drought continued on the Great Plains until 2014.

        "content": "The drought caused severe lack of water in the southern plains and Rocky Mountains as well as numerous wildfires,[4] in particular the 2011 Texas wildfires, the Wallow Fire and Horseshoe 2 Fire in Arizona, the Whitewater-Baldy Complex Fire and Little Bear Fire in New Mexico, and the 2012 Colorado wildfires in Colorado.[citation needed] Mexico also saw serious impact from the drought which decimated crops, killed over a million cattle, and stressed local water and food supplies. The drought has been described as the worst seen in the country in 70 years.[5][6] By the end of August 2011, a ban on outdoor burning was in effect for 251 of the 254 Texas counties.  Lake levels in Texas had declined vastly, some by as much as 50 feet; E.V. Spence Reservoir dropped below 1% capacity in July 2011.  This revealed various previously submerged items, ranging from a Native American's skull to a Space Shuttle Columbia tank.[7]  On August 30, several homes in Oklahoma City were destroyed along with 1,500 wooded acres. Hundreds of homes had to be evacuated.[8] The drought had a detrimental effect on Texas and Oklahoma cattle ranches, who deeply culled their herds and helped cut the national cattle population to the lowest level in decades.[9] 2012 spring rainfall improved conditions in many parts of Texas and by April 12, 2012, only 14% of the state was in \"exceptional\" drought, compared to 88% at the drought's peak.[10] In spring and summer of 2012, the drought expanded and formed the 2012 North American drought, affecting more than 80% of the contiguous United States.[11] In late summer of 2012, the drought eased in portions of the southern US, but continued to intensify in the central US.[citation needed]"

Farmers and ranchers were among those hardest hit. The Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service estimates that Texas agricultural producers lost nearly $7.6 billion due to the drought.[12] Drought and unprecedented heat made 2011 the worst year for wildfires in Texas history. From Nov. 15, 2010 through Sept. 29, 2011, Texas saw 23,835 fires that burned more than 3.8 million acres and destroyed 2,763 Texas homes.[13] Timber lost to drought and wildfire could have produced $1.6 billion worth of products, resulting in a $3.4 billion economic impact in East Texas.[12]"

The fire has caused the evacuation of over 32,000 residents of Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs and Woodland Park, several small mountain communities along Highway 24, and partial evacuation of the United States Air Force Academy. On the afternoon of June 26, winds increased following a dry thunderstorm that passed west of the fire, within two hours the fire which had been held by firefighters near Rampart Road jumped northeast into Queens Canyon as the fire crested out of Queens Canyon gusts as high as 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) pushed the fire down the front range particularly into the Mountain Shadows neighborhood.

Five minutes later, a third tornado struck. The tornadoes then tracked east over open fields. Damage retrospectively rated F3 on the Fujita scale was observed in places. Two people were killed,[3] a man and a boy, while the drowning of a woman at St Kilda beach is believed to be related to the same storm cell.[4]  Over 6 were injured in the Brighton area.[1] The tornado completely destroyed the Hawthorn Road Methodist church, which was later rebuilt.[4]  Numerous homes were demolished.[4] The tornado badly damaged the Brighton Baths, tore the roof off Royal Terminus Hotel and destroyed the verandah of Grimley's Hotel.[4]  Extensive damage was incurred to infrastructure on the Sandringham railway line.[4]  Several community and sporting facilities were destroyed including the cricket club grandstand and a bandstand.[4]  It also damaged the burial monument of Adam Lindsay Gordon in the Brighton general cemetery.[1]"

        "content": " The February 2007 North American blizzard was a massive winter storm that affected most of the eastern half of North America, starting on February 12, 2007 and peaking on Valentine's Day, February 14. The storm produced heavy snowfalls across the midwestern United States from Nebraska to Ohio and produced similar conditions across parts of the northeastern United States,  and into Canada in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. Significant sleet and freezing rain fell across the southern Ohio Valley and affected portions of the east coast of the United States, including the cities of Boston, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., New York City and Philadelphia. The southern portion of the storm produced severe thunderstorms with numerous tornadoes reported. One tornado hit a subdivision of New Orleans that was still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. In total, this storm system was responsible for 37 deaths across 13 U.S. states and Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec. The NOAA classified the storm as a Category\u00a03 \"Major\" storm.[2]  The National Weather Service has determined that this storm was one of the three largest snowstorms to hit the inland areas of the northeastern United States since 1940.[3]"

        "content": "In sharp contrast to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, led to the development of the storm. An area of low pressure tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region late on the 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of low pressure developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle. Previously, portions of the Great Lakes were hit by a significant lake effect snow event which dumped incredible amounts of snow over portions of central New York. Several areas received over 115 inches (2,900\u00a0mm) of snow in a ten-day period just before the large winter storm as northwesterly winds and unfrozen lake surfaces due to the early winter warm weather favored the heavy snowfall. Several areas across Michigan and Ontario also received significant amounts of snow with locally 1 metre (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) of snow east of Georgian Bay in Ontario.[4]"

        "content": "From February 10 to 11, a low pressure system developed near the Rockies and moved towards the Great Plains of the United States. It later tracked across the Ohio Valley and merged with a new coastal low. It then moved over eastern Quebec on February 14 before exiting northeastern Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador on February 16. It dumped over 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) of snow across numerous areas from Iowa to New Brunswick, including major cities such as Akron, Detroit, Champaign\u2013Urbana, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Springfield, Peoria, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Dayton, Toledo, Cincinnati, London, Hamilton, the Niagara Region, Toronto, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Rochester, Windsor, Syracuse and Albany. This also includes areas such as Northern Oswego County, New York, which received historic lake effect snowfall amounts in the week prior to the storm.[citation needed] In addition to the snowfall, snow squalls coming from Lake Ontario gave local amounts of over 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of snow near the Hamilton and Niagara regions, where 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) of snow had already fallen on February 13.[5] Heavy ice amounts fell for locations along Interstate 95 from Maine to Virginia and west towards southern Ohio and Indiana. Ice was expected for parts of the Canadian Maritimes.[citation needed] This storm became impressive as it moved into the Ohio Valley during the 13th. However, as additional energy moved into the eastern part of the country, a new area of low pressure developed near the North Carolina coast late on the 13th. This allowed mainly light snow to overspread the region from south to north during the early morning hours of the 13th. Low pressure developed in the southern Plains on Monday the 12th as a cold front pushed southward across the Northeast. By Tuesday the 13th, the storm moved eastward across the lower Mississippi Valley while the cold front became stationary in the Carolinas.  On the night of the 13th, the primary low moved into the far eastern Ohio Valley while a secondary low developed on the stalled front in the Carolinas.  During the day on Wednesday the 14th, this secondary low strengthened rapidly and moved northeastward along the mid-Atlantic and New England coasts while the primary low dissipated in the central Appalachians.  By Thursday the 15th, the storm had moved into eastern Canada."

        "content": "Maine Governor John Baldacci declared a state of emergency in order to assure heating oil for residents of the state, which was one of the hardest hit areas by the snowstorm. Due to the additional heavy snowfall, New York Governor Eliot Spitzer called in the National Guard to assist in the snow removal efforts in the areas hit by the lake effect snow storm.[6] In Pennsylvania, Governor Ed Rendell declared a disaster emergency across the entire state on the 15th. PPL Electric Utilities Corporation reported 1,542 customers were without power for a time during the storm in the Lancaster, Harrisburg and Allentown areas. Snow began across between 6 AM and 7 AM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia, Delaware, Chester, Montgomery and Berks counties. The snow then overspread Bucks, Northampton, Lehigh, Carbon, Berks, and most of Schuylkill counties between 8 AM and 10 AM EST, but held off in Monroe County until the early afternoon hours. There was a lull in the precipitation during the evening hours of the 13th especially across southeastern Pennsylvania, however the precipitation became widespread overnight and during the early morning hours of the 14th. As some warmer air began to move in above the surface, the snow mixed with and changed to sleet and freezing rain between 6 PM and 7 PM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties, then between 7 PM and 11 PM across most other areas in eastern Pennsylvania. The southern Poconos saw less mixed precipitation, however there was a period of mixed precipitation between about 7:30 PM on the 13th and 11:30 AM on the 14th. For a brief time during the afternoon of the 14th, temperatures rose a couple of degrees above freezing with no precipitation falling. Temperatures then dropped below freezing again by the late afternoon of the 14th with a period of snow before the precipitation came to an end between 8:30 PM and 10 PM on the 14th. Wraparound snow showers lingered in Monroe and Carbon Counties until 2 AM EST on the 15th. In Berks County, snow and sleet along with very cold temperatures combined with some accidents and other aspects to cause a 50-mile backup on Interstate 78. Many motorists, including more than 100 trucks, were stuck on the interstate for nearly 24 hours, without food, water and running out of fuel. At 12:26 PM on the 14th, a caller tells a 911 center he's been stuck in traffic on westbound Interstate 78 near the Berks-Lehigh county line for more than an hour. At 1:02 PM, a truck driver tells the Berks Communications Center about a seven-mile backup on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 78 near Hamburg. At 4:40 PM, a 911 caller asked to speak to the Berks Emergency Management Agency. The Berks Deputy Coordinator took the call. At 4:59 PM, The Berks Deputy Coordinator called the State Emergency Operations Center and was told the center learned of the backup at 4:33 PM. At 5:22 PM, Berks Emergency Management calls the state police at the Hamburg barracks but cannot get through, so he decided to drive there. At 6:08 PM, the Berks Emergency Management Deputy Coordinator finds that the Hamburg barracks is without power and phones. At 6:27 PM, a senior decision-maker from PennDOT is requested to arrive at the Hamburg state police barracks to help with communications. At 9:30 PM, a PennDOT supervisor arrived in Hamburg.[citation needed] At 10:30 PM, all westbound Interstate 78 traffic is stopped at the Hamburg exit due to numerous disabled vehicles. At 10:40 PM, Governor Ed Rendell declared a disaster emergency. On the 15th at 3:54 AM, state troopers and emergency personnel began walking miles of Interstate 78, waking up truckers who have gone to sleep as traffic begins to move. At 5 PM on the 15th, the state orders Interstate 78 shut down in both directions from Interstate 81 in Lebanon County to Route 100 in Lehigh County. At 6 PM on the 15th, plowing begins and continued through the night. Additional snow removing equipment was brought in from the western part of the state to help with the clearing of the highway. Highway officials along with the National Guard and State Police worked to clear the stuck trucks and cars from the highway, therefore plowing and ice removal can get fully underway. On the 16th, the interstate remained closed throughout the day as crews continued to plow and remove ice. On the 17th at 4 PM, the interstate reopened. The Exeter Township snow emergency, which was declared on the 14th, was extended through 4 PM on the 15th. Several schools across the county were closed on the 14th, with some also closed on the 15th. Across the Lehigh Valley: In Lehigh County, The city of Allentown declared a snow emergency early on the 14th, which was then lifted at 8 PM on the 14th. The weight of snow and ice, on the 14th, brought down the dome over the swimming pool at the West End Racquet and Fitness Club in South Whitehall Township. The dome itself was destroyed. Also, the Brookside Country Club in Wescosville also reported dome damage as a result of the snow and ice. In Northampton County, an 83-year-old woman was found dead on the rear porch of her home from hypothermia. Also in Bethlehem, a pedestrian was hospitalized after a private snowplow operator backed over him while clearing the Sheetz gas station parking lot at 3201 Schoenersville Road on the 14th.[citation needed] County Emergency Dispatch officials reported about a dozen or so minor vehicle accidents due to the slippery conditions. The snow and ice was too much on the 15th for a dome covering a soccer field at the Iron Lakes Sports Club on Shankweiler Road in North Whitehall that it collapsed. In the Poconos, in Carbon County, The Mansion Hill (SR 209) exiting Jim Thorpe towards Lehighton was closed for most of the 14th due to snow slides blocking the major artery or tractor-trailer trucks becoming stuck and blocking the travel lanes. The road reopened about 2:30 PM on the 14th, however it was shut down again at 3:06 PM due to an accident. This was a main trouble spot as the snow and sleet reportedly drifted on the hill across part of the highway. Drifts were reported to be higher than some vehicles. At 8:20 AM on the 14th, it was decided that drifting was occurring more frequently than road crews could clear, resulting in the heavily traveled road being closed. All schools in the county canceled classes as early as the evening of the 13th. Lansford continued their state of emergency on the 15th, which was issued on the 14th. This means that all non-essential travel should be avoided. One accident occurred when a tractor-trailer jack-knifed on the Mansion House Hill, Route 209, in Jim Thorpe at about 4 AM on the 14th. The Pennsylvania Turnpikes Lehighton interchange was closed because of a tractor-trailer crash on the 14th, and state police closed Interstate 81 late in the afternoon of the 14th, deeming it impassable. Interstate 380 also was closed because of bad road conditions. In Monroe County, state police closed Interstates 80 and 380 during the afternoon of the 14th because of bad road conditions. Interstate 80 was closed between Interstates 81 and 380. The combination of a heavy snowfall then a mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain made for hazardous road conditions. The mixed precipitation made it more difficult for some road crews to keep up. At 4 PM EST on the 17th the interstates reopened after ice was removed and the road surfaces was safe for travel. In and around the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area, in Bucks County, slippery road conditions contributed to a tractor-trailer accident on the 14th on Route 309 in Richland Township. The highway was closed for more than an hour, which forced motorists to detour on slush-covered side streets.[citation needed] In Philadelphia itself, the combination of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide made their way to the pavement from high up. Police started to block off areas where the ice was falling, however one man was hit in the head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground. Schenectady, Schoharie, Montgomery, Washington, Essex, Warren and Clinton counties in New York state, which were affected by extensive snowfall from the storm, had declared a state of emergency while several other counties and towns declared snow emergencies.[7][8] Virginia Gov. Timothy Kaine declared a statewide emergency in advance of the storm, directing state agencies to help in the response to and recovery from the storm. Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell declared a statewide disaster emergency in response to the poor road conditions and ensuing highway closings.[9]"

        "header": "Precipitation received",
        "content": "The storm left a mark on Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, which received heavy snow for over 24 hours, accumulating upwards of 18 inches (460\u00a0mm) in some areas. Many parts of Northern and Northeastern Indiana received between 12 and 20 inches (300 and 510\u00a0mm), and blizzard conditions for an extended period of time. The heavy snow and blizzard conditions caused roads to close, and schools and businesses to close for three days. In Chicago, O'Hare International Airport received 10.2 inches (260\u00a0mm) of snow, while Midway Airport received 12 inches (300\u00a0mm). The Midway total was the largest amount of snow received in the month of February for one midnight-to-midnight day since records began to be kept in 1928.[10] In central Illinois, 12 to 16 inches (300 to 410\u00a0mm) of snowfall and blizzard conditions canceled classes at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign for two days, the first time classes had been canceled since 1979.[11][12] Areas of the Appalachian Mountains in northern New England and Quebec received accumulations of over 16 inches (410\u00a0mm) with local amount exceeding 36 inches (910\u00a0mm) in parts of Vermont and 42 inches (1,100\u00a0mm) in the Adirondacks in New York state. Also in New York state, in the hills and valleys south of Syracuse, snowfall depths ranged from 24 to 45 inches (610 to 1,140\u00a0mm). Snowfall rates of 5 to 6 inches (130 to 150\u00a0mm) per hour occurred in areas of western Schoharie County, with total storm accumulations in this county approaching three feet. The city of Hamilton, Ontario and the Niagara region, at their highest elevations, received just over 27.6 inches (700\u00a0mm) due to snow squalls off of Lake Ontario. Burlington, Vermont recorded record 24-hour snowfall, with 25.3 inches (640\u00a0mm).[13] Boston and Hartford, however, saw very little precipitation from the storm. In fact, Boston is[when?] close to setting a record for the least snow in any season.[14] A notable feature of the system was its array of precipitation type. While the interior sections of the Northeast received mostly snow from the system, the Mid-Atlantic received snow, sleet, freezing rain and non-freezing rain. Due to the three-dimensional nature of the atmosphere, warm air was poised to overtake the cold air closer to the ground, causing precipitation to melt, then refreeze as either sleet or freezing rain. As temperatures hovered around freezing on the southern edge of the storm track, light snow accompanied freezing rain and sleet. The freezing rain coated all surfaces with thick layers of ice, including power lines and tree limbs which break under the additional weight. Some locations in the Mid-Atlantic received several inches of sleet. four inches (100\u00a0mm) of sleet caused travel difficulties and hampered cleanup efforts in New York City. New York City's sanitation department admitted to not plowing city streets, expecting the frozen precipitation to change from ice to rain. However, this never happened. Instead, temperatures dropped very quickly and caused the slush on sidewalks and roads to freeze into thick, rock hard sheets of ice. Streets were almost impassable during the evening rush hour resulting in complete chaos. Along coastal New England, a mix of rain, sleet, and freezing rain resulted in decreased snow amounts in coastal areas of New England.in coastal Maine, snowfall amounts were restricted to 6 to 12 inches (150 to 300\u00a0mm), while inland sections of the state got as much as 29.8 inches (760\u00a0mm) of snow. Ice accumulations in Virginia and Maryland reached locally 3\u20444 inch (19\u00a0mm)[15] while it reached 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) in central Ohio near Columbus and Xenia, with up to 0.7 inches (18\u00a0mm) near Cincinnati.[16] The effect on much of Michigan by the storm was light, although the extreme southern part of the state was hard hit with heavy snowfall, especially the Detroit Metro area. Wind whipped snow accumulations ranged from 7 to 10 inches (180 to 250\u00a0mm) fell throughout the area, especially the southeastern suburbs, including 8.5 inches (220\u00a0mm) at both Detroit Metropolitan Airport and Wyandotte, and 8.4 inches (210\u00a0mm) in Dundee. Drifts were as high as 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m), and the snow was very powdery as it fell with temperatures around 10\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212\u00a0\u00b0C). Due to the near-record amounts of snow in the Appalachian Mountain chain, National Weather Service officials had issued statement for a higher risk of avalanches across northern New England.[17]"

        "header": "Damage and travel disruptions",
        "content": "Blizzard conditions were reported across most of the Midwest from Illinois to Ohio. Numerous flights were canceled due to the snow and ice across various airports including in Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal, Kansas City, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cleveland, Boston and Cincinnati. 900 flights were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.[citation needed] Lackawanna County and Luzerne County in Northeastern Pennsylvania received so much snow that every highway was closed. At John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens in New York City, several empty JetBlue airplanes were frozen to the parking stands at the gates and incoming flights could not access the stands as a result, while outgoing flights already taxiing were ordered to hold on the taxiway due to weather conditions.  Many passengers in planes, either inbound or outbound, were held in the planes, eating peanuts and other snacks for as much as 10 hours before the decision was made to cancel the outgoing flights or a gate had opened for the inbound ones.[18][19] Several other airports, including Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Crystal City, Virginia, and John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in Hamilton, Ontario, suspended all flights for several hours.[20][21] GO Train in Toronto and  Amtrak train service from Boston was also disrupted. In Scranton, Pennsylvania the Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain collapsed under the weight of the snow on February 15, 2007. Strong winds also accompanied the storm but damage was minimal, though a radio tower pole was toppled by 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) winds in Ohio.[22] Road traveling was extensively slowed down and numerous accidents and pile-ups were reported across several states and in Ontario. One of the accidents on the Ohio Turnpike involved two tractor-trailers which fell several hundred feet,[23] and another one on Highway 403 in Hamilton involved three tractor-trailers and five cars which forced the closure of the road.[24] Numerous other major roads were also temporarily shutdown, including Highway 401 in Ontario due to a fatal accident in Napanee  and Autoroute 20 and Route 132 in eastern Quebec between Quebec City and Rimouski.[25] In Sherbrooke, Quebec, where nearly 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of snow fell, several hundred students were forced to sleep at schools as buses were unable to travel in the near blizzard conditions. The school board was criticized for opening schools on that day.[26] Severe ice caused a 50-mile (80\u00a0km) stretch of Interstate 78 in Pennsylvania between Lebanon County and Allentown to be shut down, stranding motorists for upwards of 24 hours and requiring the National Guard to be called in.[27] Other stretches of highway throughout Pennsylvania were shut down, including Interstate 80,  81, and after the storm, even the Pennsylvania Turnpike. On February 16, Governor Ed Rendell called for a thorough investigation into how the state handled the winter weather emergency, citing a lack of communication and quick action as the cause of the problems, and even going so far as to taking responsibility for the situation.[28]"

Tornado damage, rather than snow fall, caused Tulane University to cancel classes. Several elementary, middle, and high schools were closed three days in a row in central New York. Public schools in the \"W Towns\" in eastern Massachusetts (Weston, Wayland, and Wellesley) did have school that day despite the fact that almost every other town in the state had the day off. Several schools' classes were canceled after years without a snow day. Dartmouth College shut down campus operations on February 14. Essential employees remained staffed, and classes were held at professors' discretion. It was the first snow day for the college since the 1970s, and its second in its 238-year history. Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio closed its campus for two days, beginning February 13, for the third time in 25 years.[42] Syracuse University canceled all classes after 12:45 pm on Wednesday, closing for only the third time in its 130-year history; for SUNY Geneseo, the previous snow day had occurred 14 years ago;[43] for Ithaca College, the first time in 13 years;[44] for the University of Toledo, the first time in 22 years due to winter-related conditions.[45] The University of Illinois canceled their classes for two consecutive days for the first time in at least 27 years.[46] A blizzard warning forced Purdue University to suspend classes for the first time in 13 years.[47] SUNY Oneonta closed its doors for the first time since the 1970s, and stayed closed for 3\u00a0days for the first time in its 119-year history. Hartwick College had its first recorded snow day in its 230-year history, and stayed closed for 2 days. For the first time in six years, Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio canceled classes as a result of the snow.

Shortly before 7:30\u00a0p.m. a tornado touched down 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) west of downtown Nashville, along the Charlotte Pike and 51st Avenue.[1][3] The tornado intensified as it proceeded into downtown Nashville, shattering windows in the Tennessee State Capitol. The tornado extensively damaged many structures in downtown Nashville and passed only several hundred feet from the U.S. Weather Bureau office.[3] As it crossed the Cumberland River into East Nashville, the tornado burgeoned to 800 yards (732\u00a0m) wide, damaging several four-story factories. Within a 3-mile (4.8\u00a0km) segment of the path through East Nashville, the tornado was particularly damaging to homes, churches, businesses, and schools.[3] In this area alone, the tornado damaged or destroyed at least 1,400 homes and more than 60 other buildings. All of the 11 deaths in Nashville occurred on the east side of the city.[1] The Donelson neighborhood sustained severe damage as homes were reduced to \"splinters\", other buildings were leveled, and trees and power lines were felled.[3] The tornado was last reported in the Hermitage part of Nashville, home to The Hermitage plantation, former residence of U.S. President Andrew Jackson.[3] After traveling 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km), the tornado likely lifted and reformed into a second tornado.[4] Practically no damage occurred in extreme eastern Davidson County.[3] Shortly afterward, the tornado dipped to the ground and re-intensified. In Lebanon, about 228 structures were damaged or destroyed; 20 of them were called \"ruined.\"[3] Two deaths occurred along the outskirts of Lebanon, and two more occurred in the Bellwood suburb of Nashville.[4] In all, the tornado killed 15 people and injured at least 45.[1] The tornado disproved residents' illusion that hills to the southwest protected Nashville from tornadoes.[3] Based on descriptions and photographs of the damage, the tornado is estimated to have been an F3;[1][3] the Fujita scale had not been implemented at that time, and would not be devised until 1971.[5] Damage was estimated at $2.2 million ($27.5 million in 1998 dollars).[3] After the storm, National Guard troops, the Red Cross, Salvation Army officials, and the Boy Scouts quickly responded in the cleanup and recovery efforts. Due to the fast and heavy response of local police, looting and panic was minimal.[3] On April 16, 1998, another F3 tornado, which started near the same point as the 1933 tornado,[3] affected the downtown area. Then, nearly 22 years later, just after midnight on March 3, 2020, an EF3 tornado moved through areas just north of Downtown Nashville nearly affecting some of the same areas as the earlier two storms.[6]"

        "content": " The 1921 Atlantic hurricane season was an active hurricane season, with 12 tropical cyclones forming. Among them, seven became tropical storms, of which five strengthened into hurricanes. Furthermore, two of these strengthened into a major hurricane, Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, the most since the 1917 season.[1] The first system, a tropical depression, developed on June\u00a01, while the last, a tropical storm, dissipated on November\u00a025. Of note, three tropical cyclones co-existed with another during the season. The strongest hurricane of the season, Hurricane Six, peaked as a low-end Category 4 with winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h), before weakening as it approached the Tampa Bay area where it made landfall. Across Florida, it left about $10\u00a0million (1921\u00a0USD) in damage and eight deaths. Two other cyclones left extensive impacts. Although not a tropical cyclone at the time, the remnants of the second hurricane contributed to a devastating flood in the Greater San Antonio area of Texas, which resulted in $19\u00a0million in damage and 215\u00a0fatalities. The third hurricane left thousands homeless in the Lesser Antilles and caused at least 81\u00a0deaths. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 87,[1] above the 1921\u20131930 average of 76.6.[2] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

About 24\u00a0hours later, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. Late on June\u00a017, the storm made landfall in northern Belize with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). The cyclone moved northwestward and weakened slightly while crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, but remained a tropical storm.[3] Early on June\u00a018, the system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and began to curve north-northwestward. Continuing to intensify, it attained hurricane status around 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020. The hurricane drifted and strengthened further. Early on June\u00a022, sustained winds associated with the storm peaked at 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). At approximately 18:00\u00a0UTC, the cyclone made landfall near Matagorda, Texas, at the same intensity.[3] A ship offshore observed a barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg), which would be the lowest in relation to the storm.[4] The hurricane quickly fell to tropical storm intensity, and then weakened to a tropical depression around 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a023. However, the depression persisted for a few more days, until dissipating over northern Missouri on June\u00a026.[3] In Mexico, a weather station at Progreso in Yucat\u00e1n observed winds of 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h). Along the coast of Texas near Matagorda Bay, tides reached approximately 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) above mean low tide, while tides crested exceeded 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) in some parts of West Bay. A storm surge of 7.1 feet (2.2\u00a0m) was measured at Pass Cavallo. Rough seas caused a barge with 18,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal (68,000\u00a0L; 15,000\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) of oil to capsize at Port Aransas. Washouts occurred along the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway between Highland Bayou and Virginia Point. Abnormally high tides also sunk several launches and a number of small boats and damaged many fishing piers.[4] Parts of Texas observed high winds, with Corpus Christi reporting a sustained wind speed of 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h). Winds damaged crops to some extent, shattered windows, toppled signs, and downed some trees. Rainfall totals in Austwell, Columbus, Edna, Hempstead, Matagorda, Navasota, Pierce, Rosenberg, and Sealy all set records for the most precipitation for any day in the month of June in their respective towns.[5] One death occurred in Longview when a man was struck by lightning, with the same bolt also killing two calves and a cow.[6]"

The storm then curved west-northwestward and reached hurricane intensity about twenty four hours. Around that time,[3] the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and an estimated minimum barometric pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). At 03:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, the hurricane made landfall in Mexico just north of Tampico, Tamaulipas.[4] After moving inland, the storm weakened and dissipated early on September\u00a08.[3] After the cyclone dissipated on September\u00a08, an extremely heavy rainfall event ensued across central Texas, which continued into September\u00a011. In Williamson County, a new 18-hour rainfall record was set for the United States as 36.40\u00a0in (925\u00a0mm) was recorded at Thrall;[7] the storm total rainfall there was 39.71\u00a0in (1,009\u00a0mm).[8] The deluge led to one of the most destructive floods in the history of San Antonio. Water rose to 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) deep in the city, forcing people to evacuate vertically within taller buildings. The most significant river floods occurred along the Little and San Gabriel rivers, where 159\u00a0people perished. Combined with the death toll from elsewhere across the region, 215\u00a0people died due to this storm and damages were estimated at $19\u00a0million.[5]"

The storm moved northwestward across the Caribbean and intensified into a major hurricane on September\u00a09. Thereafter, the cyclone began to curve northward, and early on September\u00a011, it made landfall in the Dominican Republic near Boca de Yuma at peak intensity as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h). The storm weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane after striking the island, but re-strengthened into a Category\u00a03 while northeast of the Bahamas on September\u00a013. The storm curved northeastward on September\u00a014 and began accelerated. On the following day, the system weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane near Bermuda. Early on September\u00a017, the system weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane and soon transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 310\u00a0mi (500\u00a0km) east of Newfoundland.[3] The remnants were absorbed by a larger extratropical storm later on September\u00a017.[4] On Grenada, a number of homes were destroyed, while several other buildings suffered damage. The storm severely damaged nutmeg and cocoa crops, the latter of which was estimated to require at least seven years to be re-established. Telephone communications in rural areas were lost. At least two deaths occurred on the island. On Saint Vincent, trees and telegraph and telephone lines were downed. Extensive crop and property damage was reported,[4] with thousands of people left homeless.[9] Strong winds on Trinidad disrupted telegraphic communications. A number of lights and small craft at Port of Spain and San Fernando were sunk or washed ashore. Two fatalities occurred on the island, one from drowning and the other from electrocution. Throughout the Windward Islands, 80\u00a0deaths were reported. Strong winds generated by the storm caused extensive damage to buildings in Puerto Rico and Bermuda,[4] with one fatality in the former.

Several neighborhoods and sections of Tampa were inundated, especially in Ballast Point, DeSoto Park, Edgewater Park, Hyde Park, Palmetto Beach, and other areas in the vicinity of Bayshore Boulevard.[12] Strong winds also damaged hundreds of trees, signs, buildings, and homes.[13] Five deaths occurred in Tampa, two from drowning and three after people came into contact with a live wire. The storm left two additional fatalities in St. Petersburg.[12] A number of streets in Tarpon Springs were littered with masses of debris,[14] with many structures and trees suffering extensive damage.[15] Strong winds occurred as far east as the Atlantic coast of the state, though wind damage east of the Tampa Bay area was generally limited to downed trees and power lines, resulting in power outages, particularly in Orlando.[16] Agriculture throughout the state experienced significant impact as well, including over $2\u00a0million in damage and the loss of at least 800,000\u00a0boxes of citrus crops alone.[17] Overall, the hurricane left at least eight deaths and about $10\u00a0million in damage.[12][18]"

The depression tracked northwestward and made landfall in Franklin County, Florida, early on July\u00a029. It dissipated over Georgia by the next day. A tropical depression formed in the Bay of Campeche on September\u00a023. The depression moved westward into Mexico just north of Veracruz and is believed to have dissipated later that day. Veracruz recorded a wind gust of 29\u00a0mph (47\u00a0km/h). The final system which failed to reach tropical storm intensity formed over the Bay of Campeche on October\u00a05 as a low pressure system along a decaying cold front. The depression made landfall in Mexico and rapidly dissipated. Wind speeds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) at Veracruz and Villahermosa suggest that the depression may have become a tropical storm.[4]"

Most systems traveled generally westward or northwestward, and two reached as far as the waters south of the Hawaiian Islands. The most significant system this year was Hurricane Ava, which was the most intense Pacific hurricane on record at the time. Several other much weaker tropical cyclones came close to, or made landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico.

Of those hurricanes, three of them were major hurricanes because they reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.[3] These totals are all below the long-term averages of thirteen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes.[4] At the time, this season's total of twelve named tropical cyclones was exactly average, although at the time the climatology in this basin was weak because satellite coverage was spotty before 1966.[5] This season, all advisories and tropical cyclone data were released and collected by two agencies, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in Redwood City, California,[6] and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu, Hawaii,[7] both of which were coextensive with the National Weather Service Forecast Offices in their respective cities.[8][9] The EPHC covered the area between the coast of North America and 140\u00b0W,[6] and the CPHC the remainder of the area.[7]"

Two days later, it became a major hurricane and it sped up. On June 7, it became a Category\u00a05 hurricane. It then started weakening and slowed down until it dissipated on June 12.[3] No deaths or damages were attributed to Hurricane Ava.[2] Ava's minimum central pressure was 915 millibars, and its maximum sustained winds reached 140 knots (260\u00a0km/h). This made Ava the most intense recorded east Pacific hurricane at the time. Ava reached Category\u00a05 intensity on June 7, the earliest date in an east Pacific season that a hurricane has done so. It was also the second known Category\u00a05 storm in the east Pacific; (behind Patsy in 1959). Ava is the strongest June storm, the fifth most intense east Pacific hurricane, and was the only June Category\u00a05 on record until 2010.[3] Ava was also flown into by hurricane hunter aircraft in what was the first penetration of a Pacific hurricane by NOAA aircraft.[10] During these flights, radars and other devices were tested, and wind speed, pressure, and wave heights were measured. This is the reason why Hurricane Ava's pressure is measured instead of estimated.[10] Ava was also photographed from Skylab because it was visible during one of the missions. At that time, it was coincidentally on the surface of the Earth directly underneath the space station.[11] All in all, these made Hurricane Ava one of the best-observed Pacific hurricanes at the time."

It then weakened steadily as its path carried it on a direct path to the Big Island of Hawaii. Doreen weakened to a tropical storm as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on July 25.[3] A frontal system stuck between two high-pressure areas weakened as the two areas merged, creating a larger high pressure area that turned Doreen to the southwest on July 27. The hurricane then turned back to the northwest and strengthened back into a hurricane. It became a major hurricane again before weakening. Doreen dissipated August 3. Its remnant vortex continued westward until it dissipated under a trough near the dateline.[7] Doreen's sudden change of track and restrengthening was unusual.[2] From formation to dissipation, Doreen lasted 16.25 days and traveled a distance of 4,200\u00a0mi (6,760\u00a0km).[3][2] This tied Hurricane Celeste's record for longest-lasting Pacific hurricane. Doreen was also the longest-lasting July tropical cyclone.[3] Hurricane Fico broke both of these records in the 1978 season.[3][12] Doreen remains the eighth-longest lasting Pacific tropical cyclone, tied with two other storms.[3] Several ships encountered Doreen. The most serious incident involved a Greek ship called Cornelia which lost its rudder in 35\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) waves, but managed to escape and continue on its way to Panama. On the afternoon of July 29, 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) swells and 3.5\u00a0ft (1.1\u00a0m) waves were seen from Kapoho.[7] Otherwise, no damages or deaths were blamed on this tropical cyclone.[2][7]"

Deep convection decreased after landfall[8] and it dissipated within 24 hours after formation, early on October 13.[9] But the storm's remnants continued to effect Central America, until late on October 13, when the remnants of Twelve-E were completely absorbed by a monsoon trough, directly to the remnant's east.

Authorities confirmed the deaths of at least twenty three people, and there were up to 30,000 storm victims in the country.[13][14] According to preliminary reports, heavy downpours caused extensive infrastructural damage and the collapse of six bridges in Nicaragua. Several telephone and electricity poles were downed, disrupting service to customers. Storm-related incidents caused the deaths of at least five people and affected around 3,000 others to some degree.[13][15] Similar impact was reported in El Salvador, where over 15.7 in (400\u00a0mm) of rain fell in several locations.[16] At the risk of flooding, The maximum precipitation was in Huizucar, with 1513\u00a0mm,[17] this being the highest cumulative rainfall for the country, up to 4,300 residents sought shelter in schools, churches and public centers. At least 21 rivers burst their banks due to the flooding rains, while numerous mudslides inflicted damage to roads.

The ninth tropical storm, seventh hurricane, fifth major hurricane, and second Category 5 of the season, Hattie originated from an area of low pressure that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 27. Moving generally northward, the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day. Hattie then turned westward west of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category\u00a05 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h). It weakened to Category\u00a04 before making landfall south of Belize City on October 31. The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November\u00a01. Hattie first affected the southwestern Caribbean, where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on San Andres Island. It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba, prompting evacuations on the island. While turning west, Hattie dropped heavy rainfall of up to 11.5\u00a0in (290\u00a0mm) on Grand Cayman. The country of Belize, at the time known as British Honduras, sustained the worst damage from the hurricane.[nb 1] The former capital, Belize City, was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful storm surge. The territory governor estimated that 70% of the buildings in the city had been damaged, leaving more than 10,000 people homeless. The destruction was so severe that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city, Belmopan. Overall, Hattie caused about $60 million in losses[nb 2] and 307 deaths in the territory. Although damage from Hattie was heavier than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000 people, the death toll from Hattie was considerably lower as a result of early warnings. Elsewhere in Central America, Hattie killed 12 people."

At 0000 UTC on October 27, a ship nearby reported southerly winds of 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h). Later that day, the airport on San Andres Island reported easterly winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). The two observations confirmed the presence of a closed wind circulation, centered about 70 miles (110\u00a0km) southeast of San Andres, or 155\u00a0mi (249\u00a0km) east of the Nicaraguan coast; as a result, the Miami Weather Bureau began issuing advisories on the newly formed Tropical Storm Hattie.[3] After being classified, Hattie moved steadily northward, passing very near or over San Andres Island. A station on the island recorded a pressure of 991\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg) and sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), which indicated that Hattie had reached hurricane status.[3] Late on October 28, a Hurricane Hunters flight encountered a much stronger hurricane, with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) in a small area near the center. At the time, gale-force winds extended outward 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km) to the northeast and 70 miles (110\u00a0km) to the southwest.[2] Early on October 29, a trough extending from Nicaragua to Florida was expected to allow Hattie to continue northward, based on climatology for similar hurricanes.[3] Later that day, Hattie was forecast to be an imminent threat to the Cayman Islands and western Cuba.[2] Around that time, a strengthening ridge to the north turned the hurricane northwestward, which spared the Greater Antilles but increased the threat to Central America.[3] With the strengthening ridge to its north, Hattie began restrengthening after retaining the same intensity for about 24 hours.[3][4] Initially, forecasters at the Miami Weather Bureau predicted the storm to turn northward again. Late on October 29, the center of the hurricane passed about 90 miles (140\u00a0km) southwest of Grand Cayman, at which time the interaction between Hattie and the ridge to its north produced squally winds of around 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) across Florida. Early on October 30, the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the increase in intensity, reporting winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[2] The storm's minimum central pressure continued to drop throughout the day, reaching 924\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg) by 1300 UTC; a lower pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg) was computed at 1700 UTC that day, based on a flight-level reading from the Hurricane Hunters.[3] Hattie later curved toward the west-southwest, passing between the Cayman Islands and the Swan Islands. Late on October 30, Hattie attained peak winds of 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h), concomitantly with a minimum central pressure of 914\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg), about 190\u00a0mi (310\u00a0km) east of the border of Mexico and British Honduras. This made Hattie a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, making it the latest hurricane on record to reach the status until a reanalysis of the 1932 season revealed that Hurricane Fourteen had a similar intensity on November 5, six days after Hattie.[4] Additionally, Hattie was the strongest October hurricane in the northwest Caribbean until Hurricane Mitch in 1998.[5] Hattie maintained much of its intensity as it continued toward the coast of British Honduras. After moving through several small islands offshore, the hurricane made landfall a short distance south of Belize City on October 31, with an eyewall of about 25 miles (40\u00a0km) in diameter.[3] Based on a post-season analysis, it was determined that Hattie had weakened to winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) before moving ashore. During landfall, a ship anchored between Belize City and Stann Creek registered a minimum central pressure of 924\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[4] The hurricane deteriorated rapidly over land, dissipating on November\u00a01 as it moved into the mountains of Guatemala. During its dissipation, Tropical Storm Simone was developing off the Pacific coast of Guatemala,[3][4] however, later analysis concluded that Simone was not a tropical cyclone at all. Later, Tropical Storm Inga formed from a complex interaction with the remnants of Hattie and nearby disturbed weather.[6]"

As the hurricane neared the island, the airport was closed due to tropical-storm-force winds.[3] Rough seas and winds damaged private property and two hotels. Many palm tree plantations were devastated. The schooner Admirar, anchored in one of the island's bays, capsized during the storm.[10] Overall, Hattie resulted in one death, fifteen injuries, and $300,000 in damage (1961 USD) in San Andr\u00e9s. The hurricane was the fourth on record to strike the island, and of the four was the only to approach from the south.[3] In the northwestern Caribbean, Hattie passed close to Grand Cayman with heavy rainfall. At least 11.5 inches (290\u00a0mm) of rain were reported on the island, including 7.8 inches (200\u00a0mm) in six hours.[2] Winds on Grand Cayman were below hurricane force, and only minor damage occurred due to the rain.[2] The interaction between Hattie and the ridge of high pressure to its north produced sustained winds of 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) across most of Florida, with a gust of 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) reported at Hillsboro Inlet Light; the winds caused some beach erosion in the state.[2] The U.S. Weather Bureau issued a small craft warning for the west and east Florida coastlines, as well as northward to Brunswick, Georgia.[11] Later, Hattie impacted various countries in Central America with flash floods, causing 11 deaths in Guatemala and one fatality in Honduras.[3] The Swan Islands reported wind gusts just below hurricane force, resulting in minor damage and one injury.[2]"

        "content": "Hurricane Hattie moved ashore in British Honduras with a storm tide of up to 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) near Belize City,[3] a city of 31,000 people located at sea level; its only defenses against the storm tide were a small seawall and a strip of swamp lands.[12] The capital experienced high waves and a 10\u00a0ft (3\u00a0m) storm tide along its waterfront that reached the third story of some buildings. A trained observer estimated winds of over 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), and winds in the territory were unofficially estimated as strong as 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h).[3] When Hattie affected the area, most buildings in Belize City were wooden, and most of this type were destroyed.[9] Offshore, the hurricane heavily damaged 80% of the Belize Barrier Reef, although the reef recovered after the storm.\n[13] High winds caused a power outage,[12] downed trees across the region, and destroyed the roofs of many buildings.[14] Governor Colin Thornley estimated that more than 70% of the buildings in the territory were damaged, and more than 10,000 people were left homeless.[9] Some shelters set up before the storm were destroyed in the hurricane.[2] The hurricane destroyed the wall at an insane asylum, which allowed the residents to escape.[14] High waves damaged a prison,[15] prompting officials to institute a \"daily parole\" program for the inmates.[14] Hattie also flooded the Government House, washing away all records.[15] All of Belize City was coated in a layer of mud and debris,[14] and majority of the city was destroyed or severely damaged, as was nearby Stann Creek.[3] The hurricane left significant crop damage across the region, including $2\u00a0million in citrus fruits and similar losses to timber, cocoa, and bananas.[3] The year's production of sugar cane was also heavily damaged. About 70% of the territory's mahogany trees were downed, as were most citrus and grapefruit trees. The hurricane damaged several factories and oil rigs in the region.[16] Damage throughout the territory totaled $60 million (1961 USD),[3] and a total of 307 deaths were reported;[17] more than 100 of the fatalities were in Belize City,[2] including 36 who evacuated to a British administration building that was later destroyed in the storm.[18] The government of British Honduras considered Hurricane Hattie more damaging than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000 people; the lower death toll of Hattie was due to advance warning.[3]"

        "content": "After Hattie struck, officials in Belize City declared martial law.[9] A manager of United Press International described Belize City as \"nothing but a huge pile of matchsticks,\"[9] and many roads were either flooded for days or covered with mud.[19] Doctors provided typhoid vaccinations to 12,000 residents in two days to prevent the spread of the disease. Due to the high death toll, officials ordered mass cremations to stop additional disease from spreading.[20] At the city's police station, workers provided fresh water and rice to storm victims.[9] Many residents throughout British Honduras donated supplies to the storm victims, such that an airlines manager described it as \"taxing\u00a0... manpower and facilities.\" One airline allowed donations to be flown to Belize City at no cost.[16] The city's three newspapers were unable to operate due to lack of power after the storm.[16] By November\u00a05, Belize City's post office reopened on a limited basis, and all business initially remained closed. About 4,000 homeless residents from Stann Creek were moved by boat to the northern portion of the territory.[18] Many homeless people from the Belize City area set up a tent city on bushland about 16\u00a0mi (26\u00a0km) inland, which was initially intended to be temporary.[18][21] In December 1961, barracks were erected near a Red Cross Hospital to house the homeless in the camp. The site was named Hattieville and became a proper city, with utilities installed in the subsequent decade.[21] About 200 British soldiers arrived from Jamaica to quell looting and maintain order.[18][20] At least 20 people were arrested in the day after Hattie struck.[15] The British government sent flights of aid to the territory containing food, clothing, and medical supplies.[9] The House of Commons quickly passed a bill to provide \u00a310,000 in aid. The Save the Children fund sent \u00a31,000 to British Honduras,[22] and the Mexican government sent three flights with food and medicine to the territory.[9] Two American destroyers arrived in the country by November\u00a02, reporting the need for assistance.[9] The USS Antietam remained at port for weeks after the storm with six medical officers and six Marine helicopters. Four other ships sailed to the territory to provide 458,000 pounds (208,000\u00a0kg) of food.[20][23] The United States government allocated about $300,000 in assistance through the International Development Association.[22] The Canadian government provided C$75,000 worth of aid, including food, blankets, and medical supplies.[24] In 1962, Jimmy Cliff released his breakthrough single, \"Hurricane Hattie\".[25][26] By Hattie's one year anniversary, private and public workers repaired and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm. New hotels were constructed, and many stores were reopened. Prime Minister George Cadle Price successfully appealed for assistance from the British government, which ultimately provided \u00a320 million in loans.[27] In the days after the storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of British Honduras farther inland on higher ground. Work on the new capital, Belmopan, was completed in 1970.[8][28] On the 44th anniversary of the hurricane in 2005, the government of Belize unveiled a monument in Belize City to recognize the victims of the hurricane.[29] Due to the destruction and loss of life attributed to the hurricane, the name Hattie was retired by the weather Bureau following the season, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane.[30] The name was replaced with Holly for the 1965 season.[31]"

        "content": " Response\u00a0\u2022 Humanitarian response Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy, also known as Severe Tropical Cyclone Freddy, was an exceptionally long-lived, powerful, and deadly tropical cyclone that traversed the southern Indian Ocean for more than five weeks in February and March 2023.[1] Freddy was the longest-lasting tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide, and produced the most accumulated cyclone energy\u2014a metric used to measure the total energy generated by tropical cyclones\u2014of any individual cyclone on record globally.[2] Additionally, it is the third-deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, only behind 2019's Cyclone Idai and the 1973 Flores cyclone.[3] Freddy originated from a tropical low that was located south of the Indonesian archipelago on 4 February 2023.[4]  As it traveled westward across the Indian Ocean, the storm quickly intensified, becoming a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale.[4] Freddy moved into the South-West Indian Ocean, where it reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph)  and a central atmospheric pressure of 927\u00a0hPa (27.37\u00a0inHg), making it a very intense tropical cyclone.[5] Meanwhile, 1-minute sustained winds reached  270\u00a0km/h (165\u00a0mph), corresponding to Category 5-equivalent intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[6] After reaching its peak intensity, the cyclone moved toward the northern Mascarene Islands and made landfall near Mananjary, Madagascar on 21 February. It weakened further across Madagascar but regained strength upon reaching the Mozambique Channel, where it intensified and made its second landfall near Vilankulos, Mozambique on 24 February.[5] After moving across Mozambique, the cyclone endured and re-entered the channel on 1 March. It then regained its tropical characteristics and started moving along the coast of Madagascar. Freddy intensified again before making its final landfall near Quelimane, Mozambique on 11 March. It then rapidly weakened as it moved inland and dissipated by 14 March.[5] Preparations for the storm in the Mascarene Islands included flight groundings, cyclone alerts, and personnel being prepped for the aftermath, among other things. In Madagascar, areas previously affected by Cyclones Batsirai and Cheneso were feared to be worsened by the storm's arrival. Impacts in Mozambique were more severe than in Madagascar and included heavy rainfall in the southern half of the country and widely damaged infrastructure. Effects in Mozambique were exacerbated after its second landfall with further floods and wind damage. The hardest-hit was Malawi where incessant rains caused catastrophic flash floods, especially Blantyre. The nation's power grid was crippled, with its hydroelectric dam rendered inoperable. Overall, the cyclone resulted in at least 1,434 fatalities, 2,004 injuries, 19 people missing, and caused approximately US$481 million in damage.[4] Consequently, due to the extensive damage and loss of life, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has retired the name Freddy from the Australian rotating naming lists, and a replacement name has yet to be announced.[7][8]"

        "content": "The origins  of Cyclone Freddy can be traced back to 4 February 2023, when the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Low 13U had formed during an active phase of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation in conjunction with an equatorial Rossby wave,[4] while it was situated to the south of the Indonesian archipelago.[4][9] The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing warnings on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 11S early on 6 February.[10] Later, however, pronounced deep convection around the circulation, prompting the BoM to upgrade the tropical low to Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale by 12:00 UTC, and it was assigned it the name Freddy.[11] Freddy then rapidly intensified and developed an eye feature on microwave imagery, leading the JTWC to classify it as having near-equivalent intensity around 15:00 UTC on 7 February.[12] The system became increasingly susceptible to wind shear and dry air intrusion,[13] causing Freddy to weaken back into a minimal tropical storm on 9 February.[14] The cyclone quickly restrengthened with the storm becoming a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone\u2014and at 18:00 UTC on 11 February, the cyclone reached as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone in the Australian basin.[15] On 14 February, the system tracked over the 90th meridian east and into the South-West Indian Ocean cyclone region, and hence responsibility for the storm transitioned to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR) at La R\u00e9union.[16] On 15 February, the system reached Category 5-equivalent intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, with 1-minute sustained winds of 270\u00a0km/h (165\u00a0mph).[6] On 19 February, the MFR upgraded Freddy to a very intense tropical cyclone based on a Dvorak technique rating of T7.0, with 10-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) and an estimated barometric pressure of 931\u00a0hPa (27.49\u00a0inHg).[17] In post-analysis, the MFR concluded a peak wind speed of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), and minimum central pressure of 927\u00a0hPa (27.37\u00a0inHg).[5] The cyclone's eye pattern quickly deteriorated while it was traversing north of the Mascarene Islands.[18] It then developed a pinhole eye while approaching Madagascar as a compact tropical cyclone.[19] Freddy made landfall as a strong Category 2-equivalent intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) near Mananjary, Madagascar on 21 February.[20] This made Freddy the strongest storm to impact the island nation since Cyclone Batsirai a year earlier.[21] After crossing Madagascar, its circulation became exposed, and the deep convection was stripped away from the center.[22] Freddy emerged into the Mozambique Channel,[23] quickly re-intensifying into a severe tropical storm on 23 February.[24] Freddy reached Mozambique south of Vilankulos on 24 February, bringing winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph), which was just shy of severe tropical storm intensity,[25] before moving into Zimbabwe late on 26 February, where it remained for a couple of days.[26] Freddy entered the channel early on 1 March and continued to intensify, reaching tropical cyclone status as it accelerated eastward towards the coast of Madagascar on 5 March,[27] but then weakened to just below minimal tropical storm strength due to increased wind shear and dry air intrusion.[28] Freddy rapidly intensified once more and made its final landfall near Quelimane, Mozambique, with the JTWC estimated winds of about 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) on 11 March;[29] however, the storm's circulation dissipated shortly thereafter, marking the end of Freddy's time as a tropical cyclone on 14 March.[5]"

Call centers were staffed with 60 additional workers. The company also prepped 50 vehicles, electrical equipment, 15 generators, and 4 helicopters for use.[41] Residents in areas hard-hit by Cyclone Batsirai in February\u00a02022 worried of exacerbated damage upon Freddy's arrival.[42] Authorities in Le Tampon were mobilizing for the system's arrival.[43] High seas prompted the closure of the Nouvelle route du Littoral with bus shuttles established to transport residents through inland routes to and from communities in the north and west.[44][45] On 20 February, the RSMA-R mobilized 250 personnel for relief efforts.[46] All service at Roland Garros Airport was suspended the same day, with service to resume following the cyclone's passage.[47] A red alert for coastal flooding was issued for areas between Champs Borne and Pointe des Cascades.[48] The city of Saint-Beno\u00eet opened two public shelters and closed all sporting facilities.[49] Officials in Saint-Pierre postponed a local carnival for more than two weeks.[50]"

Locals said localized flooding was an issue even before landfall.[122] In a preliminary satellite evaluation of 24,000\u00a0km2 (9,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land, 900\u00a0km2 (350\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) was estimated to be flooded.[123] Widespread areas received over 500\u20131,000\u00a0mm (20\u201339\u00a0in) of rainfall, with smaller, localized pockets of 1,000\u20131,500\u00a0mm (39\u201359\u00a0in),[124] eclipsing the maximum accumulations of Cyclone Idai 4 years earlier. 348,000 hectares of cropland were damaged, and over 800,000 people were living in flooded areas following Freddy. Cholera cases also increased among affected populations. A total of 8 provinces were damaged by the cyclone. 1,017 schools took a hit, and more than 5,000\u00a0km (3,100\u00a0mi) of road was damaged. This includes the main national road, N1, which was restored by 21 March. A total of 103,000 houses were destroyed, and another 25,000 had been flooded. Some 15,000 people were stranded when they moved to higher ground for protection.[125] The old provincial hospital in Quelimane had its roof blown off, making supporting those in need more difficult. Many people were left homeless during the storm and took shelter in schools, the latter being turned into reception areas. Large amounts of crop fields were flooded as well.[126] The INGD stated that the storm's effects on Mozambique were worse than expected. Freddy affected areas were initially deemed safe beforehand.[115] Overall, Freddy caused at least 143 deaths on its second arrival. At least 886,487 people were affected as well. An estimated 49,000 were displaced and another 280 were injured.[127][128] At least 22 deaths from cholera were blamed on Freddy and the subsequent flooding.[79]"

Freddy's effects increased fears among the public that it would worsen.[129] Rainfall was heaviest in the southern region of the country.[130] These districts include Blantyre, Phalombe, Mulanje, Chikhwawa, and Nsanje.[131] Flash floods devastated many regions, washing away homes and people and leaving infrastructure ruined.[132] The entire nation experienced blackout due to the Electricity Generation Company Malawi Limited (EGENCO) shutting down power to avoid further damage to power-generating machines.[122] The nation's hydroelectric power plant, which provides a large portion of the country with electricity, was rendered inoperable by debris.[132] At least 1,216 people were killed in the onslaught of Freddy with 1,332 injuries reported.[133][134][71] At least 192 of these deaths were reported in Blantyre, and at least 40 of whom were children according to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. 135 of them were in Mulanje as well.[135] 180,000 people were displaced across the country and forced to evacuate their homes,[136] with 500,000 affected in general. Among these 280,000 were children.[74][137] There were also around 90 fatalities in Mulanje.[136] More than 50,000 houses were damaged or destroyed.[138] In terms of rainfall, over a month's worth of rain was dumped in just a day,[139] totaling to six months of precipitation in six days.[138] The small village of Mtauchira in Chiradzulu District was completely destroyed by a landslide that fell from Chambe Peak.[140] Over 430\u00a0km2 (170\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of general land was flooded, causing many smallholder farmers to have their crops and fields lost to the storm. Approximately 204,833 hectares of cropland were inundated - 84,930 being submerged and 119,930 were washed away. The storm struck just as farmers were about to harvest, compounding to local food insecurities in the nation. Farms were also damaged and many were destroyed. Livestock was severely impacted, with 194,500 dying and a further 91,000 being injured.[141][142] Notable rainfall recordings include a record-setting 458\u00a0mm (18.0\u00a0in) in 24 hours in Phalombe District. Several other districts also reported 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) in the same time range.[139][143][138] Flood waters rose in some areas days after Freddy died, with an analyzed area of 5,000\u00a0km2 (1,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) increasing by 60\u00a0km2 (23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) between 14 and 17 March. Houses whose foundations were weakened by the system also collapsed in Mangochi District.[137] Dozens of houses were reported being washed away in floodwaters in Chilobwe. Schools in ten southern regions were ordered to be closed until 15 March.[115] Heavy rains also were reported in Salima and Lilongwe.[122] Malawian president Lazarus Chakwera declared a state of disaster in the southern regions.[115] Victims were thought to be buried under rubble and debris.[144] During Freddy's extended stay in the country, visibility remained at near-zero levels. Several roads and bridges were cut, and many areas were cut off.[145] Landslides across Chiradzulu Mountain blocked roadways, leaving Chiradzulu Boma inaccessible.[140] It was stated that 14[146] districts suffered impacts from Freddy, equating to over half the country. Chakwera also said that 36 roads were broken, nine bridges washed away, and there were still many villages inaccessible by 20 March.[147]"

The WFP also provided 7-day rations of food through cash-based transfers for 17,545 people.[80] Mozambican president, Filipe Nyusi, appealed for aid and to rebuild infrastructure.[157] He also provided MT250\u00a0million ($3.9\u00a0million) to Zambezia province to help restore everyday activities.[158] The WFP requires $26.7 million to assist 541,000 people impacted by Cyclone Freddy.[159] As a result of flooding caused by the storm as well as the cutoff of access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services, cholera cases began to rapidly increase. At least 36 districts spanning 8 provinces are having outbreaks; the Inhambane and Zambezia provinces, which were heavily affected by Freddy, have declared outbreaks of cholera.[160] The cumulative figure for the cases by 21 March stood at 11,158 across the provinces, and other waterborne illnesses such as diarrhea and malaria were of risk. The INGD did not have food and supplies for immediate response, significantly slowing emergency aid.[128] As the nation tries to contain a rapidly spreading outbreak, Mozambique has requested an additional 2 million doses of a cholera vaccine from the World Health Organization.[161]"

Relief items placed before the storm were used to support families.[162] Rescue teams were sent in Chilobwe, Machinjiri and Ndirande residential areas in Blantyre. Malawian citizens pooled resources to help displaced victims in Blantyre residential areas.[122] Amnesty International suggested that Malawi be compensated for impacts by Freddy, due to being least responsible for climate change as well.[156] Government-led search-and-rescue operations consisting of the Red Cross, local military, and police also commenced following the storm. On 16 March alone, 442 people were rescued. Sniffer dogs were also used for such operations, as many people were trapped under rubble and mud. Several areas were still rendered inaccessible days after Freddy dissipated.[163][164] Millions of children were at risk of an increase in cholera cases as well. Due to cholera being transmitted through contaminated water and food, Freddy's flooding rose worries of the disease spreading greatly.[165] Chakwera also invited the country's former presidents to a caucus to discuss methods and strategies to respond to the cyclone.[166] It took up to a week or more for families in cut off areas to receive aid, mostly by helicopters provided by Tanzania, Zambia, and Malawi's defense force.[71] \"The destruction and suffering that I witnessed in southern Malawi is the human face of the global climate crisis.\" \u2014 Rebecca Adda-Dontoh, the United Nations Resident Coordinator for Malawi[167] Food prices jumped by over 300%, quadrupling to record heights in an already food-insecure nation. Maize prices also shot up 400% in places like Nsanje.[168] The Everlasting Life Missionary Church donated assorted clothes to survivors in Zomba. They also fed children at camps, some of whom had not eaten at all since Freddy. They also sent out basic supplies such as body lotion, soap, and others.[169] The crisis that ensued after Freddy also presented several negative mental health consequences among locals and frontline aid workers. Various protection services were interrupted (including childcare centers), and gender-based violence was highlighted as a prominent issue. Those affected also trafficked women, adolescent girls, and other children. Families were separated, leaving youth unattended and alone.[170] EGENCO resumed operations at the Nkula and Tedzani power stations on 14\u00a0March as water along the Shire River returned to safer levels.[171] Lazarus Chakwera declared a national two weeks of mourning for the victims of Freddy. The government promised $1.5\u00a0million for aid to those affected. The president surveyed the damage, calling it \"far worse than the images and footage we've seen\".[157] Malawi's president Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for foreign assistance, claiming that the country requires $700 million for reconstruction.[172] The OCHA brought vital emergency supplies to the hardest-hit regions. These included medical items, hygiene kits, and even support boats from the World Food Programme for those trapped in floodwaters and rubble. By 16 March, Nsanje had set up 24 camps to accommodate 4,502 households, with Chikwawa having 21 camps for 8,837 homes.[139] Malawian Former President Peter Mutharika has criticized the Chakwera administration of failing to evacuate people in the path of Cyclone Freddy before the disaster struck.[173]"

The fourth tropical storm and fifth tropical cyclone of the 2022\u201323 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Cheneso developed out of a zone of disturbed weather status which was first monitored at RSMC La R\u00e9union on 17 January. Despite convection wrapping into the curved band pattern, the system formed into a tropical depression on 18 January. The depression strengthened into Severe Tropical Storm Cheneso on the following day. Cheneso made landfall over northern Madagascar and weakened into an inland depression, before emerging into the Mozambique Channel. Cheneso later strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 25 January. The system continued moving southeast, before transitioning into a post\u2013tropical depression on 29 January. The National Office for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) has reported 33 deaths and 20 missing.[2] The agency reports a total 90,870 affected people, 34,100 of which were displaced.[2][3] Around 23,600 homes and 164 schools suffered damage.[4] Humanitarians and authorities also supported post\u2013storm preparation and relief efforts, as millions were expected to be impacted.

        "content": "The origin of Cheneso can be traced back to an area of persistent showers and thunderstorms south of Diego Garcia, first noted by the M\u00e9t\u00e9o\u2013France (MFR) on 10 January 2023.[6] Three days later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) had also begun monitoring the area of disturbance.[7] The system was located in a favorable environment for intensification, as well as warm sea surface temperatures, low to high vertical wind shear.[8] Despite this, the MFR initiated advisories for the zone of disturbed weather, while the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on 17 January.[9][10] Six hours later, the MFR upgraded the system to tropical disturbance status. [11] Similarly, the JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 08S.[12] Deep convection was wrapping into the curved band pattern, prompting the MFR to upgrade it to a tropical depression status.[13] At 12:00 UTC on 18 January, the MFR also upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm status, and the Meteo Madagascar named it Cheneso.[14] Soon afterward, Cheneso intensified further into a severe tropical storm status.[15] Satellite imagery showed that a central dense overcast (CDO) was obscuring the low\u2013level circulation center (LLCC).[16] Cheneso continued moving westwards, and by the next day, it had made landfall over northern Madagascar; the JTWC released its final warning on the storm.[17] By 18:00 UTC, the MFR declared that Cheneso had degenerated into an overland depression.[18] Due to uncertainty in predicting the storm's track, the MFR temporarily ceased issuing advisories on 20 January.[19] During 21 January, Cheneso began to emerge into the Mozambique Channel, the JTWC resumed monitoring and stated the system had the potential to re\u2013develop.[20][21] The LLCC started to get consolidated with deep convective bands wrapping into it.[22] As a result, the MFR initiated advisories again on 23 January.[23] Cheneso gained tropical disturbance status yet again, however the system lacked deep convection near its center.[24] By 14:00 UTC that day, the JTWC re\u2013issued a TCFA, and re\u2013upgraded the system to a tropical storm.[25][26] Cheneso resumed its organizing trend soon afterward, and at 00:00 UTC on 24 January, the MFR upgraded the system to a tropical depression status.[27] Six hours later, convection increased near the center, and the storm was upgraded to moderate tropical storm status.[28] The storm continued to organize with an intense CDO forming along with an eye, and Cheneso strengthened to severe tropical storm status.[29][30] By 03:00 UTC on 25 January, Cheneso strengthened into a Category 1\u2013equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), as it neared the coast of Madagascar.[31] The cyclone strengthened further with a defined curved pattern, marking its intensification into a tropical cyclone status.[32] By 18:00 UTC, the eye pattern consolidated as the cyclone moved northeast after being stationary for the past 6 hours.[33] Satellite imagery depicted that a tightly\u2013wrapped convective banding was circulating around a cloud\u2013filled eye.[34] Cheneso started to rapidly weaken after its eye quickly collapsed and the cloud tops had warmed.[35] By 12:00 UTC on 26 January, Cheneso was downgraded to severe tropical storm status by the MFR, as it headed in a southeast direction.[36] By the next day, Cheneso was downgraded to tropical storm status by the JTWC as its LLCC and its surrounding convection became a fragmented cold band.[37] But, Cheneso's cloud pattern continued to improve with its CDO, and Cheneso re\u2013intensified, reaching 10\u2013minute maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), 1\u2013minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) around 00:00 UTC on 28 January.[38][39]  A Radarsat\u20132 SAR image recorded winds of 80\u201385\u00a0km/h (50\u201353\u00a0mph) around the swath.[40] At 03:00 UTC on 28 January, the JTWC estimated that Cheneso had strengthened into a Category 2\u2013equivalent tropical cyclone, with 1\u2013minute sustained winds at 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[40] Cheneso weakened into a severe tropical storm status, after the convection began to rapidly deteriorate.[41] The JTWC also reported that Cheneso had weakened further into a tropical storm status.[42] By 06:00 UTC on 29 January, Cheneso's structure became poorly organized, prompting MFR to reclassify the storm as a post\u2013tropical depression.[43]  The JTWC also discontinued warnings on the system around 03:00 UTC on 30 January.[44] The system was last noted on 1 February.[45]"

It officially began on 15 November 2022, and ended on 30 April 2023, with the exception for Mauritius and the Seychelles, for which it ended on 15 May 2023. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of 90\u00b0E and south of the Equator. However, tropical cyclones can form year-round, and all tropical cyclones that form between 1 July 2022 and 30 June 2023 will be part of the season. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in R\u00e9union and unofficially by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The season was average in terms of the number of systems that formed, with nine systems becoming at least moderate tropical storms, and six reaching tropical cyclone strength. Activity began early, with the first two systems (Ashley and Balita) developing in September and October, and ended late with Fabien in May. The season featured Cyclone Freddy, which became the longest-lived tropical cyclone on record, beating the previous record of Hurricane John in 1994, and also had the highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of any tropical cyclone on record worldwide, surpassing Hurricane Ioke in 2006. In addition, Freddy is the only known tropical cyclone to achieve seven separate rapid intensification cycles. Additionally, Freddy was the second farthest-traveling tropical cyclone ever observed worldwide, only with 1994's John's. The most intense system of the season was Cyclone Darian. In the month of January, Cyclone Cheneso brought flooding and strong winds to Madagascar. In May, Cyclone Fabien formed close to the equator and became the latest intense tropical cyclone in the satellite era, surpassing Cyclone Billy-Lila of 1986 by six days. Tropical cyclones during this season collectively caused at least 1,483 deaths and more than $501 million in damage."

It was last noted as a subtropical depression on 29 January. In February 2023, Tropical Low 11U from the Australian region moved into this basin, where it was classified as Moderate Tropical Storm Dingani. Although initially struggling to intensify due to wind shear, it gradually intensified and eventually reached tropical cyclone status, before moving southwestwards and dissipated. Cyclone Freddy moved the Australian area and reached this region, where MFR immediately classed it as a tropical cyclone status. It subsequently strengthened into a very intense tropical cyclone status. Freddy later intensified into a Category 5 tropical cyclone before making landfall over Madagascar. It weakened as it crossed the Mozambique Channel, but it re-intensified to severe tropical storm status before making landfall in Mozambique, it unexpectedly reappeared in the Mozambique Channel. It was upgraded to tropical cyclone status. It weakened but began to re-strengthen when it approached Mozambique, the storm gradually deteriorated and last noted on 14 March. Another tropical depression formed and  strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Enala, which subsequently evolved into a tropical cyclone and last occurred on 28 February. Another period of inactivity then ensued, until a Moderate Tropical Storm 09 formed and dissipated quickly. In May, Fabien formed close to the equator and became an intense tropical cyclone, which was unusually strong this late in the season before encountering increasing wind shear. The ACE index for the 2022\u201323 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season as calculated by Colorado State University was 197.7 units."

The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center (Mauritius Meteorological Services) in Mauritius names a storm if it intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 55\u00b0E and 90\u00b0E. If instead a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 30\u00b0E and 55\u00b0E then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center (Meteo Madagascar) in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. Storm names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with any names that have been used automatically removed. Therefore, all storm names used this year will be removed from the rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2025\u201326 season, while the unused names will remain on the list.[157] New names this season are: Ashley, Balita, Cheneso, Dingani, Enala, Fabien, Gezani, Horacio, Indusa and Juluka.

The wave became a tropical depression again late on August\u00a015 while approaching Cuba. Dennis reintensified into a tropical storm before landfall in Matanzas Province. The cyclone emerged into the Straits of Florida on August\u00a016, before striking the Florida Keys and then mainland Monroe County early the next day. It drifted across Florida, reaching the Atlantic near Cape Canaveral on August\u00a019. Dennis continued to intensify and made landfall near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, but moved east-northeastward and soon tracked offshore. Late on August\u00a020, Dennis deepened into a hurricane with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), before weakening to a tropical storm over colder waters on August\u00a021. Dennis became extratropical northeast of Bermuda early on August\u00a022 and persisted until being absorbed by a frontal system on August\u00a026. In the Caribbean, Dennis dropped heavy rainfall on some islands, including Martinique, Saint Lucia, Virgin Islands, and the Greater Antilles. Flooding in Jamaica left at least 50\u00a0people homeless. In Florida, heavy rain fell in many areas to the east of the storm's path. Much of southeast Florida received at least 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of precipitation, while over 25.56\u00a0in (649\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Homestead. Nearly all of Miami-Dade County was flooded to the south of Kendall Drive. Many businesses and homes in cities such as Homestead and Florida City suffered water damage. However, the worst damage was incurred to crops, which experienced a loss of over $17.26\u00a0million (1981\u00a0USD).[nb 1] One death and nearly $18.5\u00a0million in damage occurred in Florida. Further north, Dennis also caused flooding in the Carolinas, inundating many streets and causing crop damage in both states. A weather-related traffic accident in South Carolina resulted in two fatalities. Twenty families in Columbus County, North Carolina evacuated after the Waccamaw River overran its banks. Overall, Dennis left caused three deaths and about $28.5\u00a0million in damage."

        "content": "Satellite imagery indicated that a well-organized tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August\u00a05. The wave headed westward and organized further,[1] developing into a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07 while situated about 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.[2] Early on August\u00a08, satellite imagery indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dennis.[3] The cyclone strengthened slightly further, reaching winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h);[2] wind shear prevented additional deepening and eventually caused Dennis to weaken to a tropical depression while approaching the Lesser Antilles on August\u00a011[3] Early on August\u00a012, the system crossed through the Windward Islands with a poorly-defined circulation, making landfall in or passing close to Martinique. Dennis continued weakening after entering the Caribbean Sea,[2] degenerating back into a tropical wave at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a013 while located about 170\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) south of Dominican Republic.[1][2] The remnant tropical wave gradually curved northwestward and brushed western Jamaica on August\u00a014. As the wave approached the south coast of central Cuba,[2] it rapidly re-organized into a tropical cyclone,[3] becoming a tropical depression again at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015. Around 00:00\u00a0UTC the following day, the depression re-intensified into a tropical storm and made landfall in Cuba near Playa Gir\u00f3n in Matanzas Province. Dennis moved northward across the island and emerged into the Straits of Florida near C\u00e1rdenas shortly after 06:00\u00a0UTC.[2] While crossing the Straits of Florida, deep convection associated with the cyclone attempted to become concentrated near the center and develop an eyewall. However, interaction with a trough prevented Dennis from intensifying despite passing over warm sea surface temperatures. The storm decelerated while approaching Florida due to weak steering currents.[3] Late on August\u00a016, Dennis moved across the middle Florida Keys as a minimal tropical storm. Between 06:00\u00a0UTC and 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017, Dennis made landfall in rural mainland Monroe County with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). The cyclone moved slowly north-northeastward across Florida until emerging into the Atlantic just north of Cape Canaveral early on August\u00a019. Dennis continued to deepen while moving offshore the Southeastern United States. The storm curved northeastward and made landfall near Emerald Isle, North Carolina,\nwith winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). Dennis then accelerated east-northeastward and soon re-emerged into the Atlantic from Hatteras Island.[2] Later on August\u00a020, a reconnaissance aircraft flight observed sustained winds of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg) \u2013 the lowest pressure associated with the storm. On this basis,[1] Dennis was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on Saffir\u2013Simpson scale at 18:00\u00a0UTC. The hurricane intensified slightly further, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021.[2] However, Dennis soon entered a region of increasingly colder sea surface temperatures,[1] weakening into a tropical storm about six hours later.[2] The system also began losing tropical characteristics, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone about 425\u00a0mi (685\u00a0km) south of Sable Island at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022.[1][2] After Dennis became extratropical, the ship Carista Express observed sustained winds of 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h). The remnants turned northward on August\u00a024 and began weakening. By August\u00a026, the extratropical storm was absorbed by a frontal system.[4]"

        "header": "Preparations and impact",
        "content": "Dennis passed through the Caribbean Sea as a tropical depression and during its tropical wave stage, limiting impacts to heavy rainfall on Martinique, Saint Lucia, the Virgin Islands, Hispaniola,[5] and the Greater Antilles. In Jamaica, portions of the island received about 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of precipitation. The resultant flooding forced the evacuation of dozens of residents and left at least 50\u00a0people homeless.[6] As Dennis approached the Florida Keys, several gale warnings were issued, with the first from Long Key to Dry Tortugas at 04:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016. These gale warnings were posted progressively farther north along the East Coast of the United States, reaching as far north as Windmill Point in Virginia. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued in South Florida from Fort Myers to Palm Beach, including the Florida Keys.[7] Hundreds of people were evacuated from the campgrounds of Bahia Honda and John Pennekamp state parks. Shelters were also prepared to open in the Florida Keys if necessary.[8] Typically, when a tropical cyclone approaches South Florida, the South Florida Water Management District drains Lake Okeechobee using the floodgates. However, due to a severe drought, water was instead directed into the lake from the connector canals.[9] The storm resulted in a postponement of a second spraying to combat the spread of Mediterranean fruit flies in the Tampa Bay Area.[10] About 40,000\u00a0tourists fled Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, including about 500\u00a0people from a campground, causing a loss of about $2\u00a0million to tourism.[11] Some United States Military vessels were sent out to sea,[12] while about 70\u00a0A-10 jets at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base were flown to England Air Force Base near Alexandria, Louisiana.[13] Rainfall totals in South Florida were generally between 5 and 10\u00a0in (130 and 250\u00a0mm). However, little precipitation fell in Lake Okeechobee.[14] Rainfall amounts in portions of southern Miami-Dade County ranged from 20 to 25\u00a0in (510 to 640\u00a0mm), with a peak total of 25.56\u00a0in (649\u00a0mm) in Homestead.[15] An aerial survey of Miami-Dade County indicated that an approximately 100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (260\u00a0km2) area from the eastern edge of the Everglades from just south of Miami to the southern tip of Florida was flooded with 6 to 24\u00a0in (150 to 610\u00a0mm) of water \u2013 described as a \"solid sheet of water from Kendall Drive all the way south\" \u2013 while Homestead and West Kendall were inundated with water about 5.5\u00a0ft (1.7\u00a0m) in depth. At a trailer park in Homestead, water approached the doors of the mobile homes.[16] A number of other homes in Homestead and Florida City were flooded. Many businesses in downtown Homestead closed after water began entering the buildings, with some store owners placing sandbags in front of their business. Dozens of cars were abandoned as roads began to flood.[16] News reports noted that homes resembled islands, while roads were reduced to \"an impassable goo.\"[17] Flooding at Homestead Air Force Base forced officials to evacuate 86\u00a0aircraft.[18] There were major losses to commercial and residential buildings due to roof failures caused by Dennis.[14] Damage to private property was estimated at slightly more than $983,000. Heavier losses was sustained to the agriculture of Florida due to slow draining water in some areas. Fruit and vegetable crops suffered just over $17.26\u00a0million in damage. Tropical vegetables and avocados in particular experienced extensive losses. Damage to the former reached about $5.1\u00a0million, with production losses occurring to 4,500 acres (1,800\u00a0ha) of calabaza, cassava, eddoe, and sweet potatoes. Approximately 650 acres (260\u00a0ha) of avocado trees were destroyed, causing a loss of more than 100,000\u00a0boxes, with the fruit suffering over $3.5\u00a0million in damage.[19] The standing water also caused health issues for local residents, including septic tanks contaminating water wells. The storm spawned two tornadoes, one on Plantation Key and the other in northern Miami-Dade County, though both resulted in only minor damage.[14] Approximately 122,500\u00a0businesses and homes in Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties were left without electricity, while more than 8,000\u00a0people lost telephone service \u2013 mostly in southern Miami-Dade County. Restoration of telephone services took over a week, with the telephone company suffering about $500,000 in damage.[18] One death occurred in the area after a man attempted to drive in high water, but his car swerved and crashed into a palm tree.[20] Overall, Dennis left nearly $18.5\u00a0million in damage in Florida.[19] In response to the flooding, Governor of Florida Bob Graham signed an executive order authorizing 10\u00a0high-axle combat vehicles and 20\u00a0National Guardsmen to assist in the evacuation of residents south of Miami. At least 25\u00a0households were rescued, while dozens of other families left before becoming stranded, some of them by canoe. Three evacuation shelters were opened for those displaced from their homes.[16] On September\u00a024, over a month after Dennis dropped heavy rainfall in far southeastern Florida, Governor Graham issued a disaster declaration for a 7.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km2) area just outside the eastern Everglades, where standing water remained.[14] The storm also brought heavy rainfall to states farther north, such as South Carolina and North Carolina, where similar, but less extensive losses to agriculture occurred.[14] In the former, areas from north of Charleston to northeast Horry County observed 5 to 10\u00a0in (130 to 250\u00a0mm) of precipitation in a 24-hour period.[18] The Waccamaw River reached its highest level since 1945.[14] In downtown Charleston, several streets were flooded, forcing residents to park their cars on higher ground several blocks away.[12]  Two deaths occurred in North Charleston as a result of a traffic accident.[11] Much of southeastern North Carolina observed at least 5 to 7\u00a0in (130 to 180\u00a0mm) of precipitation,[15] with a peak of 10.65\u00a0in (271\u00a0mm) of rainfall to the north of Wilmington.[21] Many creeks and streams in that portion of the state swelled significantly. At Pireway, an unincorporated community in Columbus County, about 20\u00a0families evacuated after the Waccamaw River exceed its banks. Flooding caused about $10\u00a0million in damage to crops in the county. Inundation by water caused several roads to close in New Hanover, Pamlico, and Pender counties. Along the coasts of North Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware, gusty winds and abnormally high tides left generally minor erosion and coastal flooding,[18] though some homes were damaged at Willoughby Spit in Norfolk, Virginia.[14] About 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) to the northeast of Virginia Beach, Virginia, a husband and wife on a 34\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) schooner became caught in 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) waves, though they were both rescued by the Coast Guard.[22]"

        "content": " Tropical Depression Eight caused severe flooding in southeastern Texas in late August 1981. The twelfth tropical cyclone of the annual hurricane season, the depression developed from a tropical disturbance over the Bay of Campeche on August\u00a026. Moving northwestward, the cyclone failed to intensify into a tropical storm before making landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas to the north of Tampico on August\u00a028, with winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h). After moving inland, the depression curved north-northwestward before degenerating into a surface low pressure area near the Mexico\u2013United States border on August\u00a029. The remnants moved eastward across Texas and entered Louisiana before dissipating on September\u00a01. Although the system was only a surface low upon reaching Texas, a large thunderstorm complex developed near its center on August\u00a029. This resulted in heavy rainfall across southeastern Texas, with a peak total of 21\u00a0in (530\u00a0mm) in Pine Springs, with much of that falling in only about six hours. One of the hardest hit areas was Lavaca County. At least 15\u00a0streets in downtown Hallettsville were flooded, damaging hundreds of cars, 150 to 200\u00a0homes, 75\u00a0businesses, and a few local government buildings. Five people were killed by floodwaters in Shiner. Throughout Lavaca County, more than 286\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed, 17\u00a0bridges and several roads were washed out, and hundreds of head of cattle were drowned. The depression spawned 14\u00a0tornadoes, one of which caused extensive damage in the Galveston area. Overall, the depression left five fatalities and more than $56.2\u00a0million (1981\u00a0USD) in damage.[nb 1]"

        "content": "In late August, a tropical disturbance, which was a portion of the same system that spawned Tropical Storm Irwin in the Pacific Ocean, reached the Bay of Campeche. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km) west of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The cyclone moved northwestward and strengthened slightly to peak with maximum sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,004\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg) at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027.[1] The National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Eight until 22:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, after satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the system was a tropical depression.[2] Shortly after 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, the depression made landfall in Tamaulipas about 45\u00a0mi (70\u00a0km) north of Tampico. About six hours later,[1] the cyclone degenerated into a weak surface low pressure area just south of the Rio Grande.[3] The low entered Texas on August\u00a030 and moved northeastward and then east-northeastward due to an upper-level trough.[4] While crossing the far eastern side of the state, the remnant low resumed its northeastward motion before entering Louisiana and dissipating on September\u00a01.[3]"

        "header": "Impact",
        "content": "The depression spawned 14\u00a0tornadoes in Texas, most of which caused little to no damage. In Aransas Pass, a waterspout spawned over Redfish Bay moved ashore and destroyed a mobile home, deroofed a fishing lodge, and toppled electrical poles and power lines before lifting. In Live Oak County near Three Rivers, a tornado crossed a uranium mining business headquarters, extensively damaging a warehouse and an office. A few people received minor injuries. In a rural area of Bee County, a tornado demolished a mobile homes and a barn, unroofed another home, and downed several electrical poles. A tornado in Galveston shattered several windows, damaged some planes, and deroofed a few hangars at the Scholes International Airport, where the tornado produced a wind gust of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h). The twister also severed a major power line; extensively damaged a fire station and a warehouse; and damaged or deroofed several homes and buildings, including at the Strand Historic District. Before lifting, the tornado tossed several 18-wheel trucks and damaged a pier at the Port of Galveston after a 450\u00a0ft (140\u00a0m) freighter broke loose.[4] After entering Texas, a large thunderstorm complex developed near the center of the system on August\u00a029. As a result, heavy rainfall fell in a roughly 50 by 200\u00a0mi (80 by 322\u00a0km) area between Seguin and Houston. In Fayette County, 21\u00a0in (530\u00a0mm) of precipitation was recorded \u2013 the highest rainfall total from the depression \u2013 much of it falling in only about six hours.[4] At LaGrange, \"a sudden flood wave\" caused the Colorado River to rise 5.5\u00a0ft (1.7\u00a0m) above flood stage. Some homes in the town received water damage after a creek overflowed. In Flatonia, residents evacuated as waters began rising. Eventually, the town became isolated after creeks swelled, while around a dozen homes were flooded. Interstate 10 was inundated in the town. Throughout the county, six bridges were washed away and several others were damaged. Several hundred heads of livestock drowned. Preliminary estimates place at damage toll in Fayette County at $2.7\u00a0million, with $1.5\u00a0million for property and $1.2\u00a0million incurred to agriculture.[4] In Starr County, 4.7\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell in only about 90\u00a0minutes. Several low-lying streets were inundated by water, damaging dozens of vehicles. Some residents evacuated as water began entering homes. Rainfall in Brooks County peaked at 7.67\u00a0in (195\u00a0mm) in Falfurrias. The lowest-lying portions of the town were flooded after the Cibolo Creek swelled its bank, with water entering homes and businesses. Crops such as melons and vegetables were damaged. Between 4 and 6.5\u00a0in (100 and 170\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell overnight in Goliad County on August\u00a030, flooding some farmlands after small creeks overflowed. In Karnes County, 16.29\u00a0in (414\u00a0mm) of rain fell at a weather station located 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) south of Karnes City. Flooding in the town was mainly confined to damaged cars and roads as the community was situated at a higher elevation than surrounding areas. Kenedy suffered extensive damage after water surged down the Escondido Creek,\ncausing approximately 300\u00a0people to evacuate. About 70\u00a0homes, 12\u00a0mobile homes, and a number of businesses and cars were damaged. In the rural areas of the county, at least 200\u00a0heads of cattle were killed. Damage reached approximately $5\u00a0million. In Bastrop and Caldwell counties, a number of farms in rural areas were flooded after several creeks and streams overflowed.[4] The community of Hochheim in DeWitt County observed around 17.5\u00a0in (440\u00a0mm) of precipitation over the course of one day, though much of it fell in four to six hours. Three people from injured near Hochheim after their car was swept off the road. The lower Guadalupe River crested at 42.3\u00a0ft (12.9\u00a0m) at Cuero, its second largest height on record. A number of residents evacuated from the city as the river began to rise. Flooding there damaged 40\u00a0homes and 4\u00a0businesses. Near Thomaston, a 72-year-old man was swept away by flood waters, but he survived and was found after four days. More than 2,000\u00a0head of cattle drowned, while crops such as hay and pecans experienced extensive losses. Damage in the county reached $2.4\u00a0million, including $1.4\u00a0million to property and $1.2\u00a0million to agriculture.[4] In Gonzales County, the town of Cheapside observed 18\u00a0in (460\u00a0mm) of rain in a 24-hour period. All creeks exceeded their banks and the Guadalupe and San Marcos rivers rose sharply; the former crested at a near-record height. Close to 200\u00a0people were rescued from their homes, vehicles, or isolated high spot. In the city of Gonzales, water from the rapidly swelling Tinsley Creek damaged approximately 30\u00a0homes and mobile homes and washed away dozens of cars. About 50\u00a0homes and mobile homes in Waelder were flooded after multiple branches the Baldrige Creek overflowed their banks. Several other dwellings in and around Leesville suffered water damage after the O'Neil Creek reached its highest level since at least 1936. Portions of several highways in the county were inundated, including U.S. routes 90 and 90A; Texas Highway 97; and Interstate 10 near Waelder. Agriculture also suffered severely, with hundreds of cattle lost. Damage in the county was estimated at over $5\u00a0million.[4] In Lavaca County, unofficial reports indicate that 19.96\u00a0in (507\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell at Dreyer in a 24-hour period. Severe flash flooding was experienced along many creeks in the northwestern side of the county. A flood wave moving down the Rock Creek caused severe damage to homes in Shiner. Three teenage boys drowned after a home was washed away and demolished. Two other deaths occurred in the city as a few cars attempted to cross the flooded U.S. Route 77A bridge. The Boggy Creek exceeded its banks, severing water and gas lines and washing away the Spoetzl Brewery bridge and nearby homes. Throughout Shiner, many cars and 118\u00a0homes were damaged, with several swept away. In Hallettsville, the Lavaca River crested at a record height of 41.2\u00a0ft (12.6\u00a0m). Fifteen streets were particularly hard hit,[4] with much of downtown being inundated by about 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) of water.[3] A total of 150 to 200\u00a0dwellings and 75\u00a0businesses were damaged, as were some local government buildings.[4] The basement of the county courthouse was inundated with 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) of water, damaging equipment and furniture, while the jail was flooded up to the second floor,[8] forcing the evacuation of prisoners.[9] City Hall also received water damage.[4] Hundreds of cars were severely damaged or completely ruined. A total of 18\u00a0homes in Moulton were damaged. Numerous roads were inundated and 17\u00a0bridges were washed away, including a bridge that was over 100\u00a0years old. Lavaca County suffered the worst impact from the storm,[4] with damage reaching approximately $35\u00a0million.[10] Portions of Fort Bend County received over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rain, particularly in Richmond, Rosenberg, and Sugar Land. Some homes in low-lying areas south of Katy were flooded. A number of motorists drove into deep ditches after the edge of the roads were obscured by water. More than 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha) of fields of harvestable cotton were inundated. In Brazoria County, the city of West Columbia observed at least 10.5\u00a0in (270\u00a0mm) of precipitation. Bayous and creeks rose throughout the county, especially in rural areas. In Alvin, streets and low-lying areas were flooded, while several businesses and homes in Angleton received water damage. Rainfall totals of 6 to 11\u00a0in (150 to 280\u00a0mm) in much of Harris County elevated a number of bayos and creeks, some of which exceeded their banks and forced the evacuation of hundreds of people.[4] The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County suspended bus service for several hours, stranding approximately 80,000\u00a0commuters. In Aldine, over 100\u00a0students were required to stay at school until water on the streets could recede, while street flooding in Houston resulted in the cancellation of classes at University of Houston and Texas Southern University.[11] Across the county, several dozen businesses, 1,250\u00a0homes, and 1,000\u00a0vehicles were damaged. Three injuries occurred after a woman and her two children were submerged by water while in a pickup truck. In Galveston County, several major streets in Galveston, Hitchcock, La Marque, and Texas City were flooded. Dozens of dwellings in low-lying areas of La Marque and Texas City received extensive water damage, including 100\u00a0in the latter. The La Marque City Hall was also damaged. In Galveston, flooding primarily affected the first floor of buildings damaged by the tornado.

The number of tropical storms and major hurricanes stood solely as record lows until tied by 2010 and 2003, respectively. Additionally, the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the season (Eastern Pacific and Central Pacific combined) as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the National Hurricane Center was 22.3 units.[nb 1][3] This ranked the season as the quietest Northeastern Pacific basin season on record.[4] The low activity seen in the East Pacific was a common occurrence around the globe in 1977, with the fewest tropical cyclones worldwide, at 69, until 2010 recorded one fewer.[5][6] May, June, July, and August all saw one named storm per month, with one hurricane each in the latter two months. September was more active with three named storms, of which one became a Category\u00a02 hurricane. The season came to an end in October with one named storm which intensified into a hurricane. Despite the record low number of tropical storms, numerous short-lived tropical depressions existed throughout the eastern Pacific in 1977; like most of the other cyclones, however, these caused little or no impact to land.[7]"

The system remained largely stationary throughout the day through 26 April. On that day, another low approached from Madhya Pradesh, and in conjunction with a ridge over China, the pressure gradient became tighter across Bangladesh. Warm, moist air flowed northeast from the Bay of Bengal while cool, dry air flowed south from the Himalayas. In the upper-levels of the atmosphere above the low, strong westerly winds from the jet stream created ample wind shear, a key factor in the development of supercell thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes. The jet stream became particularly intense on 26 April, with a sounding from Dhaka observing 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) winds at a height of 10.6\u00a0km (35,000\u00a0ft). An established dry line over western Bangladesh served as a focal point for thunderstorm development. By 12:00\u00a0UTC, all the aforementioned factors served to produce severe thunderstorms across the country.[9] Around 12:30\u00a0UTC, a tornado touched down near Daulatpur in the Manikganj District and traveled east, soon striking Saturia. It caused tremendous damage across a 150\u00a0km2 (58\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) area covering three upazilas, with Saturia being hardest-hit.[9][10] Its path was about 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) long.[11] A World Meteorological Organization news letter noted the tornado as F3 on the Fujita Scale. However, the stated wind estimate of 338 to 418\u00a0km/h (210 to 260\u00a0mph) would rank it as an F4.[9][12] According to the World Meteorological Organization in 2017, the tornado killed roughly 1,300 people and injured 12,000.[10] In 2022, this death toll was challenged in a paper authored by Dr. Fahim Sufi with the Australian Government, Dr. Edris Alam with the University of Chittagong, and Dr. Musleh Alsulami with the Umm al-Qura University, where it was stated the deadliest tornado in Bangladesh history was the 14 April 1969 Dhaka, Bangladesh tornado, which killed 922 people.[3] This new publication stills keeps a Bangladesh tornado as the deadliest in history, just not this specific tornado.[3] Damage was extensive, as countless trees were uprooted and every home within a six square kilometer area of the tornado's path was completely destroyed.[1] An article in the Bangladesh Observer stated, \"The devastation was so complete, that barring some skeletons of trees, there were no signs of standing infrastructures\".[1] Approximately 80,000 people were left homeless.[11] A second tornado struck the Narsingdi District, killing 5\u00a0people and injuring 500\u00a0others.[10]"

At this time, the JTWC reported winds of 255\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category 5 intensity on the SSHWS.[1] Subsequently, MFR remarked that the system had reached its peak wind speed of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), as an intense tropical cyclone.[3] After attaining peak intensity, MFR and the JTWC began to lower their intensity estimates as thunderstorms began to erode in the northwestern quadrant of the eyewall.[1] Moving slowly southwest, Intense Tropical Cyclone Kalunde underwent an eyewall replacement cyclone late on March\u00a09. The next day, the JTWC notes that Kalunde re-intensified somewhat; however, this is not supported by MFR\u2019s estimates. While slowly approaching the small island of Rodrigues, Kalunde was estimated (according to MFR) to have winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). On March\u00a012, Kalunde passed 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) away from Rodrigues, and around that time the JTWC reported winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). MFR downgraded Kalunde to severe tropical storm status at 0000\u00a0UTC on March\u00a014. Twelve hours later, the center of circulation became exposed from the convection. Kalunde continued trekking south-southeastward on the March\u00a015 as it underwent extratropical transition. The JTWC stopped monitoring the low at 1200\u00a0UTC while estimating winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). At 1800\u00a0UTC on March\u00a015, MFR declared the system extratropical, located approximately 690\u00a0mi (1,110\u00a0km) south-southeast of Rodrigues. The agency officially stopped tracking the system at 1200\u00a0UTC the next day[1] though the storm finally dissipated on March 17.[3]"

Many roads were washed out, isolating many communities.[7] Wind gusts estimated up to 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) destroyed the island's power and telecommunications grid, leaving the entire populace without power.[5][8] Communication lines between Rodrigues and nearby Mauritius were also cut.[9] Hospitals were also without electricity; one operation had to be done using a torch light. Because communication was lost during Kalunde's passage, residents lacked information about the storm for several hours.[7] About 80\u00a0percent of the drinking water was contaminated and food crop on the island was washed away.[8] During the storm's three-day passage of the island, 329.1\u00a0mm (12.96\u00a0in) of rain fell.[10] A total of 1,600 homes and 40 boats were damaged and losses across the island amounted to \u20ac3.4\u00a0million (US$3.15\u00a0million).[11] In the wake of the storm, the French Red Cross supplied 1.5\u00a0tons of supplies to approximately 10,000\u00a0people victims of Kalunde.[8] Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger visited the island Friday to assess the damage while another official called on Mauritius officials to contribute to a cyclone relief fund for the island group. Twenty technicians were also sent to the area in wake of the storm. Officials estimated that it would take five weeks for power to be fully restored across Rodrigues.[12] They also stated that if a similar situation took place and people were in need of emergency services, no one would be able to receive them. Furthermore, they proposed that bridges would to be built in order to forestall roads from being washed out again.[7]"

The final named storm of the 2002\u201303 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Manou formed on May\u00a02 to the southwest of Diego Garcia. It moved generally to the southwest for much of its duration, steered by a ridge to the southeast. Manou affected Saint Brandon and Mauritius with gusty winds. After an initial strengthening phase, the storm weakened but later re-intensified as it approached Madagascar. Manou developed a well-defined eye and reached peak winds only 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) from the eastern Madagascar coastline. For about 12\u00a0hours, the cyclone stalled before turning to the south and weakening. Manou became extratropical on May 10 and dissipated three days later. Damage in Madagascar was heaviest near Vatomandry, where 85% of buildings were destroyed and 23\u00a0people were killed. Manou destroyed about 24,500\u00a0houses nationwide, leaving 114,480\u00a0people homeless. The storm destroyed large areas of crops and disrupted transportation, including damaging the road between Vatomandry and Brickaville. Manou injured 85 and killed 89\u00a0people throughout Madagascar."

        "content": "In late April, an area of convection persisted southwest of Diego Garcia in the southern Indian Ocean. The system had a low-level circulation and pulsating thunderstorm activity. Located in an area of weak to moderate wind shear, the convection gradually organized while developing outflow. On May\u00a02, a secondary area of convection, also with an accompanying circulation, formed to the northwest, and also showed signs of development. That day, the original disturbance organized enough for M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR)[nb 1] to designate it Tropical Disturbance 16 at 1200\u00a0UTC. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued tropical cyclone formation alerts for both systems within a 14\u2011hour period, and upgraded the original system to Tropical Cyclone 18S on May\u00a03 about 980\u00a0km (610\u00a0mi) northeast of Mauritius. Due to the disturbance to the northwest, as well as a building ridge to the northeast, the system continued to the southwest. On May\u00a04, MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression and later Tropical Storm Manou.[2] According to the JTWC, the storm quickly reached 1-minute sustained winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph).[3] The secondary disturbance to the west weakened while approaching the storm. Manou also weakened due to ongoing shear, and the windspeeds dropped as the circulation became exposed from the convection. On May\u00a06, the storm re-intensified and the thunderstorms redeveloped while passing north of Mauritius and R\u00e9union. On May\u00a08 while approaching Madagascar, Manou developed an eye, and as a result, MFR upgraded it to tropical cyclone status, with 10-minute winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). The JTWC also upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. After becoming a tropical cyclone, Manou intensified further, although its forward motion slowed significantly. MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) on May\u00a08,[2] and JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph), with gusts to 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph).[3] This made Manou a rare May tropical cyclone in the basin; only four other storms that formed in the south-west Indian Ocean in May reached winds of over 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) since satellite coverage began, most recently Cyclone Kesiny in the previous year.[2] While maintaining its peak intensity and an eye 44\u00a0km (27\u00a0mi) in diameter, Manou reached a position only 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) from the eastern Madagascar coastline. At that time, gale-force winds extended over 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) from the center,[2] and MFR estimated a minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[4] For about 12\u00a0hours, Manou drifted off the eastern coast of Madagascar before turning to the south,[3] moving around a ridge to its east. Land interaction and drier air weakened the eye, and on May\u00a09 the cyclone weakened to tropical storm status. The next day Manou weakened to a tropical depression, and the JTWC issued its last advisory.[2] MFR continued tracking the storm until it dissipated on May\u00a013.[4]"

On Mauritius, the storm produced gusty winds across much of the island, peaking at 107\u00a0km/h (66\u00a0mph).[2] Before affecting Madagascar, officials in the country advised residents to evacuate to shelters, although the storm was not expected to be as severe as it was.[5] When Manou stalled just offshore eastern Madagascar, it produced gusts as strong as 211\u00a0km/h (131\u00a0mph) in Vatomandry. The same city reported 227\u00a0mm (8.9\u00a0in) of rainfall in a 15\u2011hour period.[2] Damage was heaviest in Vatomandry,[6] where 85% of buildings were destroyed,[7] although the broader region also experienced severe damage and was largely isolated from the rest of the country. In Vatomandry, Manou severely damaged the main hospital, several schools, and the prison. The storm disrupted power and water networks.[6] Strong winds blowing salt spray destroyed the coffee and cloves crops, and rice crops were also damaged,[8] after 80% of rice fields were flooded in Brickaville and Andevoranto. In those two towns, an official estimated that 95% of houses were wrecked.[9] The road between Vatomandry and Brickaville was washed out or otherwise blocked by landslides, and the village of Ilaka was isolated after the storm wrecked a bridge.[5][8] Throughout Madagascar, Manou injured 85 and killed 89\u00a0people,[10][11] including 23\u00a0people in Vatomandry and 2 in Brickaville.[7][12] About 24,500\u00a0houses were destroyed,[12] leaving 114,480\u00a0people homeless.[13] On May\u00a012, Malagasy Prime Minister Jacques Sylla issued an appeal to the international community for assistance.[7] Due to the damage from Manou, the French Red Cross activated its office in R\u00e9union,[6] providing one ton of medicine.[12] The Malagasy Red Cross had pre-positioned emergency supplies earlier in the cyclone season, and after Manou struck, the agency distributed a water purification unit, medicine, and tents to the affected areas. Due to road damage, supplies had to be delivered by boat,[6] which arrived in Vatomandry on May\u00a013. The delivery included 4,500\u00a0kg (9,900\u00a0lb) of supplies.[9] Workers quickly made repairs to power systems.[14] The Malagasy government provided $147,000[nb 2] to restore health centers in Vatomandry and Andevoranto.[7] Japan provided $80,000 worth of supplies, including tents and jerrycans.[12] Japan, the United States, Norway, and Germany donated about $1.27\u00a0million to Madagascar for relief.[15] The World Food Programme initially provided 90\u00a0tons of rice,[12] although ongoing drought conditions and storms caused the agency to continue providing food to residents in southern Madagascar for several months.[16]"

With favorable conditions for development, Japhet quickly intensified in the Mozambique Channel, reaching maximum winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) , sustained over 10\u00a0minutes. After stalling briefly, the cyclone turned to the northwest, weakening slightly before striking Mozambique just south of Vilankulo on March\u00a02. Japhet slowly weakened while progressing inland, dissipating over Zambia on March\u00a06. Along its path, Japhet dropped heavy rainfall that caused widespread river flooding. The rains occurred after an extended drought, although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage, notably around where the storm moved ashore. In two provinces in Mozambique, the cyclone damaged or destroyed 25,000\u00a0houses, leaving at least 23,000\u00a0people homeless. Flooding in Zambia caused rivers to rise in Mozambique several days after the storm's passage. There were 17\u00a0deaths in Mozambique.

Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, noting that environmental conditions favored development, including weak wind shear. The system developed organized convection in a circular pattern, and on February\u00a026, the MF and JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 13 and Tropical Cyclone 19S, respectively. With a mid-level ridge to the south, the depression moved generally westward, and after intensifying further, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Japhet by the Direction de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie et de l'Hydrologie of Madagascar late on February\u00a026.[2] After attaining tropical storm status, Japhet quickly intensified while it began moving to the southwest, due to a break in the ridge.[2] At 0000\u00a0UTC on February\u00a028, the MF assessed that the storm strengthened into a tropical cyclone \u2013 a storm with 10 minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). This was about 12\u00a0hours after the JTWC upgraded Japhet to the same intensity but with 1\u00a0minute sustained winds.[3] About 18\u00a0hours after designating Japhet as a tropical cyclone, MF estimated the storm attained 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) and upgraded the storm to an intense tropical cyclone; this made Japhet only the sixth such cyclone in the Mozambique Channel in 24\u00a0years. After further intensification, the cyclone peaked in intensity on March\u00a01.[2] The JTWC estimated 1\u00a0minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) with gusts to 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph),[1] while MF estimated 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph).[3] Cyclone Japhet maintained its peak winds for about 24\u00a0hours,[3] during which it remained nearly stationary. Subsequently, the storm began a northwest track toward the Mozambique coast, gradually weakening due to decreased outflow and dry air.[2] At about 1700\u00a0UTC on March\u00a02, Japhet made landfall just south of Vilankulo, Mozambique, with winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) as estimated by the JTWC.[1][2] The cyclone gradually weakened over land, decreasing below tropical cyclone status by early on March\u00a03. Japhet crossed into southern Zimbabwe, and both JTWC and MF discontinued warnings before Japhet dissipated on March\u00a05.[2][3]"

The rains were beneficial in alleviating drought conditions,[1] and dry grounds absorbed much of the excess rainfall.[5] After entering Zimbabwe, Japhet's rainfall caused the Save River to rise, causing flooding in southern Mozambique several days after the storm passed the area. The resulting floods affected 50,000\u00a0people in several villages.[7] The Limpopo River also rose to above-normal level.[8] High rains also caused some crop damage,[5] destroying 237,000\u00a0hectares (585,600\u00a0acres) of crop fields.[9] This included 12,325 downed cashew trees, 6,955 wrecked banana plants, and 2,495\u00a0killed livestock, all in Vilankulo; however, the rains allowed farming conditions to improve due to wetter conditions in drought areas.[10] Before Japhet moved ashore, Vilankulo reported sustained winds of 74\u00a0km/h (46\u00a0mph), with gusts to 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[2] There, the winds destroyed the roofs or damaged the doors and windows of 95% of brick houses.[11] In Inhambane Province in southern Mozambique, the cyclone destroyed several boats,[6] cut power lines,[11] and disrupted roads with flooding or downed trees,[5] which prevented communication with the province.[11] The storm destroyed 500\u00a0classrooms, 35\u00a0government buildings, and 7\u00a0health facilities. The cyclone damaged or destroyed 25,000\u00a0houses in Inhambane and Sofala provinces,[10] leaving about 23,000\u00a0people homeless in Inhambane alone,[11] which was the worst-affected province.[5] Three people were injured in Morrumbene by a fallen tree.[6] There were 17\u00a0deaths in the country,[12] which was less than from previous cyclones due to advance warning and coordinated government action.[13] The Zambia Meteorological Department warned of the potential of intense precipitation before Japhet moved into the region.[14] In neighboring Zimbabwe, ten hours of high rainfall nearly overtopped the Manyuchi Dam and destroyed a bridge.[15][16] The storm also damaged crops and destroyed houses in the country,[17] killing eight people.[18] After the storm struck Mozambique, the World Food Programme distributed more than 4,300\u00a0tons of food to affected citizens.[4] The agency had to transport goods via helicopter due to damaged or flooded roads.[19] The country's primary north\u2013south highway, which was damaged by the storm, had emergency repairs and was reopened within three days.[20] Mozambique's National Disaster Management Institute distributed 70 tonnes (69 long tons; 77 short tons) of maize, 8 tonnes (7.9 long tons; 8.8 short tons) of beans, and 80\u00a0tents to storm victims.[21] Lingering floods in Zimbabwe contributed to an increase in malaria cases.[22] The Delta Corporation donated $6\u00a0million worth of blankets and food to residents in the country.[23]"

        "content": "Severe Tropical Storm Delfina was a damaging tropical cyclone that affected southeastern Africa in January 2003. The fourth named storm of the 2002\u201303 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Delfina formed off the northwest coast of Madagascar on December\u00a030, 2002. It quickly intensified while moving westward, becoming a strong tropical storm before hitting northeastern Mozambique on December\u00a031. Delfina weakened while moving inland, and it was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January\u00a01, 2003. However, its remnants moved across the country and into Malawi, later looping around and crossing back over Mozambique; the remnants of Delfina were last observed on January\u00a09. In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000\u00a0houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief efforts in the aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops in the midst of an ongoing food shortage. Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique, and 47\u00a0people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600\u00a0houses and killed eight people. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected."

The system had a weak circulation, located in an area of minimal wind shear. At 1200\u00a0UTC that day, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France[nb 2] classified the system as the sixth zone of disturbed weather of the season.[3] It quickly developed,[4] organizing into Tropical Disturbance 6 at 1800\u00a0UTC on December\u00a030.[5] At around the same time, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 08S.[4] The convection became better organized, developing outflow and rainbands.[3] With a ridge to the south, the storm tracked in a generally westward direction toward Mozambique.[6] At 0600\u00a0UTC on December\u00a031, MFR upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 6, and six hours later the agency upgraded it to Tropical Storm Delfina.[5] While approaching the Mozambique coastline, Delfina quickly intensified, developing en eye feature and reaching maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[6] At 1800\u00a0UTC on December\u00a031, MFR estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[5] At about 2130\u00a0UTC, Delfina made landfall near Angoche in eastern Mozambique.[6] It rapidly weakened while moving inland, and MFR discontinued advisories early on January\u00a01, 2003.[5] Delfina entered Malawi on January\u00a02, where dry air affected the storm. The remnants turned to the northeast, drifting into Mozambique and later turning to the south. On January\u00a06, it crossed over its track and emerged into the Mozambique Channel.[4] When the remnants reached the Mozambique Channel, they were reclassified as Tropical Disturbance 07, which moved southward over waters. It re-intensified into a tropical storm on January\u00a08 before weakening the next day, becoming extratropical. The remnants persisted for several days, dissipating on January\u00a014.[7][8]"

A station in Nampula reported 281\u00a0mm (11.1\u00a0in) in a 48\u2011hour period.[3] Delfina washed out roads and bridges in Nampula and Zambezia provinces,[9] which isolated towns and disrupted the transportation network.[10][11] A train derailed due to effects from the storm, which cut rail travel between northern Mozambique and neighboring Malawi.[10] The cyclone destroyed or severely damaged over 18,000\u00a0houses,[11] which directly affected about 133,000\u00a0people, mostly in Nampula where 22,000\u00a0people were displaced.[12] Floods along the Ligonha River forced 1,800\u00a0people to leave their homes.[11] In Nampula and Zambezia, Delfina damaged four health facilities and 376\u00a0schools.[12] The storm caused a power outage in Nampula for several days, and in Monapo, there were water shortages after the storm.[11] The cyclone destroyed over 2,000\u00a0ha (4,900 acres) of beans and cassava crops and knocked down thousands of cashew trees,[11] in areas already affected by food shortages due to drought conditions.[13] Overall, Delfina resulted in $3.5\u00a0million in damage (2003\u00a0USD),[4] and caused 47\u00a0deaths in the country,[13] at least 19 due to flooding.[14] After Delfina moved through Mozambique, the local Red Cross chapter provided shelter, water, and relief items to the affected residents.[11] Residual flooding in northern Mozambique, compounded with lack of drinking water, caused a cholera outbreak that affected at least 400\u00a0people. By January\u00a027, 12\u00a0people had died from the disease.[15] Flooding also caused a malaria outbreak that killed 45\u00a0people in the country.[14] Government officials deployed food to the affected areas by airplane and by road, after workers repaired damaged bridges.[15] Residents in Mozambique gradually recovered from storm damage in the weeks after it struck.[16] Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas.[13] In neighboring Malawi, the storm's remnants caused flooding in seven provinces,[10] although it was not widespread.[17] Delfina damaged roads, and destroyed one rail bridge in Balaka District.[10] The storm destroyed about 3,600\u00a0houses;[18] which forced about 30,000\u00a0people to leave their homes.[19] The floods affected 57,000\u00a0properties, damaging 23,500\u00a0ha (58,000 acres) in the midst of a food shortage.[10][18] Delfina killed eight people in Malawi,[3] prompting President Bakili Muluzi to declare the country as a disaster area on January\u00a011.[19] After the storm, the Red Cross provided blankets and food for the affected residents.[17] The damaged rail line that initially prevented relief supplies from entering the country was repaired in early February.[20]"

(the publicly traded parent company of Activision Publishing) and Vivendi Games, the company owns and operates additional subsidiary studios, as part of Activision Publishing, including Treyarch, Infinity Ward, and High Moon Studios.[4] Among major intellectual properties produced by Activision Blizzard are Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, Guitar Hero, Skylanders, Spyro, Tony Hawk's, Diablo, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, StarCraft, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush Saga. Under Blizzard Entertainment, it invested in esports initiatives around several of its games, most notably Overwatch and Call of Duty. Activision Blizzard's titles have broken a number of release records.[9][10][11] As of March\u00a02018[update], it was the largest game company in the Americas and Europe in terms of revenue and market capitalization.[12] The company has also been involved in multiple notable controversies, including allegations of infringed patents and unpaid royalties.[13][14][15] In late July 2021, it was sued by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing on allegations of sexual harassment and employee discrimination.[16] The suit triggered an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[17] multiple workplace walkouts,[18] the resignation or dismissal of several employees, the loss of multiple company event sponsors,[19][20] and hundreds of workplace harassment allegations.[21] Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion on January 18, 2022. The acquisition was completed on October 13, 2023.[22] Activision Blizzard is a subsidiary of Microsoft Gaming along with Xbox Game Studios and ZeniMax Media.[23]"

        "content": "The original Activision company was founded in 1979, as a third-party developer for games on the Atari Video Computer System. In 1988 the company expanded into non-gaming software and renamed itself Mediagenic. This venture was not successful, incurring heavy losses. In 1991 a group of investors led by Bobby Kotick bought the company. Kotick instituted a large restructuring to reduce debt, including renaming the company back to Activision and moving it to Santa Monica, California. By 1997 the company was profitable again. Kotick spent the next decade expanding Activision's products through acquisitions of around 25 studios. This resulted in Activision publishing several successful series of games, including Tony Hawk's, Call of Duty, and Guitar Hero. However, by around 2006, the popularity of massively multiplayer online (MMO) games started to grow. Such games provide a constant revenue stream to their publishers, rather than only a single purchase, making them a more valuable proposition. None of Activision's subsidiaries had an MMO or the capability to make one quickly. Activision was also facing tougher competition from companies like Electronic Arts, as well as slowdowns in sales of their key game series.[24] Around 2006, Kotick reached out to Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, the CEO of the French media conglomerate Vivendi. Vivendi at that time had the games division Vivendi Games, a holding company principally for Sierra Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment. Kotick wanted to get access to Blizzard's World of Warcraft, a successful MMO, and suggested a means to acquire this to L\u00e9vy. L\u00e9vy instead offered that he would be willing to merge Vivendi Games with Activision, but only if Vivendi kept majority control of the merged company. According to those close to Kotick, Kotick was concerned about this offer as it would force him to cede control of Activision. However, after talking to Blizzard's CEO Mike Morhaime, Kotick recognized that Vivendi would be able to give them inroads into the growing video game market in China.[24] Kotick proposed the merger to Activision's board, which agreed to it in December 2007. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while Ren\u00e9 Penisson of Vivendi was appointed chairman.[25] The European Commission permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any EU antitrust issues in the merger deal.[26] On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[27] Vivendi became the combined company's majority shareholder at 54% of outstanding shares, equating to 52% if shares were to be fully diluted.[28][29] The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the NASDAQ stock market for a time under the ticker symbol ATVID, and subsequently as ATVI (Activision's stock ticker). At this point, L\u00e9vy replaced Ren\u00e9 Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[30] The merger was completed on July 9.[28][31] While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as Sierra ceased operation.[32] With the merger, Kotick was quoted stating if a Sierra product did not meet Activision's requirements, they \"won't likely be retained.\"[32] Some of these games ultimately were published by other studios, including Ghostbusters: The Video Game, Br\u00fctal Legend, The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena, and 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand.[33] However, a number of Sierra's games such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, and Prototype were retained and are now published by Activision.[34][35]"

Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly retained a 24.4% stake in the company overall. In addition, Kotick remained the president and CEO, with Brian Kelly taking over as chairman.[44] On October 12, 2013, shortly after approval from the Delaware Supreme Court, the company completed the buyback, along the lines of the original plan.[46] Vivendi sold half its remaining stake on May 22, 2014, reducing its ownership to 5.8%.[47] and completely exited two years later.[48] Activision Blizzard released a new title, Destiny, on September 9, 2014.

Activision Blizzard's stock price jumped nearly 40% that day in pre-market trading. The deal would make Microsoft the third-largest gaming company in the world and the largest headquartered in the Americas, behind Chinese company Tencent and the Japanese conglomerate Sony. Activision Blizzard's shareholders approved of the acquisition near-unanimously in April 2022.[71] While the deal has been approved by several countries ahead of the planned October 18, 2023, deal closure, including the European Union and China, both the United States' Federal Trade Commission and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority have challenged the merger as anticompetitive and have initiated legal procedures in their respective countries. To resolve these issues, Microsoft agreed to give rights to cloud gaming of Activision Blizzard's games to Ubisoft, which was cleared by regulators. The acquisition was completed on October 13, 2023.[72] The last time Activision Blizzard reported their annual financial results for its shareholders before Microsoft acquired them was on February 6, 2023. Activision Blizzard reported $7.54 billion in revenue and $1.52 billion in net income.[73] As part of the acquisition deal, Kotick announced his resignation as CEO the same day, along with other high level executives, though Kotick will remain onboard through the end of 2023 to help with the transition.[74]  Bobby Kotick departed Activision Blizzard on December 29, 2023.[75] In May 2022, QA testers of Activision Blizzard subsidiary Raven Software went public as the Game Workers Alliance (GWA) with the support of Campaign to Organize Digital Employees-CWA and voted to unionize with a count of 19 \u2013 2 in favor.[76] The National Labor Relations Board recognized GWA as a union.[77][78] Following the Raven Software's successful unionization, the 20-member QA team of Blizzard Albany announced a unionization drive in July 2022 as GWA Albany.[79] The vote passed (14\u20130), forming the second union at an Activision Blizzard subsidiary.[80] In February 2023, Activision Blizzard announced to employees that it would end its full-time remote policy starting between April and June that year.[81] On November 30, quality assurance staffers were told that the company would end its hybrid work model and bring employees in Austin, Texas, Eden Prairie, Minnesota and El Segundo, California  back to the office full time in 2024. ABK Workers Alliance accused the company of forcing out employees with this decision.[82] On March 8, 2024, 600 QA testers at 3 Activision studios in Austin, Eden Prairie, and El Segundo formed the union \"Activision Quality Assurance United-CWA\" and voted to unionize (390\u20138) in favor, making it the largest video game union in the United States.

        "content": "Worlds, Inc. was issued several United States patents around 2009 related to \"System and method for enabling users to interact in a virtual space\", which generally described a method of server/client communications for multiplayer video games, where players would communicate through avatars. In early 2009, Worlds, Inc. stated its intent to challenge publishers and developers of MMOs, naming Activision as one of its intended targets.[103] Worlds, Inc. had already challenged NCSoft for its MMOs in 2008. The companies ultimately settled out of court by 2010.[104] Worlds, Inc. launched its formal lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, including both Blizzard Entertainment and Activision Publishing, in March 2012, stating that Call of Duty and World of Warcraft infringed on their patents.[14][13] Activision Publishing filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in October 2013, asserting that Worlds, Inc. was using two Activision-owned patents in its Worlds Player software,[13][105][106] but this suit was dismissed with prejudice by June 2014.[107] In Worlds, Inc. case against Activision, the judge issued a summary judgement in Activision's favor, as they had demonstrated that Worlds, Inc. had demonstrated the technologies of their patents in their client programs AlphaWorld and World Chat, released before the 1995 priority date, though this was related to filing irregularities that were subsequently corrected by the Patent Office.[108] Activision did not challenge the updated patents through an inter partes review (IPR), and subsequently after a statutory one-year waiting period, Worlds, Inc. filed a subsequently lawsuit against Activision, asserting Call of Duty: Ghosts violated their resolved patents.[109] Later, Worlds, Inc. stated the intent to add Bungie to the lawsuit contending that Destiny also fell afoul of their patents. Bungie subsequently filed three IPRs with the Patent Office for each of the three Worlds, Inc. patents at the core of the lawsuit.  While Bungie initially won its IPR ruling at the USPTO, on appeal in September 2018,  Worlds, Inc. won a ruling questioning whether Bungie had legal standing to file its IPRs.[110][111] The new Worlds, Inc. case against Activision Blizzard was heard on October 3, 2014. With Bungie's IPRs pending at the Patent Office, the judge put the trial on hold pending the outcome of the IPRs. Worlds, Inc. challenged the IPRs at the Patent Office, as they did not include Activision as an interested party, a requirement that would have been necessary given the publisher/developer relationship between Activision and Bungie. The Patent Office did not accept this argument, and subsequently agreed with the Bungie IPRs that portions of Worlds, Inc. patents were invalid. Worlds, Inc. appealed to the Federal Circuit Appeals Court, challenging the validity of the IPRs due to the lack of Activision's involvement. The Federal Circuit court ruled in favor of Worlds, Inc. in September 2018, invalidating the Patent Office's decision.[112] Worlds, Inc.'s case presently remains at the Patent Office stage, which is re-reviewing the IPRs in consideration of the Federal Circuit's ruling.[113]  The lawsuit was dismissed in 2021, when a US district court ruled that \"Worlds' patents were abstract ideas that were not sufficiently transformative to be legally patentable.\"[114]"

Zampella and West created a new studio, Respawn Entertainment, with help from Electronic Arts' partner program, hiring the majority of those that departed Infinity Ward in their wake.[115][116][117] Zampella and West filed a lawsuit in April 2010 against Activision, claiming unpaid royalties on the studio's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Activision filed a countersuit against the two, accusing the pair of being \"self-serving schemers\".[15] Activision later sought to add Electronic Arts to their suit, discovering that Zampella and West had been in discussions with them while still working for Activision, and further added claims against Zampella and West that the two had not returned all material related to Call of Duty while they were working at Respawn. A separate lawsuit was filed against Activision in April 2010 by several current and former members of Infinity Ward on the same basis of lack of unpaid royalties.[118] All parties came to an undisclosed settlement to end all suits by May 2012. Electronic Arts and Activision had settled separately on Activision's charges of poaching employees, while the suits between Activision, Zampella, West, and the Infinity Ward employee group were settled by the end of May 2012. All settlements were made for undisclosed amounts.[119]"

        "content": "The 2006 Central Pacific cyclone, also known as Invest 91C or Storm 91C, was an unusual weather system that formed in 2006. Forming on October 30 from a mid-latitude cyclone in the north Pacific mid-latitudes, it moved over waters warmer than normal. The system acquired some features more typical of subtropical and even tropical cyclones. However, as it neared the western coastline of North America, the system fell apart, dissipating soon after landfall, on November 4. Moisture from the storm's remnants caused substantial rainfall in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. The exact status and nature of this weather event is unknown, with meteorologists and weather agencies having differing opinions."

        "content": "On October 28, 2006, a cut-off extratropical cyclone over the central north Pacific moved over an area of ocean with sea surface temperatures as high as 2 \u00b0C above normal, at 16\u201318\u00a0\u00b0C (61\u201364\u00a0\u00b0F), and stalled there for two days.[1][2][3] By October 31, the system had acquired convection, a warmer-than-normal core,[1] and an eye-like feature.[3] During this time, the storm had moved eastward, then northeastward, before turning northwestward.[1] On November 1, the system reached its peak intensity, and had estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and its most developed convection. After that, the storm slowly weakened, looped counter-clockwise, and headed east towards the west coast of North America. This system's center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1. The buoy's lowest pressure reading was 989 millibars (29.2\u00a0inHg). Other buoys indicated that a rather large area of low pressure was associated with the system. Buoy 46637 was not at the system's center of circulation, so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured.[1] On November 2, wind shear and cooler waters began to take their toll on 91C, and all convection was gone by the next day, when the storm was located roughly 520\u00a0mi (840\u00a0km) off the coast of Oregon.[1] On November 3, the storm made landfall on the Olympic Peninsula in the State of Washington, bringing tropical storm-like conditions to the Pacific Northwest, including sustained winds at 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) and wind gusts up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[4][3] Following its landfall, the storm rapidly weakened and dissipated on the next day.[4]"

Since it formed at 36\u00b0N, this system formed at the northernmost latitude of any cyclone in the eastern north Pacific basin.[6] The previous record-holder was Tropical Storm Wene, which formed at 32\u00b0N before crossing the dateline.[7][8] In addition, this system's track data indicated that it crossed from the central to the east Pacific as it formed at longitude 149\u00b0W and dissipated at 135\u00b0W.[6] Only two recorded other tropical cyclones had done this previously.[8]  However, since the storm was not officially classified, these records are not justified."

        "header": "Nature of the system",
        "content": "The classification of this system is debated, with various agencies considering it to be a tropical, subtropical, or extratropical cyclone. Mark Guishard, a meteorologist with Bermuda Weather Service, was of the opinion that the system had completed tropical cyclogenesis and was a tropical cyclone. Meteorologist Mark Lander thought that cloud tops were similar to several Atlantic hurricanes, Hurricane Vince in particular.[1] James Franklin, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, said: The system was of frontal origin... the frontal structure was eventually lost.... The convective structure resembled a tropical, rather than subtropical cyclone, and the radius of maximum winds (based on QuikSCAT) was very close to the center, also more typical of tropical cyclones... on balance, it was more tropical than subtropical.[9] Clark Evans of Florida State University reported that forecasting tools showed that the system's structure was consistent with that of a subtropical or marginally tropical cyclone.[1] NASA, a non-meteorological government agency, asserted that the system was a subtropical cyclone.[3] In its review of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, the Canadian Hurricane Centre considered this to be an extratropical cyclone.[5] In 2016, a study by Alicia Bentley and Nicholas Metz found that this cyclone underwent tropical transition, confirming its status as a tropical cyclone.[10] Since this system had one-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mi/h), which are above the 60\u00a0km/h (39\u00a0mi/h) boundary between a depression and a storm, it would qualify as a named storm if it was a tropical or subtropical cyclone. However, neither of the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for the eastern north Pacific, the National Hurricane Center[11] and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center,[12] include this system in their annual archives, nor is it included in the official \"best track\" file.[8] Hence, this system is not an official tropical or subtropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season."

The total impact of the disaster, including the reason for failure and the environmental consequences, are officially under investigation and remain unclear.[11] The owner of the Bento Rodrigues dam, Samarco, was subject to extensive litigation and government sanctions. In 2016, charges of manslaughter and environmental damage were filed against 21 executives, including Samarco's former CEO and representatives from Samarco's owners, Vale and BHP Billiton, on its board of directors.

Bento Rodrigues, which lies 2.5 kilometres (1.6\u00a0mi) away in the valley below the dam, was almost entirely flooded by the cascade of toxic water and mud[16]. The incident rendered Bento Rodrigues completely inaccessible by road, hindering firefighters' rescue efforts. The only available method of transport into or out of the location was via helicopter. There was a school in the area where the flood occurred, and the teachers were able to remove the students before the school was flooded by the toxic sludge. Other villages and districts in the Gualaxo river valley  were also severely affected by the disaster. The midtown area of Barra Longa, a small city located  60 kilometres (37\u00a0mi) from Mariana, had residential and commercial buildings flooded by the mud; the district of Gesteira, built on the banks of Gualaxo river, also had houses completely destroyed by the flood; some of the district residents were rescued by helicopter. Samarco and the neighboring communities did not have a contingency plan or evacuation routes in the event of dam failure.

According to the media reports, many of the deputies that composed such commissions had received donations from Vale to finance their campaigns. Such donations, up to R$2.6 million are legal, and were reported by the then-candidates to the Brazilian Election Justice. However, critics argued that the deputies' participation was clearly biased.[23][24] In January 2016, leaked internal documents from 14 months before the disaster revealed that Samarco had been warned about the possibility of the dam collapsing.[25]\nJoaquim Pimenta de \u00c1vila, an engineer who was regarded as one of the foremost tailing dam engineers in Brazil, had been contracted by Samarco between 2008 and 2012 to design and oversee the construction of the Fund\u00e3o dam.\nFrom 2013, \u00c1vila was hired part-time as a consultant to inspect the dam, and a technical report he wrote from September 2014 lists severe structural problems on the dam (in the form of cracks) and measures to mitigate them, the main one being the construction of a buttress. Samarco claimed to have implemented all the recommendations from \u00c1vila, and that the dam was in the process of being heightened when the impoundment reached its maximum holding capacity and began to leak. However, Samarco failed to comment specifically about the buttress, and claims that it was never warned about the severity of the structural damages, nor about the imminence of a catastrophic failure. In August 2016, the report of an investigation panel constituted by Samarco and its shareholders was published online [26] The investigation panel findings indicated that the liquefaction flowsliding resulted from multiple factors, including an increase in the saturation of the tailings due to modifications in the design of the dam and the presence of soft slimes in unintended areas on the left abutment of the dam. Another study indicated that the dam failure could not be predicted based on simple limit equilibrium analyses and that only a complex failure mechanism would explain the dam collapse.[27]"

Succumbing to external pressure, BHP Billiton, together with Vale and Samarco, signed in 2016 an agreement with the Brazilian federal and state authorities. In January 2016, the Brazilian government and Samarco reached an agreement and a fine of R$20 billion (US$4.8 billion) was issued.[31]\nThe penalty did not include compensation to people affected by the disaster, and the cost of recovering the polluted area. By July 2016, BHP made a provision of US$2.3-2.5 billion for costs associated with the compensation agreement between Samarco's shareholders (BHP and Vale) and Brazilian federal, state and municipal authorities.[32]"

In March 2016, Samarco agreed to pay US$2.3 billion in compensation. Australia's ABC reported that Samarco and its joint venture partners would \"establish a foundation to develop and execute environmental and socio-economic programs to restore the environment, local communities and social conditions of the affected areas.\"[34] In June 2016, an AUD$8 billion civil suit which was reinstated by Brazil's Superior Court after the original agreement was suspended. BHP, along with its Samarco joint venture partner Vale, face a separate $55 billion suit lodged by federal prosecutors.[32] In October 2016 it was reported that Brazilian prosecutors had filed manslaughter and environmental charges against 21 people[35] including top executives of Samarco's owners: BHP Billiton, an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia and the world's largest mining company, and Vale, the third-largest mining company in the world and the Public Eye People's Worst Company award winner of 2012.[3][36] In June 2018, Samarco, Vale and BHP signed an agreement to drop a US$7 billion lawsuit and allow two years for the companies to address the greater US$55 billion suit seeking social, environmental and economic compensation.[37]"

The class action is expected to be one of the largest in Australian history, with 30,000 BHP shareholders involved, with a combined shareholding of 330 million shares, valued at over AU$10 billion (at 30 October 2018).[40] In November 2018, UK-based legal firm SPG Law, now Pogust Goodhead, filed a US$5 billion group action in the High Court of Justice at Liverpool under Brazilian law against BHP Billiton on behalf of 235,000 Brazilian individuals and organizations, including municipal governments, utility companies, indigenous tribes and the Catholic Church.[41] The lawsuit is one of the biggest legal claims ever filed in a British court.[42] The case, which has been the subject of jurisdictional challenge, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[43] In November 2020, in the High Court sitting in Manchester, the claims were struck out on the grounds that they amounted to an abuse of the process of the court.[44] On 27 July 2021, the Court of Appeal granted the claimants leave to appeal against the November 2020 ruling.[45][46] In July 2022, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal opening the way for the case to proceed in the English courts.[47][48] In March 2023, it was reported that Australian mining giant BHP faces an enlarged class-action lawsuit seeking damages of up to $65 billion for its role in the fatal collapse of a mine waste dam in Brazil in 2015, with the number of claimants more than tripling to 700,000.  Approximately 100,00 claimants subsequently exited the claim.[49] Of the remaining 600,000 claimants, 200,000 had already received a total of $2bn in compensation through Brazilian proceedings.[50] In April 2024, it was reported that payouts from the court action were to be delayed past original claimant forecasts, with the case now expected to be completed in 2027.[51] Lawyers fees in the case are projected to exceed $680m[52] BHP continues to deny the claim in its entirety."

The note from the Mayor's Office said that \"at this point, the city of Mariana is focused on rescue work and support\". The Federal Government, through the Minister's Chief of Staff, Jaques Wagner, put the Federal forces at the disposal of the State of Minas Gerais. The Minister came into contact with the Governor, Fernando Pimentel, to put the Federal forces. Jaques Wagner announced President Dilma Rousseff by accident before loading it back from a trip to Brazil to Bras\u00edlia.[54] The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mariana said: \"We express our most heartfelt sympathy to the families who have had their homes and property destroyed and those who mourn the death of their loved ones, victims of this disaster of incalculable proportions.

        "content": "Hurricane Fifi, later known as Hurricane Orlene, was a catastrophic tropical cyclone that killed over 8,000 people in Honduras in September 1974, ranking it as the third deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record, only behind Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and the 1780 hurricane. Fifi is also the first billion-dollar hurricane not to make landfall in the U.S. Originating from a strong tropical wave on September\u00a014, the system steadily tracked west-northwestward through the eastern Caribbean. On September\u00a016, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fifi just off the coast of Jamaica. The storm quickly intensified into a hurricane the following afternoon and attained its peak intensity on September\u00a018 as a strong Category 2 hurricane. Maintaining hurricane intensity, Fifi brushed the northern coast of Honduras before making landfall in Belize the following day. The storm quickly weakened after landfall, becoming a depression late on September\u00a020. Continuing westward, the former hurricane began to interact with another system in the eastern Pacific. Early on September\u00a022, Fifi re-attained tropical storm status before fully regenerating into a new tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Orlene. Orlene traveled in an arced path toward Mexico while quickly intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane before landfall. The storm weakened after landfall and dissipated fully during the afternoon of September\u00a024 over the mountains of Mexico. Along its path, Fifi impacted nine countries, leaving over 8,200 fatalities and $1.8\u00a0billion (1974 USD; $11.1\u00a0billion 2024\u00a0USD) in damages. Most of the loss of life and damage occurred in Honduras where rainfall from the hurricane, peaking around 24\u00a0in (610\u00a0mm), triggered widespread flash flooding and mudslides. In a single town, between 2,000 and 5,000 people were killed overnight after a massive flood inundated the area. Fifi brought continuous rainfall to the area for three days, hampering relief efforts in what was the worst disaster in Honduras' history at the time. In nearby Guatemala, an additional 200 people were killed by severe flooding, making Fifi the worst hurricane to impact the country in nearly 20 years. Following the catastrophic damage wrought by the storm, relief agencies from around the world flew in emergency supplies to assist the hundreds of thousands of homeless people. Countries closer to Honduras, such as the United States, set up city donation centers that would send supplies to the country. In efforts to prevent the spread of post-storm diseases, the government allowed the burning of bodies as they were recovered. In a single day, up to 6,000 bodies were burned. Due to the extreme damage and loss of life, the name was retired from the list of Atlantic hurricane names and has not been used since."

        "content": "Hurricane Fifi originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September\u00a08. As the storm entered the Atlantic, satellite imagery showed that the system was already well-developed. Traveling westward, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea by September\u00a013. Soon after emerging into the Caribbean, convective activity quickly increased. The following day, a US Navy reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system and found a developing low-level circulation. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) until late on September\u00a015;[1] however, in the Atlantic hurricane database, it was determined that it had become a tropical depression during the afternoon of September\u00a014.[2] The NHC initially forecast the depression to continue its west-northwest track, eventually brushing Cuba,[3] although the storm never took the northerly turn.[2] The depression continued to organize as it turned westward, and late on September 16 the system intensified into Tropical Storm Fifi while just south of Jamaica.[1][2] As it moved due west, the storm intensified, attaining hurricane status roughly 24\u00a0hours after being named[2] following the formation of an eyewall feature.[4] At that time, the storm was asymmetrical, with gale-force winds extending up to 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) to the north and up to 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) to the south.[5] The storm turned slightly southwestward, and by September\u00a018, Fifi reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 971 mbar (hPa; 28.67\u00a0inHg). This made Fifi a high-end Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale,[1][2] which had been adopted the previous year.[6] Around this time, the hurricane had nearly doubled in size, with a gale diameter now covering an area 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) across.[7] Although earlier in the season Hurricane Carmen had attained Category 4 status in a similar location, Fifi was unable to intensify further due to its proximity to land. Most of the southern portion of the circulation was inhibited by the mountains of Honduras as it passed within 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) of the coast.[8] Fifi maintained its peak intensity for roughly 24\u00a0hours until it began to weaken shortly before making landfall near Placencia, Belize with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[1][2] After moving inland, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and further deteriorated into a tropical depression once it moved over southwestern Mexico late on September\u00a020.[1][2] Two days later, the former hurricane emerged back over water near Acapulco, Mexico, becoming the third known tropical cyclone to traverse Central America and enter the northeastern Pacific hurricane basin.[9] When it moved back over open waters, Fifi re-attained tropical storm status; however, it only maintained this intensity for 18\u00a0hours before being renamed Orlene.[1][2] There is disagreement amongst tropical cyclone forecasting agencies as to the role Fifi played in Orlene's development.[10] After the formation or merger of the systems, Orlene began to intensify. During the afternoon of September\u00a023, the storm intensified into a hurricane as it quickly traveled towards the north-northeast.[11] Shortly before making landfall, a small eye developed within the center of the hurricane, resulting in the NHC upgrading it to a Category 2 storm with maximum winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[2] However, the EPHC reported that the storm peaked with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Rapid weakening took place following the storm's landfall,[10] degenerating into a remnant low just six hours after moving inland. The remnant system persisted for several more hours before dissipating over the mountains of Mexico.[11]"

Residents were advised to be aware of possible rain squalls in association with the storm.[4] Additionally, small craft advisories were issued due to rough seas produced by the then-tropical depression.[12] Passing south of Jamaica as a tropical storm, Fifi brought heavy rains to the mountainous island, exceeding 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) in some locations. Severe flooding affected parts of Kingston, leaving some areas under 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) of water. Damages from the storm amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars, although no loss of life was reported.[4] In nearby Hispaniola, the system produced moderate rainfall that triggered flash flooding.[12] Small craft advisories were also issued for portions of southern Cuba as Fifi bypassed Jamaica.[13] Ships were advised to remain in port throughout the Cayman Islands as residents began to prepare for hurricane-force winds.[14]"

        "content": "Fifi first became a threat to Honduras on September\u00a017 when the storm reached hurricane strength, at which point forecasters revised their forecasts to anticipate landfall in Honduras or Nicaragua on September\u00a018 or 19. In response, officials in Honduras urged hundreds of thousands of residents to evacuate from coastal and flood-prone areas. Despite the warning, relatively few heeded these evacuation orders, likely playing a role in the large loss of life following the storm.[4] During the first day of the hurricane's onslaught, the region experienced winds of up to 132\u00a0mph (212\u00a0km/h) and unrelenting rainfall.[4] The first reports of damage from the Honduran government via radio stated that 14 people had been killed while over 100 were missing.[15] In just 24\u00a0hours, 182 towns and villages were completely destroyed. According to the Red Cross, between 800 and 1,200 people died within 12\u00a0hours of Fifi's landfall in Honduras. Buses driving through mountain passes skidded off the sides of cliffs due to slick roads, killing numerous people. Flash floods destroyed thousands of homes and isolated numerous towns. Waves, reaching 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) in height, destroyed moorings and grounded numerous ships.[4] Continuous rain fell throughout September\u00a019, resulting in widespread mudslides that killed over 2,000 people.[16] A large mudslide blocked the Choloma River, preventing water from the river and the accumulated 20\u00a0in (510\u00a0mm) of rain caused by Fifi from reaching the ocean.[4][16] The waters were released from this natural dam on September 20, when a concrete bridge broke upstream and tore through the mudslide. The torrent of water flowed down the valley, triggering a massive flood.[16] The city of Choloma was decimated, with an estimated 2,800\u20135,000 people killed out of a population of 7,000.[4][17] The flood occurred during the nighttime, so most residents were unaware of the impending catastrophe.[18] Other towns along the coast suffered similar fates as Choloma. In Armenta, roughly 400 families disappeared after a large landslide buried the town. However, the town is hardly known by people in the country and reports from the area were scarce. Another coastal town, Omoa (population of 2,500 to 3,000) was completely destroyed overnight on September\u00a019. All of the residents were assumed to have perished; however, like Armenta, few people know of the town and estimates of the fatalities in it ranged from 30 to 3,000.[19] Although by this time the storm was situated inland over Mexico, its circulation continued to produce thunderstorms over Honduras, hindering rescue efforts. Nighttime rescues were prevented by dense fog blanketing most of the mountain valleys.[4] The city of La Ceiba, population 53,000, was completely isolated from surrounding areas. Many were feared dead as newspapers reported bodies floating down rivers.[17] The death toll rose by the hundreds every day; at one point, the official death toll was estimated as high as 10,000.[20] There is still uncertainty in the total number of fatalities due to Fifi. In general, however, most estimates range from 8,000 to 10,000. Overall this ranked Fifi as the second-deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record at the time.[21] It was eventually lowered to third after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 wrought similar destruction in the same region, leaving between 11,000 and 18,000 dead.[22] Throughout the country, Fifi inflicted nearly $1.8\u00a0billion (1974 USD; $11.1\u00a0billion 2024\u00a0USD) as part of what was, at the time, the worst natural disaster in Honduras' history. Due to the damage that Fifi caused, Fifi is the costliest Atlantic Hurricane to reach a maximum of Category 2.[16] In certain coastal regions, only structures built on higher elevations were left standing. Many cities were more than 80% destroyed.[17] Fifi demolished over 10,000 well-constructed homes throughout Honduras.[18]  An estimated 150,000 people were left homeless due to Fifi.[16][23] However, the Honduran government estimated that between 350,000 and 500,000 were left homeless.[24] The country's banana crop was completely destroyed by the hurricane; as a result, its economy was severely affected.[4]"

Rainfall reaching 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) affected areas as far north as Campeche, Mexico.[4] At Chinandega, Nicaragua, rainfall from the storm amounted to 14.5\u00a0in (370\u00a0mm) over a four-day period.[34] The heavy precipitation led to significant flooding across the country as dozens of rivers exceeded their banks; hundreds were left homeless. The communities of La Conquista, Dulce Nombre, San Gregorio and San Vicente were isolated by flood waters after roads leading to them were washed away. In Chiquito, Izapa and Tamarindo, more than ten homes were destroyed and 50 people left homeless due to the storm. After the R\u00edo Coco overflowed its banks in Jinotega, 120 homes were destroyed, leaving 113 families homeless. Numerous other communities sustained similar damage throughout the country, especially near the Honduras border.[35] Hundreds of people in the town of Wiwili clung to treetops and roofs along the Coco River.[18] Although the storm made landfall in Belize, the country suffered considerably less damage than in nearby Honduras. However, winds up to 109\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h) were recorded. The combination of winds and torrential rains damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes in Belize.[4] Waves along the coast reached 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) above normal. Although torrential rains exceeding 24\u00a0in (610\u00a0mm) fell in nearby Honduras, only 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) fell in the country.[8] The country's $800,000 banana crop was completely destroyed by the storm.[36] Despite the severity of the damage, there were no reports of fatalities in Belize.[4] In Guatemala, the weakened storm brought extreme rainfall that caused extensive flash flooding. Numerous bridges, roads and homes were washed away or destroyed. At least 200 people were killed, making Fifi the deadliest in the country in nearly 20 years.[4] In El Salvador, the outer bands of Fifi produced flooding rains that killed at least ten people.[37]"

        "content": "In the wake of the storm, relief agencies and the Honduras government were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the disaster.[20] Rescue planes flown throughout the country reported that hundreds of bodies were floating in rivers and water covered areas once occupied by towns.[17] For the first three days, relief efforts were generally minimal due to the extremely poor state of the roads across Honduras. Numerous countries send tonnes of aid to the battered country, although it was initially stockpiled by the government until it could be properly distributed.[20] By September\u00a024, planes filled with relief supplies were being flown to Honduras from the United States, Cuba, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and Venezuela. Relief crews, overwhelmed by the number of bodies, began taking desperate measures to prevent the spread of diseases. An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 bodies were burned by September\u00a024.[16] Four helicopters supplied by the United States, from the Panama Canal, quickly began rescue missions. They airlifted survivors from flood waters and placed them on elevated land areas. The crew members reported that the people were desperate to get on the helicopters and during one mission, 34 people crowded on to one of the aircraft, which has a normal capacity of 15. Food packages dropped to survivors were fought over, some people reportedly fighting each other with machetes for the supplies.[39] During several of the later rescue missions, people died from starvation and malnutrition on board the helicopters.[40] From nearby Belize, Britain deployed 57 soldiers with motorboats to rush food to survivors in flooded regions. A group of 41 Cuban medical experts, including 21 doctors, treated nearly 900 in a period of two days.[41] By September\u00a024, more than 350,000 people sought refuge in shelters set up throughout the country.[42] Red Cross volunteers were overwhelmed by the number of families requesting help to find missing relatives.[43] Relief planes sent by the United States were initially delayed by continued inclement weather. Several days after the storm's passage, they were able to land in the country. These planes were loaded with food, clothes, water, medicine and other emergency supplies.[18] Juan Bautista described the disaster wrought by Fifi as \"the worst moment in the nation's 150-year history since independence.\"[44] Donation centers were set up throughout major cities in the United States by the Honduran Government. They planned to fill three planes and five or six ships with supplies that would be brought to the country.[44] In Miami, Florida, governor Reubin Askew asked all residents to donate to the Red Cross or Salvation Army to help those affected by the hurricane.[45] In St. Petersburg, Florida, a team of 14 doctors was sent to the country on October\u00a09.[46] Other doctors set up fund drives, one set for $50,000; however, officials in Honduras believed that this would be nowhere near the necessary funds for what would become a multibillion-dollar disaster.[47] Numerous other nations and relief agencies joined in the effort to aid Honduras in what was considered one of the largest relief operations in history.[48] Days after the storm, brigades, deployed by the Honduran military, began to reach the hardest-hit areas as floodwaters started to recede.[49] From Miami alone, 14 tons of relief goods were donated to Honduras.[23] Roughly a month after the storm struck, the United States had donated roughly 1.8\u00a0million pounds (816,000\u00a0kg) of relief supplies. Government agencies also began working on plans to revive the broken economy.[50] An initial plan costing $5\u00a0million to restart the agricultural business was set up and another $15\u00a0million was set to be given out as a two-year loan.[51] One group of people from a Baptist church in Texas spent $30,000 on a custom-designed food wagon to distribute food to the people of El Progreso. In some areas, residents did not know how to use certain supplies, such as toilet paper and tea bags, due to their culture and isolation from urban areas. \"...a British helicopter team dropped toilet paper and tea bags to the people of El Progreso, who are unfamiliar with both items. Using the toilet paper as wrappers, the villagers smoked the tea.\"[50] In Honduras, the Red Cross and other relief agencies quickly attempted to unload planes to assure that supplies would reach victims. However, some of the supplies were hoarded by the Honduran military as they quickly went to unload the planes. One of the incidents took place after a plane carrying supplies from Argentina landed and the military forced the volunteer members away from the plane. Once in the hands of the military, the fate of the supplies was unknown.[52] As the full amount of supplies did not reach victims, reports of people starving to death surfaced. Eventually, relief crews found these reports to be true as they distributed food to those who survived.[53] Following the storm, the country's economy suffered for two years. During this time, the annual deficit reached $200\u00a0million, against the annual income of $153\u00a0million.[54]"

        "content": "In 1977, a large-scale reconstruction project involving six villages across Honduras began. The first of the six project areas contained 121 homes with an average of 25 square meters of space. It was located along an important highway in northern Honduras; however, the rebuilding was initially delayed by erosion issues. The second plan consisted of 127 homes roughly a mile south of the first. The third, consisting of 26 concrete homes, was placed in the city of El Progreso. This project was determined to house the most people per home, roughly seven occupants for a preliminary total of 182 people. The fourth was the most isolated of the six planned constructions. In a rural area far outside urban regions, 92 homes were planned to be constructed. The fifth project, consisting of 33 homes, was placed close to the first project, having a similar access to the major highway. The final housing project, and largest, was set up south of the destroyed town of Choloma. A total of 600 homes, all built on concrete blocks and doubled up, were placed in this housing project.[55] On October 3, 1974, Guatemalan businessmen Dionisio Guti\u00e9rrez and Alfonso Bosch died when they went by plane to support the victims of Hurricane Fifi\u2013Orlene in Honduras. The plane was carrying a shipment of medicines that had been collected by the Rotary Club of Guatemala but was crashed by weather conditions and cargo near the village of Las Nubes. The descendants of the deceased, owners of companies such as Pollo Campero, Av\u00edcola Villalobos and Empacadora Toledo created the Juan Bautista Gutierrez Foundation to centralize a series of social projects that they had carried out for several years."

        "content": "On April\u00a08, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) first introduced a risk of severe weather in their day 6 outlook, valid on April\u00a013. The threat area included the South Plains and the Mid-South from northeastern Texas into southern Missouri, where maturing convection was expected to lead to all modes of severe weather.[3] Subsequent day 5 and day 4 forecasts maintained this area with little deviation.[4][5] In its day 3 outlook on April\u00a011, the SPC issued an Enhanced risk of severe weather for areas between northeastern Texas into southwestern Missouri, noting that a supercellular storm mode was likely to produce large hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes.[6] The Enhanced risk was later extended northward into southern Iowa on April\u00a012,[7] and by the following morning, a Moderate risk was issued across far northeastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana onward into central Arkansas. Several tornadoes, including some strong (EF2+) ones, were expected in the highest risk area. As a result, the outlook included a 15% hatched risk area for tornadoes.[8] An outbreak of tornadoes unfolded across the region as an expansive upper-level trough pushed into the Central United States, along with a 100kt jet streak pushing into Oklahoma and Missouri. A surface area of low pressure tracked from North-Central Kansas toward the Missouri-Iowa state border, supporting a warm front arced across southern Iowa, and a dryline extending from Kansas into Texas. Within the warm sector of the low, surface dewpoints rose to the mid 60s. A swath of 850mb winds at or above 50kt persisted underneath an elevated mixed layer, yielding an unstable environment characterized by mean-layer Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) of 1500\u20132500\u00a0J/kg. Throughout the afternoon, confluent low-level flow caused several discrete thunderstorms to form across Arkansas,[8] where the SPC had issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) tornado watch.[9] The most significant supercell of the day developed over LeFlore County, Oklahoma and eventually progressed into Crawford County, Arkansas, where it produced a half-mile-wide EF2 tornado that caused substantial damage in and near Mountainburg.[10] Into the evening hours of April\u00a013, the low-level jet kept intensified across Arkansas and Louisiana, with 850mb winds topping 60kt. Meanwhile, a cold front pushed eastward and soon overtook the dryline, forcing discrete thunderstorm activity into a quasi-linear convective system. With abundant moisture and mean-layer CAPE still on the order of 1,500\u20132,000\u00a0J/kg, the SPC mentioned potential for swaths of damaging winds with isolated embedded tornadoes.[11] Around 05:10\u00a0UTC, an EF1 tornado was developed southwest of Shreveport, Louisiana and progressed directly into the city. It damaged billboards, trees, and hotels before entering Bossier City; there, several mobile homes were damaged and a shopping center was severely devastated. After entering Red Chute, the tornado downed a tree onto a travel trailer, causing one fatality inside. The fatality marked the only tornado-related fatality of the multi-day outbreak.[12] Into the morning hours of April\u00a014, EF2 tornadoes impacted areas near Portland, Arkansas,[13] Carencro, Louisiana,[14] and in Meridian, Mississippi.[13]"

This outlook included a 10% risk area for tornadoes. The potent upper-level trough that sparked severe weather farther west over subsequent days began to tilt in a northwest-to-southeast fashion, forcing rapid cooling aloft and geopotential height falls over a large region. The surface low progressed from Iowa into Ohio and across the Appalachian Mountains, resulting in strong low-level flow and substantial moisture return across the severe weather risk area; dewpoints in the low to mid-60s caused an unstable atmosphere that ultimately led to a quasi-linear convective system and hundreds of damaging wind reports.[17] Embedded semi-discrete supercell structures within this line produced several tornadoes, including EF2 ones that affected areas east of Gilbert, South Carolina and the eastern sections of Greensboro, North Carolina. Another strong tornado moved through the Virginia towns of Timberlake and Lynchburg before reaching EF3 strength as it destroyed several homes in Elon.[18]"

The Chicago area saw 21.2 inches (54\u00a0cm) of snow and blizzard conditions, with winds of over 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[9] With such continuous winds, the blizzard continued to the north and affected Eastern and Atlantic Canada. Blizzard conditions affected many other large cities along the storm's path, including Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, St. Louis, Springfield, El Paso, Las Cruces, Des Moines, Milwaukee, Detroit, Indianapolis, Dayton, Cleveland, New York City, New York's Capital District, and Boston.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] Many other areas not normally used to extreme winter conditions, including Albuquerque, Dallas and Houston, experienced significant snowfall or ice accumulation. The central Illinois National Weather Service in Lincoln, Illinois, issued only their fourth blizzard warning in the forecast office's 16-year history. Snowfall amounts of 20 to 28 inches (51 to 71\u00a0cm) were forecast for much of Northern and Western Illinois. An ice storm ahead of the winter storm's warm front also brought hazardous conditions to much of the American Midwest and New England, and many areas saw well over 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm) of ice accumulation.[17][18] Numerous power outages, flight cancellations, airport closures, road closures, roof collapses,[19] rail and bus cancellations, mail stoppages, and school, government, and business closures took place ahead of and after the storm; many of these disruptions lasted several days. Several tornado touchdowns were reported in Texas[20] and a tornado watch was issued for parts of Alabama,[21] ahead of the cold front in the warm sector of the storm. In addition, thundersnow was recorded at some locations, including downtown Chicago.[22] At least 36 deaths were reported to be related to the storm, many of them in shoveling or auto-related incidents, and the total damages were US $1.8 billion.[23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][improper synthesis?]"

The storm later intensified and moved northeast, tanked, and developed a long warm front stretching toward the New England states, and moving northeast along this jet stream track. Lake effect snow events started over Lake Ontario and Lake Michigan from northeasterly winds. Following the predominant jet pattern, the storm developed a very rapid forward trajectory and began to migrate toward the lower Great Lakes. The heaviest snow fell in a wide swath from central Oklahoma to Illinois, Indiana and the Ohio Valley.

Despite the snow and ice that developed across the borderland, the major International Bridges remained open during the blizzard. Additionally, to help ease the electricity crash across Texas due to the freezing weather, Mexican officials arranged for the transfer of 280 megawatts of power to the United States via utility hookups located in Nuevo Laredo (across from Laredo, Texas) and Piedras Negras, Coahuila (near Eagle Pass, Texas).[49][50] The cold wave behind the storm's cold front left temperatures plunging to \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C (0\u00a0\u00b0F) in the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez metropolitan area, and in the mountains area plunging to \u221223\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22129\u00a0\u00b0F), resulting in the deaths of at least six people in the coldest temperatures recorded in the area in at least half a century.[51] In addition, 35 animals died at a zoo,[52] and closures of schools and factories occurred in the city.[53] On Wednesday, authorities in Ju\u00e1rez announced that convoys would be traveling out to remote regions and slum areas to ensure that citizens are warm and have the supplies they need to get through the next few days. On Thursday, Mexican officials suspended energy exports to Texas, citing cold weather damage at five power stations across Mexico that resulted in a total loss of 1,000\u00a0megawatts of electricity in Northern Mexico. Power stations in Mexico were able to meet the resulting energy demands in Northern Mexico, but could not spare additional electricity to aid Texas.[49] In Juarez, overnight temperatures in the single digits left 90% of the city without water service due to frozen pipes, and the failure of thermoelectric generators at a power station in Samalayuca, 30\u00a0miles south of Juarez, left citizens without power for roughly five hours.[54]"

The city of Chicago was unable to keep track of the license plates for each vehicle, which led to complaints from many drivers and by the time they located their vehicles, many were unable to retrieve them from the lots because they were parked bumper-to-bumper.;[61] on February 3, the City of Chicago reopened Lake Shore Drive to traffic before rush hour.[60] On February 1, the Chicago Public Schools announced that some schools would be closed and some would remain open on the following day (Wednesday, February 2), which marked the first district-wide cancellation of classes since the Blizzard of 1999.[62] Heavy snow and high sustained winds gusting in excess of 50 miles per hour (80\u00a0km/h), caused rail switches to freeze on the CTA's Red Line and blew a portion of the roof off Wrigley Field.[63][64] Northwestern University, Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago canceled classes Wednesday for the first time in over a decade due to the weather.[65][66] Over 39,000 state workers were ordered not to come into work due to the weather; this was the largest figure since a blizzard in 1979.[67] Mail service was stopped on Wednesday for six post office regions in Northern Illinois.[68] Amtrak train service out of Chicago was also canceled across Illinois on Wednesday.[69][70] In the central part of the state, numerous municipalities were all but shut down by the storm. On Monday, residents rushed to the stores to stock up on groceries, and numerous stores reported record sales.[71] On Tuesday, several school districts and universities pre-emptively canceled classes for Tuesday evening and all-day Wednesday.[72] Many school districts planned to close a second day in a row, on Thursday.[68] About 1.5 inches (3.8\u00a0cm) of snow fell Monday night.[73] Tuesday afternoon brought heavy snowfall and sustained 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h) winds, with gusts of over 50 miles per hour (80\u00a0km/h). Local government officials encouraged all businesses to close down, and local hospitals braced for the storm by preparing living and sleeping areas for essential personnel.[74][75] Flights from area airports were canceled, and local officials repeatedly urged residents not to travel, since because of the whiteout conditions, snow plows had been taken off the roads.[75][76] Interstate 80 was closed Tuesday night between Morris and Princeton. On Wednesday, I-290 and Illinois Route 53 were shut down from Lake Cook Road in Arlington Heights to St. Charles Road in Elmhurst. Forty vehicles were abandoned on Route 53. Parts of Interstate 57 were also shut down. The state police described most expressways as \"impassable\".[67][77] 50 motorists stranded on Illinois Route 47 south of Huntley received assistance from a snowmobile club, while dozens of motorists had to be rescued on Illinois Route 72, west of Hampshire.[68] During the storm's peak on Tuesday night, more than 100,000 customers were without electricity across the state, including 79,000 ComEd customers across Northern Illinois and 35,800 Ameren customers in Central Illinois.[78] Several charities set up shelters for the homeless and those stranded by the blizzard,[79] and Governor Pat Quinn mobilized 500 Illinois National Guard troops to help rescue stranded motorists.[80] Hundreds of motorists had been rescued off Interstates 290, 55, 57, and 80. In addition, over 80 traffic accidents were reported.[67] 11 snow-related deaths had been reported in Illinois by February 3. The body of an individual was recovered from Lake Michigan by Chicago Police. The pedestrian had reportedly been walking on a lake-front pathway when he had been blown into the lake by strong winds. In Grayslake, a man was killed in a crash while driving through the storm, while a woman in Mundelein died from hypothermia in her vehicle. A man in Chicago was also found dead in his home, which had no heat. In Barrington, a teacher died of a heart attack while leaving school on Tuesday. Five cardiac-related deaths from shoveling snow occurred in Lyons, Downers Grove, Mount Prospect, Carol Stream, and Glendale Heights.[23][24] In rural LaSalle County, a man died while trying to walk through the storm after his vehicle was stranded on a rural road.[26] 21.2 inches (54\u00a0cm) of snow fell at Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, making this the third largest total snowfall in Chicago history,[77] after the infamous Chicago Blizzard of 1967, and the Blizzard of 1999. 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) fell at the 1 N Abingdon mesonet site in Knox County, in West Central Illinois. This was the largest snowfall in the history of the mesonet. Drifts of 10 to 15 feet also occurred. Snowfall rates exceeded 4\u00a0inches per hour for a few hours on Tuesday evening as well along with thunder and lightning. Additional official snowfall totals included 20.9 inches (53\u00a0cm) at Chicago-Midway International Airport, 16.4\u00a0inches at the National Weather Service office in Romeoville, and 14.3 inches (36\u00a0cm) at Chicago Rockford International Airport.[81] The storm's highest total of 27 inches (69\u00a0cm) was reported in northwest suburban Roselle and Medinah, Illinois.[1] Peak gusts during the blizzard included 61 miles per hour (98\u00a0km/h) at O'Hare and 67 miles per hour (108\u00a0km/h) along the lakefront.[68]"

During the overnight hours of February 1\u20132, as the center of low pressure moved from Missouri to lower Indiana, it carried a warm front, with warm air advection and a shallow cold air pool at the bottom. This led to freezing rain in parts of Northeast Ohio. In Canton ice accretion ranged from 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.3 to 1.9\u00a0cm), which led to power lines and trees crashing, leaving almost 40,000 people without power. In the Greater Cleveland area, there was 0.1\u00a0inch of ice accretion and scattered outages in the Cleveland suburbs of North Royalton, where 2,000 people lost power, and also in parts of Garfield Heights and Maple Heights.

The Salvation Army of Central Oklahoma opened three shelters and one warming station for those stranded by the storm outdoors, the homeless, and those who lost power during the storm; two in Oklahoma City, one in Norman and one in El Reno, with teams from the Oklahoma chapter of the American Red Cross placed on standby.[98] Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City and Tulsa International Airport were closed, with Will Rogers remaining closed for 20 hours;[99] I-44 from Stroud to the Missouri state line, Interstate 40 near Okemah and westbound lanes of I-40 east of Henryetta were among many major highways closed, and the Indian Nation, Creek and Muskogee turnpikes were all either closed entirely or in stretches. Most school districts in the state including the Oklahoma City and Tulsa public school districts, as well as most Oklahoma City government offices were shut down a day in advance of the storm. The United States Postal Service released a statement saying that it was attempting to make deliveries across the state but that \"some areas may be undeliverable\", due to the heavy snow and very low visibility; mail delivery in Oklahoma City did not occur in most areas due to the conditions.[100] Temperatures across the state on February 1 and 2nd hovered in the single digits to mid-teens. Winds gusted to near 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) at times creating ground blizzard conditions across the eastern half of the state; wind chill values dropped as low as \u221236\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221238\u00a0\u00b0C) in Boise City, the lowest recorded wind chill in the state since the deployment of the Oklahoma Mesonet.[101] Heavy snow caved in the roof of a building on the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino complex in Tulsa containing a poker room and electronic casino games, the damage was confined to an area that was part of the original structure built in 1992. There was no one injured as a result of the roof collapse as no people were in the affected area at the time; the hotel towers, a concert venue, a convention center, and retail operations at the complex were unaffected and remained open.[102] The Tulsa World newspaper canceled its print editions on February 2, 3 and 4, citing the heavy snowfall and hazardous road conditions that could compromise the safety of their newspaper carriers, making it the first time in the newspaper's 111-year history that the print edition had to be canceled; however, the newspaper did continue to publish its electronic editions on its website.[103][104] A section of a boat dock at the Tera Miranda Marina Resort on the Monkey Island arm of Grand Lake collapsed due to significant snow accumulations on its roof, destroying four boats valued at about $450,000.[105] Will Rogers World Airport recorded an estimated 11.6 inches (29\u00a0cm) of snow, smashing the all-time daily snowfall record for February for Oklahoma City (the previous record was 6.5 inches (17\u00a0cm) on February 7, 1986).[27] Tulsa also set an all-time daily and monthly snowfall record for the storm that month, as the Tulsa International Airport received 14 inches (36\u00a0cm) of accumulated snowfall (the previous February snowfall record for the city of Tulsa was 10.5 inches (27\u00a0cm) in February 2003, and the previous record for snowfall in a single 24-hour period in Tulsa was 12.9 inches (33\u00a0cm) on March 8\u20139, 1994).[106]Owasso, Oklahoma received the most snowfall accumulation in Oklahoma with 21 inches (53\u00a0cm). Ironically days earlier on January 29, wildfires had burned parts of central and south-central Oklahoma, and ten central and south-central Oklahoma counties were placed under a burn ban due to very dry, wildfire-prone conditions. State Insurance Commissioner John Doak issued an emergency order to allow licensed claims adjustors outside of Oklahoma to help assess damages and losses from the storm for 90 days.[107] On February 2, Governor Fallin asked the White House to approve an emergency disaster declaration request for all 77 Oklahoma counties. In a statement by Fallin, state and local governments would receive 75% reimbursement for expenses associated with responding to the storm if the declaration is approved, including overtime costs, costs associated with operating shelters and clearing snow and ice-covered roads.[108] That evening, President Barack Obama granted Fallin's federal emergency request, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts in the state of Oklahoma.[109] Oklahoma State University held its home basketball game on February 2 against the University of Missouri as scheduled, despite the difficulty the Missouri team had arriving in Stillwater due to the blizzard. As a result of the storm, the university provided free tickets to fans who were able to attend the game at Gallagher-Iba Arena, which Oklahoma State won in a 76-70 upset against the #15 Tigers.[110] The storm system has caused at least three deaths in Oklahoma, one in a sledding accident and two in an auto crash. On February 1, a 20-year-old Oklahoma\u00a0City woman died due to injuries suffered in a sledding accident near Lake Stanley Draper, in which the sled being pulled by a vehicle veered off the road, flinging the woman into a guardrail; she was pronounced dead at the scene.[27] Two days later as slick road conditions continued across parts of the state, a truck carrying eight people ran off of a bridge and fell into the Spring River (which had been covered in ice), on I-44 in Ottawa County near Miami, killing two people; one of two westbound lanes of I-44 was reopened to traffic the previous evening after blizzard conditions made it impassible.[32]"

Rolling blackouts were instituted across the state as high demand for electricity left the power grid overloaded and unable to handle the demand. Governor Rick Perry asked for citizens to conserve as much electricity as they can to help ease the overloaded power grids. ERCOT, the governing body responsible for most of the electricity distribution in Texas, reported that more than 75% of the state was affected by rolling blackouts on February 2; at one point demand for energy was so great that utility companies began to purchase electricity off the national grids to meet the demand. Parts of Texas were expected to experience additional rolling blackouts Wednesday and Thursday as workers labor to get the electric systems back up and running. Post-analysis indicated that the cold temperatures had caused over 150 generators to encounter difficulties; loss of supply, instrumentation failures, and gas well-head freezing were some of the source causes.[112] Throughout the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, multiple large school districts were closed for a record-setting 5 days in a row, letting students out a whole week because of road hazards due to ice and snow. An ice storm affected areas as far south as Houston behind the main storm front, while three men were killed near Houston in traffic accidents.[113] The storm adversely affected activities in the week leading up to Super Bowl XLV, which was played at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas.[114] The storm caused a failure at a water treatment plant near Donna, Texas, prompting officials to issue a boil water advisory.[115] In El Paso, Texas, the storm left major roadways slippery with ice and snow, and the abrupt demands placed on El Paso's utility services resulted in sporadic reports of loss of water and natural gas capability. Freezing temperatures, including the coldest high temperature on record in the city,[116] resulted in the total failure of both of the city's natural gas power plants, resulting in rolling blackouts across the city.[117] The loss of power had a ripple effect across the region, as the power failure left water and gas utilities without the power needed to operate pumps to move the water and natural gas to customers. This resulted in the complete cancellation of activities at all area independent school districts and institutions of higher education on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and the following Monday. In total, nearly 200,000 El Paso Electric customers went without power at some point as a result of the storm, while 1,200 Texas Gas Service customers went without gas. Over 157 water main breaks due to cold temperatures were reported to the El Paso Water Utilities, which when combined with the frozen water pumping equipment and abnormally high demand for water left El Paso water reservoirs dangerously low. Stage 2 mandatory water restrictions, which permit the use of water for drinking only, were implemented Monday night as the water utility worked to raise the water levels in the reservoirs, and on Wednesday the water restrictions were lifted. That same Wednesday it was announced that federal and state officials would conduct an investigation into El Paso Electric as a result of the spectacular failure of the utility during the blizzard.[citation needed]"

        "content": " The 1959 Mexico hurricane was the deadliest Pacific hurricane on record. First observed south of Mexico on October\u00a023, the cyclone tracked northwestward. It intensified into a Category\u00a03 hurricane on October\u00a025 and reached Category\u00a04 intensity on the following day. After turning toward the northeast, the hurricane made landfall in Mexico near Manzanillo, Colima, at peak intensity. The system continued on that trajectory before dissipating on the next day. Impact from the hurricane was severe and widespread. Initially forecast to remain offshore, the system curved northeast and moved ashore, becoming one of Mexico's worst natural disasters at the time. Up to 150 boats were submerged. Countless homes in Colima and Jalisco were damaged or destroyed, large portions of the states were inaccessible by flash flooding, and hundreds of residents were stranded. All coconut plantations were blown down during the storm, leaving thousands without work and instating fear that it would take the economy years to recover. Torrential rainfall across mountain terrain contributed to numerous mudslides that caused hundreds of fatalities. In the aftermath of the cyclone, convoys delivering aid were hindered by the destruction. Residents were vaccinated to prevent the spread of disease. Overall, the hurricane inflicted at least $280 million (1959 USD) in damage."

        "content": "On October\u00a022, a low pressure area was present south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, having originated out of an area of disturbed weather in the region the day before. That day, two ships reported gale-force winds, suggesting that a tropical storm formed by 12:00\u00a0UTC. Moving west-northwestward parallel to the southwest coast of Mexico, the system steadily intensified, reaching hurricane status by late on October\u00a023. The storm continued to intensify, although there were few ships in the path to record the intensity until October\u00a026. During that time, interpolation of observations suggests that the storm attained major hurricane intensity \u2013 a Category\u00a03 on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson scale \u2013 with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a025.[1] On October\u00a026, the hurricane turned abruptly to the northeast toward the Mexican coast.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027, a nearby ship recorded winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph), confirming the increase in intensity. Six hours later, another ship recorded winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). At around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027, the hurricane made landfall just northwest of Manzanillo, Colima, with an eye 13\u00a0mi (21\u00a0km) in diameter. The Mary Barbara \u2013 a ship in Manzanillo Harbor \u2013 estimated winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h),[1] which was the basis for the previous estimated landfall intensity of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), which was later determined to be an overestimate.[3] The same ship reported a minimum barometric pressure of 958\u00a0mbar (28.3\u00a0inHg) in the southeastern periphery of the eyewall; this, in conjunction with other nearby readings, suggested a minimum central pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg). Based largely on the central pressure, the 2016 reanalysis concluded the hurricane's peak intensity at landfall was 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h), based on uncertainties in the wind estimates, the central pressure, as well as the storm's small size and slow movement. The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of southwestern Mexico. Within 12\u00a0hours of landfall, the system weakened to tropical storm status, and on October\u00a028, the storm dissipated.[1]"

After passing well offshore from Acapulco, it was forecast to head out to sea. Instead, it recurved eastward and made landfall.[23] The hurricane had devastating effects on the places it hit. It killed at least 1,000\u00a0people directly, and a total of 1,800 people.[4] At that time, it was Mexico's worst natural disaster in recent times.[23] Most of the destruction was in Colima and Jalisco.[24] A preliminary estimate of property damage was $280\u00a0million (1959\u00a0USD).[25] The storm sank three merchant ships,[26] and two other vessels.[27] On one ship, the Sinaloa,[28] 21 of 38 hands went down.[29] On another, the El Caribe, all hands were lost.[28] As many as 150 total boats were sunk.[24] A quarter of the homes in Cihuatl\u00e1n, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless.[26] In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk.[30] Large portions of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitl\u00e1n, Colima, suffered especially, as 800\u00a0people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos.[27] In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down and thousands of people were left out of work. That state's economy was damaged enough that officials thought it would take years to recover.[24] The hurricane also dumped heavy rains along its path. This water-logged the hills near Minatitl\u00e1n, and contributed to the huge mudslide late on October 29 that claimed 800 victims. The slide uncovered hundreds of venomous scorpions and snakes, which killed tens more people in the aftermath.[4] Additional hordes of scorpions were driven from their nests when the adobe walls crumbled away. Governor of Colima Rodolfo Ch\u00e1vez Carrillo and his wife issued a plea for venom inoculations afterwards.[23] In some places, the mud was 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) deep.[31] Water supplies were badly polluted, both by debris and dead bodies.[24]"

Strengthened by an atmospheric river, a powerful jet stream with winds reaching 230\u00a0mph (370\u00a0km/h),[7] and the most powerful El Ni\u00f1o event (the fourth-strongest one on record) since 1997\u201398,[8][15][16] the storms quickly developed while accelerating eastward. On the afternoon of January 16, the first storm reached the Pacific Northwest.[17] On the same day, a seventh, small cyclone developed to the northwest of the first storm, which looped northwestward into the Gulf of Alaska for a few days,[18] before dissipating on January 19.[19] The first storm moved ashore British Columbia on the afternoon of January 17, impacting the Pacific Northwest, before dissipating early on the next day, ending the first wave of storms.[20][21] On the afternoon of January 17, the second storm, the first of five powerful storms to impact California, reached the West Coast of the United States,[20][9] beginning a week of heavy rainfall and powerful gale-force winds.[3][22] The storm was steered northeastward by a blocking ridge of high pressure over the Central United States, and made landfall on British Columbia on January 18, before dissipating late that day.[23][24] As the second storm moved inland, the third storm arrived at the U.S. West Coast on January 18,[25] bombing out and reaching a peak intensity of 964 millibars (28.5\u00a0inHg) at 18:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. PST) that day.[2] Afterward, the third storm weakened and stalled of the coast of the Pacific Northwest while the fourth storm approached, which reached the U.S. West Coast on January 19.[26][27] The fourth storm began a small tornado outbreak in California on January 19, which would last until January 21,[28][29] and the fourth storm also spawned four waterspouts off the coast of Southern California.[12] On the afternoon of January 19, the National Weather Service issued two tornado warnings for San Diego County within hours of each other.[30] The third storm absorbed the fourth storm on January 20, restrengthening somewhat in the process.[31][32] The third storm then moved into the Gulf of Alaska for another few days, before dissipating on January 23.[33][34] On January 20, the fifth storm, the fourth storm to affect California, reached the West Coast of the U.S., beginning the third and final wave of storms.[35][36] The storm intensified as it neared the coast of Oregon, reaching a peak intensity of 970 millibars (29\u00a0inHg) as it approached the coast of Northern California.[37] The fifth storm then moved northward and weakened,[38] stalling over the northeast Pacific for another several days, before being absorbed into another approaching extratropical cyclone late on January 24.[39][40] On January 21, the sixth storm (the fifth and final storm to affect California) reached the West Coast of the U.S.[22][41] The storm rapidly intensified as it approached California, reaching a peak intensity of 973 millibars (28.7\u00a0inHg) that afternoon, just prior to making landfall on California near San Francisco.[42][43] This made the storm the most powerful winter storm to strike the Southwestern United States in 140 years.[1] The storm also tapped into the Pineapple Express, boosting the amount of moisture in the storm.[22] The storm broke low pressure records across California and Oregon as it moved inland, with a minimum pressure of 978 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg) recorded in Eureka, California, and a minimum pressure of 987 millibars (29.1\u00a0inHg) recorded in San Diego County.[10] The storm also produced an EF0 tornado in Ventura, California, as well as numerous waterspouts across Southern California.[22][29] The powerful winter storm weakened as it moved inland, but continued to affect California until January 23. The ridge of high pressure previously stationed over the Central U.S. had broken down by then, allowing the powerful storm to move eastward across the mainland United States, with the storm expanding in size as it moved eastward.[44][45] The sixth storm reached the Eastern United States on January 24, bringing rain and snow to the region.[46][42] Over the next couple of days, the storm moved northeastward into Eastern Canada, becoming elongated during that time, with the southern part of the storm splitting off into a new winter storm.[47] On January 27, the storm moved into the northern Hudson Bay and stalled, while gradually weakening.[48] On January 28, the sixth storm was absorbed into another frontal storm approaching from the southwest.[49]"

Rare tornado warnings were issued in parts of Southern California, including southern Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego County, and Anaheim. Flash flood watches covered Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties.[42] On January 20, an EF0 tornado was reported in Southeastern San Diego County, which lasted for 1 minute, 30 seconds. On the same day, residents in Siskiyou County in Northern California lost power for 30 hours, due to wet, heavy snow taking down power lines.[3] Jim Rouiller, the senior energy meteorologist at Planalytics Inc., said that the storms (particularly the sixth storm) were the worst series of storms the state had experienced since 1997 (when a series of powerful storms caused the New Year's Day 1997 Northern California Flood).[42] On January 21, the sixth storm broke the record of the lowest pressure recorded in parts of California, as the sixth storm registered a minimum barometric pressure of 978 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg) in Eureka, California, breaking the previous record set in 1891;[3] the storm also registered a reading of 987 millibars (29.1\u00a0inHg) in San Diego County (the storm had a minimum central pressure of 973 millibars (28.7\u00a0inHg) while it was in the Pacific, at about this time).[10][42] Rouiller expected that evening's storm to bring from 4 to 12\u00a0inches of rain, severe mudslides, a few tornadoes, and heavy mountain snow ranging from 6 to 15 feet across the Sierra Nevada mountain range.[42] California state water officials warned on January 21 that one week of heavy rain and snow was not enough to end the drought,[52][53] which was entering its fourth year by 2010,[52][53] though the precipitation from the storms had significantly reduced the severity of the drought.[56] According to measurements on Thursday, January 21, the average water content of state's mountain ranges' snowpacks, considered the state's biggest de facto 'reservoir', was at 107% percent of normal capacity.[52][53] On January 22, the sixth storm caused heavy rainfall in parts of Los Angeles, leading to additional flooding.[57][58] 500 people were evacuated from a small village in La Paz County, Arizona due to a flash flood.[57] Freshly-fallen snow blanketed the north side of the San Gabriel Mountains on the morning of January 23, 2010, northwest of Wrightwood, California, after the sixth storm had left.[57][58] Snow was also reported in many parts of California.[57] During that week, the storms dropped 8\u00a0in (20\u00a0cm) to 10\u00a0in (25\u00a0cm) of rain in Los Angeles.[16] By the end of that week, the storms had cut the power to more than 1.3 million customers in Southern California, due to the powerful winds downing power lines.[6] The storms also left a mess of trash and debris on the beaches of Southern California.[59] On January 25, Mayor Liz Harris of the City of Big Bear Lake issued a state of emergency, due to the damage caused by the storm.[60] In California, the storms dropped a maximum total of 20 inches (51\u00a0cm) of rain in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, while a maximum total of 90 inches (230\u00a0cm) of snow was recorded at Mammoth Lakes.[3] The sixth storm brought sustained winds of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) to the Western U.S., equivalent to a low-end Category 1 hurricane, with wind gusts up to 94\u00a0mph (151\u00a0km/h) recorded in Ajo, Arizona.[1]"

An unusually fast-moving tropical cyclone, it caused severe flooding in Central America, leading to widespread destruction and casualties, during early October 2017, before making landfall on the US Gulf Coast. The fourteenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Nate originated from a broad area of low pressure over the southwestern Caribbean on October\u00a03. The disturbance moved northwest, organizing into a tropical depression the next day and attaining tropical storm intensity early on October\u00a05. The storm made landfall in Nicaragua that same day and continued into Honduras with little change in strength. Nate began steady intensification over the warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. It attained hurricane strength while moving through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel early on October\u00a07, attaining peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) in the central Gulf of Mexico later that day. Early on the next day, Nate made landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. After crossing the marshland of the Mississippi Delta, it made its second U.S. landfall[1] near Biloxi, Mississippi early on October\u00a08, causing a storm surge to flood the ground floors of coastal casinos and buildings, as well as causing rip currents, hurricane-force winds, and beach erosion. Moving northwestward at 29\u00a0mph (47\u00a0km/h), Nate was the fastest-moving tropical system ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. It is also the fourth Atlantic hurricane of 2017 to have made landfall in the United States or one of its territories; such a quartet of landfalls has not occurred since 2005. In addition, Nate was the first tropical cyclone to move ashore in the state of Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina.[2] A total of 48 deaths were attributed to Nate: 16 deaths were counted in Nicaragua, 14 in Costa Rica, 5 in Guatemala, 7 in Panama, 3 in Honduras, 1 in El Salvador, and 2 in the United States."

Despite unusually low surface pressures, strong upper-level winds were initially forecast to prevent significant organization.[3] During the afternoon hours of October\u00a03, satellite imagery and surface observations indicated that a broad area of low pressure had formed over the extreme southwestern Caribbean.[4] The disturbance began to show signs of strengthening almost immediately; satellite images the next morning showed large curved bands of deep convection wrapping into the well-defined center, prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to upgrade it to a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, while located about 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) south of San Andres Island.[5] The newly formed cyclone traveled on a northwest course during its incipience, steered by a ridge over the southwestern Atlantic.[6] Later on October\u00a04, the inner core convection blossomed, with a well-defined convective band on the eastern semicircle.[7] The presence of a partial eyewall on the San Andres radar, coupled with surface observations from Nicaragua, incentivized the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Nate at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05.[5] 6 hours later, the system had moved ashore just south of Puerto Cabezas.[8][9] Combined with moderate southwesterly wind shear aloft, the storm's passage over the rugged terrains of Nicaragua and Honduras caused the cloud pattern to deteriorate, although its winds remained near tropical storm force.[10] This lapse in structure was temporary, however, as Nate redeveloped deep convection even before re-emerging over water; in fact, the cyclone exhibited some semblance of a convective ring on microwave imagery. Embedded within a larger cyclonic gyre across Central America, Nate maintained a northwesterly course across land, bringing the storm into the Gulf of Honduras during the early hours of October\u00a06.[11] Once over the warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea, Nate began to strengthen slowly, despite its broad surface center and the disjointment of the maximum winds east from the center. A developing subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic turned the storm on a more north-northwest trajectory.[5] NOAA and Air Force reserve reconnaissance aircraft sampling the system throughout the evening of October\u00a06 confirmed continued intensification; data around 02:30\u00a0UTC the next day, showing a developing eyewall, supported upgrading Nate to the season's ninth consecutive hurricane.[12][5] Continued flow between the ridge over the western Atlantic and the Central American gyre propelled Nate into the Yucat\u00e1n Channel and then the Gulf of Mexico on October\u00a07; in fact, with a 12-hour averaged motion of 29\u00a0mph (47\u00a0km/h), Nate became the fastest-moving hurricane on record in the gulf.[5] Favorable environmental conditions allowed the strengthening to continue: Nate developed a symmetrical central dense overcast, featuring cloud tops cooler than \u2212114\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221281\u00a0\u00b0C) and a sizable eye underneath, attaining peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) at 12:00\u00a0UTC. The hurricane reached a minimum barometric pressure of 981\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.97\u00a0inHg) 6 hours later.[5] Impinging vertical wind shear caused Nate's convection to rapidly warm and lose structure, despite the storm's attempts to form a more distinct eye.[13] Around 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08, Nate made its second landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h).[14] Deep convection migrated to the north and east of the center, and a curve toward the north brought the storm ashore for the final time near Biloxi, Mississippi at 05:30\u00a0UTC with winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h).[5] Inland, Nate became embedded within the fast mid-latitude westerlies, causing the storm to accelerate north-northeast while weakening to a tropical storm 30 minutes later.[5] Surface observations indicated a rapidly weakening cyclone, prompting the NHC to downgrade Nate to a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC while it was located over southwestern Alabama;[5] further advisories were relegated to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).[15] Nate continued to weaken, and degrading to a remnant low over Tennessee. A few hours later, the remnant low became an extratropical cyclone over the Ohio Valley. The extratropical cyclone moved northeastward into New England, then turned east-northeastward into Canadian Maritime on October\u00a010. The extratropical remnant dissipated near Newfoundland on early October\u00a011, as it degenerated into a trough rotating around another extratropical cyclone to its north.[5]"

In contrast, the capital of San Jos\u00e9 received no more than 1.4 inches (36\u00a0mm).[42] In the canton of Oreamuno, Cartago Province, a bridge and part of a riverside house succumbed to the forces of a river, swollen from the initial rains on October\u00a03.[43] By October\u00a05, the situation culminated: muddy waters surged through streets, neighborhoods, and even homes\u2014some submerged to their roofs\u2014as an increasing number of rivers burst their banks.[27][44] About 800 residents living in risk zones had to be rescued,[44] including 200 in Palmar Norte when the overflowing T\u00e9rraba River swept away houses and belongings.[45] The storm cut off drinking water to nearly 500,000 people, and left 18,500 without power.[27] Torrents, landslides, and fallen trees\u2014particularly in the provinces of Cartago, Puntarenas, Guanacaste, Alajuela, and San Jos\u00e9\u2014claimed the lives of 14\u00a0people,[17] and forced 11,300 into 170 shelters across Costa Rica.[16][46] The flooding was the worst to hit the country in recent years, leading to the \"biggest crisis in Costa Rican history\" according to President Luis Guillermo Sol\u00eds.[citation needed] In response, Sol\u00eds declared a state of emergency for the entire country on October\u00a06, as well as a national day of mourning.[27][47] The country's infrastructure, especially the road networks in southern regions, sustained tremendous damage from expansive flooding, landslides and subsidence; 117 roads throughout all provinces but Lim\u00f3n were affected in some way or form, 40 of which were rendered impassable.[48][49] Spanning 413\u00a0mi (665\u00a0km) through Costa Rica, the Inter-American Highway suffered various degrees of damage at 112 different sites, ranging from superficial cracks and potholes, to total structural failures.[48] At least 42 bridges collapsed, many waterways and drainage systems were overwhelmed, and a number of routes were practically \"wiped out\", isolating villages and leading to widespread disruptions in the transport sector.[27][49] Many petrospheres at the World Heritage archaeological site of Palmar Sur were covered with up to 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) of mud.[50] The infrastructural costs across the country exceeded \u20a110\u00a0billion (US$17.5\u00a0million), with repairs expected to take years.[51] With over 306,000 acres (124,000 hectares) of arable land damaged, the agricultural sector reported significant losses. Among the hardest hit crops were sugarcane, vegetables, grains, melons and papayas, especially in the Guanacaste, Puntarenas and Central Valley regions.[52] In Guanacaste, the storm converted pastures and sugarcane fields into ponds and washed out 3,200 acres (1,300 hectares) of rice.[53] Material damage from Nate across Costa Rica is estimated at \u20a1106\u00a0billion (US$185\u00a0million).[49] Total damage caused by the hurricane in Costa Rica was estimated at \u20a1309\u00a0billion (US$562\u00a0million),[5] making it the costliest natural disaster in Costa Rican history.[54]"

        "content": "On May 7, a tropical wave left the coast of Africa. The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean showing little signs of development until May 18, when a low pressure center began organizing along the wave over Costa Rica and Panama. The low entered the Pacific Ocean on May 22, and Dvorak classifications\u2014satellite-based intensity estimates\u2014began two days later. At first the system was disorganized, but convection quickly concentrated near the center, and on May 25 the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression One-E while located about 250 miles (400\u00a0km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico.[3] The newly formed depression moved very slowly due to weak steering currents aloft.[4] Moving towards the east-northeast over weak steering currents, the computer models used to predict the movement of the depression varied greatly, with one predicting an eventual Mexican landfall.[5] Located in conditions ideal for tropical development, the developing cyclone formed a central dense overcast, a large area of deep convection.[6] The depression steadily intensified to become Tropical Storm Adolph on May 26 about 225\u00a0mi (362\u00a0km) south-southwest of Acapulco. Adolph was in a low wind shear environment with warm sea surface temperatures and as such, the NHC forecasted intensification to hurricane status within two days.[7] Adolph turned northward on May 27, a turn influenced by a mid-level ridge building to the east and southeast,[8] thus causing the tropical storm to approach Mexico. A banding eye feature, a type of eye common in minor hurricanes, became apparent on satellite imagery. Convection around the eye deepened while the eye became more pronounced, and Adolph was upgraded to hurricane strength on May 27. On May 28, the hurricane passed within roughly 165\u00a0mi (265\u00a0km) of the Mexican coastline the next day, its closest approach to land. Shortly thereafter, Adolph turned westward under the influence of a mid-tropospheric ridge.[3] The high upper-oceanic heat content, good outflow, and lack of vertical shear[9] allowed the hurricane to begin a burst of rapid intensification, dropping 1.46 mbars per hour.[1] While reducing in size,[9] Adolph reached its peak strength of 145\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) on May 29.[3] Dvorak classifications reported a T-number of 7.0 for Adolph, equivalent to a low-end Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.[1] However, because of a lack of data from the storm via Hurricane Hunters, these strength measurements may be disputed.[10] After peaking in intensity, Adolph weakened while decelerating westward due to an eyewall replacement cycle; by May 30, the winds dropped to 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) as the eyewall became cloud filled and became less distinct.[11] The trend of weakening continued as the eye definition and convection oscillated in presentation.[1] On June 1 Adolph deteriorated into a tropical storm as convection became exposed from the increasingly elongated center.[12] As the storm passed over increasingly colder waters and into an area of stable air, the system weakened more quickly, and dissipated on June 1, while located about 460 miles (740\u00a0km) south-southwest of Baja California.[3] The remaining clouds persisted for a few days before dissipating entirely.[3]"

On August\u00a09, the hurricane struck the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula near Puerto Morelos, and weakened significantly as it headed inland.[4] Reaching the southern Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm on August\u00a010, the cyclone then underwent steady intensification: forty-eight hours later, it became a major hurricane, and peaked at 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) early on August\u00a013. At 01:00\u00a0UTC, the strong Category\u00a04 hurricane made landfall in northern Tamaulipas, 15 miles (24\u00a0km) south of Port Isabel, Texas,[4] and passed over Matamoros and Brownsville.[10] The system weakened as it paralleled the Rio Grande, curved into South Texas, and dissipated on August\u00a014. The storm caused several ships to be lost or stranded in or near the Yucat\u00e1n Channel. Hurricane-force winds occurred offshore of western Cuba.[10] Hitting close to the Mexico\u2013United States border, the powerful cyclone severely impacted both nations. The pressure in the storm was determined to be 931\u00a0mb (27.5\u00a0inHg) at the time of landfall,[11] based on a reading of 28.315\u00a0inHg (958.9\u00a0mb) coincident with hurricane-force winds at Brownsville, an inland site.[10] The cyclone destroyed three hundred homes in Matamoros and downed buildings and fences in Brownsville. At the latter place, debris covered streets.[2] Strong winds destroyed twenty structures at Fort Brown, the barracks sustained damage, and thirty-five horses and mules died. Ten vessels sank in the Rio Grande and at Port Isabel, resulting in three deaths.[10] The storm levelled buildings, killed domestic pigs, and generated a storm surge of 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) on Padre Island.[8] The storm also ruined 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) of track bed in Texas. Seven deaths took place on land: two in Matamoros,[10] \"at least\" five in Brownsville.[8] Total fatalities in the storm numbered thirty or more, primarily at sea.[12]"

Pursuing a parabolic path, it headed west-southwest across Saint Lucia,[13] and a ship noted heavy squalls near Guadeloupe.[10] On August\u00a016, the fast-moving tropical storm, then nearing hurricane intensity, turned westward over the eastern Caribbean Sea. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018, upon reaching hurricane status, it commenced a northwestward course toward Jamaica.[4] On the same date, the ship Nith registered a pressure of 29.15\u00a0inHg (987\u00a0mb) in the storm.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019, the cyclone peaked with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), and shortly afterward struck Kingston, Jamaica. While traversing eastern Jamaica, the cyclone weakened, and turned northward to strike Pil\u00f3n, Cuba, with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). The storm lost hurricane intensity after landfall, turned to the north-northeast, and swiftly crossed the Bahamas on August\u00a020. The storm was last identifiable at 18:00\u00a0UTC, over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[4] The eye of the storm passed directly over Kingston, Jamaica, with a measured central pressure of 28.93\u00a0inHg (980\u00a0mb). In Jamaica, the storm inflicted \"immense\" destruction.[2] At Yallahs, the storm wrecked fifty-nine houses. In Saint George Parish, 116 homes were levelled. Hundreds of homes were destroyed at Richmond. The local hospital, chapels, and a church were destroyed at Morant Bay. In Saint John Parish, the storm destroyed forty houses. The military barracks at Up-Park Camp were destroyed, with losses totalling $50,000.[nb 2] Banana crops were destroyed in a 12-mile (19\u00a0km) area near Port Maria.[10] Of the forty-five vessels at anchor in Kingston, only two were undamaged. Most of the wharves in Kingston were destroyed.[2] The hurricane was responsible for thirty deaths in Jamaica.[12] The hurricane brought squally conditions to eastern Cuba. Manzanillo recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 29.30\u00a0inHg (992\u00a0mb).[10] A preliminary reanalysis in 2014 classified the storm as a Category\u00a03 hurricane in Jamaica,[3] based on an unconfirmed ship report of 28.40\u00a0inHg (962\u00a0mb).[10]"

Snow and brig H. Houston capsized south of Bermuda, while the hurricane also dismasted the Saint Jose.[2] Early on August\u00a027, the cyclone intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson scale and peaked with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h).[4] As the storm approached Florida on August\u00a029, the steamship recorded a barometric pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg),[2] the lowest in relation to the system. The storm would retain that intensity until after making landfall just to the south of Cocoa Beach around 12:00\u00a0UTC. It passed over the peninsula and weakened to a tropical storm, but managed to become a hurricane prior to its second Florida landfall near Apalachicola early on August\u00a031. The storm continued northwestward, dissipating over Mississippi on the September\u00a01.[4] The hurricane caused 68\u00a0deaths when, north of what is now Cape Canaveral, it caused a steamship, the City of Vera Cruz, to be wrecked.[14] Seven survivors reported that the vessel split into two, drowning anyone who had not abandoned the ship. Additionally, the cyclone wrecked the schooner Rosa Esppinger north of Cape Canaveral and stranded the brig Long Beach at Turtle Mound and two other ships near the Ponce de Leon Inlet.[2] On land, storm surge flooded barrier islands and many coastal waterways.[15] Heavy rainfall inundated post roads and washed away many bridges in Central Florida, disrupting communications by mail between Ocala and Tampa.[16] Cedar Key observed a sustained wind speed of 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) before the anemometer was damaged, while Pensacola recorded sustained winds of 32\u00a0mph (51\u00a0km/h).[2] Crops also suffered significant damage in Florida, with a Weather Bureau report published decades later noting that the storm \"turned garden vegetables into seaweed.\"[15]"

Damage from these four islands totaled US$150,000,[7] and two indirect deaths occurred in Lanai.[10] Extensive damage occurred on Kauai as Dot made landfall, producing wind gusts as high as 103\u00a0mph (166\u00a0km/h) and toppling trees and power lines.[7] Widespread power outages affected the island,[11] causing telecommunications and water systems to fail.[12] Although infrastructure was damaged to an extent by floodwater and strong winds, crops suffered the most losses. Cane sugar crops sustained US$2.7\u00a0million in losses.[9] Overall, damage from Dot across Hawaii totaled US$6\u00a0million,[7][9] and a disaster area declaration and state of emergency took effect for the archipelago after the hurricane's passage.[13][14]"

Earlier stages were missed because of a lack of data in the isolated area. Six hours after classification, Patsy reached Category 5 strength, with winds of 160\u00a0mph, although it is possible Category 5 status was reached before. A trough moved Patsy northeast. The trough then weakened, and allowed Patsy to curve northwest. The Japan Meteorological Agency's best track at this time Patsy crossed the dateline, at Category 4 strength. A second trough then formed, dominated the first, and recurved Patsy northeast, recrossing the dateline, at Category 3 intensity. The storm then quickly weakened due to unfavorable conditions, while slowly curving northwards. From reports, it is estimated Patsy dissipated on September 10, though other reports credit Patsy with having regenerated as a tropical depression on September 13, north of Hawaii. Patsy's track around the International Date Line was unseen and erratic. Typhoon June's track one year prior was somewhat similar to Patsy's.[7] Patsy is also an uncommon west to east crosser of the dateline, and one of only a few storms known to have crossed the dateline twice.[6] Including only systems recognized by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, there have been only six other recorded systems that have crossed the dateline from west to east.[18] The National Hurricane Center's \"best track\" data set has Patsy exclusively east of the dateline from detection to dissipation.[19] The Japan Meteorological Agency's \"best track\" does not give wind speeds, only indicating that Patsy was a typhoon.[20] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center's report disagrees on location but also has Patsy's maximum windspeed east of the dateline.[6] Patsy was the first known Pacific hurricane to reach Category\u00a05 intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[19] Also, its maximum reported windspeed of 150 knots (280\u00a0km/h) makes it the central Pacific hurricane with the highest sustained winds until Hurricane John tied this record in 1994."

It was once a thriving upriver market located across the Savannah River from Augusta, Georgia in the Edgefield District. It was founded by Henry Shultz in 1821 who named it after his home town in Germany of the same name. The town was one of the state's primary interior markets by the 1830s, due largely to the fact that the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company chose Hamburg as the western terminus of its line to Charleston. The enervation of the town, which relied on its in-land port being the destination of cotton headed toward the ports of Charleston or Savannah for business, began in 1848 after Augusta siphoned much of the town's river traffic with the completion of the Augusta Canal. The town's decline was finalized in the 1850s when the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company extended its line into Augusta. After the American Civil War, Hamburg was repopulated mostly by freedmen and was within newly organized Aiken County. The town became notorious in 1876 as the site of a massacre of blacks by whites in what was one of a number of violent incidents by Democratic paramilitary groups to suppress black voting in that year's elections. The Democrats regained control of the state government and federal troops were withdrawn the next year from South Carolina and other states, ending the Reconstruction era."

But, by 1813, the business dealings of Shultz had elevated him to a position capable of building a long-lasting bridge across the Savannah River, a feat which one of the wealthiest South Carolinian of the 1790s, Wade Hampton I, had failed to accomplish on two previous occasions.[2] Shultz would go on to become a leading citizen in the city of Augusta, owning part of the Steamboat Company of Georgia as well as a wharf in Augusta. But, like many bank owners (Shultz used his bridge to back a bank which he called the Bridge Bank) in the 1810s, Shultz issued paper currency which led to his bankruptcy during the Panic of 1819. After being sued by his creditors, the Georgia state officials seized the Augusta Bridge from Shultz.[3]:\u200a20 Shultz felt slighted by the city of Augusta and purchased a swath of land opposite the Savannah River which had previously been owned by Chickasaw indians in order to compete with the city.[3]:\u200a21\u200a The following year, Shultz sought and procured loans from the South Carolina General Assembly to improve inland navigation between the town and Charleston. On top of this, the General Assembly exempted all taxable property within the town from taxation for five years.[3]:\u200a22 Shultz established a second bank, the Bank of Hamburg, in 1823, backed by his Hamburg property which \"faded into oblivion\" within two years.[4] Ten years later, a decade bank was founded with support from the General Assembly. This second iteration became one of the best-known banks in the country, reliable enough to be used by many families to pay colleges in the North.[3]:\u200a25\u200a The establishment of the second bank coincided with the decline of the South Carolina wagon trade. From 1819 to 1823, the trade shrunk to one-fourth its former size as steamboats became the cheaper form of transportation for upcountry harvests.[5]:\u200a39\u200a The emergence of steamboats led Hamburg and other towns strategically located at the fall lines of major rivers such as Camden and Columbia to become economically important for the first time.[3]:\u200a40 During his American tour as 'Guest of the Nation', the Marquis de Lafayette visited Hamburg on March 24, 1825.[6] In a book recounting their trip, Lafayette's secretary wrote that Lafayette was invited to visit \"a sort of prodigy\", a \"village called Hamburg\", which was \"not yet two years old and its port was already filled with vessels.\"[7]"

        "content": " Tropical Cyclone Eloise was the strongest tropical cyclone to impact the country of Mozambique since Cyclone Kenneth in 2019 and the second of three consecutive tropical cyclones to impact Mozambique in the 2020\u201321 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. The seventh tropical depression, fifth named storm and the second tropical cyclone of the season, Eloise's origins can be traced to a disturbance over the central portion of the South-West Indian Ocean basin which developed into a tropical depression on 16 January, and strengthened into a tropical storm on 17 January, though the storm had limited strength and organization. On the next day, the storm entered a more favorable environment, and it soon intensified to a severe tropical storm on 18 January. Late on 19 January, Eloise made landfall in northern Madagascar as a moderate tropical storm, bringing with it heavy rainfall and flooding. The storm traversed Madagascar and entered the Mozambique Channel in the early hours of 21 January. After moving southwestward across the Mozambique Channel for an additional 2 days, Eloise strengthened into a Category 1-equivalent cyclone, due to low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures. Early on 23 January, Eloise peaked as a Category\u00a02-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale as the center of the storm began to move ashore in Mozambique. Shortly afterward, Eloise made landfall just north of Beira, Mozambique, before rapidly weakening. Subsequently, Eloise weakened into a remnant low over land on 25 January, dissipating soon afterward. Preparations for the advancing storm took place in Madagascar before Eloise's landfall and in multiple other African countries. For Madagascar, widespread warnings and alerts were issued as the storm approached northern Madagascar. For Mozambique, high alerts were put in place for central portions of the country. Humanitarian responders prepared for response after the storms passing. Beira's port also closed for about 40 hours, and limited supplies of emergency non-food items were given. Many families were sheltered in tents at accommodation centers, and received kits for food, hygiene, and COVID-19 protection. Officials in Zimbabwe warned of ravine and flash flooding, which may cause infrastructure damage. Several northern provinces of South Africa were expected to experience heavy rains, which prompted severe risk warnings for them. Disaster management teams were placed on high alert ahead of the storm. Extreme flooding occurred throughout central Mozambique, with many areas being flooded due to continuous heavy rains weeks prior to Eloise's landfall. More than 100,000 people have been displaced and dams are at a tipping point. Infrastructure has taken a heavy hit. Approximately 100,000 people were evacuated by 23 January, although the number is expected to grow to 400,000. Flooding and damage have been less than feared.[2] Weak shelters set up for the cyclone were either damaged or destroyed. Beira was completely flooded, and the impacts were comparable to those of Cyclone Idai, though they were far less severe. Farmland was damaged as well. Teams were sent out to assess the damage and repair it. There have been 27 confirmed deaths, with one in Madagascar, 11 in Mozambique, three in Zimbabwe, 10 in South Africa, and two in Eswatini.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Eleven additional people are currently missing.[8][9][6][10] Current damage from the storm is estimated to exceed $10 million (2021 USD) in Southern Africa.[11]"

        "content": "On 14 January, a zone of disturbed weather formed over the central South Indian Ocean to the east of another system and gradually organized while moving westward.[12] On 16 January, the system organized into a tropical depression.[13] With the presence of persisting deep convection, the system eventually strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Eloise on 17 January.[14] Initially, Eloise struggled to strengthen further from the presence of strong easterly shear and dry air, which caused Eloise's thunderstorm activity to be displaced to the west.[15] Despite the presence of this shear and mid-level dry air, Eloise continued to intensify, with convection wrapping into an eye feature and outflow becoming increasingly defined, marking the intensification of Eloise into a severe tropical storm on 19 January, while heading westward towards Madagascar.[16] This intensification trend did not last for a long time, as Eloise made a small turn to the north and then made landfall in Antalaha, Madagascar, whilst weakening back to a moderate tropical storm, due to land interaction with the mountains of Madagascar.[17] The next day, Eloise weakened to a tropical depression due to land interaction, with deep convection over its center eroded though it maintained flaring convection over the northern semicircle.[18] On 20 January, Eloise emerged into the Mozambique Channel, where Eloise began to slowly reintensify, with warm waters, a moist environment, little shear, but weak upper-level divergence contributing to the storm's slow strengthening trend.[19] However, some upper-level convergence hindered convection from developing quickly, though all other factors were relatively favorable.[20] Soon afterward, the upper-level convergence began to decrease, allowing the system to begin rapidly strengthening.[21] On 21 January, Eloise's outflow became robust, though its strength was limited, due to land interaction in the northern semicircle of the storm, having the strongest winds in the southeast quadrant and sustaining much weaker winds elsewhere. Despite sustained land interaction, Eloise strengthened, with improving poleward outflow and tightly wrapped banding features wrapping into a small eye.[22] On 22 January, Eloise significantly improved in organization as it moved southwestward across the Mozambique Channel. Later that day, Eloise strengthened into a Category\u00a01-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHWS), as it neared the coast of Mozambique, given the favorable conditions in the region. Early on 23 January, Eloise strengthened further and peaked as a Category\u00a02-equivalent tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 967 millibars (28.6\u00a0inHg), as the storm's eyewall began moving ashore. Soon afterward, Eloise made landfall just north of Beira, Mozambique, at the same intensity.[23][24] Following landfall, Eloise rapidly deteriorated, with the storm weakening back into a moderate tropical storm within 12 hours and the eye completely disappearing.[25] As the storm moved further inland, Eloise weakened rapidly, due to interaction with the rugged terrain and dry air.[26] Later that day, Eloise weakened into a tropical depression as it tracked further inland.[27] On 25 January, Eloise degenerated into a remnant low, and the MFR issued their final advisory on the system, with the storm dissipating soon afterward.[28]"

Aerial assessments using photo and geo-tracking system were also planned for the impact of the storm.[29] The local contingency plan in the north-eastern part of the country and the early warning system at the community level was activated. Emergency stocks are available in many districts in the most at-risk areas.[30] On 18 January, the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) gave the storm a green alert, which pointed to a wind impact of 0.5. The next day, GDACS upgraded the storm alert to an orange alert, which pointed to a higher 1.5 wind impact.[31][32][33] With Eloise enhancing heavy rainfall, landslides, flash floods, and widespread flooding were expected.[34] Moreover, waves up 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) were expected in Antongil Bay.[35]"

The Meteorological Services Department of Zimbabwe had warned of heavy rainfall, flooding, destructive winds and lightning on 23 January in parts of the country due to Tropical Cyclone Eloise.[40] Widespread flooding, and water-related damage to infrastructure was expected. Sipho Hlomuka, a co-operative governance and traditional affairs for KwaZulu-Natal, had placed disaster management teams on high alert.[41] Disaster management teams were put on high alert in Limpopo ahead of the cyclones expected impacts in the region.[42] Alert nines were issued for Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Basikopo Makamu, Limpopo's Cooperative Governance MEC, said the SANDF were on standby to help rescue people who may be cut off or trapped due to Eloise.[43] The Gauteng emergency response team is on alert. They have activated contingency plans, to assist Gauteng and other surrounding provinces.[44] SAWS has issued red alerts for disruptive rains over Lowveld areas of Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces as well as the eastern Highveld areas. These will persist until 25 January. The weather service warned that rainfall may add to saturated grounds and worsen potential flooding, mudslides, and rockfalls. These may disrupt essential services, like food, water, sanitation, electricity, and communication.[45] On 27 January, SAWS issued warnings for disruptive landfall from 26 January to 29 January.

Due to flooding, cars were submerged in water; walls of some low lying buildings collapsed and swathes of land were flooded in Beira, while the power supply was shut down as Eloise damaged power lines and uprooted some electricity poles, power utility EDM noted.[56] IOM Mozambique also reported that due to heavy rainfall and discharge of water from the Chicamba dam and the Manuzi Reservoir, 19,000 people were affected in that area. Cyclones cause major flooding, which can drown animals and destroy their natural environments. When smaller animals and food supplies disappear or get killed, it affects larger animals because they can no longer find enough food.[57] At least eleven people died in the country.[7] Since beginning of heavy rains on 15 January, 21,500 people were affected and over 3,900 acres of farmland was damaged or destroyed. According to preliminary satellite analysis by UNOSAT surveying the Sofala and Manica provinces, about 2,200\u00a0km2 of land appeared to be flooded, with Beira City, Buzi and Nhamatanda had the greatest number of people potentially exposed to flooding.[58] Furthermore, the rainfall affected 100,000 in Beira resettlement sites, which had been impacted by Cyclone Idai a year ago and Tropical Storm Chalane only a couple weeks before.[38] Temporary shelters such as tents and homes made from plastic sheeting were heavily destroyed by Eloise.[59] Some of the worst-hit areas, such as the Buzi District, outside of Beira, were already submerged by days of heavy rains ahead of the cyclone's landfall, with floodwaters consuming fields and flowing through village streets.[39] Large trees were uprooted and the entirety of Beira was covered by water by 23 January, while communication was eventually cut off.[60] Residents compared the impacts of the cyclone largely to that of Idai in 2019.[61] Prior to landfall, 4,000 households were affected by floods in Buzi, with another 266 in Nhamatanda, and 326 in Beira. The provinces of Inhambane, Manica, Niassa, Sofala, Tete, and Zambezia had already received between 200\u2013300\u00a0mm (7.9\u201311.8\u00a0in) of rain since 9 January. This was worsened after Eloise made landfall. Dams were brought to a tipping point, which raised concerns that they may worsen the flooding even more for the affected areas.[62] Advertising hoardings were blown over due to wind, and rivers burst through their banks in the region. The locals also expressed fear of losing crops, as floodwaters either damaged or destroyed farmland.[55] More than 5,000 homes in total were damaged across Buzi, Dondo, Nhamatanda, and Beira City, according to the government's preliminary data. Specifically, 1,069 were destroyed, 3,343 were damaged, and over 1,500 were flooded. Dozens of classrooms were damaged or destroyed, and at least 26[63] health centers were damaged. At least 177,000 hectares[64] of crops have been flooded, such as maize, rice, cassava, and others[9] (these numbers may rise after more data is collected).[45] Roads were rendered impassable in parts of the Sofala, Zambezi, Inhumane, and Manica Provinces. The amount of those affected in the country rose to 163,283 on 25 January, including 6,859 displaced. Assessments indicated that Sofala Province was the hardest hit, especially in the Buzi, Dondo, and Nhamatanda districts, as well as Beira City.[45] Due to the psychological effects of Idai's impact still persisting, mental support for the people affected was critical.[45] The storm displaced at least 8,000 individuals across the country.[3] Some humanitarian facilities were damaged.[9] Farm tools and seeds were destroyed.[63] On 27 January, an estimated 74 health centers and 322 classrooms were damaged or destroyed.[65] On 28 January, the number of houses affected rose to a total of 20,558. 6,297 were destroyed, 11,254 were damaged, and 3,007 were flooded.[64] The number climbed to 29,310 houses, with 17,738 destroyed, 8,565 damaged, and 3,007 flooded.

They are also focusing on responses to help mitigate gender-based violence.[61] At least 8,000 people were said to be displaced at the time.[3] Over 20 accommodation centers were opened for people to take shelter in.[71] This number then rose to 32.[63] IFRC Africa sent out nearly 360,000 swiss francs for a disaster relief fund to help affected families.[72] Nine Accommodation centres activated in Dondo and Muasa districts were deactivated by INGD. Food, tents, potable water, hygiene kits, and many other items were in critical need as the storm passed.[73][74] As many as 10 people were living inside of some emergency tents at one time. Over 8,700 people were living in 16 temporary shelters in the port of Beira, due to Eloise's damages. The United Kingdoms foreign office said on 26 January that they would donate \u00a31 million ($1.37 million) to help aid Mozambique's recovery. They also sent out a team of relief workers to assess damage and humanitarian needs.[74] The number of those affected were at 248,481 with 16,693 displaced, according to data released by the INGD, along with a total of 17,000 houses.[9] Flooding in the lower Limpopo river basin in the country was expected to peak around 26 or 27 January, according to the FCDO.[9] IOM provided soap and limited amounts of cloth face masks to the most vulnerable. They also attempted to give out information regarding to social distancing, but circumstances at the time proved it to be difficult.[63] Prime Minister Carlos Carlos Agostinho do Ros\u00e1rio visited the Sofala province on 25 January, and called on local residing in areas at risk of even more flooding to evacuate to safer grounds.[75] More than 90,000 children were affected.[6] Psychosocial support were also of high importance.[76] UNICEF handed out prepositioned basic household and hygiene items, water purification products, and tarpaulin sheets for up to 20,000 people.[65] On 29 January, the international aid organization Food for Hungry (FN) announced details of its response in Mozambique. It covered the districts Nhamatanda, Beira, and Dondo in the province of Sofala, and planned to serve 2,200 households immediately. They distributed much needed supplies for survivors, staff, and volunteers. FH's Mozambique Country Director, Judy Atoni, said they will be working with peer organizations to develop and implement long term humanitarian aid.[77] According to more preliminary data released by INGD on 28 January, the number of people affected still continued to rise as teams continued to survey damage, with the number standing at 314,369; a significant increase was reported in Buzi District. At least 20,012 people were still seeking shelter in 31 temporary accommodation shelters at the time (30 in Sofala, 1 in Inhambane). This was a slight decrease from 27 January, where 32 centers held 20,167 people.[66] GBV partners (UNFPA, Plan Int'l, IsraAid) distributed 782 dignity kits to evacuated and/or displaced women. A referral mechanism was put in place for urgent protection. The flooding in and around Buzi was comparable to an open sea.[78]  Some people tried building shelter after Idai in 2019 and have had their attempts damaged or destroyed. Oxfam called for international support immediately on 2 February, saying that any delay of any size could have disastrous consequences. At the time, they needed $3 million to provide clean water, sanitation, and hygiene support to 52,600 people in affected areas. They estimated over 260,000 people were in critical need of humanitarian aid.[79] Protection clusters have made sure that local leaders have ensured the presence of basic needs; such as toilets and disability and elderly support.[80] According to a report released on 3 February, preliminary satellite data found that approximately 1400\u00a0km2 of land appeared to be flooded. About 80,000 people were exposed and/or living near flooded areas during 14\u201331 January. At least 10,00 buildings were located within or were close to flooded areas.[81] Citizens claimed the crisis in Cabo Delgado Province, which began in 2017 and killed more than 2,000 Mozambicans, has been exacerbated due to flooding brought by the cyclone. The safety of women and young girls was at further risk of being damaged.[82]"

As the fourth tropical depression, third named storm, and second severe tropical storm of the season, Chalane developed out of a zone of disturbed weather which was first monitored RSMC La R\u00e9union on 19 December. Despite conditions slowly becoming unfavorable, the system formed into a tropical depression on 23 December due to the presence of a Kelvin wave and an equatorial Rossby wave, as well as warm sea surface temperatures. The depression soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Chalane on the following day. Chalane made landfall on Madagascar on 26 December and weakened, before emerging into the Mozambique Channel a couple days later. Subsequently, Chalane restrengthened, before making landfall on Mozambique on 30 December. The system weakened as it moved inland, degenerating into a remnant low later that day. However, Chalane's remnants continued moving westward for another several days, emerging into the South Atlantic on 3 January, before dissipating later that day. As Chalane strengthened, the coordinating of emergency supplies began in Madagascar, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). Late December 26, Chalane made landfall in Madagascar, causing flooding. But overall, there was little damage. Chalane was downgraded to a tropical depression as it passed through Madagascar. On 30 December, Chalane, now a Severe Tropical Storm, made impact on Mozambique, several institutions were damaged, but Chalane made less damage than expected. The same day, Chalane made landfall in Zimbabwe, before downgrading to a remnant low. The remnant has been causing some rainfall in neighboring countries. Overall, 7 people died in Mozambique and the damage toll of the storm is unknown, but was presumed to be minimal."

Chalane experienced low to moderate vertical wind shear and a good upper-level outflow.[3] Conditions began to deteriorate over the next several days as the system meandered to the west, however the storm managed to reach tropical depression status on 23 December as northerly wind-shear began to affect the storm causing most of the thunderstorm activity and winds to be localized to the south of the center.[4] Approximately a day later at 06:00 UTC 24 December, the depression strengthened to Moderate Tropical Storm Chalane as a scatterometer pass revealed gale-force winds on the southern side of the highly asymmetric wind field.[5] Since the storm was becoming aligned with the subtropical ridge, Chalane began to strengthen, with winds reaching 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) as wind shear decreased. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA).[6][7] At 21:00 UTC that day, the JTWC designated Chalane as Tropical Storm 07S.[8] However, Chalane continued to struggle from the effects of strong north-northeasterly wind shear. Chalane passed just to the south of Tromelin Island on 25 December where a pressure reading of 1,001.5\u00a0hPa (29.57\u00a0inHg) was recorded, indicating Chalane had likely weakened while also displaying a deteriorating cloud pattern, therefore Chalane was downgraded back to tropical depression status on 18:00 UTC that day.[9] Slowly, Chalane continued westward towards the Malagasy coastline as a tropical depression.[10] Convective activity remained disorganized while the center accelerated west up to landfall on 26 December at 18:00 UTC in Mahavelona, Madagascar.[11] Chalane degenerated into a surface trough shortly afterwards on 27 December, although its center still remained intact.[12] MFR ceased advisories at this time, as re-intensification was uncertain.[12] Chalane made its passage over Madagascar over the remainder of the day, before emerging over the Mozambique Channel on 28 December, where advisories resumed and Chalane re-developed into a tropical depression.[13] Six hours later, Chalane reintensified into a moderate tropical storm yet again, with the development of a curved band.[14] Chalane continued to strengthen with a central dense overcast bundled with the curved band becoming apparent on satellite imagery[15] Chalane gained severe tropical storm status at 06:00 UTC on 29 December with the formation of an eyewall.[16] Chalane continued to slowly gain strength while in its favorable environment, gaining peak strength 12 hours later with maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 983\u00a0hPa (29.0\u00a0inHg).[17] Shortly after peaking, Chalane made landfall north of Beira, Mozambique on 30 December and became subject to weakening.[18] Chalane degenerated into a remnant low later that day over Zimbabwe, as all thunderstorm activity had ceased, and the MRF issued their final advisory on the storm.[19] However, Chalane's remnants continued westward over the next several days,[20] emerging into the South Atlantic on 3 January, before dissipating shortly afterward."

Across the river is the larger Ontario town of the same name; the two cities are connected by the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge.

        "header": "Etymology",
        "content": "The city name was derived from the French term for the nearby rapids, which were called Les Saults de Sainte Marie. Sainte Marie (Saint Mary) was the name of the river and Saults referred to the rapids.\n(The archaic spelling Sault is a relic of the Middle French Period. Latin salta successively became Old French salte (c. 800 \u2013 c. 1340), Middle French sault, and Modern French saut, as in the verb sauter, to jump.) Whereas the modern saut means simply \"(a) jump\", sault in the 17th century was also applied to cataracts, waterfalls and rapids. This resulted in such place names as Grand Falls/Grand-Sault, and Sault-au-R\u00e9collet on the Island of Montreal in Canada; and Sault-Saint-Remy and Sault-Br\u00e9naz in France. In contemporary French, the word for \"rapids\" is rapides. Sault Sainte-Marie in French means \"the Rapids of Saint Mary\" (for a more detailed discussion, refer to the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario page). The Saint Mary's River runs from Lake Superior to Lake Huron, between what are now the twin border cities on either side. No hyphens are used in the English spelling, which is otherwise identical to the French, but the pronunciations differ. Anglophones say /\u02ccsu\u02d0 se\u026ant m\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0/ and Francophones say [so s\u025b\u0303t ma\u0281i]. In French, the name can be written Sault-Sainte-Marie. On both sides of the border, the towns and the general vicinity are called The Sault (usually pronounced /su\u02d0/), or The Soo."

They called the area Baawitigong (\"at the cascading rapids\"), after the rapids of St. Marys River. French colonists renamed the region Saulteaux (\"rapids\" in French). The Oc\u0323e\u1e6di \u1e60akowi\u019e came to call the Anishinaabe \"\u1e22a\u1e23a\u1e6du\u019ewa\u019e\", or \"Dwellers of the Falls.\" In 1668, French missionaries Claude Dablon and Jacques Marquette founded a Jesuit mission at this site. Sault Ste. Marie developed as one of oldest European cities in the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains, and the oldest permanent European settlement in Michigan.[5] On June 4, 1671, Simon-Fran\u00e7ois Daumont de Saint-Lusson, a colonial agent, was dispatched from Quebec to the distant tribes, proposing a congress of Indian nations at the Falls of St. Mary between Lake Huron and Lake Superior. Trader Nicolas Perrot helped attract the principal chiefs, and representatives of 14 Indigenous nations were invited for the elaborate ceremony. The French officials proclaimed France's appropriation of the immense territory surrounding Lake Superior in the name of King Louis XIV.[8] In the 18th century, the settlement became an important center of the fur trade, when it was a post for the British-owned North West Company, based in Montreal. The fur trader John Johnston, a Scots-Irish immigrant from Belfast, was considered the first European settler in 1790. He married a high-ranking Ojibwe woman named Ozhaguscodaywayquay, the daughter of a prominent chief, Waubojeeg. She also became known as Susan Johnston. Their marriage was one of many alliances in the northern areas between high-ranking European traders and Ojibwe. The family was prominent among Native Americans, First Nations, and Europeans from both Canada and the United States. They had eight children who learned fluent Ojibwe, English and French. The Johnstons entertained a variety of trappers, explorers, traders, and government officials, especially during the years before the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States.[9] For more than 140 years, the settlement was a single community under French colonial, and later, British colonial rule. After the War of 1812, a US\u2013UK Joint Boundary Commission finally fixed the border in 1817 between the Michigan Territory of the US and the British Province of Upper Canada to follow the river in this area. Whereas traders had formerly moved freely through the whole area, the United States forbade Canadian traders from operating in the United States, which reduced their trade and disrupted the area's economy. The American and Canadian communities of Sault Ste. Marie were each incorporated as independent municipalities toward the end of the 19th century.[10] As a result of the fur trade, the settlement attracted Ojibwe and Ottawa, M\u00e9tis, and ethnic Europeans of various nationalities. It was a two-tiered society, with fur traders (who had capital) and their families and upper-class Ojibwe in the upper echelon.[9] In the aftermath of the War of 1812, however, the community's society changed markedly.[9] The U.S. built Fort Brady near the settlement, introducing new troops and settlers, mostly Anglo-American. The UK and the US settled on a new northern boundary in 1817, dividing the US and Canada along St. Mary's River. The US prohibited British fur traders from operating in the United States. After completion of the Erie Canal in New York State in 1825 (expanded in 1832), the number of settlers migrating to Ohio and Michigan increased dramatically from New York and New England, bringing with them the Yankee culture of the Northern Tier. Their numbers overwhelmed the cosmopolitan culture of the earlier settlers. They practiced more discrimination against Native Americans and M\u00e9tis. The falls proved a choke point for shipping between the Great Lakes. Early ships traveling to and from Lake Superior were portaged around the rapids[11] in a lengthy process (much like moving a house) that could take weeks. Later, only the cargoes were unloaded, hauled around the rapids, and then loaded onto other ships waiting below the rapids. The first American lock, the State Lock, was built in 1855; it was instrumental in improving shipping. The lock has been expanded and improved over the years. In 1900, Northwestern Leather Company opened a tannery in Sault Ste. Marie.[12] The tannery was founded to process leather for the upper parts of shoes, which was finer than that for soles.[13] After the factory closed in 1958, the property was sold to Filborn Limestone, a subsidiary of Algoma Steel Corporation.[14] In March 1938 during the Great Depression, Sophia Nolte Pullar bequeathed $70,000 for construction of the Pullar Community Building, which opened in 1939. This building held an indoor ice rink composed of artificial ice, then a revolutionary concept. The ice rink is still owned by the city.[15]"

Marie is one of the snowiest places in Michigan, receiving an average of 120 inches (3.0\u00a0m) of snow per winter season, with a record year when 209 inches (5.3\u00a0m) fell. 62 inches (1.6\u00a0m) of snow fell in one five-day snowstorm, including 28 inches (71\u00a0cm) in 24 hours, in December 1995.  During this time, the city proper experienced a far greater level of snowfall than the farmlands past the canal and riverfront due to lake-effect snow.  This caused the 1437th MRBC National Guard local armory to be mobilized for disaster relief in order to remove hundreds of tons of snow which effectively blockaded people within their own homes.[18] Precipitation measured as equivalent rainfall, Sault Ste. Marie receives an annual average of 33 inches (840\u00a0mm). Its immediate region is the cloudiest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, having over 200 cloudy days a year.[citation needed] Temperatures in Sault Ste. Marie have varied between a record low of \u221236\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221238\u00a0\u00b0C) and a record high of 98\u00a0\u00b0F (37\u00a0\u00b0C). Monthly average temperatures range from 13\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221211\u00a0\u00b0C) in January to 64\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C) in July.[19] On average, only two out of every five years reaches 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C), while there are 85.5 days annually where the high remains at or below freezing and 26.5 nights with a low of 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) or colder. Average monthly precipitation is lowest in February, and highest in September and October. This autumn maximum in precipitation, unusual for humid continental climates, owes to this area's Great Lakes location. From May through July (usually the year's wettest months in most of the upper Midwestern United States, away from large bodies of water), the lake waters surrounding Sault Ste. Marie are cooler than nearby land areas. This tends to stabilize the atmosphere, suppressing precipitation (especially showers and thunderstorms) somewhat, in May, June and July. In autumn, the lakes are releasing their stored heat from the summer, making them warmer than the surrounding land, and increasingly frequent and strong polar and Arctic air outbreaks pick up warmth and moisture during their over-water passage, resulting in clouds and instability showers. In Sault Ste. Marie, this phenomenon peaks in September and October, making these the wettest months of the year. Also noteworthy is that in Sault Ste. Marie, the year's third wettest month, on average, is November, and not any summer month."

Altogether, the school provides 24 competitive sports teams for both boys and girls at all levels. \n[25] The school district also operates Malcolm High School as an alternative high school. Sault Ste. Marie has two middle schools, one in the Sault Ste. Marie School System known as Sault Area Middle School. Before the 6th grade annex was added in the late 1980s, the school was referred to as Sault Area Junior High School. The Second Middle School is a part of Joseph K. Lumsden Bahweting School, a Native American-affiliated Public School Academy. There are two elementary schools in Sault Ste. Marie, Lincoln Elementary and Washington Elementary. There is also a Public School Academy, Joseph K. Lumsden Bahweting School, and the St. Mary's Catholic School. Jefferson Elementary, McKinley Elementary, Bruce Township Elementary, and Soo Township Elementary (converted into an Alternative High School) have closed because of declining enrollment in the school system. St. Mary's Catholic School serves students in grades K\u20138. It is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette.[26] There is a Bureau of Indian Education-affiliated tribal school, Joseph K. Lumsden Bahweting Anishnabe School.[27] It was established in 1994 and received its current name in 1998.[28]"

The Lakers participate in NCAA Division I Ice Hockey and Division II Women's and Men's Basketball, Women's and Men's Golf, Women's Volleyball, Women's and Men's Track and Field, Women's and Men's Tennis and Women's and Men's Cross Country. Nicknamed the Lakers, LSSU's hockey program is celebrating its 59th season of intercollegiate competition. The team plays its home contests at Taffy Abel Arena (4,000 seats) on LSSU's campus and is one of the most decorated programs in NCAA hockey history. The squad claimed two NAIA titles in the early 1970s (1972, 1974), before a run of three NCAA Division I championships (1988, 1992, 1994) and one finalist appearance (1993) in the late 1980s and early 90s. In total, the Lakers have made 11 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament appearances. The Lakers compete in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). The rest of the athletic teams play in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC). The basketball programs at LSSU have seen their share of success. The Men's program won overall GLIAC regular season titles in 2014\u201315, 2013\u201314, 1995-1996 (Tournament Champion) and also claimed the north division crown in 2008\u201309. LSSU's women's program won GLIAC gold from 2001 to 2002 through 2004\u201305. They also captured GLIAC tournament titles in 2002-03 and 2003\u201304. Both Men's and Women's squads play their home games in the Bud Cooper Gymnasium within the Norris Center. Sault Ste. Marie is the home of the International 500 Snowmobile Race (commonly called the I-500), which takes place annually and draws participants and spectators from all over the U.S. and Canada. The race, which was inspired by the Indianapolis 500,[29] originated in 1969 and has been growing ever since."

        "content": "The city is home to the northern terminus of Interstate 75 (I-75), which connects with the Mackinac Bridge at St. Ignace approximately 50 miles (80\u00a0km) to the south, and continues south to near Miami. M-129 also has its northern terminus in the city. M-129 was at one time a part of the Dixie Highway system, which was intended to connect the northern industrial states with the southern agricultural states. Until 1984 the city was the eastern terminus of the western segment of US 2. County Highway H-63 (or Mackinac Trail) also has its northern terminus in the city and extends south to St. Ignace and follows a route very similar to I-75. The city is joined to its Canadian counterpart by the International Bridge, which connects I-75 in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Huron Street in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Commercial airline service is provided to the city by the Chippewa County International Airport in Kinross, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) south of the city. Smaller general aviation aircraft also use the Sault Ste. Marie Municipal Airport about one 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) southwest of downtown. Sault Ste. Marie was the namesake of the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway, now the Soo Line Railroad, the U.S. arm of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This railroad had a bridge parallel to the International Bridge crossing the St. Marys River. The Soo Line has since, through a series of acquisitions and mergers of portions of the system, been split between Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railway (CN). Canadian National operates the rail lines and the bridge in the Sault Ste. Marie area that were part of the Soo Line. The Sugar Island Ferry provides automobile and passenger access between Sault Ste. Marie and Sugar Island, formerly a center of maple sugaring. The short route that the ferry travels crosses the shipping channel. Despite the high volume of freighter traffic through the locks, freighters typically do not dock in the Sault. However, the city hosts tugs, a tourist passenger ferry service, and a Coast Guard station along the shoreline on the lower (east) side of the Soo Locks. The United States Postal Service operates a \"Marine Post Office\", situated within the locks, to service ships as they pass through. Shipping traffic in the Great Lakes system bypasses the rapids in the St. Marys River via the American Soo Locks. Locally, it is often claimed to be the world's busiest canal in terms of tonnage passing through it. The largest ships are 1,000 feet (300\u00a0m) long by 105 feet (32\u00a0m) wide. These are domestic carriers (called lakers). Smaller recreational and tour boats use the Canadian Sault Ste. Marie Canal. The lakers, being too large to transit the Welland Canal that bypasses Niagara Falls, are therefore land-locked. Foreign ships (termed salties) are smaller and can exit the Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River and the Atlantic Ocean."

In the Western United States, heavy snow, hail, and gusty winds affected many areas. This led to the partial closure of several major highways, including I-205 in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, as well as numerous fatal accidents on other highways. Hundreds of flights were cancelled, thousands of people lost power, and multiple sporting events were postponed. In the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley, significant impacts from severe weather occurred. A severe squall line produced destructive straight-line winds in the St. Louis metropolitan area on February 23. The most impactful day in terms of severe weather was on February 26, when a powerful line of severe thunderstorms containing damaging straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes impacted the Texas Panhandle, southern Kansas, and most of the state of Oklahoma. Dozens of instances of large hail, damaging wind gusts, and multiple tornadoes were confirmed with this event, including an EF2 tornado that killed a person in Cheyenne, Oklahoma. A 114\u00a0mph (183\u00a0km/h) wind gust from straight-line winds was reported in Memphis, Texas, which was the highest wind gust since the August 2020 Midwest derecho. Five of these tornadoes formed in the Oklahoma City metro area, including a high-end EF2 tornado that caused severe damage in the southeastern part of the city of Norman.[6] The event set the record for the most tornadoes ever recorded in Oklahoma in the month of February since modern records began in 1950.[7] More tornadoes touched down in Illinois the next day, including some in the Chicago metropolitan area. In addition to the severe weather impacts, parts of the Midwestern United States also received periods of heavy snowfall and gusty winds along with ice, causing dozens of accidents, knocking out power, and canceling hundreds of flights. The Northeastern United States was also affected by heavy snowfall."

        "content": "The threat for organized severe weather across Oklahoma and adjacent areas was first highlighted by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) nearly a week before the event, on February\u00a021 with a 15 percent risk area issued for the eastern Texas Panhandle, the western half of Oklahoma and much of Kansas.[135] The next day, as computer models began to exhibit greater consistency from run to run, a portion of the risk area was upgraded to a 30 percent risk area,[136] and subsequently to a level 3/Enhanced risk on the day 3 convective outlook.[137] The day before the event, this Enhanced risk was expanded northeastward toward Missouri and a level 4/Moderate risk was introduced across western Oklahoma, where increasing confidence caused forecasters to advertise the potential for a widespread damaging wind event.[138] On February\u00a026, the greatest risk area was again extended across much of Oklahoma, and the SPC also messaged the potential for a few strong/EF2+ tornadoes across southwestern portions of the state. The 1630 UTC day 1 outlook noted that a powerful derecho with embedded swaths of 80\u201a\u00c4\u00ec110 miles per hour (130\u201a\u00c4\u00ec180\u00a0km/h) straight-line winds was likely, along with embedded tornadoes \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including the risk for strong (EF2+) tornadoes \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and isolated instances of very large hail.[139] On the morning of February\u00a026, water vapor imagery depicted a well-defined and compact cold-core low progressing eastward across California and Nevada. A powerful shortwave trough accompanied this feature. Farther to the east, a warm front stretched from southern Louisiana across southern Texas, separating cooler and drier air to the north from a more unstable environment to the south. As low-level flow increased in advance of the cold-core low, southerly winds allowed that moist airmass to surge rapidly northward throughout the morning and afternoon hours.[140] Much of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, as well as western Oklahoma, experienced a four to eight degree increase in dewpoints within just a three-hour period. The meteorologists at the SPC noticed this and issued a Tornado Watch for parts of Texas and Oklahoma. The Tornado Watch was later expanded into central, northern and southern Oklahoma. Prior to the development of thunderstorms, strong wind fields already existed across the region, with bulk wind shear[note 1] topping 70 knots (80\u00a0mph; 130\u00a0km/h) and forecast to increase further.[142] As the evening approached, supercells developed in the Texas Panhandle, further organizing as a cold front overtook the preexisting dryline and contributed to greater focus for convective activity.[143] To the north, a complex line of storms developed near a 988 millibars (29.2\u00a0inHg) surface low in southwestern Kansas, where multiple tornadoes were reported.[144] With time, the originally discrete storms from the Texas Panhandle became intertwined with a solidifying squall line pushing eastward into Oklahoma. These storms entered an environment of richer moisture, with dewpoints into the low 60s \u00ac\u221eF northward to near I-40, and modest instability on the order of 500\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1,000 J/kg. Despite the presence of a capping inversion, strong forcing along the cold front was expected to erode inhibition, while low-level winds topping 70 knots (80\u00a0mph; 130\u00a0km/h) worked to assist in broad swaths of damaging winds. Favorable wind shear profiles supported embedded mesovortices and QLCS tornadoes within the line as the storm complex continued east.[145] Multiple tornadoes occurred in the Eastern Texas Panhandle and Western Oklahoma, including a high-end EF2 tornado that obliterated manufactured homes and killed one person at the western edge of Cheyenne. Several damaging QLCS tornadoes also ended up touching down throughout the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, including another high-end EF2 tornado that caused significant damage in southeastern Norman.[146][147] As storms entered eastern Oklahoma, they encountered a less favorable environment and weakened considerably, reducing the threat for severe weather with eastward extent into the pre-dawn hours of February 27, although scattered wind and tornado reports continued all the way into Missouri.[148] In all, 12 tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma; the day alone set the record for the most tornadoes ever recorded in Oklahoma during the month of February (the previous record was 6 in February of 1975 and 2009).[7] Over 100 reports of damaging straight-line wind gusts were received by the SPC, including multiple observations above hurricane-level windspeeds, peaking at 114\u00a0mph (183\u00a0km/h) in Memphis, Texas.[55] More than 76,000 people in Oklahoma lost power on the night of February 27, though it was restored for most by the following morning.[149] Amtrak's northbound Heartland Flyer was severely delayed due to debris on the tracks caused by the EF2 Norman tornado.[150]"

A 15 percent risk area was initially outlined for eastern Kentucky and eastern Tennessee on February 24.[151] The outlined area was given a slight risk the next day, thought weather data models began to show that ingredients for severe weather were shifting farther north towards the Ohio Valley region.[152] The slight risk was then shifted northwestward twice the subsequent day at both day 2 outlook times.[153] By the time the day 1 outlook was issued, the slight risk covered much of the Ohio Valley. While only moderate instability was in place, very strong wind shear and a discrete convective mode close to the surface low brought the possibility of both damaging winds and a few tornadoes in this area, with a 5% tornado risk area in place for much of Ohio, and a 2% tornado risk present farther west across Indiana and Illinois.[154] Later that day, multiple supercell thunderstorms developed in Illinois before they tracked eastward. Two EF0 tornadoes caused minimal damage in the Chicago suburbs of Plainfield and Naperville. Farther east in Indiana, a high-end EF1 tornado damaged the roof of a warehouse, snapped trees, and damaged or destroyed barns and outbuildings near McCordsville. In Ohio, another high-end EF1 tornado caused considerable damage to homes, trees, and outbuildings in and around Jacksonburg. An EF0 tornado overturned mobile homes and damaged abandoned farm structures at the Pickaway Correctional Institution near Orient. Several other weak tornadoes were also confirmed across all three states as well.[155]"

        "content": " The 1861 Atlantic hurricane season occurred during the first year of the American Civil War[1] and had some minor impacts on associated events. Eight tropical cyclones are believed to have formed during the 1861 season; the first storm developed on July 6 and the final system dissipated on November 3. Six of the eight hurricanes attained Category 1 hurricane status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, of which three produced hurricane-force winds in the United States. No conclusive damage totals are available for any storms.  Twenty-two people died in a shipwreck off the New England coast, and an undetermined number of crew members went down with their ship in the July hurricane. Based on maximum sustained winds, the first and third hurricanes are tied for the strongest of the year, although the typical method for determining that record\u2014central barometric air pressure\u2014is not a reliable indicator due to a general lack of data and observations. Four tropical storms from 1861 had been previously identified by scholars and hurricane experts, but three more were uncovered in modern-day reanalysis. Known tracks for most of the systems are presumed to be incomplete, despite efforts to reconstruct the paths of older tropical cyclones. Three systems completely avoided land.  They all had an effect on shipping, in some cases inflicting severe damage on vessels. A storm in September, referred to as the \"Equinoctial Storm\", hugged the East Coast of the United States and produced rainy and windy conditions both along the coast and further inland. The last storm of the season followed a similar track, and affected a large Union fleet of ships sailing to South Carolina for what would become the Battle of Port Royal. Two vessels were sunk and several others had to return home for repairs. Ultimately the expedition ended in a Union success."

        "content": "Prior to the advent of modern tropical cyclone tracking technology, notably satellite imagery, many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed, and storms that did affect land were not recognized until their onslaught. As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern-day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path. Judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location in relation to the storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in which three of the eight known storms in the 1861 season were identified by hurricane expert Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Partag\u00e1s's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partag\u00e1s also extended the known tracks of most of the other tropical cyclones previously identified by scholars. The information Partag\u00e1s and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete.[2][3] Although extrapolated peak winds based on whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1861, estimated minimum barometric air pressure listings are only present for the three storms that directly affected the United States.[4] Two hurricanes during the year made landfall on the mainland United States, and as they progressed inland, information on their meteorological demise was limited. As a result, the intensity of these storms after landfall and until dissipation is based on an inland decay model developed in 1995 to predict the deterioration of inland hurricanes.[3]"

A 1938 publication documented the storm's effects on Guadeloupe and St. Kitts, and given a lack of prior reports on the cyclone, modern-day reassessments concluded that it was relatively weak when it affected those islands.[5] After crossing the northern Leeward Islands, the tropical storm broadly curved toward the northwest, likely intensifying into the equivalence of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on July 9.[2] The majority of the storm's track in the western Atlantic was unknown until it was reconstructed based on reports from, and the effects on, three ships in its vicinity.[5] On July 10\u2014when the storm was approaching or at its peak intensity with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h)[2]\u2014the Bowditch encountered severe hurricane conditions which destroyed both of her masts and washed her entire crew overboard. Her captain was able to climb back aboard, where he survived for over a week with no food or water until he was rescued by a schooner. The Echo and Creole both sustained significant damage, and the crew and captain of the latter ship had to be rescued after she began taking on water. The extent of the damage to the three ships served as the basis for evaluating the storm's intensity in Partag\u00e1s's paper.[5] The hurricane ultimately passed between Bermuda and the United States before dissipating after July 12.[2]"

It is listed as having dissipated on August 17 in the northern Gulf.[2] The hurricane damaged or wrecked numerous vessels. Six ships were wrecked or grounded in the Bahamas, and the crews of at least two, the John Stanley and the Linea, had to be rescued. The steamship Santiago de Cuba left port on August 4, and began to encounter squally conditions later that afternoon. Heavy seas and a strong gale inflicted some damage on the vessel. Several ships along the eastern coast of Cuba were wrecked during the storm, leading to great uncertainty and concern regarding the fate of the Santiago. At least three vessels were lost or grounded along the Florida Keys.[7]"

Its track is only known through 1200 UTC on September 28.[2] Ludlum (1963) refers to the hurricane as the \"Equinoctial Storm\", and describes its area of impact as the \"entire coast\".[10] In the aftermath of the Battle of Carnifex Ferry in present-day West Virginia, Rutherford B. Hayes of the 23rd Ohio Infantry was camped south of the battle site, where he wrote about a \"very cold rain-storm\" in a September 27 letter to his wife Lucy. Conditions at the time were characterized by leaking tents and temperatures getting \"colder and colder\". Hayes wrote, \"We were out yesterday P.M. very near to the enemy's works; were caught in the first of this storm and thoroughly soaked. I hardly expect to be dry again until the storm is over.\"[11] Strong winds buffeted the Burlington, New Jersey, area from early evening to midnight on September 27, uprooting trees and causing some damage to property. Further north, Boston, Massachusetts, experienced intense winds and light rainfall for about five hours starting at midnight, with no initial reports of significant destruction.[9]"

The report was said to have been from October 16, but given her arrival date in New York City four days later and her location at the time of her encounter with the storm, she probably encountered the cyclone much earlier in the month. The violent south-southwesterly gale lasted 15 hours when the vessel was probably located at 20.5\u00b0N, 47\u00b0W. The storm was initially assigned a single set of coordinates for October 6, and no attempt was made to reconstruct its track due to a lack of certain data on it. However, it was noted that a ship further north on October 9 experienced a heavy gale.[12] Based on the likely correlation between the two ship reports, the storm's track was extended four days to late on October 9 in the Atlantic hurricane database.[3]"

        "content": "The Expedition Hurricane of 1861 [13] The final storm of the season followed a generally north-northeasterly course from the Gulf of Mexico northward along the U.S. East Coast between November 1 and November 3, dissipating over New England. The storm crossed southern Florida,[2] and based on observations from Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, and observations from the ship Honduras, it is believed to have attained hurricane intensity.[3] The hurricane made landfall in eastern North Carolina and proceeded up the coast before crossing eastern Long Island and coming ashore in southern New England. Its demise on November 3 marked the end of the 1861 Atlantic hurricane season; the next tropical storm would not form in the Atlantic until June 1862.[2] Two storm systems affected the region in the week following October 28, both of which influenced a Civil War expedition which was \"the largest fleet of war ships and transports ever assembled\".[14][15] The first storm, which is not recognized as a tropical cyclone, disrupted the initial assembly of the fleet on October 28. However, the fleet set sail the next day on its mission to attack Confederate forces (its destination was \"supposedly a military secret\"[14]). On November 2, the expedition encountered the second storm\u2014the tropical hurricane\u2014which wreaked havoc on the organization of the fleet and sunk two of its vessels. There was knowledge at the time of the series of storm systems, but few details on the condition and fate of the fleet, sparking great concern.[14] Some of the other ships were forced to return home for repairs, but the majority rode out the storm successfully.[16] The expedition proceeded onward and seized Port Royal Sound at the Battle of Port Royal. As described by Ludlum (1963), the hurricane is known as the Expedition Hurricane due to its influence on the fleet.[14] However, the hurricane also had a significant impact on land. Earlier in the year, Union forces had captured the fort guarding Hatteras Inlet at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries. In the early morning hours of November 2, high seas began to overwash Hatteras Island, \"completely covering all dry land except the position of the fort itself\".[14] After four hours, water began to subside. Extremely high tides associated with the cyclone continued up the coast as far north as Portland, Maine. Storm tides at various points, including New York City, Newport, Rhode Island, and Boston, reached levels unseen for at least 10 years and up to 46 years. In New York, the storm persisted for 20 hours starting early on November 2; rising waters inundated wharves along the East and Hudson Rivers. Floodwaters flowed up to five blocks inland, and a popular bar located in a hotel became isolated by the flooding. In response, a man transported customers to and from the bar on his private boat at a cost of two cents per ride.[17] Strong winds in Brooklyn brought down trees and telegraph wires.[17] Infrastructure throughout the Tri-State area suffered. Parts of the New Jersey Railroad line were undermined, and the Shore Line Railway at Bridgeport was inundated. Flooding was also prominent in the New Jersey Meadowlands and along the Newark Turnpike and Plank Road, which was left temporarily impassable. Further east, the hurricane triggered coastal flooding along the shores of Long Island, while northeasterly winds blew several ships ashore along the northern coast of Long Island. The eastern side of the hurricane blasted the southeastern New England coast between November 2 and November 3, damaging over 250 vessels at Provincetown, Massachusetts, and running aground 20 others. Water from the Massachusetts Bay surged into the village of Wareham. In downtown Boston, the storm began late on November 2 and lasted until late the next morning, although the highest tides did not occur until after conditions had already cleared. Twenty-two occupants of the ship Maritania drowned when the vessel sank after striking a rock during the worst of the storm. At the time, she was located 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) east of the Boston Light.[17]"

        "content": " Hurricane Arthur was the earliest known hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. state of North Carolina during the calendar year. It was also the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The first named storm of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Arthur developed from an initially non-tropical area of low-pressure over the Southeastern United States that emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean on June\u00a028. After sufficiently organizing, developing a well-defined circulation and deep convection amid a favorable environment, it was classified as a tropical depression on July\u00a01. The system continued to strengthen and was declared a tropical storm later that day. Drifting northward, the storm reached hurricane status early on July\u00a03 and curved toward the north-northeast. Further structural organization resulted in additional intensification, and by 01:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04, the system attained its peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) as a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Arthur made landfall at 03:15\u00a0UTC over North Carolina's Shackleford Banks, positioned between Cape Lookout and Beaufort, and intensified slightly further, with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 973\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.70\u00a0inHg). The storm then trekked swiftly northeast, weakening as it passed by Cape Cod and Nantucket, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone and coming ashore at Weymouth, Nova Scotia, on July\u00a05. The remnants continued generally northeastward through Atlantic Canada before ultimately dissipating on July\u00a09 over the Labrador Sea. Numerous tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for areas along the East Coast of the United States. A state of emergency was declared for 26\u00a0North Carolina counties, and both mandatory and voluntary evacuations were imposed along the state's coast. Several hundred government personnel were deployed to assist in evacuation and preparation efforts, along with heavy equipment capable of removing sand and debris. Due to the hurricane's timing, many Independence Day activities in the U.S. were cancelled or rescheduled. Damage was limited to strewn debris and inundated roads, and though 44,000\u00a0power outages were reported and widespread flooding occurred along northern sections of the coast, no deaths or serious injuries were reported. In New England, Arthur brought flash flooding and caused additional power outages, resulting in widespread road closures and suspension of ferry service. Losses in the country amounted to US$10\u00a0million. In Atlantic Canada and Quebec, hurricane-force gusts associated Arthur's remnants produced widespread damage. Countless trees and power lines fell across the region, leaving more than 300,000\u00a0without electricity. Damage to the power grid in Nova Scotia was regarded as the worst since Hurricane Juan in 2003. Efforts to restore and repair infrastructure were prolonged, with thousands still without power 10\u00a0days after the storm. Efforts to restore and repair damage to the electrical grid cost C$8.4\u00a0million (US$7.9\u00a0million). Reviews of Nova Scotia Power (NSP) and New Brunswick Power (NBP) were called upon due to numerous complaints from customers and politicians alike. A communication breakdown between NSP and the public exacerbated problems, and Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil condemned the company's response as \"inexcusable.\" Similarly severe impacts were felt by NBP which suffered a record-breaking C$23\u00a0million (US$21.6\u00a0million) in damage from the storm."

        "content": "On June\u00a025, 2014, an area of showers and thunderstorms developed over the northern Gulf of Mexico ahead of a shortwave trough in Texas.[1] That day, National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis off the Southeast United States over the following week as the system was expected to encounter favorable environmental conditions.[2] An area of low-level vorticity consolidated within the system on June\u00a026 as it moved northeast across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The following day it became intertwined with a frontal boundary over Georgia and South Carolina before emerging over the far western Atlantic Ocean early on June\u00a028.[1][3] An area of low-pressure soon formed within the system just off the coast of South Carolina.[1] Generally favorable environmental conditions fostered further organization of the low,[4] though convection remained minimal for several days.[5] During the latter half of June\u00a030, a United States Air Force weather reconnaissance mission into the system confirmed the presence of a well-organized circulation; however, displacement of showers and thunderstorms from its center delayed its classification.[6] Subsequent organization of convection into a banding feature along the system's southern flank, as depicted by radar imagery, prompted the NHC to designate the low as Tropical Depression One at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a01.[7] Situated 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) east-southeast of Fort Pierce, Florida, the newly christened depression moved slowly westward within an area of weak steering currents. A turn northward was forecast as a mid-level ridge built over the Atlantic.[1] Throughout July\u00a01, steady structural organization ensued. Around 15:00\u00a0UTC winds of 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h) were measured at Settlement Point on Grand Bahama, prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to a tropical storm and assign it the name Arthur.[8] Though environmental conditions surrounding the cyclone favored development, moderate wind shear and intrusions of dry air into the circulation prolonged organization.[9] The effects of the shear showed clearly on WSR-88D radar imagery from Melbourne, Florida which depicted a mid-level eye feature displaced 30 to 35\u00a0mi (48 to 56\u00a0km) from the low-level center.[10] By July\u00a02, Arthur acquired a steady northward track as previously forecast.[11] Throughout the day, convection consolidated around a developing eye as wind shear abated and the storm neared hurricane strength, with winds reaching 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h).[12] Early on July\u00a03, data from hurricane hunters flying in the storm indicated that Arthur attained hurricane-status about 190\u00a0mi (310\u00a0km) south-southwest of Cape Fear, North Carolina.[13][14] At this time, the hurricane began turning slightly to the north-northeast as it approached a weakness in the subtropical ridge ahead of a deep-layer trough over the Eastern United States.[13][15] Continued improvement of the storm's convective structure fostered intensification as the storm neared the North Carolina coastline.[16] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04, Arthur reached its peak winds of 100 mph, ranking it as a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[1][17] It was the first hurricane to reach such strength since Hurricane Sandy in the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm featured a well-defined 25 to 30\u00a0mi (40 to 48\u00a0km) wide eye at this time.[18] Thereafter, the hurricane made landfall at 03:15\u00a0UTC over the Shackleford Banks of North Carolina, located between Cape Lookout and Beaufort. Upon doing so, it became the earliest instance of a hurricane making landfall in the state during a calendar year, surpassing the previous record of July\u00a011 set by an unnamed hurricane in 1901.[1] Slight deepening of the cyclone occurred as it moved over Pamlico Sound, with its barometric pressure bottoming out at 973 mbar (hPa; 28.73\u00a0inHg).[19] Continuing across Pamlico Sound, Arthur's eye brushed the coastline of Dare County before striking just north of Oregon Inlet at 07:00 and 08:00\u00a0UTC, respectively.[1][20][21] After re-emerging over the Atlantic Ocean on July\u00a04 Arthur began to weaken. Though its eye remained well-defined, winds aloft in the storm failed to effectively mix down to the surface.[22] Traversing decreasing sea surface temperatures and amid increasing shear, Arthur began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day. Cloud tops associated with the system warmed and its structure became asymmetric. Reconnaissance continued to indicate strong flight-level winds of 119\u00a0mph (192\u00a0km/h) but surface winds at the time did not exceed 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph).[23] Accelerating ahead of the trough over the East Coast, Arthur's eye dissipated early on July\u00a05;[24] the storm passed within 75\u00a0mi (121\u00a0km) of Chatham, Massachusetts around 03:00\u00a0UTC.[25] Convection became increasingly displaced to the northeast as dry air entrained into the western portions of the circulation.[24] Surface winds decreased below hurricane-force by 06:00\u00a0UTC, and Arthur completed its conversion to an extratropical system at 12:00\u00a0UTC as it moved over the Bay of Fundy.[1] The NHC subsequently issued its final advisory on the storm and shifted warning responsibility to the Canadian Hurricane Centre.[26] The remnants of Arthur re-intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes; a sting jet with gusts of 65\u201380\u00a0mph (105\u2013129\u00a0km/h) developed along the storm's backside. The former hurricane made an additional landfall in the region near Fundy National Park by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[27] By July\u00a06, the sting jet had dissipated, and steady weakening of the cyclone resumed as only a split jet provided upper-level support to the storm.[28] Turning back to the northeast, Arthur moved through Labrador later that day.[29] Once over the Labrador Sea, Arthur turned northwest while weakening before doubling back to the southeast. After weakening below gale-force strength, the extratropical system dissipated late on July\u00a09.[1] Meteorologists noted to improved accuracy in the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting models in predicting the intensity and track of Hurricane Arthur.[30]"

        "content": "Multiple tropical cyclone warnings and watches were posted along the East Coast of the United States in advance of Arthur's impacts in Florida, the Carolinas, New England, and Atlantic Canada. Upon developing into a tropical cyclone early on July\u00a01, a tropical storm watch was issued in Florida from Fort Pierce to Flagler Beach. At 09:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the tropical storm watch was discontinued south of Sebastian Inlet, while another one was posted from the Santee River in South Carolina to Bogue Banks in North Carolina. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued for Oregon Inlet to the North Carolina\u2013Virginia state line. Later on July\u00a02, a tropical storm warning became in effect from the North Carolina side of the Little River Inlet to the state line with Virginia. Simultaneously, the tropical storm watch in Florida was removed.[1] At 21:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a02, a hurricane warning was posted in North Carolina from Surf City to Duck, including Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. Additionally, a tropical storm warning was issued from the Santee River to Surf City, while another one became in effect from Duck to Cape Charles Light in Virginia, including the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. A tropical storm warning was posted in Massachusetts at 21:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a03, stretching from Provincetown to Chatham along Cape Cod including Nantucket, in addition to a tropical storm watch between Port Maitland and Point Aconi issued by Environment Canada. Around 01:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04, the hurricane watch was discontinued south of Surf City, while the tropical storm warning was discontinued south of Little River Inlet. Two hours later, the tropical storm warning was canceled south of Cape Fear, North Carolina, and tropical storm watches in Canada were expanded to encompass New Brunswick from the Canada\u2013United States border to Grande Anse, including Cape Breton Island, and Prince Edward Island.[1] The tropical storm warning from Surf City to Cape Fear was discontinued at 05:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04. A few hours later, the portion of the hurricane warning south of Bogue Inlet was removed. At 09:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04, the tropical storm warning in Massachusetts was extended westward to Woods Hole. Around that time, areas west of Cape Lookout in North Carolina were no longer under a hurricane warning. In North Carolina, the hurricane warning was canceled for areas south of Ocracoke Inlet at 11:00\u00a0UTC. All hurricane warnings in the state were discontinued four hours later, as was the tropical storm warning at Albemarle Sound; in addition, all tropical storm watches issued by Environment Canada were then converted to tropical storm warnings. By 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Virginia, including the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, was discontinued. After passing by Nantucket and Cape Cod, the remaining tropical storm warnings in New England were rescinded.[1] Governor of North Carolina Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency for 25\u00a0counties in advance of the hurricane's arrival.[31] Fourteen shelters were opened, and the deteriorating North Carolina Highway\u00a012 Bonner Bridge was closed as a precaution.[32] Mandatory evacuations were declared for Hatteras Island and Richland Township in Beaufort County while voluntary evacuations were announced for Ocracoke Island, Aurora, Pamlico Beach, and Belhaven. Approximately 4,300\u00a0individuals fled from Ocracoke Island via ferry despite only being under a voluntary evacuation, and while a mandatory evacuation had been encouraged by Hyde County's emergency management director, other officials turned down the request.[33] Tornado watches were issued for 10\u00a0North Carolina counties.[34] In preparation for the possibility that Arthur's storm surge would make North Carolina Highway\u00a012 and Hatteras Island inaccessible, local officials deployed heavy equipment capable of removing sand and other debris.[35] To assist in storm preparations, 105\u00a0North Carolina National Guard members and 400\u00a0state highway patrol officers helped facilitate evacuations and storm preparations along the state's coastline.[35] Pamlico Sound ferry service was suspended,[32] and various Independence Day activities rescheduled. Meanwhile, in Ocean City, Maryland, a celebratory fireworks event was postponed to July\u00a05,[35] and in Boston, a Fourth of July Boston Pops concert and fireworks display were rescheduled to July 3.[34] Fireworks displays were also postponed throughout Rhode Island.[36] National Weather Service and Coast Guard officials warned of the potential for rip currents along the East Coast resulting from Arthur.[37] The National Park Service-operated Wright Brothers National Memorial and Cape Lookout National Seashore were closed in anticipation of the storm.[38] Several airlines waived change fees for travelers in areas affected by Arthur.[39] Officials at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent more than 54\u00a0aircraft to Dayton, Ohio to prevent the occurrence of potential wind damage.[40] In Nantucket, Massachusetts, a school was converted to a temporary shelter in anticipation of Arthur's arrival.[41] In anticipation of Arthur's arrival, Nova Scotia Power prepared and collected resources in case of power outages and other impacts in the region.[42] Numerous weekend events were called off throughout the Canadian Maritimes, including the Stan Rogers Folk Festival.[43] Multiple boat-owners and fisherman took extra precautions by battening down hatches and tying extra lines to wharves to keep ships and boats from coming loose in the storm. Environment Canada officials issued high wind warnings in addition to earlier tropical storm warnings for the Maritimes and considered imposing rainfall warnings for western portions of Prince Edward Island as well. Province-managed parks in Nova Scotia, including beaches and camping grounds, were shut down prior to Arthur's arrival, and several airlines waived transfer fees.[44] Officials in Moncton stated that city personnel would be prepared to respond to potential issues caused by Arthur, such as flooding or fallen trees, while the Canadian Red Cross readied volunteers in case of the need for emergency assistance. The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station took precautionary measures against the storm, with Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission employees deployed to the site.[45]"

        "content": "Hurricane Arthur was the earliest recorded landfalling North Carolina hurricane,[55] coming onshore at 03:15\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04. At Cape Lookout, a peak wind gust of 101\u00a0mph (163\u00a0km/h) and 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h) were recorded. A United States Coast Guard station in Cape Hatteras observed a peak gust of 91\u00a0mph (146\u00a0km/h).[1] An EF1 tornado touched down in Duplin County, damaging two structures and many trees, while a funnel cloud was sighted within the vicinity of Elm City.[32][56] Another EF1 tornado was reported in Martin County, which knocked a tree onto a house. The highest rainfall total measured as a result of Arthur in North Carolina, 4.20 inches (107\u00a0mm), was recorded at Kinston. High tides were reported along the coast, with a peak storm surge of 4.5\u00a0ft (1.4\u00a0m) at Oregon Inlet.[57] Arthur caused power outages impacting at least 44,000\u00a0customers,[58] of which 16,500\u00a0were in Carteret County; another 1,000\u00a0outages each occurred in Craven and New Hanover counties.[32] As a result, Duke Energy deployed over 500\u00a0personnel to restore electrical service,[58] while Tideland EMC handled more than 2,000\u00a0outages in Pamlico, Hyde and Craven counties.[32] Strong winds toppled trees and power poles in Hyde County and Ocracoke Island,[59] and flooding occurred just south of downtown Wilmington, North Carolina.[34] On other areas along the coast, flood waters reached 3 to 6 feet (0.91 to 1.83\u00a0m) deep;[40] with widespread coastal erosion observed in many areas.[60] Meanwhile, at Wrightsville Beach, the hurricane tore off shingles and partially defoliated palm trees,[61] and in Manteo, 6 to 8 inches (150 to 200\u00a0mm) of water inundated several businesses. Nearby, Kill Devil Hills experienced flooding to numerous residences and roads.[60] Copious rainfall and strong winds were reported along the Outer Banks; at least one additional county was added to the North Carolina's state of emergency declaration, and while officials in Dare County initially intended to cut off access to the county while potential destruction was being surveyed, the curfew ended just after sunrise. Emergency officials announced the intention to begin damage assessments throughout the state as sunrise approached and Arthur departed the region.[62] After experiencing a \"communication failure\" with Ocracoke Island officials, a generator and communication equipment were delivered via ferry there.[63] North Carolina Highway\u00a012, the only road linking Hatteras Island to the mainland, remained closed after Arthur's passage, covered under water and sand.[64] The repair cost for the road was less than $1\u00a0million.[65] In Manteo, parts of U.S. Route\u00a064 were shut down due to flooding,[61] and northern portions of the North Carolina coastline also experienced significant flooding.[66] Few flight cancellations were made necessary by Arthur's approach along the East Coast, as the storm's impacts were primarily offshore, and damage was limited to strewn debris and inundated roads.[61] Overall, damage along the North Carolina shoreline was slight, and no fatalities or severe injuries were recorded.[61] Throughout the county a total of 161\u00a0structures sustained damage, 16\u00a0of which had major damage, while none were destroyed.[67] Damage in North Carolina amounted to $2.35\u00a0million, almost entirely in Dare County alone.[68] The low damage across the state was largely due to the storm's fast motion.[65]"

        "content": "Owing to Arthur's somewhat large size, strong winds and light rains impacted portions of the Delmarva Peninsula. In Virginia, sustained winds peaked at 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) at Rappahannock Light with gusts up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). Tropical storm force winds were mostly confined to coastal areas of Delaware and Maryland. Maximum storm surge was 2.38\u00a0ft (0.73\u00a0m) in Money Point, Virginia and 2.34\u00a0ft (0.71\u00a0m) in Lewes, Delaware. Notable storm tides also occurred in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York, peaking at 3.49\u00a0ft (1.06\u00a0m) in Bridgeport, Connecticut.[1] Sustained winds of 49\u00a0mph (79\u00a0km/h) and gusts to 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) were reported near Nantucket Island in Massachusetts as Arthur passed just offshore.[1] Flooding was reported within the vicinity of Broad and Easy streets on Nantucket Island, and heavy rains induced widespread flooding elsewhere as well,[41] with up to 8.00 inches (203\u00a0mm) of rain measured at New Bedford, 7.20 inches (183\u00a0mm) at Plymouth, and 6.26 inches (159\u00a0mm) at Fairhaven.[69] The accumulation at New Bedford ranked Arthur as the ninth wettest tropical cyclone on record in the state.[70] Massachusetts State Police shut down access to parts of Interstate 195, Massachusetts Route 18, and U.S. Route 6 as a precaution. Nearby in Fairhaven, Adams Street was inundated and inaccessible,[41] while the heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding at New Bedford; as a result, a flash flood emergency was imposed by the National Weather Service. In addition, ferry service to and from Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket was suspended.[71] Minor flooding also led to road closures around Boston, including the Interstate 93 tunnel near Leverett Circle. The New Bedford Whaling Museum was also flooded, inundated under 20 inches (510\u00a0mm) of water. Several boats were beached, and some flooding occurred at Cape Cod. NSTAR reported 8,451\u00a0outages, 7,500\u00a0of them on Cape Cod, while National Grid recorded 1,900, of which 1,400 affected customers in Middlesex County.[72] Moisture from Arthur also aided in the development of damaging thunderstorms across western Massachusetts. Total losses in the state amounted to $889,000.[73] Heavy rain forced a postponement of a game between the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles.[74] In Maine, tropical storm-force wind gusts downed numerous trees and power lines across eastern portions of the state. Winds on the mainland gusted to 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) while Machias Seal Island observed 71\u00a0mph (114\u00a0km/h).[1][75] Outages in Maine affected 20,000\u201325,000\u00a0residences, primarily in Hancock and Washington counties.[75] About 2,800\u00a0Central Maine Power customers and 4,390\u00a0Emera Maine patrons lost power, mostly due to overturned trees and branches throughout the state.[76] Locally significant damage took place in Aroostook County where heavy rains enabled winds aloft to mix down to the surface.[75] Alongside the winds heavy rainfall affected the state, with a maximum of 6.48 inches (165\u00a0mm) near Whiting.[1] Effects from the rains were negligible, with only minor stream flooding reported in Hancock and Washington Counties.[75] Further inland in Vermont, 1,600\u00a0customers lost power.[77]"

In New Brunswick, power outages affected upwards of 140,000\u00a0individuals, of which 52,000\u00a0were situated near Fredericton, forcing the closure of the local University of New Brunswick campus.[80] Copious rainfall was recorded in southwestern parts of New Brunswick, with 5.91\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) measured at Gagetown.[1] Flooding at Saint John, New Brunswick made two local streets inaccessible, while winds downed electrical poles in Fredericton. In Onslow, Nova Scotia, firefighters rescued a man trapped under a tree limb, while a sailboat capsized at Charlottetown harbor and another was washed out to sea.[80] The hurricane forced temporary suspension of the MV Nova Star ferry service between Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and Portland, Maine.[76] The storm caused flight delays and cancellations at Halifax Stanfield International Airport, while LaHave and Tancook Island ferries were shut down; in addition, access to the A. Murray MacKay Bridge was restricted to smaller vehicles.[81] In Stratford, Prince Edward Island, a woman died after being struck by a door that was caught by a gust of wind,[82] and in Woodstock, New Brunswick, a man died when his oxygen support was cut off during a power outage.[83] In some parts of Nova Scotia, damage to the electrical grid was reported to be the worst since Hurricane Juan in 2003.[84] Damage throughout New Brunswick amounted to at least C$12.6\u00a0million (US$11.8\u00a0million).[85] Effects from Arthur extended as far away as Quebec, where topographic wind enhancement occurred. Gusts of 50 to 62\u00a0mph (80 to 100\u00a0km/h) affected the Gasp\u00e9sie\u2013\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine region.[78] Locally heavy rains fell in some parts of the province, with maximum amounts reaching 3.1\u00a0in (80\u00a0mm).[86] The heaviest damage took place along the Chaleur Bay.[78] Numerous trees and power lines were downed by the storm, leaving 23,000\u00a0Hydro Qu\u00e9bec customers without electricity. A portion of Quebec Route 132 near Carleton-sur-Mer was temporarily shut down due to fallen debris.[87] Severe flooding impacted Mont-Louis, with 40\u00a0homes affected, culverts washed away, and roads rendered impassable. A portion of Quebec Route 198 near the area was washed away. In nearby Marsoui, water and sewer service was disrupted with damage estimated in excess of C$4\u00a0million (US$3.75\u00a0million).[88]"

        "content": "If this is the most reliable infrastructure in the history of this company, I'd hate to see when it was vulnerable. Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil, July\u00a011, 2014[89] Power outages across Nova Scotia lasted for a week after the storm's passage.[89] This prompted numerous complaints from residents and officials, both criticizing NSP for their slow response. On July\u00a09, NSP President and CEO Bob Hanf issued a public apology for the communication breakdown between his company and customers.[91] By July\u00a011, 2,400\u00a0customers remained without electricity with 187\u00a0crews working to restore it. The delay in restoration prompted numerous complaints from residents and Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil condemned NSP's response as \"inexcusable.\" McNeil ordered a review of the company to be made by provincial regulators. He and Energy Minister Andrew Younger agreed that there was a total failure of communication, namely through their website, between NSP and residents. One resident in Annapolis Valley stated that the company continuously told her power would be restored soon, when it ultimately took five days for it to return. NSP stated that in the four years prior to Arthur, C$70\u00a0million (US$65.7\u00a0million) had been spent on improving the electrical infrastructure; however, the storm was of a severity beyond any other since Hurricane Juan.[89] Similar issues occurred in New Brunswick where 18,000\u00a0customers remained without power through July\u00a011. More than 310\u00a0crews remained deployed throughout the province with electricity expected to be fully restored by the following week. Costs to repair the power grid were estimated in excess of C$12\u00a0million (US$11.3\u00a0million). There was criticism that New Brunswick Power did not appropriately prepare for the storm and actually requested assistance from other public power companies and private contractors after the storm had struck. Two public buildings in Fredericton were utilized as recharging centers for residents to charge their phones and shower. An estimated 6,000\u00a0people took advantage of this through July\u00a010. Shaved ice was later distributed from the Grant-Harvey Centre in the city while several waste disposal sites were opened for residents to get rid of spoiled food from power outages.[92] Ga\u00ebtan Thomas, president and chief executive officer of NB Power, likened the effects of Arthur in the region to Hurricane Katrina along the United States Gulf Coast in August\u00a02005. He referenced that during Katrina, 50 percent of the affected region lost power, while in the wake of Arthur 57 percent of New Brunswick was in the dark over a similar geographic area. Earlier cuts to the company's tree-trimming budget were cited as a possible cause in the scale of damage. As such, their budget for trimming in 2015 was increased from C$6\u00a0million to C$8\u00a0million.[93] Emergency management officials in Fredericton stated that it could be years before the city fully recovered from the storm. Power restoration in the province reached over 99 percent on July\u00a016 with only 750\u00a0customers still out. However, a thunderstorm that evening revealed the weak nature of the power grid as outages jumped back over 4,000.[94] The following week, Energy Minister Craig Leonard rebutted claims that a public review of NB Power was necessary, despite the longevity and severity of the power outages. New Brunswick's Liberal and Green parties both supported an independent review of the company, while Leonard claimed only an internal review was necessary.[95] The total cost to restore and repair damage to the power grid wrought by the storm amounted to C$8.4\u00a0million (US$7.9\u00a0million). This ranked it as the second-costliest event for Nova Scotia Power from a tropical cyclone, only behind Hurricane Juan.[96] New Brunswick Power reported even greater losses from Arthur with damage amounting to C$23\u00a0million (US$21.6\u00a0million). This marked the costliest disaster in the company's history, surpassing the December 2013 ice storm.[97] In light of the severe damage, NB Power allocated an extra C$5.1\u00a0million (US$4.8\u00a0million) for tree trimming during the 2014\u20132014 fiscal year.[98] By July\u00a09, 11\u00a0municipalities across Quebec were declared disaster areas and made eligible for federal funding.[88] Ten more municipalities were placed under this declaration on July\u00a011 following further damage assessments.[86] The Canadian Red Cross provided residents in Marsoui with food and aid.[88] Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard allocated C$100,000 in aid for the affected areas and promised further funding.[99] A few weeks after the storm, a severe outbreak of fire blight, a bacterial infection, occurred in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, affecting as many as 80 percent of the Valley's apple orchards. The storm was blamed for causing microscopic cracks in leaves, which allowed airborne bacteria to enter the plants.[100]"

Washington Governor Jay Inslee sought funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for damages caused during the prolonged stormy period, including for the Port Orchard tornado.[2] There was not a tornado warning issued for the storm that produced the tornado.[8] The Storm Prediction Center placed the Kitsap Peninsula and nearby Olympic Peninsula under a risk for general thunderstorms for the day, but did not note a chance of severe thunderstorms for the region.[9] The storm was a product of the Olympic Mountain velocity shear zone, a meteorological phenomenon that occurs when an incoming onshore flow in usually in the wake of a cold front from the Pacific Ocean is forced around the Olympic Mountains and adds the needed low-level wind shear that can enhance rotating storms moving through the area. Velocity scans show that this storm had mesoscale rotation to about 10,000 feet and rotation could be seen by the Langley Radar on Camano Island Doppler weather radar imagery.[8]"

Some of the most intense damage was inflicted to a dry storage facility, which sustained roof loss and collapse of numerous walls. A strip mall sustained considerable damage as well.[10][1] About twenty homes were initially evacuated because of fears of a gas leak.[4] Several roads were closed after the event, both because of debris on the roads and to limit access to damaged neighborhoods.[11] Shelters were also opened to help victims affected by the storm.[12]"

The heaviest snow fell in parts of Minnesota where 9\u00a0inches (22.5\u00a0cm) of snow was reported in St. Louis County, Minnesota.[5] Heavy snow and blizzard conditions also occurred in North Dakota, southwestern Manitoba and southeastern Saskatchewan. The non-tropical cyclonic storm generated wind speeds of up to 70\u00a0mph, caused by a severe low pressure zone over Nebraska on October 24.[6] Akron, Cleveland, Findlay, Marion, Lorain, Mansfield, Toledo, Wooster and Youngstown, Ohio all witnessed heavy winds on the 24th.[7] Severe weather battered Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio on the 25th and 26th of October, producing strong winds, rain, hail, and widespread tornadoes. It was the region's second strongest storm on record.[6] The weather station in Bigfork, Minnesota, recorded a state record atmospheric pressure of 955.2 millibars (28.21\u00a0inches of pressure), typical of a Category 3 hurricane.[8] The National Weather Service reported that a tornado with a maximum speed of 115\u00a0mph touched down about four miles east of Peotone in Will County, south of Chicago, that morning and traveled 2.9 miles, causing downed power lines and partially destroying a home. Another tornado was reported to have landed in Racine, Wisconsin.[6] Heavy damage was reported in the Chicago area, particularly in Kane, Will, Kankakee, and Iroquois Counties in Illinois and in Porter County in Indiana. The winds flipped single engine planes on their sides at DuPage Airport in West Chicago, and flights were delayed by 30 minutes at O'Hare and Midway airports.[6] More than 300 flights were canceled at O'Hare International Airport, and more than 60,000 ComEd customers were without power. Several other less powerful tornadoes also occurred in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Heavy snow also fell in south western Ontario. There were no fatalities with this system.[6] A GOES satellite image on October 26 showed what could be considered the eye of the storm over the Minnesota-Ontario border, with outlying clouds reaching as far as Alberta, southern Nunavut, Newfoundland, eastern Montana, Colorado, Louisiana, Maine, and Bermuda.[8] The storm developed so quickly, that it was declared to be a weather 'bomb', which is an extremely fast developing storm that drops at least one millibar of pressure per hour for 24 hours\u2014a phenomenon more commonly seen over water than land.[8] On the morning of October 26, a serial derecho caused widespread damage in Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio Tuesday. Louisville, Ky; Cincinnati, Cridersville, and Toledo, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee[9] Indianapolis were hit at 9 am CDT, and Detroit was hit during the midday and early afternoon hours. Other cities impacted by the storms included Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Buffalo, New York, and Charleston, West Virginia.[9] At one point in the morning a line of tornado warnings stretched from central Michigan down to northern Mississippi. Tornado damage to homes was also reported in and around Peotone, Illinois, and Kokomo, Indiana, while another tornado reportedly uprooted and downed trees onto homes near Racine, Wis.[9] On October 28, the storm system left the East Coast. During the next few days, the system moved eastward across the Atlantic, before stalling over the western Mediterranean on November 1.[10] On November 5, the system dissipated over the western Mediterranean region.[10]"

It became the first storm to make a major landfall in Nampula Province in Mozambique since Cyclone Jokwe in 2008. The eighth tropical storm, fourth tropical cyclone and fourth intense tropical cyclone of the 2021\u201322 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gombe originated from a tropical disturbance located off the coast of Madagascar. This area of convection was designated by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center as Invest 97S on 6 March. The next day, it began to slowly move westward and executed a loop as it became more organized, which prompted M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France Reunion (MFR) to note the system as Zone of Disturbed Weather 09. The system became a depression on 9 March, and became a moderate tropical storm the same day. Soon after being named, Gombe made landfall in Madagascar, and entered in the Mozambique Channel the next day. The storm continued its westward motion while slowly intensifying, and was upgraded to a Tropical Cyclone by the MFR on 10 March. Closing in on Nampula Province, the storm underwent rapid intensification, and was upgraded to the fourth Intense Tropical Cyclone of the year and reached its peak intensity on 11 march, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 960 hectopascals (28\u00a0inHg). The storm proceeded to make landfall, and quickly lost its convection over land. On 12 March, Gombe degenerated into a remnant low overland. However, the system subsequently turned southeastward and reemerged over water, before briefly regenerating into a tropical depression on 17 March. Gombe dissipated later that day. Cyclone Gombe killed 72 people across three countries: 63 in Mozambique, 7 in Malawi, and 2 in Madagascar. Tens of thousands of homes were heavily damaged by the storm in Mozambique, and left hundreds of thousands of families without power across Nampula. Gombe affected thousands of hectares of crops, dropped 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) of rain in 24 hours. The Island of Mozambique also experienced some damage from the storm."

[nb 1]The JTWC followed suit, and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 19S at 18:00 UTC that day.[4][5] On 8 March, Gombe made landfall in the Sava Region of Madagascar, and the MFR downgraded the system to an overland depression at 06:00 UTC while it crossed the country,[6] and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression as well.[7] 24 hours later, the system reached the Mozambique Channel, moving westward at 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), and the MFR upgraded it back to a tropical storm at 06:00 UTC on 9 March, with 10-minute sustained winds of 45 knots (83\u00a0km/h; 52\u00a0mph).[8] Gombe, driven by a subtropical ridge south of the Channel, continued to move westward, and the MFR observed an improved cloud pattern, upgrading it to a Tropical Cyclone at 06:00 UTC on 10 March, estimating maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph).[9] Gombe then began a period rapid intensification, and the MFR upgraded the storm to Intense Tropical Cyclone, with peak 10-minute sustained winds of 90 knots (170\u00a0km/h; 100\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 960 hPa (28.34 inHg) midnight on 11 March.[10] At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 100 knots (190\u00a0km/h; 120\u00a0mph), which made it a Category 3 cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale - the storm strengthened approximately 35 knots (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph) within 18 hours.[11] The storm made landfall in Nampula Province of Mozambique, the first major cyclone to do so since Cyclone Jokwe of 2008, and subsequently weakened significantly.[12] The MFR downgraded the storm to an Overland Depression for the second time on 06:00 UTC the same day, with the JTWC tagging the system as a high-end Category 1-equivalent.[13][14] The storm continued to move inland into Mozambique, and the MFR issued their last advisory on Gombe a day later, and the JTWC issued their final advisory at 18:00 UTC on 12 March.[15][16]\nIn the advisory released on 17 March by the MFR, what was left of Gombe reorganized itself into a tropical depression as its entered Mozambique channel. However, later that same day, the MFR issued their final advisory on Gombe.[17]"

In Zambezia Province, the bridge connecting the administrative posts of Mulela and Nabur to the village of Pebane collapsed.

The sixth tropical disturbance, the second tropical cyclone, and the second intense tropical cyclone of the 2021\u201322 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Emnati formed from a zone of disturbed weather that was first noted on 15 February 2022. It continued westward, and steadily intensified before getting named Emnati a day later. Due to present dry air and wind shear, the storm had struggled to intensify significantly, and it became a category 1-equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson Scale later. After it managed to close off its core from prohibiting factors, the storm quickly intensified into a category 4-equivalent days later, forming a small eye around its CDO. Emnati then underwent a lengthy eyewall replacement cycle, which strongly weakened the storm as it moved closer to Madagascar. Eventually, it weakened back to a category 1-equivalent cyclone before making landfall in the country."

It cruised west, and eventually made landfall in Madagascar as a Category 3-equivalent storm. While Batsirai impacted Madagascar, Moderate Tropical Storm Cliff quickly formed but stayed out to sea. Continuing the active period of development, Tropical Storm Dumako formed, struggling to intensify and making landfall in Madagascar later. Yet another storm, Cyclone Emnati, would strike extreme southern Madagascar as a Category 1-equivalent after peaking as a Category 4-equivalent beforehand. The third Intense Tropical Cyclone, Cyclone Vernon, passed into the basin as a Category 4-equivalent after very rapidly intensifying in the neighboring Australian region. The fourth Intense Tropical Cyclone, Gombe, formed off the coast of Madagascar on 5 March. Initially, the storm struggled to intensify beyond tropical storm status. After hitting Madagascar, Gombe emerged into the Mozambique Channel and rapidly intensified to a Category 3-equivalent cyclone. It then struck Mozambique, bringing heavy rainfall to the same area which Ana had hit a few weeks ago. After Gombe, Halima formed in the northeast of the basin on 21 March. It gradually intensified to an Intense Tropical Cyclone on 25 March, before dissipating later on 1 April. After, Subtropical Depression Issa formed just off the eastern coast of South Africa, an extremely rare phenomenon. It proved itself to be damaging and very deadly, killing hundreds due to catastrophic flooding. Finally, Jasmine formed near Comoros on 21 April before the landfall in Nampula and Zambezia province off the coast of Mozambique and rapidly intensified as Severe Tropical Storm. The storm made landfall in Toliara before it rapidly weakening to an overland depression, and dissipated on 27 April. In early May, Karim formed. Karim did not affect land and entered the Australian region on 7 May."

The JTWC followed, upgrading Gombe to a tropical storm with winds of 35\u00a0kn (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph) at 18:00 UTC on 7 March.[104][105] The MFR re-classified Gombe as an overland depression at 06:00 UTC as it made landfall in northern Madagascar on 8 March,[106] and the JTWC downgraded the storm to a tropical depression.[107] 24 hours later, Gombe emerged over the Mozambique Channel, and strengthened back to a tropical storm.[108] Gombe gradually re-developed its structure, and then intensified to a high-end tropical storm late on 9 March, and gained Category 1-equivalent winds by 06:00 UTC on 10 March.[109] As it neared landfall on Nampula Province, it underwent rapid intensification and strengthened from 65 to 100\u00a0kn (120 to 185\u00a0km/h; 75 to 115\u00a0mph) in 18 hours.[110] The MFR upgraded Gombe to the fourth Intense Tropical Cyclone of the year at the same time.[111] Following Gombe's landfall in Mozambique, it proceeded to lose most of its convection the next day. The MFR downgraded the storm to an Overland Depression for the second time on 06:00 UTC on 11 March.[112] In the technical bulletin released on 17 March by the MFR, the agency noted that what was left of Gombe reorganized itself into a tropical depression in the Mozambique channel.[113] Later that day, however, the MFR issued their final bulletin on the storm. Mozambique was particularly hard-hit by Gombe, with approximately 736,000 people directly affected. A total of 63 people died and 108 others were injured in the country.[114]"

With warm ocean temperatures and low wind shear, the low developed intense thunderstorms which wrapped around a tight circulation, and dropped heavy rainfall in eastern South Africa. On 12\u00a0April, the MFR designated the low as Subtropical Depression Issa, based on the system's structure and the presence of gale-force winds. Issa moved slowly to the south at first,[120] strengthening to reach 10-minute sustained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) late on 12\u00a0April. At its peak, the storm had an eye-like feature in the middle of a symmetrical area of thunderstorms.[121] On 13 April, the JTWC classified this system as a subtropical storm in an unofficial bulletin.[122] Issa turned to the north back toward the South African coast due to the trough in the region.[123] Increased wind shear and dry air stripped away the thunderstorms near the center, weakening the storm, and causing the MFR to discontinue advisories on 13\u00a0April.[124] Issa exacerbated catastrophic floodings in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, that killed 435 people.[125][126]"

It peaked as a Severe Tropical Storm with windspeed of 110\u00a0km/h according to MFR whereas the JTWC estimated a slightly lower windspeed of 100\u00a0km/h.[131] Soon reaching its peak intensity, it began to encounter low sea surface temperatures as well as high wind shear and baroclinic forces which commenced its weakening. With the same intensity on 26 April, the storm made landfall at Toliara and the MFR downgraded it into an overland depression.[132] On 27 April 2022, the MFR released a final bulletin, informing that Jasmine had lost its tropical characteristics and was downgraded to a low pressure common on the high seas.[133] As a result of Jasmine, three people have died, and seven more have been reported missing.[134]"

However, it is the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar who name the systems. The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center (Mauritius Meteorological Services) in Mauritius names a storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55\u00b0E and 90\u00b0E. If instead a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 30\u00b0E and 55\u00b0E then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center (Madagascar Meteorological Services) in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. Storm names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with any names that have been used automatically removed. Therefore, all storm names used this year will be removed from the rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2024\u201325 season, while the unused names will remain on the list.[146] New names this season are: Ana, Batsirai, Cliff, Dumako, Emnati, Fezile, Gombe, Halima, Issa, Jasmine, Karim, and Letlama. They replaced Alcide, Bouchra, Cilida, Desmond, Eketsang, Funani, Gelena, Haleh, Idai, Joaninha, Kenneth, and Lorna after the 2018\u201319 season. If a tropical cyclone enters the South-West Indian basin from the Australian region basin (west of 90\u00b0E), it will retain the name assigned to it by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). The following storms were named in this manner: After the season, the eleven names used were automatically retired and replaced with Ancha, Bheki, Chido, Dikeledi, Elvis, Faida, Garance, Honde, Ivone, Jude and Kanto, respectively for the 2024\u201325 season.[147]"

        "content": " Hurricane Isaac was a large and powerful Cape Verde hurricane that lasted through late September and early October\u00a02000. The thirteenth tropical cyclone, ninth named storm, and the fifth hurricane of 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, Isaac developed from a tropical wave south of Cape Verde on September\u00a021. The depression intensified, and on the following day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Isaac. Due to conductive atmospheric conditions, Isaac continued to strengthen, and attained hurricane intensity on September\u00a023. Isaac managed to become a Category\u00a03 hurricane on September\u00a024, before steadily weakening shortly thereafter. By September\u00a026, the storm had deteriorated to a Category\u00a01 hurricane. However, it again encountered favorable conditions, which caused Isaac to re-intensify. As Isaac tracked northwestward, it re-strengthened into a major hurricane[nb 1] on September\u00a028. Later that day, Isaac peaked as a moderate-Category\u00a04 hurricane. However, Isaac began to track northward over an area of colder sea surface temperatures (SSTs), which gradually weakened the storm over the next three days. Eventually, the storm curved northeastward, and weakened to a tropical storm early on October\u00a01. Later that day, Isaac transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. While extratropical, Isaac brushed the British Isles, producing below gale-force winds. Isaac's extratropical remnants were eventually absorbed into another extratropical storm to the north of Scotland, on October 4. The storm had no interaction with land while tropical; however, one fatality occurred on Long Island when large swells generated by Isaac overturned a boat. In addition, rough seas also affected the coastlines of Bermuda and The Carolinas."

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September\u00a020. The wave was associated with some curvature of deep convection. Later on September\u00a020, the initial Dvorak classification was issued, whilst convection associated with the system began to consolidate. It is estimated that the wave became Tropical Depression Thirteen at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a021, while located south of Cape Verde.[2] Although the QuikScat satellite recorded winds of up to 60\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h), the National Hurricane Center set the initial intensity 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h), mostly due to a lack of deep convection and an elongated and poorly defined center. Because upper-level winds were conductive,[3] the depression strengthened and banding features significantly improved. As a result, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Isaac early on September\u00a022.[4] A ridge was present over parts of the eastern Atlantic Ocean which provided strong steering currents.[2] Later on September\u00a022, the National Hurricane Center began noting the possibility of increasing wind shear, due to a large upper trough. Despite this, the intensity predictions did not forecast weakening within the next three days.[5] Isaac continued to strengthen and reached hurricane status at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023.[2] However, the National Hurricane Center did not operationally upgrade Isaac until 2100\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, at which time the storm was a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[6] Thereafter, Isaac significantly intensified, and on the following day, it reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 120\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h).[2] The National Hurricane Center then predicted Isaac would become a Category\u00a04 hurricane on September\u00a025, though this did not materialize.[7] After reaching winds of 120\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h), Isaac slowly began weakening, due to both increasing vertical wind shear and internal fluctuations.[2] By September\u00a026, Isaac weakened to a moderate Category\u00a01 hurricane, though the National Hurricane Center noted that re-strengthening was likely, citing the possibility of warming SST's.[8] Wind shear began to decrease, which caused deep convection to re-organize into a more symmetrical pattern around the center of the storm. As a result, Isaac began re-intensifying, starting on September\u00a027.[9] Although Isaac re-developed a well-defined eye and a cold convective eyewall, only a portion of the storm had decent outflow.[10] By 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a028, Isaac attained its peak intensity with winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 943\u00a0mbar (27.8\u00a0inHg).[2] Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center noted that the storm had likely reached peak intensity, though further strengthening could not be ruled out.[11] After tracking steadily west-northwestward or northwestward since it developed on September\u00a021, the storm briefly curved northward western periphery of a mid-tropospheric anticyclone later on September\u00a028. While a Category\u00a03 hurricane on September\u00a029, Isaac passed about 500 miles (800\u00a0km) east of Bermuda.[2] Further weakening occurred as Isaac tracked into decreasing SST's, while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle.[12] Late on September\u00a029, the storm began curving east-northeastward and weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[13] After weakening to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on September\u00a030, the National Hurricane Center noted that very cold cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery indicated that the convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical.[14] Isaac remained a Category\u00a01 hurricane for almost 24\u00a0hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward.[2] Early on October\u00a01, the National Hurricane Center noted that minimal deep convection persisted near the center and much of it was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition.[15] By 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm.[2] The National Hurricane Center noted that further weakening would be slow, due to the large wind field associated with the storm.[16] At 1500\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about three hours later, while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores.[17] The extratropical remnants rapidly tracked east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October\u00a03 and October\u00a04, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October\u00a04.[2]"

Along the Grand Strand in South Carolina, rough surf and minor coastal flooding was reported.[21] In New York, swells from the storm caused a boat with four passengers to overturn in Moriches Inlet on September\u00a030. One of the passengers died from drowning. As an extratropical system, Isaac produced winds near gale-force on the British Isles during the day of October\u00a03.[2] After Isaac passed the British Isles, a bird called the blue-winged warbler was seen in Europe for the first time.[22]"

Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August\u00a023. Over the next several days, the storm treked north of the Lesser Antilles, weakening into a tropical storm on August\u00a026. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale-force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago. On August\u00a027, the storm reached hurricane status again, and the next day, the storm further intensified into a major hurricane after curving north-northwestward near The Bahamas. The next day, the storm weakened back to a Category\u00a02 hurricane and began re-curving to the northeast. One person drowned in the western Atlantic after his ship sank. Heavy rainfall and strong winds pelted Bermuda, though no damage occurred. The storm maintained hurricane intensity for several days, while tracking east of the United States. On September\u00a03, Faith reattained major hurricane status as it underwent extratropical transition, reaching peak winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). Faith weakened as it completed extratropical transition, finally losing tropical characteristics while east of Atlantic Canada. The system continued traversing the Atlantic Ocean for several days, finally dissipating on September\u00a015, while located just north of Franz Josef Land.

The system moved slowly westward and eventually reached the Atlantic Ocean.[1] It is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021, while located about 240 miles (390\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Verde.[2] Continuing westward, the depression intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Gradual intensification persisted as Tropical Storm Faith headed nearly due westward at 17 to 23\u00a0mph (27 to 37\u00a0km/h).[1][2] By August\u00a023, Faith was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane.[1][2] Curving slightly west-northwestward, the storm reached Category\u00a02 intensity and briefly peaked at sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h). Hurricane Faith curved to the northwest and weakened back to a Category\u00a01 hurricane while approaching the northeastern Leeward Islands on August\u00a025.[2] Initially, Faith was scheduled to be seeded as part of Project Stormfury. However, the scheduled seeding was cancelled as Faith was approaching The Bahamas.[3] Bypassing the Leeward Islands, Faith remained at nearly the same intensity, until re-strengthening into Category\u00a02 hurricane on August\u00a028, near Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm quickly intensified further into a Category\u00a03 hurricane only six hours later.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, Faith attained its maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h).[2] After reaching maximum sustained winds late on August\u00a029, Faith began to gradually weaken and decreased to Category\u00a02 hurricane intensity early on August\u00a030.[2] By that time, the storm turned to the northeast around the periphery of an Atlantic subtropical anticyclone while located about midway between Bermuda and Florida.[1][4] Faith remained well offshore of the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada, after veering eastward on September\u00a01.[2] Thereafter, it began to accelerate and eventually curved northeastward.[1] While approaching Europe, Faith's forward speed increased to as much as 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). At 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03, a minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg) was recorded \u2013 the lowest in relation to the storm. After remaining a Category\u00a02 hurricane since August\u00a029, Faith weakened slightly to a Category\u00a01 hurricane early on September\u00a06, as it neared the Faroe Islands.[2] Crossing the North Sea, Faith finally transitioned into an extratropical storm at 1200\u00a0UTC later that day, while centered about 125 miles (201\u00a0km) east-northeast of T\u00f3rshavn.[2][1][5] The extratropical remnants of Faith headed eastward and affected Norway with winds as high as 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[2] Tracking over Scandinavia, the extratropical storm weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression before entering the Soviet Union (present day Russia). Eventually, the storm degenerated into an extratropical low pressure area, curved northward, and retained its identity until September\u00a015,[6] when it was over Franz Josef Land, which is roughly 600 miles (970\u00a0km) from the North Pole.[5]"

These conditions inflicted minor damage to small boats and jetties.[8] In the Turks and Caicos Islands, sea defenses suffered some damage as Faith passed about 65 miles (105\u00a0km) to the east-northeast.[9] Along the East Coast of the United States, the storm produced rough seas and high tides from Cape Canaveral (then Cape Kennedy), Florida, to the Virginia Capes. Additionally, the Weather Bureau warned of possible gale-force winds in The Carolinas and Virginia, but also noted that the area would only experience fringe effects from the storm.[10] In Bermuda, the outer rainbands of Hurricane Faith produced heavy rainfall and wind gusts up to 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[11] Five people died as a result of the storm, though only one of them on land.[12][13] Rough seas in the western Atlantic battered the Alberto Benati, pitching one man overboard. Two others drowned near Denmark while attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. Another man was missing and presumed dead after heavy seas forced him and his shipmates to abandon their boat off the northern coast of Denmark. Property damage was minimal, mainly because the areas impacted by Faith were sparsely populated.[13] A 2,726\u00a0ton Norwegian car ferry known as Skagerak began to sink as it headed for Hirtshals in Region Nordjylland of Denmark. Waves pounded the side hatches, which flooded in the engine room, causing the ship to become disabled. A large-scale search operation was conducted to rescue the 144\u00a0passengers aboard. All passengers were rescued and treated for their injuries in Hj\u00f8rring, Denmark, however one person later died in the hospital.[12] In Norway, the remnants of Faith impacted areas between Ryfylke and Sunnfjord. The storm brought heavy rainfall and resulted in glacier melting, which in turn caused rampant flooding in some locations. Discharge from the Folgefonna, Fj\u00e6rland, and Sunnfjord glaciers reached a record high melt due to the remnants of Faith.[14]"

The violent tornado killed 29 people and injured 353.[1] It is the only F5/EF5 rated tornado ever officially recorded in August in the United States (unofficially the 1883 Rochester, Minnesota cyclone is considered an F5), and the only F5 tornado to strike the Chicago area.[1][2] There are no known videos or photographs of the tornado itself; however, in 2011, a video surfaced online showing the supercell that spawned the tornado.[3] The Plainfield tornado was part of a small outbreak that produced several tornadoes in the Northern United States, specifically Kansas, and the Canadian province of Ontario. The tornado was relatively abnormal, moving southeast instead of the conventional northeast motion of violent tornadoes. The event, as well as its poor warning time, drove advancements in radar technology and forecasting systems to adequately warn residents."

        "content": "For late August standards, August 28 was a particularly warm and humid day.  Temperatures reached into the low 90s\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u201334\u00a0\u00b0C; about 11\u00a0\u00b0F or 6\u00a0\u00b0C warmer than the normal of 79\u00a0\u00b0F\u00a0\u2013 26\u00a0\u00b0C), but dew points soared into the upper 70s\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C).  The presence of such a high dew point did not necessarily predict a severe thunderstorm outbreak; the prior day, similar conditions existed in northern Illinois with the exception of a warmer mid level troposphere.  A warmer atmosphere inhibits the rising of surface air through the atmosphere; a requirement for convective precipitation (precipitation resulting from humid surface air ascending to condense in a cooler atmosphere above) to occur.  This warmer air aloft can describe either (or both) weak lapse rates, thus weak instability or a capping inversion. The atmosphere on August 28 was significantly more unstable as the approach of a low-pressure system from the northwest cooled the mid levels (and also caused dynamic lifting) as instability continued to build in the capped, muggy environment, although the wind fields (strong, but out of the west-northwest and unidirectional) were not suitable for significant tornadic development.  As a result of the very high low-level temperature and dew point, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values were in excess of 8,000\u00a0J/kg; generally, values of 1,500\u00a0J/kg are considered to be moderately unstable, whereas values of more than 4,000\u00a0J/kg are considered \"extreme\".  The lifted index (LI), the dominant estimate of instability used at the time, was also extreme.  Generally, an LI value of \u22126\u00a0\u00b0C or below readily supports severe thunderstorm development, but during the day the LI value ranged from \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C to \u221214\u00a0\u00b0C.  Such extreme instability can lead to explosive thunderstorm development, very strong updrafts, and modulates the updraft to better enable tornadogenesis. Conditions were ripe for severe thunderstorm development, and with both low level and high level steering winds from the west-northwest, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center issued a Severe Thunderstorm Watch for northern Illinois valid 1:30\u00a0p.m. through 8:00\u00a0p.m. CDT that night.  The NSSFC predicted a derecho-type event for later that night as rapidly developing thunderstorms along a cold front in Wisconsin would be carried by the steering flow into the Chicago area.  One of these storms developed supercellular characteristics south of Rockford, steering 30 to 40 degrees to the right of prevailing steering winds.  By now, mid-level steering winds had begun to veer, causing a wind profile slightly more favorable for tornadic development.  This helped develop a high precipitation supercell. The \"HP\" supercell produced multiple funnel sightings, hail damage, and damaging winds south of Rockford before heading southeast toward Will County and dropped a rain wrapped tornado.  This is why many in the path did not see the actual tornado but more of a wall of water and dark clouds coming toward them. As the storm continued south it produced a 16-mile (26\u00a0km) swath of damage ranging from F1 to F5 intensity.  The National Weather Service in Rosemont, Illinois, serving all of Central and Northern Illinois at the time, did not issue a Tornado Warning until 10 minutes after the tornado had hit Plainfield. Despite radar technology being less developed than now, the storm had a well defined hook echo on radar imagery, a signature often correlated with tornadic supercells."

        "content": "The tornado formed from a supercell thunderstorm, which initially formed in the vicinity of Janesville in south central Wisconsin, shortly after 12\u00a0p.m. CDT. It produced a tornado near Pecatonica, Illinois in Winnebago County, about 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) west of Rockford, that touched down at about 1:42\u00a0p.m. CDT. That tornado did not last long; however, the storm continued to move southeast towards the Aurora area, and spawned four short-lived, predecessor tornadoes in southwestern Kane County, between 2:45\u00a0p.m. and 3:15\u00a0p.m. Within that time period, the storm also struck the Aurora Municipal Airport in Sugar Grove at about 3:05\u00a0p.m., lasting until 3:10\u00a0p.m., where propeller planes were flipped, and the control tower was evacuated, but no injuries were reported.[4][5] Continuing to move to the southeast, starting at about 3:15\u00a0p.m., the supercell spawned the principal tornado, touching down near Oswego in Kendall County, and rapidly strengthening into a F2 and F3 tornado as it approached Will County.  The tornado traveled southeast into Wheatland Township, Will County, near the Wheatland Plains subdivision, northwest of Plainfield.  At 3:25\u00a0p.m. CDT in Wheatland Township,[5] the tornado damaged nearly all of the homes in the Wheatland Plains subdivision where there were several injuries, including one child who had to be airlifted to Loyola University Hospital in Maywood and later died of injuries. Twelve homes were destroyed in Wheatland Plains. Past Wheatland Plains, the tornado continued to strengthen as it tore across open farmland, and reached F5 intensity in this area. A narrow swath of very intense ground scouring was observed, as mature corn crop was completely stripped from the ground, leaving nothing but bare soil behind. Several inches of topsoil were removed as well. As the tornado crossed US-30, a 20-ton tractor-trailer was thrown more than half a mile from the road, killing the driver. Three other motorists were killed in this area as their vehicles were thrown from the road. Some cars were picked up and carried considerable distances through the air. It was determined that the tornado reached its peak strength in this area, and the F5 rating was based on the extreme ground scouring that occurred. Beyond this point, the ground scouring became less pronounced as the tornado weakened slightly as it approached Plainfield at high-end F4 intensity.[6][7] The tornado struck Plainfield, Illinois, around 3:28\u00a0p.m. Around 3:30\u00a0p.m. the tornado directly struck the Plainfield High School, killing a science teacher and two maintenance workers.[4] Students who had been out practicing for the fall football programs ran into the high school to take shelter a few minutes before the storm hit. After an alarm was pulled by a dean in the main office, the volleyball players preparing for a game in the gymnasium rushed to the nearest door and took shelter in the hallway. It has been reported that as soon as the last player was through the door, a coach quickly closed it, only for it to be immediately ripped back off by the storm. The gymnasium proceeded to fall apart and crash down, which filled the gap in the doorway. They took shelter in the same hallway as the football team, and once the tornado had passed, that was the only hallway left standing in the building. The tornado then demolished the Plainfield School District Administration building, where the wife of a custodian was killed. The tornado crossed Route 59 (Division Street) and ripped into St. Mary Immaculate Church and school, claiming an additional 3 lives; the principal of the school, a music teacher, and the son of the cook at the rectory.  Fifty-five homes were destroyed in Plainfield itself, a few of which were swept away. A grocery store east of the high school was badly damaged. Gravestones in the nearby cemetery were toppled, and a metal dumpster was found wrapped around the top of a partially debarked tree. Damage in Plainfield was rated as high-end F4.[6] The storm then worked its way southeast towards the large city of Joliet, damaging homes in the Crystal Lawns, Lily Cache and Warwick subdivisions and killing five more people: one in the Lily Cache subdivision of Plainfield, and two each in the Crystal Lawns and Warwick subdivisions; an additional three people would later succumb from injuries sustained during the storm. The tornado ripped through the Grand Prairie Elementary School (Plainfield School District), causing significant damage. Observers watched from the doors at the Louis Joliet Mall, as the tornado passed just southwest of them. Sixty-nine homes were destroyed in Crystal Lawns, 75 homes were destroyed in Peerless Estates, 55 homes were destroyed in Lily Cache, and 50 homes were destroyed in Warwick. Most of the homes in Peerless Estates and Warwick were newly built. The tornado then moved towards Crest Hill.  At 3:38\u00a0p.m. the storm ripped through the Crest Hill Lakes Apartment complex, where it caused F3 damage and claimed another eight lives, destroying one apartment building and half of another apartment building.[4] Neither have been rebuilt. The tornado also ripped through the Colony West subdivision, destroying 12 townhomes, none of which have been rebuilt either. A married couple died while in their car on Cedarwood Drive outside the apartment complex. The tornado then destroyed three apartment buildings on Elizabeth Court. Three more homes were destroyed in Bridalwreath, southeast of Elizabeth Court. Homes were damaged on Arden Place, and two high tension wire structures were destroyed at Douglas Street and Palladium Drive West. Further southeast, the tornado continued to lose strength and lifted near Woodlawn Avenue and Campbell Street in Joliet. The parent thunderstorm continued until it crossed over the Indiana border, where it dissipated around 4:30\u00a0p.m. The Plainfield Tornado caused over $165 million worth of damage. As the storm tore through Plainfield, nine people were killed (one additional victim would die afterward, from carbon monoxide poisoning, while guarding his home after the storm). The remaining victims were from Joliet and Crest Hill. In all, a total of 29 people would die because of the tornado. A total of 353 people were also injured in storm. This was the deadliest tornado event in the region since the 1967 Oak Lawn tornado."

As the Chicago office was overwhelmed with its workload, no warnings were issued by the office until 2:32\u00a0p.m. \u2013 nearly an hour after the first tornado was sighted southeast of Rockford. A second severe thunderstorm warning was issued almost an hour later at 3:23\u00a0p.m., but this provided no indication that a tornado was on the ground and did not mention the area where the tornado had tracked. No tornado warning was issued until after the tornado lifted. Even though the Chicago office had an \"add-on\" Doppler improvement that was developed in 1974, that device had been disabled by a lightning strike before the August 28 storm.[10] As a result of the lack of a warning, many meteorologists today refer to the \"Plainfield Syndrome\" as the idea that it's better to issue too many warnings and be wrong, than to miss one critical warning, as was the case for the Plainfield Tornado.[11] After the 1990 tornado, the National Weather Service reduced the Chicago office's workload by creating an office in Romeoville, Illinois in 1993,[12] as well as in Lincoln, Illinois in 1995,[13] and allowing offices in the Quad Cities, St. Louis, Missouri, Indianapolis, Indiana and Paducah, Kentucky to issue forecasts for their respective areas."

Already it has the banked appearance of a cumulus cloud, but it is black instead of white and it hangs low, seeming to hug the earth. Instead of being slow to change its form, it appears to be rolling on itself from the crest downward. As it sweeps onward, the landscape is progressively blotted out. Birds fly in terror before the storm, and only those that are strong of wing may escape.

The city is surrounded by the Mississippi River, Lake Pontchartrain to the north, and Lake Borgne on the east. The earliest-settled parts of New Orleans and surrounding communities are above sea level. However, flooding was long a threat, from the periodic high waters of the Mississippi and from more occasional severe tropical storms which pushed the waters of Lake Pontchartrain into settled areas. Construction of the levees along the River began soon after the city was founded, and more extensive river levees were built as the city grew. These earthen barriers were erected to prevent damage caused by seasonal Mississippi River flooding. The Lake Pontchartrain shore was mostly undeveloped swamp, and only small levees were built there in the 19th century."

The 1915 New Orleans hurricane, or as it was called locally, \"the Great Storm of 1915\" struck with more wind damage than the 1909 storm. Flooding was more limited in scope and duration due to improved drainage pumping. However, Lake Pontchartrain rose to a higher level than previously recorded, overtopping some of the back levees. The Sewage and Water Board recommended taller levees to protect the city from flooding on the lake side. A much larger project to build up levees along the lake and extend the shoreline out by dredging began in 1927. As the city grew, there was increased pressure to develop lower-lying areas. A large system of canals and pumps was constructed to drain the land. Flooding containment efforts until the mid-20th century primarily focused on floods from the Mississippi River. In 1947, the Fort Lauderdale hurricane struck the New Orleans area. There was moderate wind damage. Flood prevention was largely successful in Orleans Parish, but there was severe flooding in the new East Jefferson suburbs near the Lake."

As radar showed the storm heading for the city, a mandatory evacuation of Eastern New Orleans was declared. The Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal channeled storm surge into the metro area.[citation needed] A levee failure was responsible for major flooding in the Lower 9th Ward. The heavy flood damage caused by Hurricane Betsy brought concerns about hurricane flooding to the forefront. Betsy resulted in a major redesign of the levee system. By authorizing the United States Army Corps of Engineers to design and construct the flood protection, Congress essentially overrode responsibility for flood protection by the local levee boards.  The Flood Control Act of 1965 directed the Corps of Engineers to plan for the maximum anticipated hurricane for the area. (This project was still under construction when the city was struck by Katrina 40 years later.) The Corps of Engineers also designed a Lake Pontchartrain Hurricane Barrier to shield the city with flood gates like those which protect the Netherlands from the North Sea. Congress provided funding, and construction began in 1971. But the work stopped in 1977 when a federal judge ruled, in a lawsuit brought by the environmental group Save Our Wetlands, that the Corps' environmental impact statement was deficient. In 1985, after nearly a decade of court battles, the Corps scrapped the plan, and decided to reinforce the existing levee system instead.[5] The threat of 1969's Hurricane Camille was known in advance through improved radar technology and much of New Orleans braced for a repeat of Betsy. But Camille turned east and wreaked havoc on the Gulf coast of Mississippi and Alabama. Hurricane Juan (1985) prompted a large evacuation from the city but did little damage. Hurricane Andrew threatened the city in 1992.  Clearly a major killer storm which had already devastated parts of south Florida, it prompted the largest evacuation of the city to date. Andrew turned west of the city but prompted re-evaluation of emergency evacuation procedures. Hurricane Georges in 1998 precipitated an even larger evacuation. The Louisiana Superdome was opened as a shelter of last resort for those unable to evacuate, with unfortunate consequences as much of the venue was looted. Highways out of the city were tied up bumper to bumper, prompting development of the Contraflow lane reversal plan. The evacuation from Greater New Orleans and the Mississippi coast was the largest in U.S. history up to that point. [2] Georges missed the city, but it caused significant storm surge, raising the level of Lake Pontchartrain to the point that the city was spared major flooding only by the lake levees and flood walls. There was significant destruction to the areas just outside the flood walls, including at Little Woods [?] and at West End near the mouth of the 17th Street Canal."

Thousands of refugees could end up in Houston.\"[6] In 2002, The Times Picayune published a feature covering various scenarios, including a Category\u00a05 hurricane hitting the city from the south. The series also explored the various environmental changes that have increased the area's vulnerability. One article in the series concluded that hundreds of thousands would be left homeless, and it would take months to dry out the area and begin to make it liveable. But there would not be much for residents to come home to.  The local economy would be in ruins.[8] Many concerns focus around the fact that the city lies below sea level with a levee system that was designed for hurricanes of no greater intensity than Category 3.[9]  Furthermore, its natural defenses, the surrounding marshland and the barrier islands, have been dwindling in recent years.[10]  Just a few months before Katrina, the FX docudrama Oil Storm depicted a Category\u00a04 hurricane hitting New Orleans, killing thousands of people and forcing residents to evacuate and hide out in the Superdome, and speculated about a national economic meltdown caused by the decreased oil supply."

The study identified the problem: the New Orleans area is like a bowl, surrounded by levees which are strongest along the outer Mississippi and primarily intended to contain river flooding. When a hurricane drives water into Lake Pontchartrain, the weaker levees bordering Pontchartrain and canals leading to it are overwhelmed. Water then flows into the below-sea-level city, accompanied by water overflowing the levees along the Mississippi on the south side of the city center.[13]"

Hurricane Pam was imagined as a slow-moving Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph. It would bring up to 20 inches (510\u00a0mm) of rain to some parts of southeastern Louisiana and produce a levee-topping storm surge.[16] The consequence assessment for Hurricane Pam indicated that more than one million people would be displaced and that 600,000 buildings would be damaged, with some completely destroyed. 60,000 people would be killed. The report on the simulation, TIME reported, warned that transportation would be a major problem in any storm situation paralleling the fictional \"Hurricane Pam.\"[17] Follow-on Hurricane Pam workshops were conducted in November/December 2004, July 2005, and August 2005. The Hurricane Pam scenario and the level of attention that the federal government paid to it were discussed following the catastrophic effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans in November and December 2005.[18][19] On January 25, 2005, the Louisiana Sea Grant forum discussed additional results of several simulations of strong hurricanes hitting New Orleans.[20]"

However, due to poorly designed levees and the worst civil engineering failure in United States history, most of the city experienced flooding similar to a direct hit; see: Levee failures in Greater New Orleans, 2005. There were many predictions of hurricane risk in New Orleans before Katrina.[25][26][27] On August 26 the storm, at one point up to a Category\u00a05, was in the Gulf with a projection to possibly hit New Orleans a few days later. (The previous day the projected path was towards the Florida Panhandle.) On August 27 Mayor Nagin declared a state of emergency and called for a voluntary evacuation. The following day he issued the city's first ever whole-city mandatory evacuation order.[28]  A mandatory evacuation order is an extreme measure: the most recent such order in Louisiana occurred when east New Orleans was ordered evacuated in 1965. There have been various plans to mitigate or prevent catastrophes. The evacuation plans were the most successful. The contraflow worked relatively smoothly, and over 80% of the population succeeded in fleeing the area in advance of the storm. The evacuation no doubt saved thousands of lives. However, beyond the evacuation of those willing and able to leave town through their own resources, almost every other aspect of preparedness was found wanting. Like many other cities, New Orleans heavily relied on evacuation in case of a Category\u00a05 storm. The inadequacy of evacuation plans was shown when no provision was made in time to evacuate the large number of people\u2013 elderly, disabled, those without cars\u2013 who could not leave by their own means. Blame for lack of preparedness has been leveled at all levels of government. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin had been criticized for not following the city's evacuation plan which called for the use of school buses to transport disadvantaged and elderly citizens out of the city. Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco was also criticized for not deploying the Louisiana National Guard sooner, although she did in fact deploy them before the hurricane hit and requested reinforcements from other states. Blanco asked for additional resources from the federal government, but refused to declare martial law or a state of emergency.[29]  Disorganization began when the Louisiana Governor declined a proposal from the White House to put National Guard troops under the control of the federal government.[29]  President George W. Bush and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff were also criticized for failures on the federal level as well as with his leadership role.[30] FEMA chief Michael D. Brown admitted on the 1 year anniversary of landfall that there was no plan,[31] and claimed that in the immediate aftermath of the disaster White House officials told him to lie to put a more positive spin on the Federal response.[32]"

After a typical hurricane hit the region, the plan would be for disaster relief forces to reach the city by overland routes. Since there was no New Orleans mass flooding and isolation by flooding plan, the plan that was pulled off the books was the hurricane relief plan. This plan failed because the relief personnel, most of whom were in trucks, could not get past nor through the areas that were under water. That there was no mass flooding relief plan to be executed was obvious by the lack of any heavy-lift helicopters such as Chinooks in relief forces that would have replaced the usual truck-born hurricane relief forces. A mass flooding with regional isolation plan would not have used land-based relief forces at all overland relief was impossible because of the barrier in place with the flooding."

Provisions for supplies were just barely adequate; sanitation, medical, and crowd control were worse. Since there was no flood-based federal nor state plan, heavy lift capacity helicopters that could have brought 16 tons of water, medical and food per flight were nowhere to be found. The much less effective hurricane-only response utilized much smaller UH and Black Hawk helicopters. Under the National Response Plan, disaster planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility.  On the day after the Hurricane, Michael Chertoff invoked the National Response Plan, transferring emergency authority to the Department of Homeland Security. Civil order broke down, infrastructure failed, and some 80% of the city flooded. A few government responders, including Coast Guard helicopters and Louisiana Fisheries & Wildlife Boats, responded early and worked hard to save people stranded in the flooding, but their numbers were inadequate for the scope of the disaster. Private volunteers with boats assisted with rescue in great numbers, but significant Federal response was largely absent until 5\u00a0days after the disaster."

The levee system again failed, re-flooding low-lying portions of the city such as the Lower Ninth Ward.[36] Hurricane Ernesto in 2006 originally threatened Louisiana before hitting Florida, causing early preparations and rising oil prices.[37][38][39] Making landfall in Louisiana on September 1, 2008 as a category two hurricane, Hurricane Gustav was the first to put large scale preparations in motion, although the storm was still in Caribbean on the third anniversary of Katrina. Locals were warned to prepare for a possible evacuation of the city. Additional National Guard units were called out, and a state of emergency was declared.[40][41][42] No \"shelters of last resort\" were to be used.

Congress tabled the proposal, never addressing it on the floor, citing budgetary concerns resulting from the Iraq War. A senior Corps official made an off-hand estimate that this project would require approximately $1\u00a0Billion dollars and would take 20 years, stating \"It's possible to protect New Orleans from a Category\u00a05 hurricane... we've got to start. To do nothing is tantamount to negligence.\"[47] Whether or not such additional funding might have been capable of preventing the extensive flooding in New Orleans caused by Katrina, is a matter that has yet to be determined. Starting in 2003, federal spending on the Southeast Louisiana Project was substantially reduced. Lt. General Carl Strock, Chief of Engineers at the Corps of Engineers, said that, \"at the time that these levees were designed and constructed, it was felt that that was an adequate level given the probability of an event like this occurring.\" Strock also said that he did not believed that funding levels contributed to the disaster, commenting that, \"the intensity of this storm simply exceeded the design capacity of this levee.\" Strock also told reporters that the Corps of Engineers \"had a 200- or 300-year level of protection. That means that an event that we were protecting from might be exceeded every 200 or 300 years.\"[48] From 2001 through 2005, the Bush administration battled with Congress to cut a total of approximately 67% from the budgetary requests from the Corps of Engineers for levee augmentation projects in the New Orleans area, but ultimately settled with Congress on a 50% cut in these budgetary requests. In February 2004, Al Naomi, a project manager for the Corps of Engineers, stated that, \"I've got at least six levee construction contracts (in the New Orleans area where funding has been cut) that need to be done to raise the levee protection back to where it should be (because of settling). Right now I owe my contractors about US$5\u00a0Million. And we're going to have to pay them interest.\"[49] Even as the Bush administration was cutting the Corps of Engineers' budget, many were criticizing the administration for not cutting the budget more. The New York Times, in particular, published several editorials criticizing the large size of the $17\u00a0Billion Corps budget, and called for the Senate to cut, \"pork,\" in S. 728, which would have provided $512\u00a0Million in funding for hurricane protection projects in southern Louisiana.[citation needed] Just after Hurricane Katrina hit, there was some concern expressed that government officials had placed an overemphasis on disaster recovery, while neglecting the process of pre-planning and preparation.[50] In the 17 months following Katrina, five investigations were carried out.  The only federally ordered study was conducted by the American Society of Civil Engineers and paid for by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.[51]  Two major independent studies were done by the University of California at Berkeley[52] and Louisiana State University.[53]  Two minor studies were done by FEMA and the insurance industry.  All five studies basically agree on the engineering mechanisms of failure. The failure mechanisms included overtopping of levees and floodwalls by the storm surge, consequential undermining of flood wall foundations or other weakening by water of the wall foundations, and the storm surge pressures exceeding the strength of the floodwalls.  In June 2006, a contrite Lt. Gen Carl Strock took responsibility for the failure of metro New Orleans flood protection, calling the system \"a system in name only.\"[54] As of August 2006, the Corps of Engineers planned to spend $6\u00a0billion to make sure that by 2010, the city would probably be flooded only once every 100 years.  But this would not equal the best levee system in the world, which is in The Netherlands.  That system is designed to protect populated areas against anything but a 1-in-10,000-years flood.  If the Corps built a 1-in-500-year levee system in New Orleans, Ivan van Heerden, deputy director of Louisiana State University's Hurricane Center, says, it would cost $30\u00a0billion.[55] According to a study by the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council, levees and floodwalls surrounding New Orleans\u2014no matter how large or sturdy\u2014cannot provide absolute protection against overtopping or failure in extreme events.  Levees and floodwalls should be viewed as a way to reduce risks from hurricanes and storm surges, not as measures that eliminate risk.  For structures in hazardous areas and residents who do not relocate, the committee recommended major floodproofing measures such as elevating the first floor of buildings to at least the 100-year flood level.[56]"

        "header": "The impact of Louisiana's sinking coast",
        "content": "When the Corps of Engineers started systematically leveeing the river in the 19th century, it cut off the region's main source of silt, the raw material of delta-building in the Mississippi River Delta and the Wetlands of Louisiana.[57] The weight of large buildings and infrastructure and the leaching of water, oil and gas from beneath the surface across the region have also contributed to the problem. Following the great floods of 1927, the Mississippi River was surrounded by a series of levees meant to protect the city from such floods. In 1965, New Orleans was hit by Hurricane Betsy, which caused tremendous flooding in the New Orleans area. The federal government began a levee-building program to protect New Orleans from a Category 3 hurricane (the same strength as Betsy). These series of levees were completed in recent years before Hurricane Katrina. However, an unintended consequence of the levees was that natural silt deposits from the Mississippi River were unable to replenish the delta, causing the coastal wetlands of Louisiana to wash away and the city of New Orleans to sink even deeper.[10][57] The Mississippi River delta is subsiding faster than any other place in the nation.[citation needed] While the land is sinking, sea level has been rising. In the past 100 years, land subsidence and sea-level rise have recently added three feet[57] to all storm surges. That extra height puts affected areas under deeper water; it also means flooding from weaker storms and from the outer edges of powerful storms spreads over wider areas. The marshes that ring New Orleans, as well as the land depression of the city itself, originally above sea level,[57] have sunk the quickest. The problem with the wetlands was further worsened by salt water intrusion caused by the canals dug by the oil companies and private individuals in this marshland. This erosion of the wetlands not only caused Louisiana to lose 24 square miles (62\u00a0km2) per year of land annually and 1,900 square miles (4,900\u00a0km2) of land since the 1930s, but it also destroyed Louisiana's first line of defense against hurricanes.[57] Hurricanes draw their strength from the sea, so they quickly weaken and begin to dissipate when they make landfall. Hurricanes moving over fragmenting marshes toward the New Orleans area can retain more strength, and their winds and large waves pack more speed and destructive power. Scientists working for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources measured some of these effects during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Andrew's surge height dropped from 9.3 feet (2.8\u00a0m) at Cocodrie to 3.3 feet (1.0\u00a0m) at the Houma Navigation Canal 23 miles (37\u00a0km) to the north. For every mile of the marsh-and-water landscape it traversed, it lost 3.1\u00a0inches of height, sparing some homes farther north from more flooding. Currently Louisiana has 30% of the total coastal marsh and accounts for 90% of the coastal marsh loss in the lower 48 states. The engineering of the river has basically brought the Gulf of Mexico much closer to New Orleans, making it more vulnerable to hurricanes. The combination of sinking land and rising seas has placed the Mississippi River delta as much as 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) lower relative to sea level than it was a century ago,[57] and the process continues. That means hurricane floods driven inland from the Gulf have risen by corresponding amounts. Storms that once would not have had much impact can now be devastating events, and flooding now penetrates into places where it has rarely occurred before. The problem also is slowly eroding levee protection, cutting off evacuation routes sooner and putting dozens of communities and valuable infrastructure at risk of being wiped out by the flooding. State and federal officials have recently pushed a $14\u00a0billion plan to rebuild wetlands over the next 30 years, to be funded by oil and gas royalties, called Coast 2050.\n[57][58] Louisiana will receive US$540\u00a0million under the energy bill enacted in August 2005. More money for this program is likely to come with aid from Hurricane Katrina. The original actual cost needed for the project, however, was $14\u00a0billion.[57] Wetlands have the capacity to absorb storm surges at the rate of 1-foot (0.30\u00a0m) per 2.7 miles (4.3\u00a0km). However, due to the systematic, long-term nature of wetland loss,[26] and because wetland remediation can take decades,[59] it is not possible to pinpoint blame for wetland loss on any specific Congress, legislature, President, or governor."

Forming from the monsoon trough in the Philippine Sea, Thelma was first designated as a tropical cyclone on July\u00a07. After moving north, Thelma turned west, while remaining poorly organized. It finally attained typhoon status on July\u00a09, soon after developing an eye, and began to intensify at a brisker clip. During the evening of July\u00a010, Thelma attained maximum intensity while well to the east of the northern Philippines. It also turned sharply northward in response to a trough, slowly weakening. On July\u00a015, Typhoon Thelma, now greatly reduced in intensity, struck the south coast of South Korea. The next day, Thelma rapidly dissipated, shortly after emerging into the Sea of Japan. Although Thelma remained well offshore the Philippines, around 500\u00a0homes were swept away due to flooding, which left more than 3,500\u00a0people homeless. A total of 130\u00a0people were rescued after a vessel sunk. Nationwide, 12\u00a0people perished. In Japan, the typhoon brought heavy rains that was responsible for property damage in 19\u00a0prefectures. Throughout the country, three people died while around 1,000\u00a0dwellings were flooded. Considered by the media to be the worst typhoon to hit South Korea in 28\u00a0years, Thelma brought widespread damage throughout the nation. Over 50 boats sunk or were otherwise damaged in Pusan, resulting in the loss of 150\u00a0people at sea. Overall, 8,881\u00a0buildings were damaged or destroyed across South Korea. Approximately 6,500\u00a0houses were demolished, leaving about 29,000\u00a0people without shelter. In addition, about 62,000\u00a0ha (153,205 acres) of farmland were flooded. A total of 3,879\u00a0vessels were damaged, including 2,829\u00a0that were destroyed or seriously damaged. This represented around 4%\u00a0of the country's fishing fleet. Nationwide, 123\u00a0people were killed, 212\u00a0were rendered missing, and 114 were injured. In addition, damage totaled $272\u00a0million, of which property damage totaled $222\u00a0million.[nb 1] Due to the impact of the typhoon to South Korea, over 167,000\u00a0government workers, including thousands of military reserves, were mobilized to search for survivors and repair damage. In response of 100\u00a0farmers protesting over the slow timing of aid, the South Korean government agreed to provide $237\u00a0million in aid."

Based on this, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system. At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression, based on an increase in both convection and organization. Initially, the JTWC predicted the depression to move north near a weakness in a subtropical ridge, and then turned west as the ridge built back in.[1] Shortly after becoming a depression, the system quickly became elongated and lost organization. A Hurricane Hunter aircraft at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a08 suggested that the depression had degenerated an open wave, with no closed surface circulation. Thirteen hours later, the system passed roughly 110\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi) north of Guam. After turning west while accelerating, the system began to organize, and the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm midday on July\u00a08.[1] Meanwhile, the JMA increased to intensity estimate to 90\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph).[4][nb 3] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started to track the storm and assigned it with the local name Katring.[6] Despite being forecast by the JTWC to re-curve out to sea, Thelma veered west while[1] slowly intensifying.[2] Thus, a banding eye began to develop. Due to a combination of a Hurricane Hunter aircraft pass that estimated surface winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and satellite-based Dvorak estimates, the JTWC upgraded Thelma into a typhoon at 0000 UTC on July 9.[1] Six hours later, the JMA followed suit.[2] Over the next 36\u00a0hours, Thelma entered a period of rapid deepening,[1] and by 1800\u00a0UTC July\u00a010, the JMA increased the intensity to 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[2] During the following afternoon, the JTWC upgraded Thelma to a super typhoon, the first of the season, based on Dvorak-based satellite intensity estimates.[1] At this time, the JMA estimated that Thelma attained its peak intensity, with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph)[2] while the JTWC assessed the peak intensity of Thelma to 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph).[1] Shortly after attaining maximum intensity, cold tops surrounding the eye began to warm and poleward outflow became restricted to its north. On the evening of July\u00a011, an aircraft reconnaissance flight noted an open eyewall and an increasingly elliptical eye. After abruptly turning north-northwest in response to a break in the ridge on July\u00a012,[1] steady weakening ensured.[2] After traversing the East China Sea, Thelma passed near Okinawa on July\u00a014 and then made landfall over southern Korea about 180\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Pusan on the evening of July\u00a015.[7] At the time of landfall, the JMA estimated winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph).[2] It then weakened rapidly while moving northeastwards across the Korean Peninsula. Early on July 16, Thelma entered the Sea of Japan and according to the JTWC, dissipated near Vladivostok,[7] although its remnants were followed by the JMA for two more days.[2]"

Elsewhere, the city of Kumamoto received the highest 24\u00a0hour rainfall total in the nation, with 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in).[10] The aforementioned heavy rains resulted in property damage in 19\u00a0states.[11] Three people were killed.[12] A young woman died when her car was inundated, and a middle school student died in a landslide, while a 41-year-old man perished after his automobile drowned. Overall, three people were hurt and over 1,000\u00a0homes were flooded.[11]"

According to government officials, the lack of warning resulted in increased casualties and damage.[13] Although Thelma had weakened considerably prior to landfall, the typhoon was considered by press reports to be the worst to strike South Korea since 1959.[14] Rainfall across the nation varied, but peaked at 270\u00a0mm (11\u00a0in) in Kangnung,[14] resulting in rivers overflowing their banks.[15] Damage was widespread, with the North Kyongsang and Kangwon provinces sustaining the worst effects of the system. In Pusan, the country's second-largest city, 16\u00a0people were killed[16] and 50 boats sunk or were damaged due to storm surge by the city's port.[17] Roughly 150\u00a0seamen and fishermen were initially reported as missing,[18] including 23 from a 999\u00a0t (999,000\u00a0kg) freighter, Hanjin-ho, that capsized offshore,[19] but by July\u00a018, authorities had called off searches for the missing.[20] Moreover, another 3,000 short tons (2,722\u00a0t) freighter also sunk due to the typhoon near Pusan, where nine crewmen were feared dead.[18] Offshore Sinan, two people were confirmed to have perished, along with 23\u00a0others presumed dead after a large fishing trawler sunk.[21] Elsewhere, four members of the same family died when their home was buried by a mudslide in Milyang.[17] Seven members of one family were killed when their house was demolished by a mudslide in Kwangju,[22] where 18\u00a0others were rescued due to flooding.[21] At least 6,600\u00a0people had been displaced and 993\u00a0structures were demolished in South Kyongsang,[21] where damage was estimated at $13\u00a0million.[23] Along the southeastern portion of the nation, five casualties occurred due to a landslide.[12] Overall, 8,881\u00a0structures were damaged or destroyed across the nation.[24] Approximately 6,500\u00a0dwellings were destroyed,[7] and around 29,000\u00a0people were left homeless by the typhoon.[13] In addition, about 62,000\u00a0ha (150,000 acres) of farmland were inundated.[7] A total of 3,879\u00a0vessels were damaged by the system,[25] 2,829\u00a0of which were destroyed or seriously damaged,[26] and 100\u00a0capsized.[18] This represented around 4% of the country's fishing fleet.[24] In all, 123\u00a0people were killed, 212\u00a0were rendered missing, and 114\u00a0were injured. Nationwide, damage totaled $272\u00a0million,[27] of which property damage totaled $222 million.[25] As a result of the impact, over 167,000\u00a0government workers,[28] including thousands of military reserves, were mobilized to search for survivors, as well as repair roads, waterways, buildings,[19] and power lines.[29] Most of the homeless were housed in relief centers. Approximately 100\u00a0angry farmers blocked a road with vehicles near the southern town of Sanchong to complain that they were not getting emergency aid faster enough and also demanded full compensation for destroyed homes and crops.[18] In response, the government agreed to provide $237\u00a0million in aid, $25\u00a0million of which came from the federal government, and the rest was raised via bonds. Fishermen and farmers who suffered property losses were allowed to borrow up to a $3,720-interest free loan from banks and were also awarded a tax break. The government also paid $3,720\u00a0to the families of those who died.[30]"

It had no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1987, but most tropical cyclones formed between May and November.[1] Tropical storms that formed in the entire basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names. A total of 25 tropical cyclones formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 24 became tropical storms.

In Guangdong, about 113,000\u00a0ha (279,230 acres) of farmland were inundated and 63,000\u00a0ha (155,675 acres) of banana plantations were damaged or destroyed. Extensive irrigation works were also damaged and 17 cows were killed. There, seven people were dead and eighty-six others were injured. Over 45,000 houses collapsed while more than 210,000 dwellings were damaged. Approximately 350 bridges were destroyed. In Guangxi, three deaths and twenty-six injuries were reported. As a result of the heavy rain, 45 bridges and over 780 houses sustained damaged. In addition, over 7,000\u00a0ha (17,295 acres) of farmland were flooded. The railway service was also temporarily disrupted. In Hong Kong, damage was minimal and only one structure was demolished.[6]"

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Sperry can be traced back to a weak surface circulation that formed on June 24 as part of the monsoon trough 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) northwest of Truk. A second area of disturbed weather subsequently developed 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) east of the Marshall Islands. The two areas consolidated into one on June 25, even though further development was initially slow to occur due to strong wind shear created by a tropical upper tropospheric trough near Wake Island. On June 25, the storm began to show signs of organization while tracking northwest;[4] however, the JMA did not upgrade the system into a tropical depression until 00:00 UTC on June 26.[5] On the next day, both the JTWC and JMA classified the system as Tropical Storm Sperry after the low-level center became better defined and the storm developed a central dense overcast \u2013 a large mass of deep convection.[4][5] Later on June 28, Sperry was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JMA.[5] On the next day, both agencies upgraded Sperry into a typhoon, the second of the season, based on reports from hurricane hunters.[4] At noon on June 28, the JTWC and JMA reported that Sperry peaked in strength; the agencies estimated winds of 135 and 120\u00a0km/h (85 and 75\u00a0mph) respectively at this time.[4][5] By June 29, Sperry began to approach a break in the ridge as well as a cold front, causing the storm to recurve to the northeast, becoming the first storm of the season to interact with mid-latitude westerlies. Thunderstorm activity quickly became displaced from the center due to increased wind shear,[4] and the JMA downgraded Sperry into a severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on June 30.[5] On the next day, both the JTWC and JMA declared Sperry an extratropical cyclone,[4][5] although its remains later merged with a frontal zone.[4]"

On the next day, after the storm developed an eye,[4] the JMA followed suit and classified Wynne as a typhoon.[5] A smaller than average typhoon, Wynne turned west-northwest. By July 26, Wynne reached its maximum intensity,[4] with the JTWC reporting winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) and the JMA reporting winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[4][5] of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h). As it rounded the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, the cyclone became sheared from the north, which caused the storm to weaken and its center to become exposed from the deep convection. Even so, it maintained typhoon intensity until July 30,[4] according to both agencies.[4][5] Recurving east of Honsh\u016b, Wynne continued to weaken.[4] Both the JTWC and JMA determined that Wynne transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by the afternoon of July 31,[4][5] although the JMA continued to track Wynne for five additional days.[5] Prior to the arrival of the typhoon on Alamagan, a handful of people sought shelter.[7] All coconut trees and 90\u2013100% of crops on islands of Alamagan and Agrihan were destroyed by the typhoon.[4] All structures on Alamgan were destroyed, including the radio tower, which was the island's communication to the rest of Saipan.

A low-level center first began evident two days later,[4] and on September 4, the JMA classified the disturbance as a tropical depression,[5] with the JTWC following suit at 18:00 UTc that day. After passing Guam, Freda began to intensify at a faster clip;[4] both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Freda on the morning of September 5.[4][5] Quasi-stationary, Freda steadily intensified, and following the appearance of a small eye on satellite imagery,[4] Freda was upgraded into a typhoon by both the JTWC and JMA.[4][5] After executing a small counterclockwise loop, Freda turned northeast.[4] On September 10, the JTWC and JMA, based on Dvorak analysis, estimated that Freda reached its peak wind spreed, with winds of 235 and 195\u00a0km/h (145 and 120\u00a0mph) respectively.[4][5] Typhoon Freda began to round the western periphery of a ridge, which caused the system to accelerate towards the north. The JTWC estimated that Freda weakened to a tropical storm during the evening hours of September 13;[4] however, the JMA maintained the storm at typhoon intensity for several additional days.[5] By September 16, Freda began to interact with a mid-level trough to the north, which resulted in a turn to the northeast. After bypassing Honshu, wind shear began to take toll on the system and Freda began to turn extratropical.[4] On September 17, the JTWC declared Freda extratropical,[4] with the JMA doing the same the following day. It was lasted noted on September 20.[5] Due to the storms erratic motion during its early stages, Guam received two distinct periods of heavy rainfall from the storm. On September 4, the typhoon dropped 109.3\u00a0mm (4.30\u00a0in), and four days later, 635\u00a0mm (25.0\u00a0in) was recorded on the island, along with gale-force winds.

A central dense overcast quickly developed,[4] and the JMA upgraded Holly into a severe tropical storm at noon on September 7 and a typhoon 12 hours later.[5] The JTWC also designated Holly a typhoon on September 7.[4] Following a 36-hour period of rapid deepening, the JMA estimated that Holly attained its peak intensity of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) midday on September 9.[5] Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated winds of 255\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), making Holly a super typhoon. Around this time, Holly veered from northwestward to northward caused by a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Holly steadily weakened as its forward motion decreased.[4] On September 14, the JMA downgraded Holly to a severe tropical storm,[5] while the JTWC estimated that Holly transitioned into a subtropical cyclone that day. the JTWC declared Holly an extratropical cyclone on September 15,[4] with the JMA following suit two days later. The remnants of the typhoon lost its identity late on September 17.[5] Throughout its lifetime, Typhoon Holly had no effects on land.[4]"

        "content": "Typhoon Ian began as broad and poorly organized tropical disturbance situated roughly 610\u00a0km (380\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Guam. At the time, the disturbance was embedded in the Western Pacific monsoon trough, which re-established itself after being disrupted by the previous tropical cyclone outbreak. Pressures in the area gradually fell start on September 21. Based on Dvorak classifications of T2.0/55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph),[4] the JMA and JTWC both classified the disturbance as a tropical depression early on September 23. At 18:00 UTC that day, both agencies upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Ian.[4][5] Tracking westward, Ian strengthened at a climatological rate of one T number per day.[4] After Ian turned to the northwest, the JMA upgraded Ian into a severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on September 25.[5] Despite lacking an inner core,[4] Ian was believed to have attained typhoon intensity that same day by both the JTWC and JMA,[4][5] and subsequently, entered a period of rapid deepening. The JTWC estimated that Ian deepened by 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) over the next 24 hours. Data from the JTWC indicated that Ian peaked in intensity at 00:00 UTC on September 26, with winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph).[4] The JMA suggested, however, the Ian's peak was much lower, with winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[5] While leveling off in intensity, Ian's forward motion decreased as it tracked northward. The storm's slow motion caused the typhoon to upwell cold water, which contributed to a decrease in cloud top temperatures around the eye. On September 29, Ian began to recurve out to sea, in response to a shortwave trough passing north of the typhoon.[4] The JMA downgraded Ian to a severe tropical storm that evening.[5] The JTWC estimated that Ian transitioned into a subtropical cyclone on October 1,[4] and the next day, Ian was downgraded into a tropical storm by the JMA.[5] On October 4, Ian finally dissipated over 2,000\u00a0km (1,245\u00a0mi) to the east of Japan.[4]"

Midday on September 30, Ian became to decelerate as the storm started a weakening trend. After briefly becoming quasi-stationary, Peke veered to the north-northeast, only to drift back to the southeast as the storm's low- and mid-level centers diverged.

Increased vertical wind shear caused the low-level center to become detached from the shower and thunderstorm activity and the JTWC issued their final warning on system at 00:00 UTC on October 1.[4] Despite this, the JMA estimated that June attained its peak intensity of 70\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) around this time.

The seventh typhoon and second super typhoon of the active typhoon season, it formed from the monsoon trough that spawned a tropical cyclone on August 8 while around positioned well to the east of the Philippines. It drifted northwestward, becoming a tropical storm on August\u00a09 and a typhoon on August\u00a010. Betty turned westward, where it rapidly intensified before attaining peak intensity on August\u00a011. The next day, Typhoon Betty made landfall in the central Philippines. Betty weakened rapidly over the country, but restrengthened somewhat over the South China Sea. Land interaction weakened Betty slightly before it hit central Vietnam on August\u00a016. The next day, Betty dissipated. Across the Philippines, Typhoon Betty brought widespread flooding, which resulted in severe destruction. Damage added up to $100\u00a0million (1987\u00a0USD). In the Maguindanao and Albay provinces alone, 10,000\u00a0people were evacuated and 1,000\u00a0were homeless. However, the capital city of Manila avoided any serious damage. Nationwide, around 200,000\u00a0people were reportedly homeless, 18,000\u00a0of winch were from Marinduque and another 11,400\u00a0resided on Mindoro Island. In the former, 4,000\u00a0dwellings sustained damage, and all of the banana crop there was lost. In all, 25,518\u00a0homes received damage. Roughly 400,000\u00a0people were directly affected by the storm. Overall, 85\u00a0people were killed and 324\u00a0others were wounded.

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Betty can be traced back to a tropical disturbance that was embedded in the monsoon trough on August 7, which extended from the Marshall Islands westward to the Philippines. Intensity estimates via the Dvorak technique yielded winds of 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) around 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Belau in the western Caroline Islands. Following a rapid increase in organization, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system early on August\u00a08.[2] Meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system.[3][nb 1] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Herming.[5] Early on August 9, Betty intensified into a tropical storm about 1,320\u00a0km (820\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Manila during the morning of August 9.[6][nb 2] Betty continued to intensify, and by midday, the storm attained winds of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph).[6] By the evening of August 9, the JMA upgraded Betty to a severe tropical storm.[3] At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010, both the JMA and JTWC believed that Betty attained typhoon intensity.[6] Tracking westward Betty began an episode of explosive deepening as expected by the JTWC.[2] At noon, the JTWC reported that Betty attained winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the United States Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). By 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a011, the agency upgraded Betty to an equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane.[6] Later that day, the JMA estimated that Betty attained its peak maximum sustained wind of 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 890\u00a0mbar (26\u00a0inHg). However, the JTWC indicated that the system was considerably stronger, with maximum sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). This concluded the storm intensification period; according to the JTWC, Betty strengthened 93\u00a0mbar (2.7\u00a0inHg) in a 37-hour time frame.[2] Furthermore, Betty was the deepest storm of the season,[3] and one of the most powerful storms ever recorded.[2] At peak, which it maintained for 12\u00a0hours,[6] Betty exhibited a small but well-defined eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops.[2] Thereafter, Betty began to weaken as it moved over the central Philippines. Accelerating, Betty continued on a westward track while passing south of a subtropical ridge. According to the JTWC, winds quickly decreased to 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), and by the time it emerged into the South China Sea early on August\u00a013, the typhoon's winds had diminished to 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), equivalent to a high-end Category 2 on the SSHWS.[2] The JMA estimated that Betty was slightly weaker, with winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[3] Moving west-northwest, Betty began to deepen over open water.[2] By midday, the JMA increased the intensity of Typhoon Betty to 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).[3] On the morning of August 14, the JTWC remarked that Betty reached its secondary peak intensity of 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph).[2] Despite this, intensity estimates from the JMA note that Betty did not intensify any further.[3] After attaining its secondary peak intensity, Betty began to deteriorate as it began to interact with Vietnam. After entering the Gulf of Tonkin, Betty made landfall 350\u00a0km (215\u00a0mi) south of Hanoi in northern Vietnam on August\u00a016.[2] At the time of landfall, the JMA estimated winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and the JTWC estimated winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[6] According to the JMA, Betty weakened to a tropical storm on evening of August\u00a016.[3] It then swept across Laos and eventually dissipated over northern Thailand near Chiang Mai during the evening of August\u00a017.[8]"

Sixty-one people died in the city of Sorsogon, where 98%\u00a0of all structures were either damaged or destroyed. Four hundred people died, 80%\u00a0of all crops were destroyed, and 90%\u00a0of all homes were either damaged or destroyed in the Sorsogon province. Nearby, in the Albay province, 73\u00a0people were killed. Throughout both the Albay and Sorsogon provinces, four-fifths\u00a0of all schools and half\u00a0of all public infrastructure were destroyed. Elsewhere, in Boac, 80%\u00a0of homes lost their roofs. In Bacacay, 18\u00a0of the village's 200\u00a0homes were destroyed. However, the capital city of Manila avoided the brunt of the typhoon. Throughout the Philippines, approximately 114,000\u00a0people sought shelter, approximately 90,000\u00a0houses were destroyed, leaving more than 150,000\u00a0homeless. Nationwide, damage from the storm totaled $54.5\u00a0million and 979\u00a0people perished."

        "content": "An area of convection developed within near the Marshall Islands in mid-November. Initially, convection waxed and waned, but on November\u00a017, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system. At this time, the system developed deep convection as well as good outflow. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 0100\u00a0UTC on November\u00a019 due to a significant increase in organization.[1] Five hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system.[2][nb 1] Continuing to rapidly become better organized while moving west-northwest, the cyclone was classified as a tropical depression by the JTWC at midday.[1] On the evening of November\u00a019, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm, prompting JTWC to name the system as Nina, shortly after developing banding features.[4][nb 2] Initially forecast by the JTWC to move slowly, instead, Nina accelerated while gradually intensifying. At 1600\u00a0UTC on November\u00a020, Tropical Storm Nina passed 75\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi; 40\u00a0nmi) south of Weno Island in the Chuuk Lagoon.[1] Two hours later, the JMA upgraded Nina to a severe tropical storm.[2] After moving away from the island on the morning of November\u00a021, the JTWC upgraded Nina to a typhoon at 1200\u00a0UTC,[1] with the JMA following suit early on November\u00a022.[2] Shortly thereafter, Nina made its closest approach to Ulithi, passing 110\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi; 60\u00a0nmi) to the north. At 1600 UTC, Nina tracked about 175\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi; 95\u00a0nmi) north of Yap.[1] Typhoon Nina accelerated slightly as it traversed the open waters of the Philippine Sea. The storm continued to slowly deepen, though early on November\u00a023, the system leveled off in intensity.[1] That day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Sisang, upon entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[6] However, midday on November\u00a024, Nina entered a phase of explosive intensification, at a rate of 1.33\u00a0mbar (0.039\u00a0inHg) an hour.[1] Despite this, the JMA only increased the intensity slightly to 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph; 90\u00a0kn).[2] After developing a well-defined eye, the JTWC reported that Nina attained its peak intensity of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph; 145\u00a0kn), making it a low-end Category\u00a05 system on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. At 1500\u00a0UTC on November\u00a025, Nina moved ashore as it made landfall along the southern tip of Luzon at its peak intensity.[1] Despite land interaction, little change in strength occurred until 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a026, at that time, the system began to weaken.[2] After traversing Luzon and Mindoro, the JTWC reduced the wind speed of the typhoon to 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h; 95\u00a0kn). Although no eye was visible on satellite imagery, radar imagery indicated that an eye was present, but cloud-filed; henceforth, the JTWC increased the intensity of Nina to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph; 100\u00a0kn), equivalent to a weak Category\u00a03 hurricane.[1] According to the JMA, however, Nina never re-intensified.[2] By 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a027, the low and mid level circulations began to decouple, deeply thwarting many JTWC forecasters. During this time, the cyclone posed a serious threat to Southern China and Hong Kong; but instead, Nina veered northward while gradually weakening;[1] by midday on November\u00a027, the JMA had reduced the intensity of Nina to 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph; 70\u00a0kn).[2] Early on November\u00a028, an eye once again became visible on satellite imagery. However, no re-intensification occurred. By the afternoon, increased wind shear took toll on the cyclone, causing Nina to become less organized due to deep convection being sheared off to the east-northeast. Thus, the JTWC expected Nina to move into the Luzon Straits and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. After meandering within the South China Sea, Nina turned south, before dissipating on November\u00a029;[1] though, the JMA continued to monitor its remnants until 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a030.[2]"

Part of the 2015\u201316 cyclone season, Fantala formed on 11 April to the south of Diego Garcia, an island in the central Indian Ocean. With a ridge to the south, the storm moved westward for several days while gaining strength, aided by warm waters and decreasing wind shear. Late on 17 April, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office on R\u00e9union (MFR) estimated peak 10-minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), making Fantala the strongest tropical cyclone of the basin in terms of 10-minute sustained winds. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1-minute winds of 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale, also the strongest on record in the South-West Indian Ocean, in terms of maximum sustained wind speed. Early on 18 April, Fantala reached its peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 910 millibars (27\u00a0inHg). While near peak intensity, Fantala passed near the Farquhar Group of the Seychelles, damaging most of the buildings in the small archipelago. Later on 18 April, Fantala had weakened to an intense tropical cyclone and slowed its forward motion, eventually reversing its direction of movement. After fluctuating in strength, the disorganized system reversed direction again, making its closest approach to Madagascar. Fantala degenerated into a remnant low on 24 April, and the remnants continued toward Tanzania. There, heavy rainfall resulted in flooding that washed away roads and houses, killing 13\u00a0people. Rains extended further into Kenya, with similar effects."

        "content": "On 9 April, an area of disturbed weather persisted to the southeast of Diego Garcia. The system moved generally westward, steered by a ridge, and a low-level circulation gradually became more defined. Limiting factors to faster development included poor inflow and moderate wind shear, although associated convection became more organized. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on 11 April, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in La R\u00e9union (MFR) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 8 about 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) south of Diego Garcia.[2] Six hours later, the agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression.[3] At 13:00\u00a0UTC on 11 April, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, noting the increased organization of the convection, circulation, and outflow.[4] Later that day, the MFR upgraded the depression to Moderate Tropical Storm Fantala,[5] and the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 19S. By that time, the convection was quickly consolidating around the center, organizing into a circular central dense overcast.[6] On 12 April, the previously detrimental wind shear began easing, allowing the structure to become more symmetric.[7] On that day, an eye feature began developing in the center of Fantala, indicative of strengthening.[8] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on 12 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to severe tropical storm status,[9] and six hours later, the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, with 1\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph); rapid strengthening was prevented by the entrainment of nearby dry air,[10] although the core of convection continued to contract.[11] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on 13 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to tropical cyclone status, with 10\u00a0minute winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[12] By that time, the eye feature persisted, consisting of a warm area within the deepest convection,[13] although the dry air in the region prevented quicker strengthening.[14] By early on 14 April, the eye became better defined after an eyewall replacement cycle.[15] The intensity fluctuated after outflow decreased to the north, although increasingly warm waters favored further intensification.[16] Early on 15 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to an intense tropical cyclone,[17] as the storm rapidly deepened.[18] The outflow was enhanced by a large upper-level low well to the southeast, and shear had decreased to a minimum.[19] After reaching an initial peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) at 12:00\u00a0UTC that day, Fantala's intensity leveled off for the following 48 hours, with its 10-minute sustained winds fluctuating between 195 and 215\u00a0km/h (120 and 130\u00a0mph).[12] On 16 April, Fantala turned more to the west-northward toward the southern islands of the Seychelles, steered by a strengthening ridge near Madagascar.[20] Intensification resumed by 12:00\u00a0UTC on the following day, with the JTWC estimating 1-minute sustained winds of 270\u00a0km/h (165\u00a0mph), classifying Fantala as a Category 5-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Around 15:00\u00a0UTC, the cyclone moved through the Farquhar Group of the Seychelles, and its eyewall moved over several small islands. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on 17 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to a very intense tropical cyclone; based on a Dvorak T-number of T7.5, the satellite-derived wind estimate was 10-minute sustained winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), along with an estimated barometric pressure of 910\u00a0mbar (910.0\u00a0hPa; 26.87\u00a0inHg).[21] However, in the best track for Fantala, the MFR concluded that Fantala had been a very intense tropical cyclone 6 hours earlier as well, with 10-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), and that the storm's peak intensity and minimum central pressure of 910\u00a0mbar (910\u00a0hPa; 27\u00a0inHg) had occurred 18 hours after that time, at 06:00\u00a0UTC on 18 April.[12] The JTWC also estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph). While maintaining peak intensity, Fantala's forward movement slowed, as the ridge to its south over Madagascar weakened.[22] The cyclone turned back to the southeast due to the building influence of a ridge to the northeast, and the storm retraced its former path. Cooler waters along its path[23] \u2013 the result of upwelling[24] \u2013 as well as another eyewall replacement cycle,[25] caused Fantala to weaken to an intense tropical cyclone by 19 April.[12][23] Fantala had maintained at least Category 4-equivalent intensity for about 90 hours, and of those 90 hours, Fantala spent about 30 hours at both very intense tropical cyclone status and Category 5-equivalent intensity.[12][26] That day, the eye disappeared on satellite imagery and the storm deteriorated further to tropical cyclone status.[27] The eye redeveloped on 20 April, with pronounced outflow assisting in the re-intensification,[28] although increased shear resulted in weakening again on 21 April.[29] That day, the MFR downgraded Fantala to a severe tropical storm.[30] The structure improved again on 22 April as the system stalled due to the building ridge to the south.[31] At 00:00\u00a0UTC that day, the MFR upgraded Fantala to an intense tropical cyclone once the eye became more pronounced again,[32] only to downgrade it to tropical cyclone status by 06:00\u00a0UTC,[33] though this was pushed back to 12:00\u00a0UTC in the best track.[12] A small area of convection persisted over the center, although dry air in the region continued to weaken the thunderstorms.[34] The MFR again downgraded Fantala to a severe tropical storm on 23 April, as the storm began drifting to the northwest.[35] Increasing wind shear weakened Fantala further to a moderate tropical storm that day,[36] and on 24 April, both the JTWC and MFR issued their final advisories; the latter agency had first downgraded it to a tropical depression. By that time, the circulation was exposed from the convection as Fantala moved over cooled waters where it traversed a few days prior.[37][38] The circulation continued to the northwest, with occasional flares of convection.[39] By 27 April, a circulation was no longer present as the convective remnants of Fantala approached the coastline of Tanzania.[40]"

Government officials forced all 72\u00a0residents on the South Island to evacuate to the North Island, and strongly advised fishermen to avoid sailing.[41] Fantala was the first tropical cyclone to threaten the Farquhar Group since Cyclone Bondo in 2006.[42] Most of the 34\u00a0residents on Farquhar Atoll evacuated ahead of the storm, and those that remained behind were uninjured.[43] While moving through the Seychelles near peak intensity, Fantala had estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), and days later it moved through the region again with 10-minute sustained winds estimated at 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph).[12] Based on satellite imagery, it was estimated that of the 50\u00a0structures on Farquhar Atoll, 19 were destroyed and 27 sustained severe damage. Only four buildings, which were constructed to be cyclone-proof after Bondo, withstood the estimated 350\u00a0km/h (220\u00a0mph) gusts, even then suffering moderate damage.[44] In addition, many of the island's trees were knocked down.[45] Due to the storm's prolonged passage through the island group, the Seychelles government declared the Farquhar islands as a disaster area on 20 April.[45] In a visit to the Seychelles, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that the country has become \"highly vulnerable to storm surges, as we are reminded by the recent devastating effects of Cyclone Fantala.\"[46] A World Bank survey team found $4.5 million in damage.[1] The lodge on the island was not expected to be rebuilt until March 2017, about 11 months after the storm.[47] In April 2017, the development of two new islands in Farquhar's lagoon was attributed to the cyclone.[48] The remnants of Fantala spurred warnings from the Tanzania Meteorological Agency after the storm produced heavy rainfall.[49] In Kilimanjaro Region, the rains caused flooding that covered roads and entered houses, trapping hundreds of residents and killing eight. Officials required helicopters from nearby Kilimanjaro National Park to rescue residents. Five people were killed in the country's Morogoro Region, all drowning in flooded rivers.[50][51] The overflowing Umba River isolated several villages.[52] In the region, 13,933\u00a0people were left homeless after 315\u00a0houses were washed away. Flooding also washed away 12,073\u00a0ha (29,830 acres) of crop fields, prompting officials to purchase and distribute maize, beans, and cooking oil to affected residents.[50][51] The storm also sent a plume of moisture northward to Kenya, where storm-influenced rainfall reached 133\u00a0mm (5.2\u00a0in) in Kwale in just four hours. This resulted in flooding in coastal portions of Kenya that destroyed several houses. About 10,000\u00a0ha (25,000 acres) of crop fields were flooded. The port and several roads were closed in the city of Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city.[52]"

        "content": "Typhoon Lynn, more commonly known in the Philippines as Typhoon Pepang,[1] was responsible for the worst flooding in Taiwan in 40\u00a0years. Typhoon Lynn originated from an area of disturbed weather in the central north Pacific in mid-October\u00a01987. On October\u00a015, the system was upgraded into a tropical storm.  Moving west-northwest, it slowly deepened over the next few days, though the intensification process briefly stopped on October\u00a015. Two days later, Lynn was upgraded into a typhoon, while passing northwest of Guam. Lynn maintained low-end typhoon strength until October\u00a019, when the storm began to rapidly intensify. On October\u00a021, Lynn attained its peak intensity while tracking towards the west. Weakening then commenced soon after Lynn interacted with Luzon. However, the core of the typhoon remained well offshore both the Philippines and Taiwan. On October\u00a025, Lynn weakened to a severe tropical storm. Three days later, it dissipated, though its remains later brought rain to China. While passing near Guam, power was knocked out and 40\u00a0residents were evacuated. Throughout the Mariana Islands, 15\u00a0families were rendered homeless and damage totaled $2\u00a0million (1987\u00a0USD). After brushing Luzon, seven people perished, over 30,000\u00a0homes were damaged, 100\u00a0houses were destroyed, and 7,000\u00a0individuals were left homeless. Damage in the Philippines totaled to $25.3\u00a0million. Even though Lynn passed a bit south of Taiwan, the storm brought widespread damage to the nation. Nine children were swept away and killed on a field trip, while another 72\u00a0survived and were evacuated. In Taipei, 13\u00a0persons perished and 2,230\u00a0people were rescued. Lynn was considered the worst tropical cyclone to affect the city in four decades. Nationwide, 168,000\u00a0people lost power and 42\u00a0casualties occurred."

        "content": "Typhoon Lynn originated from a broad, poorly organized area of convection situated within the monsoon trough roughly 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) north-northeast of the Marshall Islands in the middle of October\u00a01987. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the system on October\u00a014,[2] and later that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit.[3][nb 1] Following an increase in convection and outflow, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system at 0300\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015 about 670\u00a0km (415\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Pohnpei of the eastern Carolina Islands at the time. Three hours later, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Storm Lynn based on Dvorak estimates of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[2] At midday, the JMA followed suit and upgraded the system into a tropical storm.[3] Tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge, the cyclone decelerated.[2] Lynn gradually intensified, though this process briefly halted on October\u00a017.[5][nb 2] Early the next day, the JMA reported that Lynn had deepened into a severe tropical storm.[3] Shortly thereafter, radar data and satellite imagery revealed the formation of an eye 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi) in diameter, and thus the JTWC upgraded Lynn into a typhoon, though post-storm analysis noted that Lynn could have been a typhoon before then.[2] Also around this time, the JMA designated Lynn as a typhoon.[3] At midday, Lynn made its closest approach to Guam, passing around 150\u00a0km (95\u00a0mi) northeast of the island. Three hours later, Lynn passed 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) southwest of Tinian before proceeding west-northwest.[2] After moving away from the Mariana Islands,[2] Lynn initially maintained its intensity, but on August 19,[3] it began to rapidly intensify. Later that day, the JTWC upgraded Lynn to a super typhoon[2] and early on August\u00a020, Typhoon Lynn attained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) according to the JMA.[3] After leveling off in intensity for roughly 24\u00a0hours, the JMA estimates that Lynn reached its peak intensity of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg).[3] At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021, the JTWC indicated that Lynn reached its peak intensity of 255\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. According to the JTWC, Typhoon Lynn was the third typhoon in 1987 to attain such intensity.[2] Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Pepang.[1] Shortly after attaining maximum intensity, Lynn began to track westward while steadily weakening. Initially, the JTWC predicted Lynn to take a more west-northwesterly course, but the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) correctly predicted Lynn to move due west due to a subtropical ridge situated north of the cyclone.[2] On October\u00a022, the JMA indicated that Lynn leveled off in intensity, though at 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a023, the cyclone deteriorated slightly. Roughly 24\u00a0hours later, the JMA reduced the intensity of Lynn to 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph);[3] by this time, the typhoon entered the Luzon Straits. Over the next two days, Lynn interacted with mountainous terrain of the Philippines; however, at its closest approach, the core of the system remained over 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) offshore.[2] Meanwhile, the weakening process accelerated, and on October\u00a025, the JMA reported that Lynn was no longer a typhoon.[3] Furthermore, the storm exited PAGASA's warning zone.[7] Increased wind shear took toll on Lynn, and the next day, satellite imagery indicated that all of the storm's deep convection was confined north-northeast of the center. At 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027, the JTWC ceased watching the system,[2] though the JMA continued tracking it until the morning of August 28.[3] The remnants of the storm later brought showers to China.[2]"

Moreover, 154.4\u00a0mm (6.08\u00a0in) of rain fell at a nearby air force base.[2] Power was briefly knocked out for the entire island,[16] though by October\u00a020, electricity had been restored to most of the island.[17] Around 40\u00a0residents were evacuated to shelter along low-lying areas.[18] Several homes sustained serious damages while many others suffered roof damage.[19] The banana and papaya crops were largely destroyed by the typhoon,[20] but damage to other crops was minimal.[17] No one in Guam was injured by Lynn.[21] After passing near Saipan, winds of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) and gusts of 121\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) were observed. All commercial flights to and from the island, as well as all schools and government offices, were cancelled on both October\u00a019 and 20. Both Saipan and Rota experienced island-wide power outages on the evening of October\u00a018.[2] Saipan bore the most significant effects from the cyclone; four people were hurt and two homes were destroyed. Several homes and office buildings on the island were also damaged.[22] Elsewhere, around 10\u00a0families fled to shelter as a result of strong winds.[18] Although damage in Rota was minor,[19] the island of Tinian received considerable damage and all of the island's 2,000\u00a0residents were briefly left without electricity. Heavy rains resulted in flooding that destroyed several dwellings and deluged many more.[23] Throughout the Mariana Islands, agriculture damage was estimated at $2\u00a0million (1987\u00a0USD) and 15\u00a0families were displaced from their homes. Roughly 100\u00a0people sought help from the Red Cross.[17] A few weeks later, the Northern Marianas Islands were declared a major disaster area by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).[24]"

        "content": "Hurricane Grace was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Grace impacted much of the Leeward Islands and Greater Antilles as a tropical storm, before causing more substantial impacts in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Veracruz as a hurricane. It was the seventh named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a tropical wave in the Main Development Region, the primitive system tracked west-northwest across the Atlantic Ocean towards the Antilles, becoming a tropical depression on August 14. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Grace later the same day, but weakened back to a depression due to an unfavorable environment. After moving near Haiti as a tropical depression, it strengthened back to a tropical storm and became a hurricane on August 18, reaching an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.12\u00a0inHg). It weakened back to a tropical storm after its landfall in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche, entering a very favorable environment for intensification hours later. Grace then rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) in about 24 hours. The storm made its final landfall in the state of Veracruz at peak intensity and quickly degenerated into a remnant low over mainland Mexico on August 21; however, its remnants later regenerated into Tropical Storm Marty in the Eastern Pacific on August 23. In Haiti, Grace exacerbated effects from an earthquake three days prior to the passage of the storm. Streets were flooded and power outages were reported in Jamaica. In Mexico, the storm caused landslides and destroyed buildings. In total, Grace killed 16 people: 4 in Haiti and 12 in Mexico. The storm caused an estimated $513 million (2021 USD) in damages.[1][2]"

        "content": "Grace originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August\u00a09.[1] On August\u00a010, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical disturbance near the Cabo Verde Islands.[3] A Tropical Weather Outlook on the following day noted that the system was producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.[3] However, environmental conditions were becoming more conductive for development, and by August\u00a013, the system was designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Seven while located about 840 miles (1,350\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands.[4][5] By 06:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Seven approximately 480 miles (770\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands.[6] After the cyclone was found to have tropical storm-force winds on August\u00a014 at 09:00\u00a0UTC, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, naming it Grace.[7] However, strong wind shear caused Grace to weaken back to a tropical depression on August\u00a015.[8] It made landfall as a tropical depression in the Barahona Peninsula at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016.[9] Continuing west-northwestward, Grace brushed the south coast of Haiti early on August\u00a017.[10] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August 17, Grace was upgraded to a tropical storm southwest of Haiti, after a reconnaissance flight observed tropical storm-force winds.[11] Approximately 11\u00a0hours later, Grace made landfall in Jamaica near Annotto Bay, Saint Mary Parish, with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[12] After re-emerging into the Caribbean late on August\u00a017, Grace continued to intensify due to favorable conditions and rapidly organized as it passed south of the Cayman Islands.[13] By 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018, A Hurricane Hunters flight found that Grace had intensified into a Category 1 hurricane.[14] The storm reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg) early on August 19.[15][16] At 09:45\u00a0UTC on that day, Grace made its first landfall at that intensity near Tulum, Quintana Roo.[17] Shortly after, the storm weakened to a strong tropical storm.[18] After nearly 12\u00a0hours over land, Grace emerged into the Bay of Campeche.[19] The storm then began reintensifying, becoming a hurricane again by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020.[20] Thereafter, Grace underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category\u00a02 hurricane by 00:00\u00a0UTC on August 21.[21] Within the next three hours, the storm became a Category 3 hurricane.[22] Around 05:30\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021, Grace made another landfall in Mexico near Tecolutla, Veracruz, at peak intensity, with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 967\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg);[1] this was the strongest landfall in the state's history. Operationally, Grace was assessed to have been even stronger at landfall, with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 962\u00a0mbar (28.4\u00a0inHg),[23] which would have tied it with Hurricane Karl of 2010 as the most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the Bay of Campeche by maximum sustained winds;[24] however, it was downgraded slightly in post-season reanalysis. After landfall, it rapidly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane over the mountainous terrain of Mexico.[25] The storm continued to rapidly weaken over the rough terrain and was downgraded to a tropical storm three hours later.[26] At 21:00\u00a0UTC, Grace degenerated into a tropical disturbance over Mexico, and its low-level circulation dissipated.[1][27] The mid-level center and remnants of Grace would later redevelop into Tropical Storm Marty in the Eastern Pacific on August 23.[28][1] Marty was short-lived, as it degenerated into a remnant low on August 24.[29]"

        "content": "According to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, the 1915\u00a0New Orleans hurricane began as a weak tropical storm moving across the southern Windward Islands on September\u00a021, 1915.[1][2] Its tropical cyclogenesis was determined via analysis of atmospheric observations from the surrounding islands, though shipping in the region would confirm the storm's existence the following day.[1] Tracking slowly towards the west, the nascent tropical cyclone gradually strengthened, reaching hurricane intensity by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023. This steady phase of intensification would continue unhindered as the hurricane progressed across the Caribbean Sea, allowing the storm to reach major hurricane strength on September\u00a024. At 12:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the cyclone's maximum sustained winds crested at 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), making it a powerful Category\u00a04 hurricane if rated using the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale; the storm would maintain winds of this scale for over three days.[2] One ship observation, estimated to have been likely taken late on September\u00a025, documented a barometric pressure of 931\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.50\u00a0inHg). This pressure reading would stand as the lowest taken during the hurricane's lifespan, and also suggested that the storm's initially assessed intensity\u2014equivalent to a modern-day Category\u00a02 hurricane\u2014was significantly underestimated.[1] As the cyclone passed south of Jamaica, it curved towards the northwest, taking it towards the Yucat\u00e1n Channel.[3] By September\u00a028, the storm had entered the Gulf of Mexico.[2] The hurricane maintained its gradual forward speed and fairly steady intensity as it approached the Louisiana coast.[2] As the cyclone neared land, it entered a denser area of shipping traffic, allowing the storm's intensity to be more readily assessed.[1] Slight weakening occurred as the storm moved over shallower continental shelf waters, leading up to the hurricane's landfall on the Gulf coast of Louisiana at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029. The hurricane's strongest winds upon landfall were estimated to measure 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h), correlating with the upper-end of a Category\u00a03 rating on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Near the time of landfall, the hurricane was documented as having a central pressure of 952\u00a0mbar (952\u00a0hPa; 28.1\u00a0inHg) at Tulane University.[1] At the time, this was the lowest pressure ever recorded in the United States.[4] Using this measurement, the Atlantic reanalysis project calculated that the hurricane struck Louisiana with a lower pressure: 944\u00a0mbar (944\u00a0hPa; 27.9\u00a0inHg). Analysis of onshore observations also suggested that the storm made landfall with concentric eyewalls.[1] Although the moist swampland of the Louisianan Acadiana allowed the hurricane to maintain strength longer than what would otherwise be expected,[1] the storm would eventually succumb to land interaction. Rapid weakening ensued as the cyclone moved inland, degrading back into a tropical storm within twelve hours of landfall.[2] As it entered Mississippi, the storm began to interact with a quasi-stationary front. This resulted in the formation of a new low-pressure center and denoted the transition from a tropical to extratropical cyclone at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030;[5] and these remnants advanced northeastward into the Mid-Atlantic states before they were last noted on October\u00a01 over Pennsylvania.[2]"

Some winds were strong enough to cut telecommunications between Kingston and the outlying districts of the island nation.[8] The hurricane's brushing of Jamaica led in part to raising cotton prices to a yearly high.[9] Offshore, the United Fruit steamer Almirante sustained considerable damage but was able to return safely to Port Royal.[10] Ships sailing for the Yucat\u00e1n Channel and in western Cuban waters were warned to exercise extreme caution following the hurricane's passage of Jamaica.[11] Winds peaked at 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) in Havana, Cuba as the storm passed through the channel well to the city's west.[12]"

That afternoon, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico from Pensacola, Florida to New Orleans, Louisiana. Extensive efforts to communicate the imminent threat the hurricane posed began in earnest following the issuance of warnings for the area, with public interests being advised that the approaching storm could be stronger than the 1909 Grand Isle hurricane, which served as New Orleans' strongest documented tropical cyclone at the time. Warnings continued into September\u00a029, and local emergency offices enforced strict curfews for New Orleans as landfall approached; meteorologist Isaac Cline stated in an entry to the Monthly Weather Review that the effective dissemination of warnings and strict enforcement of curfew \"unquestionably\" mitigated additional loss of life in the city.[13]"

        "content": "As the hurricane traversed the Gulf of Mexico from September\u00a028 to September\u00a029,[2] it produced rough surf along its path. The cutter Miami was caught in the storm, but was able to use a heavily damaged ship as an anchor before resuming its trek towards Key West, Florida.[14] Storm surge and rough seas produced by the hurricane along the Louisiana coast arrived shortly before the storm made landfall. Evacuees departing the coast as late as September\u00a028 reported no abnormal tides along the shore. However, sea levels began to rise at abnormally rapid rates on the morning of September\u00a029 as the hurricane neared. By the afternoon hours, low-lying lands south of New Orleans and east towards Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, as well as areas adjacent to Lake Pontchartrain, were inundated by the quickly rising storm surge. Levee overtopping along Lake Pontchartrain resulted in the flooding of much of western New Orleans. Parts of Carrollton, New Orleans were submerged under as much as 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) of water due to the levee failure, and much of this inundation remained for up to four days as the city's drainage system slowly drained the floodwaters; in other locations, floodwaters receded rapidly. At its height, the surge was estimated to have crested between 15 and 20\u00a0ft (4.6 and 6.1\u00a0m) in height, setting a record for the highest tide reported in the region. Ocean swells topped levees along the Mississippi River and progressed well upstream; at the confluence of the Harvey Canal and the Mississippi River nearly 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) from the Gulf of Mexico, the river swelled to 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) above normal. Elsewhere, waves 10\u201312\u00a0ft (3.0\u20133.7\u00a0m) above normal high tide were reported along the same river.[13] Upon making landfall, onshore anemometers documented winds stronger than had been recorded in any previous hurricane along the United States Gulf Coast. Gusts as high as 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) were reported in New Orleans, with five-minute sustained winds peaking at 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h).[13] In Burrwood, Louisiana, a Weather Bureau anemometer documented peak five-minute sustained windspeeds of 122\u00a0mph (196\u00a0km/h), though when the abnormally high bias of the era's anemometers and adjustment to the more standard one-minute sustained measure are accounted for, this yields a speed of 99\u00a0mph (159\u00a0km/h).[1] The intense winds caused extensive damage across New Orleans, where nearly every building sustained damage.[13] The French Market was partly demolished, while the roof of a prominent Masonic temple partially collapsed.[15] Combined with powerful waves, the winds resulted in the sinking of four small steamers at the Port of New Orleans, in addition to several coal barges. A number of other steamers and small craft were blown from bayous and bays onto dry land.[13] The winds also caused widespread power outages, cutting telecommunications to and from the city,[16] and putting over 8000\u00a0telephones out of commission. Electric lighting was also disabled by the storm following the failure of city's power station.[15] Damage to city-owned property in New Orleans was appraised at nearly US$500,000, though the total amount of damage to all public and private property in the city was estimated to have been at least ten times greater at US$5\u00a0million. Damage to shipping along the Mississippi River in and around New Orleans was estimated at US$1.75\u00a0million.[13] Following the storm's passage, rail service to New Orleans was suspended.[15] Roofs were blown off buildings and the Presbyt\u00e8re on Jackson Square lost its cupola. The clock on St. Louis Cathedral stopped at 5:50pm, the height of the storm. The hurricane damaged the Times-Picayune building, hampering newspaper production. More church steeples in the city were blown down or significantly damaged than remained intact.[17] The landmark Presbyterian Church on Lafayette Square collapsed, as did St. Anna's Episcopal Church on Esplanade Avenue. Half the rides at Spanish Fort were destroyed. Horticultural Hall in Audubon Park was destroyed. Wind damage was worse than the most recent previous hurricane to hit the city in 1909, but flooding was much less widespread; however, there were reports of waters from Lake Pontchartrain being forced backwards into the city's drainage canals by the storm, an event which would be repeated more catastrophically with Hurricane Katrina 90 years later. After power to drainage pumps failed, parts of the Mid-City neighborhood suffered significant flooding. Only 21 of the storm-related deaths were within the city.[citation needed] The hurricane also caused significant damage in areas around New Orleans, including the destruction of 90%\u00a0of buildings destroyed along Lake Pontchartrain. Only one house remained standing in Leeville, Louisiana; similar destruction occurred between Golden Meadow, Louisiana and Cut Off, Louisiana, where 100\u00a0houses were demolished.[13] In Morgan City, Louisiana, winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) blew down wires and crippled communication.[19] The total damage to infrastructure in areas surrounding New Orleans was estimated at US$6.5\u00a0million. The heaviest rain fell within an area 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) east of the center, though heavy rainfall occurred throughout the eastern half of the tropical cyclone as it moved inland.[13] Franklin, Louisiana measured the highest rainfall associated with the storm with a reading of 14.43\u00a0in (36.7\u00a0cm); on September\u00a030, 10.28\u00a0in (26.1\u00a0cm) of rain fell in Franklin, setting a September 24-hour rainfall record for the city.[4] Precipitation spread ahead of the hurricane as it interacted with a stationary front draped over the Southeastern United States, causing widespread rainfall totals in excess of 3\u00a0in (7.6\u00a0cm) across much of Mississippi and Alabama.[5]\nA 13-foot (4.0\u00a0m) storm surge rolled into St. Bernard Parish, the Rigolets, and the Lake Catherine area. Areas along the Lower Coast (south of New Orleans) were hit even harder than the city. A telegraph report states the situation: Whole country between Poydras and Buras inundated. Levees gone, property loss appalling. Life toll probably heavy. Conditions estimated worse than ever before. Relief needed. No communications... There were 23 dead in Venice, Louisiana, with similar numbers in coastal towns of Frenier and LaBranche. Plaquemines Parish experienced the worst fatalities with deaths estimated at over 200; the bodies of some victims were never found. In Plaquemines Parish, there was severe flooding and miles of levees were washed away. Thousands of people were left homeless. The hurricane also wrecked many of the oyster boats, damaging the local economy. Some communities, including Breton Island and the town of Saint Malo, were completely destroyed. Though it was not as deadly as the 1893 Chenier Caminanda hurricane, this hurricane was the deadliest Louisiana hurricane until Betsy 50 years later."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane King were from a tropical depression that developed just off the north coast of Honduras on October\u00a013.[1] It was a small system throughout its duration, and initially moved toward the east and east-northeast.[2] At the time, the system was considered a weak and broad depression, producing convection, or thunderstorms, from Honduras to western Cuba.[3] It tracked to the east-northeast, becoming a tropical storm on October\u00a014. The system was later given the name \"King\" from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet.[2] The tropical storm slowly intensified as it tracked toward Cuba, and on October\u00a016, King attained hurricane status while passing between Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. It quickly intensified that day, and at 22:00\u00a0UTC, the hurricane made landfall just west of Camag\u00fcey with winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h).[1][4] The hurricane remained small, as the city of Camag\u00fcey reported peak winds of only 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[2] Within twelve hours, Hurricane King crossed central Cuba, during which it weakened into a minimal hurricane. After entering the Florida Straits, King quickly re-intensified,[1] and Hurricane Hunters indicated maximum winds of 100 to 105\u00a0mph (161 to 169\u00a0km/h) over water. At the time, the barometric pressure was 988\u00a0mb (29.2\u00a0inHg), and the eye was 20 miles (32\u00a0km) in diameter. The hurricane quickly intensified as it turned north-northwestward.[2] Early on October\u00a018, King attained major hurricane status; it was the sixth and final major hurricane of the season.[1] In 24\u00a0hours, the pressure dropped 33.2\u00a0mb (0.98\u00a0inHg) and the eye contracted to just 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) in diameter.[2] At 05:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a018, Hurricane King made landfall near Grove Isle, Coconut Grove, a short distance west of downtown Miami, with peak winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h), making it a Category 4 hurricane\u2014the fifth in South Florida since 1945.[1][5] A private barometer in Miami measured the storm's central pressure, 28.20\u00a0inHg (955\u00a0mb).[6] The Miami Weather Bureau office, which was struck by the eastern eyewall, recorded sustained winds of 122\u00a0mph (196\u00a0km/h) with gusts estimated at 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[2] Over land, the compact hurricane\u2014its eye attended by a half-hour-long lull in the Miami area[6]\u2014weakened as it continued through the state, though its eye was still well defined over Broward County, as celestial bodies such as stars and the Moon were seen during its passage.[7] At the time of its closest approach to Fort Lauderdale, King was still a major hurricane, the most recent on record to affect the city.[8] After crossing Lake Okeechobee, Hurricane King passed near the city of Okeechobee, which recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 28.85\u00a0inHg (977\u00a0mb). The winds diminished along the southern and western side of the storm, although winds gusted to hurricane force in many locations in eastern coastal Florida.[2] Early on October\u00a019, King weakened to tropical storm status over north-central Florida, and later that day weakened further into a tropical depression over western Georgia. King curved northwestward, dissipating over Alabama on October\u00a020.[1]"

About 18\u00a0hours before landfall, the alert was replaced by a hurricane warning. The advance warning time was believed to have prevented many deaths; however, the population was considered complacent with the warning, causing additional damage when they executed improper preparations, such as securing windows.[2] Due to its compactness, the storm initially confounded attempts to gauge its intensity, and so forecasters were taken aback by reports of its strength from the Miami area.[14] Hurricane King struck Miami around midnight local time with a very compact area of strong winds. Its eye was about 5.2 miles (8.4\u00a0km) in diameter; the western edge of the eye moved across Miami International Airport, which reported wind gusts of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h), and the eastern side struck the Miami Weather Bureau office, which recorded sustained winds of 122\u00a0mph (196\u00a0km/h). The principal damage zone was sharply-defined in an area 14 miles (23\u00a0km) in diameter; the boundaries of the damage resembled the path of a tornado, although a subsequent analysis indicated the majority of the damage was not tornadic in nature.[2] There was one confirmed report of a damaging tornado in Davie.[13] As it made landfall, Hurricane King produced lightning near its center, which was the first confirmed occurrence in Florida;[2] thunder was also heard at the time.[15] The Weather Bureau considered King the severest hurricane to hit Miami in more than 24\u00a0years.[2] Across Florida, damage totaled $27.75\u00a0million (1950\u00a0USD), of which $15\u00a0million was in the Miami metropolitan area.[2] The hurricane damaged 20,861\u00a0houses in southern Florida, 580 of them severely. Additionally, 248\u00a0trailer homes were damaged, 188 of them severely. A total of 248\u00a0houses or trailers were destroyed in the Miami area.[16] A preliminary survey indicated there were about 2,000\u00a0store windows that were broken during the storm.[13] In Broward County aluminum jalousies were bent and shorn of paint, a home was stripped of half its roof tiles, and all but one fruit tree were downed on a property.[7] Intense winds felled about a dozen radio towers in the Miami metropolitan area, flipped six airplanes at Miami International Airport, and tore the roofs off several hundred structures. Most homes in the worst-hit areas lost all or most of their roofing, damage to structures was significant, and many palm trees were splintered. Up to 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) of water inundated sections of Miami Beach and left behind deep layers of sand in the rooms and lobbies of dozens of hotels. Strong winds nearby flipped automobiles as well, and businesses and homes on South Beach were wrecked.[17] In West Hollywood, a town of 2,000\u00a0people located north of Miami, strong winds destroyed or severely damaged about 150\u00a0houses, leaving hundreds homeless. At the Broward County airport in Fort Lauderdale, the winds damaged 55\u00a0buildings and destroyed one plane. Further north, damage was lighter in Palm Beach, consisting of downed trees and flooded streets.[18] Along its path through the state, strong winds were observed around Lake Okeechobee, with 93-mile-per-hour (150\u00a0km/h) gusts in Clewiston.[2] In Orlando, the winds destroyed the roof of an airport hangar.[13] In central Florida, the hurricane caused widespread damage to crops and properties.[2] Damage to the grapefruit crop was heaviest in the region along the Indian River, where losses were expected to reach 30%. The orange crop was not as affected, and no area reported total losses at more than 5%. Losses to the citrus crop were considered better than initially anticipated.[19] Overall, the citrus crop damage totaled about $3\u00a0million,[13] with 2.5\u00a0million boxes destroyed.[20] Additionally, the hurricane flooded about 20.3\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (53\u00a0km2) of vegetable fields around Lake Okeechobee.[13] Near Pompano, high winds and rain caused heavy losses to crops planted during early autumn, including snap beans, lima beans, cucumbers, eggplant, pepper, and squash; most of the crops required replanting. Elsewhere, the snap bean and sweet corn crops were severely damaged around the Everglades, and farms around Fort Pierce experienced heavy losses to the tomato crop.[21] Intense rainbands spread across the state's eastern coastline; Hillsboro Inlet Light near Fort Lauderdale recorded sustained winds of 91\u00a0mph (146\u00a0km/h), and St. Augustine Light recorded a gust of 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). Further inland, Jacksonville reported sustained winds of 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h).[2] Cape Canaveral, Melbourne, and Jupiter reported hurricane-force winds as well.[17] In Jacksonville, Hurricane King left widespread power outages due to the winds knocking over trees and power lines. Street flooding was reported, and around 30\u00a0families required evacuation due to the storm.[13] Between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach, the storm generated 8-foot (2.4\u00a0m) tides, flooding many homes along the Halifax River. Surging waters also caused a dike to collapse at Sebastian Inlet and flooded the Titusville area.[22] Packinghouses and docks were wrecked on the Indian River, and seawalls were washed out at Cocoa Beach; up and down the east coast of the state a number of causeways and bridges were eroded. The cities of DeLand and Daytona Beach deemed the storm their worst in several years.[23] At Clewiston, the storm generated tides of up to 19.3\u00a0ft (5.9\u00a0m), and hurricane-force winds swept the eastern side of Lake Okeechobee.[24] Overall, there were 50\u00a0injuries in the state,[13] as well as at least three deaths.[2] Two of them\u00a0\u2013 a woman in West Hollywood and a man in Hallandale\u00a0\u2013 were killed when their houses collapsed from the strong winds. The third death occurred in Sanford when a boy drowned in a flooded stream. There were also unconfirmed reports of a fourth person drowning when his boat capsized west of Bunnell.[13] The hurricane was one of two major hurricanes\u00a0\u2013 a Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale\u00a0\u2013 to hit the state in 1950. It was the first time on record that two storms of such intensity hit Florida in the same year, and has only been repeated since in 2004 with hurricanes Charley and Jeanne, and in 2005 with hurricanes Dennis and Wilma.[1]"

Insurance companies paid about $1\u00a0million to compensate for the storm damage.[26] Due to the loss in citrus crop, prices briefly increased, although they returned to normal levels by late October.[27] The name King was not used again after the season, although it was on the naming list for 1951 and 1952 due to being part of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. The Phonetic Alphabet was decommissioned in 1953 in favor of using female names.[1] Based on population growth in south Florida, it is estimated that a storm identical to Hurricane King would cause $2.8\u00a0billion in insured damage if it struck in 2001, with the total roughly split between Broward and Miami-Dade counties.[28]"

        "content": " The 1998 Pacific hurricane season was a fairly average Pacific hurricane season. Despite this, it had nine hurricanes and six major hurricanes, which was well above average. The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and ended on November 30; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in that region. The first tropical cyclone developed on June 11, about ten days later than the normal start of the season.[1] The final storm of the year, Hurricane Madeline, dissipated on October 20. Storm activity in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's warning zone was low, with just one tropical depression observed in the region. Two tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific (Darby and Estelle) also entered the central Pacific; the former did so as a hurricane. The most notable tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Isis, which killed fourteen people when it made landfall on southern Baja California Sur and coastal Sinaloa in Mexico. Isis caused considerable damage in the nation while destroying more than 700\u00a0homes and damaging dozens of cars.[2] It later produced sporadic rainfall in the southwestern United States, leading to some traffic accidents. In addition to Isis, Tropical Storm Javier moved ashore the coast of Jalisco in Mexico; the country also experienced indirect effects from four other storms, all of which remained offshore. One tropical cyclone, Hurricane Lester, affected Central America, causing two deaths in Guatemala, and later brought heavy rains to southern Mexico. Three tropical cyclones brought light to moderate rainfall to the southwestern United States, and one hurricane produced rough surf along the coast of California. Hurricane Madeline contributed to a deadly and costly flood in southern Texas."

        "content": "The season produced 13 named storms, slightly below the average of 15\u00a0named storms per season. However, the season total of nine hurricanes was one above the average, and the total of six major hurricanes surpassed the average of three.[3] Activity during the season was hindered by the northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The ITCZ, which is normally situated south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, shifted northward into Central and Southern Mexico, making the cyclone closer to cooler sea surface temperatures, hence limiting the number of storms that formed during the season. Although a semi-permanent anticyclone persisted through the summer of 1998, causing most of the storms to remain at sea, some storm did threaten the Baja California Peninsula due to a weakness in the anticyclone. Except for Hurricane Kay, all of the storms of the season originated from tropical waves.[4]\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of a storm multiplied by its duration, so longer-lived hurricanes have higher ACEs. The total ACE for the season was 133.97 \u00d7 104 kt2. Because several storms in 1998 were long-lasting or intense, the season's ACE was near-normal.[5] Hurricane Howard had the highest ACE, measuring 29.27 x 104 kt2."

        "content": "A poorly defined tropical wave crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 8. As it tracked westward under the influence of a ridge to its north, a broad circulation developed. Gradually, the dominant center of circulation became better defined, with increasingly organized convection and developing banding features.[1] By early on June 11, the center became sufficiently associated with the convection for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify the system as Tropical Depression One-E. This occurred while the area of unsettled weather was about 460 miles (740\u00a0km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico.[6] The center of the depression was not initially well defined, with restricted outflow in the eastern half of the circulation.[6] As such, the depression failed to attain any significant organization in the days subsequent to its formation. Later, an approaching tropical wave merged with the depression, resulting in a trend of intensification and increased organization. By June 13, the NHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, and gave it the name \"Agatha\". Agatha was about 650 miles (1,050\u00a0km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas when it became a tropical storm.[1] As Agatha became a tropical storm, forecasters predicted that it would not strengthen further, due to its forecast track passing over cooler waters.[7] However, Agatha quickly strengthened, developing a curved band of convection wrapping around its center,[8] and early on June 11 it attained a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) while about 615 miles (990\u00a0km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Agatha maintained peak winds for about 12\u00a0hours before moving over colder waters and gradually weakening. On June 15, it degenerated back into a tropical depression, and a day later, it dissipated over the open waters of the Pacific Ocean. The storm never affected land.[1]"

        "header": "Tropical Depression Two-E",
        "content": "A few days later, another westward-moving tropical disturbance paralleled the southern coast of Central America and Mexico. Convection in the area organized steadily, and late on June 19, the system developed into Tropical Depression Two-E about 260 miles (420\u00a0km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. On becoming a tropical depression, the system maintained a large, elongated, low-level circulation with some banding features and restricted outflow due to wind shear. The National Hurricane Center first predicted that the depression would intensify, reaching winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), though two computer models projected it to quickly dissipate. Under the influence of a ridge over Mexico, the depression moved to the west-northwest,[9] and, under the influence of increasing wind shear, the depression failed to organize significantly. By June 20, the circulation center was partially exposed, and was located to the northeast of the primary convection\u00a0\u2013 traits that signal a weak storm. Two-E approached tropical storm status,[10] though deep convection waned after the system moved over cooler waters. On June 21, the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the depression, stating that the depression maintained a very well-defined, low-level circulation, but had no convection associated with the system.[11] Locally heavy rains fell across southwest Mexico in association with this system, peaking at 5.55 inches (141\u00a0mm) at Las Gaviotas/Compostela.[12]"

The wave remained weak and nondescript as it crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 19. An area of convection developed and organized along the wave's axis, and the National Hurricane Center began to employ Dvorak classifications on June 20. Convective banding features increased as the broad circulation became better defined, and on June 22, the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Three-E about 575 miles (925\u00a0km) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Well-defined steering currents resulted in a general west-northwestward movement. Deep convection concentrated near the center, and about 12\u00a0hours after becoming a tropical depression, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Blas about 400 miles (640\u00a0km) south of Puerto Angel, Oaxaca.[13] Tropical Storm Blas continued to organize as it moved parallel to the Mexican coast. Banding features increased, and on June 23 the storm attained hurricane status about 345 miles (555\u00a0km) southwest of Acapulco. The next day, an eye developed and became apparent on satellite imagery, while upper-level outflow became better defined. Blas quickly strengthened and reached its peak intensity on June 25, with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h), while about 575 miles (925\u00a0km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. Temperatures warmed in the convection around the eye, though the eye remained visible for several days as Blas turned west under the influence of a ridge to its north. On June 28, it degenerated into a tropical storm after entering an area of cooler water. Blas weakened to a tropical depression on June 30, and a day later was considered to have dissipated due to a lack of convection near the center. A remnant low-level cloud swirl persisted for several days, passing well to the south of Hawaii on July 5 before dissipating. The Associated Press attributed 4\u00a0deaths from a mudslide in Michoac\u00e1n to Blas. However, as the primary convection remained offshore, the National Hurricane Center did not consider the deaths related to the hurricane.[13] The threat of Blas prompted officials in Acapulco to close the port to all navigation.[14]"

        "content": "On July 1, another tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa. It moved westward due to strong wind shear without further organization, and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 11. An area of organizing convection developed along the wave axis, and Dvorak classifications began on July 13, while the tropical wave was south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The cloud pattern soon became disorganized, and the area of disturbed weather continued west-northwestward. On July 16, convection increased and organized into banding features; early on July 17, the system developed into Tropical Depression Four-E about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Soon after becoming a tropical depression, the storm rapidly organized and intensified into Tropical Storm Celia six hours after becoming a tropical depression. The tropical storm initially moved northwestward, and briefly threatened southern Baja California. As a result, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning on July 18 for La Paz southward. Shortly thereafter, a mid- to upper-level anticyclone turned Celia to the west-northwest and forced it to pass about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. On July 19, Celia attained maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) before moving over cooler waters and diminishing in convection. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on July 20, and Celia dissipated early on July 21, well away from the Mexican coastline.[15] The precursor tropical disturbance produced locally heavy rainfall along the south coast of Mexico.[15] Authorities in Mexico closed the port at Acapulco to small fishing and recreational boats, and advised larger craft to use caution.[16] Damage from the storm, if any, is unknown."

        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 4. It tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean with little increase in convection, and crossed Central America into the Pacific Ocean on July 16. Three days later, convection began to increase along the wave axis while the wave was well to the south of Acapulco, Mexico. On July 21, Dvorak classifications began as the cloud pattern displayed curvature on satellite images. Convective banding features gradually developed, and it is estimated that the system organized into Tropical Depression Five-E early on July 23 about 720 miles (1,160\u00a0km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. Under the influence of a mid- to upper-level ridge to its north, the depression tracked west-northwestward. Convection became more concentrated as outflow organized further, and 18\u00a0hours after the depression first developed, it intensified into Tropical Storm Darby.[17] Located in an area conducive to further development, Darby attained hurricane status on July 24, subsequent to the development of a 17-mile (27\u00a0km)-wide eye.[17] The eye became more distinct while surrounded by an area of deep convection, and on July 25 the hurricane reached peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) about 850 miles (1,370\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas.[18] The eye soon disappeared on satellite imagery, believed to be from an eyewall replacement cycle, and Darby's winds weakened to about 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h). A 25-mile (40\u00a0km) eye next developed, and on July 26, the hurricane re-intensified to reach peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h).[17] For a 30-hour period, Darby attained the characteristics of an annular hurricane, retaining a well-defined structure with few banding features for an extended period.[19] The hurricane began to weaken while entering an area of cooler water and increased wind shear, and after crossing into the jurisdiction of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, Darby weakened to a tropical storm on July 29. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on July 31, and early on August 1, Darby dissipated a moderate distance north of the Hawaiian Islands. It never affected land.[17]"

The wave moved across the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico before crossing Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 28. Early on July 29, Dvorak classifications began on the system, and subsequent to the formation of banding features and a surface circulation, the system developed into Tropical Depression Six-E about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. The depression continued to organize, with increasing convection and distinct upper-level outflow, and early on July 30 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Estelle.[20] Tropical Storm Estelle gradually intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, a motion caused by a large anticyclone to its north. On July 31, the storm attained hurricane status about 550 miles (890\u00a0km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. Its intensification continued as a well-defined eye about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) in diameter became visible on satellite imagery, and on August 2 Estelle reached its peak intensity of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h). The hurricane soon began to weaken as deep convection diminished and the eye disappeared on satellite imagery. Two days after peaking in intensity, Estelle weakened to tropical storm status. Late on August 4, the convection associated with the storm dissipated, and the next day the storm weakened to tropical depression status. Convection briefly re-developed on August 6, though increased wind shear and cooler water weakened the depression further. Two days later, Estelle dissipated about 400 miles (640\u00a0km) east-northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.[20] High surf from Estelle impacted southern California, resulting in a number of lifeguard rescues.[21] The storm disrupted the trade winds around Hawaii, resulting in light winds and rain showers on Kauai and Oahu.[22]"

A mid-level circulation developed to the south of Cape Verde on July 22, though the wave became less distinct as it continued westward. The wave axis crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 31. Convection steadily increased, though it was not until August 4 that the convection began to organize. Dvorak classifications began on August 4, and subsequent to the formation of a low-level circulation the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6 about 550 miles (890\u00a0km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression tracked generally northward, under the influence of a ridge over Mexico and a mid-level trough to its west.[23] The center of the depression was initially elongated, with northerly wind shear impacting the structure of the cyclone.[24] This at first prevented further strengthening,[23] though convection increased and organized into banding features as it moved through an area of warm water.[25] On August 8, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Frank, and it soon turned to the north-northwest, brushing the western coastline of Baja California. On August 9, Frank reached peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) about 105 miles (169\u00a0km) west-northwest of Ciudad Constituci\u00f3n. It turned to the northwest, with a portion of the circulation of the land, and steadily weakened after moving over cooler water. On August 10, Frank dissipated a short distance off Baja California.[23] On August 8, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for portions of the southwestern Baja California Peninsula.[23] Officials ordered the evacuation of some residents near Cabo San Lucas, whose port was closed, due to the threat of mudslides.[26] Gusty winds and moderate rainfall were reported in a localized area of Baja California Sur,[23] with rainfall peaking at 9.61 inches (244\u00a0mm) at Santa Anita, near Los Cabos.[27] Moisture from Frank extended into the southwestern United States,[23] producing more than 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) of rain in southern California and Arizona.[28] One news agency attributed three deaths to the storm,[29] though elsewhere there were no reports of damage.[23]"

It tracked westward, and by August 9 a low-level circulation formed well to the south of Mexico. Banding features increased as the system detached from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and on August 11, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight-E about 730 miles (1,170\u00a0km) southwest of Acapulco.[30] On becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained an area of concentrated deep convection near the center. The National Hurricane Center initially predicted that the depression would slowly intensify and reach winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) within 72\u00a0hours. For much of the rest of the storm's duration, the National Hurricane Center underestimated the intensity of the cyclone.[31] The depression tracked steadily northwestward, caused by its location along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge. It would retain that direction for most of its remaining duration. Late on August 11, it intensified into Tropical Storm Georgette, and two days later it attained hurricane status after developing a 40-mile (64\u00a0km) eye about 615 miles (990\u00a0km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.[30] The eye became increasingly distinct while banding features became very well organized.[32] Georgette attained peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) while centered 690 miles (1,110\u00a0km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California.[30] The hurricane soon moved over cooler water,[32] and began to weaken as convection warmed and decreased.

On reaching the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 17, however, an area of convection developed along the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began the next day, and a broad center of circulation gradually formed. Convection was intermittent at first, though it gradually organized and persisted near the center, and on August 20, the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Nine-E about 345 miles (555\u00a0km) south of Puerto Angel, Mexico. It tracked generally west-northwestward, developing more pronounced banding features, and on August 21, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Howard. The center of Howard became embedded within the deep convection, and the storm quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status late on the 21st. An eye developed as outflow organized further, and Howard began to rapidly intensify to reach peak winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) about 600 miles (970\u00a0km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. At the time of its peak intensity, the eye was small and located within a very cold central dense overcast.[33] Shortly after peaking in intensity, the eye of Hurricane Howard gradually became larger, resulting in a slight weakening trend. After weakening to winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h),[33] the eye reached a diameter of about 30 miles (48\u00a0km), and the structure of the hurricane transitioned into that of an annular hurricane, similar to that of Darby earlier in the season.[19] Howard strengthened again into a Category 4 hurricane on August 25 before weakening slightly the following day.[33] The hurricane retained annular characteristics for about 48\u00a0hours before moving over cooler water.[19] On August 28, it weakened to a tropical storm, and early on August 30, Howard was considered to have dissipated.

A convective disturbance along the northern portion of the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Danielle on August 24, while the southern portion of the wave axis continued westward. The wave remained inactive and difficult to track as it crossed the Atlantic. On September 3, an area of convection began to develop near Acapulco, at the same time and location where the wave would have been based on extrapolation. The disturbance became better defined on September 5 as it tracked west-northwestward, and on September 6 the convection became sufficiently organized and persistent for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Eleven-E, while it was located about 200 miles (320\u00a0km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.[38] Easterly wind shear initially dislocated the circulation center to the eastern edge of the convection. The subtropical ridge to its north resulted in a general west-northwest motion,[39] and the depression slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Javier late on September 7. Banding features in the system did not organize significantly, and on September 8, Javier attained a peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), which coincided with a sharp increase in convection over the center. Steering currents soon weakened, and the storm turned to the east while convection quickly decreased. By September 9, the center was exposed from the diminishing deep convection, and that night it degenerated into a tropical depression. On September 11, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on Javier, though later analysis indicates that it remained a tropical cyclone as it turned southeastward. At times, it became difficult to distinguish Javier from the broader area of disturbed weather that persisted over the tropical eastern Pacific, though a brief increase in convection and a ship report of winds exceeding 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) indicate that Javier strengthened again into a tropical storm late on September 12. It turned to the northeast, and reached winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) before weakening due to waning convection. Javier made landfall about 35 miles (56\u00a0km) east-southeast of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco early on September 14, and dissipated within 12\u00a0hours of moving ashore.[38] The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along coastal areas of Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm. Javier produced moderate rainfall along coastal regions of Mexico, including a 24-hour peak of 7.36 inches (187\u00a0mm) in Colima, 6.69 inches (170\u00a0mm) in Michoac\u00e1n, and 3.34 inches (85\u00a0mm) in Jalisco. Puerto Vallarta reported the highest total rainfall, at 17.33 inches (440\u00a0mm).[40] Damage, if any, is unknown.[41]"

Within an environment of weak steering currents, the depression was initially forecast to track slowly west-northwestward and reach winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), but instead it drifted eastward before turning slowly to the west.[42][43] The depression failed to organize and gradually worsened in appearance. Early on October 2, two ships reported southwest winds much further to the north, with the National Hurricane Center indicating that either the center was exceedingly small, that no center existed at the time, or that the center was located far to the north of the thunderstorm activity. Operationally, the center was relocated further to the north,[44] then relocated about 115 miles (185\u00a0km) to the south six hours later based on visible satellite images,[45] then again relocated to the north, coinciding with officials issuing the last advisory on the system. By early October 3, the depression possessed only intermittent convection,[46] and later that day it dissipated to the southwest of the Baja California peninsula.[43] Heavy rains from its eastern periphery fell across southwest Mexico, with a maximum total of 6.34 inches (161\u00a0mm) at Las Gaviotas/Compostela.[47]"

The circulation was well defined, though its convection was initially minimal and disorganized. On October 12, the convection increased greatly, and the system was sufficiently organized to be classified Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on October 13, about 715 miles (1,151\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Dvorak classifications also indicated winds of about 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h). Operationally, the depression was forecast to intensify to reach peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) while tracking steadily west-northwestward.[48] The storm center was at first ill-defined,[49] and post-season analysis estimates that it intensified into Tropical Storm Kay about 6\u00a0hours after developing. After becoming a tropical storm, Kay rapidly organized as it tracked generally westward. A pinhole eye developed in the center of the convection, and Kay attained hurricane status late on October 13, about 18\u00a0hours after developing. After remaining a hurricane for about 12\u00a0hours, the eye disappeared and the convection weakened, and early on October 14 Kay degenerated into a tropical storm. Within an environment of weak steering currents, the storm turned to the southwest, then to the south, after weakening to a tropical depression on October 15. Convection sporadically redeveloped, but failed to persist. Kay turned to the southeast and later to the east, and the system dissipated on October 17, about 330 miles (530\u00a0km) south-southwest of its origin. Kay never affected land.[50]"

The wave axis continued westward, and after crossing Central America convection increased as it tracked northwestward, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 15, about 200 miles (320\u00a0km) south of Guatemala. It moved northwestward and late on the 15th it intensified into Tropical Storm Lester, about 115 miles (185\u00a0km)/h) south of the border of Mexico and Guatemala, before attaining hurricane status on October 16. Lester continued westward and strengthened to reach a peak intensity of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) on October 22. Late on October 23, it degenerated into a tropical storm, and several days later, Lester dissipated on October 26.[51] Early in its lifetime, Lester produced heavy rainfall across southwestern Guatemala. The rainfall destroyed some houses and killed livestock, and a mudslide from the heavy precipitation killed two children.[52] In Honduras, rainfall from the hurricane destroyed a bridge in Tegucigalpa, affecting about 1,000\u00a0people.[53] Moisture brought around the northeast periphery of the Sierra Madre Occidental led to a narrow band of heavy rainfall along the upslope side of the mountain range, with a local precipitation maximum exceeding 14 inches (360\u00a0mm).[54] Though no surface reports are available, it is estimated that tropical-storm-force winds occurred along coastal areas of southern Mexico.[51]"

The final tropical cyclone of the 1998 Pacific hurricane season, Madeline originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on September 25, 1998. The wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean and crossed over Central America on October 5 or 6.

The wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea before crossing Central America on October 5 or October 6. After several days, convection increased, and Dvorak classifications initiated. Satellite imagery indicated that the system dissipated on October 11, although an area of cloudiness persisted off the coast of Mexico. After four days, the system regenerated and under diffluent flow aloft, deep convection became more concentrated;[1] it is estimated that a tropical depression formed at 0000\u00a0UTC on October 16, about 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.[2] Initially, due to disorganization, determining the forward movement of depression was difficult,[3] although a few hours later it was estimated that the system was tracking to the north-northwest.[4] With favorable conditions aloft, the deep convection became more concentrated, and 12\u00a0hours after first developing, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Madeline about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes.[2] During the afternoon, convective cloud tops warmed slightly although the storm continued to intensify.[5] Soon after, thunderstorm activity became limited as Madeline remained generally stationary in movement.[6] An approaching mid-level trough turned Madeline to the northeast. Banding features gradually improved in organization, and late on October 17 the storm attained hurricane status.[2] However, satellite imagery indicated that convective activity was confined to the western portion of the storm, and at the same time an eye began to form.[7] Early on October 18, data from a Reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm found a minimum central pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg), as the storm was drifting to the northeast at around 4\u00a0mph (6.4\u00a0km/h) near the western edge of a large-scale east\u2013west ridge axis.[8] The apparent eye became cloud-filled shortly thereafter, and a slight increase in temperature was discovered near the center. Despite this, upper-level outflow was favorable, leading to predictions of slight intensification.[9] Shortly thereafter, Madeline attained peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) about 95 miles (153\u00a0km) southwest of San Blas, Nayarit. The hurricane maintained peak winds for about 18\u00a0hours while curving again to the northwest.[2] With evidence of southern wind shear, only a small area of deep thunderstorm activity existed on October 19, and the system began to appear ill-defined of satellite imagery.[10] The hurricane quickly weakened into a tropical storm,[2] and by later that day, the storm became void of convection due to strong wind shear.[11] On October 19, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression, leaving just a swirl of low clouds midway between the southern tip of Baja California and mainland Mexico.[2] By 0600\u00a0UTC on October 20, the remnants of Madeline had completely dissipated.[2]"

The storm was initially forecast to move ashore near Mazatl\u00e1n, prompting officials to close the city's port. President Ernesto Zedillo advised potentially affected residents to stay indoors or seek refuge in shelters.[12] Also, the threat of the hurricane canceled a fishing expedition in the Gulf of California due to rough surf. The expedition was to provide a new aquarium in downtown Denver, Colorado with about 8,500\u00a0fish.[13] Mexican authorities deployed 2,000\u00a0soldiers in remote areas of the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa to prepare for the hurricane. Several thousand residents and tourists at the resorts of Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan were put on standby to evacuate their homes.[14] Authorities along the coast in the state of Nayarit went house to house, advising people about the oncoming storm.[15] In addition, ships from Salina Cruz to Acapulco were advised to stay in port.[16] Although Madeline never crossed the coast, numerous rainbands affected the Mexican coast, dropping up to 9.8\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm).[31] Despite this, no damage or fatalities were reported in Mexico.[2] After the storm had dissipated, the remnant plume of moisture contributed to severe flooding in central Texas.[32] Rainfall in Texas reached 22 inches (560\u00a0mm) in some locations. Thirty-one people died due to the flooding, and damage totaled to $750\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD).[33] A total of 24 of the deaths were drownings, 22 of them were caused by driving vehicles into high water on a road flooded by the torrential downpours. There were 16 different incidents when these types of deaths occurred, four of them involving in multiple deaths. Three others died due to trauma, and one died from hypothermia after the person was submerged in the water.[34] The greatest impact was in Southern Texas, which included the urban areas of San Antonio and Austin, and all of their surrounding suburbs. The counties with the most significant rainfall, damage, and fatalities were Travis County, Bexar County, Guadalupe County, Comal County, and Caldwell County. This area included both the cities of San Antonio and Austin. In a small area in Caldwell County, there was 29 inches (740\u00a0mm) of rain estimated by the United States Geological Survey. This included the area of Lockhart, Texas, which was badly flooded by the storm due to its close proximity to the San Marcos River. Most of the county picked up an estimated 20 to 30\u00a0in (510 to 760\u00a0mm) of rain, including San Marcos, Texas, New Braunfels, Texas, and Kyle, Texas.[35] In all, portions of 60 counties in Texas were flooded and hundreds of people were forced to flee their homes.[36] Due to the flooding, twenty counties were declared federal disaster areas, clearing the way for assistance such as federal loans. Then-president Bill Clinton promised aid to the victims of the storm and then-governor George W. Bush took a tour of the devastated region with the Federal Emergency Management Agency director.[37]"

        "content": "Hurricane Hortense was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in Guadeloupe and Puerto Rico since Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and the second most intense hurricane during the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. The eighth tropical cyclone, eighth named storm, and sixth hurricane of the season, Hortense developed on September\u00a03 from a tropical wave in the central Atlantic Ocean. Initially a tropical depression, it headed westward without significant strengthening for four days due to unfavorable upper-level winds. While nearing the Lesser Antilles upper-level winds decreased, allowing the depression to become Tropical Storm Hortense on September\u00a07. Hortense crossed Guadeloupe on September\u00a08 and entered the Caribbean Sea. By on the following day, it was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward. Hortense made landfall in Puerto Rico on September\u00a09 and brushed the Dominican Republic shortly thereafter. After re-entering the Atlantic, Hortense began to substantially strengthen and peaked as a 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a04 hurricane early on September\u00a013. Thereafter, the storm steadily weakened as it tracked rapidly north-northeastward. Early on September\u00a015, Hortense made landfall in Nova Scotia as a minimal Category\u00a01 hurricane. It quickly weakened further to a tropical storm before re-entering the Atlantic to the south of Newfoundland. Late on September\u00a015, Hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and subsequently merged with a frontal system about 24\u00a0hours later. The storm produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed through the Lesser Antilles. On Guadeloupe, damage was most significant to crops, with over 50% of banana plantains destroyed. Localized flooding was reported on Martinique. Impact was most significant in Puerto Rico. Across the island, 11,463\u00a0houses were severely damaged. About 1.4\u00a0million people on Puerto Rico were left without electricity \u2013 equivalent to about 40% of the island's population. Damage in Puerto Rico was estimated at $153.4\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD). There were also 19\u00a0deaths, most of which due to drowning during flash floods. In the Dominican Republic, strong winds damaged a number of buildings and houses, and downed several power lines. Flooding also forced the closure of several roads and impacted 80% of crops in Saman\u00e1 Province. At least three fatalities were confirmed in that country. The storm brought strong winds to the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and lesser winds to Bermuda. Later in its duration, Hortense struck Nova Scotia, bringing heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds to isolated locations. There were many power outages, trees blown down, roofs torn away, and roads damaged in the Province. New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island were also impacted, though not as severely as in Nova Scotia. Damage in Atlantic Canada reached approximately $3.64\u00a0million."

The low-pressure area, which had deepened to 1,005\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg) by August\u00a031, moved south of Cape Verde. Although deep convection was minimal on satellite imagery, the system possessed a well-defined low- to mid-level circulation. After crossing several National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration buoys early on September\u00a03, it was determined that the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight at 1200\u00a0UTC on that same day, while located about halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. Under the influence of strong high pressure ridge, the depression tracked almost due westward, without significant intensification. Convection remained sporadic and disorganized, with a reconnaissance flight finding a board circulation and a few squall on September\u00a06. While nearing the Leeward Islands, upper-level winds reduced to a favorable level, causing strengthening and allowing deep convection to increase.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, the depression had intensified into Tropical Storm Hortense. A reconnaissance flight around that time reported winds of 71\u00a0mph (114\u00a0km/h), confirming the storm was strengthening. Early on September\u00a08, Hortense struck Guadeloupe with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). Shortly thereafter, intensification slowed, due to increased vertical wind shear by upper-level short wave in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Convection diminished, with satellite imagery showing a tropical cyclone with the low-level circulation exposed. The short-wave soon left the area, causing wind shear to decrease and convection quickly re-developed. By early on September\u00a09, Hortense was upgraded to a hurricane, while curving northwestward. Around 0600\u00a0UTC on the following day, the storm made landfall near Gu\u00e1nica, Puerto Rico with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h);[1] this made it the first hurricane landfall on the island since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Initially, most tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated Hortense would pass south of the island and instead strike the Dominican Republic.[2] After two hours, Hortense emerged into the Mona Passage and brushed the eastern tip of Dominican Republic; Punta Cana near the eastern tip of the country reported the calm of the eye on September\u00a010. Land interaction with Hispaniola weakened the storm slightly, though it would soon re-strengthen.[1] While tracking east of Turks and Caicos Islands on September\u00a011, Hortense became a Category\u00a02 hurricane and then to a Category\u00a03 hurricane by early on the following day. Continuing to intensify, Hortense reached Category\u00a04 intensity on September\u00a012. Around that time, a developing trough centered over the Eastern United States caused the storm to curve almost due northward and accelerate. At 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, Hortense attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg). After maintaining Category\u00a04 intensity for 24\u00a0hours, the storm weakened back to a Category\u00a03 hurricane. While passing well west of Bermuda, Hortense was downgraded to a Category\u00a02 hurricane early on September\u00a014. Later that day, the storm weakened further to a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Early on September\u00a015, Hortense made its final landfall near West Quoddy, Nova Scotia with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h). Hortense weakened over Nova Scotia and was a tropical storm when it re-emerged into the Atlantic less than nine hours after landfall. By 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, Hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while just south of Newfoundland. The storm's remnants merged with a frontal system on the following day.[1]"

A station on Guadeloupe reported a total of 12.5\u00a0in (320\u00a0mm). La D\u00e9sirade observed 81\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) wind gusts and sustained winds of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) while Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre International Airport observed 58\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) wind gusts.[1][9] The storm caused significant crop damage, destroying roughly over 50 percent of the banana plantain.[10][11] Further south, heavy rains led to scattered flooding in Martinique,[12] which inundated streets, while strong winds knocked down power lines.[13] One man who attempted to drive across a flooded road was rescued from his vehicle seconds before it was swept away.[14] While Hortense passed south of Saint Croix, the storm produced sustained winds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) at Henry E. Rohlsen Airport, with unofficial gusts to 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[15] Hortense dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 18.0\u00a0in (460\u00a0mm) in Christiansted.[16] The rains flooded low-lying areas of Frederiksted. On nearby Saint Thomas, the storm dropped 7.0\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rainfall, with gusts reaching only 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h).[15]"

Totals ranged from below 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) near where the storm moved ashore to a peak of 23.5\u00a0in (600\u00a0mm) near Cayey.[16] Three stations broke their 12\u2013hour rainfall records and two stations broke their 24\u2013hour rainfall records; the highest 24\u2013hour total was 19.5\u00a0in (500\u00a0mm) in Las Piedras. The rainfall caused widespread flash flooding and increased river discharge; a station along the R\u00edo Grande de Lo\u00edza in San Lorenzo reported a 1 in 100 year flow rate. Rivers and creeks across the region reached high peaks,[15] and there were several reports of mudslides.[1] Sustained winds on the island peaked at 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) in Ceiba, and gusts reached 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) in Carolina.[15] An unofficial wind gust of 109\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h) in the southwest portion of the island may have been caused by the Venturi effect, or an acceleration of winds between walls.[1] Along the southern Puerto Rico coast, Hortense caused coastal flooding and beach erosion.[15] An overflown river near San Juan flooded several homes. Across the island, Hortense left about 1.3\u00a0million people without power and 1.1\u00a0million customers without water. During the storm, 10,563\u00a0people evacuated to storm shelters.[15] Across the island, 11,463\u00a0houses were severely damaged by Hortense.[1] The hurricane left $128.4\u00a0million in crop damage, primarily to coffee, plantains, and bananas. There was another $25\u00a0million from road damage. There were 19\u00a0deaths on the island, many of whom due to flash flood drownings.[15] Some 1,400,000\u00a0people, about 40% of the population, lost power during and after the storm, straining the cleanup effort in the following days and weeks with lack of air conditioning and spoiled food.[17] While Hortense was near the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana reported sustained winds of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h), which was the highest land wind report associated with the hurricane. Puerto Plata along the northern coast also reported hurricane-force winds. High winds destroyed a school and church, damaged several houses, and downed several power lines. Like its effects in Puerto Rico, Hortense dropped heavy rainfall in the Dominican Republic, peaking at 19.25\u00a0in (489\u00a0mm) in San Rafael del Yuma. While passing the region, the hurricane produced a 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) storm surge. The combination of the surge and heavy rainfall produced flooding that closed roadways. Hortense damaged 80% of the crops in Saman\u00e1. In the country, the hurricane killed three people and left 21\u00a0missing.[1]"

The storm also brought rainfall to the island, though total amounts are unknown.[18][19] In Nova Scotia, Hortense dropped heavy rainfall and caused strong winds, causing power outages, uprooted trees, and moderate structural damage amounting to $3\u00a0million (1996 USD).[20] Rainfall was light on Prince Edward Island, with the highest observed being 1.7 inches (43\u00a0mm) in Charlottetown. Strong winds were reported throughout the province. Gusts reached 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) in Charlottetown and 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) elsewhere. The winds downed power lines, leaving numerous residents without electricity, especially in Charlottetown, East Point, Montague, Murray River, Souris. Effects were almost nil in New Brunswick, limited to rainfall peaking at 2.1 inches (53\u00a0mm), though most of it was a storm system that preceded Hortense's passage. Sustained winds in the province were light, reaching about 27\u00a0mph (43\u00a0km/h)."

        "content": "Settlement of this portion of the Colony of Virginia by Europeans began around 1745. Located west of the Tidewater and Piedmont regions in Virginia and also west of the Shenandoah Valley, this area is beyond (known in old Virginia as the \"Transmountaine\") the Blue Ridge Mountains. Rather than cross such a formidable physical barrier, most early settlers came southerly up the Valley across the Potomac River from Maryland and Pennsylvania.\nMany followed the Great Wagon Road, also known as the Valley Pike (U.S. Route 11 in modern times). As German immigrants began to push over the mountains to the northern area of the present county, those of Scots-Irish descent settled in the southern part. Even after Virginia and the other 12 colonies won their independence from Great Britain after the American Revolutionary War, the area remained sparsely populated. In the 1840s, the historic Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike was built through the area. Engineered by Claudius Crozet through the mountainous terrain, it was a toll road partially funded by the Virginia Board of Public Works. The turnpike formed an important link between the upper Shenandoah Valley with the Ohio River.[3] Highland County was formed in 1847 from Bath County and Pendleton County after a bill was passed by the Virginia General Assembly on March 19 of that year.[4]  The desire for the new county's formation arose due to multiple reasons, including the distances from the areas in present-day Highland to the county seats of Bath and Pendleton and the advantageous position of the new turnpike.[5]  Highland was named for its lofty elevation.[6] Control of the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike became crucial during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865). By all accounts, documented in many letters home from young troops, a miserable winter in 1861 was spent by Union and Confederate troops holding opposing high elevation positions along the road. The Battle of McDowell, the first Confederate victory of Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley campaign, took place at McDowell on May 8, 1862.[3] In the 20th century, the Turnpike was re-designated as U.S. Route 250. In the 21st century, it remains Highland County's major east\u2013west roadway, and crossing into West Virginia, becomes a National Scenic Byway.[3]"

        "header": "Geography",
        "content": "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Highland County has a total area of 415.9 square miles (1,077.2\u00a0km2), of which 415.2 square miles (1,075.4\u00a0km2) is land and 0.7 square miles (1.8\u00a0km2) (0.2%) is water.[7] The county's western border is naturally defined and lies along the Eastern Continental Divide in the Allegheny Mountains. Likewise, the eastern border lies along the ridge line of Shenandoah Mountain. The northern and southern boundaries of the county are defined more artificially, cutting across numerous mountain ridges and valleys.[8][9][10]  The county is bordered to the west by Pocahontas County in the state of West Virginia, to the north by Pendleton County, West Virginia, to the east by Augusta County, Virginia, and to the south by Bath County, Virginia.[10][11]  The county is 153 miles (246\u00a0km) northwest of Richmond, Virginia.[11] The average elevation of Highland County is 2,832 feet (863\u00a0m), which is the 16th highest average elevation among counties in the Eastern United States.[12]  The highest elevation in the county is 4,545 feet (1,385\u00a0m) in the Allegheny Mountains and the lowest elevation is 1,625 feet (495\u00a0m) near the Cowpasture River southwest of Patna.[10][13]  The western regions of the county are generally higher in elevation than are the eastern and especially southeastern regions.[14]  As the county lies within the Ridge-and-Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains, it features numerous valleys and mountain ridges that are generally oriented in a \"northeast to southwest\" direction.[13]  The valleys are from west to east the Alleghany Valley, the Bluegrass Valley, the Monterey Valley, the Bullpasture Valley, and the Cowpasture Valley.[9][15]  The majority of the county and all the southern portions of the county form part of the James River watershed, while northern sections drain into the Potomac River. West of Monterey, the divide is roughly centered along the path of U.S. Route 250; however, in eastern Highland County, the James watershed extends further northward.[13][16] The westernmost valley, the Alleghany Valley, is narrow and situated between Allegheny Mountain to the west and Lantz Mountain to the east. It is drained by Back Creek, a tributary of the Jackson River, in the southern section of the county and is drained by Straight Fork to the north. The Laurel Fork runs to the west of Alleghany Valley, joining the Straight Fork in Pendleton County, West Virginia to the north to form the North Fork South Branch Potomac River. The Bluegrass Valley contains the headwaters of the Jackson River south of U.S. 250 and the South Branch Potomac River to the north. The northern section of the valley, in the area of the village of Blue Grass, is considerably wider than the southern section of the valley. The Jackson River flows out of Bluegrass Valley to the east through Vanderpool Gap approximately 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) south of Hightown. A short distance south, the Bluegrass Valley is drained by the Back Creek. Monterey Valley is located roughly in the center of the county, and its drainage is separated at Monterey. To the north of Monterey, the valley is drained by the Strait Creek and South Branch Potomac River; to the south, the valley is drained by the Jackson River. The Bullpasture Valley is drained throughout the county to the south by the Bullpasture River. The Cowpasture Valley, the easternmost valley in the county, is mostly drained to the south by the Cowpasture River, although a small portion to the north is drained by the South Fork South Branch Potomac River.[8][10][17]"

These locations include the Jack Mountain tract southwest of McDowell, the Bullpasture Mountain tract south of McDowell in the southeastern corner of the county, and the Little Doe Hill tract west of McDowell.[19][20]  The national forest and Highland Wildlife Management Area combined account for 71,455 acres (289.17\u00a0km2) of Highland County's land, or approximately 28% of the county's total land area.[21] All of Highland County is located within the United States National Radio Quiet Zone, a 13,000-square-mile (34,000\u00a0km2) area of limited radio activity.

In addition, the region features consistent rainfall year-round and lacks a dry season.[26]  Monterey, the county seat, is representative of the average climate of Highland, as it is situated at roughly the mean elevation for the county.[27]  Locations in the county's higher elevations experience cooler temperatures whereas locations in lower elevations experience warmer and milder temperatures.[27]  The lowest temperature on record in Monterey occurred in January 1985 at \u221226\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221232.2\u00a0\u00b0C) and the highest recorded temperature occurred in July 1952 at 95\u00a0\u00b0F (35\u00a0\u00b0C).[24]  The winter season is long in Highland, though less severely cold than other locations.[28]  The average annual temperature for the county is 47.6\u00a0\u00b0F (8.7\u00a0\u00b0C).[29]  From 1948 to 1990, the average annual precipitation was 40.96 inches or 1,040.4 millimetres and the average annual snowfall was 34.40 inches or 0.87 metres.[30] Tornadoes in Highland County are very rare, with only one tornado on record in the county with the National Weather Service.[31][32]  This tornado occurred on April 28, 1959, at approximately 3:00 PM near Mustoe.[33][34]  The tornado's classification on the Fujita scale is reported by the National Weather Service in its database to be unknown,[33] though another document records it as an F1.[31]  The exact path of the tornado is uncertain, however, no damage or injuries were reported.[31]  Another possible, but unconfirmed, tornado touchdown may have occurred on April 4, 1974, during the 1974 Super Outbreak. A barn and chicken house were damaged during this storm and a building was lifted off its foundation in the Big Valley area.[32] Since 1955, Highland County has experienced twenty instances of severe hail, which is defined by the National Weather Service as hailstones having a diameter of at least 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm). If the old definition of at least 3\u20444 inch (1.9\u00a0cm) diameter hailstones is considered, the county has experienced twenty-two instances of severe hail during the same period.[35] Highland County has significant wind resources, attaining an average annual wind power class of 5 in some regions.[13][36]  Class 5 wind power is considered excellent for generating electricity via wind power, with average annual wind speeds between 16.8 and 17.9 miles per hour (27.0 and 28.8\u00a0km/h).[37]  Between 1955 and 2012, there have been twenty-one instances of damaging wind in the county on record with the National Weather Service. Of the nine instances which have estimated wind speeds, the average maximum gust speed was 52.8 miles per hour (85.0\u00a0km/h).[38]"

Cattle grazing is especially suited for the area as the mountainous terrain leaves only a small fraction of the total land suitable for cultivation.[40]  Agricultural purposes use approximately 36% of the county's land.[41]  In 2012, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting accounted for 7.8% of the jobs in the county.[42]  According to 2007 census data, there were 239 farms, 76,764 acres (310.65\u00a0km2) of farmland, and 8,581 acres (34.73\u00a0km2) of harvested cropland in the county.  Wool production is a significant industry in the county,[42] which was ranked fifth in Virginia in 2010 for the largest number of lamb and sheep with approximately 4,500 head. Highland County in 2010 had approximately 8,000 head of cattle, 53rd in the state, and produced 15,700 tons of hay in 2009, also ranked 53rd in the state.[43]  The county has 211,300 acres (855\u00a0km2) of timberland, of which the majority is on private lands.[44]  Between 1986 and 2001, the average annual average harvest value of timber in the county was $1,248,889, ranked 54th in the state.[45] The largest employment sector in the county in 2012 was government, accounting for 34.1% of jobs. Among government jobs, local government jobs represented the majority, with 25.7% of jobs in all sectors. The finance and insurance sector accounted for 9.6% of all jobs, and health care and social assistance accounted for 8.2%. Construction held 7.2% of jobs, followed by retail trade with 6.8%. The remainder of jobs were distributed among various other sectors.[42]  The largest employers were Allen Lowry Logging and Highland County Public Schools.[46] Highland County is located in the Appalachian region as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC).[47]  The county as of 2014[update] is considered to have a \"transitional\" economy by the ARC, meaning it ranks \"between the worst 25 percent and the best 25 percent\" of counties and it is in a transitional period between weak and strong economies.[48]"

The route then reaches the village of Hightown where it intersects Virginia State Route 640.[10][53]  Hightown marks the division between the watersheds of the James and Potomac Rivers, for the headwaters of the Jackson River, a tributary of the James, and the South Branch Potomac River are located near the village.[54]  After leaving Hightown, U.S. 250 ascends Monterey Mountain before descending to the county's seat of Monterey. In Monterey, U.S. 250, the county's major east\u2013west route, intersects the county's major north\u2013south route, U.S. 220. Continuing eastward, U.S. 250 follows the flow of Crab Run through mountainous terrain towards McDowell.

In the 1870s, there were prospects of a railroad named the Washington, Cincinnati, and St. Louis Railroad entering the county. This line was proposed as a narrow gauge railroad to be built from Harrisonburg, Virginia to Monterey and then westward into West Virginia, eventually reaching western markets. The railroad, which has been described as being \"so poorly conceived that its failure was inevitable\", was never built.[59]  Another potential railroad to enter Highland County was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly on February 29, 1892, as the Augusta, Highland, and Alleghany Railroad. This railroad was to connect with either the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway or Valley Railroad in Augusta County and build a line towards Monterey.[60][61] The Augusta, Highland, and Alleghany Railroad appears to have never been organized or built, as documents from 1911 and 1922 state that no railroad existed in the county.[62][63]  The prospects of a railroad reaching Highland were limited due to the mountainous terrain and a general lack of sufficient traffic to make such an investment economically viable.[63]"

It was not until 1820 that education became publicly supported, having been left to private hands previously. Though the system established in 1820 was of a rudimentary quality, books sufficient for teaching the three Rs were provided by public funds. Additional subjects were studied, such as geography and grammar, as resources were available.[70]  The first tax levied in support of the public schools was passed in 1847[71] and the county was divided into twelve school districts in 1850.[70]  Numerous small schools were distributed throughout the county, and by 1893, there was a total of 47 schools.[72]   By the early 1900s, the county was divided into three school districts: Blue Grass, Monterey, and Stonewall. In 1922, the county's school districts were consolidated into one district and there were \"52 one- and two-room grammar schools\" and \"three accredited four-year high schools\". By 1929, the total number of schools decreased to 32 as the school district became more consolidated. In 1957, all high schools in the county were consolidated and all high school students were located at the Monterey High School. High school students were again transferred in 1963 to the current high school building, and by 1985, all elementary students were transferred to Monterey Elementary School, housed in the building previously used as the Monterey High School. In 1997, the elementary school was transferred to the complex of the high school, forming the present day status of the school district.[73] There are no colleges or universities located in Highland County. There are several colleges and universities, however, within the neighboring counties and surrounding area. These include Blue Ridge Community College, James Madison University, Washington and Lee University, and the University of Virginia, among others. These institutions are generally within a two-hour drive from Highland County.[66]"

The Board of Supervisors also appoints a county administrator who handles the implementation of county policies and ordinances. In addition to the Board of Supervisors, other elected members of the county government include the \"County Treasurer, the Commissioner of Revenue, the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the Commonwealth Attorney, and the County Sheriff.\"  Monterey, the county seat, is an incorporated town and thus has its own government officials consisting of a town council and a mayor.[92] Highland County levies a 1% sales tax, a 1.5% personal property tax, a 1% machinery and tools tax, and a .37% real estate tax.[64][94]  46% of the county's total revenue in 2010 was derived from local taxes, of which 76% was accounted for in property tax levies. The remaining 54% of the county's revenue was from state and federal sources.[92] Highland County has historically been one of the most consistently reliable strongholds for the Republican Party in national elections, voting for the Republican candidate for U.S. President in every election since 1936.[95][96]  Also, since the 1989 Virginia Gubernatorial Election, the county has voted for the Republican candidate.[97]  Currently, Highland County is located in Virginia's 6th congressional district[98] which is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Republican Ben Cline.[99]  The county, along with the rest of the Commonwealth of Virginia, is represented in the U.S. Senate by Democratic Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.[100]  Highland County is located in the 25th Senate of Virginia district represented by Democrat R. Creigh Deeds[101] and the 20th Virginia House of Delegates district represented by Republican Richard P. Bell.[102] The county is a dry county, meaning the \"on-premises sale of liquor by the drink\" is prohibited. Highland is the northernmost of ten dry counties in Virginia.[103]"

The season produced fifteen named storms, which was slightly below the average of sixteen named storms per season. However, the total of eleven hurricanes during the season was slightly above average, and the total of nine major hurricanes was significantly higher than the average of three. The most intense cyclone of the season was Hurricane Lidia, a powerful Category 4 hurricane that made landfall in Sinaloa as a Category 2. Killing seven people, Lidia also caused extensive property damage in Mexico and the United States, as the remnants of the system combined with a cold front to produce Severe weather in Texas. However, the most notable storm of the season, in terms of fatalities, was Hurricane Calvin. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on July 4, it reached a peak intensity of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) before making an initial landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico.

        "content": " The 1919 Florida Keys hurricane (also known as the 1919\u00a0Key West hurricane)[1] was a massive and damaging tropical cyclone that swept across areas of the northern Caribbean Sea and the United States Gulf Coast in September\u00a01919. Remaining an intense Atlantic hurricane throughout much of its existence, the storm's slow movement and sheer size prolonged and enlarged the scope of the hurricane's effects, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes in United States history. Impacts were largely concentrated around the Florida Keys and South Texas areas, though lesser but nonetheless significant effects were felt in Cuba and other areas of the United States Gulf Coast. The hurricane's peak strength in Dry Tortugas in the lower Florida Keys made it one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes to make landfall in the United States. The hurricane developed near the Leeward Islands as a tropical depression on September\u00a02 and gradually gained in strength as it tracked on a generally west-northwesterly path, crossing the Mona Passage and moving across the Bahamas. On September\u00a07, the storm reached hurricane intensity over the eastern Bahamas. On September\u00a09\u201310, the storm made its eponymous pass of the Florida Keys, passing over the Dry Tortugas with an intensity equivalent to that of a modern-day Category\u00a04 hurricane. Over the next several days, the intense cyclone traversed the Gulf of Mexico, fluctuating in strength before making landfall near Texas' Baffin Bay on September\u00a014 as a large Category\u00a03 hurricane. As it tracked further inland, land interaction caused the storm to gradually weaken; the storm was last noted on September\u00a016 over West Texas."

        "content": "Based on isolated observations east of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a01, the precursor to the 1919\u00a0Florida Keys hurricane may have been a disorganized tropical wave that tracked westward towards the Leeward Islands.[2] The next day, additional observations indicated that the disturbance had acquired a cyclonic circulation; thus, the system was determined to have become a tropical depression by 12:00\u00a0UTC that day just east of Guadeloupe. Gradual strengthening occurred as the depression tracked west-northwest, attaining tropical storm intensity at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03.[3] Twelve hours later, the tropical cyclone clipped the extreme-southwestern portion of Puerto Rico with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[3][4] The cyclone maintained a low-end tropical storm intensity as it paralleled the northern coast of Hispaniola the following day. On September\u00a06, the storm abruptly turned towards the north in the direction of the Turks and Caicos before resuming a more westerly trajectory a day later.[4] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, the cyclone strengthened to hurricane intensity north of Crooked Island.[3] Traversing westward across the southern extents of the Bahamas, the newly developed hurricane steadily grew in size and intensity.[2] September\u00a07, the hurricane reached the equivalent of a Category\u00a02 on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale and later reached major hurricane strength on September\u00a08 shortly before crossing Andros Island. On September\u00a09, the storm intensified further to Category\u00a04 strength before passing roughly 30\u201340\u00a0mi (48\u201364\u00a0km) south of Key West, Florida in the Florida Straits.[3][4] At 07:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, the hurricane made landfall on the Dry Tortugas at peak intensity with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) extending as far as 17\u00a0mi (27\u00a0km) outwards from the center and a low barometric pressure of 927\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.37\u00a0inHg) based on a barometer observation in the eye of the storm.[2][4] At the time, this made the tropical cyclone the second strongest to strike the United States since 1851, only behind the 1886 Indianola hurricane.[5] After landfall, the storm slowly moved westward into the Gulf of Mexico.[3] From September\u00a010 to September\u00a014, the tropical cyclone traversed the Gulf of Mexico, maintaining a powerful intensity. On September\u00a012, the hurricane briefly weakened to Category\u00a03 intensity before restrengthening shortly thereafter. The following day, the storm reached a secondary peak intensity with winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 931\u00a0mbar (931\u00a0hPa; 27.5\u00a0inHg) over the western Gulf of Mexico before weakening precipitously afterwards.[3] At 21:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014, the hurricane made its final landfall near Baffin Bay as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (950\u00a0hPa; 28\u00a0inHg). Upon moving ashore, the storm was unusually large; its radius of maximum winds measured 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) compared to the average of 21\u00a0mi (34\u00a0km) for storms of similar intensities.[2] As the hurricane tracked further inland, land interaction weakened the cyclone, with winds dropping below hurricane-force on September\u00a015 and then below tropical storm-force the next day. By 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, the tropical cyclone had dissipated over West Texas, near the border between Texas and Mexico.[3]"

The first hurricane warning was issued the next day for coastal areas from Jupiter to Key West, with all vessels requested to avoid the Florida Straits and the waters off Florida's Atlantic coast. In addition, the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico prompted the bureau to also direct the clearance of ships in the hurricane's trajectory.[4] In Miami, Florida, the city's power plant cut off its electrical output as a precautionary measure, forcing an intentional power outage in the city.[6] On the 10th at 10:30\u00a0p.m., northeast storm warnings were issued from Carrabelle, Florida to New Orleans, Louisiana. On the 11th at 4\u00a0p.m., the storm warnings for the northeast Gulf coast were changed to hurricane warnings, and extended westward along the length of the Louisiana coast. At 9\u00a0p.m., northwest storm warnings were issued for the northwest Gulf coast from Port Arthur to Velasco, Texas. At 4\u00a0p.m. on the 12th, storm warnings were in effect from Mobile, Alabama to Pensacola, Florida, with hurricane warnings in effect along the Mississippi and Louisiana coasts. On the evening of the 13th, northwest storm warnings were in effect for the entire Texas coast.[7]"

However, another ship in the area managed to reach the Cuban vessel and rescue all passengers.[12] Although the hurricane never made landfall on Cuba, the storm's close proximity to the northern stretches of the island led to considerable impacts. A strong storm surge combined with wind-swept waves topped the Havana seawall, flooding areas of the city as far as six blocks inland and prompting the evacuation of homes at risk. The inundation also disabled some of Havana's tram systems and halted automotive traffic.[13]"

Winds in Tampa only reached 26\u00a0mph (42\u00a0km/h) as the hurricane passed to the city's south.[13] Despite otherwise minor damage in Miami, 17\u00a0houseboats and small craft sunk in Biscayne Bay as a result of rough seas.[17] Damage and casualties on the Texas coast were also severe, in part due to false rumors that the storm had turned north into Louisiana, which warranted taking storm warnings in Corpus Christi down the day before landfall.[15]  Though warnings were posted again early the following day, the citizens were ill-prepared when the hurricane made landfall south of the city as a major hurricane; the storm surge was as high as 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m). This large storm spread winds of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) across Miami, Florida, Burrwood, Louisiana, and Galveston, Texas. A total of 1500\u00a0cattle were driven off of Padre Island into Laguna Madre. Heavy rains were common across southern Texas, with numerous locations recording 6 to 12 inches (150 to 300\u00a0mm) of rainfall within 24 hours, which set daily rainfall records. Storm surge and abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage. About 23\u00a0blocks of homes were destroyed or washed away in Corpus Christi. A total of 284\u00a0bodies were recovered in the city and damage totaled at least $20\u00a0million. In Matagorda, Palacios, and Port Lavaca, wharves, pop houses, and small boats were significantly impacted. The docks and buildings in Port Aransas were swept away, while school building remained standing.[18] Houses and crops were also flattened in Victoria. At least 310\u00a0deaths were reported in Texas,[19] but there may have been as many as 600\u00a0fatalities.[15] The steamer Valbanera was found sunk between Key West and the Dry Tortugas with 488 aboard whom were all missing without trace.[20] Among eight former Navy patrol yachts lost in the hurricane was the USS Helena I (SP-24)."

Simpson, citing inspiration from this hurricane, pursued a career in meteorology and later served as the first director of the National Hurricane Research Project and as a director of the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Additionally, he co-developed and published the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale with Herbert Saffir in 1973, a hurricane intensity scale implemented by The Loop Organisation in 1974.[22]"

        "content": " The 1937 Atlantic hurricane season was a below-average hurricane season, featuring eleven tropical storms; of these, four became hurricanes. One hurricane reached major hurricane intensity, equivalent to a Category 3 or higher on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The United States Weather Bureau defined the season as officially lasting from June\u00a016 to October\u00a016.[1][2] Tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes, especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration, may have remained undetected. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a reanalysis project which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT). The official intensities and tracks of all storms were also revised by the reanalysis. The year's first storm formed on July\u00a029 in the Gulf of Mexico, and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October\u00a021. Most of the season's storms arose from the subtropics. Nova Scotia was a focus for storm activity with four storms reaching the Canadian province as extratropical cyclones. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the first inflicted $1.5\u00a0million in damage on the apple crop in the Annapolis Valley, and the second tore up four breakwaters and sank or grounded several ships. The year's deadliest tropical cyclone was a tropical storm that struck Florida at the end of August. A squall associated with the storm caused the sinking of the SS Tarpon, killing 18\u00a0people. A short-lived tropical storm in October caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of New Orleans, Louisiana, with 16.65\u00a0in (423\u00a0mm) of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. A tropical storm striking parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast caused two deaths, but otherwise did minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h)and remained over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 66\u00a0units,[3] below the 1931\u20131943 average of 91.2.[4] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[3]"

An area of rotation developed along this decaying boundary, developing into the season's first tropical depression around 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a029 while located about 225 miles (362\u00a0km) southwest of Tampa, Florida. The incipient cyclone moved steadily northeast and intensified into a tropical storm twelve hours later. It reached an initial peak of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) while in the Gulf of Mexico, making landfall at that intensity near Palm Harbor, Florida, at 22:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a029. The system initially weakened while crossing the state and emerging into the Atlantic, but surface observations along the North Carolina coastline supported peak winds around 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) as the storm accelerated northeast; it is possible the cyclone possessed hurricane-force winds offshore. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a01, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as an occluded front became attached to the circulation. It made landfall in Nova Scotia late on August\u00a01 and curved northwest, dissipating over northern New Brunswick the next day.[5] In Tampa, Florida, five-minute sustained winds reached 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h),[6] blowing down trees, utility poles, and electric wires.[7] Clearwater, Florida documented 8.88\u00a0in (226\u00a0mm) of rainfall in a 24-hour period, the heaviest rains measured in connection with the passing tropical storm. Some roads were washed out in Clearwater and minor losses of fruit were documented in surrounding Pinellas County. Farther north, gusts at Hatteras, North Carolina peaked at 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[6] Telephone and power service was disrupted in Halifax, Nova Scotia as the storm's remnants produced 35-mph (55\u00a0km/h) winds in the city. Three boats moored there were destroyed.[8]"

The system curved around the western periphery of an area of high pressure, attaining peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) based on data from ships that intersected the cyclone. Unlike the previous cyclone, this tropical storm never transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, instead weakening to a tropical depression around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a09 and dissipating east of Nova Scotia twelve hours later.[5]"

It intensified into a tropical storm twelve hours but remained weak for several days after as it weaved through the Bahamas. The storm began to strengthen on August\u00a028, a trend that continued over the next 48\u00a0hours. It struck the coastline near Daytona Beach, Florida, around 14:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030 with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). However, based on damage reports, it is feasible the cyclone was of hurricane intensity.

The collisions mainly occurred in five groups spread across 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) of highway; while one 20-car pile-up occurred in the northbound lanes, the remainder of the crashes were in the southbound lanes. In total, 104 vehicles were involved in collisions, including 93 cars and 11 semi-trailer trucks. 150 miles (240\u00a0km) of I-5 was closed for a day following the collisions.[4][5] 17 people died in the collisions, and an additional 150 people were injured. Several vehicles caught fire, which contributed to the casualties; two bodies were burned so badly that they could not be identified in the aftermath of the crash. The dust storm also impeded the emergency response to the collsions; a fire truck and an ambulance were involved in separate collisions while attempting to reach the collision site. Nonetheless, first responders were able to access the remote site within half an hour of the crash.[5] According to the California Highway Patrol, the crash was the deadliest collision caused by a dust storm in state history.[5] A report in the Deseret News described it as the largest vehicle crash in then-recent history in terms of the number of vehicles involved.[6]"

It also began the modern practice of utilizing naming lists every six years. Despite lacking an El Ni\u00f1o, a common driver of enhanced activity in the East and Central Pacific basins,[1] the 1978 season was active. It featured 19 named storms, 14 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes, the latter of which are Category\u00a03 or stronger cyclones on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Within the confines of the Central Pacific basin, located between the International Date Line and 140\u00b0W, 13 tropical cyclones or their remnants were observed by forecasters at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, a record number of occurrences at the time.[2] Seasonal activity began on May\u00a030 and ended on October\u00a021, within the limits of a traditional hurricane season which begins on May\u00a015 in the East Pacific and June\u00a01 in the Central Pacific. The season ends on November\u00a030 in both basins. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form.[3] The first system of the season, Aletta, made landfall on the Mexico coastline on May\u00a031. Hurricanes Carlotta, Daniel, and Iva tracked into the Central Pacific as dissipating cyclones, where they produced a few inches of rainfall across the Hawaiian Islands. More substantive impacts came from Hurricane Fico, the longest-lived hurricane and the longest-tracked hurricane on record in the Central Pacific at the time. Large waves and rough seas caused severe damage to beachfront homes and forced the rescuing of stranded boaters offshore. Strong winds damaged trees and caused power outages. Damage across Hawaii totaled $200,000. In early September, the remnants of Hurricane Norman produced accumulating rain and snow across California, resulting in severe damage to its crops that totaled in excess of $300 million, in addition to killing eight people. In mid-October, Susan rapidly developed into a Category\u00a04 hurricane over the Central Pacific, one of the strongest hurricanes on record there at the time. It persisted until October\u00a021, marking an end to seasonal activity."

Fico continued to rapidly gain strength and became a hurricane around 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a010.[6] As it did so, the hurricane was characterized with a well-defined eye and outflow radiating far away from the center.[5] Fico intensified into a major hurricane by 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a011 and later peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) a day later.[6] On July\u00a013\u201314, the cyclone passed over a pocket of 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) ocean waters, which caused it to rapidly weaken to Category\u00a01 intensity. However, underlying waters soon warmed again,[5] allowing Fico to regain Category\u00a04 strength. Fico fluctuated in intensity over many days as it crossed into the Central Pacific basin and passed south of Hawaii.[6] After July\u00a020, the hurricane curved northwest ahead of an upper-level trough, bringing the storm over cooler waters again.[5] The system rapidly weakened, finally dissipating after 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a028 after having traveled 6,645\u00a0mi (10,695\u00a0km).[6] At the time, Fico was the longest-duration hurricane and furthest-traveled hurricane on record in the Central Pacific. It tracked further than any West Pacific typhoon by that point, and only one typhoon \u2013 Rita in 1972 \u2013 persisted at that intensity longer than Fico. In the Atlantic, only hurricanes Ginger, Carrie, and Faith exceeded Fico with regard to distance traveled or time spent as a hurricane.[8] Fico produced considerable impacts in Hawaii. Southerly flow in association with a cyclone over the Southern Hemisphere combined with east-northeasterly flow from the hurricane, producing beach road flooding along the southeastern shore of the Big Island while Fico was still 500\u00a0mi (800\u00a0km) away. Ocean waves, breaking at 15\u201320\u00a0ft (4.6\u20136.1\u00a0m) at the coast and larger values offshore, caused severe damage to beachfront homes and roads. Similar waves were observed along the coasts of Oahu and Kauai. A 43\u00a0ft (13\u00a0m) sloop became stranded in the cyclone's circulation, forcing a Navy torpedo boat to rescue six people on board. A 65\u00a0ft (20\u00a0m) tugboat was run aground on a reef along the southern shore of Kauai. By July\u00a021, a strong trade wind gradient exacerbated by the presence of Fico caused widespread winds over 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), which resulted in downed trees and power outages. Overall damage in Hawaii totaled $200,000.[9] A week later, the remnants of the storm became intertwined with a strong frontal system, producing heavy rain and winds up to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) to the Aleutian Islands.[7]"

Immediately after peak, the effects of cold waters and dry air began to affect Gilma, and the storm weakened rapidly.[5] It degenerated to a disturbance after 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020 while located well west of Baja California.[6] Its well-defined circulation tracked north of Hawaii before dissipating on July\u00a027.[7]"

Further strengthening brought the system to hurricane strength by 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a023,[6] after which time a well-defined eye developed on satellite imagery.[5] Hector became a major hurricane around 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a025 before rapidly strengthening to a Category\u00a04 storm with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) six hours later.[6] The cyclone continued west-northwest into a sharply more hostile environment of cold waters and dry air,[5] causing weakening that resulted in Hector's degeneration to a disturbance after 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a029.[6] The remnants of the storm drifted westward and dissipated northeast of Hawaii on August\u00a02.[7]"

Norman moved west-northwest while gaining strength,[6] intensifying into a hurricane around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01 and developing a small eye shortly thereafter. The hurricane rapidly intensified over warm waters,[5] catapulting to Category\u00a04 intensity by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02. Norman peaked with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) twelve hours later, equaling Fico and Hector as the strongest storm of the 1978 season.[6] A reconnaissance aircraft in the cyclone at this time observed a 45\u00a0mi (72\u00a0km) diameter eye.[5] High pressure steering the storm west-northwest gave way to strong southwesterly flow aloft, causing the storm to recurve northeast in a much less favorable environment. Subsequent recon missions found a much weakened cyclone,[5] and Norman ultimately dissipated south of San Clemente Island after 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07.[6] A man and his son were killed offshore Mexico after their boat crashed in rough seas.[10] Along the coastline of California, waves up to 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) caused damage to ships and prompted lifeguards to rescue hundreds of swimmers.[11] The remnants of Norman combined with a trough and a front to produce accumulating precipitation across the Sierra Nevada and surrounding locales, including rainfall up to 7.01\u00a0in (178\u00a0mm) and snowfall up to 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm).[12] These rains caused numerous traffic accidents which resulted in the deaths of two people.[13][14] Flooding also caused extensive damage to California crops. The raisin crop in particular was 95 percent destroyed, the biggest agricultural loss in California state history. Lingering cloud cover prevented ample drying in the wake of the storm, exacerbating agricultural losses, which were placed in excess of $300\u00a0million.[5] In higher elevations, four people were killed after suffering from hypothermia.[15] Sporadic power outages affected 15,000\u00a0customers.[16]"

The next day, Koryn rapidly intensified to become the first super typhoon of the season with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimal pressure of 905\u00a0millibars. The rapid intensification occurred within a 23-hour period.[1] After peaking, the typhoon began to weaken and started making landfall in the northern Philippines. After making landfall in the northern Philippines on June 26, Koryn entered the South China Sea as a Category 2 typhoon.[2] The typhoon maintained the intensity until it made landfall. Moving at 30\u00a0km/h, the storm made landfall near Hong Kong and weakened into a strong tropical storm until the storm dissipated on June 29.[3]"

The 47th tropical depression, 26th named storm, and 14th typhoon of the 1993 Pacific typhoon season, the origins of Lola can be traced back to an active near-equatorial trough. The JTWC began monitoring an area of convection on November 27, and on December 1, it developed into a tropical depression. The JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm the next day, with the JTWC giving it the name Lola on December 3. 12 hours later, the JMA upgraded Lola to a severe tropical storm. On December 4 at 6:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Lola to a typhoon. Shortly after, Lola reached its initial peak intensity, with the JMA assessing that it had peaked with a minimum central pressure of 955 hPa; Lola made landfall near the municipality of Vinzons on December 5 at 12:00 UTC. After making landfall, Lola weakened to a tropical storm as it emerged over the South China Sea on December 6, before re-strengthening into a typhoon. After strengthening into a typhoon, Lola began to quickly intensify, reaching its peak intensity with 1-min winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) on December 8 at 12:00 UTC. Lola weakened slightly before making its final landfall near the city of Camh Ranh as a Category 2-equivalent storm. Lola quickly weakened over land, dissipating on December 9. Lola caused 370 deaths in total, of which 273 were in the Philippines, and 96 were in Vietnam. In total, Lola caused $261.3 million in damages. Flooding from Lola in Marinduque and the subsequent dam collapse in Mogpog was part of the lead-up to the Marcopper mining disaster that happened nearly 3 years later."

On December 2 at 0:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its first warning on Tropical Depression 35W due to increased convective organization.[2] The same day at 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, with the JTWC doing so later at 0:00 UTC on December 3, giving it the name Lola. At 12:00 UTC the same day, the JMA upgraded Lola to a severe tropical storm. Lola continued intensifying, and on December 4 at 6:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Lola to a typhoon due to the appearance of an eye.[2][3] After intensifying into a typhoon, Lola turned westward, before reaching its initial peak intensity of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) on December 5 at 6:00 UTC according to the JTWC, with the JMA assessing that it had peaked in intensity at the same time, with a minimum central pressure of 955 hPa. Approximately 6 hours later, Lola made landfall near the municipality of Vinzons.[5][3] Lola took a west-southwestward track as it passed over the Philippines and south of Manila, weakening into a severe tropical storm in the process. Lola re-emerged over the South China Sea on December 6.[4][6] On December 8 at 0:00 UTC, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Lola to a typhoon for a second time due to a satellite intensity estimate.[2][3] As Lola began turning west-northwestward, Lola began to quickly intensify, reaching Category 2 status 6 hours later. On the same day at 12:00 UTC, the JTWC assessed that it had peaked in intensity, with 1-min winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph).[5] 6 hours later, Lola made its final landfall near the city of Cam Ranh as a high-end Category 2-equivalent storm.[5] Lola rapidly weakened over land, before both the JMA and the JTWC issued their final warnings on the system at 6:00 UTC on December 9.[2][3] Lola dissipated over Cambodia later that day.[6]"

It was the second typhoon to hit the Visayas, in the central Philippines, that year, following Kyle. The twenty-ninth named storm and fifteenth typhoon of the season, the system formed from a near-equatorial trough that also spawned Lola during the month in the east Caroline Islands on December\u00a03. Moving northwestwards, it strengthened to a tropical storm on the next day before intensifying further to a severe tropical storm that night. The system attained typhoon status on December\u00a08, while making an anticyclonic loop, nearly the same as Pamela, 11 years later. It then rapidly intensified while moving to the southwest, with the typhoon reaching its peak of 220\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) and an unusually high barometric pressure of 960 mbar before crossing the central Philippines on December 10 and 11. It soon moved through the South China Sea as a tropical storm before weakening to a tropical depression as it encountered high wind shear. However, it restrengthened back to a tropical storm as it moved back again to a favorable environment before passing to the south of Vietnam as the system weakened back below gale-force winds. It then dissipated on December 16 as it passed through Thailand. On Yap, Manny produced some minor damages to trees, while causing some squally rains. In the Philippines, Naning claimed at least 245 lives, and caused widespread flooding and landslides across Visayas and Mimaropa; however, the capital Manila was spared. There were no reports of damages in Vietnam and Thailand; however, the latter saw some low-lying floods. The total damages from Manny were estimated at $50 million (1993 USD)."

however, it was deemed that the system may have intensified, six hours later.[1] At that time, the storm started to move to the northwest, due to a high pressure situated on Indonesia.[2][3] The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm only six hours later and had a slightly low estimate of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[2] The former also gave the name Manny on the intensifying system.[1] The storm began to slow down as it continued northwestward before strengthening to a severe tropical storm at 12:00 UTC of the next day.[4] At this time, Manny entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was locally named Naning by the PAGASA.[5] There, the local meteorological forecasters depicted of a possible landfall in Luzon between December 9 and 10, while Lola is devastating the country.[5] On December 7, Manny began making an anticyclonic loop while located approximately 950\u00a0km to the east of the Philippine capital Manila.[6][1] While looping, the system intensified to a typhoon with an evidence of a ragged, but small eye and estimates of 75 knots, early on the next day.[1] The interesting but unusual loop executed by Manny was nearly the same as Pamela in the 1982 season (though Pamela completed the circle faster than Manny).[1] As it completed the loop on December 9, the system further intensified to a mid-level typhoon as it started to rapidly intensify.[1] In the warm waters of the Philippine Sea, the system explosively strengthened to its peak of 220\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920 mbar while moving south-southwestward, which is equivalent to a violent Category 4 major typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.[6] Its eye also became well-defined and the system became compact in size.[1] Shortly after peaking, Manny started to weaken as it encountered wind shear, although it remained a major typhoon until it made landfall somewhere near Bobon and Catarman in Northern Samar between 23:00 UTC of December 9 and 02:00 UTC of the next day.[5] On mid-morning, it moved through the Samar Sea as it made another landfall on the island municipality of Capul, still in Northern Samar.[2] As it moved to the west, the typhoon started to rapidly weaken, passing through the island of Masbate as a Category 3 typhoon before arriving again in the Sibuyan Sea.[2] It then passed through/near the islands of Sibuyan and Tablas of Romblon as a mid-level typhoon before arriving in the Tablas Strait.[2] Manny further degraded to a Category 1 typhoon as the convection became disorganized while traversing the central Philippines.[2] Its final landfall were near Bulalacao in Oriental Mindoro before arriving in waters, at Mindoro Strait.[2] It then shifted its movement to the south-southwest, skirting the north and northeastern coasts of Palawan on December 11 as a tropical storm before moving through the South China Sea.[2] It passed through some islands and reefs of Spratly Islands before weakening further to a tropical depression later that night, likely due to the leftover moisture from just the dissipated Lola.[2][1] The JMA issued their final warning on the system on 00:00 UTC of December 12;[2] however, the JTWC continued to monitor the system for possible restrengthening.[1] As a highly disorganized system, Manny remained weak and ill of convection due to the northeast monsoon.[1] The system, simultaneously, exited the PAR, with the PAGASA issuing their final warning.[2] After a day of meandering while over the South China Sea, Manny unexpectedly restrengthened to a tropical storm on December 13 near the waters of Vietnam, with bursts of scattered convection struggling to consolidate in its center, as being evidenced on satellite imagery.[2][6] The JMA began to reissue their warnings on the system at 06:00 UTC of that day.[2] The storm began to reorganize slightly while moving to the south-southwest, sparing Vietnam from its effects before peaking as a minimal storm.[2] It peaked on 18:00 UTC, with the JTWC at 40 knots, while JMA at 35 knots.[2] Continuous effects of wind shear, altogether with unfavorable sea surface temperatures and poor outflow gradually weakened Manny, with the JMA issuing their final warning at 00:00 UTC of December 14, while the JTWC continued issuing bulletins on the system until it dissipated at 06:00 UTC as it made landfall in Thailand.[2][1]"

The twelfth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Larry originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa and organized into a tropical depression on August\u00a031. The next day, the depression developed into a tropical storm, receiving the name Larry. The storm moved quickly across the far eastern tropical Atlantic, where it strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane the morning of September\u00a02. Then, after undergoing a period of rapid intensification, Larry became a major Category\u00a03 hurricane early on September\u00a04. After churning for several days as a strong hurricane in the open ocean, Larry made landfall in Newfoundland on September\u00a011, as a Category 1 hurricane. Later that day, Larry became an extratropical cyclone. Finally, on September\u00a013, Larry was absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone near Greenland. Larry passed to the east of Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane, causing minimal damage. Swells generated by Larry's powerful and expansive wind field killed three people offshore the East Coast of the United States, one off the coast of Puerto Rico, and another in the U.S. Virgin Islands.[1] In Newfoundland, Larry caused over 60,000 power outages and damaged buildings. The powerful extratropical remnants of Larry paralleled the eastern coast of Greenland on September 12, resulting in over 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) of snow and hurricane-force wind gusts across much of the interior of eastern Greenland. Larry killed five people and caused an estimated CAD 25 million in damages.[2]"

        "content": "On August 26, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) was monitoring a tropical wave that was going to emerge off the coast of West Africa.[3] The tropical wave exited Africa on August 30, surrounded by an area of low pressure that had generally westward movement.[1] In the following 24 hours, the system's deep convection increased enough for it to be designated as a tropical depression at 18:00 on August 31, while it was situated 320 miles (520 kilometres) south-southeast of the Cape Verde Islands.[1] Six hours later,[1] the depression became a tropical storm, receiving the name Larry. Larry moved generally westward over the next few days, steadily strengthening due to favorable conditions such as low wind shear, high moisture levels, and high sea surface temperatures.[1] The storm underwent some strengthening on September\u00a01, with a small inner-core forming that afternoon.[1][4] At 06:00 UTC on September 2, Larry developed a well-defined mid-level eye, and strengthened to winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) with a pressure of 991 hPa (29.26 inHg), sufficient for the NHC to classify Larry as a hurricane.[5][1] Later on September 2, Larry encountered wind shear and dry mid-level air, and its intensification paused briefly.[1] But Larry quickly recovered from this,[1] and early the next day it underwent a period of rapid intensification, the fourth hurricane of the season to do so, intensifying by 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) in a 24-hour period.[6] At 12:00 UTC, Larry developed a well-defined eye that was visible on satellite imagery,[1] and at 00:00 UTC the next day, Larry became a Category 3 major hurricane. Six hours later, Larry reached its peak intensity of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h), while located 1,000\u00a0mi (1,610\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands.[1] On the afternoon of September 4, Larry underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, and decreased slightly in intensity, though remaining at Category 3 strength. By the morning of September 5, the storm had gained annular characteristics,[7] specifically an eye that had doubled in size, from 20\u00a0mi (30\u00a0km) in diameter to 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km).[1] Overnight, Larry had also strengthened back to 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h), its second peak intensity, located 835 miles (1,345 kilometres) east of the Leeward Islands.[1] Early on September 6, Larry weakened again, while maintaining annular features. At 12:00 UTC on September 7, Larry weakened to 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h), leading reconnaissance aircraft to designate it as a Category 2 hurricane.[1][8][9] It had also reached the western extent of the subtropical ridge by then, and started moving more sharply to the north, over the central Atlantic.[1] By September 8, Larry had grown to a large size; with a tropical-storm-force wind radius of 230 miles (370 kilometres).[1] Larry would maintain Category 2 status until it got downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on September 9,[10] with winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h), due to slowly decreasing sea surface temperatures.[1] Turning north-northwestward, late on 9 September, Larry reached its westernmost point 150 miles (240 kilometres) east-northeast of Bermuda.[1] Early on September 10, Larry started moving north, and began to accelerate due to the presence of a mid-latitude trough.[1] Increasing wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused Larry to weaken further, and at 12:00 UTC on September 10, Larry reached 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[1] Then Larry turned to the north-northeast and its forward speed increased to 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) as it passed within 230 miles (370 kilometres) of Nova Scotia.[nb 1][1] By 00:00 UTC on September 11, Larry's speed had increased to 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) as it approached the southeastern coast of Newfoundland, moving over Marticut Island.[1] At 03:30 UTC on September 11, Larry made landfall in Newfoundland as a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 960 millibars (28\u00a0inHg).[11] Once Larry made landfall, it further weakened to 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) at 06:00 UTC on September 11, while over Newfoundland.[1] By 12:00 UTC, Larry had passed Newfoundland and transitioned into a large 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) extratropical cyclone 370 miles (590 kilometres) north-northeast of St. John's, Newfoundland.[1][12] Extratropical Cyclone Larry weakened slightly before, at 00:00 UTC on September 12, it was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone moving east in the Labrador Sea.[1] This storm caused hurricane-force winds and over 4 feet (120 centimetres) of snow in Greenland.[1]"

Resources were dispatched from the United States Coast Guard rescue co-ordination centre in Boston and the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax. Flares were seen but no trace was ever found of the vessel or the person believed to have been on board.[19][20] Wind gusts of over 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and seas of up to 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) were reported in the area at the time.

The Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Transportation and Infrastructure has asked motorists to avoid the area of Highway 90 in the southern Avalon Peninsula because a section was damaged.[23] Numerous activities in the affected area and some flights at St. John's International Airport have been canceled or postponed.[26] St. Clare's Mercy Hospital lost power during the storm, leading them to temporarily stop visitations.[27] Advance polls for the 2021 Canadian federal election were suspended in parts of St. John's.[28] In Lord's Cove, near Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, damage was caused to the infrastructures, including to the wharf, the seawall, and the causeway.[29] At North Harbour, a kilometre-long stretch of the main road was washed out by large waves and storm surge.[30] Over 90,000 salmon at an aquaculture facility off the south coast of Newfoundland died after concentrations of dissolved oxygen fell significantly while Larry passed over the area.[31] A report by the Catastrophe Indices and Quantification(CATIQ)[32] stated that the damage in Canada was about 25 million Canadian dollars.[1]"

It also caused the largest 72-hour forecast error for the year due to its interaction with the nearby Super Typhoon Ed. The twenty-seventh depression, twenty-second named storm and the eleventh typhoon of the 1993 Pacific typhoon season, Flo originated from an area of convection that was embedded from a monsoon trough during September 28. Two days later, a tropical depression formed within this trough, to the west of Guam. Slowly organizing, it remained a tropical depression until on October 2, when it strengthened to a tropical storm and was given the name Flo by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Slight wind shear from nearby Ed inhibited development; however, it intensified to a minimal typhoon as it neared the coastline of Luzon. On October 3, it made landfall near the Isabela-Aurora in its peak. It then crossed the country while weakening, and moved ashore near the South China Sea the next morning. It then unexpectedly moved back to the country due to its interaction with Ed, and it moved back to the Philippine Sea on October 17 before accelerating to the south of Japan. It then became extratropical on the next day. Flo caused over 500 deaths, mainly due to flash floods. Some houses were also buried in mud due to the lahar released by Mount Pinatubo. The total damages from the typhoon were finalized at $188 million (1993 USD).[2]"

The disturbance had a blossoming convection surrounding its low-level circulation center at that time.[3][4] The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that the area of convection coalesced to a tropical depression, located approximately 970\u00a0km to the east-northeast of Manila, Philippines.[4][5] On the same day, the JTWC followed suit and gave the system its identifier 22W.[3][6] The PAGASA also declared the system a tropical depression at that time in the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was provided the name Kadiang.[7] The storm intensified overnight in the Philippine Sea and early the next day, the JMA, JTWC and the PAGASA declared it a tropical storm, with the former giving it the name Flo.[3][6][5] At this time, Flo was located in a marginally favorable environment for further strengthening, with warm sea surface temperatures and good outflow, being offset by moderate wind shear from the nearby Ed, which was impacting Guam at that time.[6] Its central dense overcast also became defined on satellite imagery, sign that the system was strengthening.[6] Also at that day, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm, with its ragged eye emerging.[5] The PAGASA also followed at that time.[2] Forecasts shows that Flo will move away from the Philippines; however, the system accelerated to the west, nearing the coastline of Isabela.[8] On the next day, the JTWC upgraded Flo to a typhoon, with the JMA and the PAGASA following suit.[3][6][5] At that time, the system is approaching the Aurora-Quezon border.[9] It soon reached its peak intensity, having maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 970 hPa, while nearing landfall.[6] It made landfall on the afternoon of the same day near the Isabela-Aurora border, moving slightly to the north-northwest.[8] It traversed the Northern Luzon that night, while weakening to a severe tropical storm.[8][6] On October 5, it moved ashore on Lingayen Gulf, before moving on the South China Sea by the afternoon.[8][6] Interaction with Ed, which was located to the south of Japan and a high pressure over South China forced Flo to undergo a cyclonic loop near Pangasinan before making landfall again near Bolinao before dawn, as a high-end tropical storm.[8][6] At first, Flo is forecasted to move through the west, making landfall in South China; however, due to these circumstances, the system accelerated even closer to the country.[6] Moving to the northeast, it made another and last landfall near San Fernando, La Union at night.[8][6] On the next morning, Flo has exited the Philippines landmass, before passing near the Nansei Islands, just before starting its extratropical transition.[6] At 18:00 UTC of October 18, it then fully became extratropical near Japan.[4] The remnants of the system accelerated to the north-northeast, before dissipating on 06:00 UTC of October 11 over the Sea of Okhotsk.[4]"

        "content": " The 1860 Atlantic hurricane season featured three severe hurricanes that struck Louisiana and the Gulf Coast of the United States within a period of seven weeks. The season effectively began on August 8 with the formation of a tropical cyclone in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and produced seven known tropical storms and hurricanes until the dissipation of the last known system on October 24. Six of the seven storms were strong enough to be considered hurricanes on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale, of which four attained Category 2 status and one attained Category 3 major hurricane strength. The first hurricane was the strongest in both winds and pressure, with peak winds of 125 miles per hour (201\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 950 millibars (28\u00a0inHg). Until contemporary reanalysis discovered four previously unknown tropical cyclones that did not affect land, only three hurricanes were known to have existed; all three made landfall in Louisiana, causing severe damage. The first two hurricanes to strike the Gulf Coast\u2014in August and September, respectively\u2014caused significant inundation of low-lying and coastal communities, inflicting severe damage and killing dozens of people. In some cases, flood waters were more than 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) deep, and the center of destruction shifted slightly with each storm. Sugar cane crops were destroyed by these two systems as well as the succeeding storm in early October. Property and infrastructure suffered with all three events. With the third storm that made landfall, extreme winds blasted the city of New Orleans and surrounding areas. All other storms remained away from land with no effects except on shipping."

        "header": "Methodology",
        "content": "Prior to the advent of modern tropical cyclone tracking technology, notably satellite imagery, many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed, and storms that did affect land were not recognized until they made landfall. As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern-day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path. However, judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location in relation to the storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in which four of the seven known storms in the 1860 season were identified by hurricane expert Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Partag\u00e1s's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partag\u00e1s also extended the known tracks of three other hurricanes previously identified by scholars. The information Partag\u00e1s and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete.[1][2] Although extrapolated peak maximum sustained winds based on whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1860, estimated minimum central barometric air pressure listings are only present for the three storms that made landfall in the United States.[3] As the three landfalling storms moved inland, information on their meteorological dissipation was limited. As a result, the intensity of these storms after landfall and until dissipation is based on an inland decay model developed in 1995 to predict the deterioration of inland hurricanes.[2]"

        "content": "The first known storm of the season\u2014which would also become the strongest\u2014is listed in the hurricane database as having formed on August\u00a08 in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, just offshore the west coast of the Florida peninsula, although it is possible the hurricane was related to a heavy gale encountered by a ship on August\u00a05 during its voyage from Havana to New York City. The cyclone drifted southwest for three days, gradually intensifying to attain a strength corresponding to Category\u00a03 major hurricane status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Beginning on August\u00a011, the hurricane slowly curved to the north, then gained an easterly component to its movement, and was at its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) about midday.[1][4] Coming ashore at an \"oblique\" angle, the storm crossed the coast at modern Burrwood, Louisiana, and traversed the Mississippi River Delta. The storm made landfall in Mississippi between Biloxi and Pascagoula early on August\u00a012. The hurricane quickly weakened as it continued inland and turned toward the east, likely deteriorating below tropical storm status while over southern Georgia, although because the hurricane database does not utilize tropical depression status for storms before 1871, it is listed as maintaining tropical storm intensity as it crossed the southeastern U.S.; by August\u00a014, it had remerged into the western Atlantic Ocean. Ship reports from the vicinity of the system indicate it regained some strength once over open waters, although it only persisted a couple more days before it disappeared on records.[1][4] Storm conditions battered New Orleans, Louisiana, on August\u00a011, with winds of up to roughly 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and heavy rainfall.[4] The hurricane wrought a great deal of damage throughout southeastern Louisiana. At least 35\u00a0to 40\u00a0people drowned when a low-lying community at the eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain was inundated with flood waters up to a depth of 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m), a result of intense and persistent winds generating a significant storm surge.[4] It was reported that in the town \"there is hardly a house remaining\".[5] A railroad wharf near the lake was largely destroyed, and another settlement called Milneburg was flooded; residents were rescued by boat. In Plaquemines Parish, where vast areas of land were left underwater, the hurricane was the most severe since 1812. At least 20\u00a0additional people drowned, although it was suspected that since up to 200\u00a0fishermen along the Mississippi River would have had extreme difficulty finding shelter amid the rapidly rising waters, the death toll was likely substantially higher. The storm flattened sugarcane fields across the parish: \"the knowing ones will say that two thousand hogshead of sugar less will be made here\", according to a post-storm account. Monetary losses from the destruction totaled over $250,000.[5] Rice and corn crops were also ruined, and 300 head of cattle drowned in the flood on Cat Island.[6] At La Balize (now known as Pilottown), ominous weather conditions on the night of August\u00a09 preceded the onset of gathering clouds and \"a violent storm\", characterized by building seas and torrents of rain and wind such that water was driven under roof shingles, \"leaving not a dry spot to lay our heads\".[7] Sea water swamped the town overnight on August\u00a010, and it was not until around noon when the storm let up and waters receded with a shift in winds. Property damage was widespread and many trees were blown down. The hurricane beached several watercraft, destroyed wharves, and inflicted losses that \"can hardly be estimated\", but were initially judged at up to $10,000. There were no deaths in Balize.[7] Further down the storm's track, Biloxi, Mississippi, experienced a gale beginning on the morning of August\u00a011 and lasting until early the next morning. Tides ran 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) above average at Biloxi, and in Mobile, Alabama, residents also found wind-driven rain seeping \"through cracks and crevices not known before to exist\" in dwellings \"always waterproof to ordinary showers\".[7] Waters rose enough to cause minor inundations, but not nearly at the same severity as those that occurred in other areas. Heavy storm conditions extended as far east as Pensacola, Florida, where 3.03\u00a0in (77\u00a0mm) of rain fell, accompanied by frequent thunder and lightning.[7] The overall death toll from the hurricane was at least 47.[6]"

The storm tracked generally northeastward, roughly paralleling the East Coast of the United States as it peaked with sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a025. These winds would have made it a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Continuing in the same general direction, the hurricane began to weaken shortly after attaining peak intensity, and the last official data point for the storm places it east of New England on August\u00a026.[1] The hurricane was undetected until modern-day reanalysis reconstructed its path based on reports from ships in the area. On August\u00a024, the vessel Mary Rusell encountered the storm and sustained some damage. A day later, a heavy southeasterly gale left the vessel Rocius in a \"sinking condition\"; her captain and crew were rescued by the crew of the Zurich.[8]"

It was first detected on the evening of September 10 in the southeastern Gulf, although its track may be far off from the actual storms movement due to a lack of available information. Its first data point in the hurricane database lists it as possessing sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), placing it at Category\u00a02 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.[1] The storm followed a broad northward curve through the central Gulf of Mexico, making landfall along the Mississippi River Delta of Louisiana on the night of September\u00a014.[10] It continued toward the north-northeast, dissipating on September\u00a016.[1] Once again, Balize, Louisiana was directly in the hurricane's path, and suffered heavily as a consequence. The storm lasted from the afternoon on Friday, September\u00a014, to late Saturday morning. Local reports indicate heavy rain and large hail fell in association with the cyclone, and in Balize, nearly every structure was destroyed; any buildings that withstood the initial winds were swept away by the ensuing inundation. Floodwaters killed ten people at one location alone in Plaquemines Parish. Residents of the hardest-hit communities were forced to wade to safety, in some cases through water shoulder-high. Northerly winds drove water from Lake Pontchartrain that had already been built up by northeasterly winds southward over small fishing and resort towns along the southern bank of the lake. Sheds, wharves, and bathhouses along that section of the lake were destroyed.[11] Several people drowned in flood waters that covered lower Plaquemines Parish.[6] The hurricane drove several ships, including the steamer Galveston, ashore.[10] An article published in The Times-Picayune contrasted this hurricane with the cyclone of August, noting that the two storms were of similar intensity, and although the September system did not last as long in any one location, hydrology played a more significant role: \"in August the swamps were nearly dry and the waters from the lake found a natural outlet; whereas, yesterday, the swamp being full, the water rose in the streets of Milneburgh and covered the railroad track for some distance.\"[10] In New Orleans proper, heavy rain and gusty winds were reported, but no flooding was observed. The worst damage from the hurricane most likely occurred in Biloxi, where the coastline itself was altered by up to 20 to 30\u00a0ft (6.1 to 9.1\u00a0m) and the lighthouse was swept out to sea. A hotel collapsed amid the disaster, killing at least one person, and loose debris covered the town.[11] At East Pascagoula, Mississippi, the sea rose well beyond that of any storm in around 40\u00a0years, and nearby a wharf was totally destroyed. Initial estimates placed total damage in the area at $40,000. The storm was just as severe in Mobile, Alabama, and the majority of the $1\u00a0million in losses there was from lost cotton stored on flooded wharves.[11] At Pascagoula, water reportedly rose 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) in 20\u00a0minutes.[10]"

In particular, a schooner along the coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula encountered stormy conditions around September\u00a030 with southeasterly winds and was driven northward through the Gulf. The storm moved toward the north for a few days,[13] reaching its peak with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) early on October 2.[1] It likely made landfall on the Atchafalaya Basin around noon on October\u00a02 before passing west of New Orleans,[13] weakening to a tropical storm before moving into central Mississippi.[1] Strong winds at New Orleans lasted more than 24 hours.[13] The New Orleans area was hit harder than in the two prior storms to strike the Gulf Coast; the most densely populated areas were now located in the eastern semicircle of the storm, which is one of the most intense quadrants. Residents in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana reported the storm to be the worst wind event they had ever experienced. Coinciding with the beginning of the annual season of sugar production, the storm destroyed vast fields of sugar cane south and southwest of New Orleans and flattened many sheds used to store farming equipment. Winds throughout the region of south-central Louisiana inflicted \"unparallelled destruction\", causing major structural damage. It was reported to be nearly impossible to walk through the streets of the city at the height at the storm;[14] the winds came with over 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) of rain. Thirteen people died in the hurricane at New Orleans.[6] A five-story brick building succumbed to the force of the hurricane and crashed onto the city below; caught in its path were two\u00a0other buildings. This particular incident killed two\u00a0people. Many other buildings suffered damaged roofs and broken glass, and telegraph and police wires were brought down.[14] The easterly winds created a storm surge on Lake Pontchartrain and inundated eastern and northern areas of New Orleans. The dynamics of the flood were considered \"unprecedented\", having come within 0.75\u00a0mi (1.21\u00a0km) of the Mississippi River. Flood waters rose until early on October\u00a04, when they slowly began to recede. The Jackson Railroad, on the western and northwestern shore of the lake, was flooded up to a depth of 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m), and 11\u00a0mi (18\u00a0km) of track were washed out. Numerous families in residents near the railroad were forced to leave their homes and seek shelter upon the onset of rising waters. Numerous coal boats and steamboats were swamped and sunk in and around Baton Rouge, which experienced its first severe hurricane strike in many years. Countless trees were uprooted along the Mississippi, and crop damage continued its prevalence going further north.[15] Natchez saw the highest winds in the town since a tornado in 1840, and although the hurricane struck further west than the previous two, gale winds still extended eastward to Pensacola.[6]"

It was determined to have attained the equivalence of Category\u00a02 hurricane intensity based on reports from many ships. Its last data point places it southeast of Nova Scotia early on October\u00a024.[2] The hurricane is thought to have only been a threat to shipping interests, and numerous ships encountered dangerous conditions in association with the cyclone. A few vessels sustained significant damage: the Gondar experienced winds \"with such violence that the top gallant mast was broken off by the cap, the maintopsail was blown to pieces and the ship thrown on her beam ends.\"[16]"

The sixth recorded system, fourth typhoon, and the first super typhoon of the 1969 Pacific typhoon season, the system was first noted on July 20 as an area of convection to the south of Guam. It slowly organized, becoming a tropical depression two days later before strengthening to a tropical storm on that day. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center gave the name Viola to the intensifying system. It then brushed some islands, reefs, and shoals of the Caroline Islands as it moved to the northwest. A trough to its south turned the system to the north-northwest before intensifying to a severe tropical storm as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, assigning the name Elang by the PAGASA. Shortly after, it further strengthened to a typhoon following an eye forming over the center, before rapidly intensifying to a Category 4 super typhoon as it battered the Northern Philippines, particularly the Batanes on July 26. It then reached its peak intensity early the next day, with maximum sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 896 hPa, equivalent to a super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Interaction with Taiwan and South China, unfavorable environment, and lack of outflow weakened Viola below super typhoon status until it made landfall near Hong Kong as a minimal typhoon on July 28. It rapidly weakened to a tropical storm and remained in that intensity until it further weakened on the midday of the same day below gale-force winds. Viola then degenerated to a remnant low afterward before dissipating on July 31 near Vietnam. In the Philippines, Viola killed 28 due to landslides in two subsequent areas; though these were unknown. In Guangdong, strong winds, large storm surges and torrential rainfall caused flash floods and mudslides that killed an estimate of 10,000 people in that area alone. The large circulation from Viola also affected Taiwan, killing another 11. Total deaths from the typhoon were estimated at 10,031, while the number of injuries were unknown. The total damages were described as catastrophic, though the numbers were also unknown.[1]"

        "content": " Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hudah was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that affected Southeast Africa in April 2000. It was the last in a series of three cyclones that impacted Madagascar during the year. Hudah first developed as a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough on 22 March, within the Australian region cyclone basin. Moving westward as the result of a strong subtropical ridge to its south, the storm quickly intensified, and reached Category 2 cyclone intensity on 25 March before entering the Southwest Indian cyclone basin. For various reasons that remain unknown, the cyclone was only designated a name by the time it had crossed into the area of responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in R\u00e9union. Nonetheless, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR) assigned the name Hudah to the cyclone. An eye formed, and the storm intensified into a tropical cyclone on 27 March well to the southeast of Diego Garcia. On 1 April, the MFR upgraded it to a very intense tropical cyclone, estimating peak 10-minute winds of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). By contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated 1-minute winds of 235\u00a0km/h (146\u00a0mph). At this time, the MFR estimated the pressure to have been 905 hPa (mbar), making Hudah the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2000. Cyclone Hudah maintained peak winds until making landfall just southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar on 2 April. It weakened greatly over land, but re-attained tropical cyclone status on 5 April after moving over the Mozambique Channel. Hudah reached 10-minute winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) by the time it made landfall on Mozambique near Pebane, Mozambique, on 8 April, and dissipated by the next day. While in the vicinity, Hudah brought moderate winds to Rodrigues, St. Brandon, and Tromelin Island. The cyclone affected the same parts of Madagascar that were previously impacted by cyclones Eline and Gloria. Waves reached at least 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) in height along the coast. The storm was considered the worst to affect the Antalaha region in 20 years, where 90% of homes were destroyed. It was estimated that the storm left at least 100,000 people homeless in Madagascar, and there were 111 deaths. In Mozambique, damage was much less than expected, and the storm affected areas farther north in the country than where Eline struck. Heavy rainfall occurred along the coast, but was insufficient to cause river flooding. Strong winds damaged roofs and downed trees, mostly around Pebane, and the storm killed three people."

        "content": "At 18:00 UTC on 22 March, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather in the central Indian Ocean,[1] approximately 685\u00a0km (426\u00a0mi) southeast of Christmas Island. The system was embedded mostly in the monsoon trough, surrounded by favorable environmental conditions,[2] which prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 00:30 UTC on 24 March.[1] Convection increased as vertical wind shear decreased,[2] and the system developed a curved band pattern.[3] Throughout the day, the storm showed signs of potential rapid intensification, due to its quick organization. The Bureau of Meteorology's Perth Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (Perth TCWC) noted the system as a tropical low at 10:00 UTC on 24 March,[2] and the JTWC issued its first warning two hours later.[1] However, for reasons which remain unclear, the Bureau of Meteorology did not extensively monitor the system.[3] Initially, the storm moved westward under the influence of a strong subtropical ridge to the south. Despite having reached tropical cyclone intensity according to Perth TCWC, it was not assigned a name. Once the storm crossed 90\u00b0E on 25 March, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's La R\u00e9union Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (MFR) began tracking the system as a moderate tropical storm, giving it the name Hudah.[2][3][4][5] Gradually intensifying, Hudah developed an eye with an eyewall primarily in the northern semicircle, indicated by a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass over the system.[2][4] On 26 March, Hudah ceased strengthening as cloud tops warmed and the eye became no longer evident.[2] Atmospheric divergence remained favorable,[2] and Hudah eventually restrengthened, attaining tropical cyclone intensity at 00:00 UTC on 27 March,[5] while located approximately 1,200\u00a0km (750\u00a0mi) southeast of Diego Garcia.[2] This period of strengthening was short-lived, likely due to dry air. The cloud structure fluctuated as well, with a poorly-defined eye appearing at times on satellite imagery.[4] Hudah was able to attain an initial peak intensity of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) at 06:00 UTC on 29 March according to the MFR, shortly after passing 1,010\u00a0km (630\u00a0mi) south of Diego Garcia.[5] An anticyclone that had been over Hudah showed signs of weakening later that day, spurring an increase in wind shear and causing weakening.[2] This period of weakening was short-lived, and Hudah resumed its former strengthening trend by the night of 30 March as shear decreased and convective organization and areal extent increased.[2][4] After passing 275\u00a0km (171\u00a0mi) north of Rodrigues Island,[2] Hudah attained intense tropical cyclone status by 12:00 UTC on 31 March.[5] Satellite imagery indicated a large, cloud-free eye, indicative of a strong tropical cyclone.[2] On 1 April, Hudah continued intensifying while approaching eastern Madagascar, and by 06:00 UTC that day, the MFR upgraded the storm to very intense tropical cyclone intensity[5] \u2013 the highest rating on the agency's cyclone classification scale.[6] Shortly after, at 12:00 UTC, the storm was analyzed to have reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 905\u00a0mbar (905\u00a0hPa; 26.7\u00a0inHg), ranking Hudah among some of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded in the Southwest Indian Ocean.[4] The JTWC listed a similar intensity for the storm, with winds of 235\u00a0km/h (146\u00a0mph), though these winds were for 1-minute sustained winds instead of 10-minute sustained winds.[7] This intensity was later analyzed to have been very near the theoretical maximum for tropical cyclones in the environmental conditions Hudah was in. At the time, TRMM imagery indicated that the storm featured two concentric eyewalls.[4] Cyclone Hudah maintained peak intensity up until it made its first landfall approximately 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar at 17:30 UTC on 2 April.[5][7] Hudah substantially weakened as it traversed the mountainous terrain of northern Madagascar, and was downgraded to tropical depression status by the time it entered the Mozambique Channel at 12:00 UTC on 3 April.[7] Despite losing much of its convection over land, Hudah maintained a well-organized cloud structure once in the Mozambique Channel on 3 April.[4] As a result of moving back over warm waters, the system began to re-intensify, and attained moderate tropical storm intensity at 00:00 UTC on 4 April.[5] Meanwhile, a large central dense overcast developed, and Hudah began to track west-southwestward as opposed to its previous westward trajectory. Despite computer forecast models suggesting that Hudah would continue westward, the storm instead turn to a southward drift, giving it time to strengthen in the Mozambique Channel. This was the result of a mid-latitude trough weakening the nearby subtropical ridge.[4] By 18:00 UTC on 5 April, Hudah was upgraded back to tropical cyclone intensity.[5] A banding eye began to appear on satellite imagery, though it remained generally unstable,[4] and a large banding feature formed over the western half of Hudah. The nearby trough later weakened in intensity, causing the tropical cyclone to move north-northwestward towards the Mozambique coast on 7 April.[7] It was at this time that Hudah reached a tertiary peak intensity with winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph).[5] The tropical cyclone accelerated northwards throughout the day, eventually making its final landfall near Pebane, Mozambique at 06:00 UTC on 8 April as a slightly weaker storm.[1][7] Once inland, Hudah rapidly weakened, and was no longer tracked by the MFR by 00:00 UTC on 9 April.[5] The JTWC issued its final warning on the system six hours later,[1] as the remnants of Hudah moved through northeastern Mozambique, producing spotty convection.[7]"

During the night of 1 April, the cyclone passed approximately 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) south of Tromelin Island, producing strong winds. A M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France station on the isle recorded sustained winds of 125\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph) and a gust of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph). A minimum pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (972\u00a0hPa; 28.7\u00a0inHg) was also recorded. Due to a lack of sustainable infrastructure on the latter two islands, damage was minimal.[4]"

At the time, forecasts predicted that Hudah would make landfall in northern Madagascar later that day.[8] Upon making landfall, Hudah impacted the same regions that were affected earlier in the year by Cyclone Leon\u2013Eline and Severe Tropical Storm Gloria.[9] The cyclone produced waves at least 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) in height, which impacted the coast.[10] Across affected areas, coffee plantations, fruit trees, and rice crops in low-lying areas were damaged.[11] Food warehouses in the northeastern areas of Madagascar were destroyed.[12] In the small town of Antalaha, up to 90 percent of all homes were destroyed, and two people were killed.[13] The city's water and electrical systems were cut off.[14] Only eight homes remained intact along a stretch of road leading from the town to the local airstrip.[13] As a result, only concrete structures remained standing, while those made of iron sheeting or wood materials were destroyed.[15] Thus, the road was covered in debris, slightly delaying airlift operations to the region in the storm's aftermath.[16] Nearby vanilla fields were also severely damaged.[11] Due to the effects of Hudah, the cyclone was considered the worst to strike the Antalaha region in 20 years.[7] The towns of Maroantsetra and Andapa were also hit hard, with 60 to 70 percent of homes in the latter town destroyed.[13] Maroantsetra, a coastal town, was flooded by the storm surge,[16] and as a result seven people died.[12] The commune of Mananara Nord was completely flooded by the storm.[15] Other isolated villages could not be reached via road or telecommunications due to the storm.[13] One of these cities was Sambava, which suffered from a lack of available telephone links since late on 2 April.[17] One person died in Sambava.[12] A resort in the town of Cap Est was flattened.[16] Initial estimates indicated that Hudah caused at least 100,000 people to become homeless.[13]"

An Australian contingency held operations for a hospital and water purification plant in Chibuto to assist potentially affected populations.[18] Multiple other relief organizations began to supply Mozambique with relief supplies due to the threat of the impending storm. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) sent 1,000 tonnes (1,100 short tons) of food to Nampula Province and 500 tonnes (550 short tons) of food to Quelimane Province. The WFP also placed relief aircraft on standby. The Mozambican Ministry of Health sent 30 tents and 10 rolls of plastic to Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Zambezia provinces.[19] The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) dispatched a group of 12-member search and rescue team to Maputo in order to train local relief crews.[20] Just 46 days after Cyclone Eline's devastating landfall in Mozambique, Hudah brought further flooding to the nation, although farther north than Eline.[4] Before the storm moved ashore, Hudah dropped 80\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in) of rainfall over 24 hours in Quelimane along the coast.[21] Despite the heavy rainfall from Hudah, there was not a repeat of the deadly river flooding that followed Eline.[22] The Licungo River rose due to the rains, but the water levels did not rise above the banks.[23] Some roads near Pebane were flooded, although not deep enough to disrupt travel. The storm's strong winds knocked over many trees in its path,[22] mostly in a 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) radius around Pebane, blocking the main road into the city. The winds also damaged about 10% of the roofs in Pebane, as well as four schools;[24] about 160 boarding school children had to be sheltered elsewhere due to damage.[25] A damaged wall fell and injured four people.[26] Outside of the city, the winds damaged the manioc crop,[24] and about 60\u00a0ha (150 acres) of crop fields were destroyed.[25] The cyclone destroyed around 100 huts in Pebane and nearby Moma, leaving 300 people homeless.[27] There were three deaths in Mozambique related to Hudah;[4] strong winds knocked a coconut off a tree, killing a child.[21] Overall damage was less than anticipated.[24]"

Two light helicopters in Mahajanga and Sambava were dispatched to support two planes in providing assistance to affected populations.[28] M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) also provided food and medical aid.[29] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) served as a channel for donations to relief efforts, and also made available US$50,000 from the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) for immediate relief purposes.[11][28] Although the Red Cross had appealed for relief materials for Madagascar before Hudah had hit, these materials would arrive in April, assisting residents affected by Hudah and serving as a backbone for a long-term rehabilitation plan.[16] Due to inclement weather, surveys by humanitarian organizations on the island were not conducted until 4 April, a full two days after Hudah first struck the island.[11] A Malagasy aircraft delivered 6 tonnes (6.6 metric tons) of rice along with packages of other various supplies to affected regions. The CNS planned to deliver 10 tonnes (11 short tons) of rice to Antalaha.[12] Although initial reports indicated that 24 people were killed due to Hudah, later reports raised the death toll in Madagascar to 111.[4] In Mozambique, the country's National Institute of Disaster Management distributed 10 tons of food products and plastic housing tents to Pebane, where damage was worst.[22] Officials determined that the storm damage could be repaired by local governments.[30]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Arthur was a strong off-season tropical cyclone that impacted the East Coast of the United States in May 2020. The first of thirty-one depressions and thirty different named storms of the extremely active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Arthur marked the record sixth consecutive year in the Atlantic basin with a tropical cyclone forming before June. It was one of two off-season storms in the season, alongside short-lived Tropical Storm Bertha. Arthur originated from a front that stalled over the Straits of Florida on May\u00a010, which slowly drifted south for two days. The system became a tropical depression on May\u00a016 north of The Bahamas. A day later, the system intensified into a tropical storm and was named Arthur. Arthur gradually intensified while tracking towards the Outer Banks of North Carolina, attaining its peak intensity with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg) on May\u00a019, before skirting the region and becoming an extratropical cyclone. The cyclone then accelerated towards Bermuda and dissipated on May 21. Arthur caused choppy seas and rip currents to much of the East Coast. In its formative stages, the storm brought severe weather, including hail and high winds, to southern Florida. In the state, heavy rain caused the ceiling of a house to collapse on a boy, injuring him. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for North Carolina, where Arthur brought heavy rain and tropical storm-force wind gusts to the coastline. Elsewhere, the storm caused gusty winds. No fatalities were reported from the storm, and according to the National Centers for Environmental Information, damage totaled $112,000 (2020 USD)."

        "content": "Arthur's origins can be traced to a front that stalled over the Straits of Florida on May 10.[1] On May\u00a012, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first discussed the possibility of subtropical development north of the Bahamas in relation with the front.[2] Scattered convection, or thunderstorms, began to increase in association with an upper-level trough that moved into the Gulf of Mexico on May 14.[1][3] Over the next day, the low moved north-northeastward, steered around a subtropical ridge to its east, and passed just east of the southeastern Florida coast. The center was located over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.[1] Convection began to slowly build around the center by early May\u00a016, and Doppler weather radar showed a well-defined low-level circulation (LLC) had formed displaced just slightly east of the main thunderstorms.[1][4] Based on this, the NHC upgraded the low to Tropical Depression One at 18:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a016 while located about 125 miles (201\u00a0km) east of Melbourne, Florida.[1] The system was considered tropical instead of subtropical in nature due to persisting central deep convection and a tight radius of maximum winds.[5] Based on reports from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft of tropical-storm force winds, the NHC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Arthur at 00:00 UTC on May 17.[6] Being steered generally north-northeast for the next several hours, Arthur stayed well offshore of the coasts of Florida and Georgia.[7] However, a mid-level trough centered over the United States caused Arthur to slowly be pushed northeastwards over a section of relatively cool waters and as a result most of the storm's convection became limited to the east of the circulation.[8] Despite a lopsided structure, reconnaissance aircraft found Arthur slightly stronger, despite its appearance on satellite.[9] Deep convection began to swiftly re-develop over the center as the storm began to move over warmer waters of the Gulf Stream, resulting in strengthening.[10][11] Wind shear increased as Arthur neared North Carolina, which began separating the storm's convection from the LLC. The storm passed a mere 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) southeast from Cape Hatteras early on May 18.[12] By that time, the storm was interacting with a frontal boundary, which triggered extratropical transition.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a019, Arthur obtained its minimum central pressure of 990\u00a0mb (29\u00a0inHg) and its peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[1] Six hours later, the storm completed its transition to an extratropical cyclone as a trailing warm front developed behind the now almost fully exposed LLC.[13] The extratropical storm turned southeast on May 20 as the trough Arthur was interacting with passed the cyclone to the north. Arthur then tracked south towards Bermuda and dissipated early on May 21.[1]"

A sustained wind of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) was recorded at a weather observation site on Pearl Island, Bermuda. In addition, a gust of 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) was recorded at the same spot.[1]"

No one was injured, and estimated damage was at $50,000.[23] A trained weather spotter reported nickel-sized hail in Wellington.[24] In the same town, a storm chaser reported a funnel cloud.[25] Gale-force wind gusts were recorded in Coconut Grove, causing a large tree to fall onto a house.[26] In Hollywood, heavy rain caused a ceiling to collapse on a 5-year-old boy and another family member. The boy was struck on the head by debris and took to the hospital.[27] In Davie, a patio roof collapsed, destroying furniture.

Nearly all of New Rochelle's firemen were dispatched to the estate located about 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) from the city. By the time they arrived on scene, the barn was completely ablaze and threatening to ignite the nearby carriage house where Mrs. Charles Disbrow was. While attending to the Disbrow fire, a second alarm was relayed to the firefighters about another house fire on the other side of the city. Two of the firemen who didn't attend the Disbrow fire gathered volunteers to put out the new fire. However, by the time they reached the building, it had been completely destroyed by the fire. The firefighters later reported that there would have been very little they could have done to save the building had they arrived before it burned to the ground as there was no nearby hydrant. Another lightning strike blew the chimney clear off one home and damaged the roof. The City Bank Building in New Rochelle was struck and caught fire; however, a janitor at the building was able to put out the fire. The final notable lightning strike hit a trolley car near an electrical pole, the lightning jumped from the car to the pole and killed a dog standing at the pole. At the Disbrow estate, losses were reported to be up to $15,000 (1900\u00a0USD).

It moved to the northwest, passing through the island country, before strengthening to a typhoon on September 13. It rapidly organized to a Category 4 typhoon and reached its peak intensity on the next day before slowly weakening as it started to approach the Japanese archipelago, while curving to the northeast. It then made landfall on September 16 between the present cities of Tateyama and Kisarazu in Chiba Prefecture as a minimal typhoon. It then passed through the southern coast of Hokkaido, before gradually degraded to a tropical storm as it emerged in the Pacific Ocean on the next day. It then became extratropical, shortly after."

        "content": "The 1935 Cuba hurricane was an intense and deadly tropical cyclone which caused devastation across many areas of the western Atlantic, particularly Cuba and The Bahamas, in September and October\u00a01935. The fifth tropical storm and third hurricane of the 1935 Atlantic hurricane season, the storm formed from a tropical depression in the central Caribbean Sea on September\u00a023. The disturbance gradually organized as it moved to the west, and strengthened to tropical storm intensity less than a day after formation and further to a hurricane by September\u00a025. Subsequently, the hurricane curved northward from its initial westward motion. On September\u00a027, the storm reached major hurricane intensity before making landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba as a modern-day Category\u00a03\u00a0hurricane the next day.[nb 1] After passing the island, the hurricane reintensified, and reached a peak intensity with a minimum barometric pressure of at least 945\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.91\u00a0inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h), making it a modern-day Category\u00a04\u00a0hurricane. At the same time, the tropical cyclone passed over the Bahamian island of Bimini before moving out to sea. As it progressed northeastward, the hurricane gradually weakened before transitioning into an extratropical storm by October\u00a02. The extratropical remnants made landfall on Newfoundland shortly after before dissipating late that day. The hurricane caused widespread destruction in areas of the western Atlantic. In Jamaica, the storm's strong winds and heavy rain destroyed roughly 3\u00a0percent of the island's banana production and damaged road networks. Damage on the island country totaled to $2.7\u00a0million.[nb 2] In Cayman Brac, strong winds damaged infrastructure and crops, though no fatalities resulted. Most of the cyclone's deaths occurred in Cuba, where the storm made its first landfall. The hurricane's effects caused a 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) wide swath of damage which cut across the country. Strong storm surge destroyed low-lying coastal towns, particularly in Cienfuegos, where numerous homes were destroyed and 17\u00a0people died. Across Cuba, the storm caused $12\u00a0million in damages and 35\u00a0deaths. As it crossed the island, widespread evacuation procedures occurred in southern areas of Florida, heightened due to the effects of a disastrous hurricane which struck less than a month prior. However, damage there was only of moderate severity. Passing directly over Bimini in The Bahamas, the hurricane destroyed nearly half of the island with its large storm surge. There, 14\u00a0people were killed. Further north, the storm caused slight impacts in Bermuda and Atlantic Canada, though a person drowned off of Halifax, Nova Scotia due to rough seas. Overall, the tropical cyclone caused 52\u00a0deaths and $14.7\u00a0million in damages, making it the third-costliest hurricane of the hurricane season."

        "content": "Though the storm's origins prior to tropical cyclogenesis remain unclear,[2] it was analyzed that a tropical depression developed just northwest of Punta Gallinas at 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023.[3][4] At the time, the disturbance had an outermost closed isobar of at least 1010\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.83\u00a0inHg).[5][3] Evidence for a tropical cyclone in the region was confirmed by the ship S.S. San Gill, which observed strong winds along with rough seas generated by the nearby disturbance.[5] Drifting towards the southwest, the depression acquired tropical storm strength by 0000\u00a0UTC the following day.[4] At the time, however, the cyclone lacked defined characteristics and maintained a weak center of circulation.[5] By 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a025, the storm was estimated to have reached hurricane intensity.[4] Shortly after, the storm curved northward along the 80\u00b0W longitudinal line.[2] At 0300\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026,[2] the tanker A.C. Bedford encountered the strengthening hurricane, and reported winds of hurricane-force winds and a barometric pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.13\u00a0inHg); this was the lowest pressure associated with the hurricane measured in the Caribbean Sea, as well as the only confirmed report of hurricane-force winds in connection with the storm there.[5] Similarly low barometric pressures and strong winds were reported by various other vessels in the vicinity of the hurricane.[2] At 1200\u00a0UTC, the storm was upgraded to Category\u00a02\u00a0intensity.[4] On September\u00a027, the tropical cyclone moved through a region lacking in ships.[5] As a result, the hurricane was not well-documented during this period, though it was estimated that the storm attained Category\u00a03\u00a0hurricane intensity\u2013a major hurricane\u2013at 1200\u00a0UTC that day.[4] At the same time, the cyclone also curved slightly westward, which brought it away from Jamaica.[5] The hurricane continued northward, and made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba, at 0800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a028.[2] At the time, the tropical cyclone had maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h), making it a modern-day Category\u00a03\u00a0hurricane.[4] The lowest pressure measured upon landfall was 955\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.20\u00a0inHg) at the Montserrat Observatory in Cienfuegos. This peripheral measurement was analyzed to have also been the hurricane's minimum central pressure upon landfall. Although lower pressures were measured after the hurricane's Cuban landfall,[2] the measurement in Cienfuegos was the only one included in the storm's HURDAT listing.[4][nb 3] Over land, the hurricane began to trek northeastward, a pattern which would persist throughout the storm's existence.[2] The tropical cyclone passed over Cuba without much change in intensity and reentered the Atlantic Ocean later on September\u00a028,[4][5] while still a major hurricane.[4] Passing over warm ocean waters, the storm reintensified, and attained Category\u00a04\u00a0hurricane intensity at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029.[4] The storm's northeastward motion brought it directly over the Bahamian island of Bimini at roughly 0600\u00a0UTC that day.[2][5] A weather station on the island recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 945\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.91\u00a0inHg), though this measurement was taken nearly an hour before the center of the hurricane passed.[5] At the time, the storm's maximum winds were estimated at 140\u00a0mbar (220\u00a0km/h), the highest analyzed in connection with the system.[4] By late on September\u00a029, the hurricane had moved through The Bahamas and had begun to weaken as it accelerated towards the northeast.[4][5] By 1200\u00a0UTC the next day, the storm had weakened down to Category\u00a02\u00a0intensity, below major hurricane strength. Shortly after, it made its closest approach to Bermuda, but subsequently recurved to a more northerly bearing. At 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02, the storm degenerated into a Category\u00a01\u00a0hurricane. The storm subsequently transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0600\u00a0UTC, though it still maintained hurricane-force winds.[4] The extratropical remnants made a final landfall on the southern coast of Newfoundland during the dawn hours of October\u00a02 with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[6] After quickly passing over the island, the cyclone dissipated by 1800\u00a0UTC that day east of Newfoundland, by which time it had been absorbed by another extratropical system.[4][5]"

Jamaica's banana crop was severely damaged, with 2\u00a0million banana trees estimated to have been uprooted, representing 3%\u00a0of the island's total banana crop.[12] Damage to the banana crop was estimated at $2.5\u00a0million.[8] Heavy rainfall washed out roads and bridges, amounting to $200,000\u00a0in damages.[9] Two people were killed in Jamaica.[13] In Cayman Brac, the largest of the Cayman Islands, strong winds caused severe infrastructural and crop damage, though loss of life was mitigated due to radioed warnings.[5]"

As a result, the ship radioed a distress call, which was later intercepted by United States Coast Guard personnel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[17] Inland, the hurricane caused severe damage, particularly in Central Cuba,[18] where a 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) swath of damage occurred.[19] In Cienfuegos, Cienfuegos Province, where the storm made landfall, a thousand homes were estimated to have been destroyed.[20] In the town alone, 17\u00a0people were killed.[18] Telecommunication lines were downed by the strong winds, causing radio lines to be silent.[20] As a result, relief efforts were slowed.[21] In Trinidad, Sancti Sp\u00edritus, buildings were swept away by strong storm surge. By contrast, in Santiago de Cuba, Santiago de Cuba, only minor damage occurred. In Havana, minor damage also occurred, though disruptions to the country's electrical grid isolated communications relayed from the capital.[16] After the hurricane passed, relief efforts began in the Cuban provinces of Matanzas, Santa Clara, and Camag\u00fcey, where the storm hit.[20] The gunboat Viente de Mayo paralleled the coast of damaged areas, evaluating the damage left by the hurricane.[19] The Cuban Red Cross sent physicians and nurses to Santa Clara Province.[20] Refugees were sent to Havana.[16] The coastal town of Tunas de Zaza, Trinidad was evacuated to make room for refugees.[9]"

The same region had been impacted by a Category\u00a05 hurricane less than a month prior.[2][24] As a result, relief workers cleaning up the resultant debris were also forced to evacuate.[21] Those evacuated were sent to Miami. Electricity was turned off in the Florida Keys as a precautionary measure. In Homestead, residents were advised to take shelter in a local school auditorium. The American Red Cross dispatched emergency equipment to the region, along with several other local relief agencies. Air traffic over southeastern Florida was suspended due to the proximity of the passing hurricane. Pan American World Airways cancelled all flights to and from Key West.

However, no damage of considerable extent was reported.[7] As the hurricane's extratropical remnants proceeded into Atlantic Canada, the storm produced rough seas and strong winds. The yacht Cumargo evacuated to the Halifax, Nova Scotia harbor to avoid rising waters. Off of Halifax, however, a man drowned after his ship capsized; this would be the only fatality recorded in Canada associated with the storm. In Newfoundland, where the extratropical storm made landfall, additional ships were damaged. In St. Mary's, four vessels were heavily damaged. The Portuguese schooner Rosita signaled a distress call off of Cape Race, but was later recovered. Similarly, the ship Madeline Hebb encountered the storm, but made it back to St. Anthony with no damage. Further inland, gusts peaked at 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) at Cape Race.

The eighth named storm of the season, Honorinina formed on 9 March to the south of Diego Garcia. It moved generally to the west-southwest due to a ridge to the south, gradually intensifying. On 12 March, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o France office in R\u00e9union (MFR) upgraded Honorinina to tropical cyclone status, which is the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. On the next day, the cyclone attained maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) while in the vicinity of Tromelin Island. Honorinina weakened subsequently before making landfall about 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Toamasina, Madagascar with winds of 135\u00a0km/h (84\u00a0mph). The storm weakened further over land, moving southwestward across the country. It emerged into the Mozambique Channel and became extratropical on 18 March. Honorinina then turned to the southeast, dissipating on 23 March. Early in its duration, the storm produced gusty winds along St. Brandon, and it later brought gusts of 158\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph) on Tromelin Island. However, effects were worst in Madagascar, especially in Toamasina near where the storm made landfall. Damage spread along 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) of the coastline and spread 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) inland from the landfall point, with many towns severely affected. In Toamasina, the cyclone damaged the main port, the airport, and several warehouses, resulting in $17\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD) of lost inventory. Thousands of houses were damaged, leaving 83,885\u00a0people homeless; a housing program earlier set up after Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 was extended to help storm victims after Honorinina.

By the next day, satellite imagery indicated that a tropical storm had formed about 635\u00a0km (395\u00a0mi) south of the island, given the name Honorinina.[1] On 9 March, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o France office in R\u00e9union (MFR)[nb 1] began tracking the storm in its database,[3] and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] began classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 25S.[5] The nascent tropical storm moved generally to the west-southwest, gradually intensifying.[1] On 11 March, the JTWC upgraded Honorinina to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane with 1\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[nb 3] On the next day, the MFR followed suit by upgrading the storm to tropical cyclone status while it was passing 175\u00a0km (109\u00a0mi) north of St. Brandon island.[3] After a trough passed eastward, a ridge developed south of Honorinina, which reinforced the southwest track toward Madagascar.[1] On 13 March, the MFR estimated the cyclone attained peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph), while the JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph).[3] The MFR also estimated the storm was producing gusts of 228\u00a0km/h (142\u00a0mph). While near peak intensity, Honorinina passed about 25\u00a0km (15\u00a0mph) south of Tromelin Island, and subsequently gradually weakened. On 15 March, the cyclone made landfall on eastern Madagascar about 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Toamasina.[1] Winds at landfall were estimated at 135\u00a0km/h (84\u00a0mph),[3] and a barometric pressure of 971.2\u00a0mbar (28.68\u00a0inHg) was reported at Toamasina.[1] It rapidly weakened to tropical depression status over land, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on 16 March.[5] The circulation continued southwestward through the island, emerging into the Mozambique Channel on the next day.[3] Thereafter, Honorinina restrengthened slightly over open waters. However, the MFR declared the storm as extratropical on 18 March, based on the satellite appearance.[1] The JTWC again issued advisories on the next day, only to discontinue them on 20 March.[5] Meanwhile, the MFR tracked the cyclone as turning to the south and southeast well south of Madagascar. On 22 March, Honorinina turned back to the south and dissipated the following day within the westerlies.[1][3]"

        "content": "Early in its duration, Honorinina passed near St. Brandon, where wind gusts reached 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph). Later, the storm produced wind gusts of 158\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph) on Tromelin Island. The barometric pressure there fell to 972\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg) during the storm's passage.[1] Before moving ashore mainland Madagascar, the cyclone brushed \u00cele Sainte-Marie with gusts of 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) while also dropping 270\u00a0mm (11\u00a0in) of rainfall over 24\u00a0hours. On mainland Madagascar, damage was heaviest at the port city of Toamasina, where winds also gusted to 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph),[1] and rainfall totaled 455.5\u00a0mm (17.93\u00a0in) over 24\u00a0hours. Heavy rainfall spread across the island, reaching 180.4\u00a0mm (7.10\u00a0in) at Morondava along the west coast.[1] Damage spread along 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) of the coastline and spread 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) inland from the landfall point, with many towns severely affected. Damage was heaviest in Toamasina, where the cyclone's winds struck for 30\u00a0hours. High waves broke off a 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft) section of the port jetty, leaving it susceptible to future storms. The tides also washed away shipping containers and flooded a coastal road. The damaged port warehouses resulted in the loss of 4000\u00a0tons of rice and 990\u00a0tons of stored cloves and cotton,[7] as well as 1,900\u00a0tons of coffee. Collectively, the lost stored product totaled around $17\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD).[8] Also in Toamasina, the cyclone damaged navigational systems, forcing the airport to close to all but light aircraft.[7] Outside of Toamasina, Honorinina damaged roads and rail lines connecting the city with the capital, Antananarivo. Several other roads were damaged by landslides or washouts, and many bridges were damaged. The high winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes along the storm's path, leaving 83,885\u00a0people homeless. Many of the damaged homes lost their roofs, which resulted in additional damage when the heavy rainfall affected their interiors. The high winds also damaged many public buildings and factories along its path.[7] The cyclone left widespread areas without water or power;[9] the storm damaged electrical transmission and generation facilities.[10] The high rainfall damaged dykes in Andromba and along the Ikopa and Sisaony rivers.[11] Across the country, Honorinina killed 99\u00a0people,[7] and caused 424\u00a0injuries.[12] Damage totaled about $150\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD).[13] On March\u00a020, the government of Madagascar appealed to the international community for assistance, due to the heavy damage from the cyclone. In response to the request, various governments and international organizations provided assistance to Madagascar, including $490,000 from the European Economic Community for food and blankets, as well as $125,000 from UNICEF for medicine and building supplies. Catholic Relief Services donated clothing, rice, and milk from Caritas Madagascar. Countries that provided assistance included China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, West Germany, Holy See, Mauritius, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden,[9] Soviet Union, and Switzerland. Collectively, the international community provided $3.37\u00a0million worth of aid to Madagascar. The United States Pacific Command flew from the Philippines to Madagascar to deliver medicine. The nation had earlier helped Madagascar recover from Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 with housing rebuilding projects, and transferred materials due to the impacts from Honorinina to the Toamasina area.[7] The Malagasy government also set up a National Relief Committee to facilitate relief efforts,[9] including an initial inspection of the affected area to determine needs. Workers delivered about 19\u00a0tons of material to Toamasina and nearby Brickaville, including milk, blankets, and clothing. The World Bank estimated the cost for repairing commercial areas would be over $27\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD).[7] The agency also allocated funds toward repairing damaged power facilities,[10] ports, roads, and airports.[8] The International Monetary Fund also approved a $37.8\u00a0million loan to the country in 1986, half of which for emergency aid.[14] Many houses and buildings had to be closed for repairs due to flood damage, including hotels, churches, and schools.[7]"

        "content": " The 1985\u201386 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was the first in which the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office (MFR) on R\u00e9union tracked cyclones as far east as 90\u00b0\u00a0E in Indian Ocean, south of the equator. Previously, the agency's area of responsibility was limited to 80\u00b0\u00a0E. It was an active season with twelve named storms, of which five strengthened into tropical cyclone with 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[nb 1] The first named storm was Tropical Storm Alifredy, which originated in the Mozambique Channel in late December and moved across Madagascar. However, the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) tracked a short-lived storm in September. Most of the activity occurred in 1986, with four storms in January, three of which briefly existed simultaneously on January\u00a010. The first of these three, Tropical Storm Berobia, struck eastern Mozambique. Tropical Storm Costa was a series of three tropical depressions within the same broader system that persisted for 12\u00a0days, bringing gusty winds and rainfall to the Mascarene Islands. The strongest storm of the season, Erinesta, formed in late January and struck the tiny Tromelin Island, decimating the native rabbit population. Erinesta later produced 1,643\u00a0mm (64.7\u00a0in) of rainfall in the mountainous peaks of R\u00e9union, one of the highest 24\u2011hour rainfall totals at the time at Cilaos. Two other storms in February \u2013 Filomena and Gista \u2013 moved southward for their durations and did not significantly impact land. In March, Cyclone Honorinina killed 99\u00a0people and caused $150\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD) in damage when it struck eastern Madagascar. There were two other storms in March, Iarima and Jefotra, the latter of which brushed Rodrigues island with gusty winds. The final two storms of the season, Krisostoma and Lila, entered from the Australian basin in April and May, respectively, with Lila exiting the basin to end the season on May\u00a010."

        "content": "During the season, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office (MFR) on R\u00e9union island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin. Using satellite imagery from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique, and warned on tropical cyclones in the region from the coast of Africa to 90\u00b0\u00a0E, south of the equator. In September 1985, their area of responsibility shifted from 80\u00b0\u00a0E to the current 90\u00b0\u00a0E, although lack of satellite imagery along the eastern periphery prevented complete coverage. The World Meteorological Organization would later label the MFR as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in 1993.[1] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy\u00a0\u2013 United States Air Force task force, also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the southwestern Indian Ocean.[2] The season's twelve\u00a0named storms was well above the average of nine, while the five tropical cyclones \u2013 storms attaining maximum sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) \u2013 was average.[3] The MFR considered the tropical cyclone year to begin on August\u00a01 and continue to July\u00a031 of the following year.[1] By December 1985, water temperatures were cooler than normal across the Indian Ocean.[4] However, the monsoon intensified the following month, allowing for increased tropical cyclogenesis.[5] There were no El Ni\u00f1o conditions by March.[6] In addition to the storms tracked by the MFR, the JTWC followed a short-lived tropical storm in September. Classified as Tropical Cyclone 01S, the storm developed on September\u00a023 to the east-southeast of Diego Garcia, which is an atoll in the central Indian Ocean. It failed to intensify beyond peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph), and after passing south of Diego Garcia, the storm dissipated on September\u00a029 south of the Seychelles.[2]"

The storm moved quickly southeastward toward Madagascar. High pressures to the south prevented much development, and Alifredy moved ashore near Morondava in western Madagascar on December\u00a024 at peak intensity. While crossing the island, the storm weakened into a tropical depression. Alifredy emerged into the open Indian Ocean and failed to restrengthen. It became extratropical and turned southeastward, dissipating on December\u00a027 within the westerlies.[7][8] The JTWC did not track the storm.[2] Alifredy had little impacts on Madagascar; Morombe reported a peak wind gust of 56\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph).[7]"

        "content": "The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) spawned a tropical depression in the northern periphery of the Mozambique Channel on January\u00a05, near the Comoros. Initially still located with the ITCZ, the system tracked south-southwestward, although its motion slowed due to a ridge to the south. It passed near Juan de Nova Island on January\u00a06, producing gusts of 81\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph). By January\u00a07, the system began disassociating itself from the ITCZ and it intensified. That night, the Madagascar Meteorological Service named the depression Berobia,[9] which intensified into a moderate tropical storm the next day.[10] Also on January\u00a08, the JTWC began classifying the storm as Tropical Cyclone 06S.[2] That day, Berobia began moving to the west-northwest, due to the strengthening ridge to the south.[9] On January\u00a09, the storm attained peak winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) according to the MFR; the JTWC estimated a slightly higher 1\u00a0minute peak of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[10] Late on January\u00a09, Berobia made landfall about 125\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) north of Beira, Mozambique, and it dissipated the next day after entering Zimbabwe.[9][10] The remnants of Berobia dropped heavy rainfall in northeastern Zimbabwe, with a 24\u2011hour peak of 179\u00a0mm (7.0\u00a0in).[11]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Costa was a series of three different tropical depressions within the same broader system that persisted for 12\u00a0days east of Madagascar, all given the same name. The first circulation formed on January\u00a07 between the northeast coast of Madagascar and Agal\u00e9ga. Later that day, the Madagascar Meteorological Service named it Costa,[12] and the JTWC labeled it Tropical Cyclone 05S.[2] It moved eastward and later turned to the southeast, passing near Agal\u00e9ga before weakening while moving into the ITCZ. Another circulation formed to the east of Costa, and the original circulation dissipated on January\u00a09. The new center moved to the west-southwest toward St. Brandon, although it was disorganized, dissipating on January\u00a011. A third circulation formed on the previous day to the east, becoming a tropical depression with well-organized rainbands. This third system would last the longest, originally moving to the northeast before curving southeastward.[12] On January\u00a012, Costa intensified into a moderate tropical storm. On the next day, the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and the MFR estimated peak winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). Costa weakened briefly on January\u00a014 while passing about 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) east of Rodrigues, although it re-attained its former peak on the next day while accelerating southeastward. Costa thereafter weakened rapidly and moved erratically toward the southwest. By January\u00a015, it deteriorated into a minimal tropical storm, and meandered for several days. On January\u00a019, Costa dissipated within the flow of the westerlies.[12][13] When Costa formed, it passed near Agal\u00e9ga, producing wind gusts of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). The storm approached St. Brandon twice; on its first passage, Costa produced gusts of 91\u00a0km/h (57\u00a0mph) during a strong rainband. Later, the storm dropped 64\u00a0mm (2.5\u00a0in) of rainfall on Rodrigues while producing gusts of 107\u00a0km/h (66\u00a0mph).[12]"

The system had a curved area of convection, and organized enough for MFR to designate it Tropical Storm Delifina on January\u00a010.[14] On the same day, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane.[15] The storm moved generally southward, after an initial westward movement. Delifina gradually intensified, becoming a tropical cyclone on January\u00a013. By that time, the storm had an eye in the center of deep organized convection. The MFR estimated peak winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), while the JTWC estimated 1\u00a0minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph). Subsequently, Delifina weakened as it progressed southward. After turning to the southeast, the deteriorating storm turned sharply northwestward between two ridges. Delifina turned back to the east and dissipated on January\u00a019 at nearly the same longitude where it formed.[14][15]"

It moved westward and slowly organized,[16] becoming a moderate tropical storm on January\u00a031.[17] On the same day, the JTWC classified the storm as Tropical Cyclone 13S,[2] and the Mauritius Meteorological Service named it Erinesta. Its track shifted to a slow west-southwest trajectory while intensifying.[16] The JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on February\u00a01, and the MFR upgraded Erinesta to tropical cyclone status on the next day.[17] On February\u00a04, the cyclone attained peak winds, becoming one of the strongest storms in the basin in several decades.[16] The JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), and the MFR estimated peak winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[17] Shortly after Erinesta reached peak intensity, it passed within 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) of Tromelin Island. The storm curved southward due to an approaching trough, briefly threatening to strike R\u00e9union. However, a ridge built behind the trough, bringing the storm between the east coast of Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. Erinesta gradually weakened, passing west of R\u00e9union as a severe tropical storm on February\u00a07. The storm accelerated to the south-southeast and later became extratropical, dissipating on February\u00a011 within the westerlies.[16][17] Passing near Tromelin at peak intensity, Erinesta produced peak wind gusts of 234\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) before damaging the anemometer, with peak winds estimated as high as 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph). The high winds damaged every building and scientific instrument on the island.[16] The passage of the storm killed Tromelin's entire rabbit population.[18] Along the east coast of Madagascar, Erinesta produced 83\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph) wind gusts and 24\u2011hour rainfall of 64.8\u00a0mm (2.55\u00a0in) at Toamasina. Lastly, the cyclone passed west of R\u00e9union, where ten days of precipitation accumulated to 1,643\u00a0mm (64.7\u00a0in) at Cilaos, of which 1,017\u00a0mm (40.0\u00a0in) fell over 24\u00a0hours.[16] The 24\u2011hour total there was among the highest on record, surpassing even Cyclone Hyacinthe, the wettest storm on record. In one hour, Erinesta dropped 70\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in) of rainfall, which only occurs every two and a half years. This helped replenish aquifer levels, after two years of drought conditions.[19] The rains caused 1 in 10 year flooding in portions of the island, reaching 30\u00a0m3/s (1,060\u00a0ft3/s) at Ravine Blanche.[20] While moving past the island, Erinesta produced peak gusts of 139\u00a0km/h (86\u00a0mph) in the mountainous interior at Plaine des Cafres.[16] The cyclone also produced very high waves along coastal roads, closing them for four days and damaging guard rails.[21]"

That day, it developed into Moderate Tropical Storm Gista,[24][25] Early on February\u00a019, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 19S.[2] Gista moved generally southward, initially moving to the southeast toward western Madagascar and later curving to the southwest, bringing it within 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) of the coast. The storm gradually intensified while moving away from the country, reaching peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) on January\u00a021 about 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) east of Europa Island. According to the MFR, Gista became extratropical that night, although the JTWC continued tracking it for several more days. According to the JTWC, Gista intensified to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on February\u00a022 to the southwest of Madagascar, and the next day reached peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph). Gista accelerated to the southeast and dissipated late on February\u00a024 in the westerlies.[24][25] While Gista was moving along the west coast of Madagascar, it produced peak wind gusts of 82\u00a0km/h (51\u00a0mph) at Maintirano. It later produced wind gusts of 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) on Europa Island.[24]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Honorinina formed on March\u00a09 to the south of Diego Garcia. It moved generally to the west-southwest due to a ridge to the south, gradually intensifying. On March\u00a012, the MFR upgraded Honorinina to tropical cyclone status, which is the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. On the next day, the cyclone attained maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) while in the vicinity of Tromelin Island, although the JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph). Honorinina weakened subsequently before making landfall about 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Toamasina, Madagascar with winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). The storm weakened further over land, moving southwestward across the country. It emerged into the Mozambique Channel and became extratropical on March\u00a018. Honorinina turned to the southeast, dissipating on March\u00a023.[26][27] Early in its duration, the storm produced gusty winds along St. Brandon, and it later brought gusts of 158\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph) on Tromelin Island.[26] However, effects were worst in Madagascar, especially in Toamasina near where the storm made landfall. Damage spread along 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) of the coastline and reached 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) inland from the landfall point, with many towns severely affected. In Toamasina, the cyclone damaged the main port, the airport, and several warehouses, resulting in $17\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD) of lost inventory.[28][29] Thousands of houses were damaged, leaving 83,885\u00a0people homeless; a housing program earlier set up after Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 was extended to help storm victims after Honorinina.[28] Nationwide, the cyclone killed 99\u00a0people and caused $150\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD) in damage.[28][30]"

The eighth named storm and third typhoon of the 1974 Pacific typhoon season, the system was first noted by the China Meteorological Agency as an area of convection embedded on a trough, to the north of Enewetak Atoll on June 25. It was named Gilda on June 30 as it strengthened to a tropical storm. Under a favorable environment, it strengthened to a typhoon two days later as it moved northwestward. Another trough pulled Gilda poleward while changing less in intensity, until it intensified to a Category 2 typhoon as it battered the Ryukyu Islands at its peak. Increasing wind shear gradually weakened the system; however, it remained as a minimal typhoon until it passed through the southern tip of South Korea on July 6, where it weakened to a tropical storm. Colder waters in the Sea of Japan and high shear further degraded Gilda, until it transitioned to an extratropical low as it made landfall near Hokkaido on July 9. The remnants of the system briefly intensified near the Kuril Islands before weakening and dissipating on July 17 over the Sea of Okhotsk. Gilda was responsible for over 145 fatalities and a missing person as it affected South Korea and the Japanese archipelago, including the Nansei Islands. Widespread flooding and landslides also occurred, which was more worsened by an active frontal system over Shanghai. The total damages from the system were at $1.5 billion (1974 USD)."

The disturbance moved to the west without further development, based on satellite imagery.[1] On June 29, the system became better defined on satellite coverages, with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issuing their first bulletin on the system at 00:00 UTC that day.[3] Based on a ship that reported gale-force winds near its center, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm at this time, with the agency naming it Gilda.[3] The JMA, at that time, analysed the barometric pressure of the system to be 990 mBar.[2] Gilda then began to curve northwards, as a mid-atmospheric trough began to be dominant over East China.[3] At 06:00 UTC of July 2, the system intensified to a typhoon, with its barometric pressure analyzed by the JMA to be 965 mBar.[2][3] Early the next day, a Japanese vessel named Shinkyoyu Maru passed near the typhoon, recording a pressure of 988 mBar and winds of over 45 knots.[3] Gilda slowly intensified despite a favorable environment and while passing through the Ryukyu Islands, it strengthened to a Category 2 typhoon on July 4 and reached its peak intensity shortly, with one-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 945 mBar, equivalent to a mid-level typhoon.[2][3] On the same day, a reconnaissance aircraft passed through its eye, measuring a minimum pressure of 944 mBar.[3] Shortly after peaking, the typhoon slowly weakened to a Category 1 due to increasing wind shear and unfavorable sea surface temperatures on the next day.[3] A mid-atmospheric subtropical ridge curved the system to the north-northeast and while nearing South Korea, Gilda weakened to a tropical storm and accelerated, due to an upper-level southwesterly flow over Manchuria.[3][2] As it entered the Sea of Japan, the disorganized Gilda started to become extratropical while weakening to a tropical depression on July 7.[3][2] In post-tropical analysis, Gilda remained a tropical depression as it made landfall through Hokkaido on the next day before becoming fully extratropical as it moved offshore in the Pacific Ocean on July 9.[2][3][4] The extratropical remnants of Gilda briefly strengthened while nearing the Kuril Islands and it started to undergo a loop before entering the Sea of Okhotsk.[2] There, it weakened below gale-force and dissipated on July 17, ending its long journey.[2]"

An unstable atmosphere, characterized by mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values of 1,500\u20132,500\u00a0J/kg, strong wind shear, and very steep mid-level lapse rates of 8.5\u20139\u00a0C/km,[5] led to the formation of discrete supercell thunderstorms along a stationary front across the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, as well as southern Kansas. Sporadic large hail and landspout tornado reports were received before the storms congealed into a line,[6] transitioning the main severe threat to damaging wind gusts.[7] Less concentrated activity occurred throughout the region, including a thunderstorm that produced five consecutive minutes of winds above 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h), and a peak gust of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h), in Denton, Texas.[8]"

Several strong tornadoes touched down within this corridor, where mid-level CAPE reached 1,000\u00a0J/kg and low-level wind shear profiles became conducive for tornadoes.[21] Overall, 12 tornadoes touched down in North Carolina, the state's sixth largest outbreak on record in a single day.[22] Meanwhile, 16 tornadoes were confirmed in Virginia, the state's third largest outbreak in a 24-hour period, surpassed only by the Hurricane Ivan tornado outbreak and the 1993 Virginia tornado outbreak.[23] Into the evening, a loss of daytime heating led to a diminishing of the severe weather potential as thunderstorms shifted eastward into the Atlantic Ocean.[24]"

        "content": " Typhoon Zeb, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Iliang, was a powerful typhoon that struck the island of Luzon in October 1998. It is tied with Cyclone Ron and Cyclone Susan in terms of minimum pressure, for the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide for 1998. The tenth tropical storm of the season, Zeb formed on October\u00a010 from the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands. It moved westward initially and quickly intensified. Zeb's inflow briefly spawned another tropical storm, which it ultimately absorbed. Developing an eye, Zeb rapidly intensified into a super typhoon, officially reaching maximum sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph); one warning agency estimated winds as high as 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph). After reaching peak intensity, the typhoon struck northern Luzon and quickly weakened over land. Turning to the north, Zeb brushed the east coast of Taiwan at a reduced intensity, and after accelerating to the northeast it moved through Japan. It became extratropical on October\u00a018 and moved eastward over open waters. First affecting the Philippines, Zeb dropped torrential rainfall in Luzon, reaching 1,116 millimetres (43.9 inches) in one day in La Trinidad, estimated as a one-in-1,147-year event. The rains caused floods and landslides, which compounded with high winds to leave heavy crop damage. Zeb destroyed or damaged 85,844\u00a0houses in the Philippines, and damage in the country was estimated at \u20b15.375\u00a0billion (1998 Philippine pesos, $126\u00a0million U.S. dollars), the fifth-costliest at the time. There were also 83\u00a0deaths in the country, a number compounded upon when Typhoon Babs struck the same region a week later. High winds and rainfall from Zeb later affected Taiwan, causing NT$4.15\u00a0billion (New Taiwan dollar, $125\u00a0million USD) in damage as well as 31\u00a0deaths. Gusty winds affected much of Japan, while heavy rainfall peaked at 586\u00a0mm (23.1\u00a0in) on Mount Ontake. The storm killed 14\u00a0people in the country, several related to landslides. Zeb destroyed 770\u00a0homes and flooded another 12,548 in Japan."

        "content": "The monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance over the western Pacific Ocean to the east of Guam around October\u00a07. The system moved steadily westward, organizing enough for the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early on October\u00a09. After the disturbance passed south of Guam, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 18W late on October\u00a09,[1] and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit the next day.[2] While passing north of Yap in the Caroline Islands, the depression intensified into a tropical storm according to the JTWC, which gave it the name Zeb.[1] The JMA again was delayed in upgrading by a day.[2] After becoming a tropical storm, Zeb proceeded to steadily intensify. Its large inflow spawned a circulation well to the east-northeast, which organized into a separate tropical storm \u2013 Alex.[1] Early on October\u00a011, the storm entered the area of responsibility of PAGASA \u2013 the Philippine-based weather agency \u2013 which gave it the local name Iliang.[3]  Late on October\u00a011, the JTWC upgraded Zeb to typhoon status, or one-minute winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[1] This was based on the appearance of a banding-type eye on satellite imagery.[4] On October\u00a012, the storm rapidly intensified as it turned more to the west-northwest toward the Philippines. During this time, it caused increased wind shear over the smaller Tropical Storm Alex to the east-northeast, ultimately absorbing it. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a013, the JTWC upgraded Zeb to super typhoon status, estimating winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), marking that Zeb attained Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Twelve hours later, the agency estimated that the typhoon strengthened further to a peak of 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph), making it the strongest storm of the season.[1] At the same time, PAGASA also estimated peak 10-minute winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), also designating Zeb as a super typhoon.[5] Late on October\u00a013, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) just east of the island of Luzon.[2] While near peak intensity, the JTWC estimated that winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) extended 95 kilometres (59 miles), and gales extended 465\u00a0km (289\u00a0mi) from the center.[4] Zeb's eyewall continued to contract up until it moved ashore.[6] Early on October\u00a014, Zeb made landfall on eastern Luzon just south of Palanan Bay, or east of Ilagan, near peak intensity. The typhoon weakened rapidly over land, while its track shifted more to the north around a ridge to the east.[1][4] It emerged into the Luzon Strait between the eponymous island and Taiwan with a much larger eyewall,[6] and failed to re-intensify over open waters. Late on October\u00a015, Zeb passed within 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) of Taiwan's east coast before accelerating to the northeast due to a passing trough.[1][4] The JMA downgraded the typhoon to tropical storm status on October\u00a016,[2] although the JTWC retained Zeb at typhoon status.[1] Favorable upper-level conditions allowed the storm to briefly re-intensify after passing Taiwan, although this was short-lived, and it weakened while accelerating toward Japan.[4] At 07:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a017, Zeb struck southern Kyushu in Kagoshima Prefecture. It continued northeastward through the country, striking K\u014dchi Prefecture on Shikoku and later crossing central Honshu as a tropical storm.[2] During this time, the storm was losing tropical characteristics as it swiftly entered the Sea of Japan.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a018, the JMA declared Zeb extratropical, and shortly after the storm moved over northern Hokkaido and into the Sea of Okhotsk. The remnants moved across the southern Kamchatka Peninsula and continued eastward through the open north Pacific. It was last noted by the JMA early on October\u00a020.[2]"

Lesser warnings were issued as far south as the Visayas,[7] and extended into the Metro Manila area.[8] After two damaging storms in September, the government began making widespread preparations on October\u00a013, organizing efforts through its National Disaster Coordinating Council.[9] Ports were closed and flights were canceled due to the storm.[10] Before the worst of the storm struck, power companies shut off electricity to prevent accidents.[11] About 103,000\u00a0people evacuated their homes,[12] including over 6,325 staying in 114\u00a0government shelters.[13] Evacuations extended as far south as Camarines Sur.[8] The Hong Kong Observatory issued a stand-by warning signal #1 due to the storm's proximity to the South China Sea.[14] Before Zeb brushed the east coast of Taiwan, a typhoon warning was issued, causing schools, government buildings, and financial markets to close. Airports and ferry travel were also disrupted.[15] 183\u00a0residents evacuated to storm shelters, including 50 from a nursing home.[16] Hundreds of Chinese fishing boats rode out the storm in Taiwan harbors.[17] Similarly to Taiwan, Zeb delayed ferry service in Japan,[15] and caused 271\u00a0domestic flights to be canceled.[18] Train service was canceled on Kyushu during the storm.[19]"

In the municipality of Bakun, the 1,000-millimetre (39-inch) rain gauge overflowed, and in nearby La Trinidad, the rainfall was 1,116\u00a0mm (43.9\u00a0in) on October\u00a014 alone. The latter total was estimated as a one-in-1,147-year event, based on the history of local rainfall totals.[21] In the city of Baguio, the precipitation reached 994.6\u00a0mm (39.16\u00a0in), enough to flood the town 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) deep.[4] The Binga and Ambuclao dams in Benguet were unable to support the rains from the storm, forcing them to be opened and flood three towns in neighboring Pangasinan.[22] Minor street flooding occurred along the west coast near Manila.[23] Across Luzon, the high rains caused flooding, landslides, and halted construction of a dam in Bakun.[21] Considered one of the strongest typhoons to hit the area in decades, Zeb knocked down trees and power lines, which covered roads and left areas isolated. The winds were strong enough to blow over a jeepney.[8] Along its path, the storm destroyed 26,305\u00a0houses and damaged another 59,539,[20] mostly affecting those of weaker building materials.[24] River flooding caused heavy damage to crops,[22] estimated at \u20b11.76\u00a0billion (1998 Philippine pesos, $41.3\u00a0million U.S. dollars);[20] the storm destroyed 181,630\u00a0t (400,430,000\u00a0lb) of rice in Ilocos Region and Cagayan Valley.[4] Most of the damage occurred in Luzon, with little impact elsewhere.[25] The storm also marred the local infrastructure; areas in northeastern Luzon were isolated when landslides blocked a highway,[22] and several other roads and bridges were impassible.[13] Overall, Zeb killed 83\u00a0people in the country,[26] while injuring another 63;[20] most of the deaths were related to the landslides,[12] and 33 of the deaths were in Cordillera Administrative Region.[22] Overall damage was estimated at \u20b15.375\u00a0billion (PHP, $126\u00a0million USD),[20] which as of 2011 was the thirteenth-costliest typhoon in the Philippines and the fifth-costliest at the time.[27]"

High tides were also recorded, although there was no reported damage in the territory.[14] Later, Zeb produced sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) in Taiwan, although gusts topped at 191\u00a0km/h (119\u00a0mph).[25] The typhoon dropped torrential rainfall in the northern and eastern portions of the island, with peak hourly rates of 42.1\u00a0mm (1.66\u00a0in). Several regions of Taiwan received over 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) of rainfall. The rains caused severe flooding along rivers, with a peak discharge of 3715\u00a0m\u00b3/s (131,193\u00a0ft\u00b3/s).[28] The high rainfall forced workers at the Fei-tsui Dam to release water, after water levels rose by 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in).[29] Landslides near Taipei wrecked homes, trapping at least two people.[15] Landslides also covered several highways while floods washed away bridges, cutting off traffic.[12][16] Flooding occurred in the suburbs of Taipei, and the winds were strong enough to cause skyscrapers to sway in the city.[30] Zeb's winds knocked over trees, billboards, and power lines,[12] leaving 1.15\u00a0million without electricity.[14] Two-story high waves killed a fisherman in Taitung City,[31] washed a freighter ashore in Taichung,[17] and capsized a boat in Tamsui District, killing one sailor; five of the others on board swam two hours to reach shore.[19] The storm left $57.6\u00a0million (USD) in crop damage,[15] after hundreds of acres of fields were damaged in the southern and central Taiwan.[17] Overall damage was estimated at NT$4.15\u00a0billion (New Taiwan dollar, $125\u00a0million USD), and there were 31\u00a0confirmed deaths in Taiwan, with 19\u00a0people injured.[14] While moving through Japan, Zeb produced peak sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) in K\u014dchi Prefecture within Shikoku. The highest rainfall was 586\u00a0mm (23.1\u00a0in) on Mount Ontake on Honshu.[32] The widespread rainfall caused 332\u00a0landslides and washed away seven bridges.[33] Within Japan, Zeb first affected Miyako-jima while passing about 180\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) to the northwest. High winds left 2,600\u00a0houses without power and caused damage to public buildings.[34] It later passed about 230\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) to the northwest of Okinawa. Along the island, wind gusts reached 134\u00a0km/h (83\u00a0mph), and wave heights peaked at 13.7\u00a0m (45\u00a0ft).[35] The waves swept away two people over a sea wall,[15] killing them both. High waves also damaged a port at Kadena Air Base as well as several houses near the coast.[35] The storm also passed near the Yaeyama Islands with strong winds. Salt spray coated trees and ruined them, and there was scattered public building damage.[36] On Kyushu, Zeb damaged houses,[37] marred crops, and flooded rivers. The storm spawned a tornado in Miyazaki Prefecture that damaged two roofs and a vehicle.[38] In Saganoseki, a motorist died after a roadway collapse landed his vehicle in a nearby river.[39] On Shikoku, Zeb destroyed roads and farmlands and eroded lands along waterways.[40] Three people died due to a landslide in Matsuyama.[41] In Okayama Prefecture along Honshu, Zeb left six people missing or killed and was the costliest typhoon since Typhoon Fran in 1976.[42] Landslides killed three people in Hiroshima Prefecture.[43] Power outages and landslides affected much of Honshu, while strong winds damaged many fields.[44] A cargo freighter washed aground amid high waves in Shizuoka Prefecture, causing oil to leak and requiring assistance from the Coast Guard; oil recovery equipment was sent to the area to clean the spill.[45] Lastly, Zeb affected the northern island of Hokkaido, causing one landslide, damaging 152\u00a0buildings, and knocking 152,000\u00a0apples to the ground.[46] Nationwide, Zeb destroyed 770\u00a0homes and flooded another 12,548,[32] with thousands forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding.[15] Overall, there were 14\u00a0deaths and 67\u00a0injuries,[32] with damage estimated at $335.5\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD).[47]"

They were aided by the Philippine Red Cross and other government agencies.[13] Most evacuees returned home after the storm passed, excluding those whose houses sustained damage.[49] Volunteers, the military, and public workers helped clean up from the damage.[26] Just seven days after Zeb's damaging Philippine landfall, another typhoon\u2014Babs\u2014struck the same general region with a similar, but lesser intensity.[1] After both storms, the Philippine National Electrification Administration provided \u20b11.78\u00a0million to the Batanes Electric Cooperative to restore damaged power lines.[50] Power was gradually restored in northeastern Luzon, allowing communication of the damage extent.[22] The nation's Department of Health distributed \u20b1547,469 worth of medicine to four provinces.[13] The government airlifted about 3,000\u00a0bags of supplies to Cagayan that included rice and canned goods.[48] The back to back storm impacts caused an estimated 30% drop in coconut exports.[51] Food prices rose dramatically, in some instances up to 400%, after both storms damaged crops.[52] The storms also delayed shipments of sugar from neighboring countries, although prices were expected to fall once they arrived.[53] By December 1998, consumer prices had risen by 11.2% over the previous year due to the typhoons' damage.[54] Workers in Taiwan began a search-and-rescue mission for missing victims once the typhoon warning was lifted.[15] Workers immediately began repairing road damage in Japan once the storm passed.[33]"

The seventh typhoon of the inactive 1998 Pacific typhoon season, Babs formed on October\u00a014 between the Philippines and Guam. The storm moved westward initially, failing to intensify initially due to the outflow from Typhoon Zeb to the northwest. Babs slowed and briefly turned to the south before advancing to the northwest, whereupon it rapidly intensified into a strong typhoon. On October\u00a020, the official Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated peak 10\u2011minute winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), while the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1\u2011minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), making Babs an unofficial super typhoon. The storm struck the Philippine island of Catanduanes at that intensity and weakened slightly before hitting Luzon. Babs turned northward once in the South China Sea, later weakening due to unfavorable conditions and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a027 in the Taiwan Strait. Damage was heaviest where Babs first made landfall along the Philippine island of Catanduanes. Torrential rainfall rose waters by 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) along a river, which inundated houses up to their roofs. Heavy rainfall affected much of Luzon and the northern Philippines, causing widespread flooding and landslides that isolated towns. Strong winds, peaking at 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) in Virac, Catanduanes, left widespread areas without power. There was also heavy crop damage, with 222,882\u00a0tonnes of rice destroyed. Babs damaged or destroyed 403,623\u00a0houses in the Philippines, with overall damage estimated at \u20b16.787\u00a0billion (Philippine peso, $159\u00a0million United States dollars); the typhoon also killed 303\u00a0people. Later, the storm's high waves injured surfers in Hong Kong. Heavy rainfall affected Fujian, causing \u00a5280\u00a0million (Chinese yuan, US$58\u00a0million) in damage and five deaths. Torrential rainfall in Taiwan, reaching 1,306\u00a0mm (51.4\u00a0in) in Yilan City, flooded towns and caused landslides; there were three deaths on the island. The remnants later affected the Japanese island of Okinawa with rainfall and high waves."

        "content": "A tropical disturbance developed east-southeast of Guam on October\u00a011, just four days after Typhoon Zeb originated in the same area. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on October\u00a012, indicating development was imminent.[1] However, the system did not develop into a tropical depression until 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a014, based on analysis from the Japan Meteorological Agency \u2013 the official warning center for the western Pacific Ocean.[2] Three hours later, the JTWC began tracking the system as Tropical Depression 20W.[1] At that time, the storm had moved south of Guam and was passing north of Palau.[3] The nascent depression moved generally westward toward the Philippines. Initially, development was hindered by the outflow from Typhoon Zeb, which had struck Luzon and was moving northward.[3] However, the depression was able to intensify into a tropical storm on October\u00a015, at which time the JTWC named it Babs. Later that day, the storm reached 1\u2011minute winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph),[1] and it entered the area of responsibility of PAGASA \u2013 the Philippine weather agency \u2013 which gave it the local name Loleng.[4] On October\u00a017, a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast weakened the subtropical ridge, causing Babs to slow and drift to the south; the same trough restricted outflow,[1] causing the circulation to become exposed from the convection.[3] The trough weakened and the shear decreased on October\u00a018, allowing the storm to restrengthen.[1][3] On October\u00a019, a ship in the proximity of Babs reported 10\u2011minute winds of 96\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph), indicating that the storm was intensifying.[3] At 00:00\u00a0UTC that day, the JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status,[1] and the JMA followed suit 18\u00a0hours later.[2] Babs rapidly intensified subsequently as it developed a well-defined eye 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) in diameter.[3] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a020, the JMA assessed that the typhoon reached peak 10\u2011minute winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph),[2] while the JTWC estimated peak 1\u2011minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), making Babs an unofficial super typhoon.[1] The gale-force winds extended 335\u00a0km (208\u00a0mi) northeast from the center, while the strongest winds extended 75\u00a0km (47\u00a0mi) from the eye. Around the time of peak intensity, Babs made landfall on the Philippine island of Catanduanes, where a weather station recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 928\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg) in Virac.[3] However, the official lowest pressure from the JMA was 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[2] The winds decreased slightly as Babs moved across Catanduanes, although it soon moved over open waters into Lamon Bay, where it struck Polillo Island. According to the JTWC, Babs had weakened to winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on October\u00a022 before quickly re-intensifying to winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) as it approached Luzon. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a022, Babs made landfall on Luzon about 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) south of Baler, or 185\u00a0km (115\u00a0mi) south of where Zeb struck only eight days prior. The typhoon weakened further while crossing central Luzon, and it passed about 75\u00a0km (47\u00a0mi) north of Metro Manila before emerging into the South China Sea on October\u00a023.[1][3] By that time, the JMA had downgraded Babs to a tropical storm, although the agency soon re-upgraded the storm to typhoon status.[2] For several days, Babs remained at the same intensity, sporting an eye with a wide area of gale-force winds. A trough gradually steered the storm toward the north, weakening the ridge.[3] The same trough caused an increase in wind shear that led to Babs weakening.[1] The storm reached its westernmost point on October\u00a025 \u2013 about 275\u00a0km (171\u00a0mi) southeast of Hong Kong. Turning northeastward into the Taiwan Strait, even stronger wind shear caused Babs to fall apart, and the storm weakened into a tropical depression just off the southeast coast of China.[1] On October\u00a027, the JMA declared Babs as extratropical. The remnants accelerated to the northeast, passing south of Kyushu before dissipating on October\u00a030.[2]"

Bus service to the region was also halted.[10] The stock and currency exchanges were closed during the storm.[11] Officials advised residents in Metro Manila to remain indoors; government buildings and schools were closed, while Ninoy Aquino International Airport halted all domestic flights.[10] In addition, 14\u00a0international flights were canceled.[12] Manila South Harbor also kept all boats at port.[10] Across the Philippines, Babs forced about 400,000\u00a0people to leave their houses.[1] Many families waited to evacuate until the onslaught of the strongest winds, resulting in additional casualties.[3] The Hong Kong Observatory issued a warning signal #3 due to the storm's threat to the territory on October\u00a024.[13] Beaches closed during the storms, and fishing boats were forced to remain at port.[1] Several airports in Taiwan were closed.[14] Two Russian ships were forced to ride out the storm in Xiamen.[15]"

In Daet, Camarines Norte, near the typhoon's final Philippine landfall, sustained winds reached 129\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph), with gusts to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). Farther north in Luzon, Babs produced gusts of 192\u00a0km/h (119\u00a0mph) in Baler, Aurora.[3] The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall that caused flooding and landslides.[13] On Mount Pinatubo, the rains resulted in a 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft) high landslide consisting of volcanic material, although nearby rivers at flood stage contained it.[3] Workers at the Ambuklao and Binga dams had to release waters after the storm, which flooded rice fields and fish ponds along the Agno River.[16] Elsewhere, heightened rivers in Camarines Sur flooded 24\u00a0towns.[17] Five towns in Rizal province were flooded along a lake, including about 70% of the city of Angono.[18] Flooding also affected portions of Manila.[19] Just like Typhoon Zeb days earlier, Babs was very destructive to the Philippines,[3] mostly throughout Luzon and into the Visayas.[20] On Catanduanes where it first struck, several hours of torrential rainfall in the hills caused the Bato River to rise 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft), which reached as high as the houses' roofs in some areas. Most houses lost their roofs and many had damage to walls, with furniture and other property drenched.[21] About 80% of the buildings in the city of Virac were destroyed, and winds were strong enough to knock air conditioners out of windows.[22] There was an island-wide power outage after high seas washed away a power generating barge.[23] On Masbate, a landslide collapsed the entrance of a gold mining cave, with 14 of the 25\u00a0member crew rescued.[24] High waves destroyed 125\u00a0homes in Catbalogan on Samar Island, while three fishermen required rescue.[17] Along its path through the Philippines, the high winds caused widespread power outages for several days.[9] Many roads and highways were flooded for days or blocked by landslides, and several bridges were wrecked.[16] In the Bicol Region of southern Luzon, the storm knocked over many coconut trees,[3] and flooding damaged about 88,000\u00a0ha (220,000 acres) of rice fields in Nueva Ecija.[16] Nationwide, the storm destroyed 222,882\u00a0tonnes of rice.[25] Agriculture damage was estimated at \u20b12.3\u00a0billion (Philippine pesos, $54\u00a0million United States dollars).[20] Overall, Babs destroyed 96,581\u00a0houses and damaged another 307,042,[20] leaving about 130,000\u00a0people homeless.[13] There were 303\u00a0deaths in the country with another 751 injured,[20] mostly in the Bicol Region. This included 71 deaths on Catanduanes and 41 in Camarines Sur. Most of the deaths were related to landslides, flooding, electrocutions, snakebites, and cleanup accidents.[3] On Catanduanes, residents dug mass graves due to the high number of fatalities.[26] Total damage was estimated at \u20b16.787\u00a0billion (PHP, US$159\u00a0million),[20] which as of 2011 was the 9th costliest typhoon in the Philippines and the 5th costliest at the time.[27]"

The mountainous peak of Tate's Cairn recorded the highest sustained wind of 87\u00a0km/h (54\u00a0mph). The winds were strong enough to knock down trees and damage scaffolding.[13] Beaches were closed during the storm's passage, and boats rode out the storm at port.[28] Precipitation from the typhoon fell over three days, reaching 85\u00a0mm (3.3\u00a0in). Five surfers required rescues amid high seas, with a peak storm surge of 0.91\u00a0m (3.0\u00a0ft). There were 14\u00a0injuries related to Babs in the territory.[13] The dissipating remnants of Babs interacted with the winter monsoon to drop heavy rainfall on Taiwan, particularly in the northern and eastern portions of the island. Yilan City recorded 1,306\u00a0mm (51.4\u00a0in) over three days, and Hualien City recorded 949\u00a0mm (37.4\u00a0in).[29] One station recorded 508\u00a0mm (20.0\u00a0in) of rainfall in 24\u00a0hours. This led to flooding in eastern Taiwan, reaching waist-deep heights in some locations,[1] which forced hundreds to leave their home.[14] The rains also caused landslides that isolated villages,[1] and a swollen Keelung River cut off two towns east of Taipei.[30] The storm killed three people on the island,[3] including a fishermen swept away by high waves,[14] and a couple buried under a landslide.[31] Across the Taiwan Strait, Babs killed five people and injured three others in the Chinese province of Fujian.[3] In Zhangzhou, the storm damaged or destroyed 124\u00a0boats.[32] Heavy rainfall destroyed 1,461\u00a0homes or greenhouses, with damage estimated at \u00a5280\u00a0million (Chinese yuan, US$58\u00a0million).[33] Damage was concentrated in Fujian, with little effects reported in neighboring Jiangxi or Guangdong.[32] The remnants also brought rainfall to southern Japan, including Okinawa, where precipitation reached 172\u00a0mm (6.8\u00a0in) in Yonagunijima. The same station recorded winds of 43\u00a0km/h (27\u00a0mph).[34] High waves flooded a portion of Route 58 on Okinawa, damaging three vehicles and flooding 28\u00a0buildings.

The president ordered agencies to work together to respond to the disaster and for his Trade Secretary to watch for price gouging.[36] However, food prices tripled following Babs and Zeb, especially after roads were blocked from agriculture areas, and ferries from unaffected areas were unable to travel due to the storm.[16] After Babs passed the hardest hit areas, workers were initially unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted.[9] Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers.[24] The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads.[17] The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000\u00a0sacks of rice to storm victims,[37] and the country planned to import 300,000\u00a0tonnes of rice to overcome the lost crops.[25] The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and rescue teams, as well as distributing food and coffee to 35,500\u00a0people.[38] The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement launched a global request for assistance worth about $2.2\u00a0million to help 240,000\u00a0people.[39]"

Damage was estimated at $25.9\u00a0million, with $6.82\u00a0million from crops, $15.9\u00a0million from public infrastructure, and $3.37 million from private infrastructure. The typhoon tracked westward before tracking west-southwest, only to decelerate to the west-northwest. Increased wind shear took toll on the storm and caused a weakening trend. On December\u00a012, Faith lost typhoon intensity, and two days later, Faith weakened into a tropical depression. After striking Vietnam, the depression rapidly dissipated over land. At least 38\u00a0people were killed in Vietnam with over 10,000\u00a0evacuated due to flooding in low-lying areas. Damage in Vietnam exceeded $20\u00a0million."

On the evening of December\u00a011, the JTWC increased the intensity to 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), its peak wind speed. While maintaining peak intensity,[1] Typhoon Faith slowly decelerated while tracking on a west-northwesterly course as it approached the Vietnamese coast due to the effects of another mid-latitude trough, which eroded the subtropical ridge to its north. As a result of this pattern change, Faith began to encounter increased wind shear, which triggered a weakening trend,[2] and at 00:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a012, the JMA downgraded Faith into a severe tropical storm.[9][nb 2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a014, Faith made landfall in Vietnam just north of Nha Trang.[2] At the time of landfall, the JTWC estimated winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph)[7] while the JMA determined that Faith had weakened to a tropical depression.[3] Once inland, the storm began to quickly dissipate;[2] the JMA ceased tracking the system at noon the same day.[3]"

Originating from a trough over the open Pacific Ocean on July\u00a029, Francisco developed into a tropical depression on August\u00a01. Tracking along a northwest course toward Japan, the system steadily intensified over the following days.

Thereafter, the weakened storm traversed the Korea Strait before striking South Korea on August\u00a06. Turning toward the east, Francisco transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August\u00a07. It later impacted Hokkaido before continuing across the northern Pacific and dissipating. In anticipation of Francisco impacting Japan, officials in Kyushu ordered evacuations for coastal residents in and around Miyazaki. Transportation across the region was disrupted, with flights and train service cancelled. The storm brought locally damaging winds and heavy rain. Wind gusts up to 143\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph) downed trees and power lines, leaving 24,710\u00a0households without power.

Situated in a region of low wind shear, favorable upper-level outflow, and traversing northwest over warm waters, development into a tropical cyclone over subsequent days was anticipated.[2] A defined low-level circulation developed the following day, with convective banding features organizing east of its center.[3] Development was temporarily halted on July\u00a031 by insufficient divergence over a majority of the system.[4] Thereafter, favorable conditions fostered organization.[5] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] classified the system as a tropical depression at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a01.[7] Similarly, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Depression 09W at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[8] The JMA estimated the system to have become a tropical storm around 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a02. At this time, the agency assigned it the name Francisco.[7][nb 3] Traveling along a general northwest track toward Japan, the system steadily intensified and attained typhoon status around 09:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05.[7] Typhoon Francisco reached its peak intensity around 12:00\u00a0UTC with ten-minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph)[nb 4] and a pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[7] The JTWC assessed the storm to have intensified slightly through 18:00\u00a0UTC, with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[8] Maintaining this intensity, Francisco made landfall in Miyazaki, Kyushu, around 20:00\u00a0UTC (5:00\u00a0a.m. local time, August\u00a06).[12] Once overland, the system greatly weakened to a low-end tropical storm before emerging over the Korea Strait shortly after 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06.[7] Tropical Storm Francisco made landfall in Busan, South Korea, at 11:20\u00a0UTC (8:20\u00a0p.m. local time) on August\u00a06.[13] Less than an hour after landfall, the Korea Meteorological Administration assessed Francisco to have degenerated into a remnant low;[13] however, the JMA and JTWC continued monitoring it as a tropical cyclone.[7][8] Emerging over the Sea of Japan early on August\u00a07, the system weakened to a tropical depression.[7] The JTWC estimated Francisco to have remained a tropical storm for 12\u00a0more hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone;[8] however, the JMA maintained the system as a tropical cyclone until the following day as it turned east.[7] The storm's remnants later impacted Hokkaido on August\u00a08\u20139 before continuing across the open Pacific.[14] The remnants of Francisco dissipated on August\u00a011, off the east coast of Japan.[7]"

The agency noted a high risk of landslides, flooding, and the possibility of tornadoes.[15] In anticipation of coastal flooding, 20,020\u00a0people were evacuated from Kokuraminami-ku and Moji-ku.[16] Sixty-five public shelters were opened across Kagoshima Prefecture.[17] Farther north, voluntary evacuations were issued for 10,500\u00a0households in Fukuoka, Kitakyushu, and Chukugo.[18] Kyushu Railway Company and Nishi-Nippon Railroad suspended operations on the night of August\u00a05.[19][20] Local ferries were docked for the duration of the typhoon.[21] Airline companies collectively cancelled more than 110\u00a0flights at Miyazaki Airport, Fukuoka Airport, and Osaka International Airport.[22][23] Farmers in Ainan began rice harvests early due to the typhoon.[24] In Miyazaki City, the Prefectural Library and Prefectural Art Museum closed for the morning of August\u00a06; however, they reopened later in the day after the typhoon's passage.[25] Repair work on Kumamoto Castle were suspended to prevent any equipment from damaging the structure.[26] The United States Navy raised the Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness for Fleet Activities Sasebo on August\u00a03. These levels rose as the typhoon approached Japan.[27] Striking Kyushu, Francisco brought heavy rain and strong winds to much of the island.[28] Rainfall peaked at 275\u00a0mm (10.8\u00a0in) in Nobeoka.[29] Most of the rain fell within a 12-hour span, notably 232\u00a0mm (9.1\u00a0in) in Kitaura.[30] Two cities observed record one-hourly rainfall accumulations: 120\u00a0mm (4.7\u00a0in) in both Nobeoka and Saiki.[31] These rains triggered flash flooding in Nobeoka, damaging four homes, inundating many roads, and submerging cars.[32][33] One person died of a heart attack when he was swept away by a flooded river in Kokonoe.[34][35] A maximum wind gust of 143\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph) was observed at Miyazaki Airport.[36] Many trees and signs were felled by the winds citywide, leaving debris strewn across roads. Some structures had windows shattered. Fallen trees took down power lines, leaving 24,710\u00a0homes without power.[37][38] Three people suffered injury, one seriously, after being knocked over by strong winds.[29] Strong winds in Fukuoka damaged a home and prompted the temporary closure of Kanmon Bridge.[39][40] Wind gusts in Saga Prefecture reached 99\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph).[41] Following the typhoon, officials in Miyazaki Prefecture established a relief fund for affected farmers.[42] Overall the rains proved beneficial for Fukuoka Prefecture which had been suffering from a drought. The combined rains from Danas, Francisco, and Lekima aided in filling Fukuoka Prefecture dam, which reached 81.2\u00a0percent capacity.[43] Ahead of the typhoon's landfall in Kyushu, the system brought strong winds and heavy rain to the southern coast of Shikoku.[44] Cape Ashizuri in Tosashimizu experienced peak gusts of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph).[45] Off the coast of Minamib\u014ds\u014d, Chiba, a fishing boat capsized amid rough seas produced by the typhoon on August\u00a05. The boat's captain drowned and the one crew member suffered injury.[46] At Kobe University, a rowing boat with 23\u00a0students aboard capsized due to high winds; the students were able to swim 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) to shore without injury.[47] Humid air brought north by the typhoon exacerbated the effects of a deadly heat wave in eastern Japan.[48] The remnants of Francisco later brought heavy rain to Hokkaido on August\u00a08\u20139. Accumulations reached 147\u00a0mm (5.8\u00a0in) in Ury\u016b.[14] Of this, 137.5\u00a0mm (5.41\u00a0in) fell within 12 hours, a record for that duration in the city.[49] The Uryu River swelled to near-flood stage, prompting evacuation orders for 240\u00a0households in Fukagawa and 80 more in Numata.[50]"

It caused at least 377 deaths and another 74 missing persons, while leaving a wide swath of damage across the country. Being the twenty-third named storm and twelfth typhoon of the 1945 Pacific typhoon season, Louise was first seen developing on October 2 near the Caroline Islands. Moving to the northwest, it slowly organized until it strengthened to a tropical storm on the next day. It then passed between the Northern Mariana Islands on the night of October 4, bringing gale-force winds to the archipelago. It remained at that intensity until it started to approach the Ryukyu Islands on October 9, where it strengthened to a minimal typhoon. While at its peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), it devastated the islands, especially Okinawa. It weakened back to a tropical storm on the next day as it curved to the northeast. Louise then passed through the Ch\u016bgoku region in Japan, then moved out into the Sea of Japan while further weakening below gale-force winds, before dissipating on October 12 near the Tsugaru Strait. Data compiled by the Japan Meteorological Agency showed that Louise killed 377 individuals in Japan, with the majority of deaths in the Nansei Islands,[1] but other contemporaneous estimates suggested over 500 fatalities.[2] The sinking and destruction of U.S. naval vessels present as part of the occupation of Japan contributed to the number of missing individuals and deaths.[3]"

It then shifted to the north-northeast, entering the country's main sea, before dissipating on October 12.[4] However, the data from the Japan Meteorological Agency showed that the system, after its landfall in the region, moved through the Sea of Japan before passing near Noto Peninsula, ahead of becoming extratropical on October 12.

Most immediate was significant rainfall both in the leadup to Louise and also during the approach of Typhoon Ida one month prior.[12] On a longer scale, Japan\u2019s war efforts had caused significant overlogging, which produced erosion-induced river flooding and the loss of intertidal forests which would have otherwise served as a storm buffer.[13][14][15] At the same time, domestic hydraulic engineering projects were suspended and progress on river improvement slowed due to lack of funding.[16]"

The storm struck parts of Kyushu and Ryukyu which had already been ravaged by the war and compounded the effects of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, which had occurred only one month prior, resulting in further devastation to the already destroyed city. The typhoon likely had much higher wind speeds than were recorded at the time, with current estimates of the storm's minimum pressure as low as 917 millibars, though meteorologists are uncertain of the storm's true intensity. The typhoon remains one of the deadliest in Japanese history and is one of only a few storms to be known by a separate name in Japanese."

Spawned by a nearby cold-core low, successive hailstorms in Phoenix and surrounding locations on October\u00a05 caused damage to thousands of homes, businesses, and vehicles. The following day, a record 12\u00a0tornadoes were recorded, multiple strong/EF2 or greater on the Enhanced Fujita scale and many in close proximity to one another; this included two tornadoes rated EF3. Thunderstorms on both days caused significant flash flooding which inundated businesses, stranded vehicles, and closed roadways. Damage throughout the state reached $4.9\u00a0billion, including $2.7\u00a0billion in insured loss from just hail damage, the costliest weather event on record in Arizona. Some impacts occurred in California, Nevada, and Utah as well as the cold-core remained stationary over several days."

        "content": "In 2008, researchers examined the overlap between large-scale environments responsible for producing tornadoes in Northern Arizona. They utilized 38 days between 1950 and 2006 that involved the formation of classic supercell thunderstorms and confirmed tornadoes across the state. Of those 38\u00a0days, researchers found a similar meteorological progression in half of them. The overlapping setup involved the approach of a cold-core low and a favorable placement of the warm sector across Arizona. The approach of these mid- to upper-level lows, detached from the jet stream, allowed for southerly wind vectors to overspread the state. This not only afforded the wind shear necessary for tornadic development, but also provided a supply of warm, moist subtropical air. Compared to previously analyzed tornado environments across the United States, researchers found that Northern Arizona events typically featured marginal instability, averaging around 450\u00a0J/kg.[3] On October\u00a05, 2010, the dominant pattern across the United States bore resemblance to the setups described in previous research. An omega block existed across the country, so named for its uncharacteristically persistent weather conditions across the country on the scale of days to weeks. This omega block was characterized by a high-pressure area over the Central United States and two separate cold-core lows over California and West Virginia.[4] As the western low remained nearly stationary, an unstable atmosphere began to develop across Arizona, prompting the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) to outline a Slight risk across the state.[5] Southeasterly winds at the surface intersected the dryline, providing the impetus for thunderstorm development. Surface dewpoints rose to around 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C), while instability levels resided near 1,000\u00a0J/kg, and strong wind shear values were likewise favorable.[6] A cluster of strong thunderstorms developed across the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area, contributing to a severe hail event there.[7] While this activity also produced sporadic straight-line wind damage,[8] a more robust event into the evening hours was hindered by the loss of daytime heating and the departure of favorable dynamics for severe storm development.[9] By the morning of October\u00a06, forecasters anticipated only a marginal risk of severe weather across Arizona. While instability was expected to climb around 500\u20131,000\u00a0J/kg throughout the afternoon hours, favorable dynamics were expected to shift away from the state and instead be replaced by sinking air aloft.[10] However, as the pre-dawn hours progressed, the overarching cold-core low over California began to retrograde toward the west-northwest. This prolonged the duration of an unstable environment across Arizona,[11] and the SPC once again issued a Slight risk across Arizona accordingly. While large hail and damaging winds were expected to be the primary threats, an isolated tornado risk was also outlined.[12] However, as a well-defined piece of energy rotated around the base of the cold-core low,[13] a more significant tornado event than expected materialized. Rounds of supercells developed across Northern Arizona,[14] producing 11 confirmed tornadoes, the most on record in one day in Arizona and, along with an additional tornado in Utah, the highest number of tornadoes on record in a single event west of the Continental Divide.[15] Many of these tornadoes were strong, EF2 or higher on the Enhanced Fujita scale. One noteworthy aspect of the event is that every tornadic supercell began to show signs of rotation south of the Mogollon Rim, but none of them produced confirmed tornadoes until after they tracked over that geological feature. This strongly suggests that the mountainous terrain had a significant influence on the development of tornadoes that day.[16] Since these supercells moved along a north\u2013south orientation, they not only produced tornadoes in very close proximity to one another, but also contributed to flash flooding throughout the region.[17] Additional severe thunderstorms overspread Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming into afternoon hours before the event subsided.[18][19]"

One storm produced hail up to 1.5\u00a0in (38\u00a0mm) in diameter across Phoenix and into Carefree, damaging roofs and cars and breaking hundreds of skylights.[34] Another storm produced hail up to 2.5\u00a0in (64\u00a0mm) as it tracked from south of Chandler into Scottsdale. These tennis ball sized hail stones damaged hundreds of roofs and vehicles, in addition to damaging dozens of aircraft at the Scottsdale Airport.[35] The most substantial event of the day occurred with a storm that moved from Firebird Lake to south of Chandler into northern Glendale and finally across southern Peoria. Widespread golf ball to baseball sized hail, up to 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) in diameter, damaged thousands of roofs and vehicles. In northwestern Phoenix and Glendale, this hailstorm compounded the effects of the earlier event. One person was injured by large hail on a football practice field. Thirty-four skylights at the St. Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix were punctured, allowing heavy rainfall to flow into the structure. Approximately 20\u00a0percent of the food inventory was ruined, equating to about 1.4\u00a0million meals.[36] In total, more than 150,000\u00a0homes were damaged throughout Maricopa County, forcing thousands of insurance claims.[37] The estimated size of the hail that struck the county was the third largest in Arizona history, and its estimated cost reached $2.7\u00a0billion in insured damages, the costliest weather disaster on record in the state.[38] The stalled cold-core low produced heavy rainfall across the broader Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and California region. Over the course of five days, up to 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) of rain fell across Southern Utah. The Western Regional Climate Center in Reno, Nevada, received 0.92\u00a0in (23\u00a0mm) in just one hour, one of the greatest hourly rainfall rates on record at that location.[39] Flash flooding converged into the Hualapai Canyon and moved toward the village of Supai, Arizona. In advance of the flood, 143\u00a0campers were airlifted to safety. Three tribal pack animals were killed in the village. The canyon was indefinitely closed to tourists following damage to the trail and campground. President Barack Obama declared the Havasupai Canyon a major disaster area and offered federal aid to assist in local recovery efforts. The cost to replace the affected instructure reached $1.63\u00a0million.[40] Heavy rains caused the roof of a structure to collapse in southwestern Phoenix.[41] In Clark County, Nevada, an 8\u201310\u00a0ft (2.4\u20133.0\u00a0m) wall of water pushed into the Callville Bay Marina, destroying most of that structure, rendering many roads impassable, and destroying multiple power poles and cross arms.[42] In numerous cases throughout the region, multiple feet of water washed over roadways, disrupting travel, washing away routes, or stranding vehicles.[43][44] Additional roads were closed by fallen rocks.[45] In Kern County, California, debris flows flowed into several businesses, forcing their closure for many hours.[46] Two 17-year-old boys were struck by lightning in St. George, Utah, and taken to the hospital in critical condition; they were later expected to make a full recovery.[47] Lightning in Tolleson, Arizona, caused a residential structure fire as well.[48] The totality of severe weather in Arizona on October\u00a05\u20136 reached $4.9\u00a0billion.[49] At elevations greater than 7,500\u00a0ft (2,300\u00a0m) throughout the Southern Sierra Nevada, early season snowfall up to 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) was also recorded.[50]"

Located primarily in an area known as Havasu Canyon,[3] this Yuman-speaking population once laid claim to an area the size of Delaware (1.6\u00d710^6 acres\u00a0[6,500\u00a0km2]).[4] In 1882, however, the United States federal government forced the tribe to abandon all but 518 acres (210\u00a0ha) of its land. A silver rush and the Santa Fe Railroad in effect destroyed the fertile land. Furthermore, the inception of the Grand Canyon as a national park in 1919 pushed the Havasupai to the brink, as their land was consistently being used by the National Park Service. Throughout the 20th century, the tribe used the US judicial system to fight for the restoration of the land. In 1975, the tribe succeeded in regaining approximately 185,000 acres (75,000\u00a0ha) of their ancestral land with the passage of the Grand Canyon National Park Enlargement Act.[5] As a means of survival, the tribe has turned to tourism, attracting thousands of people annually to its streams and waterfalls at the Havasupai Indian Reservation."

Although living primarily above and inside the Grand Canyon, which consists mostly of harsh terrain, the tribe's reservation was also home to some lush vegetation and the  aquamarine blue water of Havasu Creek. Their name, meaning \"the People of the Blue-Green Waters,\" reflects this. The Havasupai are said to have existed within and around the Grand Canyon for over eight centuries. Little is known about the tribe before their first recorded European encounter in 1776 with Spanish priest Francisco Garc\u00e9s.[9] Garc\u00e9s reported seeing roughly 320 individuals in his time with the Havasupai, a number that would diminish over the centuries as westward expansion and natural catastrophes significantly decreased the population size.[10] In the first half of the 19th century, with the exception of the introduction of horses by the Spanish, U.S. westward expansion affected the Havasupai less than it did other indigenous populations of the West. Even as interaction with settlers slowly increased, day-to-day life did not change much for the tribe until silver was discovered in 1870 by Cataract Creek.[11] The migration of prospectors to the area was unwelcome. The Havasupai sought protection from the intrusion of Western pioneers on their land and sought out assistance, but to little avail. An executive order by President Rutherford Hayes in 1880 established a small federally protected reservation for the tribe, yet it did not include the mining areas along the Creek (Hirst, 1985). During this era, Havasupai relations with other Native American tribes were generally mixed. Bonds and interactions with the Hopi tribe, whose reservation was in close proximity, were strong, as the two peoples did a great deal of trading with each other.[4] The Hopi introduced crops such as the gourd and sunflower that would eventually become a staple of the Havasupai diet. Still, the Havasupai were not without enemies as they were consistently at odds with the Yavapai and the Southern Paiute, who would steal and destroy crops planted by the Havasupai.[4]"

        "content": "In 1882 President Chester A. Arthur issued an executive order that all land on the plateau of the canyon, which was traditionally used for winter homes for the tribe, was to become public property of the United States.[11] The order in effect relegated the Havasupai to a 518-acre (2.10\u00a0km2) plot of land in Cataract Canyon, taking almost all of their aboriginal land for American public use. According to reports, the Havasupai were completely unaware of the act for several years.[12] The loss of almost all of their land was not the only issue that the Havasupai were contending with: the increase in the number of settlers in the local region had depleted game used for hunting, and soil erosion (a result of poor irrigation techniques) touched off a series of food shortages.[12] Furthermore, interaction with the settlers sparked deadly disease outbreaks amongst tribe members, who were ravaged by smallpox, influenza, and measles.[12] By 1906 only 166 tribal members remained\u00a0\u2013 half the number Garc\u00e9s saw when he first encountered the tribe in 1776.[10]  At one point, there were only 40 women and 40 men of childbearing age, which caused a genetic population bottleneck.[13] In the 1800s, the continental railway system was greatly expanded. In 1897, construction opened on a spur line of the Santa Fe Railroad, which was to lead directly to the Grand Canyon;[12] by 1901, the line was open. During his visit to the Grand Canyon in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt met two Havasupais at Indian Garden. Roosevelt told them about the park that was being created and that they would have to leave the area.[12] In 1908, the Grand Canyon was declared a national monument, and by 1919 it had received National Park status. However, it was not until 1928 that the Havasupai finally left Indian Garden, forced out by the National Park Service.[9]"

        "content": "Issues regarding health within the Havasupai population reduced its growth to the point where almost an entire generation was lost due to infant and child mortality. Low morale spread throughout the tribe, leading to an increase in gambling, alcoholism, and violence. As the years progressed, the Havasupai came to realize that they could not hope to survive in their American social situation without embracing at least some aspects of it. Breaking horses, working on farms, or even serving as employees of the Grand Canyon National Park were all options for tribal members.[11] The Havasupai fought to keep their methods and traditions alive, but the federal government and the National Park Service generally held a dismissive attitude toward these efforts and accelerated the pace of actions such as razing residents' traditional homes and replacing them with cabins.[12] As similar instances transpired throughout the years, the methods of the Park became clear: they wanted the final 518 acres (2.10\u00a0km2).[citation needed] In this period, the tribe continually fought with the government to have the land that had been taken returned to them. In 1968, the tribe won its Indian Claim Commission case against the United States.[14] The court findings stated that the Havasupai had portions of their land taken from them illegally in 1882 and that the tribe was entitled to recover the land from the US at fair market value (ICC 210). That value ended up being 55 cents an acre, totaling just over one million dollars. Although the case was a landmark for the Havasupai in the sense that it was proven in a court of law that the federal government had inappropriately taken their land, it had still not been properly returned to the tribe.[12] However, the momentum that the Havasupai gained from the ICC case followed them into the 1970s as the tribe continued to fight to have their traditional territory returned to them. In 1974, garnering support from the Nixon administration as well as influential newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the San Francisco Chronicle, the tribe made their push to have the congressional bill S. 1296, which would actually return their land, passed through Congress.[12]  Months of deliberation and stalling on the part of some congressmen[citation needed] almost led to the bill's demise. But days before Congress went on fall break, the bill was finally passed by both Houses and made its way to the President's desk. Similarly, the bill sat on President Gerald Ford's desk until the final possible moments before it was signed and passed into law on January 4, 1975.[12] S. 1296 granted the Havasupai a trust title to approximately 185,000 acres (750\u00a0km2); another 95,300 acres (386\u00a0km2) were designated as \"Havasupai Use Lands,\" to be overseen by the National Park Service but available for traditional use by the Havasupai.[5] Mining interests also had a presence in the canyon in this period.  Tunnels are a familiar sight in the campground area with the deepest of them around 300 feet (100\u00a0m).  The largest of the mines is in Carbonate Canyon, adjacent to Havasu Falls, where rails and timbers still can be found descending three levels.  Lead was mined here for the last time during WWII.  Ranger Gale Burak, who worked at the Grand Canyon for several years, spoke of her experiences as a cook for the Havasu Lead and Zinc Company hard rock mining camp,[15] where the campground now resides.  Below Mooney Falls, the famous pipe \"ladder\" ascended to a vanadium deposit."

In the winter, the tribe members stationed themselves on the plateau of the canyon; in the summer, irrigation gardening of the crop fields brought the members back inside the canyon walls.[10] As vast and uneven as the Grand Canyon is, it is somewhat of an anomaly that the Havasupai were able to agriculturally sustain and thrive in such a voluminous landscape. Because of a lack of available soil rich in nutrients, it has been suggested that the tribe cultivated only 200 acres (81\u00a0ha) of land on the canyon floor.[4] Although lacking space, the tribe's irrigation technology was far more advanced than others in the Southwest, allowing them to be agriculturally intensive. However, being located at the bottom of a canyon left the fields vulnerable to flooding due to rain and the overflowing of Cataract Creek, as was the case in 1911 when almost an entire crop field was destroyed.[11] In 1920, to combat the issue, the federal government assisted the tribe in constructing a new irrigation system which was generally effective in ceasing soil erosion from water overflows.[4] Historically, the main crops for the Havasupai were corn, beans, squash, sunflowers, gourds, and some cotton. Corn, the tribe's main crop, was generally harvested in the later summer months. While growing, a farming technique called cepukaka was used to protect the corn from being blown over when it reached a certain height. In this technique, a farmer loosened the soil around the corn and then pulled it into a hill around the stalk base.[4] Along with their traditional crops, the Havasupai were introduced to melons, watermelons, and orchard trees with the arrival of the Spanish. By the 1940s, these crops had become staples of the Havasupai diet.[4]"

The word for \"arrow\" began to stand in for \"bullet\" as well (Whiting, 1985). Throughout the years, sheep and deer were the dominant game for the Havasupai, but small game, including rabbits and squirrels, were also used as food.[4] Historically, the Havasupai hunted in large groups, and the game distribution amongst the hunters was generally fair. In the twentieth century, however, due to overhunting and neighboring development, the populations of large game animals such as sheep became sparse. As a result, the Havasupai were forced to alter their hunting habits to adjust to the expansionists, making tribesmen less likely to share with others.[4]"

Two primary methods were used: 1) knocking seeds from plants directly, and 2) the heads of plants were gathered before the seeds were ready to fall.[4] It was desirable for the women to locate lighter foods that could easily be moved to the plateau in winter.  Additionally, dry foods that could be stored for extended periods of time to prevent spoilage were preferable.[4] Walnuts, wild candytuft, and barrel cacti were only a few of the many plants and seeds gathered by the women throughout the spring and summer months.[4]"

        "content": " Typhoon Cecil, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Loleng,[1] was a mid-season tropical cyclone that affected Japan and South Korea during August\u00a01982. An area of disturbed weather formed to the north of Truk on July\u00a031 and tracked westward over the next several days. Following an increase in shower activity and a decrease in wind shear, a tropical depression developed on August\u00a04. Two days later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. After turning northwestward and then northward, Cecil intensified into a typhoon on August\u00a07, and then began to deepen at a rapid clip. On August\u00a08, Cecil attained its maximum intensity as it brushed Taiwan. There, 19\u00a0people were killed, including 4 in Wugu District, where 2,800\u00a0families sought shelter. After pulling away from Taiwan, Typhoon Cecil moved northwestward, and then on August\u00a010, turned to the north-northeast. Colder air, cooler waters, and higher shear contributed to a weakening trend, and Cecil was downgraded to a tropical storm on August\u00a011. Although Cecil passed east of Japan, it came close enough to the country to drop heavy rains. Nation-wide, three people were killed and two were injured. A total of 2,100\u00a0households lost power in Hinokage. On August\u00a014, Cecil turned east and struck South Korea as a minimal tropical storm before dissipating over the Sea of Japan. Throughout South Korea, 35\u00a0people were killed, 28 went missing, and 28 others sustained injuries. Almost 1,300\u00a0houses were flooded, which resulted in 6,200\u00a0people becoming homeless. Damage was estimated at US$30\u00a0million.[nb 1]"

        "content": "The tropical disturbance that would later become Typhoon Cecil was first distinguishable as a low-level circulation about 465\u00a0km (290\u00a0mi) north of Truk on July\u00a031. Over the next four days, the disturbance tracked westward and remained embedded in the monsoon trough, maintaining a closed surface circulation and an area of enhanced convective activity on satellite imagery. Initially, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was not issued because strong easterly wind shear was expected to inhibit development. On August\u00a04, following an increase in convective activity, a decrease in wind shear, and ship reports in the area measuring central pressures of 1,000\u20131,003\u00a0mbar (29.5\u201329.6\u00a0inHg), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a TCFA.[2] Meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[3][nb 2] The JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05 after a Hurricane Hunter aircraft mission observed sustained winds of 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph).[2] The depression continued to track westward under the influence of easterly steering currents along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge.[2] On August\u00a06, both the JTWC and the JMA classified the depression as Tropical Storm Cecil.[5][nb 3] Cecil briefly turned southward, slowed down, and then curved northwestward.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07, the JTWC upgraded Cecil into a typhoon, with the JMA following suit several hours later. Over the ensuing 24\u00a0hours, Cecil entered a period of rapid deepening, and by 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08, the JTWC had raised the intensity to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[5] Midday on August\u00a08, the JMA reported that Cecil attained its peak intensity of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg).[3] The JTWC estimated that Cecil attained a peak intensity of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) at 18:00\u00a0UTC while located 220\u00a0km (135\u00a0mi) east of Taiwan.[2] As Cecil approached Taiwan from the southeast, it turned sharply northward until reaching the 25th parallel north when Cecil once again assumed a more northwestward track. On August\u00a010, Cecil turned toward the north-northeast and the combined effects of colder ocean temperatures, vertical wind shear, and colder air aloft began to take their toll. On August\u00a011, the JTWC downgraded Cecil to a tropical storm as it tracked northward under the influence of a subtropical ridge.[2] That same day, the JMA briefly downgraded Cecil to a severe tropical storm, although data from the agency suggested that Cecil reached a secondary peak intensity of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) that evening. At 00:00 UTC on August\u00a012, the JMA downgraded Cecil back to a severe tropical storm for the final time. The next day, Cecil was downgraded to a tropical storm by the JMA.[5] By August\u00a014, Cecil had passed to the east of Japan was beyond the northward influence of the subtropical ridge and began to track eastward, striking South Korea as a minimal tropical storm. Cecil's circulation was unable to reorganize after crossing the Korean peninsula and dissipated in the Sea of Japan on August\u00a015,[2] with the JMA ceasing to track the system at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[3]"

Flash flooding claimed one life and resulted in four others missing in Taoyuan.[8] Overall, 19 people perished in the country.[9] After passing Taiwan, rough seas caused by the storm near the Ryukyu Islands left the 24,655\u00a0t (27,177 short tons) World Cosmos and 3,654\u00a0t (4,028 short tons) Marvie ships in distress.[9] The storm dropped heavy rainfall across much of Japan. A peak rainfall total of 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) occurred at Nakagoya Station,[10] including a record 472\u00a0mm (18.6\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours.[11] Within an hour, 70\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in) fell in Nishimera.[12] Moreover, a wind gust of 152\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph) was recorded in Tshigaki.[13] Nation-wide, three people were killed and two others were wounded in Miyazaki Prefecture and Oita Prefecture. In Hinokage, 2,100\u00a0homes lost electricity and 500 residents were evacuated from their homes.[14] Because Cecil, at the time of landfall, was only a minimal tropical storm, the primary threat associated with the storm across South Korea was heavy rainfall.[2] The storm dumped 410\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) of rain in some places,[15] including 550\u00a0mm (22\u00a0in) in Sancheong County. These rains resulted in landslides in 10\u00a0provinces.[15] Nationwide, 35\u00a0people were killed, 28 were missing,[9] and 28 were hurt. Nearly 1,300\u00a0houses were flooded,[16] leaving 6,200\u00a0people homeless.[17] Sancheong County along with the city of Changwon were the hardest hit by the storm, where three mudslides killed nine people and left six missing.[16] In all, damage in the country amounted to US$30\u00a0million.[2]"

This was credited to the development of a very-broad low-level cyclonic circulation, over an area of nearly 15\u00b0 of longitude well offshore Mexico. A tropical wave located several hundred miles to the south of Acapulco gradually entered the cyclonic circulation late on October 26, producing deep convection. Over the next couple of days convective activity halted, until becoming active again following the passage of the MJO on October 29, aiding the formation of a trough of low pressure. The trough slowly drifted northward in a passage between a mid-level ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and a deep mid-to-upper level trough over the Western United States.[1] At 6:00 UTC the next day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor the disturbance for potential tropical cyclogenesis over the next few days.[2]"

In addition, a blue alert was put in effect for central Sonora and central Chihuahua.[7] Ahead of the storm, classes were cancelled in five municipalities of Sinaloa. Local officials prepared more than 60 temporary shelters in Cabo San Lucas and Sinaloa.[8] The Port of Cabo San Lucas shut down on November 3 with the threat of Sonia, closing to ships with more than 500 tons (1 million lbs.) of cargo. Tourists boats meant for water activities were also prohibited from leaving port.[9] As a precautionary measure, over 1,000 residents were evacuated in the cities of Culiac\u00e1n and Navolato.[10] Sonia made landfall near El Dorado, Sinaloa as a rapidly weakening tropical storm on November 4, causing heavy rainfall over portions of Mexico.[1] Several inches of precipitation was recorded in Cabo San Lucas along with winds of around 30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h), as the storm passed close to the resort city.[11] Heavy precipitation also occurred in the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Durango, Chihuahua, and Aguascalientes.[12] In Nayarit, one person was killed after being struck by lightning according to the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA).[1] Total damage in Sinaloa is estimated to be at MXN$8.8 million (USD$453,000).

In one of her few interviews, published in Oggi, an Italian magazine, she later stated that she blamed \"all the problems\" on the Onassis name. Similarly, her stepmother, Gaby Landhage, stated on American television show 20/20 that Athina had told her \"if she could burn all the Onassis money, she would do it.\"[38] On her 18th birthday, Athina took control of her mother's inheritance.[39] After her 21st birthday in 2006, her lawyers unsuccessfully fought to instate her as President of the Onassis Foundation, as the board claimed she was unqualified and denied that she was an heir to the estate of Aristotle Onassis.[40][41] Invoking her grandfather's legacy in memory of Alexander Onassis, the board's representatives stated that she had no connection with the Greek culture, religion, language or shared experience, that she never went to college, and had no work experience.[11]"

The tornado touched down at around 7:40\u00a0a.m. PST (UTC\u201308:00) near 51st Street, taking a north-northeastward path paralleling the Harbor Freeway before lifting near Olympic Boulevard at around 8:05\u00a0a.m. PST. The damage swath was roughly 3.5\u00a0mi (5.6\u00a0km) long and up to 660\u00a0yd (600\u00a0m) wide. Over a hundred homes were damaged, of which around 50 were destroyed. Virtually all power lines in the tornado's path were ruptured and numerous power poles were blown over or snapped by the twister. The tornado also inflicted significant damage to the Los Angeles Convention Center, which required $3\u00a0million in repairs.[b] Losses sustained by public, residential, and commercial infrastructure amounted to $15\u00a0million. As the broader meteorological conditions did not resemble those typically associated with tornadoes, no tornado watch or warning was issued in advance of the tornado and tornadic activity was not anticipated. At least 30\u00a0people were injured, primarily by flying glass, and over a hundred people were displaced due to the damage."

        "content": "The prevailing weather conditions associated with the 1983 tornado did not resemble the conditions commonly considered conducive to strong tornado development. Characteristics such as a strong contrast between air masses, an intense weather front, and tall cumulonimbus clouds with heights reaching 12\u00a0mi (20\u00a0km)\u00a0\u2013 typical for tornado events in the Midwestern United States\u00a0\u2013 were all absent during the Los Angeles tornado. On the morning of March 1, 1983, a low-pressure area was centered 220\u00a0mi (350\u00a0km) off the coast of Northern California. A cold front extended southward from the low-pressure system inland of the California coastline, bisecting the Southern California coast between Oxnard and Los Angeles. The front produced only a weak contrast in air pressure, temperature, and wind, and the broader cyclone was not unusual for the region. At 6:00\u00a0a.m. PST, a weather balloon launched from the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles detected a moist and conditionally unstable layer of air aloft between 1000\u2013760\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.5\u201322.4\u00a0inHg);[c] these conditions were favorable for the development of heavy rain showers. Accordingly, the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast heavy rain showers for the area on March\u00a01 but issued no tornado watch.[3] The Los Angeles tornado occurred between around 7:40\u00a0a.m. to 8:05\u00a0a.m. PST on March\u00a01, lasting for 20\u201325\u00a0minutes. The tornado moved at an average speed of 10\u00a0mph (16\u00a0km/h) on a south-southwest to north-northeast trajectory extending from 51st Street to Olympic Boulevard just east of the Harbor Freeway.[3][1] Coincidentally, Bernard Ferrier, an instructor at USC, was concurrently teaching a class on meteorological observations on the roof of the eight-story Vivian Hall about 0.62\u00a0mi (1\u00a0km) away from the tornado. Before he and his students sought shelter, Ferrier's hand-held anemometer registered wind gusts of at least 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h): the highest mark on the anemometer's scale. Ferrier attempted to look for the funnel cloud associated with the tornado but did not spot any. Los Angeles emergency management received its first report of the tornado at 7:59\u00a0a.m. PST; paramedics responding to a separate incident reported a funnel cloud near the intersection of 47th Street and Broadway.[3] The tornado path ended about 1.5\u00a0mi (2.4\u00a0km) southwest of the Los Angeles Civic Center.[4] Data from a weather radar operated by the NWS in western Los Angeles indicated that cloud tops in the Los Angeles basin rose no higher than 18,000\u00a0ft (5,500\u00a0m) in altitude and that the highest cloud tops were not in the vicinity of the tornado while it was causing damage. None of the radar signatures associated with tornadoes were apparent. In an assessment of the meteorological conditions prepared by the Committee on Natural Disasters of the National Research Council, the committee concluded that \"a tornado forecast or warning would have been difficult to justify\" given the contemporary understanding of tornadoes.[3] The NWS subsequently issued a tornado watch for the Los Angeles area after the tornado occurred;[5]:\u200a1\u200a the watch was lifted during the late afternoon on March\u00a01.[6]:\u200a3"

Either 30 or 32 people suffered injuries, primarily by flying glass;[4][1][3] none of the injuries were serious.[6]:\u200a1\u200a Over a hundred others were rendered homeless as a result of the damage.[3] The significant damage path was approximately 550\u2013660\u00a0yd (500\u2013600\u00a0m) wide, with minimal or negligible damage outside of that swath;[3] the overall affected area spanned approximately 3\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (7.8\u00a0km2).[7]:\u200a13\u200a The tornado came within 0.25\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km) of Los Angeles's high-rise buildings. An estimated $11\u00a0million in losses were sustained by homes and businesses while $4\u00a0million in losses were sustained by the public sector. The Committee on Natural Disasters of the National Research Council assessed the meteorological conditions and damage, concluding that the severity and character of the damage was consistent with a tornado rated F2 on the Fujita scale.[3] Weather researcher Thomas P. Grazulis described the tornado as a \"minimal F2\".[4] Roofs, roofing, and older wood buildings were especially impacted by the tornado. Masonry buildings constructed prior to 1934 were also more heavily damaged than newer or reinforced earthquake-resistant structures. According to the Committee on Natural Disasters, the tornado was a \"complete surprise\" due to the lack of tornado warnings and the erroneous conventional wisdom shared by residents and the NWS that tornadoes did not occur in the region; however, the activation of the Los Angeles Emergency Operations Center in response to the overall storm system on February\u00a028 accelerated response times to the tornado's impacts by about 1.5\u00a0hours.[3] Many buildings sustained parapet, roof, and window damage.[3] The most severe damage occurred near Broadway between 40th and 50th Streets.[5]:\u200a3\u200a The Los Angeles Convention Center sustained significant damage to its roof and upper-level paneling,[3] with over a third of the roof destroyed;[5]:\u200a1\u200a the damage was repaired at a cost of $3\u00a0million by the City of Los Angeles. The twisting of a large billboard downed by the tornado indicated wind speeds potentially in excess of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[3] Several cars were lofted and overturned by the tornado;[3] one driver was injured on the Santa Monica Freeway as the tornado swept across the interstate.[6] :\u200a3\u200a Nearly every overhead power line in the tornado swath was severed by strong winds, including both subtransmission lines and distribution lines. Numerous wooden power poles were also damaged or blown askew; 25\u00a0poles were snapped either at ground-level or at height. Telephone lines were also downed by the storm, resulting in disruption to about 300\u00a0telephone connections; service was restored to 90\u00a0percent of affected customers within five days of the tornado. Total damage to the telephone system amounted to roughly $400,000. Downed power and telephone poles along with debris from buildings led to the closure of some roads and prompted the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to restrict travel on some parts of the Harbor Freeway. The damage wrought by the tornado also caused 165\u00a0natural gas outages affecting residential and commercial areas.[3] Gas and electric service was restored by March\u00a05.[8] The declared disaster area associated with the tornado was bounded by Harbor Freeway to the west, Central Avenue to the east, 7th Street to the north, and Slauson Avenue to the south. The LAPD dispatched 100\u00a0officers to the affected area while the Los Angeles Fire Department dispatched 29\u00a0firefighting companies, three ambulances, and two helicopters.[3] At around 7\u00a0p.m. PST on March\u00a01, an LAPD helicopter dispatched to assist emergency efforts crashed after colliding with a power line on takeoff, killing one person and seriously injuring two others.[6]:\u200a1\u200a The American Red Cross also assisted in the relief effort, establishing a primary shelter for tornado victims at Manual Arts High School that operated from March\u00a01\u20136; the shelter provided aid to 188\u00a0victims and the Red Cross spent $17,024 on relief supplies. The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency provided $1\u00a0million in financial assistance to repair homes while the city's Community Development Department provided free labor to repair homes.[3] Aside from the F2-rated tornado, widespread beach erosion and some flooding resulted from the strong winds and heavy rainfall produced between February\u00a028\u2013March\u00a03 by the low-pressure system over the eastern Pacific. Rainfall totals over the entire period reached as high as 18.4\u00a0in (470\u00a0mm) over higher elevations.[1] Floods impacted several counties, including Los Angeles County. City officials ordered the voluntary evacuation of 800\u00a0homes near the Lopez Canyon city landfall as floodwaters from the saturated landfill threatened to inundate a housing tract.[6]:\u200a13\u200a Flooding in Ventura County inflicted around $1\u00a0million in damage to businesses and homes on February\u00a028, prompting evacuations.[9] Strong winds in Santa Ana, California, overturned a mobile home and damaged 20 other homes at a mobile home park on March\u00a01. The storm system also produced an F0-rated tornado in San Marino, California, at around 8:15\u00a0PST on March\u00a01. That tornado caused minor damage, but injured the driver of a car that was lifted 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) into the air and carried across a highway. A waterspout also occurred off Will Rogers State Beach on March\u00a03.[1]"

With arctic air unusually far south, this helped spawn heavy, wet snowfall across the northern portions of several southern states, including the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. States such as Alabama and Georgia declared a state of emergency in the northern portions of the state due to the possibility of up to 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) of snow, which was normally never seen. School closures were reported across a wide swath of the south due to treacherous conditions, and four people were confirmed to have died as a result of the winter storm. A very uncommon occurrence, the snow in the southern reaches of the United States was considered extremely rare, mainly due in part of how heavy the total accumulations were; in some areas it was their heaviest snowstorm on record. The storm was the third of five winter storms that made their way across the United States in a period lasting from late February into early March."

        "content": "On February 25, a shortwave trough developed over Texas near the Gulf of Mexico. The disturbance moved at a fast pace, initiating cyclogenesis along a stationary front with a surface low developing shortly afterwards.[2] As it moved eastwards, precipitation began to blossom around the low pressure as low level southerly winds enabled moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to advance near and over the stationary front, spreading a large range of precipitation across the South. Due to very cold temperatures pushing well down into the South as part of an unusually cold winter, snow was able to break out in places that rarely observe snowfall, such as Texas and Louisiana.[2] By 21:00\u00a0UTC that day, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) began issuing storm summary bulletins on the developing winter storm as snowfall fell across a large swath of areas.[3] The system steadily deepened over the following hours, spreading accumulating snow across the states of Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, while also triggering a small line of thunderstorms in the state of Florida, prompting a brief tornado watch for that area. At 09:00\u00a0UTC on February 26, as a new area of low pressure began developing closer to the coast,[2] the system achieved a minimum pressure of 994\u00a0mb (29.4\u00a0inHg) just southeast of South Carolina into the Atlantic while snow began ending in the Southeastern states.[4] Meanwhile, accumulating snow began spreading into the Mid-Atlantic states, as the system began moving more to the northeast. By 21:00\u00a0UTC later that day, the system had moved far enough offshore and snow ending in enough areas for the WPC to terminate bulletins on the winter storm.[5]"

Also, the State Patrol announced that they would deploy 174 state troopers to rapidly response to accidents.[8] In addition, schools and universities closed in preparation for the winter storm.[9] The city of Atlanta closed schools early and universities closed, to avoid a repeat of a disastrous handling during a winter storm in January 2014. City officials were also let out early as well.[9] As the storm moved into the Carolinas, North Carolina governor Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency on February 25, The state deployed roughly 1,700 equipment crews to treat roadways and residents were urged to not travel at all if weather permitted to be bad.[10][11] Major power outages were reported across the state, primarily in the central parts, totaling around 230,000, primarily due to branches and power line being weighed down after snow transitioned to sleet and rain. In addition, state troopers helped residents stuck on treacherous roads.[11] In Raleigh, crews responded to around 60 accidents.

The strongest storm, known as the De Witte typhoon, reached a minimum barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg), before striking eastern China. On May 22, 1901, the Manila Observatory in the Philippines (then a territory of the United States) was renamed the Philippine Weather Bureau, whose successor eventually became the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration.[2][3]"

It moved to the west and later to the west-southwest, dissipating on February 5 between Borneo and Vietnam.[4] There was a storm in April and another two in May.[1] On May 14, a tropical cyclone was observed just east of Samar, an island in the east-central Philippines. Estimated to have reached typhoon intensity, the storm moved westward through the Visayas archipelago, producing a barometric pressure of 971\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg) aboard a ship. The storm curved northeastward in the South China Sea, striking Taiwan on May 20. The storm proceeded through the Ryukyu Islands and was last noted on May 23.[5][6] There were two storms in June. The first was observed on June 1 into the following day, moving northeastward while remaining east of Taiwan.[7] A typhoon formed east of Luzon on July 12. It moved westward, crossing Cagayan and Ilocos before entering the South China Sea. The system intensified and crossed Hainan, ultimately making landfall on northern Vietnam on July 16, where it soon dissipated. At Haiphong, winds reached 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph), and the minimum pressure fell to 967\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg).[6]"

It moved west-northwestward, entering the East China Sea on August\u00a01.[9] That day, the Russian steamer De Witte encountered the typhoon's rough waves and high winds, which damaged the ship's railings. On August\u00a02, while the ship was about 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) north of Taiwan, a large wave washed overboard and flooded the engine room; this forced the crew to evacuate into two boats,[10] and after two days they were rescued.[11][10] Known as the De Witte typhoon, the storm continued to intensify until reaching a peak late on August 2, when a minimum barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg) was recorded.[12] At its peak, the typhoon had an elliptical 13\u00a0km (8\u00a0mi) eye, moving west-northwestward at 11 to 24\u00a0km/h (7 to 15\u00a0mph), with gale-force winds extending 565\u00a0km (351\u00a0mi) from the center.[8] On August\u00a03, the storm struck eastern China, near the border of Chekiang and Hokkien provinces. It rapidly weakened and dissipated over land.[8][9] The trajectory of the storm and nearby stations provided an opportunity to study the mechanics of intense tropical cyclones' movements.[12] Ishigaki Island, part of the Ryukyu Islands, recorded peak winds of 60\u00a0km/h (37\u00a0mph) while the storm passed to the north.[12] In addition to wrecking the De Witte, the typhoon also damaged two other boats.[11] Onshore mainland China, the typhoon flooded the region around Wenzhou several miles inland due to increased levels along the Ou River. On Lingkun Dao near the city, the storm destroyed an embankment, killing many people. Regional officials later provided coffins for the deceased, as well as rice and money for survivors. Heavy damage occurred around Wenzhou.[13]"

A northwest trajectory brought the system through the Ryukyu Islands, and the storm ultimately dissipated over eastern China on August\u00a024, having moved ashore near Wenzhou.[15] On September\u00a08, a low pressure area formed east of the Philippines. It intensified into a tropical storm while moving to the northwest, passing near the Ryukyu Islands on September\u00a017. After bypassing Taiwan to the north, the storm approached the mouth of the Yangtze in eastern China, before recurving to the northeast. It was last noted on September\u00a021 in the Sea of Japan.[6][16] On the last day of the month, a typhoon formed west of Palau. Steered to the northwest, the storm moved across northern Luzon, hitting Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan. After emerging into the South China Sea, the storm turned to the northeast, brushing the Batanes islands as well as southeastern Taiwan on October\u00a04. Crossing the Ryukyu Islands, the storm was last noted on October\u00a06 to the southwest of Kyushu.[6][17] A westward-moving tropical cyclone was noticed on October\u00a012 to the east of the Philippines.[18] With wind speeds approaching 269\u00a0km/h (167\u00a0mph), the typhoon passed north of Polillo Island before crossing Luzon, bypassing Manila about 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) to the north. Seven boats were wrecked during the height of the storm.[19] Along the Pasig River, a lorcha (Chinese boat) was left adrift after separating from a towboat, causing it to capsize along the breakwater; one person was killed in the incident, while the others swam to safety.[20] Three American soldiers also died in the typhoon, alongside many Filipinos. Considered one of the most severe typhoons in 20\u00a0years by newspapers, the storm downed most telegraph lines and damaged many houses. In the capital Manila, most streets were flooded in the Paco district up to a foot deep. Rainfall during the storm reached 4.063\u00a0in (103.2\u00a0mm).[19] After leaving the Philippines, the typhoon progressed westward into the South China Sea and was last noted on October\u00a018 south of Hainan island.[18] On October\u00a018, a short-lived tropical cyclone existed east of the Ryukyu Islands. It was moving northeastward and was last noted on the next day.[21] A tropical storm was first observed on October\u00a021 and moved westward through the Philippines over the succeeding days. It crossed the South China Sea and dissipated over east-central Vietnam on October\u00a026.[22] Concurrently, a tropical cyclone was noted on October\u00a024 northeast of the Philippines. It curved northwestward and later turned to the northeast, and was last noted on October\u00a029 east of Okinawa.[23] There was one additional storm in October, and one each in November and December.[1]"

The fourth named storm and the third typhoon of this season, Man-yi formed from a monsoon trough near the Philippines on July 5. The disturbance gradually organized and on 12:00 UTC on July 27, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the developing system. Under favorable conditions, the disturbance rapidly organized to a tropical storm, with the JMA naming it Man-yi. As it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on July 11, the storm explosively organized on the Philippine Sea, before passing near Okinawa on 13:00 UTC on the next day. Man-yi began to weaken on July 13 due to increasingly unfavorable conditions, before scraping southern Japan on the night of the same day. Due to the deteriorating conditions of the typhoon, the JMA and the JTWC downgraded the system to a tropical storm, before issuing their final warning as it became extratropical on July 15. As a result of the typhoon, a Chinese vessel sank about 600 kilometers northwest of Guam, killing three of its crew members and leaving seven others missing. An 11-year-old boy was feared to be dead after he was swept away by a fast-moving river while trying to pick up a ball. Total damages from the typhoon were unknown."

It entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, as both the PAGASA and JMA stated that Man-yi became a typhoon, with the former naming it Bebeng.[5] Moving over warmer waters, Man-yi underwent rapid intensification late on July 11 and early on July 12, as it churned towards Okinawa in Japan, shortly before the JTWC declared Man-yi as a super typhoon.[6] The PAGASA issued their final bulletin for the storm as it left out of their area of responsibility, before hitting Ryukyu Islands as a Category 4 super typhoon.[6] As the typhoon entered unfavorable conditions, adding the brief land interaction with the nearby Japan, it slowly weakened until it made landfall in Kagoshima Prefecture on Ky\u016bsh\u016b early the next day before turning to the east and making two more in K\u014dchi Prefecture on Shikoku and in Wakayama Prefecture on Honsh\u016b.[7] As it interacted with the country and the nearby jet stream, Man-yi rapidly degraded to a tropical storm and started extratropical transition, on July 14.[8] It became extratropical on the next day, ending the advisories of JMA and the JTWC.[9]"

It is one of the five towns that make up the Cinque Terre region.  Vernazza is the fourth town heading north, has no car traffic, and remains one of the truest \"fishing villages\" on the Italian Riviera. It is the only natural port of Cinque Terre and is famous for its elegant houses.[3] Vernazza's name is derived from the Latin adjective verna, meaning \"native\". The aptly named indigenous wine, vernaccia (\"local\" or \"ours\"), helped give birth to the village's name. It is one of I Borghi pi\u00f9 belli d'Italia (\"The most beautiful villages of Italy\").[4]"

        "content": "The first records recognizing Vernazza as a fortified town date to 1080.  Referred to as an active maritime base of the Obertenghi, a family of Italian nobility, it was a likely point of departure for naval forces in defence from pirates.[5] Over the next two centuries, Vernazza was vital in Republic of Genoa's conquest of Liguria, providing port, fleet, and soldiers.  In 1209, approximately 90 of the most powerful families of Vernazza pledged their allegiance to the republic of Genova. The first documented presence of a church dates to 1251, with the parish of San Pietro cited in 1267. Reference to the Church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia of Vernazza occurs in 1318. Some scholars[who?] are of the opinion, due to the use of materials and mode of construction, that the actual creation of the Church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia took place earlier, some time in the 12th century. The Church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia was expanded upon and renovated over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries, and thereafter was erected the octagonal bell tower that rises from the apse. In the 15th century, Vernazza focused its defence against the dreadful and regularly occurring pirate raids, erecting a fortifying wall. In the mid-17th century, like many of the Cinque Terre villages, Vernazza suffered a period of decline that negatively affected wine production, and prolonged the construction of the trail system and harbour molo (mole constructed to protect against heavy seas). In the 19th century, after a long period of stagnation, Vernazza returned to wine production, enlarging and creating new terraced hillsides.  The result was a revitalisation of Vernazza's commerce.  Also at this time, the construction of the Genoa\u2013La Spezia rail line began, putting an end to Vernazza's long isolation. The population of Vernazza increased by 60% as a result. Meanwhile, the construction of La Spezia's naval base also proved important to Vernazza in providing employment for many members of the community. With the arrival of the 20th century, Vernazza experienced a wave of emigration as working the land was viewed as dangerous and the cause of disease, and the ability to further exploit agriculture diminished. In 1997, the Cinque Terre was recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and in 1999 the National Park of the Cinque Terre was created.  Today the main source of revenue for Vernazza is tourism.  However, as a testimony to the strength of centuries-old tradition, fishing, wine and olive oil production still continue. On 25 October 2011, Vernazza was struck by torrential rains, massive flooding, and mudslides affecting not only Cinque Terre, but also Val di Vara and Val di Magra within Liguria, as well as the province of Lunigiana.\nThe flood left the town buried in over 4 metres of mud and debris (submerging even the train station in mud), causing over 100 million euro worth of damage. The town was evacuated and remained in a state of emergency for many months.[6]"

By this time, outflow had become established and curvature of the Maysak's rainbands became apparent on satellite imagery.[11] The storm's cloud tops cooled substantially, indicative of further consolidation of its circulation.[12] Maysak became a severe tropical storm twelve hours later.[13] Maysak became a typhoon by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029 according to the JMA after developing an eye. The storm also began to move towards the north in response to a nearby subtropical ridge.[14][15][16] On August\u00a030, Maysak's structure became indicative of an impending phase of rapid intensification according to the JTWC.[17] The typhoon developed a central dense overcast that day with an eye embedded within.[18] An approaching trough over eastern China and western Japan caused Maysak to accelerate towards the north as it continued to traverse energetic ocean waters.[19] The typhoon's eye became symmetric and spanned 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) across.[20] By 21:00\u00a0UTC, the eye had contracted to a diameter of 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi). Around that time, the JTWC assessed the typhoon as having one-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph).[21] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, the JMA determined that Maysak had ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) with gusts of up to 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). The associated barometric pressure was estimated at 935\u00a0hPa (mbar; 27.61\u00a0inHg).[22][23] Maysak held this intensity as it began to move into a less conducive environment for storm development within the East China Sea.[24] Soon, Maysak began to weaken steadily as it passed the East China Sea, slowing back down to a Category 3 storm. The storm then made landfall near Busan, South Korea at 02:20 KST on September 3 (17:20 UTC on September 2), with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) and the central pressure at 950 hPa[25] equivalent into a Category 2 typhoon. After that, it crossed the Sea of Japan and hitting North Korea into Jilin in northeast China. Soon after, Typhoon Maysak transitioned into an extratropical low in northeast China.[26]"

As many as 266\u00a0flights linking to Okinawa were cancelled, affecting roughly 9,200\u00a0travelers.[28][31][32] The Naha Airport closed its passenger terminal in advance of Maysak.[32] The cancellation of flights at Okinawa also led to the cancellation of 10\u00a0percent of departures from Haneda Airport.[33] Kadena Air Force Base was placed on Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness level 1 (TCCOR 1), denoting the onset of destructive winds.

Hagupit intensified into a typhoon on August 3, before making landfall in Wenzhou, China at 19:30 UTC that day at peak intensity. Hagupit subsequently weakened over China, before degenerating into an extratropical low on August 5. Hagupit's remnants persisted for another several days, as the storm moved eastward, before dissipating south of Alaska on August 14. Hagupit caused over a foot of rainfall in portions of Eastern China and South Korea.

Being also the tenth named storm and this season's fifth typhoon, Haishen's origins can be tracked back to a disorganised low pressure area situated near Guam. While the disturbance tracked south-westward and quickly organised, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system, and a day later, on September 1, the system became a tropical depression.[1] The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Haishen according to the Japan Meteorological Agency as it moved southwestward.[2] At about 12:00 UTC on September 2, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geological and Astronomical Services Administration indicated that Haishen had entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was subsequently named Kristine.[3][4] Later that day, Haishen became a typhoon. Intensification on September 3 was significant. Drifting northwestward into extremely favorable conditions, Haishen became a category 3-equivalent typhoon, acquiring a pinhole eye, before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle (EWRC). Strengthening resumed soon after and the JTWC assessed wind speeds of 135\u00a0kn (155\u00a0mph; 250\u00a0km/h) as it peaked as a powerful Category 4 super typhoon and had attained a new, symmetrical, clear eye.[5][6] Traversing northward toward land while gaining latitude, ocean heat content became unfavorable for supporting such a strong system, and while the central pressure decreased, the system's wind speeds began decreasing, as the structure began degrading. The eye's former shape was no longer present as it appeared ragged on satellite imagery, and Dvorak analysis indicated that Haishen was beginning to weaken steadily. On September 5, Haishen began to lose its eye as its inner eyewall began contracting, and it subsequently weakened to a category 3-equivalent typhoon.[7] On September 6, Haishen made landfall on Japan and South Korea as a strong category 2-equivalent typhoon.[8] Haishen was the third typhoon within a span of two weeks to make landfall in the Korean Peninsula, the others being Bavi and Maysak."

By the next day, the disturbance had quickly organized, and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the low-pressure area.[9] By the next day, it intensified into Tropical Depression 11W.[1] Traversing generally south-westward, the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm.[2] The JMA soon followed and upgraded the system into a tropical storm as well, and was given the international name Haishen. Later that day, Haishen became a severe tropical storm as it headed southwest into the Philippine Sea. Intensification on September 3 was significant - with Typhoon Haishen acquiring a pinhole eye early in the day, but it later underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. The cycle completed quickly, however, and strengthening resumed almost immediately. Then, the JTWC noted the possibility of Haishen becoming a Category 5 super typhoon in one of their advisories. Entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), the Philippine Atmospheric, Geological and Atmospheric Services Administration (PAGASA) named the system Kristine.[3][4] Early on September 4, the JTWC assessed that Haishen became a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon - with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 135\u00a0kn (155\u00a0mph; 250\u00a0km/h),[5] with a clear, symmetrical eye visible on satellite imagery.[6] On September 5, as Haishen's latitude increased, the ocean heat content in the area decreased,[10] which disrupted the system's core and caused its eye to appear ragged on satellite imagery, subsequently indicating weakening, and dropping below super typhoon status.[7] Later that day, the system left the PAR and PAGASA issued its last bulletin on the typhoon.[11] As the system continued its northward track toward the Japanese archipelago, it continued to weaken and became a category 3 typhoon as Haishen made another eyewall replacement cycle, and not too long after it dropped to a category 2 typhoon as it neared the Southern Ryukyu Islands of Japan. A mandatory evacuation order was issued for western Japan as millions of people evacuated accordingly.[8] Haishen made landfall in Ulsan, South Korea at around 09:00 KST (00:00 UTC) on September 7,[12] with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and the central pressure at 955\u00a0hPa (28.20\u00a0inHg). Shortly after, Haishen entered the Sea of Japan as a high-end tropical storm; due to the low-sea surface temperatures, Haishen quickly weakened and made landfall in the South Hamgyong Province, North Korea with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 980 hPa (28.94 inHg).[13] Soon afterwards, JTWC issued its final warning on Haishen, as it moved further inland into North Korea.[14] At 18:50 UTC, JMA issued its last advisory on Haishen, and declared it an extratropical low as it moved near the China\u2013North Korea border.[13]"

The eighteenth named storm and eighth typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Molave originated from a tropical depression that formed on October 23 east of Palau. At 15:00 UTC the next day, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Molave as it drifted generally northwestward. Molave soon became a typhoon on October 25 as it turned west, shortly before making five landfalls in central Philippines. After striking the Philippines, Molave entered the South China Sea and began to re-intensify. Molave attained its peak intensity on October 27 before weakening again as it approached Vietnam. The typhoon struck Vietnam on October 28, before rapidly weakening as it headed further into Indochina. Molave later dissipated on October 30, over Myanmar.

Now a tropical storm, the system was named Molave by the JMA.[5][6][7] The next day, PAGASA upgraded the system into a severe tropical storm as it approached Bicol.[8] Later that day, the PAGASA then upgraded Molave into a typhoon as it headed for Albay and Camarines Sur, prompting the raising of TCWS#3 for both and adjacent provinces.[9] Shortly afterwards, the JMA also upgraded the system to a typhoon and the JTWC followed a few hours later.[10][11] At 18:10\u00a0PHT (10:10\u00a0UTC), Molave made its first landfall on the San Miguel Island in Albay, with another one in Malinao just 40 minutes later. Molave made three more landfalls in San Andres, Quezon at 22:30\u00a0PHT (14:30\u00a0UTC), Torrijos, Marinduque at 1:20\u00a0PHT October\u00a026 (17:20\u00a0UTC), and Pola, Oriental Mindoro at 3:30\u00a0PHT (19:30\u00a0UTC).[12] Molave emerged over the South China Sea on the same day, continuing to gradually intensify as it left the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and drifted away from the Philippines. The state of Sabah in Malaysia was also affected by the typhoon which was reported to be at 703 kilometers off southwest Kudat, causing rough seas with waves reaching up to 3.5\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft) in the west coast of Sabah including Labuan.[13] Molave strengthened into a powerful Category 3 typhoon under relatively favorable conditions. As the system continued westwards, the storm began to slowly weaken as it approached Vietnam. Subsequently, the storm turned slightly to the west-northwest. Molave made landfall on Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i province, central Vietnam at 10:10 UTC+7 (03:10 UTC), October 28 with category 2 typhoon strength.[14] The storm rapidly weakened once inland, with the JTWC issuing their final warning on the system while it still had Typhoon force winds on October 29, as the storm's convection became increasingly disorganized. The JMA continued to track the system as a Tropical Depression over Cambodia until they issued their final advisory on October 30. The storm dissipated shortly afterward, over Myanmar."

        "content": " Typhoon Goni, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Rolly, was an extremely powerful tropical cyclone that made landfall as a Category 5 equivalent super typhoon on Catanduanes in the Philippines, and in Vietnam as a tropical storm. It is the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record by 1-minute maximum sustained winds. The name \"Goni\" means swan in Korean. The nineteenth named storm, ninth typhoon, and second super typhoon of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season, Goni originated as a tropical depression south portion of Guam on October\u00a026. It was then named as Tropical Storm Goni on October\u00a027. On the next day, Goni explosively intensified over the Philippine Sea, becoming a Category\u00a05\u2013equivalent super typhoon on October 30. Goni maintained Category\u00a05 strength for over a day, before making landfall on Catanduanes at peak intensity, with 10-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph),[1] and 1-minute sustained winds of 315\u00a0km/h (195\u00a0mph), with a minimum central pressure of 905\u00a0hPa (mbar; 26.72\u00a0inHg). It was the most intense tropical cyclone observed worldwide in 2020.[2] Following its first landfall, Goni rapidly weakened while it moved over the Sierra Madre mountain range of the Philippines. The storm brought severe flash flooding to Legazpi, as well as lahar flow from the nearby Mayon Volcano. There were widespread power outages as well as damaged power and transmission lines in Bicol. Crops were also heavily damaged. Over 390,000 out of 1\u00a0million evacuated individuals have been displaced in the region. Due to the extreme wind speed of the typhoon, two evacuation shelters had their roofing lost. Debris and lahars had also blocked various roads, as well as rendering the Basud Bridge impassible. In Vietnam, where Goni made landfall as a tropical depression, there was flooding in numerous areas, as well as eroded and damaged roads. This exacerbated the 2020 Central Vietnam floods, causing an estimated \u20ab543 billion (US$23.5 million). In all, the typhoon killed at least 32 people and caused at least \u20b120\u00a0billion (US$359\u00a0million) worth of damage.[3] The COVID-19 pandemic was also a concern for people in evacuation centers.[4] After Goni moved into the South China Sea, it weakened to a tropical storm. It started to move generally westward towards Vietnam. It eventually reached the country late on November\u00a05 as a tropical depression, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds. International relief from several countries as well as the United Nations followed soon after the typhoon moved away from the Philippines.[5] The relief included donations totaling up to $11.48 million and protection from the pandemic, among other items."

        "content": "After Typhoon Molave devastated the Philippines, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) announced the formation of a new tropical depression in the Pacific Ocean, west of the Mariana Islands, on October\u00a027.[6] Given its proximity to the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), along with its westward forecasted track, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began issuing advisories on the newly formed system.[7] By the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) had also followed and upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[8] The storm had good outflow and structure as it approached the PAR.[9] As the system continued tracking westward under favorable conditions in the Pacific Ocean, the JMA and JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm, with the JMA assigning the name Goni to the intensifying system.[10][11][12] The PAGASA followed with an upgrade to a severe tropical storm a few hours later.[13] Due to the warm waters surrounding the storm, the system underwent rapid intensification and became a typhoon on October\u00a029.[14][15] On October 29, at 09:30 UTC, Goni entered the PAR and was named Rolly by the PAGASA.[16] Early on the following day, the system was declared a super typhoon by the JTWC a few hours later, the second super typhoon of the season, before further intensifying into the first Category 5-equivalent super typhoon of the season by 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a030.[17] After undergoing a brief eyewall replacement cycle on October\u00a031, which is a typical process for a storm of such high intensity,[18] it resumed intensifying, with the JTWC, JMA, and Satellite Analysis Branch[19] all assessing Dvorak technique T-numbers of 8.0, the highest on the scale. On this basis, the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 315\u00a0km/h (195\u00a0mph), tying with Haiyan in 2013, Meranti in 2016 and Surigae in 2021 as the highest reliably estimated in the Eastern Hemisphere. Meanwhile, the JMA estimated a central barometric pressure of 905\u00a0hPa (mbar; 26.72\u00a0inHg) for the storm,[20][21][22] while the JTWC estimated a minimum central pressure of 884\u00a0hPa (mbar; 26.1\u00a0inHg).[22] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a031 (2:00\u00a0PHT November\u00a01), hours before Goni's first landfall, PAGASA upgraded Goni into a super typhoon. This was the second time that the PAGASA declared a system as a super typhoon since its introduction of the revised tropical cyclone intensity scale,  the first being Haima in 2016. This is also the second time that the highest wind warning level, Signal #5, was raised in the Philippines as per the revised tropical cyclone wind signals. At 20:50\u00a0UTC on October\u00a031 (4:50\u00a0PHT November\u00a01), Goni made landfall in Bato, Catanduanes, Philippines, at peak intensity, as a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon.[23][24] The JMA and PAGASA both reported 10-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph)[25] and 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), respectively,[23] while the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 315\u00a0km/h (195\u00a0mph) at the time of landfall.[22] By 1-minute sustained winds, this made Goni the strongest recorded tropical cyclone to ever make landfall anywhere in the world.[20][26] Goni made additional landfalls in Tiwi, Albay at 23:20\u00a0UTC and San Narciso, Quezon at 04:00\u00a0UTC, on November\u00a01.[27][28] Goni then made its fourth and final landfall in the Philippines in Lobo, Batangas at 09:30\u00a0UTC.[29] Interaction with land, plus an increase in wind shear caused Goni to rapidly weaken and it emerged over the South China Sea as a minimal tropical storm.[30][31] Before exiting the PAR, Goni slightly reintensified, but further development was hampered by unfavorable conditions.[32][33] The system exited the PAR at 12:00 UTC (20:00 PHT) on November 3.[34]  Goni's convection decoupled from its low-level circulation as a result of anticyclonic shear generated by the nearby Tropical Storm Atsani (Siony) from Northern Luzon, before making landfall in Vietnam on November 6. Goni rapidly weakened after landfall, degenerating into a trough by 00:00 UTC on the next day. Goni's remnant trough then brought rain and more flooding to an already rain-stricken Vietnam from previous Linfa, Nangka, Ofel, and Molave, which had all struck the same region a few weeks earlier."

At the same time, the Camarines Norte Incident Management Team began evacuating 35,000 families, around 159,000 people, from high-risk areas, including coastal villages inside the province's bayside capital, Daet.[37] On the same day, the NDRRMC raised a nationwide red alert in preparation for the storm's impact.[38] The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, one of the largest COVID-19 sample testing laboratories in the country, announced a temporary suspension of operations on November\u00a01 and 2 in order to mitigate damage to their building and equipment.[37] As the typhoon neared the country, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology had issued advisories warning of possible lahar contamination of nearby rivers and drainage areas near Mount Pinatubo, the Mayon Volcano, and the Taal Volcano.[39][40] On the morning of the October\u00a031, less than 24 hours before the typhoon made landfall, PAGASA raised a Signal #3 tropical cyclone warning signal for Catanduanes, with the same signal being raised for the northeastern portions of both Albay and Camarines Sur a few hours later.[41][42] Local governments across Camarines Sur began forced evacuations, with the province's Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council expecting the evacuation of 20,000 families before noon.[43] By noon, the Camarines Norte government had evacuated 6,645 individuals from 75 villages out of a planned 159,000.[44] Food packs worth 8.3\u00a0million, non-food items worth 26.42\u00a0million, and 3\u00a0million in stand-by funds were prepared in the Bicol Region by the Department of Social Welfare and Development, together with local disaster response agencies. Evacuation centers in Aurora were also prepared, with some school buildings designated for use as shelters.[45][46] In Metro Manila, mayors of the constituent cities have begun their own preparations for the upcoming typhoon, such as halting construction and ordering the dismantling of tents and other outdoor structures. The Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office of Manila has prepared rescue boats for potential rescue operations.[47] By evening, PAGASA raised the first Signal #4 tropical cyclone warning of the year in Catanduanes and the eastern portion of Camarines Sur, and in the northern portion of Albay a few hours later.[48][49] By the end of the day, almost a million individuals were evacuated: 749,000 from Albay and 200,000 from Camarines Sur; this exceeded the number of people evacuated ahead of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.[50][51][26] The Manila International Airport Authority announced that Ninoy Aquino International Airport would be temporarily closed for 24 hours, beginning 10:00\u00a0am the following day.[52] Closures in ports left 1,300 passengers stranded in Bicol and Eastern Visayas.[53] Many existing evacuation centers, usually basketball courts and multi-purpose halls, were already being used by victims of the COVID-19 pandemic, which complicated evacuation for those affected by the typhoon.[54] At 2:00 AM today, Typhoon #RollyPH intensified into a Super Typhoon. TCWS #5 will be raised over Catanduanes, Eastern Camarines Sur, and Albay. Catastrophic wind damage is expected. 31 Oct 2020[55] By the early morning of November\u00a01, hours prior to Goni's landfall, the PAGASA raised Signal #5, the highest tropical cyclone warning signal, in Catanduanes, Albay, and the eastern portion, and eventually the whole, of Camarines Sur.[24] On the morning of Goni's first landfall, the PAGASA raised Signal #4 for the country's capital, Metro Manila.[56] All rail lines, including the Manila Light Rail Transit System and the Manila Metro Rail Transit System suspended operations, along with the EDSA Busway and the PNR Metro Commuter Line.[57] A total of 480,174 individuals were preemptively evacuated in 8 regions.[58]"

Damage to the abaca crop on the island caused by the typhoon is estimated to cost \u20b1400\u00a0million, with other crops' totalling \u20b1200\u00a0million.[99] The total economic loss from the general damage of the typhoon was estimated to be $1.0 billion.[101] Broadcast news coverage on Goni was significantly reduced compared to typhoons in previous years because of the shutdown of the ABS-CBN broadcast network, which had local news bureaus and strong signal reach in provinces far from Manila. This caused difficulties in disseminating information about Goni to remote localities where only the said network could reach, resulting in people voicing their frustrations on social media during and after the typhoon.[102][103][104] In the Bicol Region alone, over 96,000 families or about 346,000 individuals were in evacuation centers. 390,028 individuals were displaced from their homes, and 1,103 passengers remain stranded in the ports.[73][105] In Aurora, 9,747 individuals were displaced from their homes.[106] About 226 schools have been damaged by the typhoon, including 7,169 learning materials and 194 computer sets; the majority of which were within Bicol but some were in Mimaropa and Calabarzon.[107] In total, 68.6\u00a0million people have been affected by Typhoon Goni in some way, including 724,000 children in the most affected areas.[108] The NDDRMC had already recommended to not fill evacuation centers completely to comply with social distancing regulations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 before the typhoon struck the country.[109] The Department of Health recommended the usage of modular tents and immediate symptoms screening in evacuation centers,[110][111] while Secretary of Health Francisco Duque III asked local government to deploy safety officers to prevent the spread of the disease.[112] Nevertheless, many health facilities were damaged by the typhoon, and health workers struggled to get to evacuation centers due to floods.[110] In Manila, which had been battling numerous COVID-19 outbreaks, Mayor Francisco Domagoso said that the city struggled to strictly follow health protocols in evacuation centers.[72] Due to the complications encountered when assigning evacuation centers, Congress has since revived talks on the construction of dedicated evacuation centers.[54][110] On November\u00a02, Camarines Sur officials placed the province under a state of calamity,[113] with Catanduanes doing the same on November 4.[114] During the 37th ASEAN Summit on November 12, President Rodrigo Duterte urged the organization members to help in fighting against climate change.[115]"

The fifteenth named storm of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season, Linfa originated from a tropical depression which formed just to the west of the Philippines on October 6. After passing through the island nation, the storm emerged into the South China Sea and slowly gained strength, earning the name Linfa on October 10 on approach to Vietnam. On the next day, Linfa had reached peak strength and made landfall in Vietnam, marking the beginning of a devastating series of floods in the country and worsening the already active monsoon season. Linfa quickly dissipated as it moved inland, but associated thunderstorms continued for several days. Linfa brought record breaking rainfall totals throughout much of the Indochinese Peninsula. 112 people were left dead in Vietnam, with 24 missing. An additional 25 people died in Cambodia and there was 1 killed in Laos with 3 missing. Damage totals throughout Vietnam reached up to US$217 million, or 4.9 trillion \u0111\u1ed3ng. Linfa was also the second-deadliest storm of 2020, closely behind Hurricane Eta and the deadliest of the annual typhoon season."

        "content": "According to post-analytic data by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Linfa developed as a weak tropical depression just to the east of Bicol Region, Philippines on 18:00 UTC of October 6.[2] After crossing the Philippine archipelago of Luzon and entering the waters of the South China Sea, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on October 9.[3] Shortly thereafter, the JMA began operationally tracking the system around 12:00 UTC that day.[4] Twelve hours later, the JMA started initiating advisories on the developing system.[5] After animated satellite imagery depicted a defined low-level circulation center (LLCC) along with flaring deep convection,[6] the JTWC followed suit on classifying the system as a tropical depression and began issuing advisories, giving the identifier of 17W.[7] Being located in warm sea-surface temperatures and low wind shear, the system's overall structure quickly improved.[8] Due to this, the JTWC upgraded 17W to a tropical storm on 15:00 UTC of October 10.[9] Three hours later, the JMA also upgraded the system to a tropical storm, receiving the name Linfa \u2013 the fifteenth named storm of the annual typhoon season.[2] Linfa slowly consolidated throughout the rest of the day. Microwave imagery depicted continued wrapping of deep convection to its LLCC, which prompted the JTWC to increase Linfa's 1-minute sustained winds to 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[10] By 00:00 UTC of October 11, Linfa reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994\u00a0hPa (29.35\u00a0inHg). However, this peak intensity only lasted for 6 hours.[2] Linfa shortly later made landfall to the south of Da Nang, Vietnam near peak strength. As the storm moved over land, its circulation rapidly deteriorated and became partially exposed; the JTWC issued their final advisory on Linfa on 06:00 UTC of October 11.[11] The JMA analyzed that Linfa weakened back to a tropical depression six hours later,[2] however originally they did not issue their final advisory until 18:00 UTC of the same day.[12] The JMA tracked Linfa until it fully dissipated on 12:00 UTC of October 12.[2]"

Shortly after Linfa had moved inland, the storm brought historic amounts of precipitation to Central Vietnam, the peak rainfall total having been 90.16 inches (2,290\u00a0mm) in A L\u01b0\u1edbi (Hu\u1ebf).[17] Several tornadoes were also reported, one which carved through Th\u0103ng B\u00ecnh District, leaving 20 houses unroofed and 2 people missing.[18] 1,009 houses were completely destroyed by Linfa and 121,694 homes in total were damaged by floods.[19] In addition, the floods caused from Linfa damaged 165.5\u00a0km of national highways and 140.1\u00a0km of provincial highways. The storm destroyed 6,989 hectares (17,270 acres) of rice crops and vegetable crops, and 2,141 hectares (5,290 acres) of aquaculture, whilst killing about 685,225 livestock.[20] On the night of 12 to 13 October, when leading the rescue team of workers at a hydropower plant (Thua Thien Hue) to find missing workers buried in a landslide, Major General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Man was buried in yet another landslide with 12 people from the rescue team.[21] On October 15, their bodies were found by rescuers.[22] The entirety of Ly Son Island, an island with a population of over 22,000 people, was left without power.[23] 2 boats near the island were also destroyed, but the men inside were also rescued by two naval ships.[23] The storm left, in total, 112 people dead and 24 missing in Vietnam.[24][25]"

        "content": " Hurricane Marie is tied as the seventh-most intense Pacific hurricane on record, attaining a barometric pressure of 918 mbar (hPa; 27.11\u00a0inHg) in August\u00a02014. The fourteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and sixth major hurricane of the season, Marie began as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean on August 10. Some organization of shower and thunderstorm activity initially took place, but dry air soon impinged upon the system and imparted weakening. The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic and Caribbean for several days. On August\u00a019, an area of low pressure consolidated within the wave west of Central America. With favorable atmospheric conditions, convective activity and banding features increased around the system and by August\u00a022, the system acquired enough organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E while situated about 370\u00a0mi (595\u00a0km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Development was initially fast-paced, as the depression acquired tropical storm-force winds within six\u00a0hours of formation and hurricane-force by August\u00a023. However, due to some vertical wind shear its intensification rate stalled, and for a time it remained a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. On August\u00a024, Marie developed an eye and rapidly intensified to a Category\u00a05 hurricane with winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h).[nb 1] At its peak, the hurricane's gale-force winds spanned an area 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) across. Marie subsequently underwent an eyewall replacement cycle on August\u00a025 which prompted steady weakening. Over the next several days, Marie progressively degraded to below hurricane strength as it moved into an increasingly hostile environment with cooler waters and a more stable atmosphere. On August\u00a029, after having lost all signs of organized deep convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low. The large system gradually wound down over the following several days, with winds subsiding below gale-force on August\u00a030. The remnant cyclone eventually lost a well defined center and dissipated on September\u00a02 about 1,200\u00a0mi (1,950\u00a0km) northeast of Hawaii. Although Marie's center remained well away from land throughout its entire existence, its large size brought increased surf to areas from Southwestern Mexico northward to southern California. Off the coast of Los Cabos, three people drowned after their boat capsized in rough seas. In Colima and Oaxaca, heavy rains from outer bands caused flooding, resulting in two fatalities. Similar effects were felt across Baja California Sur. Toward the end of August, Marie brought one of the largest hurricane-related surf events to southern California in decades. Swells of 10 to 15\u00a0ft (3.0 to 4.6\u00a0m) battered coastal areas, with structural damage occurring on Santa Catalina Island and in the Greater Los Angeles Area. A breakwater near Long Beach sustained $10\u00a0million worth of damage, with portions gouged out. One person drowned in the surf near Malibu. Hundreds of ocean rescues, including over 100 in Malibu alone, were attributed to the storm, and overall losses reached $20\u00a0million.[nb 2]"

        "content": "On August\u00a010, the National Hurricane Center (NHC)[nb 3] began monitoring a westward moving tropical wave emerging off the west coast of Africa, centered along 16\u00b0W.[2][3] Accompanied by disorganized convective activity, development, if any, was expected to be slow.[4] A broad area of low pressure subsequently formed within the wave about halfway between Africa and the Cape Verde Islands.[5] Embedded within an elongated trough,[6] the weak system struggled to organize and convection soon diminished.[7] Interaction with a monsoon trough reinvigorated shower and thunderstorm activity on August\u00a011 across a large area southwest of the Cape Verde Islands,[8] but the surface low had dissipated by this time.[9] Development was no longer expected over the following days as dry air created a hostile area for storm organization.[10] The wave continued westward across the Atlantic and entered the Caribbean on August\u00a016.[11] Subsequent interactions with South America and an upper-level trough inhibited improvement of the system.[2] Beginning on August\u00a017, the NHC anticipated that a low-pressure area would form within five days to the south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec in the East Pacific, with a 30% chance of tropical cyclogenesis.[12] By the next day, the wave was located over Panama, and the NHC upgraded the potential for development to 60%.[13] The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific with accompanying convection,[14] developing a low-pressure area on August\u00a019. Conditions were favorable for further development,[15] and the thunderstorms increased and became better organized on August\u00a020.[16] After an increase in rainbands and outflow around the well-defined center,[17] the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on August\u00a022 about 370\u00a0mi (595\u00a0km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. A strong ridge over the southern United States, later expanding into northern Mexico, steered the system on a west-northwest course throughout its existence as a tropical cyclone.[2] Conditions were favorable for the nascent depression to strengthen. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model predicted the system would become a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale when the system was only a tropical depression.[17] Only six hours after the NHC issued its first advisory the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Marie, the thirteenth named storm of the 2014 season.[19] The storm very quickly organized, developing a central dense overcast consisting of intense convection;[20] this was aided by warm water temperatures and low wind shear. On August\u00a023, the NHC upgraded Marie to hurricane status,[21] and an eye began forming later that day.[22] On the next day, as the storm rapidly intensified, the eye became much more distinct and was surrounded by a powerful eyewall.[23] During this phase the storm wobbled, shifting due west before resuming its previous motion. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a024, Marie attained Category\u00a05 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, the first such Pacific hurricane since Celia in 2010.[2] The NHC estimated peak sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), based on a Dvorak T-number of 7.0 provided by TAFB and SAB. They also estimated Marie's minimum barometric pressure at 918 mbar (hPa; 27.11\u00a0inHg), ranking as the seventh-strongest in the Pacific east of the International Date Line since records began in 1949.[2][18][nb 4] Coincidentally, Hurricane Odile attained the same pressure just three weeks later.[24] At its peak, Marie was a large hurricane with tropical storm-force winds covering an area 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) across.[2][25] Shortly after Marie attained peak intensity, the convection weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, in which an outer eye formed.[26] The storm also weakened due to gradually decreasing water temperatures. By early on August\u00a026, the eye became much less defined.[27] The double eye feature persisted through that day, although the outer eyewall opened up as thunderstorms weakened further.[28] Late on August\u00a027, Marie weakened to tropical storm status, by which time the circulation became exposed from the convection.[29] A strengthening ridge near California caused the storm to accelerate more to the west-northwest, into an area of cooler waters and dry air.[30] Failing to produce any additional convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low late on August\u00a028.[2] The residual circulation gradually wound down as it continued northwest. Through August\u00a029, the system continued to produce gale-force winds.[2][31] Turning west and later west-southwest within a weak easterly flow, Marie slowly moved across the open Pacific while remaining a broad, weak cyclone. The former cyclone eventually lost a well-defined center and dissipated on September\u00a02, about 1,200\u00a0mi (1,950\u00a0km) northeast of Hawaii.[2]"

A portion of Federal Highway 200 and a bridge were closed.[34] Approximately 10,000\u00a0people were in need of assistance and a disaster declaration was requested for the state of Oaxaca.[35] Storm surge in Colima destroyed four buildings and damaged ten more.[36] Flooding along the Marabasco and San Nicol\u00e1s rivers resulted in two fatalities.[37] Minor flooding also occurred near Acapulco and in Colima where 16\u00a0ft (4.9\u00a0m) waves pounded the coast.[38][39] In Guadalajara, numerous trees were downed and 12 shops were closed.[40] Off the coast of Los Cabos in Baja California Sur, large swells capsized a fishing boat with seven people aboard on August\u00a025. Four were able to swim back to shore while the other three remained missing and were later presumed dead.[2][33] Strong rain bands along the outer fringes of Hurricane Marie brought heavy rain to parts of the state.

Forecasters at the local National Weather Service office warned residents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties could \"potentially see the largest surf in recent years generated by a hurricane.\"[42] Swells of 10 to 15\u00a0ft (3.0 to 4.6\u00a0m) were anticipated with the risk of coastal flooding and structural damage. Advisories were also issued for Orange and Santa Barbara counties.[42][43] Surf in the region ultimately reached 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) along south-facing shores while west-facing beaches only saw waves up to 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m).[44] The combination of large swells, high tide, and powerful south-to-north longshore currents impeded by the bight formed by the Palos Verdes Peninsula resulted in significant coastal flooding in Seal Beach. A four-block area of oceanfront property was affected; several apartments were left with inches of water on the ground floor.[45] Severe beach erosion resulted in the loss of 10,000\u201320,000\u00a0yd3 (7,600\u201315,200\u00a0m3) of sand; a state of emergency was declared to assist with restoration efforts.[46] Near Malibu Pier, several surfers were caught in the rough swells and knocked into each other; one struck a rock,  was knocked unconscious, and drowned.[47] Malibu Pier itself sustained some damage and a lifeguard house built in the 1950s was destroyed.[48] North of Malibu, one structure fell into the ocean.[49] The Los Angeles County Fire Department assisted with over 115\u00a0ocean rescues on August\u00a026.[50] More than 170\u00a0rescues were made the following day, including 73 at the famous surfing spot \"The Wedge\" in Newport Beach.[51] Significant flooding also occurred in and around the Port of Long Beach.[45] The Army Corps of Engineers was sent out to inspect significant damage to the middle breakwater at Long Beach.[52] Eleven sections of the breakwater sustained major damage, including three areas which were completely gouged out.[53][54] Along the 18,500\u00a0ft (5,600\u00a0m) breakwater,[55] 1,550\u00a0ft (470\u00a0m) of it sustained major damage, 850\u00a0ft (260\u00a0m) saw significant damage, and a further 1,725\u00a0ft (526\u00a0m) experienced moderate damage.[56] Several hundred tons of rock were estimated to have been dislodged by the storm. The nearby San Pedro and Long Beach breakwaters saw substantial damage as well, though not as severe as the middle breakwater.[53] Debris from the Navy Mole breakwater damaged a roadway near the Sea Launch Commander, within Long Beach.[52] The breach resulted in roughly $3\u00a0million in damage to nearby terminals.[57] Two barges and a pleasure craft were loosed from their anchors by the surging waves and had to be towed back. Two terminals had to close due to dangerous conditions for workers.[58] Less than two weeks after Marie, Hurricane Norbert threatened to bring further increased surf to the area. With the breakwater yet to be repaired, a large sand berm was reinforced along beaches and residents were supplied with sandbags.[59] The Army Corps estimated that it would take more than $20\u00a0million to repair just the major breaches along the middle breakwater.[53]  On September\u00a018 Connolly-Pacific Co. was contracted for $5m to repair the twelve worst affected areas of the breakwaters and construction began on October\u00a08. An estimated 20,000\u201330,000\u00a0tons of rock would be used in the project.[60] A $200,000 repair budget was initially allocated for areas around Navy Mole, including Pier F, J South, and Navy Mole Road; this was later increased to $4\u00a0million by the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners in January 2015.[57] On Santa Catalina Island, boulders estimated to weigh 3,000\u00a0lb (1,400\u00a0kg) were tossed inland by the surf. Substantial damage took place at the Avalon Harbor where many dry-docked boats were knocked off their stands.[45] The harbor was littered with debris for several days, mainly pieces of lumber. A pier at White's Landing was also partially destroyed.[61] A 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m) boat was tossed onshore at Pebbly Beach into Catalina Laundry, the only laundry business on the island. The building and a nearby boatyard were deemed total losses.[62] Damage at the beach was deemed the worst since September 1997 when Hurricane Linda brought large swells to the region.[49][63] The Catalina Express ferry halted service on August\u00a027 due to the rough seas.[58] Damage across Catalina Island was estimated to be $3\u20135\u00a0million.[44] Total losses in California amounted to nearly $20\u00a0million.[2]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Trudy was a short-lived tropical cyclone in October\u00a02014 that caused significant flooding in southern Mexico. The storm originated from an area of low pressure associated with a monsoon trough near Central America in early October. A slow-moving system, the low eventually consolidated into a tropical depression on October\u00a017 near the Mexican coastline. Favorable environmental conditions aided rapid development of Trudy. Within 15\u00a0hours of its designation, an eye formed over the storm's center. Trudy ultimately achieved its peak intensity as a strong tropical storm with 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) winds as it made landfall just southeast of Marquelia, Mexico. The region's mountainous terrain quickly weakened Trudy and the cyclone dissipated early on October\u00a019. Though the cyclone dissipated, its remnant energy later contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Hanna in the Atlantic. Prior to Trudy's landfall, the Government of Mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for the threatened region. Forecasters highlighted the threat of heavy rains and mudslides. Guerrero experienced the greatest effects from Trudy, with landslides and flooding claiming eight lives in the state. Over 4,000\u00a0people were evacuated in the region. A ninth fatality took place in Campeche."

        "content": "On October\u00a08, a weak area of low pressure developed within a monsoon trough over the extreme eastern edge of the Pacific basin. Environmental conditions ahead of the system were forecast to become gradually favorable for tropical cyclogenesis.[1] Situated near Costa Rica, scattered convection accompanied the well-defined system.[2] This low became less defined over the following days while remaining in the same general area.[3] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system for long-term cyclogenesis on October\u00a013, at which time the low was situated 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) south of Guatemala.[4] Organization was prolonged and slow;[5] however, the convergence of a Kelvin wave and a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event on October\u00a015 spurred a significant increase in convection.[6] Marked structural improvements took place on October\u00a017 and the NHC assessed a high probability of the system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48\u00a0hours.[7] That evening, corroborating data from ships, satellite imagery, and scatterometer estimates indicated the formation of a tropical depression by 12:00\u00a0UTC.[6] With the cyclone located over warm waters of 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C) and within a very moist region with low wind shear, intensification was a certainty as the depression approached Mexico. Uncertainties existed as to how fast the system would move. Some forecast models depicting the system as stalling just offshore for several days, though forecasters indicated that a steady northward movement would lead to dissipation within 48\u00a0hours.[8] Owing to the aforementioned environmental conditions, the depression intensified to a tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a017;[6] it was subsequently assigned the name Trudy by the NHC. Very deep convection blossomed over both the center and accompanying banding features.[9] During the morning of October\u00a018, a central dense overcast became increasingly defined; microwave satellite imagery and coastal radars depicted the formation of a 12 to 17\u00a0mi (19 to 27\u00a0km) wide eye by 03:00\u00a0UTC.[6][10] It is estimated that Trudy reached its peak intensity around 09:15\u00a0UTC on October\u00a018 with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.47\u00a0inHg). Simultaneously the storm made landfall just southeast of Marquelia, or roughly 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) east of Acapulco.[6] Interaction with the mountainous terrain of Mexico quickly took its toll on Trudy,[11] with the system degrading to a tropical depression by 18:00\u00a0UTC. The low-level circulation of the depression dissipated early on October\u00a019, with its mid-level remnants continuing northeastward over Mexico. The remnant system emerged over the Bay of Campeche on October\u00a020 and subsequently developed into Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine\u2014which later became Tropical Storm Hanna\u2014on October\u00a022. Due to the dissipation of its surface low, Trudy and Hanna are considered separate tropical cyclones by the NHC.[6]"

        "content": "Upon the designation of Tropical Depression Twenty-E on October\u00a017, a tropical storm warning was issued for coastal areas of Mexico between Tecp\u00e1n de Galeana and Lagunas de Chacahua. Forecasters at the NHC noted that the greatest threat from the system would be torrential rains across Guerrero and Oaxaca that could trigger life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.[12] Rapid organization of the system prompted a hurricane watch to be issued by 09:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a018 for areas between Acapulco and Lagunas de Chacahua. This watch was soon discontinued as Trudy failed to reach hurricane intensity before moving inland over Mexico. The tropical storm warning was subsequently allowed to expire by 21:00\u00a0UTC as Trudy weakened to a depression.[6] In addition to the above watches and warnings, a \"yellow\" alert was activated for Guerrero on October 17.[13] Upon abruptly intensifying prior to landfall, a \"red\" alert was activated for southeastern Guerrero and southwestern Oaxaca while the rest of Guerrero and Oaxaca were placed under an \"orange\" alert.[14] A total of 35 shelters were opened across eastern areas of Guerrero.[15] Heavy rains across Guerrero wreaked havoc, causing widespread flooding and damage.[16] A total of 4,075\u00a0people were evacuated from the most at-risk areas in the state.[17] A further 300\u00a0residents were urged to leave as a river threatened to over-top its banks. Wall collapses attributed to the storm resulted in four deaths: three in Ometepec and one in Cochoapa el Grande.[16] A landslide in Tlacoachistlahuaca killed two people.[18] Road access to 16\u00a0towns was cut off and the main road to Acapulco was damaged by landslides and flooding.[16] Approximately 5,000\u00a0homes were affected by the storm, with 218\u00a0damaged by flooding and 6\u00a0destroyed.[17] More than 20,000\u00a0households lost power due to the storm, though the vast majority was restored within a day.[19] Oaxaca experienced similar impacts to Guerrero, with flooding and landslides mostly causing damage to road infrastructure. Notably, a 39\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) bridge in San Mart\u00edn Peras collapsed, leaving several villages isolated.[20] At least 160\u00a0ft (50\u00a0m) of Mexican Federal Highway 125 was washed away, requiring a repair bill of 8\u00a0million pesos (US$592,000).[21] An emergency declaration was made for 100\u00a0municipalities in Oaxaca.[22] Insurance claims in the state were topped at 158\u00a0million pesos (US$11.7\u00a0million).[23] Trudy was also blamed for one death in Campeche.[24]"

Over the next few days, it moved westwards within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear, before as it passed over the Malay Peninsula, it moved out of the Western Pacific Basin on October 6. It emerged into the Andaman Sea during the next day and moved west-northwest into an improving environment for further development before the system was named Phailin on October 9, after it had developed into a cyclonic storm and passed over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands into the Bay of Bengal. During the next day, Phailin intensified rapidly and became a very severe cyclonic storm on October 10, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). On October 11, the system became equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the SSHWS, before it started to weaken during the next day, as it approached the Indian state of Odisha. It made landfall later that day, near Gopalpur in Odisha coast, at around 22:30\u00a0IST (17:00\u00a0UTC) on October 12. Phailin subsequently weakened over land (becoming a Category 1 tropical cyclone) as a result of frictional forces, before it was last noted on October 14, as it degenerated into a well-marked area of low pressure. Officials from Odisha's state government said that around 12 million people may be affected. The cyclone prompted India's biggest evacuation in 23 years with more than 550,000 people moved up from the coastline in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh to safer places.[3] Total losses were estimated at \u20b9260\u00a0billion (US$4.26\u00a0billion) from the storm."

The IMD reported that the system had intensified into a cyclonic storm and named it Phailin.[15][16] After it was named, Phailin rapidly intensified further, and became the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) early on October 10. After bands of atmospheric convection had wrapped into the systems low level circulation center and formed an eye feature.[17][18] Later that day, the IMD reported that the system had become a very severe cyclonic storm, before the JTWC reported that Phailin had become equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS, after it had rapidly intensified throughout that day.[19][20] Early the next day the system underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and formed a new eyewall which subsequently consolidated.[21] After the new eyewall had consolidated the system slightly intensified further, with the JTWC reporting that the system had reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) which made it equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the SSHWS.[22][23] Early on October 12, the system started to weaken as it underwent a second eyewall replacement cycle, before Phailin's eye started to rapidly deteriorate as it moved towards the Indian coast.[24][25] The system subsequently made landfall later that day near Gopalpur in Odisha, at around 22:30\u00a0IST (17:00\u00a0UTC), near peak intensity.[11] After the system made landfall, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Phailin; on the next day, the IMD reported that the system had weakened into a cyclonic storm. On October 14, Phailin weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area, and the IMD issued their final advisory on the storm.[26][27]"

        "content": "Early on August 8, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that a tropical disturbance had developed north of Yap.[1] During that day, the system moved westwards and consolidated within a favourable environment of weak vertical wind shear and strong outflow, which was enhanced by a TUTT Cell located to the northwest of the disturbance.[2][3] As a result, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), JTWC and PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression 11W north of Palau, with the latter naming it Labuyo as it approached the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[4][5][6] During the next day, JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the latter naming it as Utor (1311).[4][7] Shortly thereafter, Utor began undergoing explosive intensification, achieving typhoon status early on August\u00a010, as an eye developed.[8] On August 11, under the influence of low vertical wind shear, very favourable poleward and westward outflow, and warm sea surface temperature, Utor began to intensify more and formed a clear eye.[9] At 12:00 UTC, Typhoon Utor attained peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 105 knots (195\u00a0km/h, 120\u00a0mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to 925\u00a0hPa (27.3\u00a0inHg). The system became exceptionally symmetrical, as the convective bands had further deepened and wrapped tighter around a 13 nautical miles (24\u00a0km; 15\u00a0mi) pin-hole eye, prompting JTWC upgrading Utor to a super typhoon.[10] Due to land interaction with Luzon, the pin-hole eye filled in quickly; as a result, JTWC downgraded Utor to a typhoon at 18:00 UTC.[11] Tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north, Utor made landfall over northern Luzon around 19:00 UTC (03:00 PHT on August 12).[12] Owing to peaks of western Luzon, Utor significantly weakened as the deep convection became disorganised. Early on August 12, Utor arrived at the South China Sea, where the environment southwest of an anticyclone was favourable with diffluence aloft, light vertical wind shear and excellent radial outflow.[13] Although a ragged eye had formed later that day, the typhoon did not restrengthen further when tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge.[14] On August 13, the eye of Utor had become well-defined on the visible satellite imagery, but the intensity and structure remained when the system was tracking northwestward.[15] At 07:50 UTC (15:50 CST) on August 14, Utor made landfall over Yangxi County in Yangjiang, Guangdong, China as a minimal typhoon.[16] At 12:00 UTC, JMA downgraded Utor to a severe tropical storm, shortly before JTWC issued a final warning to the rapidly weakening system due to land interaction.[17] Later, Utor weakened into a tropical storm overland, and JMA downgraded the system into a tropical depression at noon on August 15. However, the remnants began tracking very slowly in Guangxi, until the tropical depression finally dissipated on August 18.[4]"

Under the anticipation of a direct hit, the local Pangasinan government placed the entire province on red alert. On August 11, the governor announced the suspension of classes from pre-school to tertiary level. Government and private offices were also suspended. Rescue equipment and rubber boats had also been placed in the disaster risk area of the province.[21] In the said regions, the government advised all to not engage in water sports or rough seas due to the anticipated rough seas.[22] Utor made its landfall in Casiguran, Aurora at 3 AM (local time) on August 12. Power lines and telecommunications went down and many houses were destroyed.[23] In Nueva Vizcaya, heavy rainfall had been recorded. Some residents in the said province were forced to evacuate due to flooding. Moreover, the Magat River in the province reached the critical level, resulting in the partial opening of four gates in a dam. Electricity was also out in the province. One man died in Baguio after he had been buried alive after a mudslide hit his home. In Isabela, more than 100 families had been affected by Utor. About 200 million pesos in agriculture was blamed on Utor in Isabela alone. Around 1,000 residents in the central Bicol region spent the night in shelters, and 23 fishermen who were out at sea failed to return home in four towns in Catanduanes province.[24] Some cars in North Luzon Expressway used hazard signals as roads were nearly impossible to see. Intense rainfall throughout the day had been recorded in Zambales, which created flash flooding in low-lying areas. The major river in the province then overflowed, flooding homes. The flooding was expected to rise as high tide was expected in the morning.[25] At least 700 passengers were stranded in the ports of Albay, Catanduanes, Sorsogon and Samar. Additionally, 10 flights had also been canceled as Utor brought intense rainfall in many parts of Luzon.[26] Throughout the Philippines, 11 people were killed while four others were listed as missing. A total of 407,493\u00a0people were affected by the typhoon, roughly a third of whom were displaced from their homes. Significant infrastructural damage took place with 2,592\u00a0homes destroyed and 21,197\u00a0more damaged. Losses from Utor amounted to \u20b11.58 billion (US$36.4 million), the majority resulting from agricultural damage.[27]"

        "content": " Typhoon Fitow, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Quedan, was the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Mainland China during October since 1949. The 21st named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Fitow developed on September\u00a029 to the east of the Philippines. It initially tracked north-northwestward, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm and later to typhoon status, or with winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Fitow later turned more to the west-northwest due to an intensifying ridge to the east, bringing the typhoon over the Ryukyu Islands with peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) on October\u00a05. The next day, the typhoon struck China at Fuding in Fujian province. Fitow quickly weakened over land, dissipating on October\u00a07. Across its path, Fitow spurred many airlines to cancel flights and caused other transport disruptions. In Japan, the typhoon damaged 1,464\u00a0houses and left about 6,800\u00a0households without power on Miyako-jima. Heavy rainfall in Taiwan flooded houses and caused mudslides that closed two highways. Damage was heaviest in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces in China near where Fitow struck. In the latter province, rainfall peaked at 803\u00a0mm (31.6\u00a0in) in Yuyao, which flooded 70% of the town with up to 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) of waters; as a result, the floods were the worst in a century for Yuyao, which disrupted aid distribution in the storm's aftermath. Across China, Fitow damaged about 95,000\u00a0houses and left at least 159,000\u00a0other houses without power. The storm also flooded about 75,000 hectares (190,000 acres) of fields and killed thousands of fish at fish farms. The damage in the country reached \u00a563.14\u00a0billion (2013\u00a0RMB, $10.3\u00a0billion USD),[nb 1] of which \u00a56\u00a0billion (RMB, US$1\u00a0billion) was from insured losses, totaling up to \u00a569.14 billion (RMB, $10.4 billion in 2013 USD), making it, at the time, the costliest event on record until it was surpassed by Typhoon Doksuri in 2023. There were also 12\u00a0deaths in China, eight of them related to electrocutions."

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Fitow were from a persistent area of convection, or thunderstorms, about 310 kilometres (190 miles) north-northeast of Palau, an island in the western Pacific Ocean during mid-late September. At the time, wind shear dislocated the convection to the west of a broad and poorly-defined circulation. Although the system was poorly organized, tropical cyclone forecast models noted the potential for development to occur.[2] The convection gradually consolidated and outflow increased to the west, indicative of increased organization.[3] Early on September\u00a029, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] declared that a tropical depression formed about 310\u00a0km (195\u00a0mi) to the northeast of Palau.[5] Around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began issuing warnings on the depression, giving it the local name Quedan.[6] Early on September\u00a030, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 22W, noting that the circulation had become increasingly well-defined amid decreasing wind shear.[8] With a ridge to the east, the system tracked to the north-northwest through an area of warm water temperatures.[8] At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Fitow.[9] Although outflow and convection increased in general, the thunderstorm activity diminished over the center due to sinking air.[10] By late on October\u00a01, however, convection increased over Fitow's center,[11] and the next day the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm.[5] On October\u00a02, an eye began developing on satellite imagery,[12] although the rainbands wrapping into the eye were fragmented.[13] It took until midday on October\u00a03 for the JTWC to upgrade Fitow to typhoon status, with 1\u2013minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). By that time, the convection had increased in coverage and intensity, with outflow increased by a trough to the north.[14] The JMA did not follow suit until 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04,[5] by which time the eye had become better defined.[15] After officially becoming a typhoon, Fitow turned more to the northwest due to the ridge building to the east. Despite increasing wind shear, the typhoon continued to intensify due to amplified outflow.[15] Late on October\u00a04, the JMA upgraded Fitow to peak 10\u2013minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[5] Early the next day, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u2013minute winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h),[16] and shortly thereafter the typhoon passed about 225\u00a0km (140\u00a0mph) south of Okinawa. By that time, the eye had expanded to 75\u00a0km (47\u00a0mi), which initially remained unaffected by the increased wind shear.[17] Also on October\u00a05, PAGASA issued the final advisory as the storm exited the agency's area of responsibility.[18] Around 1500\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05, Fitow passed about 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Miyako-jima, by which time the eye began deteriorating.[19] As the typhoon passed northeast of Taiwan, the ragged eye became cloud-filled and the convection weakened.[20] Late on October\u00a06, Fitow made landfall just south of Wenzhou in eastern China,[21] at Fuding in Fujian province.[22] Fitow became the strongest China typhoon landfall for the month since 1949 according to the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), with a landfall pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg) and sustained winds of 151\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph).[22] While continuing northwestward near the border of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, Fitow rapidly weakened, dissipating on October\u00a07.[5]"

In the city, about 100,000\u00a0people were forced to evacuate, with 289\u00a0temporary shelters opened.[41] Damage in the city alone totaled about \u00a520\u00a0billion (RMB, US$3.27\u00a0billion).[42] In Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang, Fitow wrecked 26,180\u00a0houses and damaged local fish farms, killing 51,000\u00a0tons of fish. The storm forced 18,134\u00a0factories to shut down, and there were also power and telecommunication outages.[43] In Shanghai, high waters along the Huangpu River damaged a portion of a flood prevention wall.[37] Rainfall caused several matches to be canceled at the 2013 Shanghai Masters.[44] Flooding closed the city zoo and 60\u00a0parks,[45] and entered 600\u00a0houses.[46] In Cangnan County in Wenzhou, Fitow wrecked 1,200\u00a0houses, and throughout Wenzhou, two people died \u2013 one after being blown off a hill, and the other trapped under collapsed rubble.[25] High winds left 254,746\u00a0people in Zhejiang without power, and eight people died in the province from electrocutions. Another two people died after driving into a flooded river.[47] Throughout China, Fitow damaged or destroyed 95,000\u00a0houses.[33]"

Many cleared mudslides from roads, repaired dams, and helped people leave flooded homes.[48] In Tongxiang in Zhejiang province, thousands of people blocked a highway in protest for not receiving aid, prompting the riot police to break up the gathering. The town did not receive supplies other than water tanks, due to it being designated a \"self-rescuing area\" according to a local official.[49] Ping An Insurance received insurance claims for 11,348\u00a0flooded cars in the days after the storm.[50] The storm caused slight delays to shipping in Ningbo and Shanghai.[51] The Chinese Ministry of Finance and Civil Affairs allocated \u00a5118\u00a0million (US$19.3\u00a0million) in funding for Zhejiang and Fujian provinces after the storm.[52] In general, local governments assisted the affected storm victims by providing food, water, and clothing, even traveling by canoe to distribute aid. However, residents in Yuyao complained about insufficient assistance, as many people were without food or clean water for several days,[39] due to ongoing flooding making distribution difficult.[41] This sparked thousands of people to protest the government, although they dispersed after increased numbers of policemen.[53] Residents were initially required to show food coupons to receive meals, but later anyone with a residence permit could receive the meals; however, the food distribution was disorganized, and there were reports of people looting for food.[38] By October\u00a018, the flooding in Yuyao had subsided and roadways had reopened,[35] and power service was gradually restored. Due to the extended disruptions to the city, garbage service was halted.[38] Two people in Yuyao were arrested after spreading false rumors online that reservoir collapsed during the storm, killing 40\u00a0people.[54]"

The system originated from a tropical depression well to the east of Guam on October\u00a08. Tracking generally westward, development of the depression was initially slow; however, on October\u00a011, favorable atmospheric conditions allowed for rapid intensification. The depression strengthened to a tropical storm that day, receiving the name Wipha at the time, and reached typhoon status on October\u00a012. Now moving northwestward, Wipha grew into a very large system and ultimately attained its peak intensity on October\u00a014 with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) and an atmospheric pressure of 930\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.46\u00a0inHg). Accelerating and turning more northerly, the typhoon weakened as conditions became less conducive for tropical cyclones. Wipha dramatically accelerated northeastward on October\u00a015 as it interacted with a stalled out front over Japan. Simultaneously, the storm began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, a process which it completed early on October\u00a016."

Later on, the JMA classified Wipha as a severe tropical storm when it strengthened on October 11, and later on October 12, 2013, Wipha intensified into a typhoon.[citation needed] As it was slowly moving, Wipha entered an area of warm waters and low wind shear. Due to this, the cyclone rapidly intensified into a minimal category 4 typhoon. As it did, Wipha developed a compact, small, clear eye. On the noon of October 14, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, also known as PAGASA, noticed that Wipha had entered the Philippine area of responsibility. As it did, it received the Philippine name Tino.[6] As it weakened into a category 3 typhoon, then into a category 2 typhoon, Wipha left PAGASA's area of responsibility . Early on October 15, Wipha rapidly enfeebled as the ocean waters surrounding the typhoon began to cool as it approached Japan with category 1 status.[7] As it came closer, it dumped very heavy rain in many areas of East Japan, killing 25. Afterwards, it was then reported that an additional 16 people perished due to landslides and flashfloods.[8]The storm reached extratropical status late on October 16. The remnants of Wipha continued to be extratropical as it was located southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula on October 17.[citation needed] As it continued to speed up, Wipha's extratropical remnant low was last noted by the JMA during October 18, after it had crossed the international dateline and moved out of the JMA's area of responsibility.[4]"

Significant disruptions to transportation took place, with over 60,000\u00a0people having their flights canceled and train service in parts of the city was suspended. Cosmo Oil, Fuji Oil, Idemitsu Kosan, and JX Holdings suspended shipments in eastern Japan while Nissan Motor cancelled shipments for the day.[10] Typhoon Wipha weakened as it skirted Japan's eastern coastline on October 15. Though the storm caused only limited damage on the mainland, it spawned a massive landslide on the island of Izu \u014cshima, killing at least 31 and leaving 13 others missing.[11] In addition, a woman was killed in western Tokyo, and the body of one of two schoolchildren who went missing near Kanagawa was later found. A man in Chiba and the other child were still reported missing, in addition to the victims on Oshima.[12][13] At least 350\u00a0homes were destroyed throughout Japan, mostly on Izu \u014cshima.[14] At the Fukushima Daiichi plant, 12\u00a0water storage tanks overflowed from the typhoon's heavy rains. Beta radiation levels skyrocketed to 400,000\u00a0becquerels in the wake of the storm, 6,500\u00a0times greater than prior to Wipha. The overflow was blamed on TEPCO's inadequate preparation and not heeding warnings of the storm. In addition, beta radiation was detected in areas beyond the levees designed to hold back contaminated water.[15] On October\u00a024, it was announced that radiation levels in water near the Fukushima nuclear plant reached an all-time high of 140,000\u00a0becquerels, greatly surpassing the previous peak of 59,000\u00a0becquerels. The spike in radiation is at least partially attributed to torrential rains from Typhoon Wipha.[9]"

The 25th named storm and the 10th typhoon of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Francisco formed on October\u00a016 east of Guam from a pre-existing area of convection. With favorable conditions, it quickly intensified into a tropical storm before passing south of Guam. After stalling to the southwest of the island, Francisco turned to the northwest into an environment of warm waters and low wind shear, becoming a typhoon. The JTWC upgraded it to super typhoon status on October\u00a018, while the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph). Gradual weakening ensued, and after the typhoon turned to the northeast, Francisco deteriorated into a tropical storm on October\u00a024. Passing southeast of Okinawa and mainland Japan, the storm accelerated and became extratropical on October\u00a026, dissipating later that day. On Guam and in the Northern Marianas Islands, Francisco produced tropical storm force wind gusts, strong enough to knock over some trees and cause $150,000 (2013\u00a0USD) in damage. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall on Guam, peaking at 201\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) at Inarajan. Later, Francisco brought gusty winds and some rainfall to Okinawa.

        "content": "Early on October\u00a015, an area of convection persisted about 750\u00a0km (470\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Guam. Initially the system was located within an area of moderate wind shear, although conditions gradually became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis.[1] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 1] estimated that a tropical depression developed about 450\u00a0km (280\u00a0mi) east of Guam.[3] A few hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] issued a tropical cyclone formation alert before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 26W early on October\u00a016.[5][6] At that time, the depression was passing about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) southeast of Guam. After formation, the system moved west-southwestward under a ridge to the north. Its circulation consolidated as the thunderstorm activity organized, aided by warm sea surface temperatures and decreasing wind shear.[6] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Francisco (1327).[3] As a quickly organizing tropical cyclone, Francisco developed an eye-like feature late on October\u00a016 in the center of the convection, as outflow improved and an anticyclone formed aloft.[7][8] Based on the improved structure, the JMA upgraded Francisco to a severe tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016, followed by upgrading it to typhoon status at 06:00\u00a0UTC the next day.[3] Francisco slowed its forward motion as steering currents weakened,[7] with a north-northwest drift beginning on October\u00a017 due to an extension of the subtropical ridge.[8] By later that day, the typhoon had a well-defined eye 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) across and surrounded by deep convection, while passing west of Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands.[9] The track accelerated more to the northwest, steered by the strengthening ridge.[10] With the eyewall convection become more distinct, Francisco continued to intensify, and the JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon on October\u00a018.[11] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the JMA estimated the typhoon attained peak 10-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph).[3] On October\u00a019, the JTWC upgraded Francisco to peak 1\u2011minute winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), the equivalent of a Category\u00a05 on the Saffir-Simpson scale; by that time, the eyewall contracted to just 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) in diameter.[12] After maintaining its peak intensity for about 36\u00a0hours, Francisco began weakening,[3] after the eye lost definition due to building wind shear.[13] By October\u00a021, the eye became ragged and cloud-filled while the overall satellite presentation of the storm became elongated.[14] That day, the typhoon entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which gave Francisco the local name Urduja;[15] the agency would cease issuing advisories on October\u00a023.[16] Conditions generally remained favorable, allowing the eye to remain distinct despite a great reduction in the sustained winds.[17] Dry air began affecting the tropical cyclone late on October\u00a022, cutting off the flow of moist air, and water temperatures cooled along the storm's track.[18] As a result, the eye dissipated and the convection weakened.[19] An approaching trough from the Korean peninsula weakened the ridge to the north, slowing the typhoon and allowing it to turn north and northeast on October\u00a024.[20] Francisco weakened below typhoon status after passing 210\u00a0km (130\u00a0mi) southeast of Okinawa.[3][21] The storm began interacting with the approaching cold front while it passed south of Japan, moving around the subtropical ridge. With increasing wind shear, the circulation became exposed from the convection,[22] and the JTWC discontinued advisories on October\u00a025, declaring that Francisco was becoming extratropical.[23] On the next day, Francisco completed its extratropical transition, but dissipated later on October\u00a026, to the southeast of Japan.[3]"

On Guam, 1,223\u00a0people evacuated to nine schools serving as emergency shelters.[24] A cross country invitational was delayed by one day due to the storm.[25]  As a developing system, Francisco passed south of Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. Gusts on Guam reached 84\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph) at Andersen Air Force Base, while Saipan and Rota reported winds of 63 and 61\u00a0km/h (39 and 38\u00a0mph), respectively. Wind gusts were not as strong when the typhoon approached the islands for a second time. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall on Guam, peaking at 201\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) at Inarajan. Damage in the region totaled $150,000 (2013\u00a0USD), and was largely limited to fallen trees.[24] There was a power outage on Guam during the storm, but the Guam Power Authority was able to quickly restore service; this was due to the first usage of newly installed meters that showed exactly where the cuts had occurred.[26] Later, while passing near Okinawa, Francisco brought gusty winds and some rainfall. The threat of the storm prompted organizers to cancel a tennis tournament in Kant\u014d.[27][28] The looming storm also forced the Japanese refiner company Nansei Sekiyu KK to suspend some marine operations at its facility on Okinawa.[29] After the storm, about 100\u00a0United States military on the island helped clear debris and sand from the road.[30] Unsettled weather from the typhoon caused an Oita Heat Devils basketball game to be canceled.[31] Francisco's gusty winds left about 3,800\u00a0homes without power in Kagoshima Prefecture.[32] Heavy rainfall occurred across Shikoku, including a 48\u2011hour total of about 600\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) at Niyodogawa, K\u014dchi.[33] On Izu \u014cshima, officials advised all 8,365\u00a0residents to evacuate, the first such advisory in 27\u00a0years. About 1,300\u00a0people were under mandatory evacuation orders.

With the warm waters of the Philippine Sea, lessening wind shear, and improving outflow, Krosa gradually strengthened,[7] and the JTWC also upgraded Krosa to tropical storm status on October\u00a030 after an eye feature developed.[8] While approaching northern Luzon on October\u00a029, Krosa quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well-defined eye. Late on October\u00a030, the JTWC upgraded Krosa to typhoon status,[9] and the next day, both PAGASA and JMA followed suit.[10][11] On October\u00a031, Krosa made landfall in northeastern Luzon near Cagayan,[12] and developed a symmetric eyewall while initially moving over land.[13] Land interaction weakened the eye by the time Krosa emerged into the South China Sea late on October\u00a031.[14] The next day, PAGASA discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region.[15] Convection rebuilt around the center, with continued favorable conditions allowing for restrengthening.[16] Late on November\u00a01, a large eye redeveloped, and the JTWC estimated Krosa attained peak 1\u00a0minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[17] Early the next day, the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[2] Later, increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate, and Krosa began slowing about 260\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Hong Kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge.[18] After remaining nearly stationary, Krosa began moving steadily to the west-southwest due to a new ridge.[19] The convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from upwelling,[20] and Krosa deteriorated to tropical storm status on November\u00a03.[21] The next day, the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection.[22] Also on November\u00a04, the JMA downgraded Krosa to tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast. The system dissipated at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a05.[2]"

The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides.[12] High winds knocked down trees across Luzon,[23] and left about 80% of Cagayan province without power,[24] as well as some areas without internet or cellphone service. Portions of the Pan-Philippine Highway were blocked, and in Lal-Lo, Cagayan, a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages.[25] Agriculture damage was estimated at \u20b1273\u00a0million (US$6.31\u00a0million),[26][nb 4] occurring just before the start of the harvest.[25] Across the island, the typhoon damaged 37,523\u00a0houses, including 3,897 that were destroyed,[26] forcing 65,648\u00a0people to evacuate to storm shelters. Overall, Krosa killed four people in the Philippines, and left \u20b1277\u00a0million (US$6.4\u00a0million) in damage.[26][nb 4] After the storm, workers quickly restored power lines, while the government provided monetary assistance to storm-ravaged families,[28] after Cagayan was declared a state of calamity. Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm.[29] The China National Meteorological Centre issued a \"yellow alert\", the second-lowest of the four level warning system, for Hainan due to the threat of the storm. The agency recommended boats to return to port.[30] Agencies in Vietnam also warned for the potential of heavy rainfall due to the dissipating Tropical Depression Krosa,[31] and released water from three dams to prevent overflow.[32]"

The lands that include Lincoln County and Fayetteville were originally part of Cherokee and Chickasaw land.  They were ceded to the United States in 1806. The city was named for Fayetteville, North Carolina, where some of its earliest residents had lived before moving to Tennessee. The earlier town was named for Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, a French general who fought for the United States during the American Revolution. Lincoln County was named for Major General Benjamin Lincoln, second in command of the U.S. Army at the end of the Revolutionary War. The earliest white settler was Ezekiel Norris, who gave the one hundred acres upon which the city was built. In addition to Ezekiel Norris, other founding fathers of Fayetteville include: Alexander and Andrew Greer, William Edmonson, and Matthew Buchanan. In 1995, the International Gospel Hour radio broadcast, founded in Texarkana, Texas, by the clergyman V. E. Howard was transferred to the West Fayetteville Church of Christ in Fayetteville under the minister Winford Claiborne.[7]"

Situated south of a ridge, the system tracked west-northwest through a region of low wind shear and good upper-level divergence.[4] Late on November\u00a026, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Durian by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 1] Steady strengthening took place over the following two days as the system approached the Philippines. After attaining typhoon status on November\u00a029,[5] Durian underwent a period of rapid intensification,[4] culminating with it attaining peak 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a central barometric pressure of 915\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.02\u00a0inHg). Durian brushed the southern coast of the Catanduanes at this intensity on November\u00a030, where a record gust of 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph) was observed.[5][6] Slight weakening took place before the storm made landfall in the Bicol Region.[5] Land interaction precipitated further degradation of storm, though it retained typhoon status upon emerging over the South China Sea on December\u00a01,[4] having passed just 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) south of Metro Manila.[7] Some re-intensification occurred, with Durian reaching a secondary peak on December\u00a03. Subsequently, increasingly hostile conditions caused the system to weaken to a severe tropical storm as it turned southwest. The storm had initial intensifies before struck southern Vietnam early on December\u00a05 as a minimal typhoon before diminishing to a tropical depression.[5] The system turned westward once again and crossed the Malay Peninsula.[8] The JMA ceased tracking the storm on December\u00a06 when it crossed west of 100\u00b0\u00a0E and into the North Indian Ocean basin,[5] although the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] continued tracking it through the Bay of Bengal.

The lahars destroyed dykes and dams meant to contain the debris flow,[33] which were not designed to prevent major landslides.[38] Warnings were issued for potential lahars, but the rapid development of the debris flows as well as power outages meant populations did not receive adequate warning. Initially, the lahars were contained by a layer of grasslands, although the unstable nature of the volcanic soil caused the grounds to collapse. Within 21\u00a0minutes, the lahars descended Mayon Volcano, quickly covering and wrecking six communities. After the initial series of lahars, further ash flow descended to the ocean to the north of Mayon Volcano.[33] Areas around the volcano were inundated with 1.5\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft) of floodwaters.[39] Widespread flooding was also reported in Legazpi City.[14] North of Legazpi, the ash flow covered or damaged portions of the Pan-Philippine Highway.[33] In the small barangay \u2013 small town \u2013 of Maipon, nearby streams coalesced into a valley filled with muddy waters. The landslide arrived quickly and washed away or destroyed houses in the path. Several people died while attempting to cross to higher grounds. Similar conditions affected nearby Daraga, where 149\u00a0people died. Around that city, the landslide reached 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) deep and 307\u00a0m (1,007\u00a0ft) wide, enough to cover 3\u00a0story buildings, while floods enlarged the nearby Yawa River by 600%.[10] About 13,000\u00a0families had to leave their homes due to the landslides.[42] Many roads and bridges were wrecked around the volcano, which halted transportation and impacted relief work.[43] In Albay province alone, there were 604\u00a0deaths and 1,465\u00a0people who sustained injuries. Damage in the province totaled $71\u00a0million (USD).[44] The storm also damaged 702 of the 704\u00a0schools in the province.[45]"

        "content": "On December\u00a03, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared a state of national calamity, due to the successive impacts of typhoons Xangsane, Cimaron, and Durian.[13] Arroyo ordered the immediate release of 1\u00a0billion Philippine pesos ($20.7\u00a0million, 2006 USD) for relief in areas affected by typhoons Durian, Xangsane, and Cimaron.[50] This relief fund was increased to 3.6\u00a0billion pesos ($74.8\u00a0million, 2006\u00a0USD) on December 6, including an additional 150\u00a0million pesos ($3.1\u00a0million) for power grid repair.[51] The government used over \u20b1500\u00a0million (PHP) from their Countryside Development Fund.[52] Soon after Durian exited the country, workers began restoring power lines and clearing debris and trees from roads,[16] which was required before relief agencies reached the hardest hit areas.[12] As of December\u00a01, 3,316\u00a0families had fled their homes to storm shelters.[7] Immediately after the storm's landfall, reports of deaths or injuries had not yet reached the media centres.[15] As officials made contact with the hardest hit areas, the death toll quickly rose to 190 by December\u00a01,[12] and to 720 by two weeks later.[53] On December\u00a017, the Philippine government issued a $46\u00a0million appeal to the United Nations for financial assistance coping with Durian.[13] This was after the country already depleted its yearly emergency funding for disasters.[54] In response, various United Nations' departments provided about $2.6\u00a0million in emergency funding, and by late December 2006, 14\u00a0countries had provided donations to the Philippines.[13] By the end of January, only 7.1% of the appeal was raised.[34] By the end of April 2007, four Asian countries \u2013 China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore \u2013 donated \u20b154\u00a0million (US$2.2\u00a0million) worth of emergency supplies, such as clothing, medicine, and food.[55][56] Various companies and local organizations donated to the relief effort, such as medicine, food, water, transport supplies, clothes, and money.[57] Individuals and corporations donated \u20b168\u00a0million (US$1.4\u00a0million) in cash and supplies.[55] The international response came shortly after the calamity status was declared. On December 3, Canada released $1\u00a0million (US$860,000) for local relief through its embassy in Manila and through the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.[50][58] UNICEF donated 4,000 packages containing food, mattresses, and blankets, and UNOCHA donated $1\u2013 2\u00a0million (USD) for relief supplies.[58] Spain donated $250,000 (USD) and sent medical teams, medicines, food, and supplies to affected areas.[59] The United States donated $250,000 plus supplies through the USAID program, and the Filipino community on Saipan contributed cash, food, and supplies.[58] Australia released $1\u00a0million (US$792,000) through its AusAID program.[58] Indonesia sent two C-130 Hercules aircraft to Legazpi City, carrying a total of 25 tons of food, medicine, and clothing valued at 1.17\u00a0billion Indonesian rupiah (US$129,000).[59] Japan pledged tents, blankets, generators, and water management equipment through the Japan International Cooperation Agency.[59] Malaysia donated 20 tons of food and medicines, and Singapore sent two batches of supplies valued at $50,000 (USD) through Singapore Airlines.[58] The Republic of Korea pledged $100,000 (USD) cash, while the People's Republic of China pledged $200,000 (USD).[59] Israel donated $7,500 (USD), mostly in medicines and medical supplies.[59] The Red Cross, which responded to the repeated storms of 2006, launched an appeal that raised $9.67\u00a0million for the Philippines. In March 2009, the agency completed the missions responding to the 2006 storms and transferred the remaining funds to help repair from Typhoon Fengshen in 2008.[60] The International Organization for Migration developed the Humanitarian Response Monitoring System in response to problems in the management of the aftermath of Durian,[61] and also provided 12,750\u00a0metric tons of building supplies, medicine, and water in the storm's immediate aftermath.[62] OXFAM built 242\u00a0latrines and 99\u00a0bath houses to ensure proper hygiene.[45] The Tzu Chi Foundation set up a temporary medical camp in Tabaco to provide free health care to storm victims.[63] The International Labour Organization built a livelihood center in February 2008 to help provide jobs to storm victims.[37] The World Bank, in conjunction with the Philippines' National Power Corporation, funded a $21.6\u00a0million project to repair the damaged power lines in the typhoons' aftermath. The agencies also upgraded 118\u00a0electrical towers by 2008 to stabilize power supply during typhoons. As a result, there were minimal power outages during the passage of Tropical Storm Higos (Pablo) in 2008.[64] Beginning in January 2007, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization distributed about 150\u00a0packs of vegetable seeds and farm tools to displaced residents in three Bicol provinces, as part of the sustainable recovery program planned by the Philippine government for storm victims.[65][41] By a year after the typhoon, farmers had regrown their rice and vegetables, utilizing a rebuilt irrigation system. The World Food Programme supplied fishermen with materials to rebuild damaged boats, allowing them to resume catching fish by May 2007.[41] The agency also provided monthly food rations to displaced residents in Albay,[66] totaling 294\u00a0tons of rice to about 6,000\u00a0families;[67] however, the food distribution programs ended in December 2007, causing food shortages in the first few months of 2008 among those still displaced.[42] UNICEF distributed 1,750\u00a0water purification tablets, along with jerrycans and water containers, to ensure access to clean water.[45] After the successive impacts of Xangsane and Durian caused widespread power outages, the Bicol region lost about $250\u00a0million in economic output.[64] The unemployment rate in the Bicol region rose to about 30%, and many who retained their jobs earned less than before the storm.[37] In the aftermath of Durian, all relief activities were coordinated through the Philippines' departments of Health and Social Welfare and Development. A fleet of over 200\u00a0vehicles transported relief supplies \u2013 food, construction materials, clothing, and medicine \u2013 to the Bicol region on December\u00a012. The Philippine Air Force airlifted supplies and medical teams to Bicol and offshore Catanduanes, with the National Disaster Coordinating Council supplying 17,350\u00a0sacks of rice to those areas. The Departments of Social Welfare and Development and the Department of Health sent teams to help victims cope with stress and consoled the families of the deceased, aided by psychiatrists. The Department of Health also distributed tents and sleeping bags, provided vaccines to people in evacuation camps, and ensured proper burial of storm casualties. There was a minor outbreak of diarrhea in the evacuation camps that affected 142\u00a0people in Legazpi, and other evacuees were also ailed by the cold, coughing, and fever. Local governments in Albay worked to ensure areas retained clean water by using disinfectants and temporary latrines.[13] The Philippine government provided \u20b1119\u00a0million (US$2.4\u00a0million) toward rebuilding the damaged schools in Albay, only 23% of the required cost to repair all of the schools.[45] The government assessed that about 35% of those who lost their houses had the resources to rebuild without assistance; this meant that 144,692\u00a0houses had to be rebuilt.[34] Many of the storm victims left homeless resided in tent camps, schools, and temporary shelters, until more permanent buildings were built.[42][45] The Red Cross housed about 60,000\u00a0people across ten provinces in temporary shelters.[68] The Philippine government planned to quickly build more permanent homes, although there were difficulties in securing land and materials for the new housing. By March 2007, government and international agencies only provided 6.9% of the necessary homes, forcing people to stay in shelters longer than expected.[45] By a year after the storm, over 10,000\u00a0families still stayed in transit camps in Albay and Camarines Sur.[62] Various organizations helped the homeless secure housing. The government of Italy funded a \u20b126\u00a0million (US$525,000) project to rebuild 180\u00a0houses in Albay. The Italian government also helped build new livelihood centers to provide jobs, provided new boats, and donated about 80,000\u00a0coconut seeds to replant trees.[69] In the eight months after Durian struck, the Philippine National Red Cross, in conjunction with the International Red Cross, delivered building supplies to about 12,000\u00a0families to repair their homes or build new ones. The organizations encouraged residents to rebuild houses away from vulnerable areas.[70] The International Organization for Migration, in conjunction with the United States Agency for International Development, built 907\u00a0homes and new community centers.[71] The Philippine government released \u20b176\u00a0million ($1.5\u00a0million) in funds to build 1,089\u00a0houses.[72] UNICEF provided emergency funding to rebuild 50\u00a0daycare centers that were damaged by the typhoon.[73] Habitat for Humanity helped repair about 1,200\u00a0homes,[74] build about 2,000\u00a0new houses, and rebuilt four schools in Sorsogon.[75] Around Mayon Volcano, officials enacted search and rescue missions for victims affected by landslides.[13] Workers quickly excavated lahar-filled valleys, bridges, and river beds to rebuild dykes. Farmers quickly regrew damaged crops, while schools and homes were cleaned and rebuilt. Stronger concrete dykes were built around populated communities.[33] The government developed relocation plans for three landslide-prone areas in Albay.[13] In 2011, the Regional Development Council approved a budget to construct additional dams along the Mayon Volcano to prevent the deadly floods and landslides that occurred during Durian.[76] Dams were scheduled to be constructed around the volcano after a 1981 study, but these were delayed due to budget constraints.[10]"

        "content": " Fort Payne is a city in and county seat of DeKalb County, in northeastern Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 14,877. The city developed around a fort of the same name, built in the 1830s to intern Cherokee people who were being rounded up by the military before being forcibly removed to Indian Territory in 1838 on what they called the Trail of Tears. European-American settlers gradually developed a community around the former fort. It grew rapidly in the late 19th century based on industrial resources, and manufacturing increased in the early 20th century. At the beginning of the 21st century, it still had 7000 workers in 100 mills producing varieties of socks, nearly half the world production. The volume of production has declined because of competition from China."

        "content": "In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, this was the site of Willstown, an important town of the Lower Cherokee. They had moved south along the Tennessee River and into what became Alabama in an effort to escape European-American pressure. For a time this was the home of Sequoyah, a silversmith who by 1821 created the Cherokee syllabary, one of the few writing systems created by an individual from a pre-literate culture.[3] In Alabama, his people soon started publishing the first newspaper in Cherokee and English, The Cherokee Phoenix.[3] This settlement was commonly called Willstown after its headman, Will Weber, who had striking red hair. He was the son of Cherokee and German parents and raised as Cherokee. John Norton, a man born in Scotland about 1770 to Scottish and Cherokee parents, visited this area and other parts of the Cherokee homeland in 1809-1810. He had come to North America as a British soldier and became close to Mohawk people at the Grand River Reserve in Ontario, where he served as an interpreter.[4] During the 1830s prior to Indian removal, the US Army under command of Major John Payne built a fort near Willstown to intern Cherokee from Alabama until they were forcibly removed to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Their forced exile became known as the Trail of Tears. Only a chimney of Fort Payne still stands in the downtown of the city that developed around it."

        "content": "Although European Americans had pressed for Indian removal in the Southeast because they wanted land to cultivate, by the 1860s, the city of Fort Payne and the surrounding area were only sparsely settled. Development of cotton plantations and larger settlements had taken place in the uplands region known as the Black Belt. With no strategic targets nearby, during the Civil War only minor skirmishes between Union and Confederate forces took place here. About the time of the Second Battle of Chattanooga, a large Union force briefly entered the county, but it did not engage substantial Confederate forces.[5][6] In 1878 the city Fort Payne was designated as the county seat, and in 1889 it was incorporated as a town. The community of Lebanon had served as the DeKalb county seat since 1850. With the completion of rail lines between Birmingham and Chattanooga that went through Fort Payne, the city's growth was stimulated by connection to this new transportation route. County sentiment had supported having the seat in a community served by the railroad, seen as key to the future.[6] In the late 1880s, Fort Payne's growth was stimulated after the discovery of coal and iron deposits, needed to support industrialization. Investors and especially workers from New England and the North flooded into the region for new jobs. This period is called the \"Boom Days\", or simply the \"Boom\". Many of the notable historic buildings in Fort Payne date from this period of economic growth and prosperity, including the state's oldest standing theater, the Fort Payne Opera House; the former factory of the Hardware Manufacturing Company (today known as the W. B. Davis Mill Building, now the location of the Fort Payne Depot Museum, and formerly the passenger station for the present-day Norfolk Southern Railway. Following the decline of passenger traffic in the mid-20th century as people took to automobiles, today the depot serves as a museum of local history.[7] The iron and coal deposits were much smaller than expected. Many of the promoters left the region for Birmingham, Alabama, which became the state's major industrial city. Fort Payne suffered a period of economic decline. In 1907, the W.B. Davis Hosiery Mill began operations, processing area cotton to produce socks and hosiery. Hosiery manufacture has led the economy in Fort Payne.[8] At the beginning of the 21st century, the hosiery industry in Fort Payne employed over 7,000 people in more than 100 mills. It produced more than half of the socks made in the United States and claimed to be the \"Sock Capital of the World.\" Beginning in the 1990s, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Central American Free Trade Agreement lowered tariffs on textile products imported into the United States, resulting in large increases in sock imports. By the early 2000s a very large, highly-efficient centre for sock production had grown up around Datang, Zhuji in Zhejiang Province, China. Raw materials and hosiery machines were also manufactured at Datang. While in Fort Payne a company might have to wait two months for a replacement part for a hosiery machine to arrive from Italy, a manufacturer in Datang would have to wait half an hour for the part to arrive from a local company. American multinational retail corporations began to source hosiery products from Datang. The American companies\u2019 strict negotiating positions required the Datang producers to accept as little as 3% profit. As American retail corporations began to source their products from China, Datang became the new \"Sock Capital of the World.\"[9] Many businesses in Fort Payne accused foreign manufacturers, particularly those from China, of engaging in dumping of socks below cost to force American companies out of the sock business. By 2005, hosiery mill employment in Fort Payne had declined to around 5,500, and several mills had closed. In late 2005, the federal government gained an agreement with the Chinese government to slow the schedule for the removal of tariffs, delaying their full removal until 2008.[10][11] The hosiery industry continues to have a foothold in the community, diversifying from athletic socks to boutique designs such as Zkano, and other specialty and medical socks. In the 1990s, facing the international threat to their manufacturing, business and civic leaders in Fort Payne began to take steps to diversify the city's economy. Several new commercial and industrial projects were developed. The largest was the 2006 construction of a distribution center for The Children's Place stores, a facility that employed 600 people in its first phase of operation.[12] Other large corporations represented in Fort Payne include Heil Environmental Industries (a division of Dover Industries, manufacturing sanitation trucks); Vulcraft (a division of Nucor Corporation, manufacturing steel roofing systems); and Game Time (a division of Playcore, manufacturing commercial playground equipment)."

However, it is also likely that the name is related to, or a derivative of, similar place names that do or have existed in other parts of Africa.[speculation?] In colonial times Lake Malawi was known as Lake Nyasa (very similar to 'Knysna'), while Webster's Universal Unabridged Dictionary[7] defines the word 'nyanza' as a noun: \"(African): An expanse of water, as a lake or wide river\".

        "header": "Houtunqua (Outeniqua) Khoe",
        "content": "The indigenous inhabitants of the Knysna area are a southern Khoekhoe people called the Houtunqua or Outeniqua. Their name means \"The People Who Bear Honey\".[10][11] From the Khoekhoegowab words /hao, 'honey', tun'(teni), 'to carry (verb)', and khoe rendered as qua meaning people.[12] Little is known about Houtunqua society prior to European contact. What little historical sources exist are not elaborate. It is suspected that at the height of the Houtunqua's society, their territory stretched from the mouth of the Krom River in the east, along the Outeniqua Mountains which bear their name, up until the mouth of the Grootbrak River in the west.[13] The Houtunqua seem to have remained autonomous from the Inqua (Hamcumqua) expansion in the north with smaller Khoekhoe tribes like the Gamtobaqua[14] coming into the fold of the Houtunqua to seek protection from the ever expanding Inqua to the north east. The Houtunqua were connected to trades routes with the Attaqua and Hessequa to the west.[15] Archaeological evidence suggests that the Houtunqua kept livestock and practised Nomadic Pastoralism but made extensive use of the resources in mountain forests. Excavations in the region have unearthed many caves showing signs of pre-colonial occupation.The discovery of shell middens at Knoetzie beach confirms the idea that like other Khoekhoe peoples, the Houtuniqua made use of the ocean for its resources.[16][17] Oral tradition among the Houtunqua tells how the Houtunqua held specific superstitions about Europeans and believed them to be \"baleful spirits\". Thus the Houtunqua went out of their way to avoid contact with Europeans. Where other Khoekhoe tribes established formal relations and trade with Europeans, the Houtunqua receded deeper and deeper into the mountain forests.[18] As a result the Houtunqua disappeared from the historical record for some time with some Houtunqua eventually assimilating into colonial society of the time. Chief Dikkop, who died in 1816, was the last recorded Chief of the Houtunqua.[19][20]"

        "content": "The first Europeans arrived in the area in 1760, and the farm Melkhoutkraal (literally translating from Afrikaans as 'milk wood kraal') was established on the eastern shore of the Knysna Lagoon. Stephanus Terblans, the first European farmer to settle in the area, was given a loan permit to farm here in 1770. Upon moving to Knysna George Rex, a British-born entrepreneur credited as being the founder of Knysna, acquired the loan rights to Melkhoutkraal in 1804 and later, in 1816, to the farm Welbedacht, which he renamed Eastford.[21] He gave 80 acres (32\u00a0ha) of Eastford to the Colonial Government, on which the Royal Navy established the township of Melville. Rex's properties were sold when he died in 1839. In April 1817, the transport brig Emu, belonging to the Cape Town Dockyard, was the first European vessel to enter the Knysna Heads. She struck a rock, now known as Emu Rock, and was holed.[22] Her crew ran Emu ashore to prevent her sinking. In late April HMS\u00a0Podargus arrived to render assistance.[23] After surveying the area, Podargus sailed safely into the Knysna and retrieved Emu's cargo.[22] The next major settler in Knysna was Captain Thomas Henry Duthie, who married Caroline, George Rex's daughter, and bought a portion of the Uitzigt farm from his father-in-law which Rex had named Belvidere.[24] The construction of a small Norman-style church was commissioned by Duthie on his property, and was consecrated in 1855. The settlement's population grew slowly, and Englishmen such as Henry Barrington and Lt. Col. John Sutherland, who established the settlement of Newhaven on a portion of purchased land, settled in the area. At the time, Knysna was a field cornetcy of Plettenberg Bay within the Magisterial Division of George. In 1858, Knysna became a separate Magisterial Division, new stores and accommodation facilities were opened, and Knysna became the new commercial centre of the region. On their way to New Zealand, the Thesen family who were travelling from Norway fancied the little hamlet of Knysna so much that they decided to stay, bringing with them their knowledge of commerce and sailing. Soon, timber was being exported to the Cape from the vast areas of forest surrounding Knysna, and a steam sawmill and small shipyard were established. Later, these were relocated to Paarden Island, later known as Thesen's Island."

Soon fortune hunters from all over the world arrived at the Millwood Forest in search of gold, and Millwood grew into a bustling town. Millwood was declared a gold field, the first in South Africa. However, soon not enough gold was being recovered to sustain a growing town, and the mining industry in the area collapsed. Some miners relocated to Knysna, bringing their little homes with them. One of the houses, known as 'Millwood House', now functions as a museum."

Knysna's timber industry peaked when George Parkes arrived from Britain and saw the opportunity to use the hardwoods of the Knysna Forest for export to elsewhere in the country, and even overseas. He established the Knysna Forest Company, later renamed Geo. Parkes and Sons Ltd., which is still trading to this day."

The estuary opens to the ocean after passing between two large headlands made up of Peninsula Formation quartzites.[30] These are popularly known as \"The Heads\", and have become infamous due to the loss of boats and fishermen passing through their treacherous and unpredictable waters. The Paquita, a German vessel, sank on the eastern side of the Knysna Heads in 1903. Near them are geological formations, known locally as \"The Map Stones.\" To the north of Knysna, Afro-Montane or temperate rainforest covers the hilly terrain for 20\u00a0km until changing to fynbos or macchia high in the Outeniqua Mountains. The eastern head is heavily developed, while the western head is partially protected by a private nature reserve, Featherbed Nature Reserve, developed and formerly owned by teacher and television presenter William Smith on land he inherited from his father, famed ichthyologist J.

        "content": " Hurricane Hanna was the first of a record-tying six Atlantic hurricanes to make landfall in the United States in one year. The eighth named storm and first hurricane of the extremely active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Hanna developed from a tropical wave originating near Hispaniola. This disturbance dropped heavy rain upon parts of Hispaniola, Cuba, and Florida. The wave gradually became more organized and developed into a tropical depression in the central portion of the Gulf of Mexico. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on July\u00a024, setting a new record for the earliest eighth-named storm in the basin, getting its name 10\u00a0calendar days before the previous record holder, Tropical Storm Harvey of 2005. Hanna steadily intensified as it drifted toward Southern Texas, becoming the season's first hurricane early on July\u00a025. It then began to quickly strengthen just before making landfall at 22:00\u00a0UTC later that day as a high-end Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 973\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.73\u00a0inHg). Hanna weakened quickly as it moved inland and turned west-southwest, eventually dissipating over Mexico on July\u00a026. In Florida, the precursor to Hanna killed one person due to rip currents. Hanna's outer bands also caused rounds of thunderstorms across parts of the Northern Gulf Coast. Along the way, it dumped up to 18 inches (460\u00a0mm) of rain in isolated areas in Southern Texas and Mexico. The storm resulted in 50,000+\u00a0people losing power.[citation needed] Hurricane Hanna caused minor damage to well-built structures, serious damage to smaller structures, and downed powerlines. In Texas, where the storm made landfall, extensive property damage was reported in the Rio Grande Valley especially in Port Mansfield. The brunt of the damage was located south of Corpus Christi due to the eye taking a more southward path than originally forecast. Corpus Christi experienced storm surge flooding and tropical storm-force winds, while areas south of the city experienced hurricane-force sustained winds, and in Mexico, severe flooding caused by Hanna killed four people. Overall, Hurricane Hanna was estimated to have caused a total of at least $1.2 billion in damage.[1]"

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa late on July\u00a011. The convection that accompanied the wave was quickly choked off by dry mid-level air. The system continued westward within these same conditions without developing for several days. As it passed north of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on July\u00a018, minimal, but consistent shallow convection began to build on the northern side of the wave and the NHC began to monitor it for possible development early the next morning.[2][3]\nThe wave slowed and deep convection increased across its axis as it moved through Greater Antilles and the Southern Bahamas, although unfavorable upper-level winds kept it from organizing. However, after entering the southeastern Gulf of Mexico during the afternoon of July\u00a021, the upper-level winds relaxed over the wave, which then started to gradually become better organized and more defined, with a broad area of low pressure forming on July\u00a022.[4] During the morning hours of July\u00a023, hurricane reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system, and was able to find that a closed circulation had developed and it was determined had developed into Tropical Depression Eight at 00:00\u00a0UTC that day while located about 210 nmi south-southeast of the Mouth of the Mississippi River.[5][2] Dry air kept the depression from strengthening for 24\u00a0hours, but at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Hanna.[2] This was confirmed by banding features becoming evident within the newly formed system and hurricane reconnaissance aircraft data indicating tropical storm-force winds inside the nascent storm at around 03:00\u00a0UTC that day. Hanna was the earliest eighth-named storm on record, surpassing Tropical Storm Harvey of 2005 by well over a week.[6] Despite being a large and sprawling storm surrounded by dry air, Hanna continued to steadily intensify as it approached Texas, defying forecasts by strengthening faster than anticipated. This also caused Hanna to dive farther to the south than originally predicted. Microwave imagery around 19:44\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024 showed a developing mid-level eye within a significantly improved inner core of convection. These features continue to organize and become better defined as the system moved west-southwestward and at 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a025, Hanna strengthened into hurricane. Hanna strengthened further despite increasing land interaction, developing an eye of 30\u201335\u00a0nmi on radar and satellite imagery. Reaching a peak intensity of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 973 mbar at 18:00\u00a0UTC, the storm made landfall at Padre Island, Texas, at 22:00\u00a0UTC. Hanna then moved over the Laguna Madre and made a second landfall in Kenedy County, Texas, 10\u00a0nmi north of Port Mansfield, Texas, at 23:15\u00a0UTC with the same wind speeds, although its pressure had risen by a millibar. Once inland, Hanna rapidly weakened, becoming a tropical storm by 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a026. Around 12:00\u00a0UTC that same day, the weakening Hanna moved into Northeastern Mexico and dropped to tropical depression status at 18:00\u00a0UTC when it was located near Monterrey, Mexico, at which time the responsibility of advisories was passed to the Weather Prediction Center.[2][7] The last advisory by the WPC was later issued that day and Hanna dissipated over the mountainous terrain by 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a027.[8][2]"

The Department of Public Safety also provided aircraft, mainly helicopters, for similar purposes.[12][13][14] Search and rescue and cleanup crews were also readied for Hanna's aftermath.[15] The United States Coast Guard urged mariners to clear the waters off the Texas coast and bring large vessels to safety at inland marinas.[16] While Hanna was not expected to pose a significant threat to the Houston area, local emergency management placed high-water rescue trucks and crews on standby.[17][18] The active tropical storm watch was superseded by a tropical storm warning between Port Mansfield and San Luis Pass at 21:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a023.[19] The next day, a hurricane warning was issued for the Texas coast between Baffin Bay and Mesquite Bay;[20] the warning was later expanded southward to Port Mansfield.[21] Additionally, a tornado watch was issued for a portion of Southeast Texas.[22] The Padre Island National Seashore and beaches along the Nueces Bay and the Gulf of Mexico around Corpus Christi were closed in anticipation of storm-enhanced tides.[23][24] Both Texas A&M University\u2013Corpus Christi and Del Mar College limited operations amid the storm's passage.[24] Hanna threatened Texas concurrent with an increase in viral cases associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.[25] At least one drive-through testing site for COVID-19 was closed in Corpus Christi in preparation for Hanna while the pandemic limited the number of emergency management personnel in the Rio Grande Valley.[26][27] Both the Corpus Christi Regional Transportation Authority and the Lower Rio Grande Valley Development Council cancelled their bus services for two days.[28][24][29] The Port of Corpus Christi closed to all ship traffic on July\u00a024 and Corpus Christi International Airport cancelled most flights on July\u00a025.[30][29] A local state of disaster lasting seven days was declared by County Judge Richard F. Cortez in Hidalgo County on July\u00a025 due to the threat of \"catastrophic flooding.\" A state of disaster was also declared in Cameron County and San Patricio County.[25][15][31][32][29] Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 32\u00a0counties across South Texas later that day shortly before Hanna struck the state.[26][33][15] Abbott also appealed for a federal disaster declaration and public assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).[15] Several counties and municipalities distributed sandbags ahead of Hanna's arrival.[34][35][36] Willacy County officials recommended the evacuation of people from Port Mansfield.[37][38][39] A voluntary evacuation order for Baffin Bay, Loyola Beach, Ricardo, and Riviera was issued by Kleberg County Judge Rudy Madrid,[40] while a voluntary evacuation was recommended by San Patricio County Judge David R. Krebs for vulnerable areas.[24] Evacuation shelters were opened across the Rio Grande Valley.[41] A FEMA Dome was opened as a shelter in Kingsville at H.M. King High School and the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio was repurposed as a reception center for evacuees with assistance from the American Red Cross.[33][40][30][12][13][14]  The Texas National Guard and state agencies sent 17\u00a0teams to test evacuees for COVID-19.[30] In Guadalupe, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, a Mexican league soccer match was postponed as a precautionary measure.[42]"

Wind gusts reached up to 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) and storm surge reached as high as 6.24\u00a0ft (1.90\u00a0m) at landfall.[45][33][46] The Bob Hall Pier in Corpus Christi was extensively damaged and eventually collapsed partially due to high winds and storm surge.[47] The Art Museum of South Texas\u2019 first floor and outdoor exhibits at the Texas State Aquarium were inundated by storm surge from Corpus Christi Bay.[48] Areas affected by Hanna were already struggling due to a surge of COVID-19 cases in the region.[49] Several marinas and boats on the coastline were severely damaged.[50] Three individuals had to be rescued from a sinking sailboat on a marina off the coast.[51] Many streets and highways later became inaccessible for much of July 25 and 26.[52] Hanna caused significant crop damage, totaling to $176.6 million (2020 USD).[53] In Port Mansfield, 40% of homes received severe structural damage.[54] Near Laguna Madre, a few boat garages were damaged by high winds.[55] The cities of Mission, McAllen, and Weslaco were also placed under flash flood emergencies due to Hanna's rainbands.[52] Roads in Mission became impassible due to flooding.[56] In Roma, a tin roof was blown off a gas station.[57] In McAllen, a fast food restaurant sign was toppled, and a canal overflowed, flooding numerous roads. In Los Barreras, the roof of a carport was blown away.[58] As Hanna moved further inland and weakened on July\u00a026, the storm unleashed copious amounts of rainfall in South Texas, with rainfall totals reaching up to 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm).[25] Additionally, Hanna's outer bands caused widespread tornado warnings across South Texas and five EF0\u00a0tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down.[59][2] One of these tornadoes briefly touched down and damaged two homes and a hangar in Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport, and moved a Boeing 737 aircraft.[60][2] Even a day following landfall much of the areas near the coast in Corpus Christi remained submerged from storm surge and flash flooding.[51] After sheltering for the storm, thousands of American Electric Power crews worked for days to restore power, but were delayed to some areas due to high water, especially in the Rio Grande Valley.[61][62] As of 14\u00a0September\u00a02020[update], economic losses were estimated at or above US$775\u00a0million.[63]"

        "content": "Tropical Cyclone Elita was an unusual tropical cyclone that made landfall on Madagascar three times. The fifth named storm of the 2003\u201304 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Elita developed in the Mozambique Channel on January 24, 2004. It strengthened to tropical cyclone status before striking northwestern Madagascar on January 28; it was the first storm to strike western Madagascar at that intensity since Cyclone Cynthia in 1991. Elita weakened to tropical depression status while crossing the island, and after exiting into the southwest Indian Ocean, it turned to the west and moved ashore in eastern Madagascar on January 31. After once again crossing the island, the cyclone reached the Mozambique Channel and re-intensified. Elita turned to the southeast to make its final landfall on February 3 along southwestern Madagascar. Two days later, it underwent an extratropical transition; subsequently, the remnant system moved erratically before dissipating on February 13. Elita dropped heavy rainfall of more than 200\u00a0mm (8\u00a0inches), which damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Madagascar. Over 50,000\u00a0people were left homeless, primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara provinces. Flooding from the storm ruined more than 450\u00a0km2 (170\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of agricultural land, including important crops for food. Across the island, the cyclone caused 33\u00a0deaths, with its impact further compounded by Cyclone Gafilo about two months later. Elsewhere, Elita brought rainfall and damage to Mozambique and Malawi, and its outer wind circulation produced rough seas and strong gusts in Seychelles, Mauritius, and R\u00e9union."

        "content": "Toward the end of January 2004, an active phase of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation exited the east coast of Africa and fueled convection (thunderstorms) near Madagascar, beginning on January\u00a020. This pulse, the strongest of the season, was also responsible for generating cyclones Frank and Linda. The thunderstorms coalesced in the Mozambique Channel between Madagascar and Mozambique on January\u00a024, fueled by a surge in the monsoon. That day, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France meteorological office in R\u00e9union[nb 1] designated the system as Tropical Disturbance 06. The surge also increased wind shear in the region, which displaced the convection from the circulation. Drifting southwestward at first, the system became more defined, culminating with a marked increase in thunderstorms on January\u00a026. That day, the MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Elita near Juan de Nova Island.[2] On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] initiated advisories on the system, designating it Tropical Cyclone 09S.[3] Steered by a ridge to the west, the nascent Tropical Storm Elita turned northward over its previous path, an unusual trajectory for the Mozambique Channel. The convection fluctuated until January\u00a028, when a curved rainband developed and quickly organized into an eyewall; this followed a decrease in wind shear. Another ridge to the northeast blocked the northward movement, and Elita turned to the east-southeast toward the west coast of Madagascar. Around 15:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a028, the storm made landfall at Bombetoka Bay, or about 30\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) southwest of Mahajanga. The airport there recorded 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph), and on that basis, the MFR upgraded Elita to tropical cyclone status in post-season analysis. This made Elita the first tropical cyclone to strike western Madagascar since Cyclone Cynthia in 1991. While Elita was active, both the JTWC and the MFR estimated an intensity of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) at the first landfall.[4][2][5] Over land, the storm rapidly weakened to a tropical depression, and the JTWC temporarily discontinued issuing advisories. The center of Elita crossed Madagascar, passing near Madagascar's capital Antananarivo, and redeveloped thunderstorms in its eastern periphery. Late on January\u00a029, the circulation emerged into the Indian Ocean near Mahanoro. A ridge to the east turned the system back to the west, allowing the system only about 24\u00a0hours over open waters. During that time, the structure reorganized slightly, and the MFR upgraded Elita to a moderate tropical storm on January\u00a030. The storm made its second landfall near Mananjary, and crossed Madagascar a second time over the course of 24\u00a0hours.[2][5] Early on January\u00a031, Elita emerged again into the Mozambique Channel, and the JTWC began reissuing advisories. With warm waters and low wind shear, Elita re-intensified off the west coast of Madagascar, reaching moderate tropical storm status for a third time on February\u00a01. After moving west-northwestward, the storm stalled on February\u00a02 due to a building ridge to the north. At that time, Elita was about 140\u00a0km (85\u00a0mi) southwest of where it attained tropical storm status for the first time six days prior. The convection reorganized into a central dense overcast, but unlike its first period of intensification, no eye feature developed. Late on February\u00a02, the JTWC assessed peak winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) \u2013 the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. Around that time, Elita moved ashore Madagascar for a third time near Morondava, which reported a minimum barometric pressure of 969.6\u00a0mbar (28.63\u00a0inHg). Due to the lack of wind observations, the MFR estimated a peak landfall intensity of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), although the agency noted that the storm could have attained tropical cyclone intensity again.[2][5] Crossing Madagascar for a third time, Elita closely followed the trajectory of its second passage, emerging into the Indian Ocean near Manakara on February\u00a03. Despite initial forecasts of re-intensification, Elita accelerated southeastward and lost its remaining convection, leaving its center exposed under the influence of a strong upper-level trough. The structure resembled a subtropical cyclone as the surface circulation became broader. Late on February\u00a04, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the MFR classified Elita as an extratropical cyclone on the next day. For the next week, the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar. On February\u00a011, the residual circulation tracked southwestward, only to accelerate southeastward away from the region on February\u00a013, when the MFR ceased monitoring the system.[5][3]"

This produced heavy rainfall of over 150\u00a0mm (6\u00a0in), which destroyed more than 80\u00a0houses and a clinic in Karonga district.[4] The Mozambique National Institute of Meteorology advised people living in Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, and Inhambane Provinces to make preparations for strong winds and rainfall.[6] Elita impacted four provinces of Mozambique. Much of the impact was along the coast from Inhambane to Nampula.[6] In Nampula province, over 2,000\u00a0buildings were destroyed. The most severe damage was to generally poorly built houses. In the city of Nampula, a school was badly damaged, and in Nacala-a-Velha, some residents had to spend the night of January 29 outside.[7] The precursor to Elita dropped heavy rainfall in the Comoros and Mayotte. In the latter island, 100 to 150\u00a0mm (3.9 to 5.9\u00a0in) of rainfall within 24\u00a0hours produced landslides and contributed to three deaths, when the walls of a house collapsed.

        "content": "Typhoon Olga, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Didang, was a strong typhoon that brought widespread damage to the Philippines in May 1976, causing what was called the \"worst flooding in 30 years\". The storm killed over 300 people and displaced over 1.3 million others. The storm originated from an area of several surface circulations on May 4, in which the JTWC first noted its predecessor as a southwestward-moving storm on May 12. However, it was first tracked by the JMA on May 11. Nevertheless, it strengthened to a tropical storm while continuing its motion and track. However, it weakened to a tropical depression as it slowly interacted with another circulation to its east, in which the new system dominated over the existing one. The JMA and JTWC still treated the storm as Olga as it entered the area of responsibility of the Philippines, in which the state weather bureau tracked the system as \"Didang\". Despite the presence of shear around the storm, the system slowly consolidated and grew as it neared the country and few hours prior to landfall, it rapidly intensified to a Category 3 storm before its landfall over Aurora on May 21. Upon inland, Olga subsequently weakened to a tropical storm as it slowed down over Central Luzon before finally exiting through the South China Sea on May 24. There, it slightly strengthened to a tropical storm as it neared land again, this time over Northern Luzon before becoming absorbed by a subtropical disturbance to the south of Okinawa on May 28, in which the JTWC last monitored the system one day prior. However, the JMA continued to track the system along with Olga's remnants until they dropped their advisories while near the International Date Line on May 31. As a slow-moving system, Olga caused copious amounts of rainfall over the Philippines, with one area recording 50 inches of rain (1,300\u00a0mm), becoming one of the wettest tropical cyclones the island nation had ever endured. 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) winds were also recorded at Iba, where sets for the movie Apocalypse Now were destroyed and its staff were forced to shelter in hotels and houses. 374 people were killed and over 1.3 million were left homeless. Many public infrastructures including a dam, dikes and other reservoirs were damaged while agricultural crops were inundated by the storm's rains. Further, floods affected the wide swath of Luzon, with the Central portion of the island being the most affected. Damages from the storm were officially estimated by the President at that time, Ferdinand Marcos to be at $70 million. Meanwhile, its deaths and the resulting destruction resulted in its local name \u201cDidang\u201d being retired."

        "content": "On May 4, the JTWC noted multiple surface circulation zones inside a trough near Micronesia. For some of its early life, this precursor circulation generally moved southwestward, although the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first tracked its predecessor at 18:00 UTC of May 11 as a 1,004 hectopascals (29.6\u00a0inHg) system. On May 12, the JTWC had issued a warning on the system, citing that one circulation had started to overtake the others. Six hours later, the disturbance made a west-northwest movement as being guided by the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge in the Pacific before the agency upgraded the system to a tropical storm on the next day in the afternoon.[1][2] That night, satellite imagery revealed the presence of another circulation, located 120 nautical miles (220\u00a0km; 140\u00a0mi) to the east of Olga. The new circulation interacted with the strengthening system, before the original center dissipated and its remaining convection had been absorbed by the second feature while moving west-northwest. Slowly but modest intensification prevailed over the disturbance, and the new cyclone reintensified to a tropical storm. However, both the JMA and JTWC continued tracking this system as Olga. It then inclined northwards due to a shortwave trough trailing across the westerlies on May 16 before resuming its track to the west-northwest as a result of the trough moving to the east. At this time, Olga was now tracked by the Manila Weather Bureau (now the PAGASA) as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and assigned it the local name \u201cDidang\u201d.[1][2][3] Olga subsequently entered an area of unfavorable wind shear caused by a 200 mb ridge inclined over the Southeast Asia and despite this, it slowly intensified while nearing the mainland Philippines. The cyclone also initiated a counterclockwise loop and slowed down as a result of a long-wave trough moving off the east coast of China. The system completed this loop on October 20 while continuing to slowly strengthen. Reconnaissance aircraft reports from 03:30 UTC and 19:47 UTC indicated that Olga started to underwent rapid intensification as a pressure drop of 44 mb (from 978 mb to 934 mb) were recorded. At approximately 00:00 UTC of the next day, Olga made landfall on the province of Aurora with an estimated maximum sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 940 hectopascals (28\u00a0inHg), making at a Category 3 typhoon.[1][2] Upon moving inland, Olga's winds rapidly degraded to tropical storm-force winds as it passed over Baler Bay before crossing through Central Luzon. Moving with a forward speed from 2 to 4 knots, it moved to the west-southwest, before taking a westward path. Still as a gale-force system, the cyclone turned northwest before exiting through Lingayen Gulf on May 24. It subsequently reintensified slightly before turning to the northeast, this time sparing Northern Luzon a direct hit again from the system as it passed through Batanes as it inclined north-northeast. By the next day, what was Olga is now just a low-level circulation separated through its convection while accelerating away from the typhoon-stricken Philippines. The system was last tracked by the weather bureau of the Philippines on May 26 before the final advisory was issued by the JTWC at 06:00 UTC of that day while located to the east of Hengchun in Formosa (now Taiwan). The agency also noted that the remnants of Olga were absorbed into a subtropical disturbance on May 27 to the south of Okinawa, although the JMA continued to track the system until they dropped monitoring it on 12:00 UTC of May 31 near the International Date Line.[1][2][3][4]"

Along with the prevailing southwest monsoon over the country, the cyclone caused heavy rainfall along the Southern, Central and Northern portions of Luzon, causing catastrophic floods. Millions lost their homes due to the inundation and many reservoirs overflowed and burst due to continuous downpour, again affecting many individuals. The final death toll for the storm were at 374 while damages reached in millions of dollars. At Cubi Point, the rainfall exceeded over 50 inches (1,300\u00a0mm), which would place the system as one of the wettest tropical cyclones in the Philippines.[1] The summary of the events after the storm wrecked through the country are summarized by date[nb 1] as follows:"

Many of these storms affected the Philippines, China, and Japan, collectively leaving 15,952\u00a0fatalities. The strongest storm of the year also had the lowest barometric pressure recorded in a tropical cyclone worldwide at the time. On August\u00a018, the Dutch steamship Sapoeroea recorded a barometric pressure of 886.7\u00a0millibar (26.185\u00a0inches of mercury) about 740\u00a0kilometres (460\u00a0miles) east of Luzon. This typhoon later struck near Hong Kong, where it halted transportation, wrecked buildings, and killed 15\u00a0people. The first storm of the year originated near the Caroline Islands on February\u00a012, which capsized the freighter Elkton and caused the loss of its crew of 36\u00a0people. Storms were observed in each subsequent month of the year. In May, a typhoon wrecked the passenger ferry SS Negros near the Philippine province of Romblon, killing 108\u00a0people. A typhoon in July killed around 10,000\u00a0people in China, mostly related to mountain flooding near Zhangzhou, leaving around 100,000\u00a0people homeless. A month later, another landfalling typhoon in China killed about 5,000\u00a0people and damaged nearly 20,000\u00a0houses. In September, an intense typhoon moved through Japan around the same time that an undersea earthquake affected the region; the concurrent disasters killed about 600\u00a0people, after a 3\u00a0metre (10\u00a0foot) tsunami washed away boats and houses along the coast. Another Chinese typhoon in September killed 5,000\u00a0people. The final storm of the year dissipated on December\u00a019 to the west of the Philippines."

The thirty-eighth depression, nineteenth tropical storm, ninth typhoon, and third super typhoon of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, it was the strongest typhoon to strike mainland Japan in decades, and one of the largest typhoons ever recorded, with a peak gale-force diameter of 825 nautical miles (949\u00a0mi; 1,528\u00a0km). The typhoon raised global media attention, as it greatly affected the 2019 Rugby World Cup being hosted by Japan.[2] Hagibis was also the deadliest typhoon to strike Japan since Typhoon Fran in 1976.[3] Hagibis developed from a tropical disturbance located a couple hundred miles north of the Marshall Islands on October 2, 2019. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a red tropical cyclone formation alert\u2014noting that the disturbance could undergo rapid intensification upon being identified as a tropical depression. On the next day, October 3, both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 20W. The depression stayed at the same intensity as it travelled west toward the Mariana Islands on October 4, but on October 5, 20W began undergoing rapid intensification and early that day, the system was issued with the name Hagibis by the JMA, which means \"speed\" in Filipino. Sea surface temperatures and wind shear became extremely favourable for tropical cyclogenesis and Hagibis started extremely rapid intensification on October 6, and became a Category 5 super typhoon in under 12 hours\u2014the second of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season. Edging closer to the uninhabited areas of the Mariana Islands, Hagibis displayed excellent convection as well as a well-defined circulation. The system developed a pinhole eye and made landfall on the Northern Mariana Islands at peak intensity, with 10-minute sustained winds of 105\u00a0kn (195\u00a0km/h; 120\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (27.02\u00a0inHg).[4] Land interaction did not affect Hagibis much, but as the system continued to move westward, it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, which is usual for all tropical cyclones of a similar intensity. The inner eyewall was robbed of its needed moisture and Hagibis began to weaken, but the storm developed a large, cloud-filled eye, which then became clear, and Hagibis restrengthened to reach its second peak. Travelling toward Japan, Hagibis encountered high vertical wind shear and its inner eyewall began to degrade, and the outer eyewalls rapidly eroded as its center began to be exposed. On October 12, Hagibis made landfall on Japan at 19:00 JST (10:00 UTC) on the Izu Peninsula near Shizuoka. Then, an hour later at 20:00 JST (11:00 UTC), Hagibis made its second landfall on Japan in the Greater Tokyo Area. Due to increasing wind shear at 60 knots (69\u00a0mph; 110\u00a0km/h), its structure became torn apart as it sped at 34 knots (39\u00a0mph; 63\u00a0km/h) north-northeast toward more hostile conditions. On October 13, Hagibis became an extratropical low and the JMA and JTWC issued their final advisories on the system. However, the extratropical remnant of Hagibis persisted for more than a week, before dissipating on October 22. Hagibis caused catastrophic destruction across much of eastern Japan. Hagibis spawned a large tornado on October 12, which struck the Ichihara area of Chiba Prefecture during the onset of Hagibis; the tornado, along with a 5.7 magnitude earthquake off the coast, caused additional damage to those areas that were damaged by Hagibis.[5][6] Hagibis caused more than $17 billion (2019 USD) in damages, making it, at the time, the costliest typhoon on record until it was beaten by Typhoon Doksuri of 2023 (when not adjusted for inflation).[7]"

        "content": "In early October, a poorly-organized and broad area of storms persisted over 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi) east of Guam. With favorable atmospheric conditions and warm sea surface temperatures prevailing, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began noting the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis on October\u00a04,[8] eventually issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the next day.[9] The system initially remained stationary,[10] consolidating a center of circulation in the lower levels of the atmosphere.[9] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the disturbance a tropical depression at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05.[4] At the time, the system was 1,030\u00a0km (640\u00a0mi) northeast of Pohnpei, quickly developing cumulonimbus clouds around its center and establishing conducive outflow as it tracked west around the periphery of an area of high pressure.[11][12] The tropical depression strengthened into a tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05 while 1,560\u00a0km (970\u00a0mi) east of Guam,[4] gaining the name Hagibis.[13] A dominant curved rainband had begun to wrap around the center of Hagibis, signifying further organization.[14] On October\u00a06, the storm made a slight turn towards the west-southwest and began an accelerated period of intensification within an environment with low wind shear and atop warm waters,[15][4] reaching severe tropical storm intensity at 12:00\u00a0UTC and typhoon strength six hours later as it developed a small eye.[4][16] Typhoon Hagibis entered a period of explosive intensification on October\u00a07,[17] with its central pressure falling 55\u00a0hPa (mbar; 1.62\u00a0inHg) in 12\u00a0hours according to the JMA.[4] Estimates from the JTWC suggested a 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) increase in the storm's maximum winds in 22\u00a0hours. During this phase, Hagibis maintained a pinhole eye 9\u00a0km (5.6\u00a0mi) across, encircled by a highly compact and sharply-defined eyewall.[17] The rate of intensification was among the fastest observed in the Western Pacific.[18] According to the JMA, Hagibis reached its peak intensity at 09:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a07 with a minimum pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (mbar; 27.02\u00a0inHg) and 10-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph); Hagibis would maintain this intensity for 72\u00a0hours.[4] The JTWC classified Hagibis as a super typhoon early on October\u00a07,[19] and later assessed peak 1-minute sustained winds of 295\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph), while also estimating a pressure of 890\u00a0hPa (mbar; 26.28\u00a0inHg), as Hagibis passed just south of Anatahan in the Northern Mariana Islands.[20] Hagibis was unusually rapid in its trek through the Mariana Islands, traveling with a forward motion of 27\u201334\u00a0km/h (17\u201321\u00a0mph).[21] After passing the Mariana Islands, Hagibis began an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused the rapid intensification phase to end. As the primary eyewall began to erode,[22] the JTWC downgraded the typhoon to a Category\u00a04-equivalent super typhoon at 00:00 UTC on October\u00a08. Several hours later, Hagibis completed the eyewall replacement cycle and reintensified to Category\u00a05-equivalent intensity, attaining a secondary peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph). Hagibis began to weaken on October\u00a010, as sea surface temperatures decreased and wind shear increased. Mild strengthening was forecast shortly after Hagibis downgraded to a Category 3 typhoon, but this prediction failed to materialize, as the storm neared land and its outer rainbands began to erode. After gradual weakening, Hagibis made landfall on Shizuoka as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, with 1-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), at around 08:30\u00a0UTC on October\u00a012. While over Japan, Hagibis became disorganized from high wind shear and eventually became extratropical on October\u00a013.[23] Afterward, the extratropical remnant of Hagibis accelerating northeastward, for the next few days. From October 16 to 20, Hagibis made a counter-clockwise loop over the western Bering Sea, while gradually weakening. Afterward, the remnant of Hagibis drifted southwestward and then eastward, before dissipating on October\u00a022."

Three matches of the 2019 Rugby World Cup were cancelled due to Hagibis, including the Pool B matches between New Zealand and Italy, and Canada and Namibia, and the Pool C match between England and France. This marked the first time that matches have been cancelled in the history of the Rugby World Cup.[30][31] All cancelled matches were counted as draws: the cancelled fixture effectively eliminated Italy from the tournament, as they had a chance to potentially qualify for the knockout stage with a sufficient margin of victory against New Zealand.[32] On October\u00a011, it was announced that the Saturday practice session for the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka Circuit would be cancelled, and the Saturday qualifying session was postponed to Sunday morning prior to the race.[33] The F4 Japanese Championship cancelled its round at the circuit as well.[34] Nippon Professional Baseball postponed both Game 4 Climax Series games in the 2019 Pacific League Climax Series and the 2019 Central League Climax Series, despite the games being played indoors in domed stadiums[a].

From November 29 to December 1, Kammuri was unable to strengthen to previous estimates due to its near stationary movement as a result of weak steering currents, upwelling itself consequently. On December 2, the system tracked westward at a much faster speed of 19\u00a0km/h (12\u00a0mph) and rapidly intensified over warm Philippine Sea waters, before making landfall in the Bicol Region of the Philippines at peak intensity as a category 4-equivalent typhoon. Upon leaving the Philippines, Kammuri significantly weakened as wind shear increased and interaction with the Philippine islands caused the structure of the system to degrade rapidly, and throughout December 3, it stayed as a category 1-equivalent typhoon, with its outer rainbands barely on land. By December 4, Kammuri drifted over the South China Sea as a weakening tropical storm. Through December 5 and 6, Kammuri weakened significantly and its low-level circulation center became exposed; as a result, it dissipated on December 6."

        "content": "On November 23, 2019, a low pressure system developed to the southeast of Guam. It then began to show signs of development and earned a defined circulation, developing into a tropical depression on November 25, with the JTWC assigning it as 29W. The depression then began to develop banding features to the northeast of its center, confirming intensification and allowing it to earn the name Kammuri (which is a Japanese name for Corona Borealis). Kammuri then passed south of Guam, and further intensified into a severe tropical storm on November 27, and then into a typhoon the next day. As the weak typhoon continued west, upwelling of itself due to its quasi-stationary movement combined with moderate wind shear hindered significant intensification of Kammuri over the next three days. It eventually entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) with PAGASA assigning the name Tisoy on November 30. After entering the PAGASA's area of responsibility, Kammuri began to show signs of intensification again, and PAGASA noted the possibility of Kammuri making landfall in the Philippines as a somewhat powerful typhoon.[1] After very slowly moving west and on approach to the Philippines, the system began to accelerate towards the Philippines and then began to rapidly intensify by the time it came within 321 kilometers of the coast of Catanduanes, due to the lowering of wind shear and increasing ocean heat content; all of which combined to counteract the upwelling. It became a category 2 typhoon and soon after, a category 3 typhoon. Kammuri reached its peak intensity as a 220\u00a0km/h category 4-equivalent typhoon on 07:00 UTC on December 2, and PAGASA reported that Kammuri had made its first landfall over Gubat, Sorsogon at 11:00 pm, December 2, very shortly after reaching its peak intensity.[2][3] Through midnight and early morning of December 3, Kammuri crossed the Bicol Region and weakened due to land interaction.[4] It made another landfall at 4:00 am PST over San Pascual town on Burias Island.[5][6][3] Moving in a generally westward direction, Kammuri weakened into a Category 3 after land interaction and developed a new eye, moving very close to the Bondoc Peninsula[7] before making its third and fourth landfalls at 8:30 am PST over Torrijos, Marinduque[8][3][9] and at 12:30 pm PST over Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, respectively.[10] Continued land interaction weakened Kammuri to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon before it exited the Philippine landmass. The center of the typhoon was reported to be over the Mindoro Strait by late afternoon.[11][12] Soon after, the system continued to weaken and became a Category 1-equivalent typhoon as it entered the South China Sea. Kammuri's structure then began to suffer, with wind shear tearing apart convection on the western portion of the storm as it weakened back into a tropical storm while drifting over the South China Sea. By 11:00 am PST, December 5, PAGASA issued its last bulletin on Kammuri as it exited the PAR.[13] Kammuri lost its inner rainbands and its low-level circulation center became exposed to high wind shear, causing the system to dissipate on December 6 with the JMA issuing its final advisory on the system."

TCWS #1 was raised in the province of Antique and therefore, suspended classes in a total of 14 towns. Some of the suspensions were issued for all levels while others were only from pre-school to senior high.[22] Local governments throughout Eastern Visayas declared suspension of classes in all levels along with work. Provinces such as Northern Samar, Samar, Eastern Samar and Biliran were raised to a TCWS #2 while Leyte and Southern Leyte only had a TCWS #2.[23] In Cebu, TCWS #2 was also alerted which prompted 7,376 people to evacuate.[24] Over 200,000 people were evacuated ahead of Kammuri due to fears of flooding and landslides.[25] Flights and operations at Ninoy Aquino International Airport were suspended for twelve hours starting at 11:00\u00a0p.m. PST on December 3, 2019, and ending at 11:00\u00a0a.m. on December 4.[26][27] 16 flights were canceled at Mactan\u2013Cebu International Airport on December 2.[28] A total of 358 domestic flights and 203 international flights were cancelled due to Kammuri.[27]"

After the passage of the storm, roads between regions, especially routes from the Bicol Region towards Manila were not passable due to fallen branches and uproot trees. Several vehicles and passengers were stranded along highways due to this.[34] On December 4, the provinces of Albay and Sorsogon, and the city of Naga were issued a state of calamity after widespread damages were seen.[35] The region's Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) estimated that an estimated 130,000 children were affected by the storm.[36] In Camarines Sur, about 293 classrooms suffered from major damages while the province of Albay had a total of 883 classrooms damaged as of December 5.[36] By December 6, Catanduanes experienced heavy damages and therefore, a state of calamity was issued.[37] On December 4, Northern Samar's Province Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) recommended a state of calamity, and shortly after, it was raised in two towns: Catarman and Gamay.[33][38] Massive destruction along with widespread flooding, damaged houses, landslides and even weak communication signal prompted their local government to issue the state of calamity in the two towns.[38] 224,171 individuals were affected by Kammuri (Tisoy) in Northern Samar, and based on post-disaster assessment, about 28,577 houses were damages while an additional 3,774 were washed out by extreme flooding.[33] Power outages were seen in many villages, and the Northern Samar Electric Cooperative stated that power supply would be restored in Catarman and nearby towns by Christmas Day, but other towns could still suffer from no power until after Christmas.[33] Moreover, Kammuri's rain bands extended to as far north as Cagayan Valley, where, with the inclusion of the northeastern monsoon, saw one of the worst flooding in decades for the northern region. Roughly 66,000 people have evacuated their homes due to extreme flooding and torrential flooding.[39] On December 6, state of calamity was raised. Severe flooding in 18 areas in the province damaged agriculture and paralyzed transportation.[37] As of January 22, 2020, the NDRRMC stated that at least 17 people were dead and at least 318 were injured.[40] There has been an estimated damages of \u20b16.65\u00a0billion (US$130\u00a0million) across the nation and about \u20b195.7\u00a0million (US$1.87\u00a0million) to relief efforts and assistance.[41] Totals of 2,249 damaged schools and 558,844 damaged houses, of which 63,466 were \"totally\" damaged, were reported.[41] 121 road sections and 5 bridges were damaged due to Kammuri, of which six road sections and one bridge were still considered impassable a week after landfall.[41]"

It was also the worst to hit the region since Talas in 2011, until the region was hit by the more destructive Typhoon Hagibis less than a month later.[2] Forming as the fifteenth named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, the precursor to Faxai was first noted as a weak tropical depression to the east of the International Dateline on August 29. The depression then entered the West Pacific basin on August 30. After moving in a general westward direction, the system strengthened into a named tropical storm by September 5. Faxai then strengthened into the sixth typhoon of the season the next day. Two days later, Faxai reached its peak strength as a Category 4 typhoon just before making landfall in mainland Japan. Turning northeastward, Faxai rapidly weakened and became extratropical on September 10. Three people were killed and 147 others were injured. More than 390,000 people were urged to be evacuated. Faxai left 934,000 households without power.

        "content": "On August 30, 2019, a tropical disturbance formed approximately 1,402\u00a0km (871\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands, and was marked as Invest 90W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).[6] A broad overcast obscured the system's circulation whilst thunderstorms or convection developed to the northwest of the system.[7] The disturbance continued to stockpile deep convection over very warm sea surface temperatures of 31 to 32\u00a0\u00b0C (88 to 90\u00a0\u00b0F) and low vertical wind shear, conditions which are conducive for further tropical cyclogenesis.[8] By September 1, the JTWC announced a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the system began to develop rainbands extending to the north.[9] The system was designated Tropical Depression 14W by the JTWC at 18:00 UTC on that same day.[10] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) later recognize the system as a tropical depression early on September 2.[11] As the depression passed just southwest of Wake Island, the JTWC estimated that the system had intensified into a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC,[10] though the JMA still kept the classification as a tropical depression by that time.[11] While maintaining the tropical storm strength according to the JTWC, the system strolled westward then west-northwestward alongside a subtropical ridge for the course of two days.[10] During September 4, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning the name Faxai.[11] On the following day, deep convection was displaced to the east of the partially-exposed circulation. A tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell to the northwest with troughing to the south of it induced strong subsidence to the west of the system. It weakened westward outflow, hindering development from atop, though another TUTT cell to the east provided ventilation for the shifted convection.[12] Later on September 5, the circulation moved underneath the convection.[13] The TUTT cell to the northwest weakened on September 6, allowing poleward outflow to develop.[14] At 06:00 UTC, Faxai attained severe tropical storm status from the JMA.[11] As Faxai organized its convection, it began to develop an eye feature.[15] Faxai later intensified into a typhoon as according to Dvorak estimates by the JTWC;[16] the JMA did not upgrade the storm's status until 00:00 UTC of September 7.[11] Owing to the favorable conditions, Faxai underwent rapid intensification, attaining 1-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph). The eye had expanded to 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi), surrounded by 170\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) of compact convection in the center.[17] By 18:00 UTC, Faxai had attained its peak intensity; the JMA assessed 10-minute sustained winds at 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and the lowest barometric pressure at 955\u00a0hPa (28.20\u00a0inHg),[11] and the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. Sustained by low vertical wind shear and radial outflow, the storm maintained its intensity for 12 hours.[10] On September 8, Faxai weakened for the onset of an eyewall replacement cycle.[18] The subtropical ridge steered Faxai east-northeastward after having its northwestern periphery eroded by the westerlies. In 18:00 UTC, Faxai made landfall above the Kant\u014d Plain with 1-minute winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[10] Entering a region of cooler waters, Faxai began to weaken significantly.[19] It fell below typhoon strength at 12:00 UTC. As the storm accelerated at 31\u00a0km/h (20\u00a0mph) by September 10, it embedded with the baroclinic zone, commencing the transition into an extratropical cyclone. In 18:00 UTC, the storm had transformed into a cold-core low of gale-force, with wind force that extended 1,500\u00a0km (920\u00a0mi) east of Misawa Air Base.[10] It continued to shift east-northeastward, crossing the International Date Line on September 11, before dissipating by 18:00 UTC of that day.[11]"

Throughout Barbour County, Alabama, the tornado injured three and caused $2,500 in damage, although what was damaged in the county is unknown.[2][5][6][10] The tornado then entered Quitman County, Georgia well to the north of Georgetown and began to curve northeastward. Damage here was mainly limited to trees before the tornado moved into Stewart County, where the worst effects from the tornado were felt. There were no casualties in Quitman County, but there was $250,000 in damage.[2][6][10] Upon entering Stewart County, the tornado hit town of Sanford, where some damage occurred. It then continued northeastward through rural areas before causing some of its worst damage as it tore through the northwest side of Lumpkin in Shady Grove. Several homes and smaller buildings were damaged and a fire lookout tower was toppled. The tornado then moved back into rural areas, continuing to damage or down hundreds of trees before striking Pleasant Valley. A home, church, and several smaller buildings were destroyed while other buildings along trees were damaged. Utility lines were blown down and some crops in storage lost. Throughout the town, one person was killed, three others were injured, losses totaled $15,000. The tornado then struck the town of Red Hill as it passed to the north of Richland with the funnel cloud being observed and a roaring sound like several jet planes in motion were heard. Two homes and a few smaller buildings were demolished, several others were severely damaged, including four automobiles, a tractor, and a trailer, and a large amounts of crops in storage were blown away. There were 16\u00a0injures and $35,000 in losses in town. Throughout Stewart County, the tornado killed one, injured\u00a020, and caused $250,000 in damage.[2][6][10] The tornado then entered Webster County, where it turned more to the east and moved through rural areas as it approached the town of Church Hill. It then struck the town as it was moving into Marion County, demolishing one home and heavily damaging several other buildings, including a church. Throughout the town, there were $10,000 in losses and eight people were injured. Hundreds of trees continued to be damage as the tornado continued on its path. Throughout, Webster County, the tornado injured eight and caused $250,000 in damage. An additional $250,000 in damage also occurred in Marion County.[6][10] The tornado then moved into Schley County. After moving due east, it abruptly made a left turn northwest of Shiloh and traveled north-northeast, taking it directly into Ellaville. Just outside the latter place, the tornado wrecked five homes. Damage was inflicted throughout the town and dozen of trees were downed before the tornado finally dissipated as it was exiting town. Throughout Schley County, the tornado injured four and caused $500,000 in damage.[6][10] The tornado (or tornado family) was on the ground for at least 2\u00a0hours and 15\u00a0minutes, traveled 71.5 miles (115.1\u00a0km), had a maximum width of 250 yards (230\u00a0m), and caused $1.5025\u00a0million (1954\u00a0USD) in damage.

The 23rd depression and the 8th typhoon of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, Mitag developed from a low pressure system near the Micronesia Islands on September 24. Tracking generally northwestward, the system gradually organised and the Japanese Meteorological Agency issued its first advisory on Tropical Depression 19W on September 27. It continued northeastward, gradually organizing and becoming less broad. It was then upgraded to Tropical Storm Mitag on September 28. The storm quickly intensified, becoming a Category 1 typhoon just a day later. It further intensified into a Category 2 typhoon, passing very close to Taiwan. It weakened thereafter, making landfall near Zhoushan in East China on October 1 before weakening back to a poorly organized tropical storm. It later made landfall in South Korea on October 2 before becoming extratropical in the Japan Sea on October 3."

Traipsing toward the Philippines and eventually entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility the next day[1] with the Philippine Atmospherical, Geological and Astronomical Services Administration routinely named it Onyok. The JMA followed suit after the system intensified to become a tropical storm, naming it Mitag on September 28.[2] The JTWC's projected track path lead Mitag toward the Ryukyu Islands, all while strengthening. Mitag, while gaining latitude, strengthened quickly on September 29 and within just hours became a severe tropical storm,[3] and shortly after, a category 1 typhoon later on that same day.[4] Developing a visible circulation and with thick bands of strong convection, it swiftly became a category 2 typhoon on the evening of September 30, with a small, clouded eye developing as it passed just east of Taiwan.[5][6] Due to a sudden increase in wind shear and decrease in sea surface temperatures, Mitag began to quickly degrade after becoming a category 2 typhoon, and weakened to a category 1 typhoon before making its first mainland landfall on Zhoushan, exiting the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[7][8] The land interaction disrupted Mitag by quite some margin, and it weakened to a tropical storm relatively quickly during landfall. It quickly moved northeast towards South Korea as it began to enter its extratropical transition on the evening of October 1.[9] Mitag made its second landfall on South Korea on October 2 whilst surprisingly holding onto tropical storm strength and remaining a poorly organized tropical cyclone.[10] Shortly after land interaction with South Korea, its low-level circulation center was continually exposed by westerly wind shear and its cloud tops became displaced, leading to it weakening below tropical depression status on October 3 and becoming extratropical the next day.[11]"

        "content": " Typhoon Bualoi was a tropical cyclone that formed during October 2019. The fortieth tropical depression, and the eleventh typhoon of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, Bualoi originated from a disturbance east of the Marshall Islands on October 17, 2019, that quickly organized to a tropical depression on October 19, earning the designated name 22W. Favorable conditions strengthened the depression into a tropical storm. The Japan Meteorological Agency gave it the name Bualoi in response. Bualoi rapidly intensified and became a typhoon on October 20, before its rate of strengthening was stopped by a tropical upper tropospheric trough the following day. The rate was later recommenced through rapid intensification, making Bualoi reach its peak on October 22 as a Category 5-equivalent typhoon, with 10-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and one-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). Bualoi rapidly weakened on October 23 due to wind shear and continued before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone and dissipating on October 25. After affecting the Mariana Islands, where an emergency declaration was issued, warm moist air flowed into Bualoi, causing the atmosphere to become unstable and produce torrential rains over Japan on October 25. Around that time, the country was still in the recovery process after Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis had devastated the archipelago. Most of the damage occurred in Chiba Prefecture, though other prefectures such as Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures, were also affected. Across the prefectures, about half of the 13 fatalities took place in a car as the automobiles were swept or submerged in rivers flooded by the rain, and happened during evacuation. Transportation services were also stopped in the affected areas. About 4,998 houses were destroyed, contributing to the total of over US$200 million in damages."

Warm, moist air flowed into the typhoon and caused Bualoi to flow excessive rain upon the prefecture on October 25, despite not reaching land.[28] Advisories were issued across the country and evacuations took place.[29] According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, 26 casualties were reported; 13 people were killed and 13 were injured, with 5 of the injuries being serious. 4,998 houses were damaged across the country, according to the agency.[30] Total loss were finalized at over US$200\u00a0million.[31] Damages such as floods and the flooding of rivers and landslides mainly occurred in the Chiba Prefecture. About half of the fatalities occurred in a car, such as when the car was submerged or washed away by the river while evacuating by car.[28] In Chiba Prefecture, two landslides occurred in Midori-ku, Yokohama, killing two men and women in their 60s and a woman in her 40s. A landslide also occurred in Ichihara, killing a woman in her 50s. In Mobara, a man died after being swept away by a river. Another report claimed that a woman was seen being swept into the river, after which she was found dead. In Nagara, one man was found in each of the two cars, but both died. In Ch\u014dnan, two men died from similar damage. A man in his 80s was also found dead in Sakura.[32] In S\u014dma, Fukushima, a woman in her 60s was found dead after a river that flowed through the city overflowed. Her son was reported missing before being found dead at Matsukawa-ura Bay.[33] The town of Marumori in Miyagi Prefecture, which was severely damaged by Typhoon Hagibis two weeks ago, including the disruption of railroads, suffered further damage, with more than 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) of rain falling on the 25th.[28] 27 rivers were flooded.[34] Damage also occurred outside the expected inundation areas on the hazard maps created by local governments. Not only the public hall and city hall, which had been used as evacuation centers, were flooded, but deaths also occurred in the roads. In Mobara, Chiba Prefecture, which was flooded in the Ichinomiya River basin, the city hall and the central public hall, which are both outside the expected flooding area, were flooded.[35] About 23,400 households in Chiba had lost power,[36] and up to 4,700 households had lost water.[37][38] Due to the torrential rain, all public transportation systems stopped working, and roads were flooded one after another.[39] The up and down lines between the Ibaraki Airport Kita and Hokota junctions on the Higashi-Kant\u014d Expressway, and the inner and outer loops of the Mobara-Kita and Ichihara-Tsurumai junctions on the Ken-\u014c Expressway were closed.[40] On the following day, the 26th, most of the railway lines resumed operation, but on the East Japan Railway Company between Enokido Station and Naruto Station on the Sobu Main Line, the soil under the tracks was washed away, so operations resumed on October 28.[41] However, due to fallen trees and landslides between Kururi Station and Kazusa-Kameyama Station on the Kururi Line, operation resumed on November 1.[42] The Chiba Green Bus, which has its head office and sales office in Sakura, which was heavily damaged, flooded the nearby Kashima River in the early morning of the 26th, submerging the bus garage. It was damaged to be scrapped.[43] The Cabinet Office Emergency Disaster Response Headquarters responded to the disaster in parallel with the response to Typhoon Hagibis. In addition, two disaster dispatches were carried out by the Self-Defense Forces.[44]"

Early on September 2, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported that Liwayway intensified into a tropical storm, and named the system Lingling. Lingling then continued to organize itself, and soon later, the JTWC upgraded Lingling to a tropical storm. Lingling steadily strengthened, with convection consolidating around the center. Early in the morning of September 3, Lingling further intensified into a severe tropical storm.[4] Late on September 3 UTC (early on September 4 local time), Lingling developed an eye.[5] Subsequently, the JTWC upgraded Lingling into a Category 1 typhoon.

The eye became clear and wide as Lingling intensified even further. Lingling then moved out of the Philippine Area of Responsibility after making landfall in Miyako Island, and PAGASA issued its final advisory on Lingling.[7] Lingling then made landfall as a Category 4 on Miyako-jima, then continued to intensify, and reaching its peak intensity as a violent typhoon, the first since Lekima a month earlier. It gradually weakened as it was east of China. At 2:30\u00a0p.m. KST (05:30 UTC), Lingling made landfall in South Hwanghae Province, North Korea with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph),[8] becoming the first typhoon and the strongest storm to strike the country.[9] On September 8, Lingling weakened to a minimal tropical storm. It moved away from North Korea and the center moved to Russia, weakening even further. Inside Russia, Lingling transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.

In the succeeding days, Haikui reached severe tropical storm strength and eventually became a typhoon, before making landfall near Taitung City, Taiwan on September 3. The remnants of Haikui caused torrential rain in Hong Kong as it stalled over Pearl River Delta, resulting in issuing a Black rainstorm signal for 16 hours, the longest duration ever since the rainstorm warning system was implemented in 1992.

Haikui then moved west-northwest and eventually entered the Philippine area of responsibility at around 21:00 PHT (13:00 UTC) and was promptly assigned the domestic name Hanna. Haikui then maintained its severe tropical storm status for about a day while moving generally westwards across the Philippine Sea, before finally reaching typhoon status on September 1. Haikui then continued westwards over the Philippine Sea with little change in intensity, but later intensified into a Category 2-equivalent typhoon a day later. Haikui later rapidly strengthened into a strong Category 3 typhoon before making landfall over Taitung County, Taiwan, becoming the first storm to hit mainland Taiwan for the first time in 4 years after Severe Tropical Storm Bailu (Ineng), and the first Category 3+ typhoon to hit the island since Typhoon Megi (Helen) in 2016.[1] The collision between Typhoon Haikui & the mountain ranges of Taiwan considerably wrecked the structure of the storm and made it weaken back into a minimal Category 1 typhoon by the time it exited the landmass of the island in the evening. Haikui then moved erratically over the next few hours, heading eastwards and making a second landfall in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.[2] On September 5, Typhoon Haikui made its third and final landfall along the coast of Dongshan County, Fujian as a weakening tropical storm.[3]"

The PAGASA marked the system as a low-pressure area on August\u00a022, and the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression. The PAGASA initially expected the system to not develop into a tropical cyclone,[2] but later upgraded it into a tropical depression the next day, and was given the local name of Goring,[3] it was also given a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert by the JTWC, designated as Tropical Depression 09W. Goring then moved generally north-northwestwards across the Philippine Sea. On August\u00a024, Goring was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC, with the JMA following suit a few hours later at 06:00\u00a0UTC, receiving the name Saola. PAGASA also followed suit in upgrading the system into a tropical storm in their 17:00\u00a0PHT (09:00\u00a0UTC) update. Saola continued to intensify and began to move southwestwards over the Philippine Sea east of the Batanes Islands. PAGASA then started to issue Tropical Cyclone Wind Signals across the eastern parts of Northern Luzon on Friday morning.[4] A few hours later, the JTWC upgraded Saola into a typhoon, with the JMA upgrading the system to a severe tropical storm shortly thereafter. Saola was then later upgraded into a typhoon moments later by the JMA, with JTWC upgrading it to a Category 2, beginning a process of rapid intensification. PAGASA followed suit by the evening and upgraded Saola into a typhoon as well.[5] Saola was then upgraded to a Category 4 typhoon by the morning of August 27 with an initial peak intensities of 120 kts by the JTWC, 95 kts and minimum pressure was 940 mbar by JMA. In the early morning hours of Sunday, PAGASA then upgraded Goring (Saola) into a super typhoon after its winds passed 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), becoming the third storm to enter in their 'super typhoon' category this year.[6] Saola then had some fluctuations in intensity between category 3 and category 4 due to interactions with mountainous terrain and upwelling cold water due to slow movement despite highly favorable environmental conditions. Saola then executed a south-southeastward turn over the Philippine Sea, begin the eyewall replacement cycle and then weakened back into a typhoon per PAGASA, with Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal #2 and #3 being lifted as it moved away from Central Luzon.[7] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also downgraded Saola into Category 2 typhoon, and PAGASA dropped some tropical cyclone wind signals in Eastern Luzon. It then turned northwest, and PAGASA reissued Signal 4 for parts of the Babuyan Islands and then explosively intensified into a Category 5 super typhoon, per the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. PAGASA then followed suit and upgraded Saola (Goring) into a super typhoon once more as it was passing between the Bashi Channel, and issued Signal #5 in the northeastern portion of the Babuyan Islands, the second time this year since Typhoon Doksuri a month earlier. Later that day, Saola crossed the northwestern boundaries of the Philippine Area of Responsibility, and PAGASA issued their final tropical cyclone advisories on it, with storm signals being dropped moments later. Saola remained a powerful super typhoon as it crossed into the South China Sea southwest of Taiwan, featuring a clear and warm eye as it did so.[8] On the afternoon of August 31 (UTC), the JTWC noted that Saola was struggling to complete an eyewall replacement cycle, resulting in some slight weakening. However, Saola held onto Super Typhoon Status on the JTWC scale.[9] Meanwhile, Saola fell below the threshold for Violent Typhoon on the JMA scale that same afternoon.[10] Around the same time, the Hong Kong Observatory had announced that tropical cyclone warning signal number 8 (Tropical Storm) would be issued at 2:40 a.m local time on Friday, with the potential of this being raised to warning signal number 10 (Hurricane) as Super Typhoon Saola drew closer. It was warned that at some locations storm surges due to Super Typhoon Saola could reach historic levels, rivaling those of Typhoon Wanda in 1962 and Typhoon Hato in 2017.[11] This has since been upgraded at 6:20pm to an increasing gale or storm signal number 9, and later to the Hurricane Signal number 10 at 8:15pm, becoming the first time in 5 years that the highest warning signal was raised since Typhoon Mangkhut (Ompong) back in 2018.[12] Saola continued approaching near Southern China including Hong Kong with maintaining intensify Category 4 super typhoon. Saola then passed south of Hong Kong and Macau with another fluctuation between Category 3 and 4 before made landfall in Guangdong, China on early Saturday as a Category 3.[13] After its landfall, Saola weakened into a strong Category 2 typhoon. The Japan Meteorological Agency then downgraded Saola into a severe tropical storm a few hours after landfall. The JTWC later followed suit and downgraded Saola into a tropical storm by their next update as it moved further inland Guangdong. As convection waned over its center, the agencies downgraded the once-powerful Saola into a tropical depression by September 2. Saola had dissipated on September 3, with its remnants causing rainfall and stormy conditions across Southern China."

        "content": "Typhoon Rammasun, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Glenda, was one of the only four Category 5 super typhoons on record in the South China Sea, with the other ones being Pamela in 1954, Rai in 2021 and Yagi in 2024. Rammasun had destructive impacts across the Philippines, South China, and Vietnam in July\u00a02014. Rammasun is a Thai word for thunder god.[1] After Lingling and Kajiki earlier in 2014, Rammasun became the third tropical cyclone, and first typhoon to directly impact the Philippines in 2014. The ninth named storm and the third typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Rammasun formed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, an area near the equator where the northeast and southeast trade winds come together, and slowly drifted northwest. Having passed through the islands of Micronesia, the system turned west and quickly moved under the influence of a subtropical ridge (STR). Rammasun posed a significant threat to the Philippine island of Luzon, as it was expected to reach typhoon intensity before making landfall there.[2] Though initially forecast to make landfall in Cagayan Valley, the storm followed a more westerly path and was later forecast to make landfall in Rapu-Rapu, Albay in Bicol Region and then pass through Bataan and Zambales before brushing past Metro Manila.[3] In preparation for the storm, Governor of Guam Eddie Calvo declared the island in Condition of Readiness 3[4] and later upgraded it to Condition of Readiness 1. On July 11, NASA satellites revealed Rammasun passing directly over Guam.[5] The American National Weather Service stated that an unexpected rise in wind shear kept the system from intensifying much further before reaching Guam. Rammasun only made landfall on Guam as a tropical depression, with winds much weaker than earlier anticipated.[6] However, under the system, the island received a substantial amount of rainfall, making that day the wettest in around 3 months. The United States territory received 25 to 50\u00a0mm (0.98 to 1.97\u00a0in) of rain.[7] Along with the Philippines, Taiwan also expected impact from Rammasun. Moderate to heavy rainfall was predicted through most of the country.[8][9] Chinese meteorologists were focusing on second and/or third landfalls in the Chinese Hainan province and northern Vietnam. Residents of Hong Kong were also warned of rainfall and subsequent landslides.[10] Following the closure of maritime seaports, more than 100 passengers were reportedly stranded at the Port of Batangas, along with 39 rolling cargoes. Meanwhile, at least 841 passengers were stranded in five ports in the Bicol region, namely Matnog, Tabaco, Bulan, Cataingan and Pilar.[11] A total 50 flights were cancelled and over 100 thousand families were evacuated as the typhoon neared landfall.[12][13] The Philippine Department of Health said that they have prepared all government hospitals to aid the rescue and relief process during and after the typhoon. They claimed that they are much better prepared now, than they were for earlier typhoons.[14] Ahead of the landfall, a city in the province of Albay had declared a state of calamity.[15] At around 17:00 Philippine Standard Time (09:00 UTC), Rammasun's eye passed directly over Rapu-Rapu, Albay while the storm was at its initial peak intensity.[16] Various parts of the National Capital Region reported power outages during the storm. They were reportedly caused by \"a temporary system balance at 1:29 a.m. due to a sudden plant outage.\"[17] Laguna is one of the badly hit by the typhoon[18] At least 6,000 people were stranded at various seaports throughout the country due to the storm.[19]"

        "content": "On July 9, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a tropical disturbance, that had developed to the east of the Micronesian State of Chuuk.[20] At this time the system had a broad and ill-defined circulation center which was associated with flaring and disorganized atmospheric convection.[20] Over the next day the system gradually consolidated within an area of favorable conditions, with convection wrapping around the systems obscured low level circulation center.[21] The system was subsequently declared a tropical depression during the next day, by both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the JTWC with the latter assigning it the designation 09W.[22][23] Early on July 11, the JTWC reported that the system had intensified into a tropical storm, after they had assessed the intensity slightly higher than the Dvorak estimates from various agencies.[24] Later that day as the system approached Guam, the JTWC reported that the system had not intensified into a tropical storm and downgraded it to a tropical depression.[25] This was because of the lack of supporting Dvorak estimates from various agencies and various observations from Guam, that showed the system was a poorly defined low level circulation center with deep convection sheared to the northwest of the center.[25] Early on July 12, the JMA reported that the depression had become a tropical storm and named it Rammasun, as the system passed through the Rota Channel to the north of Guam.[26][27] Later that day as Rammasun moved westwards under the influence of the subtropical ridge of high pressure, the JTWC reported that it had regained tropical storm status after Dvorak estimates from various agencies supported it and the low level structure of the system had improved.[28] Rammasun entered the Philippine area of responsibility and was given a local name, Glenda on July 13.[29] The storm maintained intensity while a burst of deep central convection developed and the LLCC became slightly more well defined.[30] Over the next couple of hours, vertical wind shear decreased gradually. Rammasun tracked in a westerly direction along the periphery of the steering subtropical ridge. Outflow improved along the southwestern quadrant[31] and Rammasun became a typhoon.[32] The LLCC consolidated while convective banding became well defined and tightly wrapped. During July 14, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Rammassun to a typhoon after Dvorak estimates from various agencies suggested maximum sustained winds of 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph).[33][34] Shortly before its Philippine landfall, Rammasun developed a 10 nautical miles (19\u00a0km; 12\u00a0mi) wide eye. The storm had vigorous equatorward and westward outflow. At that time, the storm was peaking at 80 knots (150\u00a0km/h; 92\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained winds[35] and 75 knots (139\u00a0km/h; 86\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained winds.[36] Though initially expect to maintain that intensity and make landfall before weakening into a tropical storm again due to land interaction, Rammasun further intensified. Some six hours later, the JTWC spotted a 20 nautical miles (37\u00a0km; 23\u00a0mi) eye, twice as wide as previously reported. The 1-minute sustained winds were set at 100 knots (190\u00a0km/h; 120\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category 3 of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).[37] Rammasun continued to strengthen, despite land interaction. Post landfall, the storm's windspeed continued to rise, as it was located in a very favorable environment. JTWC initially reported winds of 110 knots (205\u00a0km/h; 125\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained winds[38] before correcting it to 115 knots (215\u00a0km/h; 130\u00a0mph) in their best track, making it a Category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon.[39] By 00:00 UTC on July 16, Rammasun's eye had re-emerged into the South China Sea. The typhoon lost its eye feature due to its interaction with Philippine's rugged terrain. The convective structure had slightly degraded. However, convective banding remained tightly wrapped around the LLCC.[40] On July 18, Rammasun entered another area of very warm sea-surface temperatures. Consequently, Rammasun rapidly deepened and was upgraded to a Category 4 super typhoon by the JTWC,[41][42] which was upgraded to Category 5 in post-season reanalysis. Later that day, Rammasun made landfall over Hainan at peak intensity,[43] making it one of only two typhoons to make landfall at Category 5-equivalent intensity in China.[44] During landfall, a station on Qizhou Island recorded a sea level pressure of 899.2 millibars, the lowest sea level pressure recorded in China and one of the lowest recorded sea level pressures in the world.[45] The next day, the storm started to weaken. Later that day, both agencies downgraded Rammasun to a tropical storm as it moved to the province of Guangxi and made its third landfall.[46][47] The JTWC made its final warning on the system in the night of the same day. Early on July 20, the JMA reported that Rammasun had weakened into a tropical depression before it was last noted later that day over the Chinese Province of Yunnan.[48][49][50]"

Preparations for Rammasun started in the island nation, early on July 14.[70] In the wake of the storm, The National Transmission Corporation of the country said in their statement, \"Preparations included ensuring the reliability of communications equipment, availability of hardware materials and supplies necessary for the repair of damages to facilities, as well as the positioning of line crews in strategic areas, to facilitate immediate restoration work.\"[71] Storm warning signal number 3 was hoisted over Catanduanes, while signal number 2 was raised over areas such as Camarines Norte, Burias Island, Ticao Island, Marinduque, and southern Quezon.[72] Several islands in southern Luzon and eastern western, and central Visayas were put under storm signal number 1. Over 12 million people, in all, were asked to brace for the typhoon. Classes on all levels were reportedly suspended for the next two days.[73] Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council's head Alexander Pama, in an interview, said \"We are already warning the public to be on alert for possible effects of the weather disturbance: landslides, flash floods, strong rains and winds.\" more than 1,300 villages were advised about floods or landslides.[citation needed] The Embassy of the United States in Manila cancelled non-immigrant visa applicant interviews scheduled for July 15 and 16. All applicants were asked to reschedule their interviews.[74] The Philippine Coast Guard asked all shipping vessels to refrain from travelling. Spokesperson Armand Balilo said \"Authorities are already on standby to prevent any maritime vessels from sailing as the Philippines braces for Glenda (Ramassun).[75] Department of the Interior and Local Government Director Edgar Tabell said \"All DILG offices in Luzon and Eastern Visayas have been activated to prepare for Glenda. Evacuation centers have been prepared and power lines, bridges and roads have also been checked.\" He also asked all local officials to fully cooperate with them and provide support to the residents.[76] As the typhoon neared the coastline of Philippines, the entire nation was put on red alert.[77] By the early hours of July 15, the government reportedly evacuated eastern coastal areas of the nation. PAGASA said \"Storm surges of up to three meters were expected in coastal villages.\"[78] However, that evening, several other residents fled their homes as the typhoon intensified much more than anticipated.[79] The civil defence chief of Bicol, in an interview said \"We are preparing for the worst... it is critical now that we finish the evacuations. About 6,000 residents had already moved to evacuation centres, with authorities aiming to have another 39,000 take shelter before the typhoon hits.[80] Several cities were warned of storm surge ranging from 1.5 metres (4\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) to 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft).[81] Immediately after the landfall, three fishermen were reported missing. They were reported to have gone out fishing a day ago from the Philippine province of Catanduanes, and failed to return.[82] A wall collapse in Quezon City injured two people.[83] At least 90% of the total residents of Metro Manila lost power, as poles were toppled and lines downed. The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines posted on Twitter, saying \"Around 90% of Meralco\u2019s franchise area is experiencing power outage brought about by downed poles, lines and outages of NGCP\u2019s (National Grid Corporation of the Philippines) transmission lines due to Typhoon Glenda.\"[84] Strong winds from the storm destroyed several homes in the slums. Most of the capital area was also completely shut down.[85] In total, Rammasun killed 106 people and caused a damage up to Php38.6 billion (US$885 million).[86]"

Twenty-two of the tornadoes (91%) were considered minor, rated EF0 or EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The remaining two tornadoes were rated as significant, at EF2.[1] The 24\u00a0tornadoes combined to cause $4.5\u00a0million in damage, and they did not cause any fatalities or injuries. The date range of the tornadoes was smaller than normal, lasting just over two months, from just June 17\u2013August 19. The first tornado date of June 17 marked the third-latest-starting tornado season on record in Minnesota since 1950, behind only 1951 (June 19) and 1952 (June 23).[2] The most unusual tornado event of the year occurred on August 19. Seven tornadoes were recorded in Minnesota that day, including one that touched down in Minneapolis. What made this day unusual is that a unique atmospheric setup allowed several of the tornadoes to be spawned from rain showers where no lightning was present.[3][4]"

Early on July 29, the depression showed signs of intensification and with that, JTWC upgraded it to Tropical Storm 11W. Later that day, JMA upgraded 11W to Tropical Storm Halong.[1] In the same time Halong started developing a small, unclear eye.[2] With this, gale and typhoon force winds were reported over Guam.[3] Very late on July 30, JMA upgraded Halong to a severe tropical storm. The next day, both agencies upgraded it to a minimal typhoon. In the same time, Halong started its rapid deepening phase.[4] On August 2, Halong's eye developed clearer than before as the system underwent explosive intensification from a category 1 typhoon to a Category 3 in less than 24 hours. Rapid deepening continued and it eventually became a category 5 super typhoon, with pressure dropping from 980 to 925 mbar in 48 hours.[5][6] However, late that day, JMA revised Typhoon Halong's minimum pressure to 920 mbar. On August 4, Halong weakened to a category 4 typhoon, due to it undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. The next day, Halong weakened to a minimal typhoon, although it was a deep typhoon due to its pressure. In the same day, its convection was steadily weakening.[7] On August 6, NASA reported that Halong was beginning undergo an eyewall replacement cycle. This made the JTWC upgrade it to a category 2 typhoon again.[8] Its eye continued to undergo the eyewall replacement cycle until August 8. On the same day, Halong weakened to a category 1 typhoon and started to affect mainland Japan.[9] The JTWC downgraded Halong to a tropical storm on August 9, while the JMA followed suit several hours later. Halong made landfall over the southern part of Japan prior to August 10.[10] On August 10, JTWC issued their final bulletin on Halong, as it was leaving the country.[11] The JMA also issued their final advisory on August 11, as it was becoming extratropical. Its remnants dissipated early on August 15 over Siberia, as it was absorbed by a developing extratropical system.[12]"

        "content": "Typhoon Vongfong, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Ompong, was the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2014, and struck Japan as a large tropical system. It also indirectly affected the Philippines and Taiwan. Vongfong was the nineteenth named storm and the ninth typhoon of the 2014 Pacific typhoon season. Estimates assess damage from Vongfong to have been over US$160 million, mainly for striking mainland Japan. At least 9 people were killed along the path of the typhoon in those countries. Both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Vongfong to a tropical storm on October 3.[1][2] Under low vertical wind shear and excellent outflow, Vongfong intensified into a typhoon east of Guam on October 5.[3][4] Afterwards, subsidence and moderate to strong vertical wind shear caused the typhoon to struggle to intensify.[5] On October 7, the PAGASA named the system Ompong, while it underwent rapid deepening owing to a TUTT cell.[6] The JTWC then classified Vongfong as the sixth super typhoon of 2014, shortly before reaching peak intensity with a round eye late on the same day.[7][8] Maintaining peak intensity for over one day, Vongfong began to gradually weaken on October 9, because of an eyewall replacement cycle.[9] On October 10, the structure of the typhoon decayed more, and it totally lost its eye feature on the next day when passing through Okinawa.[10] Due to mid-latitude westerlies, Vongfong's low-level circulation center became partially exposed. The typhoon accelerated east-northeastward on October 12 and made landfall over Kyushu.[11][12] The system continued passing through the main islands of Japan and weakened into a severe tropical storm on October 13, before it became extratropical on October 14.[13][14]"

        "content": "On September 30, a tropical disturbance began to persist near Ebon Atoll of the Marshall Islands, before the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor the system as a low-pressure area early on the next day.[15][16] Due to increased consolidation and favorable conditions, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early on October 2, shortly before the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression.[17][18] More than a half of day later, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression and designated it as 19W, as a microwave imagery has already revealed the formative banding.[19] When the tropical depression was tracking along the southern periphery of a deep subtropical ridge, the JMA started to issue tropical cyclone advisories at 00:00 UTC on October 3, shortly before the JTWC upgraded 19W to a tropical storm because of further consolidation.[2][20] In the afternoon, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Vongfong, when the fragmented banding was wrapping broadly into the slowly consolidating low-level circulation center with a weak eye-like feature.[1][21] Under low vertical wind shear and excellent outflow, the JTWC indicated that Vongfong had intensified into a typhoon at 06:00 UTC on October 4, as well as the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm at noon.[3][22] With an improved northeastward channel into a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell, the storm briefly formed a pinhole eye on October 5, and the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon approximately 330\u00a0km (210\u00a0mi) east of Guam at 09:00 UTC.[4][23] However, an area of subsidence north of the system and moderate to strong vertical wind shear began to impact Vongfong's development later.[5] The typhoon continued struggling to develop further early on October 6, as the broken convective banding was wrapping into a re-consolidating low-level circulation center.[24] In the second half of day, microwave imageries revealed that a thick eyewall structure had formed under a large central dense overcast, and a new but larger eye began to develop. Moreover, moderate vertical wind shear was being offset by excellent equatorward outflow and the motion of the system, when Vongfong was passing through the Northern Mariana Islands.[25] Once Typhoon Vongfong entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility shortly after 06:00 UTC on October 7, the PAGASA named it Ompong.[6] The system started to undergo rapid deepening early on that day, owing to low vertical wind shear and multiple outflow mechanisms including a TUTT cell positioned to the east. The JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon at noon, as the system had formed a 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) round eye surrounded by a symmetric annulus of intense convection.[7] Vongfong reached peak intensity six hours later, when the system's T-number of the Dvorak technique had increased to 7.5 according to both of the JMA and the JTWC, becoming the first tropical cyclone to reach that status since Haiyan in 2013. As the result, the JMA indicated that the maximum ten-minute sustained winds had increased to 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) and the system's atmospheric pressure had dropped to 900\u00a0hPa (27\u00a0inHg).[8] The JTWC also indicated that Vongfong had become equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, with maximum one-minute sustained winds at 285\u00a0km/h (177\u00a0mph). Additionally, although the typhoon was still generally tracking westward, it noticeably slowed down due to the weakening subtropical ridge.[26] The system continued maintaining peak intensity and tracked west-northwestward on October 8, although the JTWC indicated that the eyewall had slightly warmed.[27] Having remained at peak intensity for 18 hours and at Category 5-equivalent intensity for 30 hours, Vongfong began to gradually weaken due to an eyewall replacement cycle.[28] The JMA reported that Vongfong had become a large typhoon in the afternoon.[29] Moreover, the system started to track northward along the western periphery of an extension of the subtropical ridge, as well as the poleward outflow channel was slightly diminished owing to the filled (weakened) TUTT cell which previously enhanced outflow.[9] Early on October 10, the JTWC downgraded Vongfong to a typhoon, as the eye became more ragged and surrounded by elongated convection.[30] The typhoon then turned north-northwestward in the afternoon due to some migratory ridging building in the north, when excellent outflow was being enhanced along the poleward side because of the mid-latitude westerlies.[31] Vongfong totally lost the eye feature owing to increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear on October 11, yet its circulation grew even larger.[32] After crossing Okinawa Island and entering the East China Sea at 15:30 UTC, the overall structure of Typhoon Vongfong diminished more, resulting in the beginning of a significant weakening trend.[10][33] On October 12, the convective organisation was almost diminished, as the only remaining deep convection became contained to the northern flank. Moreover, cold air stratocumulus clouds were observed streaming into the western periphery of the system, as the low level circulation center had become partially exposed and elongated caused by strong vertical wind shear. Because of these reasons, the JTWC downgraded Vongfong to a tropical storm early on that day.[11] The system accelerated east-northeastward along the northwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge in the afternoon and made landfall over Makurazaki, Kagoshima at 23:30 UTC, right before the JMA downgraded Vongfong to a severe tropical storm only a half of hour later.[12][13][34] On October 13, Vongfong made landfall over Sukumo, K\u014dchi at 05:30 UTC, Awaji Island, Hy\u014dgo at 10:30 UTC and Izumisano, Osaka at 11:00 UTC, yet the system had started the extratropical transition because of the formation of weak fronts.[35][36] Isolated deep convection was displaced over the east quadrant of the exposed low-level circulation due to strong westerly vertical wind shear.[37] Vongfong became completely extratropical at 00:00 UTC on October 14, shortly after the system arrived at the area off the Pacific coast of the T\u014dhoku region.[14] Late on October 16, the extratropical system crossed the International Date Line.[38] The storm split into two systems south of the Alaska Peninsula during the afternoon of October 17; however, the low that constituted Vongfong's remnants was absorbed into the new storm only a few hours later, early on October 18.[39][40]"

Moreover, JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression with flaring and chaotic deep convection.[6][7] Late on the same day, JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and designated it as 08W for an increase in organisation of the low-level circulation centre.[8] The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Neoguri early on July 4, when a microwave imagery revealed that an eyewall was developing.[9][10] At 09:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Neoguri to a severe tropical storm, and then to a typhoon only three hours later, when the system continued tracking northwestwards along the southern periphery of a deep subtropical ridge.[11][12] Late on the same day, JTWC upgraded Neoguri to a typhoon, when the system had further consolidated with an almost continuous eyewall.[13] On July 5, Neoguri rapidly deepened and consolidated as curved banding wrapped tighter into a ragged 25\u00a0nmi (45\u00a0km; 30\u00a0mi) eye, owing to the robust all-around outflow.[14] At noon, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) gave it the local name Florita for entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[15] On July 6, the eye of Neoguri became highly symmetric and attained a large size with a diameter of 35\u00a0nmi (65\u00a0km; 40\u00a0mi), when the system was still tracking west-northwestwards along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge to the north.[16] A microwave imagery revealed a small intense convective core and improved convective bands over the southern semi-circle, as well as the radial outflow supported the ongoing intensification.[17] Late on the same day, JTWC upgraded Neoguri to a super typhoon for its contracted eyewall, although the secondary outer eyewall had begun to form.[18] Simultaneously, JMA analysed that Neoguri had reached peak intensity, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 95 knots (175\u00a0km/h; 110\u00a0mph) and atmospheric pressure at 930\u00a0hPa (27\u00a0inHg).[citation needed] Early on July 7, Neoguri began to track north-northwestwards along the southwest extension of a deep-layered subtropical ridge, when the JTWC reported that Neoguri had reached peak intensity as a Category 4 super typhoon with one-minute maximum sustained winds at 135 knots (250\u00a0km/h; 155\u00a0mph).[19] However, this was increased to 140 knots (260\u00a0km/h; 160\u00a0mph) in the best track, an upgrade to Category 5 super typhoon status. Under the influence of a very favourable environment, the system had an expansive areal coverage as tightly curved deep convective bands, mostly feeding from the southern flank, wrapped even tighter into the expanding and nearly annular eye.[20] However, the deep convection of the northwestern flank was almost eroded at noon, yet the round 40\u00a0nmi (75\u00a0km; 45\u00a0mi) eye maintained very well, prompting JTWC downgrading Neoguri to a typhoon late on the same day.[21][22] Although a digging mid-latitude trough was amplifying the upper-level poleward outflow and helping to maintain the intensity, it increased subsidence along the northwestern quadrant of Neoguri, which significantly hindered the development and caused a weakening trend.[23] From the evening to early July 8, overall convection of Neoguri significantly increased, when the typhoon began to turn northwards.[24] Later, Neoguri passed between Miyako-jima and Okinawa Island, right before starting to weaken gradually.[25] In the afternoon, convection of Neoguri began to diminish, as well as a noticeable dry slot formed along the eastern semi-circle.[26] The eye became obscured late on the same day, when the interaction with mid-latitude westerly trough was increasing.[27] Early on July 9, increasing vertical wind shear along the northwestern quadrant of Neoguri made deep convection erode very significantly.[28] Soon, JMA downgraded the system to a severe tropical storm when sharply turning eastwards, and cold stratocumulus clouds were streaming into a defined but elongating low-level circulation centre.[29][30] JTWC downgraded Neoguri to a tropical storm at noon, when the system was tracking along the periphery of the subtropical ridge modified by an approaching mid-latitude trough.[31] Right before 07:00 JST on July 10 (22:00 UTC on July 9), Neoguri made landfall near Akune, Kagoshima, and the system began to accelerate east-northeastwards.[25] Convection later continued to be greatly sheared southeastwards from the low-level circulation centre which was too broad, elongated, and unravelled to pinpoint, although the poleward outflow enhanced by the strong mid-latitude westerlies continued providing ventilation to the remnant wayward convection.[32] After Neoguri made landfall over the southern part of Wakayama Prefecture around 18:30 JST (09:30 UTC on July 10), JTWC issued the final warning to the fully exposed storm which was becoming extratropical with the forming frontal characteristics at noon, as well as JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm.[25][33][34] Neoguri then passed through Izu Peninsula around 02:30 JST on July 11 (17:30 UTC on July 10) and made landfall over Futtsu, Chiba right before 05:00 JST (20:00 UTC on July 10).[25] Early on July 11, Neoguri became an extratropical cyclone east of the Kant\u014d region and continued moving northeastwards.[35] After passing through Iturup and turning northwards late on the same day, the storm became below gale intensity at noon on July 12.[36][37] Neoguri completely dissipated in the Sea of Okhotsk one day later.[38]"

This resulted in widespread and prolonged flooding, especially in Yamagata Prefecture where 56\u00a0homes were inundated and evacuation orders were put in place for Shirataka. Rail service from Akayu Station was suspended due to rail line damage; repairs were expected to take until July\u00a022.[46] Total damage in Japan topped at \u00a564\u00a0billion (US$632\u00a0million).[47] The typhoon's passage pulled a warm air mass over Japan, resulting in a widespread heat wave with temperatures across eastern Honshu and Hokkaido rose to their highest levels in 2014. Temperatures peaked at 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00b0F) in Tatebayashi while Tokyo recorded 34.2\u00a0\u00b0C (93.6\u00a0\u00b0F); measurements reached 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F) in central Hokkaido.[48] Across eight prefectures, the high temperatures resulted in 1\u00a0fatality and 152\u00a0hospitalizations for heat stroke.[49] Neoguri also affected the Jeju Island. Parks and schools were closed,[50] while damage on the island were at \u20a9223\u00a0million (US$220,000).[51]"

It also developed its own mesoscale anticyclone that, in combination with the synoptic scale poleward and equatorward outflow, was providing an extremely efficient ventilation to the associated convection.[4] Thus, the JMA reported that Nuri had reached peak intensity late on that day, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) and atmosphere pressure at 910 hPa (26.87 inHg), when it was located about 520\u00a0km (320\u00a0mi) southwest of Okinotorishima.[3] The JTWC upgraded Nuri to a super typhoon at the same time, and the warning center even indicated that its one-minute maximum sustained winds had reached 285\u00a0km/h (177\u00a0mph) six hours later, unofficially recognizing it the strongest tropical cyclone in 2014, tied with Typhoon Vongfong and Typhoon Hagupit in terms of wind speed.[4] Initially, the JTWC forecast that Nuri would become a record-breaker as strong as Typhoon Haiyan; however, it failed to intensify further.[19] The system retained its impressive structure and turned northeastward along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge to the east on November 3, yet the JTWC indicated that it had begun to gradually weaken owing to warming cloud top temperatures in the afternoon.[20] Early on November 4, the JMA reported that Nuri had started to weaken, and the JTWC downgraded the system to a typhoon.[21][22] Although vigorous pole-ward outflow into a jet stream located to the northeast of the system offset increasing westerly moderate vertical wind shear, it continued undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, resulting a cloud-filled eye before noon.[5] Nuri still retained tightly curved banding wrapping into a well-defined LLCC;[23] however, on November 5, the LLCC began to unravel as the deep convection had become isolated to the northern semi-circle, although a weak microwave eye feature remained present. Vigorous poleward outflow into the mid-latitude westerlies became only partially offsetting the increasing vertical wind shear.[6] Right after the JMA downgraded Nuri to a severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on November 6, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm and issued their final warning for the system, due to the extratropical transition and diminishing deep convection.[24][25] In the afternoon, Nuri accelerated northeastward and became completely extratropical east of Japan.[26] Thanks to the unusually powerful North Pacific jet stream, the extratropical cyclone underwent extremely explosive cyclogenesis on November 7, owing to the energy from differences in air masses.[27] The system split into two centers of low pressure early on the same day, and the former center to the southwest was absorbed into the new center to the northeast within a half a day.[7][8] The resulting system became the most intense extratropical cyclones observed in the North Pacific Ocean since reliable records began, and indirectly contributed to below-average temperatures in North America.[28][29]"

Phanfone started as a large area of convection well west of the International Date Line. The system was well organized and classified as Tropical Depression 18W on September 29. At the same day, it gained the name Phanfone due to very favorable conditions and intense thunderstorms rich with convection surrounding the storm's center. Phanfone would later go rapid intensification on October 1 due to warm sea-surface temperatures and very favorable environments. JTWC upgraded Phanfone to a Category 4 typhoon but weakened later back to Category 3 due to its eye replacing the old one and undergoing a minor eyewall replacement cycle. Phanfone later entered the PAR, assigning the name Neneng. It left several hours later, maintaining its Category 3 strength. On October 4, Phanfone reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 super typhoon before steadily weakening. The typhoon later made landfall at Hamamatsu, Japan at the time of its extratropical transition. The system later moved over Southwestern Alaska and dissipated on October 12."

Late on September 30, the JMA upgraded Phanfone to a severe tropical storm, right before the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon.[4][5] After the JMA also upgraded Phanfone to a typhoon at noon on October 1, the system started to deepen more rapidly when tracking along the southwestern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge.[6] Under low vertical wind shear and good dual channel outflow enhanced by the mid-latitude westerlies to the north, Phanfone formed a pinhole eye early on October 2.[7] According to the JMA, Phanfone reached peak intensity with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) at 06:00 UTC, and it also became equivalent to the category 4 strength on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[8][9] Soon, the eye became cloud-filled and formed a secondary eyewall, suggesting an eyewall replacement cycle.[10] The PAGASA named the typhoon Neneng when it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility early on October 3.[11] In addition, Phanfone formed a ragged and large eye, indicating the completion of the eyewall replacement cycle.[12] Early on October 4, the JTWC upgraded Phanfone to a super typhoon when it was located about 170\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Minamidait\u014djima. As the system started to tap into the mid-latitude westerlies, it was in an area of strong vertical wind shear offset by vigorous outflow, namely the improved poleward channel.[13] Only six hours later, the JTWC downgraded Phanfone back to a typhoon owing to the loosening spiral banding.[14] At noon, the JMA analysed that Phanfone started to weaken.[15] The convective tops of the system intermittently warmed up afterwards, but the ragged and large eye still maintained well.[16] Phanfone sharply recurved and accelerated northeastward early on the next day, tracking along the western edge of the deep-layered subtropical ridge.[17] Typhoon Phanfone passed near the southern coast of Kii Peninsula around 03:00 JST on October 6 (18:00 UTC on October 5).[18] The eye immediately dissipated, as well as the system started to undergo extratropical transition right before making landfall near Hamamatsu of the Shizuoka Prefecture in Japan after 08:00 JST (23:00 UTC on October 5).[19] The JTWC issued the final warning to Phanfone early on October 6, and the system completely became extratropical at noon.[20][21] The storm stopped weakening and began to deepen again early on October 7, and it crossed the International Date Line as a powerful extratropical cyclone early the next day.[22] Post-Tropical Cyclone Phanfone, which was located about 890\u00a0km (555\u00a0mi) southwest of Unalaska, Alaska, reached peak intensity of its extratropical period at noon on October 8, with a barometric pressure of 948 hPa (27.99 inHg) and hurricane-force winds.[23] The system started to weaken again early on October 9, and it turned northward early on October 11.[24][25] The system eventually moved inland over Southcentral Alaska early on October 12 and dissipated later that day.[26][27]"

Because of this, the race had to be red flagged twice; the first time because the torrential rain made conditions too treacherous to race in and the second time because of a fatal accident involving Jules Bianchi, which was partially caused by the wet track conditions.[37][38] In Japan, a total of eleven people were killed by the typhoon, with several others missing or injured.[39] Heavy rains from the typhoon worsened the spread of radioactive materials in groundwater around the Fukushima I and Fukushima II nuclear power plants, which suffered nuclear meltdowns in 2011 following a MW9.0\u00a0earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Levels of the radioactive hydrogen isotope tritium soared ten-fold from the previous month to 150,000\u00a0becquerels per liter.

Thus, Hagupit weakened further, causing the JTWC to downgrade it to a typhoon early on December 6.[7][29] At 21:15 PST (13:15 UTC), Typhoon Hagupit made landfall over Dolores, Eastern Samar, with the 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph).[8][17] Half a day later, the system made its second landfall over Cataingan, Masbate and turned west-northwestward.[30] Owing to land interaction and its slow movement, the JMA downgraded Hagupit to a severe tropical storm on December 7 at 21:00 UTC.[31] The JTWC also downgraded Hagupit to a tropical storm early on December 8 right before the fragmented system made its third landfall over Torrijos, Marinduque.[32][33] After its fourth landfall over San Juan, Batangas at 17:45 PST (09:45 UTC), the JMA downgraded Hagupit to a tropical storm at noon.[9][34] On December 9, deep convection over the LLCC weakened significantly when Hagupit arrived at the South China Sea and turned westward, although good poleward outflow channel tapping into the mid-latitude westerlies helped the system sustain its minimal tropical storm intensity.[10] Soon after that, due to a marginally favorable environment, deep convection over the partially exposed LLCC increased again.[35] Hagupit briefly intensified in the afternoon on December 9, under moderate vertical wind shear offset by vigorous poleward outflow into the strong westerly flow to the north.[36] However, deep convection began to be displaced from the partially exposed LLCC one day after.[37] On December 11, despite favorable poleward outflow, Hagupit was not able to overcome upper-level subsidence in the southeastern quadrant and increasing vertical wind shear, as low-level northeasterly winds became completely out of phase with the upper-level.[38] Consequently, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical depression, and so did the JTWC.[11][39] The JTWC issued its final warning on Hagupit due to the LLCC of Hagupit being displaced from the deep convection and rapidly unraveling early on December 12.[40] Hagupit eventually dissipated southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, before noon on December 12.[41][42]"

Carmen was later upgraded to a typhoon on October 3, before forming an eye while moving northward. Carmen underwent rapid intensification into a super typhoon in the vicinity of Agrihan on October 6, as its center passed above the island of Pagan, where powerful winds of 150 knots (280\u00a0km/h; 170\u00a0mph) from the storm were recorded. The storm held onto this intensity until it began weakening from cold air on October 9. Carmen quickly shifted northeastward, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on the same day.

In Pagan, Carmen's peak wind speed were recorded, while in Agrihan, all of the houses were destroyed, along with schools, dispensaries, and other buildings. Subsistence crops were also destroyed, with coconut palms battered. Due to the damage, Agrihan lost its capability to support its inhabitants, prompting the residents to evacuate to Saipan.[2] After the effects, a rehabilitation task force was initiated on Pagan to supply aid, with rebuilding the airstrip being one of its top priorities. Although there were initially no funds for the project, the District Legislature later provided $7,000 to the District Administration, allowing the operation to commence.[5] Also in Agrihan, seven fishing boats sought shelter to southwest of the island, expecting that Carmen would pass east of the island. However, the storm's center passed the east coast of Agrihan, bringing severe storms at sea with an atmospheric pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg) and winds of 70 metres per second (250\u00a0km/h; 160\u00a0mph). The ships attempted to evade at full speed, but each ship was soon capsized. In total, about 1,290 tons of gross tonnage was lost, and 208 were reported missing, while one was killed.[6] Throughout the events, there were only two survivors from the ships.[7] A rescue search was conducted, rescuing three ships that had moved ashore along with 39 who landed on the island.[8]"

It officially began on June 1,[1] and lasted until November 30 of that year.[2] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The 1997 season was fairly inactive, with only seven named storms forming, with an additional tropical depression and an unnumbered subtropical storm. It was the first time since the 1961 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the entire month of August\u2013historically one of the more active months of the season\u2014a phenomenon that would not occur again until 2022. A strong El Ni\u00f1o is credited with reducing activity in the Atlantic, while increasing the number of storms in the eastern and western Pacific basins to 19 and 26\u00a0storms, respectively. As is common in El Ni\u00f1o years, tropical cyclogenesis was suppressed in the tropical latitudes, with only two becoming tropical storms south of 25\u00b0N. The first system, an operationally unnoticed subtropical storm, developed north of the Bahamas on June 1 and dissipated by the following day without any impact. Tropical Storm Ana developed offshore South Carolina on June 30 and dissipated on July 4, after causing minor affects in North Carolina. Hurricane Bill was a short-lived storm that lasted from July\u00a011 to July\u00a013 and produced light rainfall in Newfoundland. As Bill was dissipating, Tropical Storm Claudette developed and generated rough seas in North Carolina. The most devastating storm was Hurricane Danny, which caused extensive flooding, particularly in southern Alabama. Danny resulted in 9\u00a0fatalities and about $100\u00a0million (1997\u00a0USD) in damage. The outer bands of Hurricane Erika brought rough seas and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles, resulting in two deaths and $10\u00a0million in losses. The precursor to Tropical Storm Grace caused flooding in Puerto Rico, while Tropical Depression Five and Tropical Storm Fabian did not impact any land. Collectively, the storms of the 1997\u00a0Atlantic hurricane season resulted in 12\u00a0fatalities and approximately $111.46\u00a0million in damages."

Eight of the depressions attained tropical storm status, making 1997 the least active Atlantic hurricane season in the ongoing above-average era of tropical cyclogenesis, which began in 1995. Just three of these systems attained hurricane status and only one tropical cyclone intensified into a major hurricane,[10] which was below the 1981\u20132010 average of three per season.[3] Only Danny made landfall at hurricane strength during the season, although Hurricane Erika and Tropical Storm Grace also caused damage and fatalities. Those three cyclones collectively caused 12\u00a0deaths and $111.46\u00a0million in damage.[10][11][12][13][14][15] The last storm of the season, Tropical Storm Grace, dissipated on October 17, over a month before the official end of the season on November 30.[10] The 1997 Atlantic hurricane season had a very active beginning. In June, two tropical cyclones developed \u2013 the unnoticed subtropical storm and Tropical Storm Ana. An unusual four tropical cyclones formed in the month of July, three of which reached tropical storm intensity, and two of them became hurricanes. Despite the active start, the other months of the season featured record low activity, especially in August and September, both of which combined produced only one tropical cyclone. As a result of the active start and subsequent lack of activity, it showed that early season activity has no correlation to the entire season.[10] Further, this marked the first occurrence of no tropical cyclogenesis in August since 1961,[16] and the most recent instance of no activity in that month until 2022.[17] The lone tropical cyclone during the period was Hurricane Erika, which developed on September 3. In October, two short-lived tropical cyclones developed, Fabian and Grace. Tropical cyclogenesis ceased after Grace transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 17.[10] The season's activity was reflected with a low accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 41. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.[18]"

Simultaneously, Ana began to weaken, as it was moving into an area of decreasing sea surface temperatures.[20] By late on July 3, Ana weakened to a tropical depression. The storm also lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on July 4, over the western Atlantic Ocean. The extratropical remnants persisted until dissipating about twenty-four hours later.[20] Minimal impact was reported as a result of Ana, other than rip currents in coastal North Carolina.

After developing, the cyclone moved northeastward in advance of an approaching cold front. It quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Bill, and briefly threatened to pass near Bermuda. As a result, a tropical storm warning was issued, although it was quickly dropped; there was no impact on the island from Bill.[22] Bill quickly intensified as it continued northeastward. By midday on July 12, an eye feature was observed on satellite images, which suggested that Bill intensified into hurricane status at a relatively high latitude.

Because of the narrowness of that piece of land, most of Danny remained over water and it lost little strength. Danny re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened slightly making two landfalls in Alabama as a low-end Category\u00a01 hurricane on July 19. After remaining stationary for a day, Danny moved northward and weakened to a tropical depression. Heading northward across Alabama, Danny turned to the east and crossed over the Southeastern United States. While centered over North Carolina, Danny interacted with a developing trough, which caused it to re-intensify into a tropical storm. Shortly thereafter, Danny emerged over the Atlantic Ocean near the North Carolina\u2013Virginia border on July 24. Danny took a northward turn, and came within 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) of Nantucket Island on July 26. It then turned out to sea and was absorbed by a front on July 27.[11] Although Danny was a hurricane upon landfall, strong winds were confined to a small area, with only portions of extreme eastern Louisiana reporting hurricane-force winds.[27][28] Danny also dropped torrential amounts of rain in Louisiana, peaking at 11.40\u00a0in (290\u00a0mm) in Buras-Triumph.[29] Flooding occurred in portions of the state due to heavy rainfall. The floods and high winds produced by Danny damaged over 300\u00a0houses and more than 170\u00a0businesses in Louisiana alone.[27][28] In Mississippi, Danny dropped heavy rainfall on the southern portion of the state, resulting in minor street and house flooding.[30] As Danny crossed Dauphin Island, Alabama on July 19, it dropped 37.75\u00a0in (960\u00a0mm) of rain. This made Danny the wettest tropical cyclone on record in Alabama.[29][31] Hurricane force-winds were reported on Dauphin Island and the western shores of Mobile Bay. In the same area, many buildings had sustained roof damage. In addition, many homes on the Fowl and Fish Rivers reported significant damage.[32] Further north in South Carolina and Virginia, Danny spawned several tornadoes; some of them caused significant damage.[33] Heavy rainfall also occurred in some isolated areas; in central North Carolina between 8\u201312\u00a0in (200\u2013300\u00a0mm) of rain was reported.

        "content": "On October\u00a06, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, was associated with a circulation near the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Located in an area of warm sea surface temperatures of around 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C), the weather system experienced favorable conditions for tropical cyclone development, with low wind shear, spiraling rainbands, and outflow in two directions. At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system a tropical depression, and shortly thereafter, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert.[1][2] With weak steering currents from a subtropical ridge to the northwest, the nascent tropical depression drifted as it slowly organized. Early on October\u00a07, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 15W.[3][4] Later that day, the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Bolaven.[5] At first, the circulation of Bolaven was elongated and ill-defined, with a general movement to the northwest.[6] Despite the presence of dry air near the center, the storm slowly intensified as the convection deepened, and the outflow was amplified by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to its northeast.[7][8] Hot towers developed into tightly wound rainbands, a sign of a maturing tropical storm.[9] Late on October\u00a08, the JMA upgraded Bolaven to a severe tropical storm.[10] Some wind shear prevented quicker intensification, although there were signs of a developing eyewall as early as October\u00a09.[11] On October\u00a010, the JMA and the JTWC both upgraded Bolaven to typhoon status while the storm was approaching the Marianas Islands.[12][13] That day, the typhoon passed just south of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands (NMI).[14] As it moved away from the NMI, Bolaven underwent rapid intensification, developing a well-defined eye in the center of the convection. The JTWC described the environmental conditions as \"near ideal\", citing the low wind shear, high water temperature, and well-established outflow.[15] Early on October\u00a011, the JTWC upgraded Bolaven to a super typhoon, estimating sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). By that time, the storm had a well-defined 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) wide eye exhibiting the stadium effect.[16] The JTWC estimated that Bolaven peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 305\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph).[17] Thereafter, Bolaven began to weaken from increased wind shear.[18] Unfavorable conditions rapidly weakened Bolaven below super typhoon strength on October 13, as it recurved northeastward.[19] Bolaven began its extratropical transition on October 14, ceasing the issuance of bulletins from the JTWC.[20] The remnants of the storm went on to effect Alaska and British Columbia.[21]"

Won Pat International Airport.[14] Over 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rain were reported shortly after the storm passed through, and all citizens were asked to stay off roads due to dangerous conditions caused by the typhoon.[26] In Alaska, Ketchikan was put under a high wind warning as the remnants of the storm approached. Rainfall in Ketchikan was 6.69\u00a0in (170\u00a0mm) on October 17, a daily record.[27] After merging with another extratropical storm in the Gulf of Alaska, the remnants brought rain to parts of southern British Columbia, where Effingham Point, along the Sunshine Coast, recorded 276.4\u00a0mm (10.88\u00a0in).[28] Following the system's passage and impact to the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Coast Guard vessel Myrtle Hazard arrived with thousands of packages of pet food, and they assessed the other needs of people on the islands.[29]"

The city of  Fairbanks, nearby Fort Wainwright, and  Nenana saw record breaking water levels and widespread damage. Flooding was recorded over a large swath of the state, from  Eagle on the east to  Ruby on the west. Many major tributaries to the Yukon River saw flooding, including the  Salcha, Chatanika, Tolovana, lower  Tanana, and  Birch Creek rivers. The worst flooding occurred in the  White Mountains northeast of Fairbanks, although this area is sparsely populated. All of Fairbanks was flooded, and more than 12,000 people were evacuated. Fairbanks and Nenana were declared national disaster areas. Six deaths were reported, along with damage exceeding $170 million. Due to repeated previous flood damage, the community of Minto relocated nearly 20 miles to the north after this flood. As a result of the flood and to help prevent further disasters, stream and precipitation gauges were installed in the Chena River basin to monitor water levels. The  U.S. Congress also approved the Flood Control act of 1968, authorizing the building of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project, which includes the Moose Creek Dam, the Tanana River Levee, and various drainage channels."

In the last 400 years, there were only three major floods in the sediment record, with a recurrence interval of 125 years.[1]:\u200a400 On average, Fairbanks receives just over 11 inches of precipitation, either as rain or water equivalent. Roughly half of this is received from June through September as rain. By month, the averages are 1.39 inches for June, 1.84 inches for July, 2.20 inches for August, and 1.10 inches for September.

Major spring flooding from ice jams occurred in 1905, 1911, 1937 and 1948.[5][1]:\u200a394\u200a Rain produced flooding happened only in August of 1930 before the 1967 flood.[5] The majority of the flood risk in the Fairbanks area is due to spring break up.[4] However, ice jam flooding in the region is usually restricted, while rain cause flooding affects a much larger area.[1]:\u200a394 As early as 1930, residents of Fairbanks expressed concern about flooding from the Tanana River. Before 1945, a channel called Chena Slough branched off of the main channel of the Tanana river, and indicated that the Tanana River might be establishing its main channel further north upstream of Fairbanks.[6]"

In August, a large scale pattern brought arctic air from the northwest of Alaska and increased winds from the southwest.[7] This was in part due to the remnants of  Tropical Storm Hope and an arctic front west of Fairbanks that brought in an atmospheric river from the Pacific on August 8th through the 11th. On August 12th, weather conditions were similar to those found in squall lines in the Great Plains of the United States. From the 13th onwards, a low pressure from Bristol Bay brought even more precipitation into the area.[2] Rain was concentrated around central to eastern Interior Alaska, with much comparatively milder rainfall values in the Alaska Range and Denali National Park.[8]:\u200a11 Significant rainfall occurred from August 8th and lasted until around August 20th, although it was variable at times. At the Fairbanks International Airport, a record breaking 6.15 inches of rain was reported between August 8 and 15. On the 13th, the daily record of rain at the Fairbanks Airport was broken, with 3.61 inches of observed rain, which is still the highest daily total for that station.[8]:\u200a10\u200a Between August 10th and 15th, several areas of heavy rain were recorded, as much as 7.18 inches just north of Talkeetna.[2]"

It drifted to the southwest, then looped back to the northwest, becoming a tropical storm on August 18. Wayne, which remained embedded in the monsoon trough throughout its lifetime, turned to the northeast in response to a relocation of the trough, and became a typhoon according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on August 19, and on August 20 according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).[1] At 2 p.m. that day, the ship M. V. Fossarus recorded 78 knots (144\u00a0km/h) winds just west of its center.[2] The typhoon came close but remained offshore of southeastern China, and after reaching maximum sustained winds of 75 knots (139\u00a0km/h) it hit western Taiwan on August 22. The building subtropical ridge forced Wayne west and southwestward through the Luzon Strait, where after weakening to a tropical storm it restrengthened briefly to a typhoon on August 24, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.[3]  The JMA did not upgrade Wayne back to a typhoon during this segment of Wayne's existence.[1] Vertical shear caused Wayne to weaken to a depression on August 25 according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, and August 26 according to the JMA,[1] as the cyclone began to rotate around the circulation of Vera to its north. Tropical Depression Wayne sped up to the northeast, but when Vera moved far enough away, Wayne drifted northeastward through the South China Sea, becoming a tropical storm again on August 27. Ridging to its north forced Wayne southward, where it again became a typhoon on August 30 according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, and August 31 according to the JMA. Wayne passed close to northern Luzon on September 2 as a 75 knots (139\u00a0km/h) typhoon, but turned back to the west. The JMA lowered Wayne back to a tropical storm on September 3 before restrengthening the cyclone back into a typhoon by early September 4.[1]  On September 4 while moving quickly westward through the South China Sea, Wayne reached a peak of 85 knots (157\u00a0km/h) winds according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, or 70 knots (130\u00a0km/h) winds according to the JMA, before it weakened due to land interaction. It hit northern Hainan on September 5 as an 70 knots (130\u00a0km/h) typhoon. Its center passed just north of Haikou, where pressure fell to 970.1 hectopascals (28.65\u00a0inHg).[2] Wayne then entered the Gulf of Tonkin, and made its final landfall over Ha Nam Ninh in northern Vietnam later on that day, as a tropical storm. On September 6, Wayne dissipated over Vietnam/Laos border, after 85 JTWC advisories. The storm was one of the longest lasting Western Pacific tropical cyclones in recorded history.[3]"

In three northern provinces, the total cost of damage topped $10.6 million.[14] Joker Arroyo, aide to then-President Corazon Aquino, blamed severe flooding in Manila on the \"inefficient drainage system inherited from the previous administration\" of Ferdinand Marcos, who was overthrown in a revolt five months prior.[8] Total crop losses in the Philippines approached $27 million,[15] while property damage was estimated at $4.5 million.[16] In total, Peggy caused 109 casualties and $31.5 million in damage.[17]"

The International Finance Centre was closed, while taxis raised their prices to five times the normal trip.[14] Though the cyclone passed about 130\u00a0km (80\u00a0mi) east of the city, wind gusts up to 78 knots (144\u00a0km/h; 90\u00a0mph) were recorded at Tate's Cairn and rainfall totals that reached 449 millimetres (17.7\u00a0in) in Tai Mo Shan. These winds and torrential rainfall led to a landslide, partially collapsed a road, downed several trees, and resulted in flooding.[18] Throughout Guangdong, approximately 264,000 houses were destroyed and more than 100,000 others were damaged.[19][20] Officials estimated that some 785 villages were left in complete ruin and would have to be rebuilt.[21][20] Around 2,542 miles of high-tension wires were damaged,[22] and litch and sugar canes were flattened. About 1.35 million acres of farmland, a majority of that rice-paddy fields,[19] was flooded; 2,200 bridges were collapsed and 600 miles of telephone lines were downed.[15][22] At least 172 people were killed and an additional 1,250 were injured. Up to 510,000 people were stranded throughout the province, including 7,000 stranded in the city of Shantou and 100,000 stranded in the town of Meichen after the Meijiang River overflowed its banks.[19] and more than 2 million servicemen and civilians worked tirelessly to restore normal activities.[23] Early estimates put the amount of grain damaged throughout Haifeng and Lufeng counties around 100,000\u00a0short tons (91,000\u00a0t), and an official estimated that losses throughout Guangdong reached $470 million.[24][22] Thousands of people were mobilized for emergency services.[25] Farthest northeast, on the outskirts of Shanghai, the biggest tornado in 30 years swept through 20 villages and flattened about 1,300 homes, leaving 31 people dead and 690 more injured. A 20-ton crane in Chuangsha County was lifted and tossed onto a boat carrying cement. The roof was ripped off a silk factory, destroying approximately $270,000 worth of silk. Meanwhile, approximately 30,000 residents were rescued in Jiexi and Puning counties, where apartment buildings containing at least 23,000 homes were destroyed.[26] Tides up to 6\u00a0ft (2\u00a0m) above normal flooded the city of Shantou.[15] Offshore, a British naval vessel rescued 15 Taiwanese seamen after their 1,411-ton freighter, Hwa Lie, carrying electronic equipment and textiles from Taiwan to Hong Kong sank in rough seas.[27] President Aquino allotted $500,000 in relief aid for the 25 northern provinces, as well as another $25,000 for Manila alone.[18] The United States Embassy in Manila offered $400,000 to the Filipino Government and an additional $25,000 to the country's Red Cross.[24]"

A tropical depression formed on August\u00a013 and attained tropical storm intensity later that day. Initially, Vera meandered in the monsoon trough. On August\u00a017, however, the system abruptly re-formed to east-northeast, and subsequently began to move east and then north. Vera became a typhoon on August\u00a020, and peaked in intensity two days later. Typhoon Vera then turned west-northwest and slowly weakened as it approached Okinawa. After passing near the island, Vera turned north as it tracked east of China. The typhoon made landfall on South Korea on August\u00a028 as a tropical storm, and the next day, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The typhoon was responsible for minor damage to Okinawa, where 20,000\u00a0houses lost power and one fatality was reported. Although the core remained offshore China, over 500 homes were destroyed, 7\u00a0people died, and 28\u00a0people were hurt in Shanghai.

        "content": "Typhoon Vera formed from the most intense monsoon trough, which extended from the International Date Line to the Philippines, observed in the basin since 1974. Despite outflow from Tropical Storm Georgette, an area of low pressure embedded in the monsoon was first identified near Yap on August 12. Because the disturbance was one of many disturbances within the monsoon trough being tracked by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), a defined low-level circulation was difficult to spot on weather satellite imagery.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a013, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the system a tropical depression,[nb 1][4] after its center had become better defined. The persistence of deep convection prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert during the early morning hours of August\u00a014. Over the next 24 hours, the disturbance became better organized, and midday on August\u00a015, the JTWC upgraded it into a tropical depression.[2] Six hours later, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm.[nb 2][6] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm,[7] based on reports of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) winds from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft.[2] Tropical Storm Vera was initially expected to move west-northwest due to a strengthening subtropical ridge to the north; however, the storm continued to meander in the monsoon trough instead. A Hurricane Hunter aircraft on the afternoon of August\u00a016 failed to identify a low-level circulation. Satellite imagery on August 17 suggested that the storm's center became elongated. By 12:00 UTC on August\u00a017, however, a new circulation had become evident around 670\u00a0km (415\u00a0mi) to the east-northeast and quickly became Vera's dominant circulation. Post-season analysis from the JTWC indicated that the development of a separate circulation represented a new tropical cyclone;[2] however, the JMA considers the two circulations of Vera to be one continuous cyclone.[4] Initially, the re-developed system continued to meander,[2] while maintaining minimal tropical storm strength.[6] Vera then began to drift eastward under the influence of a trough located to the east of the monsoonal flow.[2] Early on August\u00a020, both the JTWC and the JMA classified Vera as a typhoon.[8][4] On August\u00a021, a ridge began to build towards the storm's east, forcing Vera to turn north.[2] On August 22, the JTWC estimated that Vera attained its peak intensity of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph)[8] while the JMA estimated a peak of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[4] Around this time, the typhoon passed about 540\u00a0km (335\u00a0mi) southwest of Iwo Jima.[9] Not long after attaining peak intensity, Typhoon Vera turned westward in the general direction of Okinawa.[2] The storm weakened as it approached land,[6] and late on August\u00a025, Vera tracked directly over the island,[2] with both the JTWC and JMA estimating winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[6] Vera's motion began to slow as the storm rounded a subtropical ridge to its north, and after reaching the western periphery of the ridge at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026, Vera turned to the northwest, and later to the north. Meanwhile, Vera began to lose tropical characteristics and transition into an extratropical cyclone. After passing almost 300\u00a0km (185\u00a0mi) east of Shanghai, Vera continued to weaken due to decreased outflow that was previously aided by the storm's connection to the monsoon trough. Midday on August\u00a028, Vera made landfall near the Kunsan Air Base in South Korea as a tropical storm. At 18:00\u00a0UTC, Vera cleared the Korean Peninsula. After accelerating towards the northeast, the JTWC estimated that Vera completed its transition on the morning of August\u00a029,[2] although the JMA continued to watch its remnants until September\u00a02.[4]"

Lower than normal pressures favored the building of convection over the trough. By the evening of September\u00a09, a pronounced area of disturbed weather developed southwest of the Truk Atoll. Aided by low wind shear, the disturbance developed slowly, even though the Hurricane Hunters initially failed to find a well-defined center. The disturbance drifted towards the northwest,[3] and early on September\u00a012, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system.[nb 1][5] Based on ship reports, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013.[3] Both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Abby at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014.[nb 2][7] On September\u00a014, Abby, while moving west-northwest,[2] began to develop a central dense overcast and thus began to intensify.[3] On the morning of September\u00a015, the JMA upgraded the system into a severe tropical storm.[5] Despite reports from Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicating that low-and upper-level circulations were not properly aligned,[3] both the JTWC and JMA estimated that Abby became a typhoon early on September\u00a016.[7] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, the JMA reported that Abby attained its maximum intensity of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[5] Six hours later, the JTWC estimated that Abby reached its peak intensity of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[8] Moving northwest,[2] the storm weakened slightly before making landfall in the eastern portion of Taiwan on September\u00a019; the JTWC estimated winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) at the time of landfall. Due to land interaction, the storm rapidly weakened,[3] with the low-level center re-curving towards the northeast.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, the JMA estimated that Abby weakened below typhoon intensity.[5] Twelve hours later, the JTWC stopped monitoring the system[3] while located 410\u00a0km (255\u00a0mi) southeast of Shanghai.[2] Around this time, the JMA reported that Abby transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, although the JMA continued to track the system through the morning hours of September\u00a024.[5]"

A witness reported that the tornado blew her barn and other buildings away, but the cows inside were untouched and still standing in their regular positions.

It killed 8 and injured 43 others.[1] Windspeeds were estimated to be between 261 and 318\u00a0mph (an average F5 speed).[3] The tornado had a width of around 1,500 yards and traveled a total of 30 miles during its lifetime.[2] Damage from the event could be referred to as EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, for some damage is not strong enough for an EF-5 rating.[2] Photos of the event were only present in a few newspapers during the time and are now preserved today."

The sixth internationally named storm of the season, Rumbia formed from a broad area of low pressure situated in the southern Philippine Sea on June\u00a027. Steadily organizing, the initial tropical depression moved towards the northwest as the result of a nearby subtropical ridge. On June\u00a028, the disturbance strengthened to tropical storm strength, and subsequently made its first landfall on Eastern Samar in the Philippines early the following day. Rumbia spent roughly a day moving across the archipelago before emerging into the South China Sea. Over open waters, Rumbia resumed strengthening, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 95\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) on July\u00a01,[nb 1] ranking it as a severe tropical storm. The tropical cyclone weakened slightly before moving ashore the Leizhou Peninsula late that day. Due to land interaction, Rumbia quickly weakened into a low pressure area on July 2 and eventually dissipated soon afterwards. Prior to moving over the Philippines, extensive preparatory measures were undertaken by local and government relief agencies. In the provinces of Eastern Visayas and Caraga, an estimated \u20b16.9\u00a0million was allocated to relief materials. Upon landfall, Rumbia caused extensive flooding across multiple islands, causing the cessation of transportation services and displacing thousands of people. Power outages also resulted from the heavy rain and strong winds. At its landfall on Leizhou Peninsula in China, Rumbia damaged large swaths of agricultural cropland and destroyed at least 112\u00a0buildings, causing \u00a51.17\u00a0billion (US$191\u00a0million) in damage."

        "content": "In late June\u00a02013, an area of disturbed weather persisted in the southern Philippine Sea, accompanied by a broad area of low pressure.[1] Moving northwestward under the influence of a subtropical ridge, the system organized in favorable conditions of low wind shear the following day.[1] At 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a027, the disturbance became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA); at the time the depression had winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1006\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.71\u00a0inHg).[nb 2][3] Three hours later, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\u00a0(PAGASA) upgraded the system to tropical depression status, designating it with the local name Gorio; however, the agency estimated weaker winds in the storm.[4] Throughout June\u00a028, the low-level circulation center of the depression consolidated and its rainbands intensified and organized around the center.[5] At 0300\u00a0UTC that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) also upgraded the system to tropical depression 06W.[6][nb 3] Nine hours later, the depression strengthened sufficiently to be upgraded to tropical storm intensity by JMA, giving the storm the international designation Rumbia;[8] the PAGASA followed suit three hours later.[9] As deep convection became more centralized, a decaying tropical upper tropospheric trough to the north of Rumbia suppressed polar outflow from the tropical storm, thus hampering further intensification.[10] The subtropical ridge to the northeast continued to force Rumbia towards the northwest, and by 0300\u00a0UTC on June\u00a029, Rumbia made landfall near Hernani, Eastern Samar as a tropical storm with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure estimated at 1000\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.53\u00a0inHg).[11][12] Rumbia later passed over Samar Island, and made additional landfalls on other islands in the Philippines before emerging into the South China Sea by 0300\u00a0UTC the following day;[13][14] upon emergence, the tropical storm maintained the same intensity as it had at its initial landfall.[11][15] Once in the South China Sea on June\u00a030, Rumbia steadily organized, with the storm's banding features becoming more well defined around the center. However, moderate wind shear still displaced much of the convection to the southwest.[16] Throughout the day, microwave imagery began to detect an eye developing within Rumbia, indicating strengthening.[17] At 2100\u00a0UTC that day, the tropical storm moved out of the PAGASA's area of responsibility, and thus the agency's last warning on the system was issued at that time.[18] A period of rapid intensification later ensued,[19] and at 0600\u00a0UTC on July\u00a01, the JMA upgraded Rumbia to severe tropical storm intensity; consequently, the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 95\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.09\u00a0inHg).[20] Three hours later, the JTWC reclassified Rumbia as a typhoon, indicating a wind speed increase of 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) in 24\u00a0hours.[19]"

The warnings were also expanded to include numerous provinces in Luzon.[21] Later that day, all preexisting warnings in Visayas and Mindanao were upgraded to signal No. 2 classification, while other areas of Visayas were issued new signal No. 1 warnings. In Luzon, the provinces of Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon, Masbate, Burias Island, and Ticao Island were upgraded to No. 2 warnings, while the provinces of Quezon, Polillo Island, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Marinduque, and Romblon remained under or were issued No. 1 warnings.[9] As Rumbia approached the coast, No. 1 warnings were expanded to include additional provinces, while No. 2 warnings generally covered the same areas up until landfall. All warnings in Mindanao were discontinued by 0300\u00a0UTC on June\u00a029, by which time Rumbia made landfall.[12] In Manila, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority's\u00a0(MMDA) Monsoon Task Force deployed 200\u00a0personnel to 11\u00a0station in the local metropolitan area to monitor flooding and traffic conditions, as well as assist in potential rescue situations. The authority also requested the dismantling of all outdoor advertisements and billboards. Army rescue trucks were also on standby in Guadalupe, Makati.[22] The Philippine government allocated \u20b16.9\u00a0million in relief funds to deal with the effects of Rumbia. The Department of Social Welfare and Development in Eastern Visayas activated rapid response teams and prepared 1,040\u00a0family food packs for potential delivery in disaster areas.

The twenty-fifth named storm and the sixteenth typhoon of the 2001 Pacific typhoon season, Faxai originated from a circulation in the monsoon trough. The system remained stationary for several days near Kosrae, pouring heavy rain that knocked down power. An indirect death occurred on the island as well. As the storm steadily intensified, Faxai moved west-northwestward at a very slow pace as it neared Pingelap, damaging crops, before bringing strong winds and rainfall that produced two landslides in Pohnpei on December 20. Intensity fluctuated, but convection in the core became more defined and by December 21, Faxai had intensified into a typhoon. A period of rapid intensification then followed, and by early December 23, Faxai reached its peak intensity. Preparations were ordered as Faxai approached the Mariana Islands, which included a state of emergency on Guam being declared. Faxai produced swells, causing rip currents that drowned a man in Guam. An eyewall replacement cycle was initiated as Faxai began to weaken. On December 24, Faxai recurved north-northeastward, approaching the island of Agrihan, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on Christmas Day. Agrihan endured powerful winds, but reported minimal damage. The storm's remnants were last marked far west-northwest of Midway Atoll on December 26, before dissipating on that same day. In total, Faxai caused damage of $1\u00a0million throughout the affected areas."

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Faxai are traced back to a low-latitude monsoon trough in the Caroline Islands that spawned a circulation.[1] Operationally, Faxai was designated the numeral identifier 31W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), as Faxai and another tropical cyclone were considered to be one tropical cyclone; however, post-season analysis determined that Faxai's low-level circulation center (LLCC) had developed near Kosrae after the dissipation of the other cyclone's circulation. As such, Faxai was re-designated as 33W.[2] On December 13, the system that became Faxai had intensified into a tropical depression southeast of Pohnpei.[3] For several days, the nascent cyclone stationed in the vicinity of Kosrae. It oscillated near the 5th parallel due to the broad and ill-defined center being difficult to locate.[1] Other factors encompass an interaction with a shear line that spanned toward the system from the northeast, a slightly weak subtropical ridge and a sequence of westerly wind bursts. During the period, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to a tropical storm early on December 15.[2] Though with no change in intensity, organization very slowly increased,[1] and by 18:00\u00a0UTC of the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system a tropical storm and gave it the name Faxai.[3] The tropical storm moved west-northwestward very slowly and entered a point 324\u00a0km (201\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Pohnpei on December 17.[1] Around later that day, the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager detected early stages of eyewall development. On December 18, Faxai remained nearly stationary before steering eastward, as the easterlies and the equatorial westerlies dragged the storm in between back and forth. Vertical wind shear around the storm increased due to the easterlies in the tropics and upper troposphere, starting a weakening trend. Early on December 20, Faxai commenced its northwestward path. Intensification of inner-core convection fluctuated as an outer rainband became more defined.[1] At 06:00\u00a0UTC, Faxai intensified into a severe tropical storm northeast of Pohnpei.[3] After continuous strengthening, the JTWC estimated that Faxai was a typhoon at 18:00\u00a0UTC,[2] followed by the JMA six hours later on December 21.[3] At that time, rapid intensification ensued for 18 hours, with 1-minute winds increasing from 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) to 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[2] An upper-level ridge north of Faxai slightly weakened, allowing poleward outflow to develop.[1] Faxai continued to strengthen rapidly, and after six hours, became the year's third and final super typhoon with winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph).[2] Additional intensification commenced with very conducive outflow and the primary rainband consolidating, and by the beginning of the next day, Faxai achieved its peak intensity;[1]  10-minute winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and the lowest atmospheric pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (27.02\u00a0inHg) were assessed by the JMA,[3] whereas 1-minute winds were assessed at 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph) by the JTWC.[2] Around that time, Faxai displayed concentric eyewalls holding a 15\u00a0km (9.2\u00a0mi) eye.[1] Not long after peak intensity, the compact irregular eye became cloud-filled, becoming replaced by a ragged banding eye feature, as wind speed began to decrease. Convection in the southeast quadrant began to wear off. Furthermore, dry air invaded the western side of the storm. On Christmas Eve, Faxai recurved about 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) east of Agrihan as it gradually weakened. The degrading was temporarily halted by a slight burst of deep convection as Faxai accelerated north-northeastward at 30\u00a0km/h (20\u00a0mph), before Faxai revealed signs of a transition into an extratropical cyclone. On Christmas Day, convection over the western portion greatly decreased.[1] The LLCC and convection, however, remained well-organized during the extratropical transition.[2] At 06:00\u00a0UTC, Faxai weakened back into a severe tropical storm.[3] The JTWC then declared that Faxai had completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone at 18:00\u00a0UTC. Moving east-northeastward at 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) on December 26, Faxai's remnants were last noted 1,200\u00a0km (750\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Midway Atoll by the JMA, before they dissipated at 12:00\u00a0UTC.[1]"

Throughout the previous day, the system poured 10.74\u00a0in (273\u00a0mm) of rain, and from December 13 to 18, 24.76\u00a0in (629\u00a0mm) of rain fell upon the island. Wind gusts of nearly 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) were recorded, with peak gusts assessed at 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph). An indirect death of a man occurred on the island and electrical power was knocked by heavy rainfall.[10] Damage to banana crops was also reported. The west shore of the island experienced coastal flooding, as many rocks were lifted onto the road of that shore. The storm then drifted west and tracked very near Pingelap on December 18, where winds of 45\u00a0km/h (29\u00a0mph) and gusts of 75\u00a0km/h (48\u00a0mph) were recorded. There, many banana trees were downed and some taro patches were damaged by sea water run-up. Faxai moved northwest slowly and on the 20th, produced strong winds of 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) in Pohnpei. The storm poured heavy rain of 80\u00a0mm (3.13\u00a0in) and caused flooding and two landslides in Nett,[11] as a constitutional convention was convened in Palikir.[12] Overall, Faxai caused $500,000 in property damage and $400,000 of damage towards crops in the Federated States of Micronesia.[11] Forecasts indicated that Faxai would pass near Guam on December 24. In response, typhoon watches were instated across the islands of Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan on December 22.[11] The Governor of Guam Carl Gutierrez declared a state of emergency and Typhoon Condition 3 as Faxai approached the territory.[13] The legislation of Guam authorized the use of $250,000 for mitigation and expenses associated with civil defense, public safety, or health emergencies; it was anticipated that Faxai had the potential to strike the island with powerful winds and inflict devastating damage.[14] The United States Air Force's 36th Wing deployed its civil engineering squadron to secure Andersen Air Force Base.[15] On December 22, a 69-year-old man drowned in Gun Beach, Guam from strong rip currents caused by swells from Faxai across the shoreline. He was given CPR before being transported to Guam Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Faxai recurved and headed more towards north, passing 571\u00a0km (355\u00a0mi) northeast of Guam on the afternoon of December 23, and later passed 290\u00a0km (180\u00a0mi) north-northeast of Saipan early on the following day. The storm passed east of Agrihan by only 72\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi). Despite the strong winds the island experienced, the ten residents of the island at the time all survived. The only damage occurred when a water well was flooded by saltwater, and was estimated to be $100,000.[11]"

Units from both MMDA and PNRC also responded to the call and pre-positioned its personnel along critical areas of Metro Manila. Trami killed 18 people in the Philippines and caused intensive flooding all over the nation. The system also intensified floods brought by earlier monsoonal rains in China, wreaking havoc.[16] In the final report by NDRRMC, 32 people were dead, while total damages were amounted to be P1.65 billion (US$37.7 million).[17]"

An area of disturbed weather formed near the Caroline Islands on July\u00a014. Shower activity gradually became better organized, and two days later, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression. On July\u00a018, the depression was classified as Tropical Storm Joe. Initially, Joe moved northwest, but began to turn to the west-northwest, anchored by a subtropical ridge to its north. Joe started to deepen at a faster clip, and attained typhoon intensity on July\u00a019. The eye began to clear out, and the next day, Joe reached its highest intensity. Shortly thereafter, Joe moved ashore the Philippines. There, 31\u00a0people were killed and 300,000\u00a0others were directly affected. Around 5,000\u00a0homes were destroyed, resulting in an additional 29,000 homeless. Damage in the nation was estimated at $14.5\u00a0million (1980\u00a0USD).[nb 1] The storm weakened rapidly over land, but re-intensified over the open waters of the South China Sea. Joe crossed the Leizhou Peninsula on July\u00a022, where it became the strongest system to hit the peninsula in 26\u00a0years. A total of 188\u00a0people were killed in the area. Further north, in Hong Kong, two people were killed and 59 were injured. After weakening slightly, Joe made its final landfall in Vietnam while still at typhoon intensity.

        "content": "An area of disturbed weather developed over the Caroline Islands on July\u00a014. Tracking westward, convective activity gradually increased in both convection and coverage.[1] At 18:00 UTC on July 22, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system.[2][nb 2] Less than four hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). On July\u00a016, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft found a weak surface circulation and minimum sea level pressure of 1006\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg). Initially, the low- and mid-level circulations were not vertically stacked, with the low-level center exposed from the deep convection. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a017, the surface center and the deep convection moved closer together, prompting the JTWC to classify the system as Tropical Depression 09.[1] Post-season analysis indicated that the depression had actually developed about 24\u00a0hours earlier than initially indicated.[4] Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Nitang.[5] Moving northwest in response to a shortwave trough an elongated area of lower air pressure aloft that was passing to its east,[1] the newly developed depression passed approximately 300\u00a0km (185\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Guam.[6] The depression began to develop at a quicker pace, and early on July\u00a018, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm.[7][nb 3] Six hours later, the JMA declared Joe a tropical storm.[2] At this time, the tropical system was located roughly 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) west of Guam.[6] Joe then began to move on a constant and brisk westward course that it would maintain for the rest of its life in response to an unusually strong subtropical ridge that was east of its climatological position and to the north of the cyclone.[1] After Joe developed a central dense overcast \u2013 a large mass of deep convection,[6] the JMA upgraded Joe into a severe tropical storm.[2] At midday, hints of an eye became apparent on satellite imagery,[6] which led to the JTWC and JMA upgrading Joe into a typhoon.[7] This intensity estimate was confirmed by a Hurricane hunter plane later on July\u00a019, which measured a pressure of 974\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg). An eye began to clear out on July 20. That same day, a Hurricane hunter aircraft recorded a pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[6] At midday, the JTWC estimated that Joe peaked in intensity, with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), equal to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). Meanwhile, the JMA estimated maximum intensity of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[7] Six hours after its peak, Joe made landfall in central Luzon.[1] At the time of landfall, the JMA indicated winds of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h).[2] Over land, Joe weakened rapidly, falling to tropical storm strength according to the JTWC.[1] After entering the South China Sea on July\u00a021, the JTWC expected Joe to turn northwest and threaten China. However, this did not occur due to the strong ridge to its north. Joe began to re-intensify; data from the JTWC suggested that Joe regained typhoon intensity almost immediately thereafter.[1] Around this time, the JMA estimated that Joe reached its secondary peak of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). At 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a022, the JTWC estimated that Joe attained a secondary peak of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) based on a Dvorak classification of T5.0. Despite maintaining its structure[1] as it tracked over the Leizhou Peninsula, the storm weakened as it entered the Gulf of Tonkin[6] and approached the coast of Vietnam.[4] Both the JTWC and JMA agree that Joe had winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) when it moved ashore near Haiphong in Vietnam later on July\u00a022.[1][7] A combination of land interaction and vertical wind shear resulted in rapid weakening. At 00:00 UTC on July\u00a023, the JTWC issued its last warning on Joe. The remnants of Joe later moved into Laos.[1] The JMA stopped watching Joe on July\u00a024.[2]"

Later that day, the signal was increased to a No 3. hurricane signal and then elevated to a No 8. hurricane signal. All signals were dropped late on July\u00a022, after Joe made its closest approach to Hong Kong. A minimum pressure of 1001.2\u00a0mbar (29.57\u00a0inHg) was recorded at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory (HKO) early on July\u00a022. Tate's Cairn recorded a peak wind speed of 87\u00a0km/h (54\u00a0mph) and a peak wind gust of 154\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) occurred in Stanley. HKO observed 61.9\u00a0mm (2.44\u00a0in) of rain over a 72-hour period. Within the vicinity of Hong Kong, two people were killed at a construction site in Kwai Chung. A total of 59\u00a0people were injured,[6] including seven that were hospitalized,[15] most from fallen debris. Three boats were also lost at sea after their anchors to the harbor broke. Air and sea traffic came to a halt. Overall, damage in the Hong Kong area was slight.[6] In Vietnam, 130\u00a0people were killed, 300,000\u00a0others were directly affected, and 165,000\u00a0others lost their homes.[10] An additional 15,800\u00a0buildings were destroyed, 16,300\u00a0homes were flooded, and many boats sunk.[16] The storm inundated 20,235\u00a0ha (50,000 acres) of rice paddies, uprooted trees, and blew off roofs from houses.[17] It also brought additional flooding to provinces of Ha nam ninh, Ha bac, Hai hung, and Ha son binh; these areas were already inundated by prior flooding.[18]"

Pabuk gradually intensified as it moved northwestward, getting upgraded to a typhoon by the JTWC on August 15, with the JMA following suit not too long after. By August 17, Pabuk briefly reached its initial peak strength as a low-end Category 2 typhoon before slowly weakening. The following day, Pabuk began to re-intensify. Pabuk also began to form an eye. By August 19, Pabuk reached its second peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). Pabuk grew in size, and its eye became irregular, hinting on a weakening trend while moving north northeastward. Pabuk weakened to tropical storm intensity when it hit the southern coast of Japan, south of Osaka, on August 21.

The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on September 1. It tracked northwestward, remaining disorganized and dissipating on the 5th. Another tropical depression developed to the east of the old circulation, quickly becoming the primary circulation and intensifying to a tropical storm on the 6th. With generally weak steering currents, Orchid looped three times on its track, strengthening to a typhoon on the 9th and reaching a peak of 95 mph winds on the 10th. Early on the 11th the storm hit southwestern Japan, and became extratropical that day over the Japan Sea. Orchid caused considerable damage from high winds and rain, resulting in at least nine casualties with 112 missing. It was also responsible for the loss of MV Derbyshire, believed to have sunk on 9 September with all 44 hands on board due to very rough seas. At 91,655 gross register tons, she is the largest British ship lost at sea.[1]"

Orchid exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility on September 10.[5] On the 9th of September, Typhoon Orchid sank one of the largest British ships, the MV Derbyshire, which went down with 42 crew, as well as 2 crewman's wives, 230 miles (370 km) from Okinawa.[6] Orchid soon made course towards the island of Kyushu. It headed north within a current and helped Orchid make landfall in Kyushu on September 10. After making landfall, Orchid fully transformed into its extratropical stage on September 11. It continued north into Primorsky Krai and into Vladivostok, but caused no known damage.[3][5] Orchid dissipated 5 days later, on September 16."

        "content": "Typhoon Betty, one of five tropical cyclones to develop in the Western Pacific basin during October 1980,[1] originated from a tropical disturbance that was first noticed on October\u00a022.[2] Five days later, the disturbance began to show signs of organization while it was located to the south of Truk Atoll.[3] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a028, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression.[4][nb 2][nb 3] Based on surface observations and data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 08:00\u00a0UTC. After initially moving south, the disturbance turned east as it approached Truk Atoll. Following an increase in the disturbance's organization, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 25 on October\u00a029[3] while the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm.[4] Six hours later, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Betty.[7] After moving erratically during its formative stages, Tropical Storm Betty accelerated towards the west-northwest as it passed south of Guam.[3] Late on October\u00a029, the JMA designated Betty a severe tropical storm.[4] Twenty-four hours later, the JTWC upgraded Betty into a typhoon,[7] with the JMA doing the same at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a031.[4] Twelve hours later, the JTWC raised the winds to 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph), equal to a low-end Category\u00a02 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).[2] On November\u00a01, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began to track the storm and assigned it with the local name Aring.[8] After turning due west,[3] Betty continued to intensify,[2] although a Hurricane Hunter penetration later on November\u00a01 indicated no eyewall.[3] Early on November\u00a02, synoptic data showed a shortwave trough moving off Asia. As such, the JTWC expected Betty to re-curve near the 125th meridian east. Instead, Typhoon Betty abruptly turned southwestward. On November 3, the trough moved quickly eastward north of the system, closing Betty's window for re-curvature.[3] Following the formation of an eye,[3] the JMA estimated that the typhoon peaked in intensity the next day, with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[4] Later that day, the JTWC estimated an intensity of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[2] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a04, the JTWC amended its forecast for Typhoon Betty, projecting it to move northwest into southern Luzon and China. At 16:00 UTC that day, Betty made landfall in central Luzon south of Cape San Ildefonso,[3] with the JTWC reporting winds of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph)[7] and the JMA estimating winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[4] As Betty weakened over land, a subtropical ridge to Betty's north broke down. Betty began to turn north in response to a shortwave through offshore Taiwan.[3] According to both the JTWC and JMA, the cyclone had weakened below typhoon intensity once it moved back over water.[2] Betty never regained its past intensity as it drifted northward, and at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a08, Betty was declared an extratropical system by the JTWC.[3] Twelve hours later, the JMA ceased tracking the system,[4] while the cyclone was located southeast of Honshu.[3]"

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Cyclone Funso were from an area of convection in the Mozambique Channel. On January\u00a017, a low-level circulation developed in the area as the convection organized into intense rainbands. An upper-level anticyclone provided favorable conditions for development, including weak wind shear and good outflow.[1] The system encountered warm sea surface temperatures, and favorable inflow from the south of its circulation was expected to increase after Subtropical Depression Dando dissipated over southern Africa.[2] Late on January\u00a018, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, indicating a high chance of the system becoming a tropical cyclone.[3] At 0000\u00a0UTC the next day, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MF) classified it as Tropical Disturbance\u00a08 about halfway between Mozambique and Madagascar in the northern Mozambique Channel.[4] About six hours later, the agency upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, after the convection became better organized.[5] The JTWC had also begun issuing advisories on the system by that time, labeling it Tropical Cyclone 08S.[6] Upon forming on January\u00a019, the depression was moving to the southwest along the northern edge of a ridge.[5] Though the system's low-level structure was disorganized, it gradually improved over the course of the day;[6] MF upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Funso at 1200\u00a0UTC on January\u00a019, or about 12\u00a0hours after its formation. Around that time, there was a warm spot, or a precursor to an eye, in the middle of a circular area of convection.[7] Funso rapidly intensified after the eye became better established, and the MF upgraded the storm to a tropical cyclone \u2013 the equivalent of a 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) hurricane \u2013 early on January\u00a020.[8] By that time, the outflow had increased significantly, partly due to an upper-level trough providing ventilation to the southeast.[9] Shortly after Funso intensified into a tropical cyclone, the eye disappeared on satellite imagery,[10] although this was due to the small size of the eyewall. Further intensification was forecast to be limited by the cyclone's interaction with the coast of Mozambique, as well as upwelling from its slow movement.[11] On January\u00a020, Funso turned to the west and slowed, due to its position between a ridge to the northwest of Madagascar and another ridge near the Mozambique\u2013South Africa border.[12] The convection to storm's west over land diminished while the center remained well-organized.[13] Despite land interaction, Funso intensified further, and the JTWC assessed 1\u00a0minute winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) early on January\u00a021, based on the appearance of a well-defined eye 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) in diameter.[14] Around the same time, MF estimated the storm attained 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph), making Funso an intense tropical cyclone. At the time, the storm was located about 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) east of Quelimane, Mozambique,[15] and its movement was nearly stationary.[14] By late on January\u00a021, however, Funso weakened due to land disrupting the convection. A building ridge to the north forced the cyclone to the southeast into an area favorable for re-intensification.[16] As the storm moved away from the Mozambique coastline, the convection became better organized,[17] and the eye gradually reformed.[18] Minimal wind shear, excellent outflow, and water temperatures of at least 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F) allowed for significant strengthening.[19] Late on January\u00a023, the JTWC estimated 1\u00a0minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph), and the agency forecast further strengthening to 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[20] Early the next day, MF estimated 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) about 330\u00a0km (210\u00a0mi) southeast of Quelimane, Mozambique.[21] After reaching peak intensity, Funso turned toward the southwest, due to a building ridge to its east.[22] Late on January\u00a024, the cyclone began an eyewall replacement cycle, which initiated a brief weakening trend.[23] MF remarked that Funso weakened below intense tropical cyclone intensity early on January\u00a025.[24] At the same time, the JTWC estimated the cyclone intensified further to peak 1\u00a0minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), based on estimates via the Dvorak technique. The agency noted that the eyewall replacement cycle finished and produced a well-defined eye 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) in diameter.[25] At 1200\u00a0UTC on January\u00a025, MF again upgraded Funso to an intense tropical cyclone,[26] and later that day the cyclone began another eyewall replacement cycle, and developed a larger eye measuring 55 kilometers across. Funso underwent another eyewall replacement cycle on January 27 as it started weakening.[27] On January 27, the government of Mozambique formally announced that the cyclone had begun to gradually weaken, in the early-morning hours. Cyclone Funso posed no imminent threat to the northeastern coast of South Africa. On January 28, Funso rapidly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, due to exposure to strong vertical wind shear, and colder sea surface temperatures below 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Funso's remnants continued moving eastward for the next few days, before dissipating on February 1."

At least 15 passengers drowned while dozens remain missing.[28] Although the core of the storm never made landfall in Mozambique, over three million people there were affected by tropical storm-force winds.[29] The most affected area was Zambezia Province, where twelve people[30] were killed by Funso, and 2,571\u00a0families were directly affected as of January\u00a023.[31] Seven of the fatalities occurred in the Maganja da Costa District, where 1,610 houses were destroyed,[32] and one death was in Zambezia's capital city of Quelimane, where heavy rainfall flooded most neighborhoods, owing to poor drainage systems. In the town, the flooding destroyed four houses, and several other cities along the coastline experienced flooding.[33] In Nicoadala District, the storm destroyed 66\u00a0houses and killed two people. Overall, more than 5000 people were displaced by the weather conditions.[34] In Chokwe, at least 3,900 hectares of rice fields[32] were flooded, while three people were missing in Guij\u00e1 District, Gaza Province on January 25.[35] After affecting the central Mozambique provinces, Funso brushed the coastline of the Inhambane Province in the south with rains and winds of 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph). At least 70,000 people were without a clean drinking water supply following the storm, and more than 56,000 were left homeless in Mozambique.[36] The cyclone hit the country about a week after Subtropical Depression Dando struck southern Mozambique, causing flooding and deaths.[31] Initial forecasts suggested that the cyclone would impact South Africa[37] or make landfall in southern Mozambique, but this became less likely as the storm continued tracking south. Nevertheless, some local tourists voluntarily evacuated the coastal city of Inhambane in Mozambique in anticipation of the storm.[38] In Malawi, a country adjacent to Mozambique, the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall, causing two rivers near Nsanje to exceed their banks and flood nearby villages.[39] Authorities were concerned about the fate of more than 450 families that lost their homes in the southern Nsanje District due to the effects of Funso, which mostly affected Bangula and Phokela, as three rivers overflowed.[40] Across Southern Malawi, the storm destroyed more than 320\u00a0houses and flooded 125\u00a0more, primarily in Bangula and Phokela.[40] As a result, about 5,000\u00a0people had to evacuate their homes during flooding on the Shire River and Ruo River, many of whom requiring rescue by helicopter or motorboat as they were stranded in the remaining unflooded areas of land.[41][42] At least 30\u00a0villages became isolated after flooding destroyed roads and bridges between Blantyre and Nsanje. The flooding also killed livestock and affected maize fields,[39] leaving whole communities at risk of starvation.[40] As the cyclone retreated southward, waves up to 11.5\u00a0m (38\u00a0ft) occurred on the coasts of southern Mozambique and western Madagascar.[32]"

Flooding also occurred in Inhambane Province.[31] Tens of thousands of people were made homeless in the floods, and authorities expected the casualty toll to rise.[45][46] Meteorologists predicted the flooding rains to continue for most of Mozambique throughout the first months of 2012.[31]"
