        "content": " A monsoon (/m\u0252n\u02c8su\u02d0n/) is traditionally a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation[1] but is now used to describe seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation associated with annual latitudinal oscillation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) between its limits to the north and south of the equator. Usually, the term monsoon is used to refer to the rainy phase of a seasonally changing pattern, although technically there is also a dry phase. The term is also sometimes used to describe locally heavy but short-term rains.[2][3] The major monsoon systems of the world consist of the West African, Asian\u2013Australian, the North American, and South American monsoons. The term was first used in English in British India and neighboring countries to refer to the big seasonal winds blowing from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area.[4][5]"

        "content": "Strengthening of the Asian monsoon has been linked to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau after the collision of the Indian subcontinent and Asia around 50\u00a0million years ago.[8] Because of studies of records from the Arabian Sea and that of the wind-blown dust in the Loess Plateau of China, many geologists believe the monsoon first became strong around 8\u00a0million years ago. More recently, studies of plant fossils in China and new long-duration sediment records from the South China Sea led to a timing of the monsoon beginning 15\u201320\u00a0million years ago and linked to early Tibetan uplift.[9] Testing of this hypothesis awaits deep ocean sampling by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.[10] The monsoon has varied significantly in strength since this time, largely linked to global climate change, especially the cycle of the Pleistocene ice ages.[11] A study of Asian monsoonal climate cycles from 123,200 to 121,210 years BP, during the Eemian interglacial, suggests that they had an average duration of around 64 years, with the minimum duration being around 50 years and the maximum approximately 80 years, similar to today.[12] A study of marine plankton suggested that the South Asian Monsoon (SAM) strengthened around 5\u00a0million years ago. Then, during ice periods, the sea level fell and the Indonesian Seaway closed. When this happened, cold waters in the Pacific were impeded from flowing into the Indian Ocean. It is believed that the resulting increase in sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean increased the intensity of monsoons.[13] In 2018, a study of the SAM's variability over the past million years found that precipitation resulting from the monsoon was significantly reduced during glacial periods compared to interglacial periods like the present day.[14] The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) underwent several intensifications during the warming following the Last Glacial Maximum, specifically during the time intervals corresponding to 16,100\u201314,600 BP, 13,600\u201313,000 BP, and 12,400\u201310,400 BP as indicated by vegetation changes in the Tibetan Plateau displaying increases in humidity brought by an intensifying ISM.[15] Though the ISM was relatively weak for much of the Late Holocene, significant glacial accumulation in the Himalayas still occurred due to cold temperatures brought by westerlies from the west.[16] During the Middle Miocene, the July ITCZ, the zone of rainfall maximum, migrated northwards, increasing precipitation over southern China during the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) while making Indochina drier.[17] During the Late Miocene Global Cooling (LMCG), from 7.9 to 5.8 million years ago, the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) became stronger as the subarctic front shifted southwards.[18] An abrupt intensification of the EAWM occurred 5.5 million years ago.[19] The EAWM was still significantly weaker relative to today between 4.3 and 3.8 million years ago but abruptly became more intense around 3.8 million years ago[20] as crustal stretching widened the Tsushima Strait and enabled greater inflow of the warm Tsushima Current into the Sea of Japan.[21] Circa 3.0 million years ago, the EAWM became more stable, having previously been more variable and inconsistent, in addition to being enhanced further amidst a period of global cooling and sea level fall.[22] The EASM was weaker during cold intervals of glacial periods such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and stronger during interglacials and warm intervals of glacial periods.[23] Another EAWM intensification event occurred 2.6 million years ago, followed by yet another one around 1.0 million years ago.[19] During Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events, the EASM grew in strength, but it has been suggested to have decreased in strength during Heinrich events.[24] The EASM expanded its influence deeper into the interior of Asia as sea levels rose following the LGM;[25] it also underwent a period of intensification during the Middle Holocene, around 6,000 years ago, due to orbital forcing made more intense by the fact that the Sahara at the time was much more vegetated and emitted less dust.[26] This Middle Holocene interval of maximum EASM was associated with an expansion of temperate deciduous forest steppe and temperate mixed forest steppe in northern China.[27] By around 5,000 to 4,500 BP, the East Asian monsoon's strength began to wane, weakening from that point until the present day.[28] A particularly notable weakening took place ~3,000 BP.[29] The location of the EASM shifted multiple times over the course of the Holocene: first, it moved southward between 12,000 and 8,000 BP, followed by an expansion to the north between approximately 8,000 and 4,000 BP, and most recently retreated southward once more between 4,000 and 0 BP.[30]"

        "header": "Australian monsoon",
        "content": "The January ITCZ migrated further south to its present location during the Middle Miocene, strengthening the summer monsoon of Australia that had previously been weaker.[17] Five episodes during the Quaternary at 2.22 Ma ([clarification needed]PL-1), 1.83 Ma (PL-2), 0.68 Ma (PL-3), 0.45 Ma (PL-4) and 0.04 Ma (PL-5) were identified which showed a weakening of the Leeuwin Current (LC). The weakening of the LC would have an effect on the sea surface temperature (SST) field in the Indian Ocean, as the Indonesian Throughflow generally warms the Indian Ocean. Thus these five intervals could probably be those of considerable lowering of SST in the Indian Ocean and would have influenced Indian monsoon intensity. During the weak LC, there is the possibility of reduced intensity of the Indian winter monsoon and strong summer monsoon, because of change in the Indian Ocean dipole due to reduction in net heat input to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Throughflow. Thus a better understanding of the possible links between El Ni\u00f1o, Western Pacific Warm Pool, Indonesian Throughflow, wind pattern off western Australia, and ice volume expansion and contraction can be obtained by studying the behaviour of the LC during Quaternary at close stratigraphic intervals.[31]"

        "header": "Process",
        "content": "Monsoons were once considered as a large-scale sea breeze[32] caused by higher temperature over land than in the ocean. This is no longer considered as the cause and the monsoon is now considered a planetary-scale phenomenon involving the annual migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone between its northern and southern limits. The limits of the ITCZ vary according to the land\u2013sea heating contrast and it is thought that the northern extent of the monsoon in South Asia is influenced by the high Tibetan Plateau.[33][34] These temperature imbalances happen because oceans and land absorb heat in different ways. Over oceans, the air temperature remains relatively stable for two reasons: water has a relatively high heat capacity (3.9 to 4.2 J g\u22121 K\u22121),[35] and because both conduction and convection will equilibrate a hot or cold surface with deeper water (up to 50 metres). In contrast, dirt, sand, and rocks have lower heat capacities (0.19 to 0.35 J g\u22121 K\u22121),[36] and they can only transmit heat into the earth by conduction and not by convection. Therefore, bodies of water stay at a more even temperature, while land temperatures are more variable. During warmer months sunlight heats the surfaces of both land and oceans, but land temperatures rise more quickly. As the land's surface becomes warmer, the air above it expands and an area of low pressure develops. Meanwhile, the ocean remains at a lower temperature than the land, and the air above it retains a higher pressure. This difference in pressure causes sea breezes to blow from the ocean to the land, bringing moist air inland. This moist air rises to a higher altitude over land and then it flows back toward the ocean (thus completing the cycle). However, when the air rises, and while it is still over the land, the air cools. This decreases the air's ability to hold water, and this causes precipitation over the land. This is why summer monsoons cause so much rain over land. In the colder months, the cycle is reversed. Then the land cools faster than the oceans and the air over the land has higher pressure than air over the ocean. This causes the air over the land to flow to the ocean. When humid air rises over the ocean, it cools, and this causes precipitation over the oceans. (The cool air then flows towards the land to complete the cycle.) Most summer monsoons have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain (because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air). The intensity and duration, however, are not uniform from year to year. Winter monsoons, by contrast, have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside and cause drought.[37] Similar rainfall is caused when moist ocean air is lifted upwards by mountains,[38] surface heating,[39] convergence at the surface,[40] divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface.[41] However the lifting occurs, the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, and this produces condensation."

The semiarid Sahel and Sudan depend upon this pattern for most of their precipitation."

It pushes as far west as the Peninsular Ranges and Transverse Ranges of Southern California, but rarely reaches the coastal strip (a wall of desert thunderstorms only a half-hour's drive away is a common summer sight from the sunny skies along the coast during the monsoon). The North American monsoon is known to many as the Summer, Southwest, Mexican or Arizona monsoon.[47][48] It is also sometimes called the Desert monsoon as a large part of the affected area are the Mojave and Sonoran deserts. However, it is controversial whether the North and South American weather patterns with incomplete wind reversal should be counted as true monsoons.[49][50]"

        "header": "Southwest monsoon",
        "content": "The southwestern summer monsoons occur from June through September. The Thar Desert and adjoining areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent heat up considerably during the hot summers. This causes a low pressure area over the northern and central Indian subcontinent. To fill this void, the moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean rush into the subcontinent. These winds, rich in moisture, are drawn towards the Himalayas. The Himalayas act like a high wall, blocking the winds from passing into Central Asia, and forcing them to rise. As the clouds rise, their temperature drops, and precipitation occurs. Some areas of the subcontinent receive up to 10,000\u00a0mm (390\u00a0in) of rain annually. The southwest monsoon is generally expected to begin around the beginning of June and fade away by the end of September. The moisture-laden winds on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula, due to its topography, become divided into two parts: the Arabian Sea Branch and the Bay of Bengal Branch. The Arabian Sea Branch of the Southwest Monsoon first hits the Western Ghats of the coastal state of Kerala, India, thus making this area the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest Monsoon. This branch of the monsoon moves northwards along the Western Ghats (Konkan and Goa) with precipitation on coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. The eastern areas of the Western Ghats do not receive much rain from this monsoon as the wind does not cross the Western Ghats. The Bay of Bengal Branch of Southwest Monsoon flows over the Bay of Bengal heading towards north-east India and Bengal, picking up more moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The winds arrive at the Eastern Himalayas with large amounts of rain. Mawsynram, situated on the southern slopes of the Khasi Hills in Meghalaya, India, is one of the wettest places on Earth. After the arrival at the Eastern Himalayas, the winds turns towards the west, travelling over the Indo-Gangetic Plain at a rate of roughly 1\u20132 weeks per state,[51] pouring rain all along its way. June 1 is regarded as the date of onset of the monsoon in India, as indicated by the arrival of the monsoon in the southernmost state of Kerala. The monsoon accounts for nearly 80% of the rainfall in India.[52][53] Indian agriculture (which accounts for 25% of the GDP and employs 70% of the population) is heavily dependent on the rains, for growing crops especially like cotton, rice, oilseeds and coarse grains. A delay of a few days in the arrival of the monsoon can badly affect the economy, as evidenced in the numerous droughts in India in the 1990s. The monsoon is widely welcomed and appreciated by city-dwellers as well, for it provides relief from the climax of summer heat in June.[54] However, the roads take a battering every year. Often houses and streets are waterlogged and slums are flooded despite drainage systems. A lack of city infrastructure coupled with changing climate patterns causes severe economic loss including damage to property and loss of lives, as evidenced in the 2005 flooding in Mumbai that brought the city to a standstill. Bangladesh and certain regions of India like Assam and West Bengal, also frequently experience heavy floods during this season. Recently, areas in India that used to receive scanty rainfall throughout the year, like the Thar Desert, have surprisingly ended up receiving floods due to the prolonged monsoon season. The influence of the Southwest Monsoon is felt as far north as in China's Xinjiang. It is estimated that about 70% of all precipitation in the central part of the Tian Shan Mountains falls during the three summer months, when the region is under the monsoon influence; about 70% of that is directly of \"cyclonic\" (i.e., monsoon-driven) origin (as opposed to \"local convection\").[55] The effects also extend westwards to the Mediterranean, where however the impact of the monsoon is to induce drought via the Rodwell-Hoskins mechanism.[56]"

        "header": "Northeast monsoon",
        "content": "Around September, with the sun retreating south, the northern landmass of the Indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly, and air pressure begins to build over northern India. The Indian Ocean and its surrounding atmosphere still hold their heat, causing cold wind to sweep down from the Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain towards the vast spans of the Indian Ocean south of the Deccan peninsula. This is known as the Northeast Monsoon or Retreating Monsoon. While travelling towards the Indian Ocean, the cold dry wind picks up some moisture from the Bay of Bengal and pours it over peninsular India and parts of Sri Lanka. Cities like Chennai, which get less rain from the Southwest Monsoon, receive rain from this Monsoon. About 50% to 60% of the rain received by the state of Tamil Nadu is from the Northeast Monsoon.[57] In Southern Asia, the northeastern monsoons take place from October to December when the surface high-pressure system is strongest.[58] The jet stream in this region splits into the southern subtropical jet and the polar jet. The subtropical flow directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern Asia, creating dry air streams which produce clear skies over India. Meanwhile, a low pressure system known as a monsoon trough develops over South-East Asia and Australasia and winds are directed toward Australia. In the Philippines, northeast monsoon is called Amihan.[59]"

It is characterised by a warm, rainy summer monsoon and a cold, dry winter monsoon. The rain occurs in a concentrated belt that stretches east\u2013west except in East China where it is tilted east-northeast over Korea and Japan. The seasonal rain is known as Meiyu in China, Jangma in Korea, and Bai-u in Japan, with the latter two resembling frontal rain. The onset of the summer monsoon is marked by a period of premonsoonal rain over South China and Taiwan in early May. From May through August, the summer monsoon shifts through a series of dry and rainy phases as the rain belt moves northward, beginning over Indochina and the South China Sea (May), to the Yangtze River Basin and Japan (June) and finally to northern China and Korea (July). When the monsoon ends in August, the rain belt moves back to southern China."

        "content": "The rainy season occurs from September to February and it is a major source of energy for the Hadley circulation during boreal winter. It is associated with the development of the Siberian High and the movement of the heating maxima from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere. North-easterly winds flow down Southeast Asia, are turned north-westerly/westerly by Borneo topography towards Australia. This forms a cyclonic circulation vortex over Borneo, which together with descending cold surges of winter air from higher latitudes, cause significant weather phenomena in the region. Examples are the formation of a rare low-latitude tropical storm in 2001, Tropical Storm Vamei, and the devastating flood of Jakarta in 2007. The onset of the monsoon over Australia tends to follow the heating maxima down Vietnam and the Malay Peninsula (September), to Sumatra, Borneo and the Philippines (October), to Java, Sulawesi (November), Irian Jaya and northern Australia (December, January). However, the monsoon is not a simple response to heating but a more complex interaction of topography, wind and sea, as demonstrated by its abrupt rather than gradual withdrawal from the region. The Australian monsoon (the \"Wet\") occurs in the southern summer when the monsoon trough develops over Northern Australia. Over three-quarters of annual rainfall in Northern Australia falls during this time."

The winds pick up again in June, which is why this phenomenon is also referred to as \"the return of the westerlies\".[61] The rain usually arrives in two waves, at the beginning of June, and again in mid- to late June. The European monsoon is not a monsoon in the traditional sense in that it doesn't meet all the requirements to be classified as such. Instead, the return of the westerlies is more regarded as a conveyor belt that delivers a series of low-pressure centres to Western Europe where they create unsettled weather. These storms generally feature significantly lower-than-average temperatures, fierce rain or hail, thunder, and strong winds.[62] The return of the westerlies affects Europe's Northern Atlantic coastline, more precisely Ireland, Great Britain, the Benelux countries, western Germany, northern France and parts of Scandinavia."

The first tropical cyclone of the 1918 Atlantic hurricane season, it was first detected south of Barbados on August\u00a01. Moving west-northwest, the storm traversed the Caribbean Sea and gradually strengthened, though the sparse observations available did not sample the storm's intensity. On August\u00a05, the storm attained hurricane intensity after moving through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel into the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane strengthened further into a major hurricane before making landfall near Cameron, Louisiana, on August\u00a06 with maximum sustained winds of around 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h). The storm quickly moved north-northwest into Texas and Oklahoma while rapidly weakening, and eventually dissipated on August\u00a07 over eastern Oklahoma. Due to a lack of observations and the hurricane's small size, the major hurricane struck Louisiana with little advance warning. The hurricane quickly moved through southwestern Louisiana, limiting rainfall accumulations in the storm's path. However, the hurricane produced damaging winds with gusts reaching about 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) in Sulphur and exceeding 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) in Lake Charles. The most severe damage occurred in those areas, with many buildings destroyed. Corn and cotton crops also suffered from the strong winds. Along the coast, buildings in Grand Chenier and Creole were swept by storm surge. The hurricane killed 34\u00a0people in Louisiana, and the Weather Bureau estimated the total damage toll to be around $5\u00a0million.[b]"

The tropical cyclone passed south of Jamaica on August\u00a03 and moved through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel into the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a05.[1][4] Maritime observations suggested that the storm intensified into a hurricane by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05 north of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[5] The United States Weather Bureau did not receive any reports regarding the between the afternoon of August\u00a04 and the morning of August\u00a06, by which time air pressures had already begun to fall along the U.S. Gulf Coast.[1] A 2008 reanalysis of the storm conducted by the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory estimated that the hurricane reached the equivalent of Category\u00a03 intensity on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale by 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06, making it a major hurricane.[d][5][4] At around 17:30\u00a0UTC that day, the hurricane made landfall 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) east of the Sabine River near Cameron, Louisiana, with maximum sustained winds of approximately 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h). A minimum air pressure of 960\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.35\u00a0inHg) was observed in Sulphur, Louisiana, implying that the hurricane had a minimum central pressure of about 955\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.20\u00a0inHg). The hurricane was slightly smaller than average at landfall, with a radius of maximum winds extending 17\u00a0mi (27\u00a0km) from its center.[5] The storm continued to the north-northwest after landfall with a forward speed of around 18\u00a0mph (29\u00a0km/h),[1][5] crossing the Sabine River into Texas south of Merryville, Louisiana,[7] and moving along the state border between Louisiana and Texas as it rapidly weakened. The 2008 reanalysis determined that the storm dissipated over eastern Oklahoma after 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07.[5]"

A Weather Bureau forecast published on the morning of August\u00a06 remarked that \"A tropical disturbance is evidently approaching the Gulf coast,\" but that the point of landfall could not be determined.[8] Hurricane warnings were ultimately issued by the Weather Bureau for the Louisiana coast and the Texas coast east of Galveston during the afternoon just prior to landfall, though the agency also provided antecedent notices of a tropical storm in the area. The swath of significant damage resulting from the small hurricane spanned 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) across,[1] with impacts felt between Orange, Texas, and Jennings, Louisiana.[9] Minor to negligible damage occurred along the hurricane's periphery. The center of the hurricane moved through Cameron, Calcasieu, and Beauregard parishes in Louisiana,[1] and the most destructive impacts of high winds sustained in Cameron and Calcasieu parishes.[7] The hurricane killed 34\u00a0people in Louisiana and injured at least 68. The Weather Bureau estimated that total property and crop damage amounted to around $5\u00a0million, but this figure excluded the damage in smaller villages and lost livestock.[1] The heaviest property damage occurred at Gerstner Field, Lake Charles, Louisiana, Lockmoor, and Sulphur. Fires indirectly caused by the hurricane caused limited additional damage. Strong winds also wrought significant damage to cotton and corn crops in extreme southwestern Louisiana.[7] The rice crop sustained comparatively less severe losses due to their recent planting.[1] The storm surge produced by the hurricane raised tides at Morgan City 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) above normal and Johnson Bayou 2.4\u00a0ft (0.73\u00a0m) above normal. Higher surge heights likely occurred but were unmeasured over eastern Cameron Parish.[1] The hurricane's quick passage of Louisiana led to relatively low rainfall accumulations despite the moderate to heavy rainfall ahead of the storm and on its eastern flanks.[10] Rainfall amounts generally ranged between 2\u20133\u00a0in (51\u201376\u00a0mm) along the Louisiana coast over a 24-hour period,[10] with 2\u20134\u00a0in (51\u2013102\u00a0mm) rainfall totals over southwestern and south-central Louisiana.[7] A peak rainfall total of 4.91\u00a0in (125\u00a0mm) was measured near Franklin,[11] and only one weather station recorded over 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain in a 24-hour period.[10] Rain from the hurricane also extended into Texas along the state border with Louisiana.[12] The storm surge razed homes in Grand Chenier and Creole.[9] The mail and passenger Borealis Rex departed from Cameron en route to Lake Charles early on August\u00a06 when it encountered the hurricane. Strong winds pushed the vessel into the shoreline as it entered Prien Lake, whereupon the passengers sought refuge in a nearby home. As winds switched from the north, the boat was pushed a mile downstream and capsized in 8\u201310\u00a0ft (2\u20133\u00a0m) waves. All passengers survived the hurricane.[1][9] At Garstner Field, 7\u00a0hangars and 96 airplanes were destroyed. Three pilots were killed.[9] An anemometer in Lake Charles recorded a maximum five-minute sustained wind of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) with gusts estimated to be in excess of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h);[1][9] the instrument was disabled by either debris or the strong wind after measuring the maximum wind speed.[1] A string of freight cars in Lake Charles were blown into the rear of a train, smashing the vehicles and killing 25\u00a0people.[13] The Temple Sinai was severely damaged while the old Presbyterian church was demolished. A portion of the Methodist Episcopal Church was detached and disintegrated. The Goosport milling district was ravaged by a combination of strong winds and fire, with a red glow in the sky visible 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) away in DeQuincy.[9] In DeQuincy, at least 50 residences were destroyed while several churches and stores were rendered useless. Three people were killed in the city, and another three deaths occurred at Hammond Camp to its east.[14] Westlake was described as \"a scene of desolation\" with a majority of its buildings leveled.[9] Wind gusts as high as 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) were reported in Sulphur.[9] Automobiles in Sulphur were stripped of their tops and laid on their bodies. Many buildings were unroofed or otherwise pushed off their foundations.[15] Few businesses remained standing, with The Union Sulphur Mines suffering most severely.[9] A large warehouse was blown across a set of railroad track in Vinton.[15] Oil fields adjacent to Vinton and Edgerly sustained what was described as \"great damage,\" and rice crops across Calcasieu and Jefferson Davis parishes saw their stalks broken or bent.[16] In Lafayette, Louisiana, travel came to a standstill as wreckage from homes and toppled communication lines littered roadways. The Pierce Oil Corporation Building collapsed upon a number of occupants, resulting in minor injuries. Several other structures caught fire as they collapsed upon hot stoves, though heavy rainfall inflicted by the hurricane helped to quell the resultant flames. Losses from the city topped $1 million.[17] In the aftermath of the storm, soldiers patrolled the debris-littered streets in an effort to combat looting and civil unrest.[18] The Big Lake Gunnery School, one of the only buildings at Gerstner Field intact in the storm's wake, was used as a base for relief work.[9]"

        "content": " Hurricane Lisa was a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane that caused extensive and destructive flooding across Belize and other parts of northern Central America in November 2022. Lisa was the fourteenth tropical cyclone, twelfth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season. The cyclone developed from a tropical wave that entered the Caribbean Sea on October 25. The wave spawned a broad low-pressure area on October 28, which gradually consolidated into a tropical storm on October 31, and received the name Lisa. Lisa gradually intensified as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean, becoming a hurricane on November 2 over the inlet Gulf of Honduras. Lisa achieved peak intensity late that day as a strong Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg), while making landfall near the mouth of the Sibun River in Belize. Lisa quickly deteriorated as it crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, weakening to a tropical storm early on November 3, and further to a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC[a] that day. Tropical Depression Lisa emerged over the Bay of Campeche, where it failed to reorganize and opened up into a trough on November 5. The hurricane caused significant destruction in Belize, severely damaging many homes, schools and businesses, several of which reported complete roof failure. Around 5,000 homes were damaged in Belize, with an additional 500 being completely destroyed. Total damages from the storm in Belize were estimated at US$100 million.[b] Additional damage from flooding and mudslides were reported in Guatemala and parts of southern Mexico, while lesser effects were felt from the storm in Honduras. Despite the considerable destruction, no deaths were reported from Lisa. Lisa was one of only two November hurricanes to strike Belize on record, along with the unnamed 1942 Belize hurricane.[2]"

        "content": "A low-latitude, westward-moving tropical wave left the west coast of Africa on October 17, 2022. The system featured sporadic thunderstorm activity, but westerly wind shear prevented development over the tropical Atlantic. The wave crossed the Lesser Antilles  into the Caribbean Sea on October 25 while gradually slowing down. The system interacted with a large mid-level trough as the latter moved eastward across the central Caribbean, spawning a broad area of low pressure on October 28. Dry air left behind by the trough, coupled with continued westerly wind shear, initially prevented development of the low-pressure area as it continued slowly westward. However, it gradually became better organized as conditions became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis on October 30.[1] Although the system had not yet become organized enough to be declared a tropical cyclone, due to its impending threat to bring tropical storm conditions to Jamaica and Grand Cayman, advisories were initiated on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen at 21:00 UTC that day by the United States\u2013based National Hurricane Center (NHC).[3] More concentrated convection developed over the disturbance's center the following day, leading to the formation of a well-defined surface circulation. Thus, the system became a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC October 31 about 150 nautical miles, or 173\u00a0mi (278\u00a0km), south of Kingston, Jamaica, as it was already producing gale-force winds; accordingly, it was named Lisa by the NHC.[c][1] Lisa initially intensified slowly due to continued westerly wind shear, as well as dry-air intrusions into its newly-formed circulation. The storm turned west-northwestward under the influence of a ridge to its north. However, reduced shear and dry-air intrusions allowed the small cyclone to begin to steadily intensify on November 1, acquiring a more symmetric appearance and expanding outflow. Entering the Gulf of Honduras in the northwestern Caribbean, Lisa strengthened to a hurricane by 12:00 UTC November 2. Lisa developed an eye that afternoon as it neared the coast of Belize, and the hurricane made landfall about 11.5\u00a0mi (18.5\u00a0km) southwest of Belize City around 21:30 UTC that day. Lisa concurrently reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg), a strong Category 1 hurricane.[1] Lisa quickly weakened as it moved inland over northern Central America; however, a portion of its circulation always remained over water during its nearly 36-hour passage over land, allowing the system to maintain its status as a tropical cyclone. Lisa weakened to a tropical storm early on November 3 and further to a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC that day. Lisa emerged over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, in the Bay of Campeche, just after 6:00 UTC November 4. Despite being back over water, Lisa continued to weaken due to increasing southwesterly shear and entrainment of dry air into its circulation, as it slowed down and turned to the north. The weak depression degenerated to a trough of low pressure by 12:00 UTC November 5, about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) northeast of the city of Veracruz.[1]"

The highest recorded amount of rain fell at the Mayan ruin site of Altun Ha, peaking at 8.43\u00a0in (214\u00a0mm), although it is estimated that up to 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) of rain fell in northeastern Belize. A storm surge of 3-5 feet (0.9-1.5 meters) inundated much of the coastline of Belize, particularly in the Belize District in the northeastern portion of the country, and water levels were raised by as much as 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) above normal tide levels near and to the north of Lisa's center onshore.[6] Reports of strong winds, fallen trees, and power line and roof damage were reported as far inland as the Cayo District in the western Belize. Nearly 5,000 homes were damaged across Belize, and a further 500 were completely destroyed. 6,500 families were severely affected by Lisa across the country.[1] A total of 172,000 people were impacted by the hurricane, and at least 5,000 were temporarily displaced by its passage into state-run shelters.[7] Much of Belize City, the country's largest city, was inundated with water at the height of the storm, and suffered particularly severe damage.[1][8] The area was left without power and potable water during and immediately following Lisa's passage, as the storm uprooted trees, downed power lines and flooded streets. Widespread roof damage also occurred.[5] While no detailed damage reports were provided by Belizean authorities, significant damage to infrastructure, utilities, agriculture, and boats were reported across the country, with many of them centered on Belize City and the nearby village of Ladyville.[6] About 1,221 people were housed in shelters in Belize City. Several parts of the Belize power system required extensive repairs following the storm.[9] Total damage from Lisa across Belize was estimated at US$100 million.[1] Following the hurricane, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), a regional division of the World Health Organization, sent a Disaster Response Team to assist in recovery from Lisa. Medical kits, food and water, and hygiene products were among the supplies distributed. PAHO also coordinated with Belize's Ministry of Health and Wellness to survey for food-borne illnesses and possible disease outbreaks following the storm.[7] A disaster response emergency fund was launched by the Belize Red Cross to assist over 1,000 families affected by the storm.[6]"

The storm continued to generate heavy rainfall over parts of the area as it turned north into the Gulf of Mexico.[11] The cyclone disrupted the World Wide Technology Championship of the PGA Tour in Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo, forcing players to seeks shelter and disrupting games.[12]"

Urban flooding can be caused by stormwater runoff, riverine flooding and structural failure when engineered flood management structures, including dams and levees, prove inadequate to manage the quantities and force of flood waters. Floods can also occur when groundwater levels rise entering buildings cracks in foundation, floors and basements.[1][2] Flooding is part of the natural environmental process.[2][3] Flooding along large river systems is more frequent in spring where peak flows are often governed by runoff volume due to rainfall and snowmelt,[4] but can take place in summer [5] with flash floods in urban systems that respond to short-duration, heavy rainfall.[6] Flooding due to hurricanes, or downgraded severe storms, is a concern from August to October when tropical storms can affect Eastern North America.[7] Flood events have had a significant effect on various regions of the country. Flooding is the costliest natural disaster for Canadians. Most home insurance claims in Canada deal with water damage due to sewer back-up, not fire.[8] Floods occur five times as often as wildfires, the second most frequent natural hazard in Canada.[1]:\u200a6\u200a Between 1900 and 2005 there were 241 flood disasters in Canada.[1]:\u200a6\u200a[notes 1] The 1894 Fraser River flood had a return period of slightly more than 500 years and the 1948 flood was close to a 200-year event.[9]:\u200a22\u200a The 1997 Red River flood was named the 'flood of the century'.[10] The International Joint Commission (IJC)'s[notes 2] 1998 report warned that although the 1997 Red River flood had a \"return interval ranging from 100 to 500 years, depending on the location\", there was a \"statistical probability of a similar flood each year.\"[11] The 2011 Assiniboine River Flood was estimated to have a return interval of 300 years.[12] The Calgary flood had a return interval ranging from 70 to 100 years.[13][14] A 100-year flood has a 1-percent annual exceedance probability (AEP) flood.[notes 3][15][16][notes 4] with a flow of the Bow River in Calgary measured at c.1,740\u00a0m3/s (61,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) when the flood reached its peak level on June 21, 2013.[13][14]"

The flood was significant in both height and breadth.[21] In 2008, Northwest Hydraulic Consultants (NHC) recommended the adoption of the following flood frequency estimates at the Hope gauge on the Fraser River: 100 year daily maximum flow 14,700\u00a0m3/s (520,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s); 200 year daily maximum flow 15,600\u00a0m3/s (550,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s); 500 year daily maximum flow 16,800\u00a0m3/s (590,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). The Fraser's highest recorded flow, in June 1894, is estimated to have been 17,000 cubic metres per second (600,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) or within a range of about16,000 to 18,000 cubic metres per second (570,000 to 640,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) at Hope.[9] Based on these flows, the 1894 flood had a return period of slightly more than 500 years and the 1948 flood was close to a 200-year event.[9]:\u200a21\u200a Of the two catastrophic floods on the Lower Fraser River since European settlement in the Fraser Valley, the flood of 1894 is considered to be the \"flood of record\", but the flood of 1948 caused greater damage because of \"intensive development\" on the flood plain.[9]:\u200a1"

Over 4,000 families were left homeless.[33]:\u200a13 Sandink argued that there are major discrepancies in cost estimates for flood damage in general and for Hurricane Hazel in particular. Neither insurance companies nor governments cover the full damage.[1]:\u200a10\u200a The Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada estimates the total cost of Hurricane Hazel for Canada, taking into account long-term effects such as economic disruption, the cost of lost property, and recovery costs, as being $137,552,400 CAD.[34] University of Western Ontario Geography professor Dan Shrubsole estimated the costs at about $2,000,000,000 CAD (2008).[18] Environment Canada estimated the flood damages at $25,000,000 (1954) or $205 million (in 2008 dollars) In the Toronto area, winds reached 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) per hour and there was 285\u00a0mm (11.2\u00a0in) of rain in 48 hours.[35] The Humber River, located in the west end of the city, caused the most destruction, as a result of an intense flash flood. Toronto's infrastructure took a heavy hit. Not built to withstand serious flooding, as it is in a climate area that does not see exceptionally prolonged or heavy rainfall, over 50 bridges, many part of important highways, were heavily damaged or put out of commission, when high water itself washed them out or debris in the water smashed them. Numerous roads and railways were also washed out.[34] At the peak of the flooding, the Don River's flow rate was 1,680\u00a0m3/s (59,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). Normally the Don River flow is 10\u00a0m3/s (350\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) rising to 100\u00a0m3/s (3,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) during the spring. By 1959, as a result of Hurricane Hazel, a regional approach to flood control and water management was adopted in Ontario and by 1959 the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) finalized a comprehensive Plan for Flood Control and Water Conservation, which included the proposed development of large dams and major flood control channels, with future plans for an erosion control program and the acquisition of 7,300 acres of land.[36]"

The International Joint Commission (IJC)'s 1998 report warned that although the 1997 Red River flood had a \"return interval ranging from 100 to 500 years, depending on the location\", there was a \"statistical probability of a similar flood each year.\"[11] It was the most severe flood of the river since 1826. Flooding in Manitoba resulted in over $500 million in damages, although the Red River Floodway, an artificial waterway affectionately known as \"Duff's Ditch\" saved Winnipeg from flooding. This flood stimulated improvements to the flood protection system. In Manitoba flood waters reached 21.6\u00a0ft (6.6\u00a0m), which caused 28,000 people to be evacuated and $500 million CAD in damage to property and infrastructure.[40][41] The 1997 Red River Flood resulted in large DFAA payments.[39] The flood came close to overcoming Winnipeg's existing flood protection system.[42] At the time, the Winnipeg Floodway was designed to protect against a flow 60,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (1,700\u00a0m3/s), but the 1997 flow was 63,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (1,800\u00a0m3/s).  To compensate, the province broke operational rules for the floodway, as defined in legislation, during the night of April 30 / May 1, preventing waters in Winnipeg from rising above the designed limit of 24.5\u00a0ft (7.5\u00a0m) above the \"James Avenue datum\", but causing additional flooding upriver.  The mayor of Winnipeg, announcing what should have been the bad news that the design limit had been reached, misinterpreted this as good news that the flooding had peaked.  City sand-bagging stopped, and national reporters left the city, but the water continued to rise inside and outside of the city[43] until the actual peak late on May 3 / early on May 4.

Mean precipitation across Canada increasing by about 12%.[72] the high Arctic received the largest percentage increase in precipitation. From the 1950s through 2002, the Prairies experienced little change or a decline. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)'s Climate Research Division summarized annual precipitation changes, evaluating records up to 2007. They observed: \"Precipitation has generally increased over Canada since 1950 with the majority of stations with significant trends showing increases. The increasing trend is most coherent over northern Canada where many stations show significant increases. There is not much evidence of clear regional patterns in stations showing significant changes in seasonal precipitation except for significant decreases which tend to be concentrated in the winter season over southwestern and southeastern Canada. Also, increasing precipitation over the Arctic appears to be occurring in all seasons except summer.\"[73] Changing annual precipitation patterns can affect spring flood conditions on large river systems but would generally not affect flash flooding in urban systems. ECCC climate specialists have also assessed trends in short-duration rainfall patterns affecting flash flooding. Data include annual maximum observations at climate stations, documented in Engineering Climate Datasets.  ECCC notes: \"Short-duration (5 minutes to 24 hours) rainfall extremes are important for a number of purposes, including engineering infrastructure design, because they represent the different meteorological scales of extreme rainfall events.\" A \"general lack of a detectable trend signal\", meaning no overall change in extreme, short-duration rainfall patterns, was observed. In relation to design criteria used for urban drainage design (e.g., Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) statistics), the evaluation \"shows that fewer than 5.6% and 3.4% of the stations have significant increasing and decreasing trends, respectively, in extreme annual maximum single location observation amounts.\" On a regional basis, southwest and the east (Newfoundland) coastal regions generally showed significant increasing regional trends for 1 and 2 hour extreme rainfall durations. Decreasing regional trends for 5 to 15 minute rainfall amounts were observed in the St. Lawrence region of southern Quebec and in the Atlantic provinces.[74] In some instances, future predicted changes in short term rainfall extremes have been misreported as historical changes. A theoretical one-standard deviation shift in mean extreme rainfall intensity has been misreported as Environment Canada data, suggesting that storms occurring every 40 years are occurring every 6 years\",[8] based on a standard, normal probability density function (see presentation 13:10). It has also been reported that 20 times more storms are occurring than 20 years ago, and that this is affecting urban flood water damages and insurance premiums - ECCC has commented that there are no such significant changes in storm patterns.[75]"

It was reported that annual mean streamflow has generally decreased, with significant decreases detected in the southern Canada. Also monthly mean streamflow decreased for most months with greatest decreases in August and September. In March and April, significant increases in streamflow were observed suggesting the potential for greater spring flooding in large, gauged river systems. Daily streamflow frequency increased significantly over northern British Columbia and the Yukon Territory, and decreased significantly in southern Canada, in all percentiles of the daily streamflow distribution.[76] Significantly earlier breakup of river ice and resulting spring freshet occur in British Columbia consistent due to spring warming trends.[73] There was no evidence to suggest changes in the frequency of heavy precipitation events (daily rainfall/snowfall larger than a threshold value which is exceeded by an average of three events per year) across Canada.[73] Flow rates and flood risks in small un-gauged drainage systems throughout urban areas can follow a different trend than large river systems in the Canadian Reference Hydrometric Basin Network database. Hydrology in smaller drainage basins is governed by the degree of urbanization and impermeable, high-runoff surfaces. In the Don River Watershed in the Lake Ontario basin, urbanization of 15 percent of in 1950 is predicted to become 91 percent in 2021.[77] Average annual flows in the Don River have increased by 0.44% per year since the early 1960s.[78]"

In their report they described how, \"In Alberta, major floods along rivers and streams have resulted in loss of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. Major recent flood events occurred in 1995, 1997 and 2005. River floods can occur throughout the year with precipitation leading to summer floods (1995 and 2005 floods) and river ice creating a potential for flooding in the winter (1997 floods). River flooding in Southern Alberta during the spring of 2005 tragically resulted in the loss of 3 lives and an economic loss of hundreds of millions of dollars.\"[87]:\u200a1\u200a> They noted that, \"All levels of government have a role to play in a provincial flood mitigation strategy for Alberta. For a large flood event, the federal government pays up to 90% of the disaster assistance funds and, therefore, should have an interest in a strategy to reduce economic losses. The province has responsibility for managing natural resources that includes regulating activities in the waterways, flood risk identification and flood forecasting. As well the province is responsible for a portion of disaster assistance funding. The municipal government is responsible for considering flood protection in land use bylaws and emergency management within their community if a flood event were to occur.\"[87]:\u200a1 One of their most important recommendations was the \"cessation of the sale of Crown lands in known flood risk areas.\" The report noted that \"Undeveloped flood plains are the natural and most effective form of flood mitigation, and this recommendation will protect those areas.\" The 2006 Provincial Flood Mitigation Report \"recommended the completion of flood risk maps for urban areas in the province; a program to ensure those maps are updated; the identification of priority rural flood risk areas that require flood risk mapping; and making historic flood information available to the public on a website.\"[88] The Highwood River at High River is \"located at a change in slope of the channel on a basin in an area of high runoff potential, resulting in frequent flooding.\"[89] The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR) \u2019s mission \"is to reduce the loss of life and property caused by severe weather and earthquakes through the identification and support of sustained actions that improve society\u2019s capacity to adapt to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.

        "content": " The 1943 Atlantic hurricane season marked the first deliberate reconnaissance aircraft flights into tropical cyclones. The season officially lasted from June\u00a016 to October\u00a031, which was, at the time, considered the most likely period for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic Ocean.[1][nb 1] A total of ten storms from 1943 are listed in the Atlantic hurricane database, and an eleventh system that affected Florida and Georgia has been identified as a probable tropical depression. The first system of the year, dubbed the \"Surprise hurricane\", caused severe damage throughout Texas and Louisiana in June, partially because information about its approach was censored in the fray of World War II; the storm caused 19 deaths and $17\u00a0million in damage.[nb 2] A major hurricane in mid-August produced hurricane-force winds in Bermuda,[nb 3] and several other tropical cyclones throughout the year resulted in strong winds there. In September, a hurricane impacted the western Gulf Coast of the United States, then a tropical storm struck the Mid-Atlantic. The two storms resulted in $419,000 and $20,000 in damage, respectively; one death was attributed to the latter system. In mid-October, a strong hurricane resulted in flooding and damage to crops throughout the Caribbean; after becoming post-tropical, it contributed to moderate impacts across Nova Scotia. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 94\u00a0units,[4] above  the 1931\u20131943 average of 91.2.[5] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[4]"

        "content": "The Surprise Hurricane of 1943 The 1943 Surprise hurricane was the first hurricane to be entered by a reconnaissance aircraft.[6] An area of low pressure was first observed over the Southeastern United States and eastern Gulf of Mexico on July\u00a023. It tracked west-northwest and, in conjunction with surface observations along the Louisiana coastline,[7] was found to have organized into a tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a025 while situated about 110\u00a0mi (175\u00a0km) southeast of the Mississippi Delta. The nascent cyclone rapidly intensified thereafter, attaining hurricane intensity by 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a026 and reaching its peak as a Category\u00a02 hurricane with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) early the following morning. The compact hurricane moved ashore the coastline of Texas near Galveston Bay at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a027,[8] around which time it was intercepted by the first reconnaissance aircraft to intentionally fly into a tropical cyclone.[7] The storm weakened once inland and dissipated about 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km/h) early of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex by 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a030.[8] In the fray of World War II, information was censored by the Federal government of the United States across the country, including reports from ships that the Weather Bureau heavily relied upon for hurricane updates. The cyclone that affected the Texas and Louisiana coastlines, therefore, was dubbed the 1943 \"Surprise\" hurricane. Documentation of the storm's impacts suggests it was the worst since the 1915 Galveston hurricane. The Houston, Texas Metropolitan Airport recorded a peak wind gust of 132\u00a0mph (212\u00a0km/h). Two utility towers over the Houston Ship Channel, built to withstand winds of roughly 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h), were toppled. Along the coastline near Texas City, storm surge values were surprisingly light at between 3\u20136\u00a0ft (0.9\u20131.8\u00a0m), but 90% of homes either suffered water damage or were completely destroyed. Rising water from Galveston Bay resulted in flooding throughout the city itself, and a three-story building was collapsed by strong winds.[6] Rainfall across Texas and Louisiana varied, but Devers, Texas, recorded a maximum storm total of 23\u00a0in (584\u00a0mm).[9] Widespread freshwater flooding occurred in the Beaumont and Port Arthur areas. At Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, scores of air cadets and soldiers held onto the wings of airplanes to prevent them from going airborne; almost two dozen were injured in the aftermath. Offshore, the hopper dredge Galveston and tugboat Titan were capsized, leading to a total of 15 deaths. Overall, damage from the hurricane reached $17 million, 19 deaths were documented, and hundreds of people were injured. As a result of the casualties, the decision to censor information during an approaching storm was never again repeated.[6]"

Passing within 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) of Bermuda, it produced winds around tropical storm-force there before it was last documented over the northwestern Atlantic early on October\u00a017.[7][8] As the cyclone entered the Caribbean Sea, it produced maximum winds of 40\u201350\u00a0mph (64\u201380\u00a0km/h) in Saint Lucia. Puerto Rico recorded winds near 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) which unroofed houses. Heavy rainfall, peaking at 17.6\u00a0in (447\u00a0mm) in Toro Negro, led to flooding in several communities. The combination of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high seas resulted in severe damage to the island's coffee crop. As the hurricane passed through the western Atlantic, Bermuda recorded a period of tropical storm-force winds.[10] The USS Lee Fox encountered the storm on its voyage and was nearly capsized.[12] As a post-tropical cyclone, the system produced winds near 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) across Nova Scotia, cut electricity to Liverpool and Annapolis Valley (where the apple crop sustained $300,000 in losses), and disrupted telephone service in Halifax. Heavy surf washed out a 200\u00a0ft (60\u00a0m) section of railway in Shelburne while some railway lines in Lockeport suffered damage. A barge was severed from a large ship in Halifax and went aground on Georges Island.[13]"

        "content": " Hurricane Lenny was the strongest November Atlantic hurricane since the 1932 Cuba hurricane. It was the twelfth tropical storm, eighth hurricane, and record-breaking fifth Category 4\u00a0hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Lenny formed on November\u00a013 in the western Caribbean Sea at around 18:00 UTC and went on to form and maintain an unusual and unprecedented easterly track for its entire duration, which gave it the common nickname, \"Wrong Way Lenny\". It attained hurricane status south of Jamaica on November 15 and passed south of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico over the next few days. Lenny rapidly intensified over the northeastern Caribbean on November\u00a017, attaining peak winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h) about 21\u00a0mi (34\u00a0km) south of Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. It gradually weakened while moving through the Leeward Islands, eventually dissipating on November\u00a023 over the open Atlantic Ocean. Before moving through the Lesser Antilles, Lenny produced rough surf that killed two people in northern Colombia. Strong winds and rainfall resulted in heavy crop damage in southeastern Puerto Rico. Despite the hurricane's passage near Saint Croix at peak intensity, damage on the small island was only described as \"moderate\", although there was widespread flooding and erosion. Damage in the United States territories totaled about $330\u00a0million. The highest precipitation total was 34.12\u00a0in (867\u00a0mm) at the police station on the French side of Saint Martin. On the island, the hurricane killed three people and destroyed more than 200\u00a0properties. In nearby Antigua and Barbuda, the hurricane killed one person; torrential rainfall there contaminated the local water supply. Significant storm damage occurred as far south as Grenada, where high surf isolated towns from the capital city."

        "content": "Hurricane Lenny began as a low-pressure area that was first observed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November\u00a08. It developed an area of convection but remained poorly defined for the next few days. Thunderstorms spread across the region, producing heavy rainfall in portions of Mexico and Central America. On November\u00a013, the system became better organized; a Hurricane Hunters flight later that day discovered a surface circulation and winds of about 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h). The data indicated the development of Tropical Depression Sixteen at 1800\u00a0UTC, about 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) south of the Cayman Islands.[1] The depression's convection was fairly disorganized, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not anticipate any strengthening for three days.[2] For much of its existence, the tropical cyclone maintained a track from west to east across the Caribbean Sea, which was unprecedented in the Atlantic hurricane database, earning it the nicknames \"Left-Hand Lenny\" and \"Wrong Way Lenny\". The path resulted from its movement along the southern end of a trough over the western Atlantic Ocean.[1] After its formation, the depression gradually became better organized;[3] the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Lenny on November\u00a014,[1] based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters. When it was first upgraded to a tropical storm, the cyclone already had winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and a developing eye feature.[4] At 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a015, Lenny attained hurricane status about 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) southwest of Kingston, Jamaica.[1] The quick intensification was unexpected and occurred after a large area of convection blossomed over the center. At the same time, Lenny developed an anticyclone aloft, which provided favorable conditions for the hurricane's development.[5] After moving east-southeastward during its initial development stages, the hurricane turned more to the east on November\u00a015. The Hurricane Hunters reported winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), which indicated that Lenny had become a Category\u00a02 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.[6] However, the cloud pattern subsequently became less organized as the eye disappeared, and Lenny's winds weakened to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) while the hurricane passed south of Hispaniola.[1] The NHC noted the deterioration could have been due to a disruption of the storm's small inner core by \"subtle environmental changes\". After the sudden weakening,[7] the Hurricane Hunters reported that the eye had reformed and the hurricane's winds had reached 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). At the time, a ridge was expected to build to Lenny's east and turn the storm northeastward into Puerto Rico 24\u00a0hours later.[8] Beginning on November\u00a016, Hurricane Lenny underwent a 24-hour period of rapid deepening, reaching major hurricane status about 165\u00a0mi (266\u00a0km) south of the Mona Passage.[1] It developed well-defined banding features, good outflow, and a circular eye that was visible from the radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[9] The hurricane continued to become better organized, with an eye 29\u00a0mi (47\u00a0km) in diameter surrounded by a closed eyewall.[10] Around 1200\u00a0UTC on November\u00a017, Lenny intensified into a Category\u00a04 hurricane while approaching the islands of the northeastern Caribbean. It was the fifth storm of such intensity in the year, setting the record for most Category\u00a04 hurricanes in a season.[1] The hurricane then made its closest approach to Puerto Rico, passing about 75\u00a0mi (121\u00a0km) southeast of Maunabo.[11] Shortly thereafter, Lenny attained peak winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h) while passing 21\u00a0mi (34\u00a0km) south of the island of Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands.[1] This made it the fourth-strongest hurricane on record to form during the month of November.[12] Hurricane Hunters reported Lenny's peak winds in the southeastern portion of the hurricane; the group also reported a minimum pressure of 933\u00a0mbar, a drop of 34\u00a0mbar in 24\u00a0hours. In addition, a dropsonde recorded winds of 210\u00a0mph (340\u00a0km/h) while descending to the surface, the highest dropsonde wind speed recording in a hurricane at the time.[1] Around the time it peaked in intensity, Lenny's forward speed decreased in response to light steering currents between two ridges. Despite favorable conditions for strengthening, the hurricane weakened as it turned to an eastward drift, possibly due to the upwelling of cooler waters. Late on November\u00a018, Lenny's eye moved over Saint Martin with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h). After continued weakening, the hurricane struck Anguilla and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy the next day. It turned southeastward while still drifting, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands across the northeastern Caribbean.[1] Late on November\u00a019, Lenny weakened to tropical storm intensity after increased wind shear exposed the cyclone's center from the deepest convection.[1][13] Early on November\u00a020, the storm made landfall on Anguilla,[1] although by then the center had become difficult to locate.[14] Later that day, the cyclone exited the Caribbean,[15] continuing its southeast track. On November\u00a021, Lenny turned to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression.[1] The deep convection was located at least 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) east of the increasingly elongated center.[16] Lenny turned to the east for the final time early on November\u00a022, dissipating on the next day about 690\u00a0mi (1,110\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles.[1]"

        "content": "Early in Lenny's existence, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were issued for Jamaica. Later, a hurricane watch was issued for the southern coast of Hispaniola, and a tropical storm warning was also issued for the Dominican Republic.[1] Haitian officials declared a state of alert in three southern provinces and allocated about $1\u00a0million (1999\u00a0USD) in hurricane funds.[17] Residents in flood-prone areas were advised to evacuate in southern Haiti and in the neighboring Dominican Republic.[18][19] A hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November\u00a015, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later.[1] By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico.[8] After Lenny made its closest approach to the island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November\u00a017, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands.[1] In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm and as a result of its impact, around 4,700\u00a0people evacuated to 191\u00a0shelters. This included 1,190\u00a0residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27\u00a0schools, as well as 584\u00a0people in western Puerto Rico.[20] Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies.[21] The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands.[22] Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency.[23] In St. Croix, 309\u00a0people rode out the storm in shelters.[11] Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands.[20] There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.[24] Governments across the eastern Caribbean issued hurricane warnings as far south as Montserrat.[1] In Anguilla, residents near the coast were advised to evacuate. Schools closed ahead of the storm, and the ferry between the island and Saint Martin was halted and moved to a safe location. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the National Emergency Management Agency was activated on November\u00a016. Officials there advised residents living near ghauts to evacuate, and one shelter was located in each district of the country. In addition, stores were open for longer hours to allow people to stock up on supplies.[25] Most businesses and schools were closed in Antigua and Barbuda during the storm, while in Dominica, the airport was closed.[26] Further south, there was little warning for the hurricane in Grenada, and most people left their boats in the water.[27]"

        "content": "Early in its existence, Lenny produced large waves and high tides along the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia,[1] sinking two boats and flooding 1,200\u00a0houses. There were also reports of flooded businesses and damaged crops. In the country, strong winds on the storm's fringe killed a man by striking him with a beam. Although there were initial reports of nine people missing,[17] only two were counted in the death toll for mainland Colombia.[1] Two sailors were killed offshore when their yacht was lost in the southern Caribbean Sea.[1] Along the ABC Islands off the north coast of Venezuela, the hurricane produced 10-to-20\u00a0ft (3-to-6\u00a0m) waves along the southwest coastlines.[30] The waves caused heavy beach erosion and coastal damage to properties and boats.[31] In Jamaica, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall but left little damage. Rains in the Dominican Republic caused flooding in the country's southwest portion.[19] Flooding around Les Cayes in southwestern Haiti destroyed 60\u00a0percent of the rice, corn, and banana plantations, while high waves wrecked several houses in Cavaellon.[21] Hurricane Lenny was originally forecast to strike Puerto Rico, although it remained south of the island.[1] Beginning on November\u00a017, Lenny affected Puerto Rico with gusty winds and heavy rainfall. Rainfall in the days prior to Lenny's approach left areas susceptible to flooding, which caused many rivers in the northeastern portion of the island to overflow their banks following the storm. Such flooding forced towns to evacuate along the rivers, and also resulted in the closure of secondary and primary highways. The heavy rains also caused mudslides and rockslides.[11] The peak rainfall on the island was 14.64\u00a0in (372\u00a0mm) in Jayuya in central Puerto Rico.[32] Tides in San Juan were about 1.8\u00a0ft (0.55\u00a0m) above normal. There, high seas washed a 546\u00a0ft (166\u00a0m) freighter ashore. Winds in the Puerto Rican mainland were not significant, gusting to 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) in Ceiba. The storm left 22,000\u00a0people without power and 103,000\u00a0people without water.[11] Because of the heavy rainfall, about 200\u00a0farmers in southeastern Puerto Rico sustained about $19\u00a0million in crop damage (1999\u00a0USD). In the affected region, the heavy rainfall destroyed 80\u00a0percent of the vegetables and 50\u00a0percent of the plantains. Damage throughout the island totaled $105\u00a0million (1999\u00a0USD).[33]"

        "content": "After passing southeast of Puerto Rico, Hurricane Lenny struck St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, although its strongest winds remained southeast of the island. There, gusts reached 112\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), while sustained winds officially peaked around 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). Strong winds damaged the roofs of many houses in eastern St. Croix[1] and knocked down trees and power lines. The winds left severe damage to vegetation after fruits and vegetables were blown away. Rainfall peaked at 10.47\u00a0in (266\u00a0mm),[32] which caused widespread flooding of many properties in the island's western portion. In Frederiksted, the hurricane produced a storm surge of 15\u201320\u00a0ft (4.6\u20136.1\u00a0m)[1] along with high waves that washed out roads and damaged coastal structures. There was also severe beach erosion in western St. Croix; high waves dumped 6.5\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) of sand onto coastal roads about 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) inland,[11] and also washed several boats ashore.[1] The National Weather Service described the damage as \"moderate\".[11] Elsewhere in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Lenny produced a storm surge of about 1.8\u00a0ft (0.55\u00a0m) in St. Thomas.[1] Sustained winds on the island reached 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) at the Cyril E. King Airport, with gusts to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). On nearby St. John, wind gusts reached 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h),[11] and sustained hurricane-force winds of 83\u00a0mph (134\u00a0km/h) were reported on Maria Hill.[1] Rains were not as heavy as on St. Croix; the maximum amounts were 4.34\u00a0in (110\u00a0mm) on St. Thomas and 2.95\u00a0in (75\u00a0mm) on St. John. Both islands reported beach erosion along their southern coastlines.[11] Damage on St. Thomas was minimal, limited to minor flooding and mudslides. The Virgin Islands National Park in St. John reported over $1.6\u00a0million in damage (1999\u00a0USD).[33] In Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the hurricane left about $330\u00a0million in damage (1999\u00a0USD), but caused no deaths.[1] In Virgin Gorda in the nearby British Virgin Islands, the hurricane produced sustained winds of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). Rainfall amounted to around 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm)[1] and caused a mudslide near Coxheath. High waves eroded a portion of Sir Francis Drake Highway, and the high winds destroyed the roof of an apartment.[20] Property damage in the British Virgin Islands totaled $5.6\u00a0million (1999\u00a0USD); however, the damage combined with the loss of tourism and productivity yielded a loss of $22\u00a0million to the islands' economy, or 3.1\u00a0percent of the gross domestic product.[34]"

There were five deaths, especially from drowning and electrocution in Guadeloupe and damage in the island totaled at least $100\u00a0million.[1] Although there were no tropical-storm sustained wind recorded as the storm didn't really impacted the islands unlike previous hurricanes such as Luis, Marilyn and Georges, the extent of damage was globally heavier due to the unusual high waves in the western portion of the island and the very slow-moving storm that generated unrelated flooding inland in Grande-Terre for a 48 hour-period."

The erosion heavily impacted tourist areas and also threatened the foundation of the runway at the Maurice Bishop International Airport. Storm damage cut off the towns in western Grenada from the capital city of Saint George's. The cut-off roads resulted in an island-wide fuel shortage.[29] In Saint John Parish, the storm knocked out the water and power supply and forced several families to evacuate their damaged houses.[62] The small island Carriacou, located north of Grenada, sustained damage to the road to its primary airport.[29] At least 10\u00a0homes were destroyed in the country,[1] and damage totaled $94.6\u00a0million; this represented 27\u00a0percent of the island's gross domestic product.[29] Effects from the storm reached as far south as Trinidad and Tobago.[29] In the country, storm surge caused damage to boats and coastal structures, while beach erosion was reported in Tobago.[63]"

Similarly on Saint Croix, power systems were quickly restored.[65] On November\u00a023, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area. This allocated federal funding for loans to public and private entities and provided 75\u00a0percent of the cost of debris removal.[66] By December\u00a010, nearly 3,000\u00a0residents had applied for assistance, mostly on St. Croix. In response, the federal government provided about $480,000 to the affected people.[67] The United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided $185,000, mostly directed toward the United Nations Development Programme, for aid to other islands in the eastern Caribbean. Other agencies, including the Caribbean Development Bank, the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, and the European Union, provided $1.1\u00a0million in assistance.[29] In response to the damage on Saint Martin, officials in the Netherlands Antilles issued an appeal to the European Parliament for assistance from the international community.[48] Due to their small population and area, the small islands of the eastern Caribbean required international funding to repair the damage from the hurricane and return to normal. In Antigua and Barbuda, officials worked quickly to repair roads and clean Barbuda's water system.[29] However, 20,000\u00a0people in Antigua remained without water for a week after the hurricane, and the stagnant water caused an increase in mosquitoes.[50] The government of Dominica provided 42\u00a0families with temporary shelters. With a loan from the Caribbean Development Bank, the government worked to complete a sea wall along a highway south of its capital Roseau. The Saint Lucian government provided housing to 70\u00a0families. In Grenada, workers repaired the road system to allow fuel transportation across the island and began to reclaim land near its airport to mitigate erosion.[29] Regions in Antigua and Grenada were declared disaster areas.[52][68] Across the eastern Caribbean, local Red Cross offices provided food and shelter to affected citizens.[62] High damage to tourist areas caused a short term suspension of cruise ship arrivals.

        "content": "The 2015\u201316 South Pacific cyclone season was one of the most disastrous South Pacific tropical cyclone seasons on record, with a total of 50 deaths and $1.405\u00a0billion (2016 USD) in damage. Throughout the season, 8 systems attained tropical cyclone status, whilst 5 became severe tropical cyclones. The most notable cyclone of the season by far was Winston, which attained a minimum pressure of  884\u00a0hPa (mbar; 26.10\u00a0inHg), and maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h), making it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Southern Hemisphere. Winston went on to devastate Fiji, causing $1.4\u00a0billion (2016 USD) in damage and 44 deaths across the country. The 2015\u201316 season marked the period of the year when most tropical cyclones form within the South Pacific Ocean to the east of 160\u00b0E. The season officially ran from November 1, 2015, to April 30, 2016, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016, and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones are officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service and the Meteorological Service of New Zealand (MetService). Other warning centres like the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) will also monitor the basin. The FMS and MetService both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale and estimate wind speeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS)."

        "content": "After the occurrences of Tropical Cyclone Raquel and Tropical Depression 01F during July and August 2015, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) noted that the ongoing 2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event, might mean that more tropical cyclones occur in the basin than usual during the season.[6][7] It was also noted that during previous El Ni\u00f1o episodes the season started early, with systems developing before the start of the season on November 1.[6][7] As a result, the FMS expected the tropical cyclone season to start during October 2015.[6][7] During September 24, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France announced that there was a 90% chance of either a moderate tropical storm, severe tropical storm or tropical cyclone, impacting the waters surrounding French Polynesia during the season.[8] Ahead of the cyclone season, the FMS, the BoM, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, New Zealand's MetService and National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and various other Pacific Meteorological services, all contributed towards the Island Climate Update tropical cyclone outlook that was released during October 2015.[4] The outlook took into account the strong El Ni\u00f1o conditions that had been observed across the Pacific and analogue seasons that had ENSO neutral and weak El Ni\u00f1o conditions occurring during the season.[4] The outlook called for an above average number of tropical cyclones for the 2015\u201316 season, with eleven to thirteen named tropical cyclones to occur between 135\u00b0E and 120\u00b0W compared to an average of 10\u201312.[4] At least six of the tropical cyclones were expected to become category 3 severe tropical cyclones, while four could become category 4 severe tropical cyclones. It was also noted that Category 5 severe tropical cyclones, with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 196\u00a0km/h (122\u00a0mph) were known to occur during El Ni\u00f1o events.[4] In addition to contributing towards the Island Climate Update outlook the BoM and the FMS, issued their own seasonal forecasts for the South Pacific region.[3][5] The BoM issued a seasonal forecast for both the Western and Eastern South Pacific.[5] The Western region between 142.5\u00b0E and 165\u00b0E was predicted to have a 15% chance of having an above average number of tropical cyclones, while the Eastern region between 165\u00b0E and 120\u00b0W was predicted to have a 48% chance of having an above average number of tropical cyclones.[5] Within their outlook the FMS predicted that between ten and fourteen tropical cyclones, would occur within the basin compared to an average of around 7.3\u00a0cyclones.[3] Between four and eight of these tropical cyclones were expected to intensify into category 3 severe tropical cyclones, while 3-7 might intensify into Category 4 or 5 severe tropical cyclones.[3] They also reported that the tropical cyclone genesis trough was expected to be displaced far eastwards of its long term average position.[3] This was based on the expected and predicted ENSO conditions, and the existence of the Pacific warm pool of sub-surface temperature anomalies in this region.[3] Both the Island Climate Update and the FMS tropical cyclone outlooks assessed the risk of a tropical cyclone affecting a certain island or territory.[3][4] As the tropical cyclone genesis trough of low pressure was expected to be located near to and to the east of the International Date Line, normal or slightly above normal activity was expected for areas near the dateline.[3][4] With the exception of Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Niue, and Tonga, the Island Climate Update predicted that all areas would experience an elevated risk of being affected by multiple tropical cyclones.[4] The FMS's outlook predicted that the Solomon and Northern Cook Islands, Wallis and Futuna, Tokelau, Samoa, and French Polynesia had a highly elevated chance of being affected by a tropical cyclone.[3] Vanuatu, Fiji, Niue, and the Southern Cook Islands had an elevated risk, while a normal risk was anticipated for New Caledonia, Tuvalu, and Tonga.[3]"

        "content": "As the 2015\u201316 tropical cyclone year opened, Tropical Cyclone Raquel was active within the Australian region and affecting the Solomon Islands with heavy rain and high winds. The system subsequently moved into the basin as a weakening tropical depression during July 2, before it was last noted within the Australian region during July 5; it is considered a storm from the previous season, not of this season. Later that month RSMC Nadi started to monitor Tropical Disturbance 01F, which had developed to the north-northeast of Honiara in the Solomon Islands. Over the next few days the system slowly organised further, before it was classified as Tropical Cyclone 01P by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, on August 2. In mid-October, Tropical Depression 02F formed. Despite being in a favorable environment, the weak storm dissipated on October 18. In late November, two systems formed in succession: Tropical Depressions 03F and 04F. 03F later strengthened into Tropical Cyclone Tuni. Both dissipated on December 2.[citation needed] Later that month, the basin became more active, with Tropical Depressions 05F, 06F, and 07F forming just days apart. 05F later strengthened into Tropical Cyclone Ula, while 07F caused fatalities in the Solomon Islands. Ula subsequently weakened, but later rapidly re-intensified into a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone, reaching its peak intensity. Meanwhile, 06F developed to the north of Wallis Island, but was absorbed by Ula. Victor ended the first slew of storms, dissipating on January 24. Following this, the basin was dormant for three weeks; however, a slew of storms began forming in February. Winston led off the month, forming on February 7. Similar to Ula, the storm attained a preliminary peak, weakened, but later rapidly re-intensified into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, making landfall near Suva, Fiji, at peak strength. This made Winston the strongest tropical cyclone on record to impact Fiji. Winston then moved southwest, out of the basin, on February 26, dissipating on March 1. Cyclone Tatiana briefly moved into the basin on February 12, but dissipated the next day, as it exited the basin. Yalo and a tropical depression followed to this: Yalo dissipated on February 26, while 12F dissipated on March 1. The basin became dormant again as the season wound down. Despite this, Tropical Depression 13F formed on March 19, and dissipated three days later. The basin once again became dormant again, as the end of March neared, until another tropical depression formed in early April. One of the three depressions became Cyclone Zena, which caused more problems to the nearly decimated Fiji. Amos formed in late April and moved over Samoa and American Samoa.[citation needed] During the season, most of the island nations in the basin were impacted by systems impacting land. In particular, Raquel, Tropical Depressions 01F, 02F and 07F affected the Solomon Islands. The Samoan Islands were impacted by Tuni, Ula, Victor and Amos. Ula, Winston and Zena impacted Fiji. Individually, Ula affected Tuvalu and New Caledonia, while Winston also affected Tonga, and Vanuatu, and after leaving the basin, Niue, and eventually Queensland. Yalo affected French Polynesia in late February.[citation needed]"

        "content": "The 2011 flooding on the Musselshell River in Montana began about May 21, affecting large parts of central Montana.[1][2] At Mosby, Montana, the river crested at 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m) on Monday, May 23. The flood level at Mosby is 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) and the record crest at that point along the Musselshell is 17.7 feet (5.4\u00a0m), set in 1993.[3] The flooding was caused by up to 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rain combined with snowmelt.[2] On May 24 at Shawmut, near Harlowton, a record pace was set, with a flow rate of 3,670 cubic feet per second (104\u00a0m3/s). The average flow is 183\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (5.2\u00a0m3/s) at that spot for May 24. The prior record at Shawmut was set in 2005 with a rate of 802\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (22.7\u00a0m3/s). Several roads in the Musselshell watershed were already closed by this date.[1] The town of Roundup suffered the most damage of any community along the Musselshell. Potable water, food, and medicine were major concerns.[4] Flood waters along the Musselshell near Roundup were as much as 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) deep,[2] cresting over the weekend.[5] Flooding near Roundup was at least 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) above record flood level and forced the evacuation of dozens of homes. On Thursday, May 26 the flooding inundated portions of  Roundup,[5] At Highway 87 the floodwaters were flowing at over 3,670\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (104\u00a0m3/s), more than 10 times the normal rate. On May 26 the Musselshell crested near Roundup at 14.16 feet (4.32\u00a0m). Its flood stage there is 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m). The previous record for that location was set in 1975 at 12.89 feet (3.93\u00a0m).[6] In Petroleum County alone damage costs were estimated at US$1.5 million.[4] By June 23, the Musselshell had receded back below its banks, FEMA had assessed damage to public lands and was back in Roundup to assess damage to private lands and properties.[7] Flooding on the unconnected Yellowstone River to the south prompted the closing of  a 20 miles (32\u00a0km) portion of Interstate 90 from Livingston to Springdale.[5] Floodwaters from the tributary Pryor creek led to closing of Pompeys Pillar National Monument.[5] The Little Bighorn River and related tributaries flooded the area around Crow Agency and shut down Interstate 90 from Hardin to the Wyoming line for several days.[8] Montana counties that were affected by the state-wide flooding in Spring 2011 include: Big Horn, Carbon, Garfield, Granite, Jefferson, Judith Basin, Missoula, Musselshell, Petroleum, Sanders, Wheatland, and Yellowstone. A state of emergency was declared in 51 Montana counties, cities, and Indian reservations.[2] Flood waters from the Musselshell, Yellowstone, and several other Montana rivers flow into the Missouri River and Mississippi River, exacerbating the 2011 flooding in states such as North Dakota and South Dakota.[2]"

        "content": "Hurricane Kyle was a Category 1 hurricane that caused heavy rain and flooding in Puerto Rico in its formative stage and brought hurricane-force winds to Nova Scotia while extratropical. The eleventh tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Kyle formed from a strong tropical disturbance that tracked across the northeastern Caribbean Sea in the third week of September. As a low pressure area, it moved slowly across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, dumping torrential rains across those islands. By September\u00a024, it began to track northward away from the islands, and developed enough strong thunderstorm activity near its center and a well-defined enough circulation to be deemed a tropical storm on September\u00a025. It strengthened to a hurricane on September\u00a027 west of Bermuda. It made landfall in Nova Scotia as a Category 1 hurricane late on September 28, then became extratropical shortly afterward. The precursor to Kyle produced torrential rainfall over Puerto Rico, resulting in six fatalities and $48\u00a0million in damages. Little impact was recorded in Hispaniola and Bermuda as the system tracked northward. Along the eastern United States, rough seas resulted in two fatalities and as the storm made landfall in Canada, heavy rains fell in eastern Maine. In Canada, Kyle had relatively little impact, leaving $9\u00a0million in damages and no fatalities."

        "content": "Hurricane Kyle began as a weak area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September\u00a012.[1] The system tracked in a general westward direction with little convective development and tracked over the Leeward Islands on September\u00a018.[2] An upper-level trough situated over the eastern Caribbean Sea interacted with the wave, resulting in an increase in shower and thunderstorm activity. The following day, a larger surface circulation developed as the low moved towards the northwest. The wave later became separated from the low, with the wave continuing towards the west and the low tracking to the northwest.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC), at this time, were not anticipating significant development of the low as strong wind shear inhibited deep convection from forming.[3] Around 1400\u00a0UTC on September\u00a021, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the system as convection developed around the center of circulation.[4] Around 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a025, the disturbance was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression.[1] Shortly after, the NHC issued their first advisory on the system as it intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Kyle. The center of the storm was slightly elongated but moderate wind shear continued to impact the circulation. Kyle track northward in response to an area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States.[5] The sheared structure of the storm led to problems with recording the intensity of the storm throughout the day. Hurricane Hunters continuously flew into the storm to record information; however, their estimates were considered too high as the storm was disorganized.[6] Late on September\u00a026, shear began to relax and deep convection redeveloped around the center of circulation and the forward motion of the storm began to increase.[7] Several hours later, the storm made a sudden northwest jump due to a passing shortwave trough.[8] By this time, Kyle was just below hurricane-status, with sustained winds up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). Continued organization led to the storm attaining hurricane intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a027 while located about 345\u00a0mi (555\u00a0km) west of Bermuda.[1] Upon attaining this intensity, the storm became embedded within an area strong, divergent, upper-level winds.[9] Increasing in forward motion, the center of Kyle was located along the southwestern edge of the deep convection.[10] By September\u00a028, the storm began to struggle maintaining its intensity due to increasing shear and cooling sea surface temperatures;[11] around 1200\u00a0UTC that day, the NHC assessed Kyle to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0mph). Several hours later, the barometric pressure of the storm decreased to 984\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.06\u00a0inHg), the lowest during its existence.[1] Around this time, the hurricane began to undergo an extratropical transition as it approached Nova Scotia.[12] By the end of September\u00a028, little deep convection remained around the center of Kyle. Buoys nearby the storm recorded seas in excess of 36\u00a0ft (11\u00a0m) and hurricane-force winds as it neared landfall.[13] It was estimated that Kyle made landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia around 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029 with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[1] This marked the first time since Hurricane Juan in 2003 that a hurricane made landfall in Canada, exactly five years, to the day, prior.[14] Shortly after landfall, the storm weakened below hurricane-status and completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone.[1] Throughout September\u00a029, the remnants slowed and the system attained frontal features. The following day the system moved over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence before being absorbed by another large extratropical cyclone.[1]"

The Red Cross in New Brunswick also were checking equipment and supplies to meet any need that might arise.[22] Hours before landfall, a hurricane warning was issued for portions of Nova Scotia.

The floods were attributed to excess torrential rain caused by La Ni\u00f1a and a negative Indian Ocean Dipole.[8] In Victoria, the Campaspe River, Maribyrnong River, Avoca River, Goulburn River, Loddon River[9] and Broken River all flooded their banks.[10] In New South Wales, the Lachlan River caused major flooding in Forbes and the Murrumbidgee River at Wagga Wagga caused problems. In Tasmania, the Mersey River, Meander River and Macquarie River saw water levels reach major flood levels.[10] With the exception of the Maribyrnong River, the aforementioned Victoria and NSW rivers flow into the Murray River, which caused flooding downstream in North-Western Victoria and South Australia in November and December, and into January.[11] The floods were expected to reduce Australia's economic growth and increase inflation.[12] According to the Insurance Council of Australia, the NSW floods were the nation's costliest natural disaster on record, with over $5.5 billion in claims.[13]"

Echuca residents face two threats, first floodwaters from the Campaspe River and then from the Murray River.[23] A 2.5-kilometre dirt levee was built at Echuca to keep the Murray River out of homes and businesses.[24]  In the Victorian council areas of Campaspe, Greater Shepparton, Maribyrnong, Mitchell and Strathbogie, the federal government made a one-off, non-means tested disaster recovery payment of $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child available.[22]  Across the states suffering in the crisis, 23 local government areas were made eligible.[19]  Displaced people were able to seek shelter at the former quarantine facility in Mickleham.[19]"

The extreme nature of the weather gave people little time to flee buildings or vehicles; mud rapidly swept down from the surrounding hills and cliffs, clogging the streets of these towns with debris and grime, and carrying away people, cars, and dwellings.[4] Officials reported that 230\u00a0mm (9 inches) of rain fell in the space of three hours.[5] In some areas, the mud was 20\u00a0m (66 feet) deep. The slide hit so quickly that rescuers later found many people trapped in cars and dwellings. Rail lines were covered with mud and major roads into the area were blocked. One man was found dead in his automobile, which was submerged in mud and water.[6][7][8] Another drowned in the flooded cellar of his country home.[5][9] A man choked to death after taking in mud in when the main piazza was flooded in a suburb of the city of Messina.[9] A survivor recounted his escape: \"I was driving home when suddenly all this stuff came down on top of me and hit me full on. I managed to climb out of the car. It was a terrible experience\".[8] Cars were swept along by the mud.[4] Many buildings collapsed; some were partially submerged by mud, and engulfed by water and debris.[5] Some people were washed away into the Ionian Sea.[10][11] At least 100 people evacuated their houses following mudslides.[6] As of 8 October, seven people were still missing,[1] and at least 450 inhabitants of the comuni were left homeless by the extreme weather.[12] 40 wounded people were hospitalised; at least two of these were said to have serious injuries.[6][12][13] Messina has been surrounded by mud and standing rainwater.[7] Parts of Sicily were inaccessible for days.[14] The Italian government declared a state of emergency to mobilize emergency rescue and recovery forces.[7][9][13][14][15] It was the worst landslide disaster in Italy since 1998 during which 137 people died in Sarno, near Naples.[5][14][16] The death toll was expected to rise.[14] The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said that it could be as high as fifty.[17]"

These had caused property damage but no casualties.[18][20] President Giorgio Napolitano said: \"We need a serious investment plan to increase safety \u2013 rather than grandiose public works \u2013 in this part of the country, or else tragedies like this one will happen again\".[21]"

On August 25, Surface observations indicated that a broad low pressure area developed along the deteriorating frontal boundary. Convection remained sporadic and disorganized, until thunderstorm activity began to increase and the system developed banding structure on August 26. At 1200\u00a0UTC on August 27, the low organized, and was designated as Tropical Depression Seven while located about 130\u00a0mi (210\u00a0km) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.[1] Because steering currents were initially weak, the depression was nearly stationary in movement, although forecasts predicted a ridge to the northeast of the system would gradually steer it to the west. The cyclone was situated over warm ocean waters and contained good anticyclonic flow, leading forecast models to predict at least moderate intensification.[2] Later that same day, it gradually drifted southwest and convective banding continued to increase. At 1100\u00a0UTC on August 28, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston.[1] An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters aircraft completed a flight into Gaston, revealing that the intensity was higher than previously reported. At the time, it was believed that Gaston had reached peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), placing it very close to hurricane status.[3] However, during post-season analysis, it was discovered that Gaston had briefly attained Category\u00a01 Hurricane intensity at 1800 UTC on August 28.[1] At 1400 UTC on August 29, Gaston made landfall at Awendaw, South Carolina, between Charleston and McClellanville, as a Category\u00a01 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h).[1] The storm quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it continued northward through South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, and it began to gradually move north-northeastward.[4] At 0000 UTC on August 30, the storm weakened to a tropical depression over northeastern South Carolina. As it accelerated to the northeast, it emerged in the open waters of the Chesapeake Bay and regained tropical storm status late on August 30.[5] Initially, the system maintained a good radar signature, although satellite imagery soon indicated that convection became limited in intensity and coverage. Also, a front-like band appeared to be forming southeast of the center, which indicated signs of weakening.[6] At 0600 UTC on August 31, Gaston crossed the Delmarva Peninsula for the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.[1] The system began to lose tropical characteristics as it became associated with the frontal system, although there was still some thunderstorm activity wrapped around the center.[7] Forward speed increased to about 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h),[1] and over 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C) water[8] the storm lost all of its tropical characteristics early on September 1, and became an extratropical cyclone south of Nova Scotia.[1] The extratropical remnants of Gaston were absorbed by a larger extratropical system on September 3, about 750\u00a0mi (1,210\u00a0km) south-southeast of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland.[1]"

While some managed to reopen, some closed for longer periods of time or even permanently. After the storm, city officials cordoned off the historic Shockoe Bottom area (roughly between 15th and 18th Streets, south of East Broad Street), so building inspectors and crews from the Department of Public Utilities and Dominion Virginia Power could ensure that the area's stores, restaurants, warehouses, and apartments were safe to enter and that there were no gas leaks. \"Property insurance by itself probably won't cover damages,\" said a spokesman for the State Corporation Commission. \"However, many businesses in the Bottom have flood insurance, since most lenders would make it a requirement in flood-prone areas...\" \"The best other businesses can hope for, in the rebuilding process, is federal assistance through grant money and low-interest loans if Richmond is declared a federal disaster area,\" he later said. The flooding from Gaston also affected VDOT's emergency road repair fund. VDOT estimated that repairing the wrecked roads and bridges would cost $10 to $20\u00a0million, and that did not cover damage to streets and roads that the city of Richmond and Henrico County maintain. Already stretching its budget thin, VDOT had to set $16\u00a0million aside for major projects other than snow removal, leaving very little to pay for storm damage."

        "content": "After the storm, the Richmond city government poured money into reconstruction and expansion of the drainage system and new emergency-notification technology that officials said would make Richmond ready for future storms. Beginning in 2006, the city had spent $1.9\u00a0million on projects to mitigate the impact of major rainfalls. The city had also stepped up the frequency of its inspections and cleanings of the existing drain system, and has installed a new flash flood warning system. $8.7\u00a0million was spent to help the victims of the storm, much of it from FEMA. In Shockoe Bottom, most of the buildings were rebuilt and most of the businesses were back up and running. Some business owners say that the relief came too late. This sparked criticism of the city government in response to Hurricane Gaston. Many complained about potholes lining the roads, brick sidewalks that were a mess, and faded crosswalks. Also, because of poor drainage, streets was covered with a thick layer of silt and because of the lack of trash cans, storm debris was everywhere. Even a year later, some of the damage from Gaston still lingered."

        "content": " The 1970 Atlantic hurricane season  officially began on June\u00a01 and lasted until November\u00a030. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season was fairly average, with\u00a014 named storms forming, of which seven were hurricanes. Two of those seven became major hurricanes, which are Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Also, this was the first season in which reconnaissance aircraft flew into all four quadrants of a tropical cyclone.[1] The first system, Hurricane Alma, developed on May\u00a017. The storm killed eight people, seven from flooding in Cuba and one from a lightning strike in Florida. In July, Tropical Storm Becky brought minor flooding to Florida and other parts of the Southern United States, leaving one death and about $500,000 (1970\u00a0USD) in damage. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Celia, a Category\u00a04 hurricane that slammed South Texas in early August. Celia resulted in about $930\u00a0million in damage and was the costliest hurricane in Texas until Alicia in 1983. There were 28\u00a0fatalities, with four in Cuba, eight in Florida, and sixteen in Texas. Later that month, Tropical Storm Dorothy caused severe flooding in Martinique, which left up to 51\u00a0deaths and $34\u00a0million in damage. One death occurred in Mexico as a result of Hurricane Ella after a house collapsed. In October, Tropical Depression Fifteen brought a devastating flood to Puerto Rico. At least 22\u00a0fatalities and $65.5\u00a0million in damage occurred. Collectively, the storms of this season left at least $1.03\u00a0billion in damage and 115\u00a0deaths."

        "content": "The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June\u00a01,[2] though activity began slightly earlier with Hurricane Alma forming on May\u00a017.[3] Although 21\u00a0tropical depressions developed, only fourteen of them reached tropical storm intensity.[3] However, this was well-above the 1950\u20132000\u00a0average of 9.6\u00a0named storms per season.[4] Seven of these reached hurricane status,[3] slightly above the 1950\u20132000\u00a0average of 5.9.[4] Furthermore, two storms reached major hurricane status,[3] near the average 1950\u20132000\u00a0average of 2.3.[4] Collectively, the cyclones of this season caused at least 115\u00a0deaths and over $1.03\u00a0billion in damage.[5] The Atlantic hurricane season officially ended on November\u00a030,[2] though the final tropical cyclone became extratropical on December\u00a01.[3] Tropical cyclogenesis began in May, with Alma developing on May\u00a017. No tropical cyclone activity occurred in June. Three systems originated in July, including Tropical Storm Becky and the depression that would eventually intensify into Hurricane Celia, as well as another tropical depression that remained below tropical storm intensity. Celia became the most intense tropical cyclone of the season on August\u00a03, peaking as a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 944\u00a0mbar (27.88\u00a0inHg).[3] In August, four tropical systems developed, including two tropical depressions, an unnamed hurricane, and Dorothy. September eight featured tropical depressions, though only three became named storms \u2013 Ella, Felice, and Greta.[6] October featured two unnamed hurricanes. Two more systems, a tropical depression and an unnamed tropical storm, developed in November, the latter of which transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on December\u00a01, ending the season's activity.[3] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of\u00a067. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.[7]"

        "content": "An area of disturbed weather persisted over the southwestern Caribbean in the middle of May. It gradually organized,[1] and a tropical depression formed on May\u00a017.[3] In response to low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures,[1] the depression rapidly strengthened to a tropical storm early on May\u00a020 and to a hurricane that night. However, increasing upper-level wind shear caused Alma to deteriorate back into a tropical depression on May 22.[1][3] The depression continued its general northward movement, with a brief jog to the west, and struck Cuba on May\u00a024 with maximum winds of 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h).[3] As Alma crossed the eastern Gulf of Mexico, it retained a well-defined circulation with an eye feature evident on weather radar, but the persistent shear limited the system's intensity.[1] Tropical Depression Alma made landfall near Cedar Key, Florida, on May\u00a025 and became extratropical two\u00a0days later over North Carolina.[3] Although Alma passed just offshore, impact in Central America, if any, is unknown.[1] In the Cayman Islands, winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) were reported.[8] Impact was most severe in Cuba, where flash flooding caused seven fatalities,[1][9] destroyed several homes, forced the evacuation of 3,000\u00a0people in Oriente Province, and forced 16\u00a0sugar mills to suspend operations.[9] The storm brought light rainfall to Florida, though precipitation peaked at 6.66\u00a0in (169\u00a0mm) near Miami.[10] Thunderstorms caused one death in Miami and damaged some buildings in Fort Myers.[11][12] In other states, impact came mostly in the form of rain, though a tornado near Columbia, South Carolina, unroofed one building.[13]"

        "content": "A large disturbance began to detach from the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Panama on July 16.[1] By July 19, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression. After tracking through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel, the depression became Tropical Storm Becky on July 20. Becky tracked northward to north-northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and eventually strengthened to reach peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) late on July 20.[3] Thereafter, upper-level winds began weakening the storm.[1] By July 22, Becky made landfall near Port St. Joe, Florida, as a tropical depression. The storm weakened further over land, eventually dissipating over western Kentucky on the July 23.[3] Throughout Florida, Becky produced mostly light rainfall and gale-force winds. However, in Tallahassee, the storm dropped more than 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of rain, which caused flooding in and around the city.[1] According to the Red Cross, 104\u00a0families in the Tallahassee region suffered flood-related losses. Additionally, two injuries were reported.[14] Some houses near Tallahassee were flooded with 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water, resulting in the evacuation of 15\u00a0households by rowboat. More than 100\u00a0cars in the area were also submerged.[15] In nearby Wakulla County, knee-deep waters were reported at the county courthouse in Crawfordville.[14] A tornado spawned near Panacea, destroyed a house and damaged two others. Light to moderate rain fell in neighboring states, and a tornado in Georgia caused one fatality and destroyed two homes.[1]"

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July\u00a023. It moved rapidly westward and reached the western Caribbean Sea by July\u00a030.[1] On the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression near Grand Cayman. The depression tracked north-northwestward and intensified into a tropical storm just prior to crossing far western Cuba on August\u00a01.[3] Due to warm sea surface temperatures,[1] Celia soon intensified into a hurricane late on August\u00a01 over the Gulf of Mexico. However, the storm failed to strengthen beyond Category\u00a01 status until reaching the northwest Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a03. Celia then underwent rapid intensification and at 21:00\u00a0UTC, the storm peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 944\u00a0mbar (27.88\u00a0inHg) as it made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas. Celia weakened while moving inland and dissipated over New Mexico late on August\u00a05.[3] In Cuba, heavy rains on the island caused severe flooding, leading to five fatalities.[1] Storm surge and swells lashed the west coast of Florida, especially the Panhandle. Several life guard rescues occurred, while eight people drowned.[16] In Louisiana, abnormally tides caused minor coastal flooding.[17] The strongest sustained wind speeds in Texas were around 120\u2013130\u00a0mph (190\u2013210\u00a0km/h), while winds gusts were estimated to have reached as high as 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) in Nueces County.[16] Much of the damage was caused by a series of microbursts and downbursts, most of which occurred in a 15-minute span.[18] Severe damage was reported in Nueces County, with 85% of Celia's total property losses caused in Corpus Christi alone. Approximately 90% of downtown buildings were damaged or destroyed, while about one-third of homes in the city suffered severe impact or were demolished.[16] Throughout the state, 8,950\u00a0homes were destroyed and about 55,650\u00a0others were damaged. About 252\u00a0small businesses, 331\u00a0boats, and 310\u00a0farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed.[19] In Texas, Celia caused 15\u00a0deaths and $930\u00a0million in damage.[20]"

A day later, the depression passed south of Cabo Verde as it moved across the tropical Atlantic. On August\u00a010, it intensified into a tropical storm, after the thunderstorms became more concentrated. However, a Hurricane Hunters flight two days later observed a weak system, suggesting the storm weakened back to a tropical depression. While approaching the Lesser Antilles, the depression turned to the northwest and re-intensified back into a tropical storm, with hurricane-force wind gusts north of the center. Late on August\u00a014, the circulation opened into a trough. On August\u00a015, a circulation reformed, and the system became a tropical depression again as it bypassed the eastern Bahamas. A day later, the system re-intensified into a compact tropical storm while turning northward. On August\u00a017, the storm made landfalls along the Outer Banks of North Carolina, first on Atlantic Beach and later at Rodanthe. As the storm accelerated northeastward, it intensified into a hurricane, with peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), based on the well-defined eye and a report from a nearby ship. On August\u00a018, the system became extratropical south of Newfoundland, and subsequently it slowed and shifted its track back to the south, only to resume an easterly track on August\u00a021. Late on August\u00a024, the former hurricane dissipated north of the Azores.[21] Along the coast of North Carolina, higher than normal tides capsized about 20\u00a0boats, including a 68\u00a0ft (21\u00a0m) yacht.[16] At Salvo, where the tide may have reached 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above normal, boardwalks and camping equipment were damaged at the campgrounds. Heavy squalls produced winds as strong as 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) in Atlantic Beach.[22] Minor wind damage was reported in Atlantic Beach and Morehead City, primarily limited to some trees, power lines, roof shingles, television antennas, and signs.[22][23] From North Carolina to Maryland, lifeguards made dozens of rescues.[24] Four drowning deaths occurred, with two in North Carolina and two in Virginia.[23][24][25]"

As it moved west-northwestward, it slowly intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dorothy several hours later. Around 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, Dorothy attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), several hours before striking Martinique.[3] After passing through the Lesser Antilles, Dorothy moved under an upper-level cold-core trough,[27] which generated stronger wind shear and caused the storm to weaken. Early on August\u00a022, Dorothy degenerated into a trough south of Puerto Rico.[21] Throughout the Lesser Antilles, Dorothy produced high winds and heavy rainfall. On Martinique, large amounts of precipitation resulted in flooding and mudslides, which in turn, caused bridge collapses and damage to homes.[28] In addition, strong tropical storm force winds were also reported on the island. The storm destroyed 186\u00a0homes and left 700\u00a0people homeless.[29] Banana, sugar cane, and other crops sustained heavy losses. Flooding rains also overspread Dominica and Guadeloupe, but with less severe effects.[28][30] While the exact death toll of Dorothy is unknown, some sources claim that as many as 51 fatalities occurred.[27] Storm damage amounted to $34\u00a0million.[28]"

Despite the presence of wind shear, the depression intensified as its area of thunderstorms expanded. On September\u00a05, the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system and estimated sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h), making it a tropical storm. The continued shear displaced the thunderstorms to the east of the center, as the circulation began moving to the west-southwest. On September\u00a07, the storm weakened back to a tropical depression. On September\u00a011, it passed north of the Lesser Antilles, still as a weak depression.

Hours later, the system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella.[3] A ridge to the north caused it to curve in a general westward direction.[1] Just six hours after becoming a tropical storm, Ella intensified into a hurricane early on September\u00a011. While approaching the Gulf Coast of Mexico, the cyclone deepened significantly, peaking as a Category\u00a03 hurricane on September\u00a012 with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 967\u00a0mbar (28.56\u00a0inHg). Shortly thereafter, Ella made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, at the same intensity. The hurricane rapidly weakened inland, falling to tropical storm intensity on September\u00a013 and dissipating several hours later.[3] In the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, wind gusts of 55\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) were observed.[31] Ella brought heavy rainfall to portions of northeastern Mexico.[32] Several homes were destroyed and villages along the San Marcos River were inundated by water.[33] One girl died after her house collapsed. Flooding and continuous precipitation prevented the transportation of relief items, including food and medicine, by helicopters.[34] In Texas, tides peaked at 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) above normal, but no coastal flooding damage was reported.[35]"

Felice tracked northwestward and brushed southern Louisiana on September\u00a015, before making landfall near Galveston, Texas, later that day. Once ashore, Felice quickly deteriorated as it recurved into the central United States, dissipating on September\u00a018.[3] While over southeastern Oklahoma, however, its remnants still closely resembled a formidable tropical cyclone.[36] In advance of the cyclone, officials advised residents in vulnerable communities to evacuate their homes,[37] and temporary storm shelters were established.[38] However, the effects from Felice were generally light. Beneficial rains fell over parts of southern Florida,[39] while sections of coastal Louisiana experienced minimal gale-force winds and above-normal tides.[40] In Texas, winds gusting to 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) at Galveston\u2014and estimated near 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) elsewhere\u2014caused scattered power outages and minor tree damage,[41] while heavy rainfall totaling over 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) triggered some street flooding.[10][41] Felice delayed the local rice harvest and ruined some hay that had been cut before the storm.[41] Significant precipitation and gusty winds accompanied the system into northern Texas and Oklahoma.[36]"

On September\u00a030, a flight from the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined circulation, while ships in the area reported gale-force winds; these observations indicated that a tropical storm had developed. The storm moved west-southwestward, passing St. Lucia and St. Vincent into the Caribbean Sea on October\u00a02. It weakened thereafter, briefly degenerating into a trough before redeveloping into a tropical depression on October\u00a05. It re-intensified into a tropical storm as it meandered south of Hispaniola, eventually hitting the Dominican Republic on October\u00a08 as a tropical depression. It crossed the island into the Atlantic and moved northeastward ahead of an approaching cold front, briefly becoming a tropical storm again on October\u00a010. The storm became extratropical as it integrated with the trough on October\u00a011, moving quickly to the east and east-northeast. Thunderstorms increased on October\u00a014, and a day later, the stalled about halfway between the Azores and Madeira due to a ridge over northern Europe. By that time, the system became integrated with an upper-level low while no longer associated with the front; as a result, it became a subtropical storm. Turning back to the west, the storm re-intensified, becoming a fully tropical hurricane on October\u00a017. A day later, it attained peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h). The hurricane turned to the north, weakening back to a tropical storm on October\u00a020. A day later, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which was absorbed by another cyclone southeast of Greenland on October\u00a022.[21] The system produced heavy rainfall in the Lesser Antilles, reaching 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) on Barbados;[42] it left three deaths and moderate damage on the island.[43] Another death was reported in the United States Virgin Islands. Torrential rainfall in Puerto Rico inflicted heavy damage, with precipitation peaking at 41.68\u00a0in (1,059\u00a0mm) in Jayuya,[10] of which 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm) fell in a 24\u2011hour period, far exceeding the peak rainfall amounts during the 1928 and 1899 hurricanes.[6] Most of the damage was inflicted to sugar cane and coffee crops.[44] Additionally, at least 600\u00a0houses were destroyed and another 1,000\u00a0sustained damage,[45] while about 10,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[44] The storm affected at least 40\u00a0state roads,[46] including 15\u00a0blocked by landslides, and 11\u00a0bridges destroyed.[47] Overall, damage in Puerto Rico totaled $65\u00a0million.

As the system moved over warmer waters, a surface low formed on September\u00a026.[48] As a result of gale-force winds being observed, the system was then designated as Tropical Storm Greta. However, the storm did not strengthen, despite favorable conditions, and as a result, it was described by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a \"bomb that did not explode\".[1][49] While approaching the Florida Keys, Greta abruptly weakened to a tropical depression, coinciding with deterioration of the cloud pattern. In addition, Hurricane Hunters reported rising pressures and lower winds. On the evening of September\u00a027, Greta made landfall in Key West, Florida, with sustained winds of 26\u00a0mph (42\u00a0km/h).[49] Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Greta did not re-intensify, though it retained a closed circulation while moving around a high-pressure area. It moved across the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, though it quickly re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually, Greta made landfall near Tampico, Mexico, on October\u00a05, and dissipated shortly thereafter.[1] Due to the weak nature of the storm, minimal impact was reported. In Florida, tides were generally minor, and were no more than 3 and 4 feet (0.91 and 1.22\u00a0m) above normal, as reported in the Florida Keys.[50] Rainfall was mostly light, though 8.94\u00a0in (227\u00a0mm) of precipitation was observed in Fort Pierce.[48]"

Twelve hours later, the storm strengthened into a hurricane,[3] shortly before passing near Bermuda.[51] It continued to intensify and briefly became a Category\u00a02 hurricane on October\u00a017. The hurricane then accelerated rapidly northeastward,[3] and made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland as a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a017.[3][52] The hurricane produced high winds on Bermuda, canceling classes, interrupting transportation, and closing businesses, though damage was minimal.[53] In addition, light rain fell on the island.[10] Throughout Newfoundland, hurricane-force winds caused damage to structures, mostly in the form of broken windows. Rough seas along the Atlantic coast of the island damaged fishing dories and a fishing ramp. Heavy rainfall was also reported in some areas of the region, reaching nearly 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) in Quebec. Damage on the Burin Peninsula was in the thousands of Canadian dollars, although the specific figure is unknown. On the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, several buildings lost their roof due to high winds.[52]"

        "content": "A subtropical depression developed about 970\u00a0mi (1,560\u00a0km) east-northeast of Bermuda at 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a020. After intensifying into a subtropical storm early the following day, further strengthening was slow. Initially, the system northeastward, but curved southeastward on October\u00a024. During that time, it began acquiring characteristics of a tropical cyclone, transitioning into a tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC. The storm resumed its northeastward motion and continued to intensify. Early on October\u00a027, the storm strengthened into a hurricane.[3] based on a report of winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) from the Pretoria several hours later. At the time of hurricane intensity, it is likely that the hurricane-force wind field was only 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) in radius and its tropical storm force wind field was only 69\u00a0mi (111\u00a0km) in diameter.[1] By 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm and began accelerating. About 24\u00a0hours later, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated approximately 500\u00a0mi (800\u00a0km) north-northeast of Graciosa in the Azores.[3]"

        "content": "Toward the end of November, a cold front moved across the Atlantic Ocean, generating an extratropical storm near Bermuda on November\u00a025. Thunderstorms developed near the center as the system's wind field contracted. On November\u00a027, the storm turned southward toward warmer waters and gradually dissociated itself from the cold front. On November\u00a028, it transitioned into a subtropical storm, as its convection evolved into a comma-like structure. At that time, the system had peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). On November\u00a029, the storm turned to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front. A day later, the system transitioned into a tropical storm, by which time it was a small, well-organized cyclone with convection over the center. Late on December\u00a01, the storm became extratropical again as it became embedded within the cold front. It intensified while accelerating over the north-Atlantic, attaining winds of near hurricane-force. After turning eastward, the powerful extratropical storm passed south of Iceland on December\u00a04, and north of the United Kingdom a day later. The circulation dissipated on December\u00a06 while near Scandinavia.[21]"

        "content": "There were several minor systems that were also classified as depressions by the NHC. A tropical depression developed offshore of North Carolina on July\u00a028. Initially, the depression tracked toward the Outer Banks, but veered east-southeastward and avoided landfall. While nearing Bermuda on July\u00a030, the depression slowly curved north-northeastward. By late on August\u00a01, the depression dissipated while located east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The system might have briefly become a tropical storm, based on a ship reporting gale-force winds.[21] A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July\u00a031. It developed into a tropical depression developed on August\u00a02 near Cape Verde. It moved west-northwestward across the eastern-North Atlantic Ocean and eventually curved nearly due eastward. The depression dissipated about halfway between Puerto Rico and the west coast of Africa on August\u00a06. Another tropical depression developed near the African coast on August\u00a011. A day later, it degenerated into a tropical wave, which continued westward across the Atlantic. On August\u00a017, the remnants redeveloped into a tropical depression to the north of the Lesser Antilles. It turned northeastward and encountered wind shear, dissipating again on August\u00a018.[21] On August\u00a029, convection increased over the western Caribbean as a tropical wave approached the area, which subsequently moved into the Gulf of Mexico. On September\u00a01, a tropical depression developed near the coast of Texas, and at 22:00\u00a0UTC, the system moved ashore near Corpus Christi. The depression moved northward, dissipating on September\u00a02.[21] Another tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on September\u00a04, developing into a tropical depression the next day. The system moved west-southwestward for much of its duration and dissipated by September\u00a07. Later that month, the next system formed just east of Cape Verde on September\u00a022. The depression dissipated on September\u00a025, after moving northwestward across the far eastern Atlantic.[6] The tail-end of a front dropped into the southern Caribbean during the first week of November. An area of low pressure formed amid widespread thunderstorm activity on November\u00a08, but the system fluctuated in organization over later days as it moved slowly offshore Nicaragua. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a013, a tropical depression finally formed near San Andr\u00e9s. The system recurved northeast and reached winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) as it developed some spiral banding features. However, an approaching front moving into the northwestern Caribbean soon imparted shear on the system, causing it to dissipate between Grand Cayman and the Swan Islands early on November\u00a015.[21]"

        "content": "The 1894 Greater Antilles hurricane, also known as the San Mateo storm in Puerto Rico and the Huracan de Sagua la Grande in Cuba,[1] caused significant impacts in Hispaniola, Cuba, and along the East Coast of the United States, especially in Florida. The fourth known tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the season, this system was first observed well east of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a018. Gradually intensifying as it headed west-northwestward, the cyclone became a hurricane on September\u00a019 and a major hurricane on the next day while passing near Martinique. After entering the Caribbean Sea, the storm peaked with winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a021, but weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale prior to making landfall in the Dominican Republic late on September\u00a022. Although the system weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane before reaching the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve, the cyclone briefly became a Category\u00a02 hurricane again before striking Cuba near Santiago de Cuba on September\u00a023. Moving west-northwestward along or near the south coast of Cuba, the hurricane turned northward over Matanzas Province on September\u00a024 and briefly weakened to a tropical storm. The cyclone re-intensified into a hurricane as it emerged into the Straits of Florida on September\u00a025 and then made two landfalls in Florida on that day, first on Key West and then near Punta Rassa. After turning north-northeastward and briefly weakening to a tropical storm again, the system re-attained hurricane status shortly before re-entering the Atlantic on September\u00a026. The hurricane made another landfall near Port Royal, South Carolina, early on September\u00a027. Thereafter, the cyclone curved north-northeastward and weakened to a tropical storm over far southeastern North Carolina early on September\u00a028. Briefly re-emerging into the Atlantic, the cyclone made its final landfall near Atlantic Beach. After again emerging into the Atlantic, the storm became a hurricane on September\u00a029. However, the cyclone weakened back to a tropical storm on September\u00a030. The storm was last noted on October\u00a01 east of New England. The cyclone produced squalls and rough seas in the Lesser Antilles, leading to 10\u00a0deaths on Saint Kitts and 3\u00a0more fatalities on Antigua due to capsized vessels. Damage also occurred to agriculture, communications, trees, and roads in the region. Numerous structures on Hispaniola suffered some degree of damage, with 500\u00a0homes and 2\u00a0churches destroyed. In Cuba, flooding occurred across much of the island, especially in Sagua La Grande after the Sagua la Grande River overflowed, with floodwaters reaching 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) above ground in a hotel. The storm destroyed roughly 70\u00a0homes and substantially damaged 200\u00a0others, rendering about 3,000\u00a0families homeless. Approximately 200\u00a0people died in Cuba as a result of the storm, while damage in the country totaled about $4\u00a0million. Rough seas capsized or destroyed several vessels offshore Florida, causing 14\u00a0deaths. Winds damaged a number of structures in the state, especially in Jacksonville and Tampa, while storm surge and abnormally high tides entered several buildings in St. Augustine. Damage throughout Florida totaled about $1\u00a0million. Adverse conditions produced by the storm caused some impacts farther north, primarily crop damage and coastal flooding, including more than $75,000 in damage in New York."

The cyclone moved west-northwestward and gradually intensified, reaching hurricane status around 06:00\u00a0UTC on the following day. By early on September\u00a020, the storm is estimated to have strengthened into a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Further intensification occurred, with the system becoming a Category\u00a03 hurricane around 18:00\u00a0UTC as it passed just north of Martinique. The cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) early on September\u00a021 while entering the eastern Caribbean Sea.[2] As it approached Hispaniola, the storm weakened slightly and fell to Category\u00a02 intensity before making landfall in the present-day Dominican Republic near the Azua\u2013Barahona provinces border with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a022. The cyclone quickly weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane before emerging into the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve near Port-au-Prince, Haiti, several hours later. Around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, the system re-intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane just prior to making landfall in Cuba near Santiago de Cuba with winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h). The storm quickly weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane again and then moved along or close to the south coast of Cuba throughout much of September\u00a023 and early on September\u00a024, before turning northwestward near Playa Gir\u00f3n in Matanzas Province shortly after 06:00\u00a0UTC. Late on September\u00a024, the hurricane briefly weakened to a tropical storm, but soon re-strengthened into a hurricane early on September\u00a025 after emerging into the Straits of Florida about halfway between Havana and Matanzas.[2] After moving generally northward across the Straits of Florida, the cyclone made landfall in Key West, Florida, around 11:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a025 with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Reanalysis suggests that the hurricane intensified further, becoming a Category\u00a02 hurricane again by 18:00\u00a0UTC, about one hour before striking near Punta Rassa, Florida, with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h).[2] Upon landfall, the system had an atmospheric pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg), the lowest known in relation to the storm.[1] The hurricane curved north-northeastward and briefly weakened to a tropical storm near Orlando around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026, before re-strengthening into a hurricane just prior to emerging into the Atlantic near modern-day Palm Coast about six hours later. At about 07:00\u00a0UTC on the following day, the system made landfall near Port Royal, South Carolina, with winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). The hurricane then curved east-northward and weakened to a tropical storm over far southeastern North Carolina early on September\u00a028. Briefly re-emerging into the Atlantic, the cyclone made another landfall near Atlantic Beach with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). After again entering the Atlantic from northern Dare County, the storm re-intensified into a hurricane early on September\u00a029. However, the cyclone weakened back to a tropical storm about 24\u00a0hours later while passing offshore New Jersey. The storm was last noted early on October\u00a01 about 120\u00a0mi (195\u00a0km) east of Nantucket, Massachusetts.[2]"

Additionally, the hurricane wrecked the schooner Lettie Linwood, partially demolished a jetty, and damaged roads.[4] Strong winds on Guadeloupe toppled many trees and telegraph wires in Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre, severing communications with interior parts of the island.[5] Wind gusts over 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) were observed at the weather station in Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico.[3] Throughout Hispaniola, the hurricane destroyed more than five hundred homes and two churches; numerous other structures sustained damage, mainly having their roofs blown off.[6] The storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of Cuba, especially in the central parts of the country, where an observation station recorded 6.6\u00a0in (167\u00a0mm) of precipitation on September\u00a023 and an additional 9.5 inches (242\u00a0mm) of rainfall on the following day. Consequently, the Mayaneya, Sagua la Grande, Yabucito, and Yabu overflowed.[7] In Sagua La Grande, approximately one-third of the town's residents evacuated,[3] while those unable to escape climbed to the roofs of two-story structures.[7] Floodwaters reached 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) above ground at the railroad tracks, while up to 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) of water was reported inside a hotel. Some sources indicated that floodwaters reached as high as 75 to 95\u00a0ft (23 to 29\u00a0m) above ground, though meteorologist Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Partag\u00e1s strongly doubted these reports, \"it seems too high even if it were in feet instead of meters\".[3] Several other communities in central Cuba experienced flooding, including Cruces, Lajas, and Santo Domingo. Much of the region also reported extensive losses to sugarcane and heavy damage to gas works and electric plants. The cyclone left approximately 3,000\u00a0families homeless, with about 70\u00a0homes destroyed and 200\u00a0others severely damaged. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 47\u00a0homes in Santa Cruz del Sur.[7] Approximately 200\u00a0fatalities occurred in Cuba,[8] while damage totaled approximately $4\u00a0million.[7] On September\u00a024, the Weather Bureau ordered storm signals in Florida for the Cedar Keys, Jupiter, Punta Gorda, and Tampa, before soon expanding the warned area to include Wilmington, North Carolina, to New Orleans, Louisiana.[9] The Weather Bureau also predicted violent gales in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina.[3] Additionally, shipping interests as far north as New York City received notice of the storm on September\u00a024, particularly for vessels heading southward.[9] In Florida, the island of Key West observed 5-minute sustained winds of 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and gusts up to 104\u00a0mph (167\u00a0km/h), while the captain of the schooner Consiston, situated just west of Key West, estimated that winds reached as high as 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h).[3] The island experienced its worst storm since 1876. Winds downed many trees and fences, though most buildings sustained little damage. Many cigar factories lost a significant amount of their products after water entered the buildings, while shipping also suffered extensive losses.[10] Unconfirmed reports initially stated that the schooner Emily B. sank near Key West with the loss of the entire crew.[11] However, The Tropical Sun later reported that both the ship and crew were safe.[12] Farther east, the barque Brandon capsized at Crocker Reef, drowning 14 of the 17\u00a0men aboard, including the captain.[3] The storm dropped heavy rainfall across mainland Florida, including a 54-hour total of 13.78\u00a0in (350\u00a0mm) of precipitation in Tampa, a storm total of 11.11\u00a0in (282\u00a0mm) in Jacksonville, and a 48-hour total of 7.72\u00a0in (196\u00a0mm) in Titusville.[3] Offshore, the ship Julia became stranded at Hillsboro Inlet, while two bodies, several wine caskets, and other merchandise washed ashore between the Lake Worth Lagoon and New River.[11] The storm swept away a bridge along the Lake Worth Lagoon.[13] At Jupiter, thousands of dead fish washed ashore.[14] The town recorded sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[3] Several cigar factories were wrecked in Tampa. The storm also destroyed many smaller homes and buildings, as well as a church and hotel. Damage to buildings alone in Tampa reached approximately $50,000. Watercraft in the St. Johns River at Palatka suffered significant impact and 12\u00a0wharves between Palatka and Green Cove Springs disappeared. In St. Augustine, storm surge and abnormally high tides overtopped the seawalls and \"made rivers of the streets\", according to The Times-Union. Water entered many homes and the Ponce de Leon Hotel.[15] In Jacksonville, strong winds and heavy rainfall deroofed the city's largest hotel, the Everett Hotel. The storm also destroyed an unfinished railroad station and two homes.[16] Nearby, abnormally high tides caused extensive damage in Mayport and Pablo Beach, with all of the docks and wharves destroyed at the former.[17] Throughout the state, a loss of about 20% of orange crops occurred. Overall, damage in Florida exceeded $1\u00a0million.[15] In Georgia, the Sea Islands \"escaped with practically no damage.\", according to the Savannah Morning News. Wind gusts reached 88\u00a0mph (142\u00a0km/h) on Tybee Island, destroying a windmill. On Isle of Hope, a few fruit trees and fences fell over.[18] The hurricane downed some trees branches and limbs and toppled telegraph and telephone wires in Savannah.[19] Coastal regions of South Carolina and other areas slightly farther inland experienced major damage to corn, cotton, and rice crops.[20] Tides reached about 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) above normal at Charleston.[1] At Cape Romain, the schooner Benjamin F. Lee wrecked, with the ship and cargo having a combined value of about $18,000.[21] Some parts of coastal North Carolina reported strong winds, including 5-minute sustained wind speeds of 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) in Southport and 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in Kitty Hawk.[22] In Virginia, Cape Henry observed 5-minute sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), along with gusts up to 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h).[23] These winds severed telegraph lines along the coast.[20] Princess Anne County, now part of Virginia Beach, suffered some loss of corn and potato crops. Two tenement houses were destroyed.[24] On Cobb Island, waves washed away about 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) of sand and inundated the island with about 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) of water, sweeping away outhouses, fences, some pigs, and all vegetation.[25] In New Jersey, the hurricane produced rough surf in the vicinity of Atlantic City, while the Asbury Park Press noted that \"the meadows between this city [Atlantic City] and the mainland are like a great bay.\"[26] Tides generated by the storm in New York swept away about 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) of the outer bulkhead and severely damaged the inner bulkhead at Brighton Beach, causing a portion of the Brighton Beach Hotel to sag enough to induce fears of its collapse. The cyclone also washed out the marine railway from Brighton Beach to Manhattan Beach, including tearing up boardwalks and platforms leading to the former. Additionally, a pavilion bar and lunch room were carried away. Conservative estimates placed damage in New York at over $75,000.[27] The storm wrecked a number of vessels as far north as New England.[23] Strong winds along coastal Massachusetts led to a large loss of fruit from trees in Plymouth.[28] A large elm tree fell in Lynn, causing serious injuries to a woman.[29]"

The thirty-ninth tropical depression, twenty-fifth tropical storm, and fourteenth system to affect Vietnam in the 2017 Pacific typhoon season,[1] Kirogi formed as a tropical depression on November 16 in the Moro Gulf. After being given the local name Tino by the PAGASA, it entered the South China Sea, intensifying into a tropical storm and receiving the name Kirogi from the Japan Meteorological Agency on November 18. Continuing westwards, it weakened into a tropical depression before making landfall near Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam on the next day, dissipating shortly afterwards. Kirogi's remnants later contributed to the formation of Cyclone Ockhi. Kirogi caused flooding in the Philippines and Vietnam, with trees and power poles toppling in Ho Chi Minh City.

        "content": "On November 15 at 15:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of convection approximately 355 nautical miles (655\u00a0km; 410\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Mindanao for potential development, estimating its development chances within the next day as low. The system was disorganized, with an exposed and ill-defined low-level circulation.[2] The system moved over more favorable conditions for development as the low-level circulation began to consolidate, and at 20:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system's development chances within the next day to medium.[3] On November 16 at 12:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed that a tropical depression had formed over the Moro Gulf,[4] and at 21:00 UTC, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system.[5] On November 17 at 02:00 UTC, the PAGASA assessed that the system developed into a tropical depression, assigning it the local name Tino.[6] Four hours later at 06:00 UTC, the JTWC assessed that Tino had developed into a tropical depression, assigning it the designation 31W.[7] At 09:00 UTC, Tino made landfall on Puerto Princesa[6] before entering into the South China Sea. Tino entered the South China Sea as a disorganized system, with a weak low-level circulation and shallow convective bands. Conditions in the area were relatively favorable, with sea surface temperatures of 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), favorable outflow, and vertical wind shear at 15\u201320 knots (30\u201335\u00a0km/h; 15\u201325\u00a0mph) which was partially negated by the system's motion; development was partly limited due to northeasterly dry air.[8] The JTWC upgraded Tino to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC[7] as the system's low-level circulation became partially exposed;[9] the JMA followed on November 18 at 00:00 UTC, assigning it the international name Kirogi. The JMA estimated that Kirogi peaked in intensity at the same time, with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 1000\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.53\u00a0inHg).[4] At 02:00 UTC, Kirogi left the Philippine Area of Responsibility[6] as its convection became displaced towards the west and northwest.[10] At 18:00 UTC, the JTWC estimated maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph);[7] convection began to fragment and collapse during the surrounding hours as an anticyclone continued to displace the convection, hindering the system's development.[11][12] On November 19 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA downgraded Kirogi to a tropical depression,[4] before making landfall south-southwest of Cam Ranh Bay[13] and being downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC at 06:00 UTC.[7] Kirogi was downgraded to a disturbance by the JTWC at 12:00 UTC,[7] with the JMA estimating the system to have dissipated.[4] Kirogi's remnants would later move into the Gulf of Thailand on November 20[14] and into the Andaman Sea on November 21,[15] later contributing to the formation of Cyclone Ockhi.[16]"

The storm moved northeastward toward Greece, gradually intensifying and developing characteristics of a tropical cyclone. On September\u00a029, the storm made landfall at peak intensity in the Peloponnese, west of Kalamata, where a minimum central pressure of 989.3\u00a0mbar (29.21\u00a0inHg) was reported.[2] ESTOFEX reported on Zorbas as \"Mediterranean Cyclone 2018M02\", with the same pressure of 989\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg) at Kalamata, further estimating the minimum central pressure of the cyclone to be 987\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg), with one-minute maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a Dvorak number of T4.0, which all translate into marginal Category 1 hurricane characteristics for the cyclone.[7] Early on 1 October, Zorbas emerged into the Aegean Sea, while accelerating northeastward.[8] On 2 October, Zorbas moved over northwestern Turkey and dissipated.[9] A cold wake was observed in the Mediterranean Sea, with sea surface temperatures dropping 3\u20134\u00a0\u00b0C (5\u20137\u00a0\u00b0F) along the track of Zorbas due to strong upwelling.[10] It is unknown who named the system Zorbas, but the name is officially recognized for a medicane by the Deutscher Wetterdienst.[11]"

As a result, its center became fully exposed and far removed to the west of the deep convection the following day.[7] Even so, there was a convective burst that formed near the center of circulation center late on September\u00a026,[8] which continued into the following day. A convective band also began developing on the eastern side of the circulation.[9] Philippe's structure deteriorated somewhat on September\u00a028, with satellite images showing an elongated circulation and multiple centers. As there was some deep convection on the east and southeast sides of what NHC determined was the main center, the system still met the requisite criteria of a tropical cyclone.[10] The storm also stalled, generally drifting to the southwest due to its interaction with Tropical Storm Rina to its east. Philippe remained adrift the following morning, and sheared, with the low-level center pushed to near the western edge of the main area of deep convection.[11] Philippe continued moving erratically for the next few days, strong northwesterly wind shear precluded any significant strengthening from occurring during this time.[12] On October\u00a02, the storm turned toward the northwest, and made landfall on Barbuda that evening.[13] Satellite imagery showed a sheared, asymmetrical storm.[14] Early on October 6, a large extratropical low formed west of Philippe, resulting in the rapid degradation of Philippe's structure. Philippe was fully absorbed by the other low by 12:00 UTC that day, about 175\u00a0mi (280\u00a0km) south of Bermuda.[15]"

The fifth named storm and second hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Earl formed from a tropical wave south of Jamaica on August 2. The precursor to Earl brought torrential rainfall and flooding to the Lesser Antilles. Upon classification, the storm moved westward through the Caribbean Sea, brushing the north coast of Honduras. Earl strengthened into an 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) hurricane before making landfall on Belize on August\u00a04. It weakened while moving across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, but reintensified in the Bay of Campeche and followed the coastline. On August 6, Earl dissipated after moving ashore Veracruz. Prior to Earl becoming a tropical cyclone, 13\u00a0people died in storm-related incidents across the Dominican Republic. Striking Belize as a Category\u00a01, the hurricane caused extensive damage; losses to agriculture exceeded US$100\u00a0million. Heavy rain in Mexico triggered many landslides, several of which proved fatal in the states of Puebla, Hidalgo, and Veracruz; at least 81\u00a0people died in the country. Lesser effects were felt in neighboring countries in Central America. Despite the high death toll from the storm, the name Earl was not retired."

        "content": "On July 25, 2016, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic along the coast of West Africa. The wave's emergence over water was accompanied by a surge in moisture, leading to the development of scattered convection.[1] Early on July 26, a 1010\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.83\u00a0inHg) surface low developed along the wave axis (confirmed by scatterometer data and nearby observations);[2] however, this feature was transient and soon dissipated.[3] Moving quickly westward, the system was expected to encounter more favorable conditions for development within three days.[4] The rapid motion prevented initial development,[5] resulting in poor organization of the associated convection.[6] The thunderstorms increased on July 30 as the wave began moving through the Lesser Antilles,[7] assisted by above-normal water temperatures and light wind shear.[8] Despite more convective organization and the presence of strong winds, the lack of a surface circulation prevented the system from being classified as a tropical cyclone.[9] On July 31, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea while continuing its fast forward motion.[10] While passing south of the Dominican Republic on August 1, the system became much better organized, producing tropical storm-force winds in its northern periphery.[11] The fast forward motion allowed the system to develop despite an increase in upper-level wind shear, although the shear decreased as water temperatures increased along the wave's path.[12] A Hurricane Hunters mission was scheduled to fly into the system on August 1, but it could not investigate because of mechanical problems.[13] Early on August 2, the system passed south of Jamaica,[14] and a Hurricane Hunters flight was able to observe a closed circulation. As a result, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Storm Earl at 16:00\u00a0UTC that day, located 215\u00a0mi (350\u00a0km) south-southeast of Grand Cayman and situated between Jamaica and northeastern Honduras.[15] Upon its classification, Earl was still moving quickly westward, steered by the strong flow of a ridge located over the southern United States.[15] Earl gradually intensified after its development[16] and developed a mid-level eye feature. The center reformed more to the south, bringing Earl close to the northern coastline of Honduras and into the Gulf of Honduras.[17] Late on August 3, observations from the Hurricane Hunters indicated that Earl intensified into a hurricane near the Bay Islands.[18] The eyewall, visible from the coast of Belize, was closed at times[19] and the peak winds briefly increased to 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[20] Around 06:00\u00a0UTC on August 4, Earl made landfall about 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) south of Belize City, Belize, at this intensity.[21] Moving over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and across the mountainous terrain of northern Guatemala, Earl quickly weakened; its convection diminished, although its circulation remained well-defined.[22] By late on August 4, the convection was limited to a small area southeast of the center, and close proximity to land was expected to limit development.[23] On August 5, most of the circulation of Earl emerged into the southern Bay of Campeche.[24] Later that day, a Hurricane Hunters mission indicated that the storm re-intensified and had sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), reporting flight-level winds of 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h).[25] At 02:00\u00a0UTC on August 6, Earl made its final landfall just south of Veracruz. The storm rapidly weakened over the mountains of eastern Mexico,[26] and the circulation dissipated by 15:00\u00a0UTC. Moisture from the storm interacted with a disturbance on the Pacific coast of Mexico,[27] which the NHC monitored as an area for development and soon developed into Tropical Storm Javier.[28]"

The Cayman Islands Government issued a tropical storm watch for all three islands. Fishermen were also advised to remain at port in both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.[13] After Earl formed, the government of Honduras issued a tropical storm warning for its entire northern coastline, from Cape Gracias a Dios westward to the border with Guatemala.[29] Two international airports along the northern coast were closed, and classes in seven departments were canceled.[30][31] A red alert was issued for the offshore Bay Islands, advising residents in at-risk areas to evacuate.[32][33] In northern Guatemala, about 2,000\u00a0people evacuated due to the storm,[34] including around 100\u00a0people in Melchor de Mencos.[33] Classes were canceled in Pet\u00e9n and Izabal departments,[35] and the Mundo Maya International Airport was closed.[36] The government of El Salvador advised residents to take caution when boating or fishing due to the storm's threat.[37] The governments of Belize and Mexico also issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch from Belize's border with Guatemala northward to Punta Allen,[29] which was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Belize's border with Guatemala to Costa Maya, Mexico, after Earl intensified.[38] The Belize Red Cross Society distributed messages about the hurricane via social media.[39] Across the country, 29\u00a0shelters were opened,[33] housing 2,500\u00a0people.[40] Non-essential government workers were allowed to return home to secure their property.[41] The Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport closed during the storm's passage,[42] but was reopened on August\u00a04. During the storm, schools, businesses, and ports were closed, while hospitals were on standby.[43] Officials in Mexico opened 750\u00a0emergency shelters in Quintana Roo, helping 300\u00a0families to evacuate along a river in the southeastern portion of the state.[33] In Tabasco state, the military activated 1,500\u00a0troops for relief work,[44] while along the Bay of Campeche, offshore petroleum companies evacuated their workers.[30]"

        "content": " The October 2022 Southern Ocean cyclone, also referred to as the Peter I storm[1] or EC2022[2] was the most intense extratropical cyclone on record. Forming as a weak depression near Tonga late on 9 October, the extratropical cyclone tracked slowly southeastward across the South Pacific, remaining weak. Starting on 14 October, the cyclone began rapid deepening as it moved towards Antarctica. Deepening rates peaked on 16 October, where the pressure fell as rapidly as 19\u00a0mbar (0.56\u00a0inHg) over a six-hour period. The storm peaked early on 17 October in the Bellingshausen Sea, with a minimum pressure of around 900\u00a0mbar (26.58\u00a0inHg). The cyclone moved slowly in a loop, rising in pressure over the next few days before dissipating on 20 October. The cyclone's pressure has been estimated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) as 900.7\u00a0mbar (26.60\u00a0inHg) at 06:00 UTC on 17 October. An analysis paper published in Geophysical Research Letters in July\u00a02023 got a minimum pressure of 899.91\u00a0mbar (26.574\u00a0inHg) at 03:00 UTC the same day. These pressures would make the extratropical cyclone the most intense since at least the start of the satellite era; for comparison, the most intense extratropical cyclone known over the North Atlantic was the Braer Storm in 1993, with a pressure of 914\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg)."

The status of the Southern Ocean is disputed,[3] with it being an official ocean on the 2002 draft of Limits of Oceans and Seas by the International Hydrographic Organization.[4] However, the draft has not been published due to several naming disputes of different bodies of water, primarily the Sea of Japan.[5] Extratropical cyclones in the Southern Ocean have been observed to be stronger than Northern Hemisphere cyclones at the same latitude. Cyclones in the Southern Ocean tend to have lowest pressures in mid-late September, when Antarctic sea ice is at is maximum. The lower pressures are likely caused by less friction against sea ice rather than ocean waves.[1] As there are limited weather stations in the region, pressures in the region are calculated using results from ECMWF models and ERA5 reanalysis data using 13 different variables including temperature, potential vorticity and 10 meter wind.[2]"

The cyclone spent around a day moving slowly near the island before moving southeastward on 11 October. The cyclone started to deepen on 13 October and rapidly move across the Southeast Pacific. During this time, the isobars along the southeastern side of the cyclone elongated with additional development taking place on the eastern side. This caused an accelerated movement of the cyclone between 06:00 UTC and 12:00 UTC on 13 October.  At this time, the associated warm front with this extratropical cyclone started to deepen and turn poleward. Explosive cyclogenesis occurred on the 16th, with the storm's central pressure falling as rapidly as 19\u00a0mbar (0.56\u00a0inHg) over a six-hour period. A paper in Geophysical Research Letters first identified the cyclone at 03:00 UTC on this date. The cyclone's peak intensity occurred early on 17 October near Peter I Island in the Bellingshausen Sea. The cyclone then executed a clockwise loop in the Bellingshausen Sea for three days while rising in pressure. The ECMWF concluded that the cyclone lost its identity on 20 October while the Geophysical Research Letters paper called a dissipation two days later in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean.[1][2] The cyclone lasted roughly for ten days, much longer than typical cyclones in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, although some summer cyclones in the Arctic Ocean have been observed to last as long.[1]"

They note that the storm originating in the tropics might have helped the pressure of the cyclone get so low.[1] A subsequent analysis published in Geophysical Research Letters in July\u00a02023 estimated a minimum central pressure of 899.91\u00a0mbar (26.574\u00a0inHg) at 03:00\u00a0UTC 17 October.[2]"

        "content": "Vietnam is a Southeast Asian country with a subtropical climate in the north and a tropical climate in the central and southern regions, which are easily influenced by monsoons. The southwest monsoon from May to October each year brings a large amount of rainfall to the exposed areas, namely the north and south.[5] According to Visual Capitalist Vietnam ranks third globally in terms of the proportion of people most at risk of flooding, with 46% of its 98 million population at risk of flooding.[6] Vietnam is a country with severe flood disasters. Rainfall, tides, storms, and tropical depressions are natural factors that cause floods. Due to Vietnam's abundant rainfall, with an average annual rainfall of 1,500 to 2,500 millimetres,[5] heavy rain often leads to flooding in cities with poor drainage systems. This tropical storm no. 9 caused dangerous (Level II) and extremely dangerous (Level III) floods in several major river basins in central provinces.[1] As of 7:00 am on 20 October, the rainfall in the above-mentioned provinces ranged from 100 millimetres to 470 millimetres, exceeding the monthly average level.[2] As of 1 November, the rivers from Yi'an Province to Pingding Province exceeded the Level III warning. The continuous floods, combined with landslides, caused serious damage to roads, dams, and infrastructure.[1] At the height of the flood, the heavily affected Hue Street in Chengtian Hue Province was flooded with up to three meters of water, and telecommunications services in that area and other parts of the eight central provinces were suspended.[7] From 1 to 3 November, under the influence of a strong cold air front and tropical conversion activities, the central provinces from Guangping to Pingding experienced heavy to extremely heavy rainstorm. The combined effect of the South China Sea low pressure zone and the tail of the cold front caused a short-term concentrated rainstorm. Some mountainous areas in Guangnan Province and Chengtian Huhua Province experienced flash floods, and serious flooding occurred on the riverbanks from Guangnan Province to Pingding Province.[2][8] The rainstorm lasted for seven consecutive days from 1 to 7 November. Due to the large range, concentration of rainfall, 90% of the hilly areas were flooded quickly. The water level of Perfume River and Bo River, the two major rivers in Shunhua, sometimes rose to 8-9m.[9] As of 7 November, temporary statistical data provided by the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC), a UNDP sponsored program for disaster monitoring in Vietnam, it was estimated that the two week flood had caused more than 500 deaths, and people's communication, transportation, and housing were severely affected by the floods.[7]"

Specifically, 9,862 cases of eye infections were reported, 9,347 cases of diarrhoea, 1,096 cases of dysentery, and 16,460 cases of flu.[16] These figures demonstrate the severe impact and underscore the importance of implementing robust flood prevention measures in flood-prone regions, emphasising the necessity of medical knowledge and enhanced support both during and after floods.[17] The local population faced significant health risks, including psychological conditions, stemming from anxiety and the abrupt disturbance of their well-being, which may persist years beyond the receding floodwaters.[18][17] The shortage of findings about the effects of the floods on mental health reveals that conditions like anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remained neglected.[19]"

Intense winds generated fierce waves, complicating movement. According to a report published by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, sections of National Highway One, vital for connecting Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, remained inaccessible for days after the flooding, as did extensive stretches of the north-south railway. Damaged roads resulted in the isolation of three inland districts within Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Hu\u1ebf. Erosion rendered 11 villages in two districts practically isolating them as if they were islands. A total of 267 kilometres of roadway and 5,416 meters of water resource conduits and transportation dykes incurred substantial damage.[11] Despite significant material damage, including reports of 94,000 shattered classrooms, education remained remarkably resilient, as the majority of families persisted in enrolling their children in school, despite encountering economic challenges.[2][10]"

Poorer households heavily dependent on energy from carbohydrates, such as rice, increased their calorific intake but still lacked iron, calcium and vitamins[20][21] whilst richer households improved the quality of what they consumed.[21] This was a result of economic growth resulting in a decrease in food insecurity across the population.[22][23] Yet in 1998, roughly 80% of the poor worked in agriculture. This meant that most lived in isolated, rural areas or areas prone to disasters with undeveloped infrastructure [24] where food insecurity was higher.[25] Consequently, the 1999 floods resulted in widespread food shortages for over 1 million people, particularly those living in isolated, rural areas dependent on rice as a staple. This resulted in not enough nutrients being consumed[26] impacting children from rural and poor households the most since they were already suffering from malnutrition.[27] The floods destroyed 11,813 ha of paddy fields and damaged 63,726 ha of paddy fields, with further damage to 30,985 ha of other crops[7] (sugarcane, manioc, maize, sweet potatoes, and nuts).[28] A further 205,000 tons of food rotted, including staples such as rice which accounts for 85% of Vietnam's grain harvest[23][27] and 120,000 tons of rice seed was contaminated.[23] An estimated 693,154 livestock was also lost,[7] including an estimated 25,000 cows and buffaloes,[23] with surviving livestock potentially succumbing to epidemics that follow floods.[29] Isolated villages began to run out of food by 4 November with bad weather preventing food being airlifted. Hong Ha was one of the villages that did not have community food stocks due to a lack of surplus crops. This resulted in many families experiencing hunger when floodwaters destroyed their crops because food assistance did not arrive in Hong Ha until one week after the floods.[2] Food donations throughout Vietnam collected 100 tons of food by 10 November and Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Hu\u1ebf received a further 200 tons of food.[23] Rice aid was initially distributed equally to households experiencing food insecurity. Further rice deliveries were distributed based on household categorisation determined by how badly the flood had impacted them. Between 150 and 250\u00a0kg of rice was provided to each household and lasted two to three months.[2] Vegetable and bean seeds were provided by the Hue University of Agriculture and Forestry and many lowland households borrowed rice from neighbours with the intention of repaying after the next harvest. Once the rice aid was finished, households also lent and gave food to each other.[2] After the floods had subsided, due to the impact on crops, livestock and farmers, food security continued to be an issue for 80% of people living in the flooded region.[23]  The significant damage to paddy fields resulted in the winter-spring crop not being planted until March 2000. This resulted in a late harvest in October during the midst of the monsoon season in the central regions. Many poor households lost their main food source and income until the next harvest[30] but only 1% of official development assistance (ODA) was spent on food and emergency relief in 2000,[31] with healthcare spending equating to US$19 per capita.[32] There is an absence of data comparing food security between urban and rural areas. However, the poverty rate stagnated and the percentage of people suffering from food insecurity and undernutrition overall increased due to insufficient consumption of food.[32] (percentage of population under $5.50 per day) (percentage of population)"

The US also pledged US$450,000 to the Federation for household kits to the affected families and eight public health professionals arrived in Vietnam to conduct health assessments.[36] Financial help to flood victims in Vietnam was provided by several countries, including France, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, Hong Kong, China, and the EU countries.

The commune's People Committee and the district Education Section worked together to finance the repair of school buildings.[2] Individuals commonly took out loans to secure housing and prevent further vulnerability. Those from rural households, who often had less stable income, found it easier to access private loans with higher interest rates; they then experienced difficulty with repayments when production, and therefore income, post-flood remained unstable.[2] The Government, Red Cross and non-governmental organisations provided housing assistance to the poorest households.[2] Due to frequent flooding in central Vietnam, housing adaptations have been undertaken in affected areas to prevent the replication of the devastation caused by the 1999 floods. A field study in V\u00e2n Qu\u1eadt \u0110\u00f4ng in central Vietnam noted that houses built after the 1999 floods had noticeably higher elevated foundations compared with those built prior to 1999.[43] However, more effective flood prevention measures for housebuilding, such as two-storey houses made of durable material, is often too expensive for villagers and therefore they remain vulnerable to the effects of flooding.[43]"

Albeit very active, no tropical storms formed between mid June and early October because of a very strong southwest monsoon, a weather anomaly that caused the 2010 Pakistan floods."

It was initially disorganized, although satellite imagery indicated a mid-level circulation.[1] After a few days, the convection began consolidating around a developing low-level circulation, and rainbands became evident. With low amounts of wind shear in the region, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed its chances of development as fair.[2] The official warning agency in the basin \u2013 the India Meteorological Department (IMD) \u2013 classified the system as Depression BOB\u00a0001 at 0900\u00a0UTC on May\u00a017.[3] About three hours after the depression was first classified, the IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression, indicating sustained winds of at least 34\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h).[4] Late on May\u00a017, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 01B, based on further organization. By that time, it was located about 485\u00a0miles (780\u00a0km) east-southeast of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, and was moving westward due to its position southwest of the subtropical ridge.[5] The IMD upgraded the deep depression to Cyclonic Storm Laila early on May\u00a018.[6] With further consolidation of the convection throughout the day, the JTWC noted that the storm \"[appeared] to be rapidly intensifying\", which is a term referring to a quick drop in barometric pressure that usually coincides with a sharp increase in winds. By late on May\u00a018, an eye feature became evident on satellite imagery,[7] and at 0000\u00a0UTC on May\u00a019, the JTWC assessed Laila as producing peak winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), the equivalent of a minimal hurricane.[8] A few hours later, the IMD upgraded Laila to a severe cyclonic storm.[9] After reaching peak intensity, Laila briefly decelerated as it moved around tan increasing, and the cyclone began weakening as it remained just off the coast.[10] Between 1100 and 1200\u00a0UTC on May\u00a020, Laila made landfall near Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh.[11]"

Originating from an area of low pressure over the Bay of Bengal on October\u00a019, the system began as a weak depression 250\u00a0km (155\u00a0mi) south of Myanmar. Over the following few days, the depression underwent explosive intensification, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph 3-minute sustained) on October\u00a022. Cyclone Giri made landfall roughly 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) northwest of Kyaukpyu, shortly after peaking. Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened. By the following day, Giri had degenerated into a tropical depression and the final advisory was issued on the storm. Unlike during Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the Government of Myanmar took steps to ensure the safety of residents in the path of Cyclone Giri. An estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm. Throughout central Myanmar, at least 157 people are known to have been killed by Giri. Thousands of structures near where the storm made landfall were destroyed, leaving more than 70,000 people homeless. An international relief effort began shortly after the storm passed to assist survivors of the storm. Local and foreign media initially criticized the Myanmar government for not giving residents enough warning of the storm and then for keeping quiet on the situation, but the focus later shifted to the loss of life and relief efforts."

        "content": "Cyclone Giri was first identified by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) as an area of low pressure over the Bay of Bengal on October\u00a019. Early on October\u00a020, the system was classified as a depression and given the name BOB 04; and at that time, the system was situated roughly 250\u00a0km (155\u00a0mi) southwest of Sittwe, Myanmar.[1] Continued development took place as convection consolidated around the system and banding features formed along the western side of the low. As the depression was situated in an area of weak wind shear, further development was anticipated over the following days.[2] Early on October\u00a021, the IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression and expected it to further intensify into a cyclonic storm within 24\u00a0hours.[3] Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the depression, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 04B. The system rapidly developed throughout the day on October\u00a021, developing an eye embedded within deep convection. In response to a near-equatorial ridge to the south, the system slowly tracked towards the northeast, placing Myanmar within its path.[4] Around 0600\u00a0UTC, the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm, assigning it the name \"Giri\".[5] Tracking over an area of high sea surface temperatures, rapid intensification ensued during the latter half of October\u00a021.[6] Following the development of very intense convection, with estimated cloud top temperatures between \u221270 and \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221294 and \u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F), Giri strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm, having sustained winds of at least 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph 3-minute sustained).[7] Around 1800\u00a0UTC, the JTWC estimated that the system intensified into a Category\u00a01 equivalent cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[8] Early on October\u00a022, Giri further strengthened into a very severe cyclonic storm as it slowly moved towards the central coast of Myanmar.[9] Throughout the day, the storm underwent explosive deepening, attaining winds of 240\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph 1-minute sustained) by 0900\u00a0UTC. Satellite imagery depicted a well-defined 46\u00a0km (29\u00a0mi) wide eye surrounded by deep convection. Accompanied by strong poleward outflow, additional strengthening took place despite Giri's proximity to land.[10] In the hours before landfall on October\u00a022, Giri attained its peak intensity with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph 3-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05\u00a0inHg).[11] However, the JTWC estimated that Giri was a substantially stronger storm, nearly attaining Category\u00a05 status; peak winds were believed to have reached 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph 1-minute sustained) along with an estimated pressure of 922 mbar (hPa; 27.23\u00a0inHg).[12] Around 1400\u00a0UTC, Cyclone Giri made landfall near Hunter's Bay, roughly 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) northwest of Kyaukpyu at peak intensity.[13] Upon doing so, Giri became the most intense storm to ever strike Myanmar, surpassing Cyclone Nargis which struck the Irrawaddy Delta region as a low-end Category\u00a04 equivalent in May 2008.[14] However, according to the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies, substantial weakening had taken place within the hours before landfall; they estimated that Cyclone Giri struck the coastline with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph 1-minute sustained).[15] Once overland, the cyclone rapidly decayed as convection dissipated.[16] By early October\u00a023, only scattered bursts of convection remained around the center of Giri as it degenerated into a tropical depression.[17] The final advisory from the IMD was issued later that day as the system weakened further.[18]"

There were concerns that the cyclone could cause devastation similar to that of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 which killed an estimated 140,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta.[20] The chief of the Myanmar Climate Change Watch, a branch within the Myanmar Meteorology and Hydrology Department, urged people to move to higher grounds and into sturdy buildings as a storm surge up to 3.6\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) was anticipated. Warnings of the storm were constantly broadcast through television, radio and newspapers. In Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, authorities used loudspeakers to warn residents about Cyclone Giri.[21] According to the military junta, an estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm.[22] Even though the storm wasn't expected to hit Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department issued storm signal five, \"danger level\", at ports of Cox's Bazar and Chittagong.[23] Ships and vessels were also asked to return to shore quickly.[24] On October\u00a023, the warning signals were lowered as the threat from Giri diminished.[25]"

Residents stated that most of Kyaukphyu was destroyed by Giri, with nearly every tree and lamppost felled and all structures damaged or destroyed.[27] Later reports confirmed that roughly 70% of the city had been destroyed by Giri.[28] In the Ashey Paing ward, an entire village was flattened by the storm as roughly 1,000 homes were destroyed. Near the Gangawtaw Pagoda in Kyaukphyu, nearly 100 homes were completely destroyed.[27] The local Red Cross office in the city was also destroyed after a large tree fell on it due to high winds.[29] Myebon Township was the hardest-hit area in the country: several villages were completely destroyed by the storm and many others were severely damaged.[30] According to the United Nations, roughly 15,000 homes were destroyed by the storm throughout Rakhine State.[31] In the Seikphyu Township, flood waters up to 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) deep inundated 20 villages after overflow from a dam was released without warning.

It came at the only harvest of the year for Rakhine State. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 16,187\u00a0hectares (40,000\u00a0acres) of rice paddies were destroyed and another 40,468\u00a0hectares (100,000\u00a0acres) were damaged.[33] Within a day of Giri striking Myanmar, three people were reported to have been killed by the storm and tens of thousands of residents were believed to have been left homeless.[27] By October\u00a025, officials in Myanmar stated that the death toll had risen to 50 and at least 30 people in the Pyin Wan Village were missing. Press reports stated that \"The situation here is alarming\", as more bodies were discovered.[34] Offshore, more than 100 fishermen from Myanmar and Bangladesh were reported missing after 21 ships were caught in rough seas produced by the cyclone.[26] By October\u00a029, at least 94 people were confirmed to have been killed by Giri. Of these fatalities, 84 were in Myebon Township (Mray Bon) and 10 in Pauktaw Township.[35][36] However, according to local relief groups, the death toll had risen over 100.[31] By November\u00a02, 157 fatalities had been confirmed as a result of Cyclone Giri. Of these fatalities, 138 were in Myebon Township, 11 in Pauktaw Township, 5 in Minbya Township and 3 in Kyaukpyu Township.[37] According to officials in Kyaukpyu Township, damage from the storm amounted to Ks.2.34\u00a0billion (US$359\u00a0million).[38]"

By the afternoon of October\u00a023, the Red Cross began deploying relief supplies to the affected region; 300 tents and 150 bags of rice were planned to be distributed to Kyaukphyu where at least 5,000 people were left homeless.[39] According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 176,823 people were affected by the storm and 70,795 were left homeless.[40] By October\u00a030, the number affected and homeless had risen to 1.1\u00a0million and roughly 100,000 respectively.[41][42] Red Cross officials also reported that an estimated 60,000 people were in need of assistance throughout Myanmar.[29] Later that day, a relief charity was opened in Rangoon to aid victims of the storm; in short order, the charity had received donations of Ks.10\u00a0million ($10,000\u00a0USD).[43] By October\u00a025, temporary shelter camps set up by relief agencies housed an estimated 5,000 people.[44] By October\u00a026, the Government of the Union of Myanmar had begun distributing 60,000 zinc roof sheets and the Ministry of Forestry provided 200\u00a0tonnes (220\u00a0tons) of timber. Through the end of October, six non-governmental organizations in Myanmar planned to distribute emergency food supplies, such rice, oil, salt and pulses, to 5,000 residents in Kyaukpyu and Myebon. Health supplies were also being distributed at relief camps by UNICEF in the hardest-hit areas. About 500 family kits containing non-food items, such as tarpaulins and mosquito nets, had been distributed by the Myanmar Red Cross Society and another 1,200 were being sent to the area.[40] By the start of November, the government of Myanmar requested medial aid from the United Nations as a cholera outbreak began to unfold. Additional post-storm diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, eye infections and skin diseases became prevalent as well. According to locals, at least six people died as a result of cholera.[45] At least 200 people were infected with dysentery and four were killed by the disease in the towns of Kyaukphyu, Minbya and Myebon. The cause of the outbreak was linked to a lack of clean water.[46]"

However, the junta claims to have informed the public appropriately.[44] Little assistance had reached thousands of survivors days after the storm's passage, fueling anger from local media sources. Government relief slowly reached the area; however, workers only cleared debris left by the storm and only encouraged residents to rebuild by giving them the supplies needed to do so.[28] Further criticism was made about the government withholding information on the loss of life and scale of damage.[49] Requests were also made to postpone a national election for residents in Arakan State;[31] however, no response was given and the elections were still planned to be held on November\u00a07.[41] Additional criticism continued even a week after the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need.[31] Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing what was going on in the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region.[50] On November\u00a08, local media discovered that the junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.[51]"

The third named cyclone of the 2010 cyclone season, Phet developed in the Arabian Sea on May\u00a031 to the west of India. With conducive environmental conditions, the storm intensified to reach peak sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) on June\u00a02, based on analysis by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). On the next day, Phet dropped heavy rainfall while moving across eastern Oman, with a peak of 603\u00a0mm (23.7\u00a0in) in Qurayyat. The rains flooded arid areas and collected into wadis \u2013 normally dry river beds. Thousands of homes were wrecked across Oman. There were 24\u00a0fatalities in the country, and damage was estimated at US$780\u00a0million. After exiting Oman on June\u00a04, Phet turned to the northeast and later to the east while continuing to weaken. The residual thunderstorms spread ahead of the circulation over Pakistan, producing 370\u00a0mm (15\u00a0in) of rainfall at Gwadar. In the city, the storm washed away houses and flooded the port, On June\u00a06, Phet moved ashore the country near Karachi, a city of 16\u00a0million people, where several neighborhoods were flooded and power outages lasted over 12\u00a0hours. Across Pakistan, the storm killed 16\u00a0people and left $81\u00a0million in damage. Phet continued into western India, where it degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area.

        "content": "Toward the end of May 2010, a surge in the monsoon produced widespread convection, or thunderstorms, off the southwest coast of India in the southeastern Arabian Sea. After a low-level circulation became evident on May\u00a030, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a low-pressure area. The low moved northwestward within an area of warm water temperatures of 30 to 32\u00a0\u00b0C (86 to 90\u00a0\u00b0F), moderate wind shear, and an upper-level environment conducive for tropical cyclogenesis,[1] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first noted the system on May\u00a030 as an area of potential development.[2] The circulation became more defined within the building convection, which was amplified by outflow from an anticyclone over the northern Arabian Sea.[3] At 03:00\u00a0Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on May\u00a031, the IMD designated the system as a depression about 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Mumbai, India, or about 1,260\u00a0km (785\u00a0mi) southeast of Muscat, Oman.[1] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 03A.[4] As the wind shear decreased, the convection increased further, and the IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression at 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a01. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm at 09:00\u00a0UTC, naming it Phet.[1] An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance and the development of rainbands showed Phet was intensifying.[5] Late on June\u00a01, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly curved thunderstorm activity.[6] The IMD upgraded Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a02, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm six hours later.[1] With a ridge to the northeast, the cyclone continued slowly northwestward. The JTWC initially expected that Phet would recurve to the northeast without affecting land, reflecting storm model simulations.[7] Lack of observations across the Arabian Sea prevented more the model forecasts from accurately assessing the ridge.[8] Phet quickly intensified on June\u00a02 as it developed a well-defined 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) eye, fueled by outflow that was enhanced by a passing mid-latitude trough.[9] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a02, the IMD estimated peak 3\u00a0minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph).[1] Simultaneously, the JTWC assessed peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph). The agency predicted that Phet would intensify further to reach winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) near the eastern Oman coastline.[9] Drier air from the Arabian Peninsula to the northwest disrupted the storm structure, which caused the eye to become cloud-covered, signaling weakening.[10] Between 00:00\u201302:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a03, Phet made landfall in eastern Oman near Al Ashkharah, with winds between 110\u2013120\u00a0km/h (70\u201375\u00a0mph) according to the IMD.[1] The JTWC assessed landfall as occurring 16\u00a0hours later and with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph).[11] The cyclone became elongated due to increased wind shear while it turned northeastward around the ridge.[12] High mountains in eastern Oman weakened Phet, causing the structure to become more asymmetrical.[13] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a04, the cyclone re-emerged into the Arabian Sea, still presenting banding features and an eye feature but with much less convection.[14] Later that day, the JTWC downgraded Phet to tropical storm status,[15]  and by early on June\u00a05, increased wind shear had displaced the center from the convection.[16] Phet turned eastward once over the Gulf of Oman, weakening to a deep depression by late on June\u00a05.[1] The circulation remained exposed, producing convection well ahead of the center.[17] At 03:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a06, the IMD downgraded Phet further to depression status, assessing that the system made landfall at that intensity 12\u00a0hours later in southern Pakistan near Karachi.[1] The JTWC discontinued advisories once the storm moved ashore.[18] Phet continued generally eastward, crossing the Pakistan/India in Rajasthan. On June\u00a07, the depression weakened into a remnant low near Madhya Pradesh.[1]"

Businesses and schools were shut down in the areas the storm affected,[21] with schools operating as emergency shelters near Muscat.[22] About 85% of the isolated Masirah Island was evacuated;[21] the passage of Phet and subsequent storms affecting the Arabian Peninsula influenced the Omani government's decision to build a fixed link with the island 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) offshore.[23] Nationwide, 12,870\u00a0people evacuated, utilizing 91 government-opened shelters.[1] Omani officials shut down the country's oil and gas production facilities during the storm.[24] In the United Arab Emirates, officials activated rescue teams in the event of rough seas and floods from the storm,[21] and recommended that people stay away from the coast.[25] The President of Pakistan ordered the military and government to take \"immediate precautionary measures\" as the tropical cyclone approached.[26] Hospitals in Karachi, a city of 16\u00a0million people,[27] and coastal areas of Sindh were put on high alert amidst cyclone warnings.[26] Officials advised that fishermen return to port ahead of the cyclone,[28] but more than 450\u00a0fishing boats with up to 6,000\u00a0people were still at sea. This sequence of events spurred a search and rescue mission by the Pakistan Navy that found 150 of them. Many boats sheltered in mangroves along creeks near the coast.[28][29] More than 102,000\u00a0people evacuated ahead of Phet's landfall with the assistance of the Pakistani Armed Forces,[30][31] including 60,000 along the coast in Sindh province.[26] Also in Sindh, 29,135 stayed in government shelters,[32] some of which lacked sufficient food.[33] Others stayed in families' house during the storm,[32] although thousands refused to evacuate at all.[33] Coastal roads were closed to prevent people from nearing the rough seas.[34] Officials directed farmers to shut down their irrigation systems. Non-government organizations and United Nations relief groups went on standby.[31] In Karachi, two ports were shut down and cleared of boats, while thousands of billboards were taken down.[27] Two Emirates flights were postponed due to the storm, and train service from Punjab was delayed.[35] Ahead of the advancing cyclone, over 8,000\u00a0people were evacuated from Kutch district in the Indian state of Gujarat.[36]"

On the mainland, winds reached around 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) at Sur along the eastern coastline, while rainfall peaked at 603\u00a0mm (23.7\u00a0in) in Qurayyat.[19] The heavy rainfall filled and overflowed the newly completed Wadi Dhaiqah Dam,[1] and inundated wadis, which are normally dry river beds.[38] Flash flooding along river banks swept away and killed seven people.[20] Three people trapped by floods had to be rescued by the nation's military, which was deployed to help prepare for the storm.[25] Across Oman, Phet's damage was estimated at over 300\u00a0million rials (US$780\u00a0million).[39] Strong winds knocked down billboards,[21] trees, and power lines, causing power outages.[38] Water pipes and desalination plants were also damaged. Storm flooding washed away hundreds of cars, while also damaging roads and bridges.[39] Nationwide, the cyclone wrecked thousands of homes.[40] On the offshore Masirah Island, Phet's storm surge damaged or wrecked some boats, while strong winds damaged tin roofs and satellite dishes. The roof and compound wall of a resort hotel were damaged. Across eastern and northern Oman, heavy rainfall from Phet flooded low-lying areas and produced landslides. The Royal Oman Police helped direct or traffic after many roads were inundated or blocked. The floodwaters entered homes in Al-Ghubra and Al Athaiba,[38] as well as the Qurum market in Muscat.[41] According to Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence, Phet killed 16\u00a0people in the country,[19] although the IMD reported the death toll at 24.[1] Insurance companies in Oman paid out 77\u00a0million rials (US$200\u00a0million) to policy holders.[40] The Omani Charity Organisation organized a convoy of 22\u00a0trucks, which carried water and food to storm victims, including in and around Muscat.[42] The passage of Phet and subsequent storms led to the Omani government researching into building a fixed link with the offshore Masirah Island.[23] Responding to the floods in Sur, the Omani government hired the Strabag construction company to build a new 1.2\u00a0km (0.75\u00a0mi) earthen dam across Wadi Rafsah.

During the last week of October, the storm detached from the moonsonal trough, and began slowly moving east. On October 29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) both reported that the system had begun to develop, already beginning to organize itself, about 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi), to the southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. During the next few days, the tropical depression strengthened slowly as it slowly moved towards the eastern border of the Indian Ocean. During this time, convection around the disturbance increased, but failed to organize around the storm's low level circulation center. Despite these unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to develop convection around its area of low pressure, and organized itself significantly. On October 31, the Thai and Malaysian meteorological departments (TMD) reported that the disturbance had developed into a tropical depression, and initiated advisories on the system. From October 31 continuing into November 1, the storm strengthened slightly as it continued moving towards the Indian Ocean, but not enough for it to become a tropical storm. Late on November 1, the tropical depression crossed the Malay Peninsula, and entered the extreme eastern part of the Indian Ocean, causing the west Pacific agencies to cancel all their advisories on the storm, as it was no longer in the west Pacific Ocean. As soon as the system entered the extreme eastern border of the Indian Ocean, the India Meteorological Agency (IMD) immediately declared the storm a depression, and began issuing advisories on the system, because the system had already organized itself into a tropical depression in the west Pacific Ocean, on October 31, which was a day before the system entered the IMD's area of responsibility.[5] Later on November 1, the system began showing signs of further, but slow organization, as the system continued moving west slowly.[6] Early on November 2, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD) also issued their first advisory on the system, and the IMD simply called it Depression, because the storm had not yet entered the Bay of Bengal.[7] Later on that day, the IMD reported that the system had weakened into an area of low pressure, due to the effects of crossing the Malay Peninsula, but they forecast it to become a depression soon again, as the storm was moving over warm water.[8] Late on November 3, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system, as it began reorganizing itself.[9] Early on November 4, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) upgraded the area of low pressure to a depression again, this time giving it the designation \"BOB 05\", as the system had now entered the Bay of Bengal.[10] On November 5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 05B.[11] Early on November 6, the IMD upgraded Depression BOB 05 to a deep depression.[12] Later, the deep depression strengthened further, prompting the IMD to upgrade it to a cyclonic storm, and was named \"Jal\".[13] The storm continued to grow and became a severe cyclonic storm by November 6.[14] Soon afterward, it was upgraded to a Category 1 Tropical Cyclone by the JTWC.[15] On November 7, Jal started weakening.[16] Soon afterward, the IMD reported that Jal weakened into a Cyclonic Storm.[17] Later that day, the JTWC downgraded Jal into a Tropical storm.[18] Late on the same day, the IMD reported that the storm weakened into a Deep Depression.[19] As a deep depression, the system made landfall at Chennai, a few hours later.[20] The system continued to weaken and became a depression by early hours of November 8.[21] The depression continued to weaken until it dissipated into a remnant low on the same day.[22] While on that very same day the IMD said that there is a possibility of re-strengthening of Jal's remnants over north east Arabian sea.[23] And as the IMD said, the system moved into the Arabian Sea without weakening by early November 9.[24] But instead of moving across the Arabian Sea, the depression moved north along the western coast of India, restrengthening slightly, but not enough for it to regenerate. Within a few hours, the storm started moving inland, due to the prevailing winds. The system rapidly weakened as it moved farther inland over the next few days, causing severe flooding along the way. Early on November 12, the remnants of Cyclone Jal were completely absorbed by a non-tropical low over the Himalayas."

As a result, heavy to very heavy rains battered the country causing extensive flooding and claimed 59 lives. The government of Thailand estimated the total damage to be around US$1.676 billion.[26] Rail service to the region was partially restored Thursday morning and the airport on Samui island, a popular tourist destination in the Gulf of Thailand, reopened after a temporary shutdown caused by a submerged runway.[27] On the bright side, the research centre predicted the floods would bring seed money back into the economic system as the government would earmark relief funds for flood victims and rehabilitation of the flooded areas.[28] In Hat Yai, many residents were caught off-guard by the flash flood despite evacuation warnings, suggesting either that the cautions were unheard or simply ignored. Urban planning, national irrigation strategies and flood control systems also need a drastic rethink, particularly when one considers the future threat that climate change and rising sea levels will have on Bangkok and other populated coastal areas in the years to come.[29] The Thai community in Brunei has been urged to provide humanitarian relief to the victims of the flood-affected areas back home. Thawat, the Acting Ambassador of Thai Embassy said that the donations can be given in the form of money or goods such as clothing.[30] As the water level in many areas, including Hat Yai district of Songkhla, has receded significantly and Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has already handed out the first lot of 5,000-baht cash aid to flood-affected families in the Northeast as an initial compensation amount from the government, it remains to be seen if families who suffered casualties will receive compensation from the Fund for Disaster Victims as promised.[31] Private citizens were on the forefront, soliciting donations from other members of the public, rushing aid to flood-stricken areas and distributing relief packages to flood victims.[32] The opposition Puea Thai Party on Friday petitioned the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) to take legal action against Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, claiming he acted too slowly to counter the effects from the recent flooding, resulting in massive damage to property and many deaths. The petition filed by Puea Thai spokesman Prompong Nopparit accuses the prime minister of malfeasance in violation of Article 157 of the Criminal Code. Mr Prompong said the prime minister has the administrative power to ensure swift action to prevent and mitigate effects from flooding under Article 4 of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act of 2007, but had not properly exercised his authority.[33] The Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress thanked and expressed his concern toward the flood situation in Thailand, which was the worst flood in 50 years, with 50 provinces affected. The Chinese government intends to provide humanitarian aid and has granted 10 million yuan for the flooded area's restoration.[34]"

Nearly 50,000 people were forced to leave their homes due to rising flood waters. The severity of damage also prompted the closure of an airport and the regions major highway.[2] The floods affected transportation in and around Kedah and Perlis, shutting down rail and closing roads including the North\u2013South Expressway.[36] Alor Setar's Sultan Abdul Halim Airport was also closed after its runway was flooded, leaving helicopters as the only mode of aerial transport into Kedah and Perlis.[37] The floods also contaminated water supply in Kedah and Perlis, forcing the states to receive supplies from the neighbouring state of Perak.[38] Rice production, a key industry in Kedah and Perlis, was badly affected by the floods. According to the federal government, over 45,000 hectares of rice fields were damaged in Kedah alone. The government pledged 26 million ringgit in aid to farmers in both states.[39] In Perlis, the floods submerged over two-thirds of the state's land in water.[40] The north-eastern state of Kelantan was also affected by the floods, causing the closure of some schools.[41] The floods triggered immediate political fallout. The Federal Minister for Housing and Local Government and Alor Setar MP Chor Chee Heung criticised the Kedah State government (led by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, an opponent of Chor's Barisan Nasional coalition) for what he considered a slow response to the floods and the government's inexperience. Chor's own home in Alor Setar was flooded.[42][43] Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin claimed the State government had a responsibility to assist victims of the flood.[44] Kedah's Chief Minister Azizan argued that his government's response had been \"quick\" and that 300,000 ringgit in aid had been committed to the affected areas.[40] Kedah's Sultan Abdul Halim called publicly for politics to be set aside for the purposes of dealing with the floods.[45]"

Storm warning signals were hoisted in Ganjam and Jagatsinghpur districts of Orissa.[46] Over 70,000 people evacuated from four districts of Andhra Pradesh, the authorities provided shelter in relief camps across interior Andhra Pradesh.[47] Five teams of 40\u201350 rescuers arrived at the low lying, already flooded areas in Andhra Pradesh where the impact of the system was expected to be worse.[48] As the cyclone neared landfall, heavy rainfall caused mudslides and flooding. On November 9, The Andhra Pradesh chief minister Konijeti Rosaiah said that about 54 have died in India due to the storm.[1] The National Disaster Response Force at Arakkonam in Tamil Nadu shifted their personnel to Nellore in order to supervise the rescue and relief operations.[49] Over 16 flights scheduled to land at Chennai were diverted to Bangalore because of poor visibility.[50] It was reported that around 300 thousand hectares of cropland was devastated by the cyclone.[51] Power outages occurred at many places in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh throughout Sunday.[52] The Indian government said that they would be giving twenty kilograms of rice and five litres of kerosene to each family in flood-affected areas. They would also give \u20b9 2 lakhs to the families of the victims.[53] The total damage estimated by the Indian government was US$53.55 million with Visakhapatnam district suffering a damage of US$18.53 million, Nellore district suffering a damage of US$22.59 million and Prakasam district suffering a damage of US$12.43 million.[54] Coastal and interior areas of Karnataka too faced heavy rains due to the cyclone. One person was killed in Chennai, Tamil Nadu when a tree toppled.[25] As the remnants of Jal continued to move northwest, they brought light to moderate spells of rain in India's warmest state of Rajasthan. Later on, light to moderate spells of rain also battered the state of Gujarat.[55]"

At least 12 people were killed in the Czech Republic[1] and one in Poland[citation needed]. The floods were the worst natural disaster in the Czech Republic since floods in 2002, which had killed 17 people and caused billions of dollars of damage in Prague.[2] Those same floodwaters from the Czech Republic also affected Germany, with Dresden being hit by its worst flooding for over a century and three thousand people evacuated from areas where water was said to be waist-deep.[3] Austria also experienced its heaviest rainfalls in half a century.[2]"

        "content": "June 2009 was one of the rainiest months of June for Austria since weather records have been kept.[4][5]  After a very dry April,[6] May had already been wet,[7] and in the middle of June, low pressure areas and thunderstorms followed.  Quinton Low[8] ensured strong rainfall in the Eastern Alps, the southern Carpathians, and from the middle of the Balkan Peninsula to the Crimea and Baltic Sea regions between 20 and 30 June. It moved slowly over the Adriatic Sea toward the Black Sea forming an upper low \u2013 despite the typical muggy movement from the southeast and build-up of precipitation from the east and northeast, a classic flood situation that was missing the Genoa low of a ground low core. The Quinton Low formed from 20 to 22 June, through constriction of an upper low over the Alps towards the southeast.  An Atlantic infusion of cold air had brought heavy precipitation[9][10] with snowfall down to elevations of 1500m.  The separated upper low shifted over the mid-Adriatic on 20 and 21 June[11] and the central Balkans on 22 June.[12][13]  Its front system, which was occluded from the east and then was guided to the northeast towards Central Europe, drove from 22 to 24 June[14][15][16][17] from the Lower Inn Valley to the Vienna Basin with heavy precipitation of over 100mm/48h, with 207mm/48h in Lunz am See.  Locally, this phase was similar to the 2005 European floods, although in that year there was a faster rise.[8] Starting on 25 June, the low moved over the Black Sea.  On 25 and 26 June,[18] the precipitation was concentrated in the area around Belgrade and Southern Hungary.  In Austria and the Czech Republic, the situation eased.  On 27 and 28 June,[19][20] a front moved towards Southern Poland and the Baltic states, and further precipitation-heavy air masses once again struck the Czech Republic, Austria, and Serbia, as well as Central Bulgaria and Moldova on 29 June.[21][22] The stable and stationary weather situation did not disintegrate until after 29 June. However, the air mass over Central and Eastern Europe remained extremely moist and unstable such that heavy thunderstorms repeatedly drove further local floods in the following days.  Local areas of heavy rain of up to 50mm in a few hours were recorded across Central Europe until the first two weeks of July.  The end of the weather phase did not occur until the passing of the low Rainer over England and the North Sea[23][24] and low Steffen over Southern Scandinavia,[25][26] which the slowly advancing weather system surrounded from 3 to 9 July."

        "content": "On Tuesday 23 June, the strong rise began to impact the tributaries that lead from the south to the Danube, and flood warnings were triggered on the night of 24 June in many places in the Upper and Lower Austrian Prealps.[27]  The state warning centers were reinforced.  By the morning of 24 June, about 4,000 firefighters were already operating in Upper Austria and Lower Austria.  Armed Forces helicopters were also in use. In Upper Austria, the Krems and Traun rivers partially came together at the banks.  The level of the tributaries was rising while the Danube was steady.  Seven districts in Lower Austria were already affected.  The rivers Ybbs, Melk, Erlauf, Traisen, and Perschling were especially flooded.  Ybbsitz had been closed off from the outside world since 3AM.[28]  At the Danube (Strudengau, Wachau), the available mobile flood prevention equipment was assembled as much as possible.  In Styria, only individual actions were reported, mainly pumping operations but also elimination of mudslides. By 25 June, the persistent rainfall was over.  Instead, increasingly short heavy rains with large masses of water were recorded.  Since the ground was no longer receptive to water, the aftereffects of these precipitations were similarly devastating.  In Upper Austria, the situation calmed because the level of the tributaries was slowly falling towards normal levels.  In Steyr, the level had sunk to the quay, 1.4m less than the previous day.  The Danube had reached its highest level of 6.9m overnight in Mauthausen and also sank slowly.  The center of the flood shifted towards Wachau as the precipitation itself moved towards the east.  253 of the 326 fire departments in Burgenland were called on for flood operations within 24 hours.[29] The Albertina Museum in Vienna evacuated 950,000 artworks by artists such as Monet and Renoir.[2] On 26 June further floods affected areas stretching from Mostviertel to Burgenland, particularly in the G\u00fcssing District where whole tracts of land were under up to a meter of water, while Strem was surrounded by masses of water.[28]  The Armed Forces assisted the fire departments with 200 men.  In the Lower Austrian Klingfurth near Wiener Neustadt, homes threatened by a landslide had to be evacuated.  The Adria-Wien Pipeline, which lies in the affected hillside, had to be turned off for security reasons.  In Styria, in which about 400 landslides were recorded since the beginning of the storm, the situation calmed a bit as the day turned to evening.[30] On Saturday 27 June, two dams of the Leitha river in Bruck an der Leitha District were broken open, allowing water to flow into an uninhabited area so as to relieve the river.[31]  On Sunday night, a fatality was reported.[32] Further installments of rain were encountered after the weekend.  The assistance of the Armed Forces concentrated on the areas around Feldbach District and F\u00fcrstenfeld District.  Upper Styria was also increasingly affected.  The village of Radmer was without power and completely inaccessible after heavy mudslides.  Floods and obstructions also surrounded Mariazell and Hieflau.  The situation at the Enns intensified again. On the afternoon of Monday 29 June the level of the Steyr was again over 4m.  Wachau also went into another flood warning.[28] On the night of 30 June the Alpine railway station was flooded for the second time in the span of a few days[33] after the strongest-ever measured rainfall in St. P\u00f6lten.  The \u00d6BB again closed down the operation of the Mariazellerbahn.[34] On Tuesday, further landslides were able to be stopped with the help of Czech hedgehogs.  Nevertheless, numerous buildings could still not be cleared as habitable.  Due to scattered storms in Graz-Umgebung District, there were also frequent lightning strikes.[35] On Friday 3 July Wachau was affected by the storm for the second time within two weeks.  Spitz, which had been previously flooded by the Danube, was flooded this time by the usually only 30\u00a0cm deep Spitzerbach, which swelled to 4m after thunderstorms.[36]  An 81-year-old man who was swept away was not found until 12 July in the Danube.[37]  Also, in Waldviertel and Steyr-Land District, severe thunderstorms occurred with heavy precipitation, which again required the use of over 2,000 firefighters.[38] On Monday 6 July the strongest rainfall in 200 years began in the afternoon hours.  Parts of Lower Austria, Vienna, and Northern Burgenland were especially affected.[39] St. P\u00f6lten was again declared a disaster area, as large parts of the metropolitan area were flooded.[40] The Nadelbach flooded the cadastral communities Nadelbach and Hafing.  The surroundings of the Alpine Railway Station were yet again under water.  Areas that had never before had to suffer through flooding were also unexpectedly under water on 6 July. Europaplatz and Schie\u00dfstadtring in St. P\u00f6lten had to be closed off; a 7m-wide stream had carved itself out leading from the Alpine Railway Station to the center of the city.  The regional court and the prison were also threatened by high water.[41] A further danger existed at the EVN Group substation as the water level had almost brought power production to a halt.  The B1a tunnel under the government Landhaus district was blocked due to the flood.  The Western Railway had to be closed down for two hours in the evening.[39] Additional problems arose due to the rise of the groundwater level associated with the flooding, which also reached a historical peak.[42] Severe weather warnings were issued on Thursday 7 July that were similar in scope to the days before.  This time however, the storm affected the Upper Austrian area more, where especially extensive damage had been done by hail in agricultural areas in Gmunden, V\u00f6cklabruck, and Wels.[43] In D\u00fcrnstein in Wachau, there were rockslides at Vogelbergsteig, which blocked both the Danube Highway and the Danube Railway.[44] The B3 became once again freely passable on 10 July, after explosions that removed loose rock from the wall.  However, the Danube Railway required longer repair work.[45] On 10 July the situation in Styria again took a turn for the worse.  There was further rainfall, especially in Feldbach District.[46]  There were about 600 landslides in Styria around this timeframe."

Since disaster management in Austria takes place mainly at the federal state level, figures for all of Austria are not readily available.  Countrywide figures were only released for the Armed Forces.  137,000 relief hours were worked in the assistance operation from 23 June to 9 July.  On average, about 700 soldiers were deployed at any time countrywide.[53] 311,000 relief hours were worked by firefighters and disaster assistance services in the largest federal state Lower Austria alone.[54]  The Austrian Red Cross also helped with many volunteers and crisis intervention teams.  Likewise, Team Austria volunteers were put to work in the relief effort.[55] The fact that at the beginning of August in Lower Austria alone twelve streets and three railways were obstructed shows how extensive the infrastructure damage was.

A flood warning was issued for the South Bohemian Region.  The highest level was reached in the rivers Mal\u0161e, Blatnice, and \u010cern\u00e1.  \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice was also affected by the warning.[57]  In the evening, the Ro\u017enovsk\u00e1 Be\u010dva rose about 1.2m in Vala\u0161sk\u00e9 Mezi\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed and its water level at the estuary in the Be\u010dva rose to ten times normal.

The floods in North Moravia and Silesia took on a different character.  In the span of two hours on 24 June, strong rainfall brought flash floods with up to 80L/m2 of rain at the streams Ji\u010d\u00ednka and Zrz\u00e1vka.  The level of the Ji\u010d\u00ednka swelled to 5.5m and thereby exceeded the 1997 Central European flood by 2m.  In Jesen\u00edk nad Odrou, the brook Luha rose to 2m in the span of a half-hour; four people died in that community, three by drowning.  People also died in Nov\u00fd Ji\u010d\u00edn, Bernartice nad Odrou, \u017divotice u Nov\u00e9ho Ji\u010d\u00edna, and Kun\u00edn.  The floods also created extensive damage in districts of Nov\u00fd Ji\u010d\u00edn such as Bludovice, \u017dilina, Hodslavice, and Mo\u0159kov. Other rivers temporarily rose over their banks after strong local rainfall.  In Bohemian Switzerland, the Kamenice flooded parts of Jansk\u00e1 on the evening of 1 July.[58]  On 6 July sudden thunderstorms hit \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region, where a state of emergency had to be called in some places.  West and South Bohemia were also severely threatened in places like T\u00e1bor.  The authorities feared a burst of dams of artificial lakes and considered evacuating the affected villages.[59] Parts of West and South Bohemia as well as Central Moravia were also greatly affected by the flood.  In the region, dams of a series of artificially created lakes threatened to break.  The authorities considered the evacuation of more villages on Tuesday night. Overall, fourteen people died in the Czech Republic due to the impact of the flooding.[60] The Olomouc Region and the Moravian-Silesian Region were particularly affected in the drainage basins of the Oder and the Morava where numerous streets and rail lines were disrupted.[61] In the first estimates, the total damage was estimated to be 5-6 billion Czech koruna (about \u20ac230,000,000).[62] Hepatitis vaccinations were commenced for children in severely affected areas in order to prevent an outbreak of the disease.[63] On 24 July the lowest flood warning level was lifted in Nov\u00fd Ji\u010d\u00edn Region.[64] Criticism of the speed of response by firefighters and municipalities was prevalent, as citizens were not informed about impending floods.  The Environmental Minister Ladislav Miko confirmed that the meteorological internet server broke down at a critical time.[65]"

Alt\u00f6tting, Berchtesgadener Land, Cham, and particularly Traunstein were affected by the flooding owing to rising tributaries.[67] On Thursday night, 25 June, the level of the Danube rose in Passau, such that the warning level reached 3 (definition: individual built-up properties or basements are flooded, blocking of local transport channels, or isolated use of water or dam defense is required).  On Thursday, the flooding of the Danube and the Isar moved the warning level to 2 (definition: agriculture and forestry land is flooded or light traffic delays on main traffic roads and local roads).

This was about 30\u00a0cm higher than in a large flood in 1965.  Due to the temporary expansion of flood protection and because the high water level did not persist, there was no expected risk.  The Hungarian Western Railway still had to close down operation between Szentgotth\u00e1rd and Jennersdorf because the rails were undermined in numerous places.  In Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom County, the first flood warning level was called.  The Leitha in Hungarian territory was not affected. On 26 June a cautious all-clear was announced for the Danube between Esztergom and Budapest because the water levels remained lower than had been feared.  The peak was expected on the night of 27 June into the 28th and was estimated to be 40\u201350\u00a0cm deeper than in the devastating floods of 2006.  Nevertheless, precautions were taken in numerous important locations, such as Szentendre Island. On the morning of Sunday 28 June the Danube reached its high point, which was 25% less than the floods in 2006.  Flood warnings were in effect for a stretch of 528 kilometers of the Danube in Hungary.  In Nagymaros, the level rose 5.33m, while the level in Budapest rose 6.96m.  The increase had been expected to be 7.04m for a short time.  In the upper Danube areas, the level sank noticeably around this time.  In Budapest alone, the floods led to the blockage of the two quays.[69] On 2 July there were alerts along 853 kilometers. 36 kilometers of third degree alerts near the river Lajta, second degree on the Danube at Dunakiliti, Gy\u0151r, Kom\u00e1rom, Esztergom, Budapest and on the river R\u00e1ba at S\u00e1rv\u00e1r, first degree alerts from the Ipoly river mouth to the southern border of Hungary.[70]"

It also broke the record for the most snow in Yarmouth with 82.0 centimetres (32.3\u00a0in) of snow, surpassing the 67.8 centimetres (26.7\u00a0in) that fell on January 16, 1977. Charlottetown PEI also broke their all time daily snowfall record with 74.4 centimetres (29.3\u00a0in). Numerous unofficial reports[example  needed] placed a snowfall of nearly 150 centimetres (59\u00a0in) in many regions across the province. The storm also produced sustained winds ranging from 60 to 80\u00a0km/h through much of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador with maximum 1 minute gusts of 120 kilometres (75\u00a0mi) per hour reported at many stations. Much of central, northern and western New Brunswick received little to no snow or wind as the storm tracked toward the east. Two weather stations in the Halifax Regional Municipality reported 10-second gusts nearing 147 kilometres per hour (91\u00a0mph). However, these reports have never been confirmed by Environment Canada. Weather radar observations, as well as synoptic report, showed extensive thundersnow embedded within the blizzard; in the heaviest bands, accumulation rates exceeded 20 centimetres per hour (7.9\u00a0in/h). The wind combined with the intense snow rates produced visibilities of 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) or less in most areas for brief periods, however these conditions persisted for at least eight hours in much of Nova Scotia. The wind also whipped up snow drifts which in some cases covered two and three-storey buildings and made many roads impassable to both common motor vehicles and snow removal equipment. The humid continental climate of coastal Nova Scotia typically does not experience extreme snowfalls, compared with northern Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. Thus the blizzard and heavy snowfall had a crippling effect on the Halifax Urban Area for several days following the storm as public works personnel struggled to clear streets and roads.  For several nights following the storm, a 10 p.m. curfew was implemented on residents in the Halifax Regional Municipality to permit operation of snow removal equipment. Due to a lack of space to displace the excess snow, the municipality had to receive permission from the federal government to begin dumping the snow into Halifax Harbour from federally owned docks in addition to the usual privately owned docks. The storm also had an effect on the 2004 Special Olympic National Winter Games, which were being held in Charlottetown, PEI."

The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and assigned it the name Maysak. According to the JMA, Maysak became the second typhoon of the year on March\u00a028. The typhoon underwent explosive intensification into a Category\u00a05 super typhoon on March\u00a031, passing near the islands of Chuuk and Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia. After maintaining that intensity for 18 hours, Maysak weakened, made landfall over the Philippine island of Luzon as a minimal tropical storm, and dissipated shortly afterwards. Maysak affected Yap and Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia, as well as the Philippines. The storm was responsible for four deaths in the Federated States of Micronesia alongside 10\u00a0injuries. Damage was estimated at $8.5\u00a0million (2015\u00a0USD). Estimates from the Red Cross suggested that there were 5,000\u00a0people in desperate need of food, water and shelter, and needed emergency assistance.

        "content": "An area of convection persisted on March\u00a024 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially, it consisted of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development.[4] It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center.[5] On March\u00a026, the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression just east of Pohnpei.[6] On March\u00a027, the JTWC started tracking the system as a Tropical Depression 04W.[7] Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day,[8] and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.[9] On March\u00a028, microwave satellite imagery revealed an eye with central dense overcast obscuring most of the feature;[10] accordingly, the JMA upgraded Maysak to a severe tropical storm.[6] The storm continued to strengthen while moving westward along the periphery of a subtropical ridge,[10] The eye became more defined and the convection became more consolidated.[11] Early on March\u00a029, the JMA upgraded Maysak further to typhoon status, estimating 10\u00a0minute winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[6] That day, the typhoon moved over Chuuk Lagoon, the first time an eye crossed the lagoon since Typhoon Amy in 1971.[12][13] The storm developed good outflow, enhanced by a strong northerly flow,[14] although moderate wind shear kept Maysak from intensifying more quickly.[15] However, the eye became clearly visible on March\u00a030,[16] and the typhoon rapidly intensified after the shear diminished.[17] The JTWC reported a 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) wide eye displaying the stadium effect, and surrounded by very deep convection. On March\u00a031, the agency assessed that Maysak intensified into a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon on the SSHWS, with 1-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph); this was increased to 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph) in post-season reanalysis, the highest on record for a pre-April typhoon.[18] Around that time, the storm was moving through the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), passing just north of Fais Island,[19] and also very near Ulithi.[18] Late on March\u00a031, Maysak reached its peak intensity, and the JMA estimated peak winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 910\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg),[6] although operationally, the agency had estimated that Maysak was slightly more intense.[20] This made Maysak the most powerful typhoon ever recorded before April, surpassing Typhoon Mitag of 2002, Typhoon Alice of 1979, and Typhoon Harriet of 1959.[18] At peak intensity, Maysak had a nearly symmetric eye with an almost perfect ring of convection around it, with characteristics of an annular tropical cyclone.[21] On April\u00a01, the eye widened to about 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) after undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle,[22] and the storm began to weaken,[6] with diminished intensity of the convection.[23] The convection weakened significant in the storm's southern quadrant due to drier air and worsening upper-level conditions.[24] On April\u00a01, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started tracking Maysak, giving it the local name Chedeng.[25] The eye widened further as dry air wrapped into the center,[26] and stronger wind shear diminished the convection.[27] On April\u00a04, the JMA downgraded Maysak to a severe tropical storm, and later that day further to a tropical storm.[6] The storm continued to weaken as it approached the Philippines, and late on April\u00a04, the storm's the convection began dislocating from the circulation.[28] On April\u00a05, Maysak made landfall along east-central Luzon as a minimal tropical storm,[6] making it one of only eight storms to strike the island between January and April since 1945.[29] Soon after it degraded into a tropical depression,[6] and the weakening storm crossed Luzon with scattered thunderstorms.[30] After emerging into the South China Sea, the system continued to the west-northwest, and Maysak dissipated on April\u00a07.[6]"

Agricultural impact was extensive, with 90\u00a0percent of the banana, breadfruit, and taro crops destroyed in Chuuk and Yap states. Overall, 281\u00a0homes were destroyed, and another 300 were damaged.

There were four deaths and ten injuries related to the typhoon in the FSM.[31] Early in its development, Maysak brushed Kosrae within the FSM. Persistent westerly winds knocked down a few trees and damaged a few houses while also causing beach erosion.[32] The storm later struck Chuuk State on March\u00a029, passing directly over the main island as a Category\u00a01-equivalent typhoon,[12] with gusts as high as 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph).[32] Rainfall on Weno Island reached 150 to 180\u00a0mm (6 to 7\u00a0in).[33] High sustained winds, measured up to 114\u00a0km/h (71\u00a0mph) at the local National Weather Service office, downed numerous trees, power lines, and tore off roofs.[12] An estimated 80\u201390\u00a0percent of homes in Chuuk sustained damage.[12] The storm destroyed at least 830\u00a0homes and 37\u00a0businesses, displacing 6,760\u00a0people. Power to most of the state, including the entirety of Weno, was knocked out and communication was difficult.[34] On Weno alone, the storm left about 7,000\u00a0people homeless.[35] Water sources were rendered undrinkable.[36] Outlying islands sustained heavy damage to crops and houses. Across Chuuk State, rough waves from the typhoon damaged seawalls and sank or damaged 11\u00a0boats or ships. There were at least four deaths in the state.

One person died due to a mudslide, and a newborn child died after being unable to arrive at the hospital due to fallen trees.[33] Two days after striking Chuuk, Maysak passed directly over Ulithi atoll and skirted Fais Island at peak intensity, resulting in extensive damage.[34][36] According to Guam Governor Eddie Calvo, sustained winds reached 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) in Ulithi and 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) on Fais,[37] with gusts reaching 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) on Ulithi.[32] All structures on Ulithi not made of concrete were severely damaged or destroyed by Maysak's powerful winds.[38] Power and water supplies to Ulithi were completely lost during the storm.[39] The entirety of the island's crop were ruined by the typhoon's storm surge, with early estimates indicating that it would be a full year before crops could be planted again.[37] Though spared a direct hit, Yap proper was also hit hard with reports of airborne debris during the storm.[36] Outlying islands were also affected; on Faraulep, water wells were contaminated and fruit trees were knocked down.[33] During the storm, 18\u00a0fishermen were stranded Pikolot Island and West Fayew Island, but they returned home afterward.[40]"

        "content": "Ahead of the storm, over 24,000\u00a0people evacuated Philippines's northeastern province of Aurora.[41] Many radio stations, typically which close during Easter, remained operational to broadcast the storm. Officials issued storm warnings, and the military was on alert.[42] Beaches were closed, boats were ordered to remain at port, and 10\u00a0flights were canceled.[43] The Department of Social Welfare and Development reported that \u20b1300.9\u00a0million (US$6.8\u00a0million) worth of funds and supplies were available for possible relief efforts. Approximately 28,000\u00a0family food packs were prepositioned in warehouses across Luzon.[44] Striking the Philippines as a rapidly weakening system, Maysak had only minimal effects in the country,[44] producing strong waves and light rainfall.[42] Across Aurora and Isabela provinces, a total of 2,761\u00a0people were directly affected by the storm, most of whom were evacuated prior to Maysak's landfall. No damage or loss of life was reported; however, four people were injured after waves generated by Maysak hit them while they were taking selfies along the shoreline of Dipaculao town in Aurora province on April\u00a04.[44][45] An overloaded, unregistered ferry capsized off Sulu Province in Mindanao on April\u00a03, resulting in five deaths. The Philippine Coast Guard stated that seas at the time were calm and the sinking likely resulted from overcrowding of the vessel rather than Typhoon Maysak.[46]"

        "content": "Chuuk Governor Johnson Elimo issued a state of emergency on April\u00a01 and stated that international assistance was necessary. Immediate concerns included the possibility of residents starving with most of the state's crops ruined.[36] Yap Governor Tony Ganngiyan also issued a state of emergency on April\u00a01.[47] On April\u00a09, the Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia held a special two-day session at the request of President Manny Mori, which included determination of typhoon relief funds. They allocated $1.5\u00a0million toward relief for Chuuk and Yap States on April\u00a011.[48] The president also issued a price freeze to pre-storm levels to prevent price gouging.[35] The FSM government estimated that residents on Fais and Ulithi would need food rations for 3\u20136 months following the typhoon.[39] Debris removal at Chuuk International Airport allowed for flights to the state to resume on April\u00a01.[37] Emergency assistance across the nation was hampered by the remote and small nature of the islands it comprises. In many instances, communities can only be reached by boat. Further complicating issues was the large number of trees uprooted or downed by the storm which blocked numerous roads.[49] Generators had been supplied to Ulithi and Fais by April\u00a06, allowing for water pumps to be activated and supply clean water.[39] Power and water supply was gradually restored, although many remained without power by two weeks after the storm.[35] On April\u00a06, a United States Coast Guard helicopter provided an aerial assessment of the islands affected.[39] Damage assessment was difficult due to the many sparse islands affected across open ocean.[50] Relief supplies stockpiled by the Micronesian Red Cross were distributed in the immediate aftermath of Maysak; however, these supplies were exhausted by April\u00a08.[49] On April\u00a014, the FSM government sent a patrol boat to Chuuk, delivering rice, ramen noodles, and water.[51] Due to their Compact of Free Association, United States President Barack Obama declared a state of disaster for the FSM on April\u00a028, which allocated federal assistance for rebuilding.[52] This followed a request by FSM President Mori on the previous day.[53] USAID transported relief goods and $2.1\u00a0million worth of aid, including reverse osmosis kits and water distribution tanks. On Ulithi, the USAID delivered 20,000\u00a0kg (44,000\u00a0lb) worth of food to residents. Throughout the FSM, the agency assisted in repairing buildings, providing housing assistance to residents whose homes were destroyed,[51] as well as plastic sheeting. By May\u00a08, the United States government had provided nearly $2.96\u00a0million in assistance, including $620,000 sent to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for regrowing damaged crops.[47] Several countries, agencies, and non-governmental organizations came to the aid of the FSM in the wake of Maysak.[31] On April\u00a013, the Government of Australia provided A$100,000 (US$77,000) and two patrol boats for recovery and relief operations.[54] As an offer of \"comfort and support\", the Chinese government gave the FSM $500,000 in cash on April\u00a021.[55] The Government of Japan sent water treatment and transportation supplies to the FSM government, while the International Organization for Migration distributed 20\u00a0water treatment units to Ulithi.[47] The European Union also sent 47\u00a0rainwater storage units, which would aid in helping future water supply.[56]"

These created a wind convergence zone in the east coast of Sumatra Island, and in North Sumatra's Barisan Mountains.[1][2][3] On circa 20:00 WIB, 3 December 2020, rain begin hitting parts of the city of Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia.[4] No severe occurrences were recorded, until a levee[5] in Belawan River[6] and several other rivers like the Deli River and Denai River broke,[7] and waters started rushing, causing much of the flood.[5] An hour later,[6] floods started hitting several places, going as deep as 15-60 centimeters, categorizable as a flash flood. Transport mobility quickly exacerbated, and traffic jams were observed. In some places, the flood entered houses. The Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) predicted mild rain in several areas in Medan. It also issued a warning on the probability of floods and landslides, worsened by strong winds, in the east and western area of the city.[4] By this point, evacuation had commenced.[8] By 04:00 the following day, the Deli River rushed so strong that houses were damaged in an instant,[9] also overflowing the Binjai and Mencirim Rivers in the neighboring city Binjai.[10] By 08:00, the flood got deeper, most significantly in the Lalang Village. It is the first major flood in the area since 2013. As floods hit the roads, traffic becomes more congested, most concerningly disadvantaging food delivery drivers.[11] Some vehicles also drowned.[12] In some areas, floods measured at up to two meters reached the roofs of houses.[13][14] Later, the Medan-Binjai Toll Road was flooded.[15] The intensity of the rain reduced at around 16:30,[16] and by 22:30 the remaining inundations range from 30 to 60 centimeters.[17] The website FloodList reported that areas around Southeast Asia also saw heavy rain. In Prabumulih, South Sumatra floods on 3 December impacted 180 houses. Another set of floods impacted 23 districts in the North Aceh and Bener Meriah Regencies on 4 December, causing landslides in two districts with one death and 13,675 households affected. Rain was also scattered across Java, causing floods in the Banyumas Regency and landslides in the Garut Regency on 3 December, causing three injuries, 20 property damages, 500 residents evacuated, and \"205 families affected\". In Malaysia, flooding occurred from 3 to 6 December, and by 5 December affected 1,566 people in the state of Terengganu, 145 in Pahang, 27 in Perak and 369 in Kelantan; the following day, 194 people which made up 52 families were affected.[18]"

Not long later, a 20-year-old male wearing \"yellow jacket and jeans\" named Heka was found at the Griya Nusa III Tanjung Selamat residence, Medan Tuntungan; a female was nearby his body when discovered, whilst crying of grievance.[24] In addition to property damage, a suspension bridge in Aloha Village nearly broke due to the water rushing.[25] By 16:30, during which the rain had subsided, five of the six missing people have been found dead; they comprise one child, three females, and one male died.[12] With floodwaters reaching up to five meters, 181 people were rescued.[20] An hour later, the sixth person was found dead. Two of the dead was found washed by the Deli River. However it was theorized that the death toll likely more than six.[26] This was proven correct when The Jakarta Post reported the deaths increasing to eight.[1] Impacted administrative districts were Medan Johor, Maimun, Sunggal, Tuntungan, and Polonia. 12,783 people and 4,249 families were reportedly affected.[14][27] In Binjai, at five sub-districts comprising 16 urban villages, thousands of homes were reportedly destroyed.[10] As of 6 December, accounting the entirety of North Sumatra, more than 31,100 people were affected, as well as 48,000 in Aceh.[28] By 8 December, the count in Aceh rose to 86,724, with 18 damaged houses and four damaged infrastructure.[29] Medan mayor candidate Bobby Nasution observes several impacted sites and offers lunch for the victims.[30] Meanwhile, incumbent Edy Rahmayadi announced humanitarian aids to the victims presented by Lions Club, Grab, Gojek, dan Relawan Sumut Bermartabat.[31] The Gelora Party made a chain of soup kitchens called \"Dapur Berkah Gelora,\" which translates to \"Gelora Glorious Kitchen,\" which operated for 24 hours in feeding the poor victims. The response from the party was well received by the locals.[32] To prevent future accidents from happening, locals built an emergency dam made from sand wrapped with sacks of plant fibers, placed in areas of rivers untouched by the flood.[25] Online, #prayformedan became trending for a short while.[7] The Ministry of Social Affairs provided financial aid to inheritance of Rp. 15 million to the families of the dead, several evacuee tents with insulation and ventilation to protect refugees from the COVID-19 virus, as well as additional soup kitchens guarded by 31 disaster management cadets.[33]"

The second named storm of the season, Bella originated in the middle of January 1991 from a surge in the monsoon trough to the southwest of Sumatra. For several days, the system remained weak as it moved generally west-southwestward. On January\u00a025, it intensified to tropical storm status, but Bella took three more days to intensify to tropical cyclone status, with 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0kilometres per hour (75\u00a0miles per hour). The cyclone attained peak intensity on January\u00a029, officially reaching winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center unofficially estimated winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), the highest the agency estimated for any storm in the Southern Hemisphere in the year. Bella later turned to the southeast and weakened, passing about 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) west of Rodrigues on January\u00a031. The storm turned to the south-southwest and back to the southeast again, becoming extratropical on February\u00a04. While passing near Rodrigues, Bella produced strong winds and high tides, the latter of which caused flooding in the capital Port Mathurin. The storm was considered the worst on the island in 20\u00a0years. About 1,500\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving 1,000\u00a0people homeless. Bella also severely damaged crops, roads, and the power grid on Rodrigues. The storm killed about half of the Rodrigues flying fox, a critically endangered species. Elsewhere, Bella was believed to have sunk a Madagascar cargo ship, with its 36\u00a0people on board."

        "content": "Similar to Cyclone Alison that had formed in early January 1991, a surge in the monsoon trough spawned what would become Tropical Cyclone Bella, associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone.[1][2] On January\u00a013, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 1] began monitoring a system about 660\u00a0km (410\u00a0mi) southwest of Padang, Sumatra in the Australian basin. Moving to the west-southwest, the system crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on January\u00a017, and the next day was tracked by the M\u00e9t\u00e9o France office in R\u00e9union (MFR).[nb 2] On January\u00a020, the disturbance turned sharply to the south-southeast, although its westward motion resumed late the following day,[5] influenced by a ridge to the south.[1] On January\u00a022, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression.[5] The JTWC upgraded the storm to tropical storm status on January\u00a023, three days after classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 08S.[6][5] On January\u00a025, the MFR upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bella, a week after beginning to issue advisories. Around that time, the storm became visible on MFR satellite imagery.[5][2] Following a lengthy period of minimal development, Bella subsequently intensified at a more regular rate as it slowed its forward motion. On January\u00a026, it turned more to the southwest, but the westward track resumed on the next day.[5] Aided by warm sea surface temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F), Bella began to intensify quickly.[2] On January\u00a028, both the JTWC and the MFR upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph); this made Bella a tropical cyclone, the first of the season.[5] Around this time, the storm developed a well-defined eye 60\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) in diameter.[2] After becoming a tropical cyclone, Bella continued to intensify, reaching peak winds on January\u00a029. The MFR estimated 10\u00a0minute winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph), and assessed a barometric pressure of 936\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg) at that time. Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated 1\u00a0minute peak winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph);[5] this strength, equivalent to a super typhoon, was the highest the JTWC estimated for any Southern Hemisphere storm during the tropical cyclone year.[6] On January\u00a030, Bella turned to the southeast and began weakening,[5] affected by wind shear in the region.[1] The cyclone passed about 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) west of Rodrigues at 03:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a031,[2] with 10\u00a0minute winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). Shortly thereafter, the cyclone deteriorated into a tropical storm. The southeast trajectory was short-lived, as Bella turned more to the south-southwest on February\u00a01.[5]  After a final turn to the southeast, Bella became an extratropical cyclone on February\u00a04.[2]"

The storm damaged about 75% of the electrical network was damaged, which also disrupted water supply on the island, and about 30% of roads were damaged.[2] Over 90% of the crops on the island were destroyed,[2] with many livestock killed.[8] Cyclone Bella killed about half of the Rodrigues flying fox, a critically endangered species, decreasing the numbers from around 800 to around 400. The species had regrown from a minimum of around 70 in 1971, and the trend toward regrowth continued after the storm, reaching about 3,500 in 2002. The storm also affected the Rodrigues warbler.[9] The storm also injured nine people,[2] and overall, Bella was considered the worst storm on the island in 20\u00a0years.[10] A 16,570\u00a0ton cargo ship traveling from Madagascar to R\u00e9union was lost on January\u00a030 about 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) to the south of the center of Bella. The ship likely sank due to the cyclone, with 36\u00a0people on board.[2] In the aftermath of the storm, seven people contracted Typhoid fever on Rodrigues in relation to the storm.[2] After Bella passed, the government of Mauritius noted the need for 4,500\u00a0m (15,000\u00a0ft) of galvanized pipes to assist in rebuilding, as well as generators.[8] The United States Agency for International Development donated $25,000 (1991\u00a0USD) to Mauritius to help in the aftermath.

For almost a month the area remained flooded and then the waters claimed their very first victims.[4] The southern parts of the nation were in bigger trouble as a tropical depression that was to become Cyclone Jal hit the country, increasing the impact of floods by packing strong winds of about 50 kilometres per hour (31\u00a0mph) with it.[5] Many areas were flooded with water up to 50 centimetres (20\u00a0in) deep.[6] The local government announced that they would be giving 5,000 baht to each household affected by flooding and up to 100,000 baht would be spent for repairs.[7] As floodwaters in the north receded, floods in the south worsened and as a result, many patients were evacuated from the hospitals in northern Thailand and new patients were brought from southern Thailand where the conditions were much worse.[8] Due to severe flooding caused by the tropical depression, power supplies were disrupted, causing blackouts. As a result, one person died.[9] Thousands of Thai citizens were stranded as the floods devastated their homes and washed out towns.[10] At that time, the worst fear was the decline in the national rubber export.[11] All banks in the region have been closed.[12] As fears of a decrease in rubber exports increased, prices of rubber were lowered.[13] A few days later, the rubber factory regained its profit as the yield turned out to be better.[14] Meanwhile, the death toll in the nation rose to 104 as much of the country was flooded and there were not many places to evacuate the people.[15] Many other banks in southern Thailand were later closed.[16] According to officials, the severe flooding did not affect the Thailand Stock exchange as it was expected.[17] Thousands of the residents fled from Thailand seeing the deadly impact of the monsoon and the tropical depression.[18] Many more tourists were said to have been trapped in Thailand as rail and air transport services were suspended.[19] Several attempts were made to rescue the stranded people in Thailand. The Samui airport was closed temporarily due to heavy downpours and poor visibility. About 100 foreign tourists were reported to be stranded on Angthong Island because of high waves.[20] Thailand's prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva called the flooding in the south that displaced thousands of people \"one of the worst natural calamities\" to hit the country.[21] Many districts are under as much as three metres of water. One resident has been electrocuted during the flooding. Officials said a woman was forced to give birth in her room in an apartment block as the high floodwaters prevented her from being taken to hospital.[22] Exports of electronic goods and automotive parts to Malaysia have been partially suspended as the Sadao border checkpoint has been closed because Hat Yai has been hard hit by flooding as the logistics operators explained. The shipments of consumer goods, raw materials, and petrol between Bangkok and the South have been delayed by many hours, raising concerns that shortages may occur if a new storm hits the region in the next few days.[23] Prakit Chinamourphong, president of the Thai Hotels Association (THA), stated that it was too early to evaluate tourism damage from the floods as many areas of the town could not be reached or contacted. Suchart Sirankanokkul, the president of the THA Southern Chapter, explained that many people were stranded as water levels had reached the roofs of some properties.[24] The flooding this year is the most severe since November 2000, when the inundation of Hat Yai and its 16 neighbouring districts resulted in 20 deaths.[25] Businesses and individuals who help with the donations or who have mobilised funding support for flood relief operations will also be entitled to the tax cut. Revenue Department director-general Satit Rungkasiri explains that the tax cut would apply to donations and flood damage between September and December.[26] The State Railway of Thailand suspended services on eight routes due to flooded tracks in the Songkhla area. A school director in southern Songkhla province pleaded for emergency help for some 120 Muslim students stranded in a mosque in flood-hit Hat Yai district. Yusuf Nima, the director of Hat Yai Witthayakhan School, said the students were stranded at the Dinul Islam Mosque since Tuesday after flash floods had hit Hat Yai.[27] Thai troops scrambled to reach thousands of people stranded after flash floods swept through a major southern city, as the government expressed optimism it could reach all those trapped. Rising waters began to inundate Hat Yai, a city of more than 150,000 in Songkhla province, late Monday after days of heavy downpours, affecting tens of thousands of people, possibly including foreign tourists.[28] Flooding has hit 48 of Thailand's 77 provinces, with the death toll rising by three to 107 people, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said in a statement today. The waters have impacted a tenth of the country's 66 million people and damaged more than 3 percent of total agricultural land.[29] Thailand's meteorological department said the storm was moving west, away from Thailand, but warned of 13-foot waves in some coastal areas and the possibility of landslides and flash floods for residents in low-lying areas.[30] The Finance Ministry says flooding this year, which has also hit northeastern and central provinces, could cut economic growth by 0.2 percentage point.[31] In Chumphon, a navy team was reported to have rescued nine people, including four children, trapped in a house near a dam construction site in tambon Suan Taeng of Lamae district.[32] The government's Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department said 122 people have died and nearly 6 million residents in 39 provinces in the northern, central, eastern, and northeastern regions had been affected by two weeks of heavy floods in October. Rows of cars submerged in the floodwaters were being removed from the streets and piles of trash were taken away by trucks.[33] Despite relief efforts pouring in, heavily flooded Hat Yai district in Songkhla province remained in crisis, with high flood waters in urban areas and widespread effects reported in the outskirts. The Information and Communications Technology Ministry reported damage to 80 of its 200 towers after generators attached to them were flooded. There have been no official figures on flood damage but an initial estimate, from Hat Yai Mayor Phrai Phatthana, cited 80 per cent of urban areas and 30,000 households affected, and 10,000 residents stranded in their homes.[34] The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has delivered 1,000 survival kits and 17 flat-bottom boats to Na Thawee and hard-hit Hat Yai district. The Thai Red Cross Society has set up mobile kitchens to feed flood victims in Ayutthaya, mainly serving breakfast to monks in the morning, lunch to relief workers, and dinner to villagers.[35] Education Minister Chinnaworn Boonyakiat on Wednesday confirmed 1,186 schools in the southern provinces have been affected by flooding\u2014555  in  Songkhla, 350 in Pattani, seven in Yala, 28 in Narathiwat, 150 in Phatthalung, 63 in Nakhon Si Thammarat, 20 in Trang, and 13 in Satun. Buildings encroaching over waterways were found to have obstructed water flows. The Royal Irrigation Department would speed up dredging canals and build more reservoirs to retain water.[36] Thailand's only aircraft carrier has been converted into a floating kitchen, to airlift hot food to people affected by massive flooding in the south. Last month, the kingdom's central provinces were also flooded by unusually heavy monsoon rains.[37] Commenting on rice prices, the Singapore General Rice Importers Association (SGRIA) said it is keeping prices at the pre-flood levels for now despite a 5 to 10 per cent increase. Singapore imports 65 per cent of its rice from Thailand but it is not clear how much of it is from Hat Yai.[38] The deluge in Thailand's south \u2013 along a peninsula it shares with Malaysia \u2013 followed two weeks of heavy floods in October, mostly in central and northeastern Thailand, that killed more than 107 people. Nearly 6 million residents of 38 provinces were affected by October's floods, according to the government's Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department.[39] As the water recedes, residents and tourists who were trapped in their homes and hotels for almost 48 hours were able to move around yesterday to get food and other supplies. Food was being prepared at several locations including Prince of Songkla University for distribution to those stranded in their homes.[40] At least 100 Singaporeans could have been stuck in southern Thailand due to the floods, said travel agents, with some estimating as many as 400 or more. Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said it was in contact with most of Singaporeans stranded. It said all who contacted the ministry were safe and some were on their way out of Hat Yai.[41] Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said the cabinet had agreed to the proposals aimed at helping flood victims. Besides, the cabinet had also agreed to allow the Finance Ministry to divert 4 billion baht from its Strong Thailand budget, in addition to the 20,000 million baht central budget already approved, for the same purpose. As for the 5,000-baht compensation for each flood victim's family, the government would disburse the amount this week,[when?] starting in Nakorn Ratchasima Province. The Interior Ministry would be tasked with verifying information on rental houses affected from floods to ensure that compensation would be paid to only those eligible for it.[42] On the night of 1 November 2010, after three consecutive days of rain, the provinces of Pattani, Songkhla, and Trang were hit by a Tropical Depression which made landfall directly at Amphoe Mueang Pattani, causing significant damage and destruction. The city of Hat Yai, being located in a basin, received water from the mountains in the outskirts and reported floodwater as high as 2\u00a0meters in some locations in the downtown area. Despite early warning by the Thai Meteorological Department, tens of thousands of residents could not be evacuated on time and were trapped in their homes. Those living in one-storey houses needed to escape the floodwater on their rooftops. Meanwhile, rescue and relief efforts to bring food and other necessities to the victims were hampered by the lack of boats and strong currents.\nThe southern provinces, hit by flooding triggered by tropical depression-related rainstorms, reported 43 deaths from 30 Oct to 7 and 12 Nov southern provinces overall have been flooded. The confirmed death toll from the heavy flooding in many provinces since 10 Oct has risen to 215, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation reported on Saturday morning.[43] In conjunction with very high amounts of floodwaters, there is the extra danger of mud or landslides in over 6 thousand villages in fifty-one provinces, twice as much as the number reported 7 years ago.[44] Due to the remote location of the affected area, the emergency packages were prepared in Bangkok and transported some 560 miles (900\u00a0km) to the southern province of Songkla, Hat Yai being the provincial capital. ADRA set up a distribution point close to the Prince of Songkla University, an area near Hat Yai that is unaffected by the floods due to higher elevation.[45] As it continued to rain in the South, riverside residents in Chomporn, Suratthani, Nakornsrithammarat, Trang, and Satul have been warned of possible mudslides and flash floods in the next few days.[46] Their worries emerge as 130 shrimp farms covering 20,000 rai of coastal area in six districts have been damaged by the floods, causing losses worth about 200 million baht. Farmers are concerned shellfish could die all at once, causing up to 2 to 3 billion baht in damage after oyster and cockle farms in coastal areas in Ban Don and Chaiya were invaded by freshwater, said Sila Wandee, chairman of Surat Thai's local fisherman group.[47] The confirmed death toll from floods  has risen to 232 on 19 November 2010.[48] The department said a total of 156 people in the North, Northeast, East, and Central Plains and 76 in the South had died in the floodwaters.[49]"

Another official with the National Flood Monitoring Centre said more than 2,200 people in another northern state, Perlis, were evacuated.[50] Over 36,000 people were transported to relief shelters, while rains and flooding caused two deaths.[51]\nThe floods affected transportation in and around Kedah and Perlis, shutting down rail and closing roads including the North\u2013South Expressway.[52] Alor Setar's Sultan Abdul Halim Airport was also closed after its runway was flooded, leaving helicopters as the only mode of aerial transport into Kedah and Perlis.[53] The floods also contaminated the water supply in Kedah and Perlis, forcing the states to receive supplies from the neighbouring state of Perak.[54] Rice production, a key industry in Kedah and Perlis, was badly affected by the floods. According to the federal government, over 45,000 hectares of rice fields were damaged in Kedah alone. The government pledged 26 million ringgit in aid to farmers in both states.[55] The floods killed at least four people in Kedah, including a foreign national. Around 50,000 people were evacuated, the floods even affecting the house of Kedah's Chief Minister Azizan Abdul Razak.[56][57] In Perlis, the floods submerged over two-thirds of the state's land in water.[58] The north-eastern state of Kelantan was also affected by the floods, causing the closure of some schools.[59]"

The Federal Minister for Housing and Local Government and Alor Setar MP Chor Chee Heung criticised the Kedah State government (led by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, an opponent of Chor's Barisan Nasional coalition) for what he considered a slow response to the floods and the government's inexperience. Chor's own home in Alor Setar was flooded.[60][61] Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin claimed the State government had a responsibility to assist victims of the flood.[62] Kedah's Chief Minister Azizan argued that his government's response had been \"quick\" and that 300,000 ringgit in aid had been committed to the affected areas.[58] Kedah's Sultan Abdul Halim called publicly for politics to be set aside for the purposes of dealing with the floods.[63] In Thailand, the opposition Puea Thai Party on Friday petitioned the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) to take legal action against Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, claiming he acted too slowly to counter the effects from the recent flooding, resulting in massive damage to property and many deaths. The petition filed by Puea Thai spokesman Prompong Nopparit accuses the prime minister of malfeasance in violation of Article 157 of the Criminal Code. Mr. Prompong said the prime minister has the administrative power to ensure swift action to prevent and mitigate effects from flooding under Article 4 of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act of 2007, but had not properly exercised his authority.[64] The floods attracted attention from around the world. The Chinese government intended to provide humanitarian aid and has granted 10 million yuan for the flooded area's restoration.[65] US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton extended her condolences for the loss of life and damage caused by severe flooding throughout Thailand, pledging additional help when needed. Clinton said in a statement that the US Embassy in Bangkok has offered immediate disaster relief assistance following the flooding, and is \"working closely\" with the Thai government to provide additional help if needed.[66]"

Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) governor Narongsak Kamales said some parts of Hat Yai started to have electricity since 9:00 pm last night but he warned the residents to carefully check the electrical system before turn on any switch.[67] Law and order have been largely maintained, with constant patrols by police and volunteers, but minor looting was reported and caught on camera after a few similar incidents took place earlier. The Prince of Songkhla University compound has been packed with people seeking help during the crisis, as it served as both a rally and a pick-up point for relief supplies, and its hospital as a medical service centre.[68] Rail service to the region was partially restored Thursday morning and the airport on Samui island, a popular tourist destination in the Gulf of Thailand, reopened after a temporary shutdown caused by a submerged runway.[69] On the bright side, the research centre predicted the floods would bring seed money back into the economic system as the government would earmark relief funds for flood victims and rehabilitation of the flooded areas.[70] In Hat Yai, many residents were caught off-guard by the flash flood despite evacuation warnings, suggesting either that the cautions were unheard or simply ignored. Urban planning, national irrigation strategies, and flood control systems also need a drastic rethink, particularly when one considers the future threat that climate change and rising sea levels will have on Bangkok and other populated coastal areas in the years to come.[71] The Thai community in Brunei has been urged to provide humanitarian relief to the victims of the flood-affected areas back home. Thawat, the Acting Ambassador of Thai Embassy said that donations can be given in the form of money or goods such as clothing.[72] As the water level in many areas, including Hat Yai district of Songkhla, has receded significantly and Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has already handed out the first lot of 5,000-baht cash aid to flood-affected families in the Northeast as an initial compensation amount from the government, it remains to be seen if families who suffered casualties will receive compensation from the Fund for Disaster Victims as promised.[73] The Cabinet assigned state agencies to help people affected by the floods and advance payments of over Bt100 million was endorsed to aid people affected by floods in Nakhon Ratchasima and Lop Buri.[74] Private citizens were on the forefront, soliciting donations from other members of the public, rushing aid to flood-stricken areas, and distributing relief packages to flood victims.[75]"

        "content": "According to the constitution, the normal term of office for a president is six years, although an incumbent serving a second term may call an election at any time after four years in office.[30] In November 2009, buoyed by the government's defeat of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in May 2009, incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa called an early presidential election.[31] In the elections held in January 2010 Rajapaksa secured a second term in office, defeating common opposition candidate Sarath Fonseka.[32][33] In February 2010 the Supreme Court ruled that Rajapaksa's second term would begin in November 2010, and was accordingly sworn in on 19 November 2010.[34][35][36] In September 2010 Parliament, which was controlled by Rajapaksa's UPFA, passed the eighteenth amendment to the constitution, removing the two term limit on presidents, allowing Rajapaksa to run for a third term.[37] There was speculation in mid-2014 that Rajapaksa would call another early presidential election: on 20 October 2014 Minister of Mass Media and Information Keheliya Rambukwella confirmed that the election would be held in January 2015.[16][38] Critics of Rajapaksa, including the Bar Association and former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva, argued that he could not stand for re-election as he had won his second term before the eighteenth amendment to the constitution had been passed.[39][40][41] In early November 2014 Rajapaksa sought the Supreme Court's opinion on whether he could stand for re-election.[17][42] The court ruled that Rajapaksa could stand for re-election.[43][44] The independence of the Supreme Court has been questioned since the UPFA impeached former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake, allowing Rajapaksa to appoint an ally and legal adviser, former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, as Chief Justice.[45][46][47] On 20 November 2014 Rajapaksa issued a proclamation calling for a presidential election at which he would seek re-election.[18][48][49] The following day election commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya announced that nominations would be taken on 8 December 2014 and that the election would be held on 8 January 2015.[19][50] 15,044,490 Sri Lankans were eligible to vote at the election.[51][52] Postal voting was held on 23 and 24 December 2014.[21][22] Foreign monitors were invited to observe the election but not from the United Nations.[53]"

K. D. S. Gunawardena, Wasantha Senanayake, Rajitha Senaratne, Rajiva Wijesinha).[106][107][108] Sirisena and the other UPFA MPs were stripped of their ministerial positions and expelled from the SLFP.[109][110][111] On 30 November minister Navin Dissanayake resigned from the UPFA government and defected to the opposition to support Sirisena.[112][113] Two deputy ministers, Palani Digambaran and Velusami Radhakrishnan, resigned from the UPFA government on 10 December 2014 to support Sirisena.[114][115] Two other deputy ministers, Faiszer Musthapha and Nandimithra Ekanayake, resigned from the UPFA government, on 31 December 2014 and 1 January 2015 respectively, to support Sirisena.[116][117][118] Sirisena received the support of UPFA MP Achala Jagodage on 2 January 2015.[119][120] Sirisena pledged to abolish the executive presidency within 100 days of being elected, repeal the controversial eighteenth amendment, re-instate the seventeenth amendment and appoint UNP leader Ranil Wickremasinghe as Prime Minister.[121][122][123] On 1 December 2014, Sirisena signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with 36 opposition parties/civic groups promising to abolish the executive presidency, hold parliamentary elections, form an all-party national government and carry out various political reforms.[124][125] Signatories to the MOU include the UNP, Sarath Fonseka's Democratic Party, Democratic People's Front, Azath Salley's Muslim Tamil National Alliance, Free Media Movement, Federation of University Teachers Association as well as dissident groups of the LSSP and Communist Party.[126][127] The following day the JHU announced that it would support Sirisena in the presidential election.[128][129] On 30 December 2014 the Tamil National Alliance, the largest political party representing the Sri Lankan Tamil people, endorsed Sirisena.[130] Sirisena contested as a New Democratic Front (NDF) candidate under its swan symbol.[131][132] Common opposition candidate Sarath Fonseka contested in the 2010 presidential election as a NDF candidate under its swan symbol.[133] Sirisena released his manifesto, titled A Compassionate Maithri Governance\u00a0\u2014 A Stable Country, on 19 December 2014 during a rally at Viharamahadevi Park.[134][135] The main pledge in his manifesto was the replacement of the executive presidency with a Westminster style cabinet, but the manifesto acknowledged that Sirisena would need the support of the parliament to amend the constitution.[136] The manifesto also makes a commitment to replace the open list proportional representation system with a mixture of first-past-the-post and PR for electing MPs.[136] Independent commissions would be established to oversee the judiciary, police, elections department, Auditor-General's Department and Attorney-General's Department.[137][138] The Commission on Bribery and Corruption would be strengthened and political diplomatic appointments annulled.[137][138][139] Populist measures in the manifesto included a commitment to write-off 50% of farmers' loans, reduce fuel prices by removing taxes and a salary increase of Rs.10,000 for public servants.[138][140][141][142] Public spending on health would increase from 1.8% of GDP to 3% of GDP whilst that on education would increase from 1.7% of GDP to 6% of GDP.[143][144] The manifesto also stated that the casino licences granted to Kerry Packer's Crown Resort and John Keells Holdings's Water Front would be cancelled.[145] Political victims during Rajapaks's rule, such as Sarath Fonseka and Shirani Bandaranayake, would be re-appointed.[140][146] In a separate document, Sirisena has pledged that, whilst resisting any international investigation, he would establish an independent domestic inquiry into the alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War.[138][147]"

The growing Chinese tilt of Rajapaksa was viewed by India with unease. Further, it was alleged that R&AW Chief of Station in Colombo helped co-ordination of talks within the opposition, and convinced former PM Ranil Wickremesinghe not to stand against Rajapaksa, but to choose a common opposition candidate, who had better chances of winning. The agent was also alleged to have been in touch with Chandrika Kumaratunga, who played a key role in convincing Maithripala Sirisena to be the common candidate.

Some of these cities were even left without water due to the power outages.[1][50][51] In the city of Carbondale, damage was estimated at US$3,000,000, excluding damage at Southern Illinois University. Officials deemed 34 buildings a \"total loss\" and reported that 3,000 trees were felled throughout the city.[52] Preliminary estimates placed damages at Southern Illinois University in excess of US$5,000,000. Numerous buildings on campus sustained roof damage, and nearly 100 windows were blown out of residence halls. Due to infrastructure damage from the storm, most communication by land line and mobile phone was reported to be impossible.[52] In Carterville, Illinois, officials found 17 buildings to be a total loss. The city's public works garage was shifted off its foundation, and the police station sustained damage.[52] In Franklin County, Illinois, 13 buildings were deemed to be beyond repair; damage assessments found that 184 buildings received some kind of damage from the storm. Winds were estimated between 80 and 90\u00a0mph (130 and 140\u00a0km/h) in the county.[52] At one point, 68,000 people were left without power in southern Illinois alone, prompting unusual methods to restore power, such as using helicopters to clear debris and position power poles.[53]"

Up to ten drivers required rescue after their cars stalled in the flood waters.[58] Flowing water over the Kansas Turnpike forced officials to shut down a 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) stretch of the highway for over an hour.[59] One person needed to be rescued in Lyon County after driving into a flooded street. Barricades were set up in some areas of the county due to rising waters.[60] In Reno County, four bridges sustained severe flood damage and another was destroyed. Damages to the bridges amounted to $500,000.[61] In some places, schools canceled classes due to the heavy rainfall.[62] In parts of Missouri, up to 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain fell in a short period of time, triggering flash flooding. Along Missouri Route 89, flood waters reached a depth of some 2 feet (60\u00a0cm.).[63] Numerous side roads throughout several counties were closed due to flooding.[64] In Washington County, the Big River overflowed its banks and inundated a nearby highway.[65] More significant flooding took place in St. Francois County, where some homes had up to 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) of water in their basements and railroads were partially washed out.[66] A water rescue took place near the town of Bloomsdale.[67] Some of the most severe flooding took place in the town of Doniphan, in Ripley County, where 5.03\u00a0in (128\u00a0mm) of rain fell in a 24-hour span. Ten people needed to be evacuated from their homes due to rising waters. The county courthouse and local high school sustained major water damage. At the school, all of the classrooms were flooded by up to 18\u00a0in (460\u00a0mm) of water, and a nearby parking lot buckled under the water. Several other structures in the area were also inundated during the storm, and two people needed to be rescued from their vehicle, which was stalled in waist-deep water.[68] In Laclede County, severe flooding washed out low-lying roads and drainage culverts.[69]"

The flooding affected 5.4 million people across 32 districts and caused the deaths of over 200[2] people across the affected districts.[3][1] Silchar town, located just 1\u00a0km from the dyke was the worst affected, with 90 percent of the town underwater.[4] While there are several reasons that caused the floods in the region to the extent that it did, there is a definite man-made aspect to the degree of damage that it caused. The Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sharma also noted this in his address to the people.[5] On 2 July, one man named Kabul Khan was arrested for breaching the embankment which caused the floods. He had also taken a video of the breach.[6] By 6 July, 3 more people were arrested for the deed.[7] The Chief Minister of Assam Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the flood was a man made calamity and those responsible would face a harsh punishment.[8] He termed the act as a sabotage.[9] Silchar town remained submerged for 11 days, with water rising up to 12 feet (3.7 metres) in some places.[9]"

But overnight, as the storm slowly crawled northward, extremely heavy bands of snow came in from the east.  These bands created whiteout conditions as winds gusted past 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h), along with thunder and lightning.\nBy the morning of January 8, the bands tapered off, and the metro area was left with a blanket of 15 to 25 inches (38 to 64\u00a0cm) of snow.

Because of unseasonably warm weather in mid-January and a warm rain exceeding an inch (2.5\u00a0cm) on Monday, January 15, the snow melted quickly and caused the worst winter flooding in decades for river and stream valleys from Southwest Virginia to New York.[8]"

The mayor declared a state of emergency, and only police and other emergency workers were permitted to drive on city streets leaving the city to pedestrians. For three days, city trucks loaded with plowed snow dumped their contents into the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers eventually causing major problems with the natural flow of the rivers. It is a rare occurrence for trucks to \"dispose of snow\" in the Philadelphia area, since the snowfall amounts typically do not warrant it. However the snow was so extensive, that plowing would cause massive snow piles. City officials had no choice but to resort to hauling the snow to nearby rivers.  Disposal of snow became a major issue but temperatures quickly returned to normal and began to quickly clear the snow. This resulted in flooding, when on January 19, a jet stream disturbance from the Gulf of Mexico caused a rapid melt, followed by thunderstorms, which both brought three inches (76\u00a0mm) of rain, and caused the snow to melt 20 inches (51\u00a0cm) in one day; or equivalent to 2 inches (5\u00a0cm) of rain. Philadelphia saw its worst flooding in twenty years.  Damages were estimated to reach US$1 billion.[10] Snowfall accumulations averaged 20 to 22 inches (51 to 56\u00a0cm) in Monroe, Carbon and eastern Schuylkill Counties, around 2 feet (61\u00a0cm) in Lehigh and Northampton Counties, 24 to 33 inches (61 to 84\u00a0cm) in Berks County, 20 to 26 inches (51 to 66\u00a0cm) in Chester and Delaware Counties, 20 to 30 inches (51 to 76\u00a0cm) in Montgomery and Bucks Counties.

Blizzard conditions developed during the afternoon and evening as strong northeast winds developed around the intensifying low pressure. During the afternoon hours, precipitation in far southern New Jersey changed to sleet and freezing rain as the low brought in warm air at mid-levels, but remained all snow across the rest of the state. During the evening and overnight hours the snow mixed with sleet as far north as central sections of the state as the low center approached the state from the south. A lull developed in the precipitation in the pre-dawn hours of January 8 as the low center was just off the New Jersey coast, but wraparound moisture brought another period of snow to the state as the low pulled away during the later morning and early afternoon hours of the January 8. Accumulations averaged 24 to 27 inches (61 to 69\u00a0cm) in Sussex County, 20 to 27 inches (51 to 69\u00a0cm) in Warren County, 23 to 28 inches (58 to 71\u00a0cm) in Morris County, generally 20 to 30 inches (51 to 76\u00a0cm) in Bergen, Passaic, Union, Hudson, Essex, Hunterdon, Somerset, Mercer, and Monmouth counties, 19 to 32 inches (48 to 81\u00a0cm) in Middlesex County, 18 to 31 inches (46 to 79\u00a0cm) in Burlington County, 16 to 24 inches (41 to 61\u00a0cm) in Salem, Gloucester, and Camden counties, 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) inland and 10 to 14 inches (25 to 36\u00a0cm) at the coast in Ocean County, and 10 to 18 inches (25 to 46\u00a0cm) in Cumberland, Atlantic, and Cape May counties. In addition to the heavy snow, wind gusts reached hurricane force along the coast during the evening of the 7th, with an 81 miles per hour (130\u00a0km/h) gust recorded in Ocean Grove. While accumulations were lighter along the shore, the strong northeasterly flow produced moderate coastal flooding at the time of high tide on the evening of January 7, with tides 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) above normal. The tide reached 7.5 feet (2.3\u00a0m) above mean low water in Atlantic County and 8.5 feet (2.6\u00a0m) above mean low water in Cape May County. Fortunately, winds switched to the northwest before worse flooding could occur at high tide on the morning of January 8. The state of New Jersey recorded its second-largest snowstorm at Edison, where 32 inches (81\u00a0cm) fell (the greatest single storm record being 34 inches (86\u00a0cm) at Cape May in the Great Blizzard of 1899). Elizabeth, New Jersey, also reported 32 inches (81\u00a0cm) of snow. Newark, the state's largest city, received a record-setting 27.8 inches (71\u00a0cm), while Trenton, the capital, received 24.6 inches (62.5\u00a0cm).[11] All roads in the state were closed, including the entire length of the New Jersey Turnpike for the first time in that road's history. Over two-thirds of the state was buried under 2 feet (61\u00a0cm) of snow, making this storm the state's most paralyzing snowstorm of the 20th\u00a0century. Places such as Roselle and Linden received around 30 inches (76\u00a0cm). New Jersey was, along with other states, put into a state of emergency. \"Two feet of snow was blasted into Greater Trenton by 50 mph winds that created giant drifts, paralyzing the region and the rest of the Northeast for a week, One writer called it the most \u201csadistic\u201d storm of our century.\nThe Blizzard of '96 stranded hundreds of people at Trenton's train station; left thousands without electricity and heat for days; closed most schools and government offices for a week; cut off an estimated US$1 billion in Jersey commerce; forced the National Guard into service rescuing state troopers from snowbound police cruisers; and created strife between officials and residents demanding the plowing of their little streets. In the second week of January 1996, it can be said, many locales across the region looked like they did in the old pictures taken of them during the infamous Blizzard of '88: Houses drifted under; snowed-in main streets that looked like ghost towns; no cars or people on the streets.\"[12]"

Schools in New York City's boroughs closed because of snow for the first time since the Blizzard of 1978, 18 years earlier. While most suburban districts in the area close for snow several times each winter, in the city itself they rarely do because of relatively easy access to underground subways whose ability to run is not appreciably affected by snowstorms of moderate to large accumulation; however, in this snowstorm, the transit network was significantly disrupted.

Daily peak wind gusts ranging from 46 to 69\u00a0mph (74 to 111\u00a0km/h) were recorded by the National Weather Service in Buffalo, with snowfall as high as 100\u00a0in (254\u00a0cm) recorded in areas,[1] and the high winds blew this into drifts of 30 to 40\u00a0ft (9 to 12\u00a0m).[2] There were 23 total storm-related deaths in Western New York, with five more in northern New York.[3] Certain pre-existing weather conditions exacerbated the blizzard's effects. November, December and January average temperatures were severely below normal. Lake Erie froze over by December 14, 1976; when this occurs, lake-effect snow does not occur because the wind cannot pick up moisture from the lake's surface, convert the moisture to snow, and then dump it when the winds reach shore. Lake Erie was covered by a deep, powdery snow; January's unusually cold conditions limited the usual thawing and refreezing, so the snow on the frozen lake remained powdery. The drifted snow on roadways was difficult to clear because the strong wind packed the snow into a solid state. In addition to the roads becoming impassable, motorists had to deal with vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds and blowing snow. In the hardest-struck areas, snowmobiles became the only viable method of transportation. In Western New York and Southern Ontario's Niagara Peninsula, snow which was accumulated on frozen Lake Erie and snow on the ground at the start of the blizzard provided ample material for the high winds to blow into huge drifts. The combination of bitter cold, high winds, and blowing snow paralyzed areas affected by the storm. Lake Ontario rarely freezes over, which meant northern New York had to deal with considerable lake-effect snow. Coupled with the existing snow cover and wind, this had a similar effect."

A high-amplitude planetary wave pattern set up,[4] which was very persistent from October 1976 through January 1977, and involved a ridge over western North America and a trough over eastern North America.[5] In January 1977, this pattern persisted, with the pressure of the strong ridge over western North America being more than two standard deviations from the mean, while the strong trough centered over eastern North America was more than three standard deviations from the mean.[5] A strong blocking high developed over the Arctic Ocean during January, and this moved the polar vortex to southern Canada, south of its normal location.[6] Strong northwest flow between the ridge and the trough resulted in a strong northwest flow in between, which ushered Arctic air into the central and eastern United States.[6] The circulation helped cause record cold for the winter over many portions of the eastern United States, with the Ohio Valley averaging more than 8\u00a0\u00b0F (4\u00a0\u00b0C) below normal.[4] The severe winter was not limited to the northeastern United States; snow was observed in Miami, Florida, on January 20, and snow mixed with rain occurred in the Bahamas.[7] In contrast, Alaska was exceptionally mild: Anchorage averaged 20.2\u00a0\u00b0F or 11.2\u00a0\u00b0C above normal and was in fact 2.5\u00a0\u00b0F or 1.4\u00a0\u00b0C warmer for the month than Atlanta half the distance from the equator,[5][a] whilst it was the warmest January since at least 1937 for the whole state except the North Slope and the Aleutian Islands.[b] The Pacific Northwest, located under the strong ridge, experienced unprecedented drought, with all 29 climatic divisions of Washington, Oregon and Idaho experiencing their driest October to February period on record.[10]"

Buffalo was a city of about 463,000\u00a0people with about 1.5\u00a0million in the metropolitan area, the second most populated city in New York State.[13] The first trace of snow of the winter at the Buffalo NWS weather station in Cheektowaga, New York, occurred on October 9, while the first accumulating snow was on October 21.[11] Elsewhere in western New York, lake effect snow was observed in two periods, with up to 4\u00a0in (10\u00a0cm) on October 17\u201318 and up to 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) on October 21\u201322 (O'Connell 1977). By the last day of October, Lake Erie was 48\u00a0\u00b0F (9\u00a0\u00b0C), the coldest it had been on that date.[14] November's air temperature in Buffalo was the coldest in nearly 100 years (since 1880), with an average temperature of 34.1\u00a0\u00b0F (1.2\u00a0\u00b0C). November's average temperature was about 11\u00a0\u00b0F (6\u00a0\u00b0C) below normal.[15] The first three weeks of November were quite dry in Buffalo \u2013 only 0.30\u00a0in (7.6\u00a0mm) of precipitation \u2013 and November as a whole was drier than normal. During late November, some heavy snow occurred, including 19\u00a0in (48\u00a0cm) on November 30 \u2013 up to 4\u00a0ft (120\u00a0cm) in southern Erie County, Buffalo's county.[16] The total November snowfall was recorded as 31.3\u00a0in (80\u00a0cm) in Buffalo.[15] December was cold and snowy, with an average temperature of 22.0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22125.6\u00a0\u00b0C).[14] Like November, December's average temperature was also about 11\u00a0\u00b0F (6\u00a0\u00b0C) below normal.[15] December's snowfall was 60.7\u00a0in (154\u00a0cm).[15] Daily snow depth readings varied from 2 to 26\u00a0in (5.1 to 66.0\u00a0cm),[11] with a maximum measured snow depth of 31\u00a0in (79\u00a0cm) at 3:40\u00a0p.m. on December 2.[16] Lake Erie froze over by December 14; this was a record.[17] An ice-covered Lake Erie usually puts an end to lake effect snowstorms, because the wind cannot pick up moisture from the lake's surface, convert the moisture to snow and then dump it when the winds reach shore.[17] The wintry weather continued in January, with the monthly average temperature being 13.8\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221210.1\u00a0\u00b0C), the coldest on record (records began in 1870 in Buffalo).[16] January's average temperature was 10\u00a0\u00b0F (6\u00a0\u00b0C) below normal.[15] It never rose to freezing in Buffalo that month, the first January that had occurred.[18] Prior to January 28, the day the blizzard started, it had snowed almost every day since just after Christmas.[17] By January 27, Buffalo's snow depth was 59.1\u00a0in (150\u00a0cm).[15] There was continuous snow cover from November 29 until the day of the blizzard, and 151.3\u00a0in (384\u00a0cm) of snow had fallen that winter prior to the blizzard \u2013 59.1\u00a0in (150\u00a0cm) in January alone[14] \u2013 well above normal even for a city that averages about 100\u00a0in (250\u00a0cm) of snowfall per year. This resulted in a snow depth of 33\u00a0in (84\u00a0cm) on the day the blizzard started.[14] Low pressure crossed Lake Erie on January 27 and moved to James Bay; it became stalled east of James Bay.[15] Then the storm moved back west over James Bay before finally moving east to the Canadian Maritimes.[15]"

Between 7:00 and 8:00 am, Columbus, Ohio, reported similar situations.[28] Toledo and Cleveland, Ohio, as well as Erie, Pennsylvania, were also hit strongly by the cold front. The NWS office in Erie warned \"travel might be disastrous\"; and there were more than 500 accidents in the area that morning.[29] From midnight to 11:00 am, the temperature at the Buffalo airport rose from 5 to 26\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221215 to \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C).[15] Snow began around 5:00 am, with about 2\u00a0in (5\u00a0cm) of new snow prior to the beginning of the blizzard.[30] At 4:00 am, the Buffalo NWS office indicated \"very strong winds will once again produce near blizzard conditions beginning late this afternoon and continuing tonight\".[31] At 11:00 am, a blizzard warning was issued, which was the first time the Buffalo NWS office had done this.[32] That morning observers on the 16th floor of the M&T Bank Building in Buffalo watched as a gray wall covered the city; it appeared white as it came closer. A blast of wind hit the building that caused the floor to move and the glass window to creak, and then the wall of white enveloped the building. It was 11:10 am.[33] On the previous day, the governor of New York had decided to use the National Guard and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to help clean up snow in Buffalo, not knowing a blizzard would hit. Some NYSDOT equipment had arrived in Buffalo while the National Guard was not yet mobilized, but a meeting was being held at the Buffalo city garage that morning to coordinate the efforts. Before the meeting finished, Buffalo city plows started to return to the garage due to a lack of visibility; they reported they were unable to see even their own plow blades.[34] By 11:30 am, most workers in the city of Buffalo had been released early, but few made it home.[35] At 11:35 am, lightning was seen in the darkening sky.[36] The white wall of snow reached the airport around 11:30 am.[37][30] associated with the cold front.[1] Winds increased to 29\u00a0mph (47\u00a0km/h), gusting to 49\u00a0mph (79\u00a0km/h), with visibility dropping from 0.75\u00a0mi (1.2\u00a0km) to 0[30] where it stayed until 12:50 am the next day.[38] Three airplanes on the tarmac at the Greater Buffalo International Airport in Cheektowaga were waiting to take off when the blizzard hit.[39] One of them idled for five minutes due to the blizzard hitting; this resulted in the nose wheel freezing and preventing it from turning around.[40] It took several hours to bring the three airplanes back to the terminal since they had to do this via radio communication. The limited visibility prevented the pilots from seeing the men on the ground who would normally guide the airplane.[39]"

In addition to the roads becoming impassable, motorists also had to deal with vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds, and blowing snow. For example, a maintenance pickup truck at the Buffalo airport had snow blasted into the engine compartment that then melted, saturated the spark plugs, and stalled the engine.[44] A report from Welland, Ontario, (see section below for a description of the blizzard in Canada) indicated many cars overheated when snow got under the radiator, melted, and then refroze, interfering with the fan.[45] Those attempting to travel by foot also found travel very difficult with the high winds, low visibility, deep snow, and very low wind chills. Visibility had dropped from 0.75 to 0\u00a0mi (1.2 to 0.0\u00a0km); winds had increased to 29\u00a0mph (47\u00a0km/h), with gusts up to 49\u00a0mph (79\u00a0km/h).[15] Pedestrians were knocked down by the wind in city streets and struggled to regain footing, so pairs of policemen pulled them into buildings.[46] People formed human chains from the Memorial Auditorium to people stranded in cars so the motorists would not get lost trying to find shelter.[47] Locations west of Buffalo that were hit by the cold front only were affected for two to three hours,[48] and western New York was thought to be the same.[37] By 1:30 pm, Buffalo radar indicated almost no snow, and it became clear snow was being blown off frozen Lake Erie.[49] Since the lake had frozen in December, the snow that fell had built up on the lake [recall the Buffalo airport reported 59.1\u00a0in (150\u00a0cm) of snow in January prior to the blizzard]. Lake Erie was reported to be covered by 'deep, powdery snow' at the beginning of the blizzard.[50] During January, the unusually cold conditions limited thawing and freezing, and thus the snow on the ground (and frozen lake) did not consolidate into a form that would limit drifting.[51] The new snow associated with the cold front and the snow that had accumulated on land and frozen Lake Erie were all blown by the strong winds and created drifts of over 25\u00a0ft (8\u00a0m) in metropolitan Buffalo.[1] During the blizzard, about 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of \"new\" snow fell, and much of this was thought to be from snow that had been in the snowpack on Lake Erie.[30] The drifted snow from the blizzard was difficult to clear for reasons illuminated by NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker: \"The wind was so strong that it packed the snow. It broke the snow crystals up so they really packed in solidly, almost like a form of cement\".[52] As discussed later in this article, normal snow clearing methods could not be used in many cases due to the height of the drifts and the tight packing of the snow.[51]"

Looting broke out and items stolen included radios and firefighters' clothing from fire trucks,[57] as well as more than $1,500 in medical supplies from a stuck ambulance.[58] Cigarettes, liquor, beer, coffee, meat and refrigerators were stolen from abandoned semi-trailer trucks.[59] There was also looting from factories, stores (including two jewelry stores and a furniture/appliance store) and homes.[59] Nearly 100 people were arrested for looting.[15] A fire broke out at Whitney Place and Virginia Street, in the City of Buffalo, on Friday evening. Fire trucks rammed through stalled cars in an attempt to get to the scene and fire hoses were stretched two to three blocks to reach the fire, as that is as far as the fire trucks were able to make it.[60] The National Guard assisted in taking firemen to the scene in four-wheel drive vehicles.[61] Not only did the weather frustrate efforts to reach the scene, but also it hampered the ability to fight the fire. Attempts to disconnect hoses to move them resulted in the water freezing and bursting the hoses.[62][63] Since the street drains were blocked with snow, runoff water from the fire rose to the running boards on the fire department's pumpers. When this water froze, it required jackhammers to extricate the pumpers.[62] Hoses also had to be removed with jackhammers.[62][63] Some fire truck pumpers stalled in the snow when wind blew into the engines or they ran out of fuel. Since their design necessitated the use of water instead of antifreeze as a coolant, the water in the pumper froze and ruined them.[64][65] The fire was eventually extinguished, but not before six or seven houses were destroyed and 50\u00a0people left homeless.[66][54][30] Virginia Street and Whitney Place were closed for more than two weeks following the fire due to vehicles stuck in the ice.[67] Firemen used snowmobiles to rescue trapped people, and to transport nurses and doctors to the hospitals;[68] they also used four-wheel drive vehicles to deliver medicine.[69] On Friday, volunteers on four-wheel drive vehicles and snowmobiles delivered food (a few thousand dollars worth every 45 minutes) for the Salvation Army from their Buffalo headquarters.[70] The Red Cross opened eight shelters in Erie County, New York, on Friday, and snowmobile clubs provided volunteers to deliver food, blood and medicine.[71] Snowmobiles were also used to rescue people from the Skyway, as well as from another expressway.[39]"

Many roads in southern Erie County, as well as Niagara, Chautauqua, and Wyoming counties, were drifted shut.[100] At midnight Thursday, Buffalo's driving ban was put back in place.[101] Under pressure from many levels of elected government officials to declare blizzard-affected regions major disaster areas, President Carter sent his son, James Earl (Chip) Carter, and special presidential advisor, Margaret Costanza, to survey the situation on Friday, February 4; the visit included traveling to Buffalo, Lancaster and Cheektowaga.[76][102] On Saturday, President Carter declared the counties of Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Niagara, Orleans and Wyoming in western New York, and the counties of Jefferson and Lewis in northern New York, a major disaster area; this is the first time a snowstorm was declared a federal disaster area.[15] The previous emergency declaration had resulted in the federal government only assisting in snow removal, whereas the major disaster declaration caused the federal government assistance to be \"expanded to include everything to protect life and property and to provide whatever materials and equipment that were required to relieve the emergency and restore the area to normalcy\".[103] The declaration also allowed the local governments to deal directly with private contractors and be reimbursed by the federal government instead of the USACE employing private contractors.[104] On Friday morning, February 4, the NWS had forecast that early Saturday a storm would hit with about 3\u00a0in (7.6\u00a0cm)) of new snow accompanied by strong winds, but the storm did not strike Buffalo.[105] That weekend the Winter Carnival in Buffalo was postponed for the third time due to the too-wintry weather.[106] On Monday, February 7, the driving ban that had been in place since February 3 was lifted at midnight.[86] Cars were required to have at least three people in them and a citywide speed limit of 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) was enacted.[107] That Monday, at least 100 residents of Concord (Erie County), New York were still isolated[107] Many colleges and schools in western New York reopened that day, after having been closed since Thursday, January 27,[108] seven consecutive snow days. Since the local governments were now able to be directly reimbursed by the federal government for contracting with companies for snow removal, the USACE was not assigned further work as of February 8; they finished work in progress and completed their contracting efforts on February 13.[109] The coordinator of the federal disaster relief, Casey, pulled out the Fort Bragg troops on February 8. By February 9, the City of Buffalo had signed agreements with private firms to finish the snow removal, a task that would take nine more days.[104] The temperature rose above freezing for the first time since Christmas on February 9, with a high of 34\u00a0\u00b0F (1\u00a0\u00b0C). The Buffalo mayor also lifted the rule requiring at least three people per car between the hours of 7:00 pm and 6:00 am.[107] The next day, it rose to 39\u00a0\u00b0F (4\u00a0\u00b0C) and then made it to about 45\u00a0\u00b0F (7\u00a0\u00b0C) the next three days.[11] On February 11, Mayor Makowski lifted the driving ban at noon, but the citywide 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) speed limit remained in effect.[107] Buffalo city schools reopened on February 14,[108] after more than 10 consecutive snow days. One school remained open through the blizzard. The Gow School, a residential school in South Wales, NY. Food supplies began to dwindle by Monday, January 31, and so the school's food services had to negotiate with the army for helicopter delivery since the school's own trucks were immobilized by the storm."

        "content": "The high winds of the blizzard packed the snow so tightly and high, drifts reached 30\u00a0ft (9\u00a0m) in places;[110] normal snow removal equipment was ineffective, and earth-moving equipment, such as front-end loaders, had to be used.[51] Colonel Daniel Ludwig of the USACE stated the \"snow was very densely packed and that snow plows would be virtually useless on most of the roads\".[111] NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker noted on one of the roads near the NWS forecast office, high lifts were used \"to dig away at it and break it up like big hunks of rock\".[112] In Depew, a suburb of Buffalo, volunteer firemen used a trenching machine to get people out of a house that had been drifted shut.[113] The long cleanup period included the railroads,[114] who used front-end loaders to clear snow from the rail yard into open-bodied rail cars and shipped it east by Conrail.[115][50] Sixteen of 25 towns in Erie County, as well as the City of Buffalo, declared states of emergency and banned all nonessential traffic at some time during the storm.[108] The USACE normal work force, plus personnel from other USACE installations, resulted in a total of 353 USACE personnel working on the recovery effort.[116] The USACE Buffalo District overall effort (including both western and northern New York) reported $6.8\u00a0million used in paying 216 private contractors to plow 3,186\u00a0miles of road in 9 counties using about 1,000 pieces of equipment and US$700,000 of in-house costs.[117][118] Other military assistance included 500 National Guard troops, 320 U. S. Army Airborne troops, the 20th Engineer Brigade from Fort Bragg, 65\u201370 U.S. Marines, as well as assistance from the U.S. Air Force.[119] The National Guard operation was entitled Task Force Western, with headquarters at the Connecticut Street Armory in Buffalo, and included providing 9\u201310 Army-type ambulances along with operators for use in the City of Buffalo when almost no normal ambulances were able to operate.[120] The Salvation Army fed between 67,000 and 176,000\u00a0people, provided clothing for about 4,500, and housed 851, for a cost of US$75,000 to US$150,000, using 1,000 volunteers and over 400 snowmobiles.[121][122] A Salvation Army official noted the disaster was unique in that \"it covered 9 counties and nobody could get in\".[123] The American Red Cross distributed 5\u00a0tons (4500\u00a0kg) of food at 84\u201392 locations, feeding about 50,000\u00a0people.[124][118] The total snowfall for Buffalo during the storm was only 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) (Port Colborne in Ontario received 18.3\u00a0in (46\u00a0cm).[36] The blizzard was made unique by the sustained winds, gusting up to 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h), which picked up the snowdrifts piled on the frozen Lake Erie and dumped that snow load in western New York and southern Ontario.[36] The winds were accompanied by Arctic-cold temperatures, making it feel like \u221260\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221251\u00a0\u00b0C) outside[36] Whiteout conditions had trapped people at work, in cars and in homes; some had to stay for a day, while others had to stay for the storm's duration.[36] At the Buffalo zoo, 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) drifts allowed three reindeer to walk over their fence and wander about the city;[36] also, over 20 animals died during the storm.[15] There were 23 total storm-related deaths in western New York, with 11 in the City of Buffalo, plus seven more in the rest of Erie County, three in Wyoming County, and one each in both Niagara and Orleans counties.[3] At least nine were found buried in cars,[36] while others involved heart attacks while shoveling snow, and car accidents.[3] The above-stated death tolls are listed in the USACE report on cleanup efforts in the storm,[3] while a slightly different death toll is listed by the NWS on their Blizzard of 1977 webpage, which indicates 29 deaths resulted from the storm.[36] The Buffalo Area Chamber of Commerce estimated a total economic loss for Erie and Niagara counties combined of US$221,490,000 for the 5.5-day period starting on January 28, with 175,000\u00a0people losing wages of US$36,250,000.[125] An estimated $20\u00a0million or more was spent removing snow,[30] with USACE alone spending over $6\u00a0million on contractors in western New York.[126] Total damage reached $300\u00a0million.[36] For 11 days, national media showed images of a city covered in snow up to roofs of houses.[36] Equipment from Colorado, New York City and Toronto, among others, was used in the cleanup of snow.[127] Abandoned vehicles were towed to designated parking areas, and the snow was hauled to dump areas where some remained until early May.[127] Although March was 8\u00a0\u00b0F (4.5\u00a0\u00b0C) above normal,[122] the snow melted gradually, so there were no significant flooding problems.[128]"

        "header": "Southern Ontario",
        "content": "The entire Niagara Peninsula of Southern Ontario was significantly impacted by the blizzard, although the southern parts of the Peninsula across the Niagara River from Buffalo and extending westward along the northern edge of the frozen, snow-covered Lake Erie were hit the hardest. This was indicated by reports that the worst conditions were limited to closer to the lakeshore than in western New York. For example, compare reports in[129] that conditions were much better 1 to 2\u00a0mi (1.6 to 3.2\u00a0km) inland and reports in[130] from a military commander noting an airborne view made it clear the worst was right along the shore, with reports from western New York with snow near street-light level in well-inland Lancaster.[89]  The hardest hit coastal communities included Fort Erie, Port Colborne and Wainfleet. Areas of Southern Ontario as far away as London to the west, Kitchener to the northwest, and Toronto to the northeast also experienced high winds and blowing snow, particularly on January 28. As with western New York, the southern Niagara Peninsula had experienced a significant amount of snowfall prior to the blizzard commencing on Friday, January 28. Port Colborne had received 136.4 centimetres (53.7\u00a0in) since Christmas and Fort Erie had gotten 103.5 centimetres (40.7\u00a0in) since Christmas, with 17.8 centimetres (7.0\u00a0in) and 27.9 centimetres (11.0\u00a0in) of Fort Erie's amount having fallen on January 26 and 27, and 5.1 centimetres (2.0\u00a0in) and 3.8 centimetres (1.5\u00a0in) of Port Colborne's having arrived those days.[131][132] As stated previously, the storm, with consistent winds of 70\u00a0km/h and gusts of 100 to 120\u00a0km/h, struck suddenly late in the morning Friday, January 28.  The resultant blowing snow causing zero visibility and drifting snow making roads impassable causing many vehicles becoming stuck in the snow, causing their occupants to abandon them.[133][134] That day 16.5 centimetres (6.5\u00a0in) of additional snow fell in the Port Colborne-Wainfleet area.[135] That night, 250\u00a0people were stranded in the International Nickel Company plant in Port Colborne.[136] Although schools closed when informed of the impending storm, the rapid onset of the storm resulted in about 1,000 students being stranded overnight on January 28, in Port Colborne and Wainfleet schools (about 2,000 students total were stranded in the Niagara region altogether).[137] On Saturday, January 29, 10.2 centimetres (4.0\u00a0in) more snow was deposited in Port Colbourne-Wainfleet area and the high winds continued to cause blizzard conditions and high drifts of snow.[138] That night, at 6 p.m., 800 students were still trapped, with 600 of them in Wainfleet and Port Colborne.[137] On Sunday, a day when the winds decreased until the mid-afternoon but an additional 11.7 centimetres (4.6\u00a0in) of snow fell, the remaining students were taken from the schools with the help of the militia; some students were housed in nearby houses.[139] In some areas, buses had become stranded trying to take children home from school Friday, so bus drivers had taken the children to nearby houses.[140] On Monday, January 31 a further 8.1 centimetres (3.2\u00a0in) of snow fell in Port Colborne and windy conditions caused more blowing snow and higher snow drifts.[138] Looting of radios from abandoned cars, as well as looting of soda pop from a truck was reported.[141] The Long Beach and the Lowbanks areas of Wainfleet were very strongly affected by the storm.[142] In Wainfleet, one resident reported early in the storm the wind broke a window facing the lake and snow rapidly began drifting in the house, which caused significant damage.[143] In the Lowbanks area, a resident reported the storm smashed in windows and collapsed doors; they had lost power and heat and were burning furniture in the fireplace to keep warm.[144] Ontario Hydro noted some power outages lasted 72\u00a0hours; it took an average of 24\u00a0hours to get power restored for some larger customers.[145] The depth of drifts in the hardest hit areas was extreme. Snowmobilers reported passing over vehicles, as well as onto the roof of a house, without knowing it,[146] and snowmobiling over the top of a school bus without being able to see its roof.[147] In the Long Beach area, snow reached the power lines, with people stepping over and rolling under them, and only the chimneys of houses were visible above the snow.[148] Along the lakeshore in Wainfleet, the mayor reported drifts up to 45\u00a0ft (14\u00a0m),[149] and in Lowbanks, a military officer reported drifts of 30 to 40\u00a0ft (9 to 12\u00a0m) with only the steeple of a church visible.[2] One drift estimated at 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) remained until June 1,[150] while snow banks reportedly lasted until the first week of June in the Cedar Bay area.[151] Snowmobiles were widely used to deliver aid and provide transportation. Niagara Regional Police Service enlisted the help of 60 snowmobiles and 15 four-wheel drive vehicles for use for regular police calls, as well as to deliver food and medication.[152] Snowmobiles were also used to transport doctors and nurses,[153] and Ontario Hydro workers.[154] In Fort Erie, where the storm deposited 12.7 centimetres (5.0\u00a0in), 30.5 centimetres (12.0\u00a0in), 11.2 centimetres (4.4\u00a0in) and 11.2 centimetres (4.4\u00a0in) of snow on the four days, snowmobiles were being dispatched from all six fire halls to provide aid.[155] Citizens band (CB) radio operators were used by the Niagara Regional Police for communication.[153] The radio station CHOW facilitated communication by allowing people to call in and air needs on the radio,[156] a role confirmed via a plaque from the Port Colborne Chamber of Commerce and scrolls from the Welland Chamber of Commerce.[157] The Canadian Forces assisted in the situation under police direction.[158] For example, the mayor of Port Colborne requested military assistance from the Emergency Measures Organization in St. Catharines that resulted in an Army Reserve Battalion being sent and militia assisting in searching for stranded motorists.[159] In a deployment headquartered at the Regional Police Station in Niagara Falls and stationed at the Lake Street Armoury in St. Catharines and the Niagara Falls Armoury in Niagara Falls, 156 reserves militia and 9 regular force soldiers helped in disaster relief.[160] Regional authorities requested military assistance in the afternoon of January 29, and the first unit was called at 3:30 pm, with 130 employed in the operation by the next morning.[160] Their initial priorities were to \"preserve life, clear main arteries into the communities of Port Colborne and Fort Erie, and try to open Highway 3 between Port Colborne and Fort Erie\".[161] Farmers in Wainfleet dumped milk since it could not be transported out, and they also had trouble getting feed to their animals.[162] The snow was difficult to plow; one road, near the lakeshore, could not be opened with a big front-end loader or a large bulldozer; instead, a small bulldozer with a bucket took 2.5\u00a0days to clear about 300 yards (270\u00a0m) of road.[163] One resident noted they were snowed in for 19\u00a0days before being plowed out on February 14.[164] One effect of the prolonged confinement at home many people experienced in the fall of that year was a marked increase in births at local hospitals (almost 18% in Regional Niagara in Canada).[165] Other cities on the Niagara Peninsula, such as St. Catharines Thorold, Niagara Falls, Welland and Dunnville were significantly impacted, while Hamilton was not hit as badly by the storm.[166] Dunnville, 20\u00a0km west of Wainfleet, experienced piercing snow from the late morning onward, resulting in the schools closing before lunchtime; the cars of some teachers who stayed for a couple hours to ensure all the students were picked up, got stuck in snow drifts not far from the school so they were stranded overnight.[167] Snowmobile services were set up at certain locations around the town and the Ontario Provincial Police transported the teachers and other stranded people home one-by-one by snowmobile Saturday night and Sunday.[167] The airport closest to Dunnville, in Simcoe 50\u00a0km to the west, recorded consistent winds of 50\u00a0km/h and blizzard conditions (blowing snow and visibility of 0.2\u00a0km or less) for the whole afternoon of January 28, and very low visibility for much of January 29 (0.4\u00a0km to 0.8\u00a0km) and for most of January 31 (about 0.6\u00a0km).[168] St. Catharines, situated on the north side of the Niagara Peninsula on the shore of Lake Ontario, had winds between 50 and 70\u00a0km/h with blowing snow causing low visibility/almost blizzard conditions (0.4\u00a0km visibility) the entire afternoon of January 28, and had winds between 40 and 60\u00a0km/h and reduced visibility (approximately 0.8\u00a0km) most of January 29, and variable reduced visibility (ranging from 0.4\u00a0km to 1.2\u00a0km) for much of January 31, before the winds and blowing snow curtailed on February 1.[169] Winds gust were as high as 98\u00a0km/h on January 28 and 93\u00a0km/h on January 31 leading to wind chill temperatures of -16.9 C and -14.6 C on those days, while 8.8\u00a0cm of snow was distributed on the city on January 28 and with lower amounts between 0.5 and 1.5\u00a0cm on the other days of the blizzard.[169] Hamilton had blizzard conditions of blowing snow and visibility between 0 and 0.4\u00a0km from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and semi-blizzard conditions (visibility about 0.8\u00a0km) for most of the evening on January 28 with total snow of 4.5\u00a0cm and peak wind gusts of 89\u00a0km/h.[170] London, Ontario, experienced consistent winds of about 50\u00a0km/h which caused blowing snow and near zero visibility (0.2\u00a0km or less) for the entire afternoon of January 28 even though only 6.9 centimetres (2.7\u00a0in) of new snow was deposited that day.[171] Consistent winds of 35 to 40\u00a0km/h continued over three of the next four days, resulting in drifting and blowing snow causing reduced visibility (between 1 and 1.6\u00a0km) for almost all of January 29, low visibility (between 0.6 and 1.2\u00a0km) for almost all of January 31, and reduced visibility (between 1.2 and 1.6\u00a0km) for several hours on February 1, although only 6.9 centimetres (2.7\u00a0in) additional snow fell over the four days.[171] The military, with reserves plus a 900-man infantry battalion,[172] was called in to assist clearing snow drifts and stranded people in the London area, but conditions there were not as serious as the southern Niagara Region, with four wheel-drive vehicles being generally sufficient for transportation.[130] Kitchener had 3 hours of blizzard conditions (0 to 0.4\u00a0km visibility) the afternoon of January 28 with wind gusts up to 81 Km/h even though its total snow was only 5.7\u00a0cm that day.[173]"

        "content": "Portions of northern New York state, particularly Jefferson and Lewis counties, were also hard hit. At 3:10 pm, on Friday, January 28, Watertown reported zero visibility and wind gusting to 28\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h)[174] as the cold front that had moved through southern Ontario and Western New York advanced through northern New York. The Watertown region received 8 to 12\u00a0in (20 to 30\u00a0cm) of snow with the cold front, but unfrozen Lake Ontario (in contrast to frozen Lake Erie), along with atmospheric conditions favorable for lake effect snow, allowed snow bands to form that resulted in storm totals of 66\u00a0in (168\u00a0cm) in Watertown, 72.5\u00a0in (184.2\u00a0cm) in Mansville, 93\u00a0in (236\u00a0cm) Fort Drum, and more than 100\u00a0in (254\u00a0cm) in areas southeast of Watertown.[1] The snow, along with the winds, resulted in drifts of 15 to 30\u00a0ft (5 to 9\u00a0m), and stranded of more than 1,000 motorists.[1] After beginning with the cold-front passage at 3:10 pm on January 28 at Watertown, the blizzard's winds peaked at 49\u00a0mph (79\u00a0km/h) at 7:00 pm.[174] That night, about 150\u00a0people were stranded at the Chesebrough-Pond factory in Watertown.[175] Three radio announcers at radio station 1410 AM WOTT in Watertown were stranded without food, and each of them worked 8-hour shifts to keep the station on 24\u00a0hours per day, playing music and taking hundreds of calls from North Country residents in need of services, such as fuel, food or reassurance. Jefferson County Sheriff's deputies brought the announcers provisions via snowmobile on the fifth day of their entrapment. Oddly enough, though the snow was piled up over the roof of the studios on Gifford Road, the morning announcer's VW Bug parked next to the building was totally clear of snow, thanks to prevailing winds. It took him over 5\u00a0hours to travel the 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) to his home in Brownville, as only one lane was clear on several of the roads he traveled. During the storm, a Radio Emergency Associated Communication Teams (REACT) CB team set up at the plant to coordinate help for those needing things such as medical assistance,[176] The Red Cross also set up at the factory,[177] and snowmobiles and four-wheel drive vehicles were dispatched.[178] After a lull at Watertown, the storm restarted at 2:30 am on January 29, and lasted until 10:00 pm. This portion of the storm included gusts to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and heavy snow.[174] The storm then abated at Watertown, but at 2:00 pm on Sunday, visibility returned to zero. By midnight Sunday, 34\u00a0in (86\u00a0cm) of new snow had fallen since Friday, January 28, at 7:00 am.[174] The blizzard continued throughout Monday, January 31, with an additional 17\u00a0in (43\u00a0cm) of new snow before the snow stopped around 8:00 am on February 1.[174] Due to the lower wind speeds than those that occurred in western New York, the snow in northern New York was not as hard packed according to Ben Kolker of the NWS office in Buffalo.[110] Northern New York did have significant snowfall, though, along with significant drifting. On February 1, Jefferson and Lewis counties were among the counties added to the initial federal emergency declaration,[76] and on February 5, were among the counties declared major disaster areas.[103] The New York District of the USACE assisted with snow clearing by having contractors clear a total of 450\u00a0mi (720\u00a0km) of roadway in Jefferson and Lewis counties.[126] U.S. Marines were at Camp Drum (near Watertown) for cold-weather training, and some of them assisted in Jefferson and Lewis counties with fourteen 25-ton Amtrack vehicles,[119] The National Guard assisted with track vehicles; U.S. Army troops from Camp Drum also helped with disaster relief.[119] Since food and supplies were in short supply in the area by the end of the storm, on February 1, the travel ban was lifted from 7:00 am until noon so 1,900 stranded travelers could leave the area.[179] Agricultural interests were adversely affected by the storm, with the dairy industry hardest hit due to farmers' inability to get milk to market.[180] In Jefferson County alone, about 85% of dairy farmers were forced to dump milk because tank trucks could not reach farms. This contributed to $8\u00a0million in agricultural losses.[125] Other problems included barns collapsing from the snow (seven in Jefferson County), feed and grain shortages, disposal of manure, and farmers being unable to reach barns to feed cattle.[181] Five deaths were reported in northern New York as a result of the storm, all due to heart attacks (four occurring while shoveling snow and another in his car).[3] At the end of the blizzard period on February 1, a National Weather Service spotter at Barnes Corners, Lewis County, measured a snow depth of 108\" on the level. Anecdotal reports from eastern sections of the Tow of Lorraine, Jefferson County, which was close to the area of heaviest snowfall, estimated snow depths of ten feet.[182] On February 9, about a week after the storm ended, the average snow depth in the Black River basin (about 2,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (5,200\u00a0km2)) which include Jefferson, Lewis and other counties was 40.4\u00a0in (102.6\u00a0cm), having a liquid equivalent of 8.06\u00a0in (205\u00a0mm) that raised flooding concerns.[183] Sears Pond, about 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) southeast of Watertown, recorded a snow depth of 77.3\u00a0in (196\u00a0cm) with a liquid equivalent of 19.23\u00a0in (488.4\u00a0mm).[183]"

        "content": " Hurricane Bertha was an unusual tropical cyclone in early August 2014 that attained hurricane status, despite having a disheveled appearance and an abnormally high atmospheric pressure. The third tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the season, Bertha developed from a tropical wave south of Cape Verde was monitored first for possible tropical cyclogenesis on July\u00a026. Over the following days, it slowly developed and acquired gale-force winds and enough convection to be designated as Tropical Storm Bertha early on August\u00a01. A mostly disorganized cyclone, Bertha quickly moved across the Lesser Antilles, clipping the northern end of Martinique, later that day. During its trek across the eastern Caribbean Sea, its circulation became severely disrupted and it may have degenerated into a tropical wave. On August\u00a03, it traversed the Mona Passage and moved over the Southeastern Bahamas where conditions favored development. Despite an overall ragged appearance on satellite imagery, data from Hurricane Hunters indicated it intensified to a hurricane on August\u00a04; it acquired peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) that day. Turning north, and later northeast, Bertha soon weakened as it began to merge with an approaching trough to the west. This merger ultimately took place on August\u00a06, at which time Bertha was declared extratropical well to the south of Nova Scotia. The remnant system raced eastward across the Atlantic and later struck the United Kingdom on August\u00a010. Once over the North Sea, the storm stalled for a few days before resuming its eastward track. It was last noted around the Baltic Sea on August\u00a016. As a tropical cyclone, Bertha's impact was relatively minor. Widespread power outages occurred along its path but no major damage or loss of life took place on land. Enhanced swells and rip currents associated with the hurricane resulted in three fatalities and dozens of rescues along the East Coast of the United States. After becoming an extratropical system, it had significant effects in Western Europe. Particularly hard hit was the United Kingdom, where wind gusts reached 108\u00a0mph (174\u00a0km/h). Unseasonably heavy rains triggered widespread flooding which shut down roads and prompted evacuations. One fatality took place offshore. On mainland Europe, a small tornado outbreak resulted in scattered structural damage in Belgium, France, and Germany."

        "content": "On July\u00a024, 2014, a westward moving tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa near the Cape Verde Islands. Following the development of convective activity \u2014showers and thunderstorms\u2014 on July\u00a026, National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system for potential tropical cyclogenesis.[1][2] A disorganized system, development was forecast to be slow due to unfavorable environmental conditions.[3] Organization and coverage of convection began improving by July\u00a028, due in part to the passage of a Kelvin wave.[1][4] An area of low pressure subsequently consolidated within the disturbance on July\u00a029 and the NHC assessed the system as having high chance of becoming a tropical depression.[5] Convection soon diminished over the system, though its circulation remained well-defined.[6] Moving west-northwest around the periphery of a strong subtropical ridge,[7] the low acquired tropical storm-force winds early on July\u00a031 but continued to lack convection.[8] A hurricane hunter aircraft investigated the system that afternoon and found winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) north and northeast of the center. In the hours following the weather reconnaissance mission, a band of deep convection blossomed near the center, prompting the NHC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Bertha at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a01. Upon its classification, Bertha was situated roughly 345\u00a0mi (555\u00a0km) east-southeast of Barbados in the Lesser Antilles.[1][7] Within hours of Bertha's designation on August\u00a01, wind shear stemming from a trough over the central Atlantic displaced convection from the circulation center.[1][9] Satellite imagery depicted a well-defined and vigorous circulation; however, observations from the hurricane hunters indicated a wind field more akin to a tropical wave.[10] Around 21:00\u00a0UTC, Bertha clipped the northern end of Martinique with sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[11] Persistent shear continued to take its toll on the cyclone as it entered the Caribbean Sea with aircraft data indicating no closed circulation at 5,000\u00a0ft (1,500\u00a0m) elevation. Despite this, observations from Martinique and Dominica indicated that there was some semblance of a surface circulation, and the NHC continued to monitor Bertha as a tropical storm.[12] Throughout August\u00a02, convection steadily increased in coverage and organization though the center of Bertha remained displaced from the strongest thunderstorms to the southwest. NEXRAD weather radar imagery from San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a disorganized, possibly open circulation throughout the day. In light of this, NHC forecaster John Beven noted that the system could degenerate into an open wave around the time in reached Hispaniola later on August\u00a02.[13] Continued effects of dry air entrainment, shear, and land interaction further degraded Bertha's structure and late on August\u00a02, \"the system\nbarely [qualified] as a tropical cyclone\".[14] Various data sources indicated no closed circulation by 21:00\u00a0UTC and it was noted that advisories could be discontinued, at least temporarily.[14] Early on August\u00a03, the disheveled storm moved through the Mona Passage and brushed the eastern coast of the Dominican Republic before emerging over the Atlantic Ocean.[15] As the storm moved away from Hispaniola its movement became more northwesterly, following the edge of the subtropical ridge.[16] Moving near the Turks and Caicos Islands,[17] Bertha's circulation finally became better organized and banding features developing over its eastern periphery.[18] At 14:00\u00a0UTC, Bertha made landfall on Middle Caicos Island with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[1] Subsequent strengthening of upper-level outflow, decreased shear, increased mid-level humidity, and high sea surface temperatures enabled rapid intensification.[1] Deep convection wrapped cyclonically into the storm and winds reached 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) by 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a04.[19][20] During the early part of August\u00a04, structural organization began to degrade with convection becoming more limited in extent and banding features dissipating. The only factor aiding the storm was its well-defined outflow. However, despite the storm's ragged and weak appearance, observations from hurricane hunters indicated that it had intensified into a hurricane by 12:00\u00a0UTC.[1][21] Bertha is estimated to have reached its peak intensity around this time with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.47\u00a0inHg).[1] Additionally, by this time its movement had shifted to due north and with increased forward momentum.[21][22] Through the remainder of August\u00a04 and into the early hours of August\u00a05, Bertha maintained hurricane status with its atypical structure. At times, its circulation became exposed due to increasing wind shear.[23] Acceleration to the north-northeast ahead of a trough off the East Coast of the United States ensued as the system weakened below hurricane intensity during the overnight of August\u00a04\u20135.[24] Steadily increasing wind shear kept the circulation center mostly devoid of thunderstorms, with periodic bursts of convection being quickly pushed away. The storm's motion became more northeasterly early on August\u00a06 as it began to undergo an extratropical transition.[25] An upper-level jet streak coupled with the system that morning, prompting convection to develop away from the storm's center.[26] Bertha soon merged with the trough steering it northeast as it moved into the cold sector of the front, which extended from Nova Scotia to The Bahamas. The merger of these systems marked Bertha's transition into an extratropical system,[27] at which time it was located 290\u00a0mi (470\u00a0km) south-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia.[1] Slight intensification took place shortly thereafter with winds increasing to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) before weakening resumed. The system raced eastward across the Atlantic and ultimately degraded into a trough several hundred miles southwest of Ireland on August\u00a09.[1] Bertha's remnants struck the United Kingdom the following day and later moved over the North Sea.[28] There, the storm stalled for a few days before resuming its eastward track.[29] The decaying cyclone moved over Scandinavia on August\u00a014 and was last noted on August\u00a016 near the Baltic Sea.[30][31][32]"

        "content": "Late on August\u00a01, Bertha crossed the Lesser Antilles, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to many islands. Across Martinique, the storm produced sustained winds of 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h).[1] Numerous lightning strikes caused widespread surges in the electrical grid and left 150,000\u00a0residences without electricity. Power was restored to all customers by the evening of August\u00a02.[33][34] Rainfall was relatively light and less than anticipated with 1.2 to 2.4\u00a0in (30 to 60\u00a0mm) falling across northern areas of the island and 0.39 to 0.79\u00a0in (10 to 20\u00a0mm) over southern areas.[35] Similar effects were felt in Guadeloupe where gusts reached 57\u00a0mph (92\u00a0km/h) on La D\u00e9sirade. A general 3.9 to 5.9\u00a0in (100 to 150\u00a0mm) fell across Basse-Terre Island. Few reports of downed trees and power lines were received and overall damage was negligible.[36] Some rain and wind also affected Barbados.[37] Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit declared a public holiday for the afternoon of August\u00a01 in order for all workers to return home in advance of the storm.[38] Several LIAT flights for the island and St. Lucia were canceled.[37] Wind gusts on Dominica reached 43\u00a0mph (69\u00a0km/h) and hundreds of people lost power.[1][33] Coincidentally, Bertha threatened the United States Virgin Islands 18\u00a0years after a hurricane in 1996 of the same name, with both affecting the primary elections.[39] Turnout was low as expected due to the storm, with 9,217\u00a0people (26.05\u00a0percent) of voters showing up to polls.[40] In response to the storm, the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency was activated, leave for all police officers was suspended, and officers began operating on 12-hour shifts on August\u00a01. The Public Works Department appropriated sandbags and cleared storm drains in anticipation of heavy rain.[39] The outer edges of Bertha produced near-hurricane-force around the United States Virgin Islands, with an offshore buoy near St. Thomas measuring a gust of 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h). Gale-force winds on St. Croix snapped many tree limbs.[33] Across Puerto Rico, the outer bands of Bertha dropped a general 3 to 5\u00a0in (76 to 127\u00a0mm) of rain,[33] with isolated areas reaching 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm), over areas suffering from a drought.[41] Accumulations peaked at 11.11\u00a0in (282\u00a0mm) in Adjuntas.[1] Some flooding occurred on the island, resulting in the partial collapse of two roads.[41] The R\u00edo Grande de Arecibo topped its banks between highways 10 and 123 within the Utuado Municipality.[42] Landslides blocked a few roads around Aceitunas.[43] Tropical storm-force wind gusts, peaking at 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h),[1] downed some trees and power lines.[44][45] Prolific lightning accompanied the storm and resulted in 29,000\u00a0residences losing power.[33] In Arroyo, 239\u00a0people, mostly athletes, sought refuge in public shelters.[46] Following the designation of Tropical Storm Bertha on August\u00a01, the Ministry of Public Works and Communications in the Dominican Republic activated emergency operations to prepare for the storm.[47] Several flights to and from Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport near Santo Domingo were canceled on August\u00a02.[48] Heavy rains in the country, peaking at 4.7\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) in Bayaguana,[1] caused significant flooding, especially along the Soco River which overflowed its banks. The communities of Atilano, Cabeza de Toro, Campi\u00f1a, Concho Primo, and Lima, were temporarily isolated by the rising waters. Less substantial flooding occurred elsewhere in the country, with seven homes inundated in Mosc\u00fa. Additionally, strong winds downed many trees in the region.[49] Across the Southeastern Bahamas, residents were warned of the approaching storm; however, many were preoccupied with a local regatta and ignored warnings.[33] In the Turks and Caicos, locals brought their boats closer to shore and anchored them. Hotels were reportedly \"taking seriously the threat of the storm.\"[50] Increased surf and sporadic heavy rains associated with Bertha affected portions of Cuba.[51]"

Thirty shops were affected and nearby stations of the London Underground were swamped.[70] The Prudential RideLondon race was shortened by 14\u00a0mi (23\u00a0km) due to the storm.[70] The River Dee rose to its highest level since 1990 and flooded surrounding areas. Footbridges and paths along its banks were washed away, though no structures were affected.[72] Lossiemouth, Scotland, received a month's worth of rain in roughly 12\u00a0hours. Flooding in Elgin prompted the evacuation of 200\u00a0homes. Numerous roads were washed out across Scotland and First ScotRail reported widespread service disruption.[73] High winds and flooding also damaged crops across the region, namely in Scotland.[74] A Gold Duke of Edinburgh expedition team from 1st Raffrey Boys' Brigade were forced to airlift a crew member to safety after sustaining injuries caused by severe weather conditions in the Mournes. The team of five, part of a larger group of thirty, required the assistance of a helicopter from Dublin to save the fallen traveller and winched him to safety. Although scarred, the team went on to complete the expedition in record time. Offshore, a man suffered a fatal head injury on his yacht amid rough seas and high winds. The Solent Coastguards flew out to rescue the man, but he was declared dead on the scene.[75] Twenty vessels competing in the 2014 EXE Sails GP14 World Championships were caught in high winds produced by the storm and capsized in the Strangford Lough. A nearby hospital declared a major incident and the coast guard rushed to rescue the 97\u00a0sailors stranded in the water. Only one person suffered injuries, but all were treated for hypothermia.[76] The outer bands of Bertha's remnants produced a prolonged period of severe weather over mainland Europe, extending from France to Sweden.[77] In southwest Germany, gusts reached 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[78] On August\u00a010, a small tornado outbreak occurred with touchdowns taking place in Belgium, France, and Germany. The strongest of these, rated F2 on the Fujita Scale, affected Bad Schwalbach, Germany; 50\u00a0homes were damaged in the area and a swath of forest was heavily damaged. An F1 tornado struck an outdoor event in Luxembourg, Belgium, resulting in four serious injuries. Additionally, an EF1 storm traveled for 25\u00a0mi (41\u00a0km) through the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France. Another tornado, rated F0, touched down in Kingston upon Hull, United Kingdom, on the same day.[77][79] Alerts were raised across Norway for the potential of flooding and damaging winds.[80]"

Peak rainfall and flooding is between August and September.[1] The level of the Nile has risen rapidly to the highest level of the last 70 years because of the persistent heavy rains.[2] The Nile level continues to rise and reached a crucial phase in the capital Khartoum. As of 23 August, the level of Nile stands at 16.42 meters, where the critical stage is 16 meters and flooding 16.5 meters.[3] According to reports, more than 4,800 livestock have been lost and nearly 5,100 hectares of land have been damaged or destroyed. This could lead to food production being hampered and contributing to high food prices and lead to a deterioration in food security, exacerbating an already perishing food emergency.[4][5] Torrential rains destroy the roads to rural areas, cutting off supply lines in need of humanitarian assistance.[6] Alongside the floods, Sudan is in a situation of political turmoil and economic crisis, among other things. The government was taken control of via military coup by Sudanese military, which is led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on 25 October 2021.[7] More than hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced since this military coup, with severe political, economic and social crises, heavy rains and floods occurring at the same time. The army was compelled to dissolve the transitional government of Abdalla Hamdok, in order to help reduce human casualties and economic losses.[8] But floods and coups still seriously exacerbate Sudan's economic crisis.The flood has contributed billions of dollars of economic damage to the people of Sudan.[8][9]"

About 50,000 abandoned cars and 800 Chicago Transit Authority buses littered the streets and expressways.\"[7] Other sources estimate 20,000 cars and 1,100 buses stranded in the blizzard.[8] Gusts of 48 to 53 miles per hour (measured at Midway Airport) caused large snowdrifts to accumulate.[8] Thunderstorms occurred and several funnel clouds were sighted during the blizzard.[8] The blizzard closed both Midway Airport and O'Hare Airport. Ten-foot drifts covered the runways at Midway. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley ordered city workers to clear city streets around the clock and asked citizens for help.[7] On Friday, the city was virtually shut down and area schools were closed.[6] Chicago's fleet of 500 snow plows and 2,500 workers was out in force, and additional snow removal equipment was sent from Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan.[8] Many of the south suburbs of Chicago reported that their snow plowing equipment failed during the blizzard, and recommended people stay home on Friday, as recorded in a collection of local radio news reports from the first day of the blizzard.[2] Although the city was on the move again by Tuesday, it took the city of Chicago three weeks to plow all the streets of snow, as it did not warm up enough for the snow to melt away.[9] In 2017 as the 50th anniversary of the blizzard neared, people looked back on their own stories of the first day, how long it took some to get home, up to six hours for a usual half hour trip, and how some did not get home for one to two days, staying in their car, in a local tavern. One woman decided to walk home from her downtown job, and she said, \"People were helping each other \u2014 it was wonderful. People were stopping in cars that could get through, and they would take you a certain distance,\" she said. \"Back then, you could trust people to take you where you wanted to go. You never thought twice about getting in and letting them give you a ride home.\"[4] Some sources consider this blizzard to have been \"paralyzing\" to the city, and the greatest disruption in the city since the Chicago Fire of 1871.[3][10] Plowing was rendered ineffective as the snow fell because the blizzard winds blew the snow back on the freshly plowed roads, stranding vehicles on expressways and arterial streets alike.[10] The storm affected the metropolitan Chicago area, with the heaviest snow falling from the west side extending east to northwest Indiana, as far as LaPorte.[11] Rockford, northwest of Chicago, had a few inches of snow, while far southeastern Wisconsin (Lake Geneva down to Kenosha) registered 6-10 inches of snow.[11]"

This record would be surpassed just three seasons later, when the 1969-70 winter dropped 77.0 inches (195.6\u00a0cm) of snow on the city.

The fourteenth tropical storm, record-breaking tenth tropical cyclone, and ninth intense tropical cyclone of the 2018\u201319 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kenneth formed from a vortex that the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office on La R\u00e9union (MFR) first mentioned on 17 April. The MFR monitored the system over the next several days, before designating it as Tropical Disturbance 14 on 21 April. The disturbance was located in a favorable environment to the north of Madagascar, which allowed it to strengthen into a tropical depression and later a tropical storm, both on the next day. The storm then began a period of rapid intensification, ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 934 hPa (27.58 inHg). At that time, Kenneth began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle and weakened slightly, before making landfall later that day as an intense tropical cyclone.[2] As a result of land interaction, Kenneth became disorganised as it made landfall and rapidly degenerated thereafter. The storm then shifted southward, with the MFR cancelling all major warnings for inland cities. Kenneth was reclassified as an overland depression after landfall, with the MFR issuing its warning at midnight UTC on 26 April. Thunderstorm activity developed off the coast of Mozambique on 27 April as the system began drifting northward. Kenneth re-emerged off the coast of northern Mozambique on 28 April, before dissipating on the next day. In the country of Comoros; Kenneth's wind and rainfall caused at least seven deaths. Damage was estimated at US$345\u00a0million.[3] Prior to Kenneth's landfall, local authorities evacuated over 30,000 people in the path of the storm in northern Mozambique.[4] Kenneth killed 45 people in Mozambique."

        "content": "On 17 April, the MFR began monitoring a vortex to the north of Madagascar.[5] The MFR continued to monitor the system over the next several days, noting a significant increase in deep convection on 21 April.[6] On 22 April at 12:00 UTC, the MFR began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Disturbance 14.[7] Soon after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, noting that the disturbance was located in a favorable environment with low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F).[8] Early on 23 April, the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 24S.[9] A few hours later, the MFR upgraded the system to a tropical depression while it was moving west, under the influence of a low-to-mid-level ridge located to the south.[10] The MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm at 12:00 UTC, assigning the name Kenneth to the storm. At that time, the MFR stated that cloud top temperatures had decreased to \u221290\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212130\u00a0\u00b0F) and that the overall organization of the system had improved.[11] Soon after being named, Kenneth began to rapidly intensify, with the JTWC noting that a formative eye feature had developed.[12] Around 00:00 UTC on 24 April, the MFR upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm.[13] A few hours later, the JTWC followed suit, upgrading Kenneth to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[14] At 12:00 UTC, Kenneth was upgraded by the MFR into the record-breaking tenth tropical cyclone of the season. At that time, the MFR stated that an eye was attempting to form within the central dense overcast of the storm, and that wind shear was beginning to decrease.[15] Around 18:00 UTC, Kenneth strengthened into the equivalent of a Category\u00a03 major hurricane. At that time, the Hahaya International Airport on the Comoros island of Grand Comore reported winds of 36 knots (67\u00a0km/h; 41\u00a0mph) while Kenneth was located about 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) to the north.[16] Six hours later, the MFR upgraded Kenneth to intense tropical cyclone status, noting that the storm had a very cold convective ring and that the core had become more compact.[17] On 25 April, at 06:00 UTC, Kenneth reached peak intensity, with 10-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 934\u00a0hPa (27.58\u00a0inHg). At that time, Kenneth had a pinhole eye surrounded by very strong convection; however, the storm also began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle.[18] Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated that Kenneth peaked as a Category\u00a04-equivalent tropical cyclone, with 1-minute sustained winds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[19] As Kenneth approached the Mozambique coastline, the system slowly began to weaken due to the eyewall replacement cycle and the frictional effects of land interaction. Later that day, at 13:15 UTC, Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique as an intense tropical cyclone, just north of Pemba, with 1-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane.[20] This made Kenneth the most intense landfalling tropical cyclone in the recorded history of Mozambique.[2] This also marked the second time in Mozambique's recorded history in which two storms have made landfall during the same cyclone season at intense tropical cyclone intensity or higher.[4] After landfall, Kenneth was re-classified as an overland depression, with 10-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), just below intense tropical cyclone strength. As the storm drifted further inland, it rapidly degenerated.[21] Shortly afterward, the JTWC issued its last warning on the system. Kenneth's central convection had drastically shrunk, with only a small area remaining over land.[22] Despite still being in a favorable atmospheric environment, Kenneth continued to rapidly weaken due to interaction with land. At 00:00 UTC on 26 April, the MFR issued its last warning on Kenneth, reporting 10-minute sustained winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), while the system was located about 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) inland in Mozambique.[23] Kenneth continued to weaken, with its winds falling below gale force as it continued its southward motion. On 27 April, thunderstorms developed off the coast of Mozambique, although the center of Kenneth remained over land, as the system began drifting northward.[24] On 28 April, Kenneth emerged off the coast of northern Mozambique, but continued to weaken due to unfavorable conditions. Subsequently, Kenneth dissipated by 12:00 UTC on 29 April.[25]"

Flooding was most severe in Katherine, Northern Territory, where flooding began 24 January. Many residents were evacuated to cyclone shelters, while several others were stranded on rooftops. On Australia Day, 26 January, roads north and south from Katherine were closed due to rising floodwaters, and Royal Australian Air Force personnel from RAAF Base Tindal joined local police and emergency services to assist with sandbagging critical infrastructure. Some 5000 residents were evacuated as an estimated 500 businesses and 1200 homes were inundated by floodwaters, including the Katherine District Hospital.[4] On 27 January, a state of emergency was declared for Katherine as the Katherine River reached a level of 20.3\u00a0m (66.6\u00a0ft). The floodwaters peaked at 20.4\u00a0m (67\u00a0ft) at the Katherine railway bridge, passing the previous record of 19.3m during major flooding in 1957.[4] Two days later, 392 residents were evacuated from the Daly River region, approximately 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) downstream from Katherine, where floodwaters had risen above 11.5m and would continue to rise to a peak of 16.8\u00a0m (55\u00a0ft) on 3 February.[3] The cyclone dumped over 380mm of rainfall in the area within a 48-hour period, leaving water up to 2\u00a0m (6.5\u00a0ft) through much of the town. The flooding forced at least 2,000 people out of their homes, and killed 3 people.[5] Total damages from the storm amounted to at least A$100\u00a0million (US$64.7\u00a0million).[1] Additionally, local infrastructure was severely damaged by the storm. During the flood emergency, the only road access between Darwin and the rest of Australia was impassable for five days.[6] Drainage and sewerage systems failed, leading to an outbreak of gastroenteritis.[7] When the flood waters receded, priority was given to making critical facilities such as the hospital operational once again, with 300 additional Australian Defence Force personnel arriving to assist with the clean-up.[8]"

It was expected this amount would be met by the Commonwealth Government.[9] The Northern Territory Government conducted studies in the area in the years following the disaster to learn how better to prepare for major flood events, and now makes flood maps and information brochures available to the public[10] as well as other early warning systems such as flood sirens and live webcams monitoring the river. On 30 January, Prime Minister of Australia John Howard visited Katherine,[4] announcing measures including disaster relief payments of $1000 for each adult and $200 for each child affected by the flooding, the creation of a taskforce to investigate problems faced by those who were not insured for flooding as well as $5 million in funding for repairs and improvements to the Stuart Highway.[8] The economic impact of the disaster on the town of Katherine was significant. Of the estimated $200 million damages, only $70 million was insured and many local businesses were forced to close. The pastoral industry, worth over $60 million[7] annually to the region was badly affected by the loss of whole herds of livestock to the rising waters.[11] A study conducted by the School for Social and Policy Research at Charles Darwin University in 2008 analysed trends in census data before and after the disaster and found that the population had not yet recovered to pre-flood levels ten years after the event, and the demographics in the town had shifted significantly.[12] In 2008, the Katherine Town Council submitted to Infrastructure Australia documents outlining the approximate costing and importance of relocating the town's hospital and ambulance station to a less flood-prone area following the total evacuation and inundation of both facilities during the 1998 and 2006 flood events.[13]"

It was one of the largest Chicago snowstorms in history at the time, with 21 inches (53\u00a0cm) of snowfall in the two-day period.[1] Only 2 inches (5.1\u00a0cm) to 4 inches (10\u00a0cm) of snow was expected[2] but by the end of Sunday, January 14, the depth of snow on the ground peaked at 29 inches (74\u00a0cm).[3] The blizzard lasted for a total of 38 hours. At its peak, wind gusts reached speeds of  39 miles (63\u00a0km) per hour.[4]  Five people died during the blizzard, with approximately 15 others seriously injured due to conditions created by the storm. One of the five deaths came when a snowplow driver went berserk, hitting 34 cars and ramming a man.[3] O'Hare Airport was closed and all flights were grounded for 96 hours, from January 13 to 15.[3] The cold weather and snowfall throughout the rest of January and February resulted in frozen tracks throughout the Chicago 'L' system.[3] Consequently, commuters overwhelmed the capacity of CTA buses, causing bus commutes that normally would have taken 30 to 45 minutes to take up to several hours. To avoid huge snowdrifts in the streets, the overcrowded buses were obliged to take numerous detours, adding additional time to the commute.[citation needed]"

The city's inadequate response to the blizzard was blamed primarily on mayor Michael Bilandic, who had assumed the post after the 1976 death of Richard J. Daley.[5][6] Newspaper articles at the time blasted Bilandic. Jane Byrne, Bilandic's main opposition in the Democratic primary, capitalized on this and defeated Bilandic in the February 27 primary, eventually becoming the first female mayor of Chicago.[5][6]"

        "header": "Damage",
        "content": "The damage in Port Elizabeth was primarily due to the inadequate capacity of Baaken's River to handle the intense rainfall, despite its relatively small catchment area. Although the stream's catchment area covered only about 10 to 15 miles with a width of 3 to 4 miles, much of the destruction occurred in \"reclaimed\" land. The city experienced a rainfall of 3.25 inches,[2] which alone was insufficient to explain the rapid transformation of a small stream into a 200-yard-wide and 20 to 30-feet-deep raging torrent within two hours. The floods even overcame a 150-feet-wide and 40 to 50-feet-deep gorge. The sudden rise of water gave people little time to escape, and some had to swim to safety, but a mule was fortunate enough to be washed onto the roof of the municipal stables while others perished. The water level rose six feet in just five minutes, and debris from an upper bridge obstructed the main bridge, diverting even more water through the town. The floodwaters stripped the maize fields down to the ploughed depth, and all trees and bushes were swept away for about a mile along the river.[3] The flood caused significant destruction as it surged through the town, particularly in the produce section. The main stream followed Commerce Street, cutting off the Customs House located 250 yards from the river. Numerous buildings collapsed and extensive property damage occurred, with entire stores demolished and their contents, including produce and merchandise, scattered for miles along the North End Beach. The Harbour Board plant and the Port Elizabeth Electric Tramway power station also suffered serious damage.[4] The flood washed away the railway bridge at the Creek, causing disruption to the train service between Zwartkops and the town. However, repair crews swiftly worked to establish a system where trains ran to each side of the break, allowing passengers to transfer between them.[4] The watershed of the Papenkuils River was also affected, causing damage in the Cradock Place area. The residents of Cradockstown faced devastating destruction as the heavy rainfall lasted for four hours almost continuously, causing immense damage to previously fertile agricultural lands. The powerful water swept away thousands of bundles of forage and wood that had been prepared over the past two weeks, as well as mature longstanding oak trees on the property were uprooted and carried a significant distance away.[4]"

        "content": "In September 1909, individuals impacted by the flood damage took legal action against the Council and the Commissioner of Public Works.[5] On 13 September, the Circuit Court began hearing the case. The plaintiffs were merchants who had incurred losses in the flood, claimed that the low bridge and raised roadway caused insufficient opening for floodwaters, and buildings should never have been allowed on the flood plain. The Council was found not liable initially, but the merchants appealed the decision,[6] and brought the case known as \"Tilbrook & Bayley v. the Town Council of Port Elizabeth and the Colonial Government.\" The plaintiffs claimed that the Town Council's actions caused the floodwaters to be diverted into buildings where their goods were stored. The alleged wrongful and negligent acts included reclaiming parts of the river bed, constructing a roadway across the river with an inadequate opening for floodwater discharge, and building a low-height bridge with oblique supports.[2] On 9 March 1910, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on the case. The Court determined that even if a lagoon still existed, it would not have significantly affected the flood's course, as it was the most severe flood on record. Regarding the bridge, the Court ruled that public bodies were not responsible for every possible emergency and that the bridge was designed appropriately based on foreseeable circumstances. The appeal was dismissed, and the plaintiffs were required to pay the costs.[2] Following the litigation, the Port Elizabeth Municipality sought advice from a conference of engineers, who provided their opinions on 27 May 1910. The conference, unable to determine the original river channel conditions, recommended a 100-feet wide channel to accommodate any reasonable flood. They presented three alternative schemes, with the municipality ultimately adopting the \"BB\" scheme, proposing a channel length of approximately 1,600 feet.[2]"

The Cuba\u2013Florida hurricane devastated both regions, resulting in at least 318\u00a0fatalities and damage exceeding $100\u00a0million. A hurricane which struck Mexico in late September caused between 200 and 300\u00a0deaths in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec due to flooding.

Three of those hurricanes intensified into major hurricanes.[1] The season included the first instance of upper-atmosphere data via radiosonde being successfully incorporated into tropical cyclone track forecasting for a fully developed hurricane, which occurred as the Cuba\u2013Florida hurricane approached Cuba.[5] Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the 1944 Atlantic hurricane season caused approximately $202\u00a0million in damage and at least 1,025\u00a0fatalities.[6][7][8][9] Tropical cyclogenesis is believed to have begun with Hurricane One on July\u00a013. Two other tropical cyclones formed in July.[2] Four systems developed in August, two tropical depressions, a tropical storm, and a hurricane \u2013 the Jamaica hurricane. The month of September featured the most activity, which included a tropical depression, three tropical storms, and three hurricanes. One of the hurricanes, the Great Atlantic hurricane, became the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 918\u00a0mbar (27.1\u00a0inHg). During October, a subtropical depression, two tropical depressions, and two hurricanes developed. November featured a tropical storm and a subtropical depression, the latter of which was absorbed by a frontal system on November\u00a014, marking the conclusion of cyclonic activity for the season.[10] The season's total activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 104, the highest total since 1935. ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

The storm produced hurricane-force winds in coastal New York, including in New York City, as well as waves up to 6.4\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) above mean low tide. A total 117\u00a0homes and 272\u00a0buildings were destroyed and 2,427\u00a0homes and 852\u00a0suffered some degree of structural impact. In Connecticut, the hurricane demolished 60\u00a0residences and 500\u00a0buildings, while causing damage to 5,136\u00a0dwellings and 4,550\u00a0other structures. Rhode Island observed hurricane-force winds and tides up to 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) above mean low tide at the city of Providence. Within the state, the cyclone wrecked 23\u00a0homes and 368\u00a0buildings and damaged 5,525\u00a0homes and 7,597\u00a0buildings. Massachusetts reported similar conditions, especially near the coast. The hurricane destroyed 230\u00a0homes and 158\u00a0buildings and inflicted some degree of damage to 3,898\u00a0homes and 915\u00a0buildings. Overall, the hurricane caused about $100\u00a0million in damage and 46\u00a0deaths on land in the United States. Additionally, at least 344\u00a0people were killed at sea due to maritime incidents relating to the storm. The largest number of deaths occurred when the USS Warrington sunk about 450\u00a0mi (725\u00a0km) east of Vero Beach, Florida, leading to the deaths of 248\u00a0sailors.[7] In Canada, the Atlantic provinces reported some wind damage to buildings, homes, and trees, as well as power outages. One person died in Nova Scotia due to electrocution.[8]"

The extratropical remnants moved northward, before merging with the Icelandic Low near Greenland.[9][10] The hurricane proved to be an important test of the American radiosonde network, whose upper-atmosphere data were successfully incorporated into tropical cyclone track forecasting, the first such instance on record.[5] Squally conditions battered the Cayman Islands for three days, destroying every crop on the islands;[14] the 31.29\u00a0in (795\u00a0mm) of rain recorded on Grand Cayman was the highest in the island's history.[15][16] At least 300\u00a0people were killed in Cuba, though the full extent of casualties remains unknown as reports from rural areas of the island were never compiled.[9] In Havana, numerous buildings were damaged.[17] A weather station in Havana documented a 163\u00a0mph (262\u00a0km/h) wind gust, which stood as the strongest gust measured in the country until Hurricane Gustav in 2008.[18] Crops suffered extensively, exacerbated by the hurricane's timing near optimal harvest time.[19] Total damage in the state amounted to $63\u00a0million,[9] with about $50\u00a0million attributed to crop damage.[19] Eighteen deaths were reported in the state and 24\u00a0others were hospitalized.[9] Heavy rains and gusty winds were felt throughout the Eastern Seaboard from the hurricane and its extratropical remnants,[11][20] causing widespread power outages.

Another depression developed from a tropical wave over the southeast Caribbean Sea near the Windward Islands on August\u00a026. The depression moved westward and is believed to have dissipated quickly, though this might be due to a lack of observations. On September\u00a018, a reconnaissance aircraft flight confirmed the development of a tropical depression over the northeastern Caribbean. The depression moved northwestward, crossing the Virgin Islands on the following day. After entering the open Atlantic north of the islands, the depression dissipated east of the Turks and Caicos Islands on September\u00a021.[10] Weather maps and data indicate that a tropical depression formed just east of the Lesser Antilles on October\u00a013. The depression entered the Caribbean and later crossed the Mona Passage, a strait between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, on October\u00a015. By the following day, the depression dissipated near the southeastern Bahamas. A frontal low-pressure area developed into a subtropical depression on October\u00a020, far to the southwest of the Azores. The subtropical depression moved slowly northward and dissipated by the following day. On October\u00a025, a tropical depression formed over the northwestern Caribbean. Dissipation likely occurred on the next day. The next cyclone, and the final system of the 1944 Atlantic hurricane season, developed from a frontal low east-northeast of Bermuda on November\u00a013.

An EF3 tornado also damaged houses in Pawnee Rock, Kansas, and completely destroyed farm homes near Great Bend, injuring one person. Hail up to 4 inches (10\u00a0cm) in diameter and straight-line winds up to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) were also reported on May 16.[4] On May 17, individual storm cells began to pop up along a line from Minnesota to Nebraska. The individual storm cells generated a few tornadoes in Iowa, Nebraska, and Minnesota before converging into a squall line. The squall line continued to produce winds of up to 89\u00a0mph (143\u00a0km/h) in parts of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois before weakening below severe limits. An EF2 tornado embedded in the squall line ripped the roof off of a house and injured one person near Galva, Illinois.[5] On May 18, a high risk of severe thunderstorms was issued for south-central Kansas and northwestern Oklahoma. The Storm Prediction Center stated that several intense and long-tracked tornadoes, along with hurricane-force winds and hail up to 4 inches in diameter were likely in the high risk area. Also, a 30% risk of tornadoes including significant tornados was issued in the high risk area. In the early afternoon, a line of intense supercells with baseball size hail fired along the dry line near the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle border. A few of these supercells went on to produce multiple scattered, short-lived tornadoes across three different states. Most were weak, though an EF2 tornado crumpled several metal power line truss towers near Haynesville, Texas. Later in the afternoon when the most intense severe weather was forecast to occur, a stationary front set up in northern Kansas lowering temperatures in most of the moderate and high risk areas. This led to insufficient instability and limited the severe weather in southern central Kansas and West central Oklahoma to smaller hail and winds. However, this also created a large plume of heavy precipitation that caused some flash flooding. In addition, the supercell thunderstorms that formed during this event initiated in the early afternoon, well before the best kinematics for tornado development had arrived. Later in the evening, the tornado threat was limited to central Texas and eastern Oklahoma. A large, slow moving high precipitation supercell with softball sized hail set up near Cross Plains, Texas. This storm was tornado warned for over an hour and produced many funnel clouds along with a couple of weak tornadoes. The main threat with this storm however was the flash flooding as it dumped close to 8 inches (20\u00a0cm) of rain in localized areas due to its very heavy rain and slow movement. A squall line progressed through eastern Oklahoma and Kansas overnight, producing many embedded tornadoes, two of which reached EF2 intensity. One of these EF2 tornadoes struck Muskogee, Oklahoma, causing severe damage to trees, apartment buildings, and industrial buildings. A separate EF1 tornado impacted the western part of Muskogee as well, causing damage to homes and businesses, and downing many trees. The squall line continued into Friday morning, eventually making its way to parts of Arkansas and Missouri, producing numerous additional weak tornadoes. Other storms in states further to the west also produced many EF0 and EF1 tornadoes. On May 20, the severe weather threat generally was limited. However, a few weak tornadoes were spawned in Indiana as plentiful helicity and the presence of a warm front aided the development of tornadoes. Overall, this outbreak sequence produced 134 tornadoes.[6]"

        "content": "This rain-wrapped, multiple-vortex EF3 wedge tornado was the longest-tracked tornado in Wisconsin state history. It moved through rural areas in the northwestern part of the state, producing an 82.53-mile long path of damage through four counties. The tornado touched down in Polk County, several miles east of Clear Lake, very close to the Polk/Barron County line. The first point of damage occurred at a farmstead, where structures sustained EF0 damage and sheet metal was tossed into a field. The tornado then quickly crossed into Barron County. Further to the northeast, some trees were downed and another farm sustained EF0 damage, with barrels being rolled out into a field and a pole barn having its doors blown in. Continuing along an east-northeasterly path through rural areas of the county, the tornado reached EF1 intensity, snapping and uprooting many trees and striking several farms. Sheds and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, with sheet metal thrown and wrapped around trees and pieces of lumber speared into the ground. Two silos were sheared off as well. The tornado then widened and began moving in a more due-easterly direction, reaching EF2 strength as it crossed the Red Cedar River. Outbuildings were completely destroyed, a house had its roof torn off, many trees were snapped, and several other homes and a warehouse building sustained heavy roof damage in this area. Several mobile homes were destroyed further to the east before the tornado crossed US 53 northeast of Chetek. High-end EF2 damage occurred in this area as the Prairie Lakes Estates mobile home park sustained devastating damage. Numerous mobile homes were completely destroyed at this location, with large amounts of debris scattered throughout a nearby wooded area. Structural debris, furniture, clothing, and appliances were strewn throughout the park, and several vehicles were damaged or destroyed. Many trees were snapped and denuded in this area as well. One person at Prairie Lakes was killed and several others were injured, some critically. The tornado then struck a nearby turkey farm, where several large turkey barns were completely flattened with the debris strewn downwind, killing at least 25,000 turkeys. Several wooden power poles were snapped in this area as well. The tornado maintained high-end EF2 strength as it crossed Prairie Lake, where a wide swath of trees was flattened and several lakeside cottages sustained total roof loss and collapse of exterior walls. Weakening to EF1 strength and resuming a more northeasterly path, the tornado then crossed Mud Lake, snapping many more trees and causing mostly minor damage to numerous RVs, mobile homes, and lakeside homes. Past Mud Lake, several rural properties and farmsteads were struck at EF1 intensity, with outbuildings and garages destroyed. In Barron County alone, 40 homes were destroyed, 45 were heavily damaged, and 75 others sustained minor damage. Four businesses were destroyed, and two others were damaged.[158][159] Maintaining EF1 strength, the tornado continued into Rusk County and destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings and downed many trees. An isolated pocket of EF2 damage occurred several miles east of the Rusk County line, as a frame home had its roof ripped off and a nearby detached garage was completely destroyed. Debris was blown into a nearby wooded area, along with a large metal propane tank. EF1 damage continued through rural areas of the county, with countless trees snapped or uprooted, many outbuildings damaged or destroyed, and homes sustaining roof damage. A silo had its metal top blown off, and cabins sustained damage at Amacoy Lake. Past Amacoy Lake, many additional trees were downed and more outbuildings were damaged or destroyed. As the tornado approached the small village of Conrath, it re-strengthened back to EF2 intensity. A large barn was completely destroyed, a detached garage was swept away, and a manufactured home was damaged in this area. As the tornado passed just north of Conrath, it reached its maximum intensity. A poorly-anchored home was completely leveled at EF3 intensity in this area, with only a pile of rubble left behind. Nearby trees were snapped and denuded as well. Past Conrath, the tornado rapidly weakened back to EF1 strength as it continued to the east, damaging or destroying outbuildings and downing numerous trees. In Rusk County, one home was destroyed, three were severely damaged, and 21 sustained minor damage. Damage along the remainder of the path and into Price County consisted entirely of EF0 level tree damage. The tornado dissipated to the west-southwest of Ogema. The tornado reached a maximum width of 1,320 yards and killed one person. 25 others were injured.[160][161]"

Upper-level winds prevented tropical cyclogenesis of the system.[15] However, the low had characteristics of a subtropical cyclone, with a closed atmospheric circulation and extensive convection extending to the northeast of the system. The interaction between the low and a high pressure area over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean produced winds of around 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) across the region.[14] The system moved slowly across the Greater Antilles.[14] By early on May\u00a024, the low was located south of Haiti and was interacting with a tropical wave.[16] Later that day, the system moved over southwestern Haiti,[17] crossing into the Bahamas by May\u00a025.[18] Later that day, the National Hurricane Center briefly noted the possibility of the system developing into a tropical cyclone, noting its well-defined circulation. Although there was a lack of convection near the center, there was a potential for the shear to diminish.[19] However, by late on May\u00a026, the system no longer had a chance for development after it began moving quickly to the northeast.[20] By May\u00a027, the system was located about 190\u00a0mi (305\u00a0km) east of Bermuda, connected to a trough that extended to Hispaniola.[21]"

Short-term direct impacts mainly include leptospirosis and acute respiratory infections (ARI). Short-term indirect impacts are a result of two main modes of transmission being water-borne: diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A, and vector-borne: diseases from intermediate species that carry disease pathogens, such as mosquitoes. Vector-borne diseases brought on by flooding include dengue fever and malaria. In addition, displacement and eventual overcrowding can lead to fungal infections of the lungs and skin. The long-term health impacts of the Caribbean floods are mainly in the form of mental health problems. The experience of surviving a flood disaster can affect people for years. Anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), confusion and insomnia are some of the common mental health problems that occur after a flood disaster. In addition, not only the health of communities that have experienced flooding is at risk. Disaster relief workers, healthcare workers and key service providers may also be affected. As the flooding occurred in 2004, there is a lack of data in this area, so this direction will not be discussed. In the longer term, chronic illness, disability, poor mental health and poverty-related illnesses, including malnutrition, are potential legacies of the floods.[48]"

During this period, targeted investments in high-priority vulnerabilities can lead to no-regret outcomes of high environmental and economic benefits.[49] Structural and non-structural measures This is mainly due to the steady increase in population and economic activity in flood-prone areas.[50] The consequences of flooding in the Caribbean are severe because of the exponential increase in urbanization of floodplains, unregulated, human-induced degradation of watersheds, lack of emergency preparedness and resilience, persistent poverty, inefficient public policies and infrastructure problems.[51] The scientific community can work to use advanced methods and techniques to reveal and understand the dynamics and trends of flooding. This will help scientists, politicians and water managers or authorities to develop appropriate policies and measures to prevent and mitigate the effects of flooding. To assess flood risk and prepare mitigation and adaptation measures, structural measures such as policy and economic functions (from low- to high-income countries) need to be compared with non-structural measures and forward-looking consideration of future climatic conditions.[52][53] The following measures should be considered: (1) strengthening the use of machine learning methods and new satellite imagery products to improve flood prediction and flood warning systems; (2) identifying the role of vegetation in flood occurrence; and (3) establishing adequate, cost-effective structural and non-structural flood prevention policies and measures.[citation needed]"

Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October\u00a011. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear for most of its lifetime, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October\u00a012. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October\u00a013. A few tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in anticipation of Fay's impact on Bermuda. Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda. Winds gusting over 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) clogged roadways with downed trees and utility poles, and left a majority of the island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm damaged its roof and sprinkler system. Along the coast, the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats. Immediately after the hurricane, 200\u00a0Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger Hurricane Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage. Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season.[2]"

        "content": "Hurricane Fay originated in a disturbance calved from a mid- to upper-level trough over the east-central Atlantic.[3] On October\u00a07, a broad region of showers and thunderstorms formed around it, possibly enhanced by moisture from a tropical wave to the south. Tracking westward, the energy coalesced into an upper-level cold-core low on the following day, and an associated trough formed at the surface. Southwesterly wind shear initially hindered development, but as the system became more vertically aligned on October 9, the hostile winds calmed. In turn, a curved banding feature was able to take form.[3] Early on October\u00a010, satellite imagery indicated that the center of circulation had become better-defined, with a swath of deep convection to the north and west of the low.[4] It became a subtropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a010,[3] though it was not named \"Fay\" until later that day, after initially being classified Subtropical Depression Seven.[4] Its involvement with the upper-level low and wide radius of maximum winds precluded designation as a fully tropical cyclone.[4] Immediately after forming, the storm moved northwestward around the periphery of a ridge of high pressure in the central Atlantic. As Fay moved away from its parent upper low, wind shear once again increased.[3] The National Hurricane Center originally expected the cyclone to remain weak,[4] but Fay began organizing more quickly than anticipated. Relatively strong winds sampled by a Hurricane Hunters aircraft necessitated a special off-hour advisory to raise the cyclone's intensity estimate.[5] The storm started to acquire characteristics of a fully tropical system, and despite strong southerly wind shear preventing thunderstorms from developing near the center,[6] Fay's wind speeds steadily increased. Upper-level air divergence from the nearby non-tropical low may have contributed to the storm's resilience.[3] After convection became more symmetrical and the wind field contracted, Fay transitioned into a tropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a011.[3] At the same time, the system turned toward the north around the central Atlantic ridge,[7] soon gaining an easterly component to its movement. Fay remained heavily sheared, with the deepest convection still displaced from the center.[8] Forecasters originally believed Fay to have only briefly been a hurricane, but post-season reanalysis revealed that the system had actually strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane by early on October\u00a012 and maintained that strength for 12 hours. The upgrade was confirmed by buoy and land observations and weather radar data. At 08:10\u00a0UTC, the cyclone made landfall on Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), the hurricane's peak intensity. Fay was the first hurricane to make landfall on the island since Emily in 1987.[3] Its satellite presentation improved as a mid-level eye feature formed,[9] though the system remained lopsided. Fay then accelerated toward the east-northeast ahead of a shortwave trough to the north, which also acted to further enhance shear in the area. The hurricane finally succumbed to the persistent wind shear when the low-level center decoupled from the mid-level low and became elongated.[3] By the early morning hours of October\u00a013, Fay started transitioning into an extratropical cyclone as it entered a baroclinic environment and ingested colder, drier air.[10] The circulation rapidly deteriorated; consequently, the NHC issued its last operational advisory on the system at 21:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a012.[11] Early the following day, the storm degenerated into an open trough, ending its existence as a tropical cyclone. Shortly after, the system became reestablished as a frontal cyclone, which lost its definition over the northeastern Atlantic on October 15.[3]"

Additionally, in response to the storm's unexpected strengthening, a hurricane watch was posted at 21:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a011.[3] As it was a Sunday, all public schools on the island were closed.[12] Bus and ferry services were canceled,[13] and two cruise ships delayed their arrival into port to avoid the cyclone.[14] Fay produced unexpectedly strong winds across Bermuda, especially over western and southern parts of the territory. L.F. Wade International Airport reported 10-minute sustained winds of 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h). Several stations at higher elevations recorded gusts in excess of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), reaching 123\u00a0mph (198\u00a0km/h) at Commissioner's Point, about 150\u00a0ft (46\u00a0m) above sea level.[3] The most intense winds occurred in a relatively quick burst on the backside of the storm, within a large band of thunderstorms that affected the island a couple hours after the official landfall.[3][13] Local radar imagery indicated possible tornadic activity coinciding with the period of most damaging winds, though this could also have been an artifact of radar velocity folding.[15] A gauge at St. George's recorded a 1.78\u00a0ft (0.54\u00a0m) storm surge, though higher water rises may have affected the southern and western sides of the island.[3] Rainfall unofficially amounted to 3.70\u00a0in (94\u00a0mm) as reported by a member of the public, and the airport recorded 1.87\u00a0in (47\u00a0mm) of rain, though the observing equipment was compromised in both cases.[3] The hurricane brought down thousands of trees and tree limbs, making streets impassable.[15][16] The winds also toppled utility poles and inflicted roof damage on buildings.[12][17] Over 27,000\u00a0of the Bermuda Electric Light Company's 36,000\u00a0customers lost power at the height of the storm.[18] Several roads, including Front Street in Hamilton, were flooded.[12] Many boats up to 60\u00a0ft (18\u00a0m) in length broke free from their moorings and were damaged or destroyed upon being driven aground.[19] Hamilton city parks sustained considerable damage, and were closed due to safety hazards.[20] The combined effects of Fay and Gonzalo forced the Botanical Gardens and Arboretum to stay closed until mid-November, while cleanup of vegetation damage was underway.[21] Fay damaged the roof of the airport's terminal building, causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information. The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport was closed to all flights, though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non-commercial flights.[22] Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2\u00a0million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.[23] Overall, the cyclone's effects were greater than anticipated, with destruction at least partially facilitated by saturated soils from nearly 14 inches (360\u00a0mm) of rain in August and above-normal precipitation in September.[3] Farmers reported that much of their autumn and winter crops had been lost, along with a few head of livestock.[24] Fay and Gonzalo had a significant cumulative impact on Bermuda's agriculture and fishing industries, contributing to a slight GDP decline.[25] By about a week after Fay's landfall, a local insurance company had received nearly 400\u00a0claims resulting from the storm, accounting for $3.8\u00a0million in damage.[26] However, with several insurers on the island, the actual damage total was likely much higher;[3] in a report to the World Meteorological Organization, the Bermuda Weather Service speculated that all insurance claims from Fay totaled \"tens of millions of dollars\".[15][nb 1] Ten people suffered minor storm-related injuries, but no fatalities were attributed to the storm.[12]"

The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies.[27] Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage.[28] On October 13, crews of soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners.[29] Early on October 16, the Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) switched its focus from service restoration after Fay to preparations for the onslaught of Gonzalo, leaving about 1,500 households without power. The remaining affected customers were asked to refrain from calling in to report outages, as further repairs would not be attempted before Gonzalo's passage unless \"an easy fix can be made [and] resources are available\".[30] With the same 1,500 customers still without electricity by October 23, BELCO tasked several crews with restoring the residual Fay outages on a priority basis,[31] aided by Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation linemen who arrived in the aftermath of Gonzalo.[32] Following the two hurricanes, service was not completely restored to the island until November 3;[15] BELCO ultimately spent $2.9\u00a0million on system repairs, having replaced 228\u00a0utility poles and over 4\u00a0mi (6.5\u00a0km) of wire.[33]"

Over the last week of October 1991, a large storm system over the Atlantic Ocean (1991 Perfect Storm) blocked most of the weather patterns over the eastern half of the United States, and in turn, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico was funneled straight northward over the affected region. By the time the precipitation stopped falling, many cities in the eastern half of Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin had witnessed record early-season snowfall accumulations, while parts of southern Minnesota and northern Iowa were crippled by a large ice storm. Arctic air that was pulled southward behind the storm had combined with the heavy snow pack to produce many record low temperatures. Between the blizzard and the ice storm, 22 people were killed and over 100 were injured."

        "content": "The 1991 Halloween Blizzard developed from a strong arctic cold front that pushed south and east through the central United States several days prior. On October 28, temperatures to the east of the cold front were above normal. High temperatures reached into the 70s from the middle Mississippi River Valley south into northern Texas, and into the 80s across much of central and southern Texas. Meanwhile, high temperatures remained below 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C) Fahrenheit across most of Montana and Wyoming. The contrast between the two air masses was stark, and by the morning of October 29 the cold front was about halfway through Texas. At 6\u00a0am CST, the temperature in the western Texas city of Amarillo had dropped to 22\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22126\u00a0\u00b0C) with a strong northerly breeze. Farther east in Texas, the temperature was 64 in Dallas \u2013 a 42-degree temperature difference over about 300 miles (480\u00a0km). In the northern United States, morning lows were much colder. Temperatures were in the single digits across Montana and Wyoming and in the teens in North Dakota and South Dakota. By October 30, the cold front had pushed east to the Texas shoreline with the Gulf of Mexico, and stalled in that location. As an upper-level shortwave trough approached the Southern Plains, it aided the development of an area of surface low pressure along the sharp temperature gradient near the Texas Gulf Coast. The development of low-pressure systems along coastal fronts in this fashion is relatively common in the cool season along the Texas Gulf Coast and along the Atlantic Seaboard near the Gulf Stream current. From October 30 \u2013 31, this low-pressure system slowly became better organized over Texas, before it ejected north over the Mississippi River Valley. This meridional trajectory of a low pressure track (almost due north from the western Gulf) is climatologically favorable to produce very heavy snowfall in the winter months because it allows copious amounts of moisture to flow north where it can interact with colder air. Cooler readings lingered at the very end of October across the Upper Midwest, and a re-enforcing pool of Arctic air was just beginning to push southeast through the western Canadian Provinces. On November 1, the low-pressure system moved north from western Illinois into the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the minimum pressure fell about 24 millibars in 24 hours, indicative of rapid deepening and strengthening of the cyclone. The low pressure eventually became occluded, weakened, and then continued to dissipate as it pushed east across northern Ontario in subsequent days.[1]"

The snow continued to develop northward, eventually spreading into the Minnesota Arrowhead. Eventually all of the precipitation changed over to snow, and in some areas it would continue falling until November 4."

This not only set a record for the largest amount of snow on that date, but also for the most snow ever recorded in the Twin Cities during the month of October. As the storm system pushed its way northward, more communities in eastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin began to experience similar conditions; and thundersnow occurred as far north as Duluth.[2] Over the next two days the snow continued to fall, leading to additional snowfall of one to two feet (30\u00a0cm to 60\u00a0cm). By the time the snowfall ended on November 4, the storm had dropped 36.9\u00a0in (93.7\u00a0cm) on Duluth, the largest single snow storm total in Minnesota history at that time. The Twin Cities received 28.8\u00a0in (72.1\u00a0cm), setting a single-storm record for the metropolitan area. In all, at least one foot (30\u00a0cm) of snow fell in a swath approximately 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) wide from south central Minnesota, northeastward into northwestern Wisconsin and into the Minnesota Arrowhead.

Ice accumulations as high as 2\u20133\u00a0in (6\u00a0cm\u20139\u00a0cm) were recorded in these areas before the precipitation changed to snow. Up to 10\u00a0in (25.4\u00a0cm) of snow proceeded to fall on top of ice accumulations from the previous day, making travel even more treacherous.[3] Up to 1\u00a0inch of ice accumulation was reported as far south as Omaha, Nebraska.[4]"

Eleven counties in southern Minnesota were declared federal disaster areas, and 52 counties in Iowa were declared disaster areas. At least 100,000\u00a0people lost power because of the weight of the ice downing power lines, and in some cases it took up to a week for the power to be restored.[citation needed] Many roads were closed both from the snow and ice, including long stretches of I-90, I-35 and I-29 in Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota.[5] Highway snow removal was hindered by record cold temperatures that followed the storm and transportation was hampered for many days.[6] Nine hundred schools and business were closed in Minnesota alone.[7] The storm occurred on a Thursday night. Schools in Minong, Wisconsin (40 miles southeast of Superior) were closed even the Monday following the storm.

Following the storm Arctic air poured southward from Canada to produce many record low temperatures in these same areas. Bismarck, North Dakota, sank to \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221223\u00a0\u00b0C) on October 31, breaking their previous record low of 6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214\u00a0\u00b0C) by 16\u00a0degrees.[8] Record snow and cold was recorded as far south as Nebraska and Colorado.[9][10] The Arctic air also spread over Chicago, recording a low of 11 on November 4.[11][12] Four weeks later on November 29 \u2013 30, another large storm system dropped as much as 18\u00a0inches of snow over these same areas.

It tore the roof off St James Cathedral and Sacred Heart Cathedral and severely damaged the Townsville School of Arts and Queen's Hotel.[4] In Townsville, it was reported that \"seven out of every 10 houses between Castle Hill and Eyre St [were] either missing or seriously damaged\".[5] Three Methodist churches were destroyed in Townsville and surrounds alone, with the Baptist and Chinese churches also demolished.[3][6][7][8][9][10][excessive citations] The T. Whalley & Sons stores and offices, formerly the Norman Hall, and nearby Burns Philp & Co. bulk produce store were completely destroyed.[6] In Bowen, many houses were damaged or destroyed, with widespread damage to public and commercial buildings. The Bowen railway station saw most of its buildings unroofed, the Burns Philp & Co. store, Drill Shed and municipal baths were destroyed, with many shops and hotels losing verandahs or roofs.[11] In the town of Ayr, most of the buildings were either destroyed or lost their roofs; the Shire of Burdekin describes both Ayr and Brandon as having been \"substantially demolished\" by the cyclone. Both the historic Burdekin Shire Council Chambers and Ayr Court House suffered major damage.[12][13] On Magnetic Island, the first Picnic Bay Jetty was significantly damaged by the cyclone, necessitating its eventual replacement.[14] The cyclone was named by notable meteorologist Clement Lindley Wragge.[6]"

Road accidents and stuck vehicles further hindered snow removal. On some major highways, traffic slowed to five miles per hour.[24] In West Virginia, on I-77 between Ghent and Beckley, thousands of motorists were stranded for up to 18 hours due to impassable roads.

Floods caused by torrential monsoon rains mostly outside the country in neighbouring Ethiopia raised the Nile River by 17.5 metres (57\u00a0ft) in late August, the highest level it has reached in nearly a century, according to the Sudanese Ministry of Irrigation.[5] For the first time in history, the Pyramids of Mero\u00eb were threatened by flooding.[6] The rates of floods and rain exceeded the records set in 1946 and 1988.[1] Some experts, such as International Rivers, expect climate change to cause periodic bouts of drought and flooding in the future.[7] As of April\u00a02023[update], the farmlands are still flooded as the water hasn't receded.[8]"

        "content": "The Sudanese Security and Defense Council declared a state of emergency throughout the country for a period of three months and has decided to consider Sudan a natural disaster area. The council has formed a supreme committee to prevent and address the effects of torrents and floods,[10] which killed about 100 people and flooded more than 100 thousand homes since late July. The floodwaters may overrun and flood an ancient archaeological site in the country. Teams have organized sandbag walls and are pumping water out of the area in order to avoid damage to the ruins of Al-Bajrawiya, formerly an ancient city of the two-thousand-year-old Meroitic empire and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Previous floods have never affected the site before.[11] The floods have thus far affected more than 500,000 people in at least 16 states across the country. This has left thousands of people homeless. Tents have been put up to accommodate the displaced in Sudan's capital, Khartoum.[12] Water-borne diseases have rapidly increased since the floods. Fever, diarrhea, and stomach infections are rampant as a result of dirty drinking water. Sudan was facing a health crisis even before the flood emergency. Pharmacies have been reporting shortages of medicine, and many hospitals lack adequate equipment.[13] The United Nations has increased food aid to the country while hundreds of thousands of Sudanese have been forced to live in desperate makeshift camps. The situation has been aggravated by the country's economic crisis and political deadlock. The government announced a public emergency after its currency abruptly declined in recent weeks. Prices of basic foods such as bread and sugar have risen in price by over 50 percent over the past few weeks.[14] In September 2020, Sudanese Economic Minister Hiba Mohamed Ali said that the government had dedicated $6.15 million to help alleviate victims of the floods. Furthermore, less than half of the $1.6 billion needed for the country's humanitarian relief plan has been funded thus far.[15] The United Nations said humanitarian actors might run out of funds necessary to continue operations. The country is fighting multiple catastrophes, including warfare and an upsurge of COVID-19 and polio cases. The worst-hit states were North Darfur, Khartoum, Blue Nile, West Darfur and Sennar. In addition, vast areas of arable land in the affected states are flooded. The damage to farms could endanger food security, particularly in Khartoum, where over 1.4 million people are in desperate need of food.[16] On 30 September 2020, the Food and Agriculture Organization said that the floods in Sudan have affected nearly one third of cultivated land and about 3 million people from agricultural households. About 2.2 million hectares of cropland has been flooded and 108,000 head of livestock lost, according to an FAO assessment. Some 1.1 million tonnes of grain was destroyed in planted areas, most of it sorghum, a staple in Sudan, it added. Women from some of the nearly 600,000 affected agricultural households told the FAO they were cutting down to one small meal per day after their sorghum was washed away just before harvest. Commercial crops including bananas and mangos have also been badly hit. The floods have also destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of homes. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said they have affected about 150,000 refugees and displaced people. The United Nations estimates that 9.6 million people face acute food insecurity in Sudan, the highest number on record.[3] In addition, the UN said that severe flooding in South Sudan has forced more than 600,000 people to flee their homes since July.[17]"

Moscow, Idaho recorded 42 inches (110\u00a0cm) of snow in ten days during the second half of January.[5] Prolonged cold settled in following the heavy snow, causing the ground to freeze throughout much of the Columbia Basin and surrounding valleys. In places where the ground wasn't frozen, it was generally saturated with water.[6] In early February, a storm developed near Java and moved eastward. It was picked up by the jet stream and funneled toward the Pacific Northwest, reaching the region as a pineapple express, a name applied to atmospheric rivers observed on the U.S. and Canadian west coast that are sourced in the tropical or subtropical Pacific Ocean. La Ni\u00f1a conditions with a ridge of high pressure over the Rocky Mountains and an Aleutian Low helped to drive the moisture into Washington and Oregon rather than into California.[3][5] The moisture reached Washington and Oregon on February 6 and on the 8th, Seattle observed its wettest February day with 3.06 inches (78\u00a0mm) of rain at the airport.[7][8] With soils in many places either frozen or saturated, water resulting from rain falling on snowpack was unable to seep into the ground, instead remaining on the surface causing flooding.[5]"

It is estimated that flood control infrastructure in the Willamette Valley prevented additional damage around $1.1\u00a0billion (1996 value) in Portland alone.[7] Flooding was common elsewhere.[5]"

Sandbags were placed along the downtown seawall to prevent flooding, but the river came a few inches short of overtopping the lowest sections.[10][11] Further upstream, cities from Oregon City to Corvallis were impacted by rising waters on the Willamette River and Oregon Department of Agriculture was forced to temporarily relocate to a new facility in the Salem area.[7][12] The water reached so high in Oregon City that Willamette Falls almost disappeared.[13] Several rivers flowing west out of the Oregon Coast Range into the Pacific also flooded. The dairy industry in Tillamook County with 500 cattle having drowned and sediment left behind covering about a quarter of the grazing land in the county.[14] Southwest Washington saw significant impacts. Near Centralia and Chehalis, Interstate 5 was covered by up to 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) of water and the dike built to protect the Chehalis-Centralia Airport overflowed. The Skookumchuck River reached a new record high discharge, with the Chehalis River and Cowlitz River also getting well above flood stage.[15] Further south, a mudslide near Woodland also closed Interstate 5.[9] Numerous roads were washed out in King County. One man died when he drove into a 40 feet (12\u00a0m) deep hole left behind when the road he was driving on was destroyed. Parts of Kent and Renton flooded and a landslide caused a house in Tacoma to slide into the Tacoma Narrows.[9] Because of its position between the Puget Sound and Lake Washington, Seattle did not experience significant flooding though the city was unable to draw water from the Cedar River because of the amount of sediment in the river.[16]"

Similar values were recorded near the headwaters of the Naches River, a tributary of the Yakima, with most communities from Nile in the Cascade Mountains to Toppenish taking damage. Visitors to a country club in Yakima were stranded when an ice jam blocked the river and cut off access, requiring military vehicles to be used in the evacuation. Interstate 82 near Granger was closed for flooding, and sediment entering the Naches River from one of its tributaries forced the closure of State Route 410.[17] Near Milton-Freewater to the south of Walla Walla, Mill Creek rose to the point where helicopters had to be used to evacuate people.[18] Four levees in St. Maries, Idaho broke from high water and damage from ice. U.S. Route 95 and U.S. Route 12 were closed in Idaho. Tug boats had to be used on Lake Coeur d'Alene to keep a restaurant boat from floating away from its dock.

He also issued a disaster declaration for parts of the Pacific Northwest. During the flooding, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers used night-vision goggles to watch dikes.[1] Yakima County created a flood control district in 1998 to mitigate flood risk there. Among the projects was the removal of a scrapyard south of Union Gap to expand a bridge allowing for a wider floodplain. Previous to this, floodwaters would get backed up and rush into Wapato and Toppenish as occurred in 1996. Other agencies also made improvements to the Yakima River, including by widening the area between levees and constructing a new bridge for State Route 24, both near Yakima.[17] Environmental groups and scientists in Oregon lobbied for wetland and flood plain restoration along the Willamette River. Existing dams and other infrastructure provided examples of how far flood control in the region had come during the 20th Century, but it was not considered feasible to build more. The Army Corps of Engineers was directed by Congress to conduct a study of how successful such a program would be, which was still ongoing as recently as 2021.[3]"

It dumped heavy snow across the Mid-Atlantic and New England states, from Virginia to Maine through the early evening of February 12, and ended in Atlantic Canada on February 13. The major cities from Baltimore to Boston received at least a foot of snow, with a second-highest amount of 26.9 inches (68\u00a0cm) in New York City, the (at the time) most since at least 1869, the start of record keeping, only broken by the January 2016 United States blizzard nearly 10 years later."

        "content": "Since the heaviest snow was confined to a fairly small, but very heavily populated area, the storm was only ranked as a low-end Category\u00a03 (Major) on the new Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale, which takes into account the area and population affected, as well as snowfall accumulations.[3]  This indirectly also reflects the fact that casualties were extremely low and cleanup was fairly quick, even in the New York City area where the record snow amounts occurred. The main reasons for this are: A) The storm fell on a Sunday when many people can more easily stay home, B) the relatively small geographic area of extremely large snowfall, and C) Because the temperature was well below freezing throughout most of the storm, the snow was mostly dry and light in composition, as opposed to the wet and heavy snows that make some otherwise lesser storms much harder to clean up from and are more common at least in the coastal Northeast. Additionally, temperatures in the days after the storm were unseasonably warm in some spots (reaching the mid-50s \u00b0F in hard-hit New York City, and the mid 60s in DC) which helped melt the snow much more quickly than usual. The storm system began developing on February 11 as a relatively minor system, bringing some snow along the southern Appalachian range. The low pressure center moved off-shore early February 12 before it began its rapid intensification. By early morning, snow began falling heavily, taking several forecasters by surprise who had expected about a foot of snow, at most, along the eastern fringes of the Atlantic seaboard. During the height of the storm on Sunday morning the 12th, thunder and lightning occurred as the snow fell. The extreme intensification was partially the result of a fairly mild winter that kept water temperatures in the Atlantic a few degrees warmer than they normally are in February. The storm system's intensity led to snowfall accumulations upwards of 32 inches (81\u00a0cm) in some localities. In addition to the heavy snow, coastal flooding from storm surge was reported, particularly in Massachusetts.[4] Storm surges have been recorded as high as 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) in parts of New England.[5] The low pressure area began forming in the Southern states a few days prior to the Blizzard striking, eventually merging with a northern stream system. A trough on the East Coast brought the system up the coast, and cold high pressure to the north eventually slowed the system to a crawl. As the system completed bombing, or rapid decrease in central pressure (a common measure of the strength of a storm), mesoscale banding features (areas of significant snowfall associated with smaller scale physical phenomena) impinged on the entire I-95 Corridor. The low pressure center was so deep that somewhat of an eye actually formed. Rarely do eyes form on storms other than hurricanes, and it is especially rare in extratropical cyclones. NASA took a satellite picture of the eye of the storm; the eye was located south and east of southern New Jersey in this picture."

A total of 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) fell in the small Sandy Hook village.[8] West Hartford totaled 27 inches (69\u00a0cm) and Fairfield saw 27.8 inches (71\u00a0cm) of snow. Despite the large amounts of snow, there were only isolated individual power outages. At the storm's onset, governor M. Jodi Rell ordered all tractor-trailer trucks off the state's highways to facilitate the efforts of highway crews with snow removal. Motorists whose vehicles were not equipped with 4-wheel drive were required to use snow chains to travel on state roadways during the storm. Connecticut mobilized 2,500 state-owned and privately contracted snowplows to keep state highways open during the storm. The state's 169 cities and towns employed hundreds of additional plows to keep local roads passable.

Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport) were closed during the record blizzard, for the first time since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Like the Blizzard of 1996, this winter storm does not meet the criteria to be called a blizzard, however. The winds were not strong enough, and visibility was not poor enough. Thundersnow, which is a rare occurrence in New York, occurred for about a 4-hour period in parts of The Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Rockland and Westchester during the height of the storm early Sunday morning. Central Park received 26.9 inches (68\u00a0cm) of snow, the largest amount for a single storm since records began, breaking the record of 26.4 inches (67\u00a0cm) that fell on December 26, 1947. By comparison, the blizzards of 1996 and 2003 dropped 20.2 and 19.8 inches (51 and 50\u00a0cm) in Central Park respectively. The smallest amounts of snowfall were recorded in portions of Nassau County, including the towns of Oceanside, Lynbrook, Rockville Centre and Island Park.\nThe snow removal cost in New York City alone is estimated at $27\u00a0million.[14] It took nearly two days for utility crews to fully restore service to as many as 300,000 customers.[11] The storm did not reach very far north of the city; the Albany area only received 1\u20132 inches (3\u20135 centimetres) of snow. As a result, the 2005\u201306 winter season ended up being the first time ever since records began in the late 19th century that New York City received more snow than Albany in a given winter (the inland, upstate city averages about twice as much snowfall per winter as its big neighbor to the south). The strong winds downed trees and powerlines, resulting in $3\u00a0million in damage (2006\u00a0USD).[12]  The Long Island Rail Road reported extensive delays and as many as eight trains disabled up to several hours after the blizzard. The Monday morning commute was no better, as two of the railroad's lines were shut down completely and delays caused headaches for ambitious commuters. By Tuesday, two days after the storm, service was back to normal.[15] Despite the record snowfall, New York City schools were open on February 13, owing to planning and work by the city and its snowplow team."

        "content": " Tropical Cyclone Alibera was the third longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record in the south-west Indian Ocean, with a duration of 22\u00a0days. It formed on December\u00a016, 1989, well to the northeast of Madagascar. For several days, it meandered southwestward while gradually intensifying. On December\u00a020, Alibera intensified to tropical cyclone status with 10\u2011minute maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. That day, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office in R\u00e9union (MFR) estimated 10\u2011minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), an unofficial warning agency for the region, estimated peak 1\u2011minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). After drifting erratically for several days, the storm began a steady southwest motion on December\u00a029 as a greatly weakened system. On January\u00a01, Alibera struck southeastern Madagascar near Mananjary, having re-intensified to just below tropical cyclone status. It weakened over land but again restrengthened upon reaching open waters on January\u00a03. The storm turned to the southeast, then to the southwest, and finally back to the southeast, dissipating on January\u00a05. Early in its duration, Alibera produced gusty winds in the Seychelles. Upon moving ashore in Madagascar, the cyclone lashed coastal cities with heavy rainfall and up to 250-km/h (150-mph) wind gusts. In Mananjary, nearly every building was damaged or destroyed, and locals considered it the worst storm since 1925. Across the region, the cyclone destroyed large areas of crops, thousands of houses, and several roads and bridges. Alibera killed 46\u00a0people and left 55,346\u00a0people homeless. After the storm, the Malagasy government requested for international assistance."

        "content": "The first named storm of the season, Tropical Cyclone Alibera, formed on December\u00a016 about halfway between Tromelin Island and Diego Garcia as a tropical disturbance.[1] It originated from the Intertropical Convergence Zone and initially consisted of a spiral area of thunderstorms.[2] The system moved erratically, first to the southwest, then to the southeast, and later curving back to the west,[1] steered by a ridge to the southeast.[2] On December\u00a018, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office in R\u00e9union (MFR) estimated that the system attained winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), making it a moderate tropical storm.[1] The MFR is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin.[3] As a result, the Mauritius Meteorological Service named the storm Alibera.[2] Also on December\u00a018, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), a joint United States Navy and Air Force task force issuing cyclone warnings for the region, assessed that the storm had winds equivalent to a minimal hurricane in a post-storm analysis.[1] While the storm was active, however, the JTWC did not begin advisories until the following day.[4] Alibera quickly intensified, attaining tropical cyclone status on December\u00a020 while southwest of Agal\u00e9ga. Although the MFR estimated 10\u2011minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) that day, the JTWC assessed that the storm was vastly stronger, estimating peak 1\u2011minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[1] This is equivalent to a super typhoon, which made Alibera tied for the strongest cyclone in the southern hemisphere that season, along with Cyclone Alex in the Australian basin.[4] On December\u00a021, Alibera turned sharply to the south and slowly weakened. On the next day, the storm curved to an eastward drift as a downgraded severe tropical storm,[1] its path influenced by ridges to the east and west.[2] It maintained its intensity for the next several days, turning back to the south on December\u00a024 and slowly recurving to the west.[1] However, the movement was erratic, and the storm executed four small loops.[2] Although the MFR had forecasting difficulties during this time, the storm remained far enough to the north of the Mascarene Islands to limit rainfall warnings.[5] On December\u00a029, Alibera began a steady track to the southwest after the ridge weakened,[2] and briefly deteriorated to minimal tropical storm status. However, it re-intensified to just shy of tropical cyclone status on January\u00a01.[1] Shortly thereafter, Alibera made landfall north of Mananjary in southeastern Madagascar,[5] at 3 a.m. local time on New Year's Day,[6] with 10\u2011minute winds of 115\u00a0km/h (71\u00a0mph). The storm quickly weakened over land, but again restrengthened upon reaching the Mozambique Channel on January\u00a03. This was short-lived, as Alibera weakened back to tropical depression status by January\u00a05. The storm moved to the southeast, turned to the southwest, and finally back to the southeast before dissipating on January\u00a07,[1] having been swept into the westerlies.[2] Alibera was the second longest-lasting tropical cyclone in the basin since the start of satellite imagery by the time it had dissipated, with a duration of 22\u00a0days. Cyclone Georgette in 1968 lasted longer at 24\u00a0days. After Alibera, the only storm to approach Alibera's duration until Cyclone Freddy, was Cyclone Leon\u2013Eline in 2000, which lasted 21\u00a0days in the basin (29\u00a0days overall).[5]"

There were 15\u00a0deaths in Mananjary alone.[2] The storm damage in Mananjary prevented ships from delivering supplies.[8] Residents in the region considered the storm to be the worst since 1925.[6] Elsewhere in southern Madagascar, the cyclone damaged about 70% of the buildings in Nosy Varika and 15% of Ivohibe. In the former town, many schools and houses were destroyed, leaving thousands homeless, and 4,230\u00a0houses were destroyed in Vohipeno. Strong winds damaged walls and roofs in several other towns in Fianarantsoa Province. The offshore island of \u00cele Sainte-Marie sustained heavy damage. Across Fianarantsoa Province, Alibera destroyed 33,065\u00a0ha (81,710 acres) of rice, corn, coffee, bananas, and vegetables, although most of the damage was to the rice crop. The cyclone also wrecked about 10,000\u00a0ha (25,000 acres) of cotton and tobacco fields in Ihosy,[8] and downed many trees along its path.[6] Areas in southeastern Madagascar experienced heavy rainfall,[9] which flooded rivers and canals in Fianarantsoa Province. Across the region, 23\u00a0roads were cut or damaged,[8] totaling 19.5\u00a0km (12.1\u00a0mi) of roads in need of repairs. This included a 500\u00a0m (1,600\u00a0ft) portion of a mountain road that was destroyed,[6] as well as a damaged section of Route nationale 7. In Vohipeno, the floods destroyed 13\u00a0bridges, and a bridge was damaged in Ifanadiana. The cyclone also cut a portion of the Fianarantsoa-C\u00f4te Est railway, thus disrupting regional economic activity. Across Madagascar, Alibera killed 46\u00a0people and left 55,346 homeless.[8] On January\u00a018, the Malagasy government issued an appeal to the international community for assistance. The Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator provided $15,000 (USD) in emergency funding to purchase immediate supplies.[8] The United States sent $20,000 to rebuild schools and hospitals. Other countries donated $135,000 in supplies or cash, including $82,000 from Japan and $23,000 from the United Kingdom.[6] In Mananjary, the local government provided 300\u00a0kg (660\u00a0lb) of rice to affected families, while the national government provided other relief goods to the city after roads were cleared. After the storm, a school in Farafangana housed 900 locals who were left homeless.[8] Existing food supplies were sufficient to feed affected residents after the storm passed.[6]"

According to contemporary reports by the newspaper Ettela'at, the city of Ardakan and outlying villages were hardest hit, with no survivors in Kakkan or Kumar. In the northwest, near the border with Turkey, the village of Shaklabad and its 100 inhabitants were buried.

Passing from Azerbaijan to Iran between February 3 and 8, the blizzard left up to 8 metres (26\u00a0ft) of snow.[1] The wind and snow resulted in the breakage of trees and power lines. The snow buried rails, roads, and many villages, and crushed vehicles beneath its weight. At the height of the storm, authorities estimated that a region including all of western Iran was beneath the snow for a week.[1] The supply of food and medicine was exhausted and the temperature plummeted to \u221225\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221213\u00a0\u00b0F), which rendered the survival of the snowstorm's victims uncertain. Furthermore, a flu epidemic had begun to hit rural areas at the start of winter, already claiming several lives.[1] The snowstorm cut off connectivity to hundreds of villages in Azerbaijan; 20 buses transporting people became trapped on both sides of Heyran mountain pass and a bus carrying 30 passengers crashed in the Heyran mountain pass, killing all of its passengers. Troops of the Soviet Army arrived too late to rescue the Soviet citizens who had been trapped. Avalanches landed on the Chalus road, and power was cut off at Anzali port. Hundreds of passengers and drivers were trapped on the roadways, and the country's main roads and Azerbaijan's train were stopped. Some individuals in Tabriz fainted from the cold. Foreign jet pilots did not dare to land at Mehrabad, and the citizens of Hamadan were trapped in their homes. Schools in 15 cities were all closed, as were numerous other events that made news.[8] On February 9, during a 24-hour lull, rescue helicopters were able to reach part of the region. Where there were villages, first-aid workers found large snowdrifts; when dug up, frozen corpses were often uncovered. In the village of Sheklab, they recovered 18 bodies before another blizzard struck on February 11. The rescue workers were forced to evacuate.[1] Army helicopters left behind two tons of provisions in the form of bread and dates, scattered on snowdrifts around villages. This was done in the hope that the inhabitants could resupply themselves if they were able to dig a tunnel out of their locations. However, few people were able to benefit from this. Out of Sheklab's 100 inhabitants, no one survived.[1]"

The low strengthened into Tropical Cyclone Kimi early the next day, as it slowly moved towards the coastline of northeastern Australia. Despite most forecasts depicting a track south into the coast, a vigorous increase in wind shear made the storm shift west away from the coastline just hours ahead of a potential landfall and caused Kimi to significantly weaken, becoming a tropical low by 18 January and dissipating entirely the next day. Preparations of the storm begun shortly after formation, with watches and warnings being issued for the land in the path of Kimi. Impacts were anticipated to be significant, with the effects of the previous storm to hit the state at the time, Cyclone Imogen, to be exacerbated from the heavy rainfall if it had made landfall. The cyclone's unexpected weakening due to a sudden and unexpected increase of wind shear early on 18 January led to tropical cyclone warnings being cancelled as Kimi became a tropical low.

Ports in Cairns, Port Douglas, Innisfail, and Cooktown were only open for emergency movements, as well as Half Moon Bay Marina. Meteorologist Shane Kennedy said that Kimi will bring significant impacts regardless if it intensifies or not. They also noted that there was a flood risk due to the impacts of Cyclone Imogen. Eleanor Rosam of the SES said crews, such as swiftwater rescue personnel, have been sent on stand-by for the potential impacts of Kimi. She urged those in the path of the incoming storm to prepare.[19] As Kimi became less of a threat to Cairns, many places and services that had previously announced cancellations and closure were reopened.[20] As Kimi moved further south, the Townsville Airport ceased operations between 18 and 19 January. The cyclone prompted an emergency alert for Palm Island, which expected a close pass.[21] Once preparations were complete, many residents of Queensland hunkered down for the storm.[22] However, forecast tracks soon depicted Kimi moving away from the coast of Australia.[23] The Bureau of Meteorology officials called the storm \"erratic\" and \"unusually unpredictable\" due to its small size.[24] As early as 18 January, large waves occurred between the towns of Yarrabah and Lucinda in the Australian state of Queensland.[25] At that time, stormy weather was also affecting portions of the state.[26] Areas still received flash flooding despite the absence of a direct hit from Kimi, most notably around Innisfail, which recorded some of the highest rainfall totals including a 158\u00a0mm (6.22\u00a0in) reading at a gauge in the town.[27]"

This storm led to flooding in the West Coast's Buller District, the Tasman District, and the Marlborough Region in the South Island, prompting the evacuations of residents and the declaration of a state of emergency.[2][3][4] Flooding also impacted the Wellington region.[5] The floods came nearly two months after flooding in Canterbury[6] and just over a month before flooding in Auckland.[7]"

        "content": "According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), large areas of New Zealand experienced above normal rainfall and above normal temperatures in July 2021, making that month the sixth-equal warmest July on record. The mean temperate for July 2021 was 8.9 Celsius, which is 1.1 Celsius warmer than the 1981\u20132010 average. According to NIWA meteorologist Chris Brandoloni, the previous month of June 2021 was the warmest recorded, and that the first seven months of the year were also the warmest since records began in 1909. Brandoloni attributed the extreme rain and heat events to climate change.[8] The extreme rain event of 15\u201318 July brought over 690\u00a0mm (27\u00a0in) of rain to parts of the West Coast Region in under 72 hours. The Buller River also experienced the country's largest flood flows since 1926 as a result of the deluge.[8] Parts of the West Coast experienced 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rain over the weekend of 17\u201318 July, roughly a month's average rainfall. The heavy rain causes rivers to break their banks and landslips, leading to the evacuation of 2,000 residents.[9] In addition to the West Coast, the South Island's Marlborough Region, Nelson, Tasman District, Canterbury high country, and North Otago experienced well above average rainfall (more than 149% of the normal rainfall).[8] Parts of the Marlborough Region recorded more than 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rain in the 48-hour period between 16 and 18 July. Onamalutu, just west of Renwick, recorded 212\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of rain on 17 July while Tunakino Valley recorded 103.5\u00a0mm (4.07\u00a0in) on 16 July. River levels within the region jumped with the Wairau River at Barnett's Bank near Tuamarina reaching almost 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) and a peak flow of 6,040 cumecs on 17 July.[10] Parts of the North Island (including the Northland Region, the inland Bay of Plenty, the Wellington Region, and the K\u0101piti Coast) also experienced above average levels of rainfall.[8] Climate expert Dr. Luke Harrington also attributed the heavy rain in the West Coast to climate change and an atmospheric river carrying moisture from the tropics. The high rainfall was also exacerbated by warmer than average sea surface temperatures, another effect of climate change. Harrington predicted that such atmospheric rivers would become more intense and frequent throughout the world as a result of climate change. The Buller and Marlborough Regions were more vulnerable to stormy weather since their geographical location meant they were trapped between incoming moisture-laden atmospheric rivers and the Southern Alps, causing the air to compress and the rain to fall.[11]"

Nine hundred people were evacuated across 500 properties in the region, including properties in Renwick, Spring Creek, and Tuamarina. Dozens of roads were closed in the region, and an order to boil drinking water was instated in the Wairau Valley.

As the low pressure trough associated with Haikui's remnants interacted with the south-westerly monsoon,[6] the Pearl River Delta started experiencing extreme rainfall beginning on the night of 7 September. By 7 pm on 7 September, Sha Tau Kok in the North District recorded more than 70 millimetres (2.8\u00a0in) rainfall. Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) issued a flood warning for Northern New Territories at 7:50 pm.[7] Heavy rainfall then spread to the entire territory, forcing the HKO to issue the Amber rainstorm signal, and later the Red signal in less than half an hour. At 11:05 pm, the highest warning level, Black rainstorm signal, was issued due to worsening situations. It was the first time the warning was issued in two years.[8] According to the HKO, between 11:00\u00a0p.m. of 7 September and 12:00 a.m, of 8 September, the HKO headquarters recorded 158.1 millimetres (6.22\u00a0in) mm of rainfall within one hour, the highest hourly rainfall rate ever in Hong Kong since records began in 1884.[9] The torrential rainfall continued overnight and into the morning of 8 September, gradually subsiding by afternoon. The Black rainstorm signal lasted over 16 hours, the longest duration ever since the rainstorm warning system was implemented in 1992. The HKO headquarters accumulated over 632 millimetres (24.9\u00a0in) of rainfall within 24 hours, a 24-hour rainfall rate trailing only the record set in May 1889. This also makes Typhoon Haikui the wettest storm in Hong Kong's history, breaking the record of Severe Tropical Storm Sam in 1999. Meanwhile, parts of Hong Kong Island, including Stanley, Chai Wan, Shau Kei Wan and North Point accumulated over 800 millimetres (31\u00a0in) of rainfall within just 12 hours, the area around Tai Tam even accumulated over 900 millimetres (35\u00a0in).[10]"

In some parts of New Territories, chest-deep water forced residents to flee villages.[13] As downpour continued, landslides rocked the territory. In the neighbourhood of Shau Kei Wan, giant boulders as large as a bus tumbled down a section of the road, some 50 meters of the road was completely covered with mud and rocks standing up to three meters high.[14][15] Luxury houses in Redhill Peninsula near Tai Tam Bay were also exposed with illegal structures following the soil slip.[16][17] Ruptures of underground water pipe created sinkholes in several part of the territory, causing minibus and car plunging into the holes.[18][19] Shek O and another nearby coastal village were isolated for a day due to a collapsed section of the Shek O Road,[20] with the Government evacuating some residents through boats."

        "content": " The 1892 Atlantic hurricane season included the last tropical cyclone on record to pass through the Cabo Verde Islands at hurricane intensity until 2015. A total of nine tropical storms developed, five of which strengthened into a hurricane, though none of them became a major hurricane.[nb 1]  However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated.[2] Three tropical storms made landfall on the United States. Neither meteorologists Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Partag\u00e1s and Henry F. Diaz in 1996 nor the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project added or removed any storms during their reanalysis of the season, though the latter upgraded the eighth storm to a hurricane. A reanalysis study by climate researcher Michael Chenoweth, published in 2014, concluded that 11\u00a0cyclones formed in the Atlantic in 1892. Chenoweth proposed the removal of the ninth system from the official hurricane database (HURDAT) and the addition to three storms. However, the changes suggested in Chenoweth's study have yet to be included in HURDAT. On June\u00a09, the first storm of the season developed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Striking Cuba and Florida, the cyclone dropped heavy precipitation in both regions. Flooding in the former rendered approximately $1.5\u00a0million (1892\u00a0USD) in damage and at least 16\u00a0deaths. Two other systems struck the United States in 1892, though neither caused much impact. In October, a hurricane passed near Tobago and moved across Venezuela, Colombia, Honduras, British Honduras, and Mexico, leaving damage in several regions and 17\u00a0fatalities, 16\u00a0of which occurred when a schooner capsized near Cabo Gracias a Dios. The ninth and final system was last noted on October\u00a029. Collectively, the storms of the 1892\u00a0season inflicted at least 33\u00a0deaths and more than $1.5\u00a0million in damage."

Initially moving northwestward, the storm made landfall later that day on the south coast of Pinar del R\u00edo Province in Cuba. The storm recurved northward and entered the Gulf of Mexico early the following morning, where it intensified and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). Around that time, it turned to the northeast and made landfall at 23:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a010 in northern Monroe County, Florida, at the same intensity. The cyclone crossed Florida and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near modern-day Deerfield Beach early the following day. Thereafter, the system headed out to sea for a few days, before re-approaching the Southeastern United States. Late on June\u00a016, it was last noted about 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) south-southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.[3] In Cuba, moderately gusty winds and torrential rainfall were reported from Santa Clara to Pinar del R\u00edo, with the worst impact conditions being experienced in Matanzas. There, the San Juan and Yumur\u00ed rivers overflowed, causing water to rise 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) above most houses. Civil guards and troops assisted rescue work and evacuation of residents.[4] Furniture in 325\u00a0houses were swept away by the floodwaters. About 450\u00a0head of cattle drowned. Additionally, 600,000\u00a0bags of sugar stored in warehouses were lost.[5] The storm left at least 16\u00a0deaths and approximately $1.5\u00a0million in damage.[4] The storm also brought winds and rains to Florida. In just a few hours, Hypoluxo recorded 3.6\u00a0in (91\u00a0mm), while Titusville measured 12.95\u00a0in (329\u00a0mm) over a period lasting six days.[6] In Jupiter, multiple trees were downed and severe damage was inflicted on crops.[4]"

A north-northwestward motion of the storm commenced by August\u00a018, while the cyclone reached hurricane status on the next day.[3] During this time, the steamship Duart Castle encountered the system; rough seas caused severe damage to the ship and shifted around its cargo, injuring six people.[4] The storm passed west of Bermuda between August\u00a019 and August\u00a020. Winds remained just below tropical storm-force winds on the island; a church, many trees, and lime and orange crops suffered extensive damage, however.[4] The system then curved northeastward, continuing in that direction until becoming extratropical near Sable Island on August\u00a021.

A railroad was also destroyed, while the city also lost communications with Caracas.[11] Approximately 800\u00a0men worked to remove dirt and other debris left by the landslide along the railroad tracks.[12] In Honduras, the storm caused significant damage to crops and banana plantations and demolished a number of residences. Several vessels capsized or went ashore,[13] including the schooner Stranger offshore Cabo Gracias a Dios, causing 16\u00a0deaths.[4] Some other ships sank at the Bay Islands, while many dwellings were destroyed on Roat\u00e1n.[13] In Mexico, several ships went missing offshore Veracruz, where the storm also demolished many buildings.[4]"

        "content": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Seroja was the third-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region, behind Cyclone Mahina in 1899 and the Flores cyclone in 1973. Seroja brought historic flooding and landslides to portions of southern Indonesia and East Timor and later went on to make landfall in Western Australia's Mid West region, becoming the first to do so since Cyclone Elaine in 1999. The twenty-second tropical low, seventh tropical cyclone, and third severe tropical cyclone of the 2020\u201321 Australian region cyclone season, the precursor of Seroja formed off the south coast of Timor island as Tropical Low 22U at 18:00 UTC on 3 April 2021; its genesis was related to convectively coupled equatorial waves.[1]\nThe tropical low moved very slowly near the island, while the system's thunderstorms increased in organization. The low intensified into Tropical Cyclone Seroja by 4 April, while it was passing north of Rote Island, while continuing its slow strengthening trend. Due to the presence of Tropical Cyclone Odette in Seroja's vicinity, interaction was anticipated as the storm moved away from Indonesia and East Timor. Its intensity fluctuated as it moved southwest, with its strengthening being highly hindered due to interaction with Odette. This caused the system to weaken as Seroja moved closer to it, due to a phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. Eventually, Seroja began to restrengthen and weaken Odette, with Seroja absorbing Odette into its circulation on 10 April. Due to Odette, Seroja was steered to the southeast towards Australia, before strengthening even further. At around 8 p.m. local time on 11 April, Seroja made landfall on the western coastline of Western Australia as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, slightly south of the coastal town of Kalbarri, bringing heavy rain and hurricane-force wind gusts (about 170\u00a0km/h, or 110\u00a0mph). Later that day, Seroja began accelerating southeastward while weakening. On 12 April, Seroja emerged off the southern coast of Western Australia while beginning to undergo an extratropical transition, before being absorbed into another larger extratropical cyclone to the south. The name Seroja means lotus in Indonesian.[2] As of May 2021, it is estimated that at least 272 people were killed by the storm,[3] with 183 people in Indonesia, 42 in East Timor,[4][5][6] and one in Australia.[7][8] At least 72 people from Indonesia and 30 from East Timor are still missing.[9][10] The cyclone damaged or destroyed more than 20,000 houses and five bridges in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province while more than 12,000 people were evacuated to government-owned shelters.[11][12][13] Around 9,000 people were displaced on East Timor, while at least 10,000 homes have been submerged.[14][15][9] Damage reports from Kalbarri, Western Australia started coming in soon after the storm made landfall. The storm is estimated to have caused over $490.7 million (2021 USD) in damages, a majority across Indonesia.[16][17][18][19] The damage caused by Cyclone Seroja in Indonesia was described as catastrophic.[20] Efforts to relieve the devastating effects of the cyclone came a short time after Seroja left Indonesia. They included almost a million USD in donations, methods to help fight COVID-19, evacuations, local governments sending aid to their respective areas, and more. East Timor also was given outside assistance from other organizations and nations. The Indonesian and Western Australian government's responses were criticized due to the slow nature of their respective responses;[21][22] in the case of Indonesia, this resulted in some high-ranking officials being fired.[23][24]"

        "content": "On 29 March, the BoM began to mention that Tropical Low 22U was developing to the south of Timor. By 3 April, the tropical low fully developed as it was within an active trough.[25] The low was located in a generally favorable environment with deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and defined outflow.[26] The low drifted close to the coast of Timor very slowly with persistent spiraling bands of convection occupying the storm's circulation, producing prolific rainfall in the surrounding regions on 3\u20134 April.[27] At this time, the low pressure system was located inside the Area of Responsibility (AoR) of TCWC Jakarta.[28] By the early morning of 4 April, the presentation of its structure had improved with spiral bands of deep convection and tight curvature at its center.[29] Although there were fluctuations in central convection, a favorable environment of deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and good outflow meant further development of the system was expected.[26][27] Meanwhile, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first warning on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 26S at 15:00 on UTC 4 April.[30] The tropical low slowly gained strength, intensifying to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, and was given the name Seroja by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) Jakarta at 20:00 UTC on 4 April, about 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Rote Island.[31][32] During 5 April, Seroja continued to move at 3\u00a0km/h (1.9\u00a0mph) in a west-southwest direction, away from the Indonesian coastline. The storm intensified to a Category 2 tropical cyclone at 19:00 UTC, with 10-minute sustained winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) and its central pressure deepening to 982\u00a0mb (29.00\u00a0inHg).[33] Long term uncertainty in both track and intensity persisted in the forecasting of Seroja's track, due to interaction with Tropical Low 23U, to the far west of the storm.[33] Seroja held this strength for roughly 12 hours, before unexpectedly weakening to a Category 1 tropical cyclone yet again on 6 April, due to southeasterly wind shear, and dry air partially exposing the low level circulation (LLC) and degrading its thunderstorm activity.[34] Seroja fluctuated in strength for several hours, intensifying slightly on 7 April, as it continued in a generally southwesterly direction.[35] Seroja became disorganized on satellite imagery as convection became dislocated to the south on 8 April, while it began to closely interact with Tropical Cyclone Odette (formerly Tropical Low 23U) just to the northwest, as a result of the Fujiwhara effect, complicating the forecasts for the tropical cyclone and causing it to weaken again.[36] Seroja resumed intensification by the next day, re-intensifying into a Category 2 tropical cyclone at 13:16 UTC on 9 April, as the storm began to absorb Odette and as wind shear started to ease off.[37] By 10 April, Seroja had absorbed most of Odette's remaining thunderstorms and began to accelerate to the southeast towards Western Australia, maintaining a relatively organized structure.[38] Later that day, Seroja fully absorbed Odette into its circulation. Seroja continued to steadily intensify as it approached the Gascoyne Region; the JTWC upgraded Seroja to a Category 1\u2013equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, with sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), at 18:00 UTC on 10 April.[39] By early on 11 April, Seroja had intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, the third severe tropical cyclone of the season, as a ragged eye began to emerge from the cyclone's central dense overcast.[40] Seroja continued rapidly accelerating to the southeast at 53\u00a0km/h (33\u00a0mph), with its eye becoming more defined on infrared and Doppler weather radar images before making landfall near Gregory, Western Australia, or just north of Geraldton at peak strength with 1-minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph), 10-minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 971 hPa (28.76 inHg), with observations of gusts as high as 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[41][42] Following landfall, Seroja quickly moved to the southeast over Australia, while gradually weakening. Early on 12 April, Seroja's extratropical remnant entered the Great Australian Bight, while beginning to transition into an extratropical cyclone, before being absorbed into a larger extratropical cyclone to the south later that day."

It was also advised that tourists be ready to change plans, in case the cyclone impacts the area and brings unsafe conditions to go home.[47][48] Due to the cyclone's uncertain track from its Fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Cyclone Odette, the chance of impacts on Western Australia was uncertain as to where it would go; out to sea or into land.[49]\nAs the storm approached Australia, the price of Australian commodities such as coals and iron ores were expected to rise. In addition, there was concern that it would disrupt or delay shipments and trades from the region.[50] The BOM also issued a tropical cyclone watch early on 9 April for much of the region between Coral Bay and Lancelin.[51] Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) Acting Commissioner Craig Waters advised all people in the watch area to 'leave immediately' as many of the homes in the area would be under significant risk with pre-saturated soil allowing flooding to likely occur much more easily.[52] BOM also mentioned that this region was not accustomed to tropical cyclone impacts, making the risk of Seroja's impacts more dangerous than usual with a month's worth of rain expected to fall within a day.[53][54] A tropical cyclone warning was then issued for Cape Cuvier to Geraldton on 10 April as Seroja neared, albeit strengthening slower than anticipated. All people between Coral Bay and Geraldton were eventually told to evacuate immediately on 11 April as homes were not built to withstand such high winds.[55] Premier Mark McGowan said that Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades\". There was a Red Alert placed along an 800 kilometer stretch of coastline south of Carnarvon and Lancelin. The people under the alert were required to stay in their houses or in an evacuation center. The latter structures were open in Port Denison, Carnarvon and Denham. The cyclone was expected to impact the area until midnight. High tides, intense rainfall, flash flooding, dangerous surf and beach erosion were among the warned dangers of Seroja.[56]"

The rains were so heavy that the capital was referred to as a \"mud pit\".[67] Damage from Seroja in East Timor was expected to exceed US$100 million, according to Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak.[17] According to a report published in January 2022 by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the flooding in East Timor affected 13 municipalities and 30,322 households, destroyed 4,212 houses, took 34 lives, and was \"...\u00a0said to be the worst the country has seen in 50 years ...\".[68] The East Timor country coordinator for the Australian Humanitarian Partnership consortium said that it was \"anything but typical\".[68] The country manager of Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad (APHEDA) attributed it to the obstruction of waterways by housing erected along them. She said that such housing blocks water canals, and that the government needed to enforce the country's pre-independence rule against building within 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) of bodies of water.[68]"

In the immediate aftermath, 41 people were killed and 28 were seriously injured.[59] Bridges and roads connecting to Flores Island and Adonara Island were destroyed.[74][75] The banks of two rivers in Ende district burst, killing two people and resulting in extensive flooding in East Flores.[59] Dozens of homes were buried under mudslides in the village of Lamenele on Adonara island.[74][75][59] In the East Flores Regency, fourteen villages were hit by flash flooding as a result of runoff of volcanic materials from Mount Ile Lewotolok.[59][76] A local chief of a village in East Flores reported that hundreds of hectares of crops were destroyed. Dozens of farm animals were also reportedly swept away by flash floods.[77] A majority of the casualties in East Flores were from the Nelelamadike village in Adonara Island after a massive rockslide struck the village.[78] The village reported 55 deaths, of whom 15 were children. More than 600 residents of the village were left homeless by the cyclone.[79] In the city of Kupang, 734 houses were damaged, affecting 2,190 people, while in Rote Ndao, around 30 houses were flooded.[80][81] A bridge connecting the cities of Kupang and Malaka Regency was destroyed, making travel between the two regions extremely difficult.[82][83] A passenger ship, the Jatra I, sunk on a port in Kupang city, after experiencing a leak. No casualties were reported from the sinking.[84][85] Another ship, the Namparnos, went adrift and grounded on Kambing Island.[85] Trans-Timor roads were flooded, cutting off access between regencies.[81] The office building of the governor of East Nusa Tenggara, commonly known as \"Sasando Building,\" was also damaged by the cyclone.[86] In East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara, approximately 11,406 people were displaced, while 66,036 homes were damaged.[87] Five cities and regencies experienced power outages, but electricity was partially restored later.[88] At least 98 base transceiver stations in East Nusa Tenggara province were damaged, although some were restored later by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology.[89] Four fuel trucks owned by Pertamina were damaged.[90] A dam in East Sumba overflowed, causing a flood in a neighboring city.[91] The cyclone affected areas as far as the city of Bima in West Nusa Tenggara, where it caused floods, submerging 10,000 homes and affecting more than 27,000 people.[59][92][93] On Lembata, the rain loosened solidified lava from an eruption in November of Ili Lewotolok volcano. The stone tumbled into several villages, killing at least 11 people.[93] A garden which had belonged to several residents of Sikumana Village in Kupang was severely flooded and turned into a two-hectare wide karst lake, after the composition of limestone and karst rock was eroded.[94][95] The karst lake was given the name \"Tuaknatun Lake\" by local residents due to the presence of teak trees nearby.[96] There were fears of a looming food crisis across East Nusa Tenggara as there were multiple reports of extensive damage on crops and stored food from harvests. Hundreds of livestock were reported as dead due to the flooding. Residents reported that more than 10,000 hectares of crops had been destroyed by the flood. In Malaka Regency, more than 4,000 hectares of crops were destroyed. This was worsened by the collapse of a spillway in the nearby Benanain Dam in the regency, which also serves as the main source of water for locals. The regency was one of the main food producer in East Nusa Tenggara. The extensive damage on crops and livestock in the regency may further worsen the crisis in the region.[97] As of 14 April, the death toll in the country had risen to 183.[4] The high death toll was most likely because most people were sleeping when the cyclone made landfall, meaning that it was unexpected.[98] In total, as much as 29 regencies and city across East Nusa Tenggara were affected by the cyclone. More than 70,000 structures across the region were damaged or destroyed and nearly half a million people were affected.[99] Farmers in the seaweed industry in Kupang Regency lost an estimated 7 billion rupiah (US$482,101) due to crop failure and destruction of cultivation facilities/infrastructure attributed to Seroja.[100] Total preliminary estimated losses in East Nusa Tenggara, according to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, amounted to at least 3.4 trillion rupiah (US$235.7 million) as of May 2021.[16]"

Rain up to 100 millimetres (3.9\u00a0in) was also reported in the town.[102][verification needed] This number of power outages soon increased to over 25,000 within hours of landfall as Seroja accelerated further inland.[103] Shortly after, unconfirmed reports claimed that buildings had already had their roofs torn off and even entire homes and sheds were completely destroyed.[104] Carnarvon's famous 124-year old \"One Mile Jetty\" collapsed and floated out to sea.[105] Some residents were required to barricade themselves within bathrooms or cupboards as their homes were damaged.[106] In the daytime, Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) reported that around 70% of structures in Kalbarri were damaged, while around 40% of those properties had been completely destroyed.[107][108] The department also received around 175 calls by the morning of 12 April.[107] Businesses based around the tourist industry in Kalbarri were afraid they might never be able to reopen.[109] News reporters reported that some houses had been completely flattened by the cyclone.[109] Heavily damaged structures which previously used asbestos as a building material in Kalbarri left the presence of asbestos fibres on the ground and airborne, which can be deadly when inhaled.[110] Widespread damage was also reported in Northampton.[111] Shire of Northampton President Craig Simkins described the damage as if a \"bomb had gone off\", with many structures having lost their roofs or being severely damaged, leaving Simkins perplexed as to whether there should be a new building code to accommodate future cyclones in the region.[112] Recovery was estimated to take several months or even years in the small town.[113] Access and communication to towns further north impacted by the cyclone, such as Geraldton, were cut off, leaving the scale of damage in the city largely unknown.[114] The cyclone was later declared as an 'insurance catastrophe', according to the Insurance Council of Australia.[115][114] During the cyclone, one person died; a 38-year-old maintenance worker who was electrocuted in Coral Bay after attempting to secure a caravan park's private power pole which had fallen down in the wind.[7][8] There were no other reports of casualties or severe injuries.[108] Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison offered federal government support for recovery in Kalbarri.[116] A fundraiser by Lord Mayor's Distress Fund in Western Australia raised AUD$2.75 million (US$2.12 million) in a little over a day to help families impacted by the cyclone.[117] Australian footballer Jamie Cripps reportedly lost his family home which was destroyed in Northampton due to Seroja.[118] DFES commissioner Darren Klemm said on 15 April that damage from Seroja could cost up to AUD$200\u00a0million (US$155\u00a0million) to repair.[18][19] A total of 875 buildings were damaged by the cyclone, while at least 32 buildings were destroyed.[119] Around 5,840 homes remained without power over a week after the cyclone, according to Western Power.[120]"

According to the Lusa News Agency, it is impossible for East Timor to currently balance the damage mitigation with the limited resources the country has.[121][64] United Nations developmental coordinator Alex Tilman said East Timor would not have the necessary resources alone to recover from the cyclone.[17] Portugal was ready to send assistance to East Timor, according to Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva.[64] The European Union and United Nations also expressed sympathy and said that they were ready to assist the East Timor government to repair damaged infrastructure and provide assistance for victims.[64] The East Timorese Minister of Interior distributed foods to victims in a hotel, which he said had been cooked by his wife.[58] TSF Radio said the assistance was symbolic and far from enough to assist the victims.[58] Local churches in Dili mobilized priests and pastors to help the victims voluntarily.[9] The Government of East Timor declared a state of emergency to speed up the mitigation process.[6] In addition, the government asked the World Bank for support in assessing damages, and advice on longer-term implications for disaster risk management. The World Bank published its report in December 2021.[122] The leader of Fretilin, Mari Alkatiri, urged East Timor government to ask for more international assistance such as helicopter and military cargo.[6] He said he already met with United Nations ambassador on Dili to discuss about more assistance.[6] The Government of East Timor reintroduced COVID-19 lockdown on three cities; Dili, Baucau, and Viqueque amid rising infection case after the disaster until 2 May.[9] Transmission of other waterborne diseases such as cholera, dengue fever, and malaria was also expected to quickly rise due to the immense floods.[17] The first COVID-19 death recorded in the country occurred shortly after the cyclone.[123][17] Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison promised additional COVID-19 vaccine doses would be diverted to East Timor.[17]"

Helicopters also dropped food and other essentials into remote villages, while sniffer dogs were deployed to search for the dozens missing from the cyclone.[145] Distribution of aid was limited by the severe weather and damaged infrastructure.[146][147] As the result, the government sent four helicopters and one cargo airplane to assist distribution.[148] The People's Representative Council urged the government to speed up the distribution of relief and suggested using Indonesian army personnel to help overcome logistical hurdles.[140][149] The Ministry of Social Affairs sent aid to flood victims in the city of Bima.[150] Kodam IX/Udayana personnel constructed eight shelter center, 20 field kitchens, and six field hospitals.[151] Hadi Tjahjanto, the Commander of Armed Forces, sent a navy ship known as KRI Oswald Siahaan (354), a Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a helicopter, and several battalions of military engineers from Kodam IX/Udayana and Kodam XIV/Hasanuddin to assist evacuation and reconstruction of infrastructures.[152] The central government of Indonesia prepared additional state funds to assist victims and the reconstruction of cities and villages in the province.[153] Indonesians organized a donation campaign for victims, especially for East Nusa Tenggara, and gathered almost 1,000,000,000 rupiahs or around $70,000 as of 6 April.[154] Ministry of Social Affairs gave compensation of around $1,000 each for deceased victims and $300 each to injured victims, in addition of other aids totaling around $760,000.[155] Each family of a victim also received 500,000 rupiahs or $35 per month for them to pay rent on family's houses or local homestay, as to minimize amount of shelter camps amid COVID-19 until their house was reconstructed by the government.[156][157] In addition, there's also compensation for each damaged houses; around $3,500 for heavily damaged, $1,500 for moderately damaged, and around $700 for lightly damaged.[158] Governor of East Java, Khofifah Indar Parawansa also send additional assistance and aid to affected region.[159] COVID-19 Task Force personnel were sent to the affected regions and shelters to limit the spread of COVID-19, using experience from 2021 South Kalimantan floods and 2021 West Sulawesi earthquake.[160] The regional police of the province inspected all of the building material stores in the region to prevent sellers putting high prices for reconstruction.[161][162] As of 6 April, more than 8,400 residents across the province had been evacuated. The majority of those who evacuated (at least 7,000 people) were residents in East Sumba Regency. The BNPB stated that at least 12 administrative regions in East Nusa Tenggara had been affected by the cyclone, of which 8 were severely affected.[163][164] Chinese President Xi Jinping offered his condolences on the disaster.[165] On Friday, president Joko Widodo paid a visit to Adonara Island and Lembata Regency.[166][167][168] Multiple local governments sent aids to affected areas. The government of West Sumatra sent 1.5 tons of rendang, a signature dish from the province, to East Nusa Tenggara. Additional funds of Rp 750 million were sent through BNPB, adding that funds will be allocated for the relief efforts in the region.[169] Funds were also received from West Java, with a total of Rp 1 billion. The West Java regional government later stated: \u201cThe Governor of West Java and his administration would like to express our deepest condolences to the people of East Nusa Tenggara.\u201d[170] The government of Central Java sent logistical aids worth at least Rp 306 million rupiah and donated Rp 457 million rupiah to East Nusa Tenggara.[171] The European Union provided \u20ac200,000 (over 3.4 billion Indonesian rupiah) to Indonesia. Vincent Piket, the EU ambassador to Indonesia, stated: \"With this assistance, the EU is expressing its solidarity with Indonesia for the many people afflicted by Cyclone Seroja. The EU stands ready to support those in need in times of crisis.\"[172] Currently, regions affected in Indonesia already moved into rehabilitation and reconstruction process as more missing victims were found and the cyclone is moving away.[173][174][175][176] After receiving orders from President Joko Widodo to relocate the survivors, Governor of East Nusa Tenggara Viktor Laiskodat urged local leaders to immediately choose the suitable locations for the relocation efforts. Reconstruction on the damaged buildings will be compensated by the government through the  Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Housing.[177] Despite calls from several prominent public figures in the province to declare Cyclone Seroja as a national disaster,[178][97] Governor of East Nusa Tenggara Viktor Laiskodat refused to do so, stating that efforts from the central government were sufficient to meet the needs of the survivors.[179]"

The fifth named storm of the 2015 Pacific hurricane season, Halola originated from a Western Pacific monsoon trough that had expanded into the Central Pacific by July\u00a05. Over the next several days, the system waxed and waned due to changes in wind shear before organizing into a tropical depression on July\u00a010 while well southwest of Hawaii. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Halola on the next day as it traveled westward. Halola crossed the International Date Line on July\u00a013 and entered the Western Pacific, where it was immediately recognized as a severe tropical storm. The storm further strengthened into a typhoon over the next day before encountering strong wind shear on July\u00a016, upon which it quickly weakened into a tropical depression as it passed south of Wake Island. However, the shear relaxed on July\u00a019, allowing Halola to reintensify. On July\u00a021, Halola regained typhoon status and later peaked with 10-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 955\u00a0hPa (mbar; 28.20\u00a0inHg). From July\u00a023 onward, increasing wind shear and dry air caused Halola to weaken slowly. The system fell below typhoon intensity on July\u00a025 as it began to recurve northwards. Halola made landfall over Kyushu on July\u00a026 as a tropical storm and dissipated in the Tsushima Strait shortly after. The typhoon initially posed a significant threat to Wake Island, prompting the evacuation of all personnel from the military base spanning the atoll; however, no damage resulted from its passage. Heavy rains and strong winds buffeted the Ryukyu Islands, with record rainfall observed in Tokunoshima. Flooding and landslides forced the evacuation of several thousand people. Damage was relatively limited, though the sugarcane crop sustained \u00a5154\u00a0million (US$1.24\u00a0million) in damage. Two people were injured in Kyushu."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Typhoon Halola's origins can be traced to a Western Pacific monsoon trough that spawned a weak low-level circulation on July\u00a03. The trough expanded eastward into the Central Pacific by July\u00a05, bringing the circulation with it. The trough would later cause the development of two more tropical cyclones in the Central Pacific: Ela and Iune. On July\u00a06, the aforementioned circulation began to increase in organization. It then began to break away from the trough and drift northward on the next day as deep convection increased. Development temporarily halted late on July\u00a07 after an upper-level anticyclone traveled northward, away from the center, causing easterly wind shear to affect the system. Late on July\u00a09, all that remained was a swirl of clouds. The shear then relaxed and allowed the exposed low-level circulation to be covered by deep convection. The system continued to organize, developing into a tropical depression on July\u00a010 at 06:00\u00a0UTC, while located approximately 1,650\u00a0km (1,030\u00a0mi) southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. Slow strengthening continued over the next couple of days, with the nascent depression being upgraded to Tropical Storm Halola by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a011. A ridge to the north of the storm steered it generally westwards, though the weakening of this ridge on July\u00a012 by an upper-level trough allowed Halola's motion to gain a northward component. The trough also inflicted slight northwesterly shear over Halola, causing Halola's 1-minute sustained winds to level off at 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph).[1] On July\u00a013 at 00:00\u00a0UTC, Halola crossed the International Date Line and entered the Western Pacific,[1] falling under the purview of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which immediately recognized it as a severe tropical storm.[2] Once in the Western Pacific, Halola began to intensify quickly, developing a small 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) wide eye and good outflow channels.[3] As a result, the JMA assessed Halola to have strengthened into a typhoon at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a014. Although the eye feature quickly disappeared, convection continued to deepen and Halola reached its initial peak intensity at 06:00\u00a0UTC with 10-minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph).[4][2] The US-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) simultaneously judged Halola to have 1-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category\u00a02 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[5] Soon after, an increase in wind shear and a decrease in outflow led to a weakening trend.[6] The system fell below typhoon status at 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a015 as it approached Wake Island.[2] Convection became sheared to the east of the low-level circulation center as Halola passed south of Wake Island on July\u00a016, reflecting the disorganized state of the system.[7] Amid the unfavorable upper-level environment, Halola weakened into a tropical depression on July\u00a017, a status it would retain for the next two days.[2] As the system tracked steadily westwards under the influence of a strong ridge, it was met with dry air that further limited thunderstorm activity through July\u00a018.[8] On July\u00a019, the environment surrounding Halola began to improve. Wind shear decreased and the storm moved west-northwestwards into an area of moister air.[9] As a result, the system began to consolidate once again, reintensifying to a tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[2] An eye feature became visible on microwave satellite imagery as Halola passed over waters with surface temperatures near 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).[10] Quick strengthening followed, with the system reaching severe tropical storm status at 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020 and typhoon status 18\u00a0hours later.[2] The eye contracted to a diameter of 9\u00a0km (5.6\u00a0mi) as the storm strengthened,[11] eventually reaching peak intensity at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a021 with 10-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 955\u00a0hPa (mbar; 28.20\u00a0inHg).[2] Over the next 12\u00a0hours, Halola weakened slightly as its eye collapsed and reformed.[12][13] Halola remained a well-organized and compact system through July\u00a022 despite worsening outflow,[14] with the JTWC assessing that it had once again attained 1-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) at 12:00\u00a0UTC.[5] On July\u00a023, Halola began to weaken gradually as wind shear increased once again and dry air began to impinge on the system.[2][15] The typhoon entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) just before 08:00\u00a0UTC and PAGASA assigned it the local name Goring;[16] the storm remained northeast of the Philippines and exited the PAR the next day.[17] Dry air completely encircled the circulation by the end of July\u00a024, causing Halola's convection to slowly dissipate. The system weakened below typhoon status on July\u00a025 as it began to curve northwards.[18][2] During this time, Halola crossed over the Ryukyu Islands, passing just northeast of Okinawa Island and landing a direct hit on the Amami Islands.[19] On July\u00a026, Halola made landfall as a tropical storm over Saikai, Nagasaki at 09:30\u00a0UTC and Sasebo, Nagasaki at 10:00\u00a0UTC.[2][20][21] Land interaction quickly took its toll on the cyclone,[22] and Halola was last noted by the JMA a couple hours later as it dissipated just north of Kyushu.[2] This ended Halola's 16-day, 7,640\u00a0km (4,750\u00a0mi) long track across the Pacific Ocean.[19]"

TCCOR\u00a03 was raised for all United States military bases in Okinawa the next morning. This was subsequently extended on July\u00a024 to cover Sasebo and Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni while the bases on Okinawa were placed under TCCOR\u00a02. Additionally, TCCOR\u00a04\u2014indicating winds of 93\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) were possible within 72\u00a0hours\u2014was raised for Camp Walker and Chinhae Naval Base in South Korea.

Sasebo Naval Base entered TCCOR\u00a01 late on July\u00a025. Following the storm's degradation into a depression on July\u00a026, all TCCOR levels were dropped or reduced.[23] More than 100\u00a0flights to and from Naha Airport were cancelled, affecting approximately 16,000\u00a0passengers, with All Nippon Airways comprising the majority of affected flights.[23] Eight flights to and from Kumejima were also canceled.[28] 23\u00a0highway bus services by 16\u00a0operators were suspended.[29] The JMA warned residents across Kyushu to be on alert for flooding.[30] Owing to the typhoon's northward turn, Okinawa was largely spared. Sustained winds at Kadena Air Base reached 48\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph), with gusts reaching 69\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph).[23] East of Okinawa in the Dait\u014d Islands, sustained winds reached 114\u00a0km/h (71\u00a0mph) on Minamidait\u014djima with a gust of 157\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph); both values were the highest in relation to the storm on land. Similar winds were recorded on Amami \u014cshima, situated between Okinawa and Kyushu. Torrential rains affected portions of the archipelago, with Isen, Tokunoshima, receiving record-breaking accumulations. Twenty-four-hour totals reached 444\u00a0mm (17.5\u00a0in), including 114.5\u00a0mm (4.51\u00a0in) in one hour and 258.5\u00a0mm (10.18\u00a0in) in three hours; all three values were record amounts since the station began observations in 1977 and considered a 1-in-50\u00a0year event.[19][31] Rainfall reached 109\u00a0mm (4.3\u00a0in) on Okinoerabujima.[32] Ironically, Halola helped suppress rainfall across the majority of mainland Japan by severing a plume of moisture previously bringing several days of heavy rain. Most areas across western Japan received modest rainfall from the dissipating storm.[19] Throughout the Dait\u014d Islands, sugarcane farms were significantly affected by Typhoon Halola, resulting in \u00a5154 million (US$1.24\u00a0million) in damage.[33] The heavy rains on Tokunoshima prompted the evacuation of 7,500\u00a0residents and flooding damaged 90\u00a0homes.[19][34] Multiple landslides were reported on the island.[34] Power outages took place on Kitadait\u014djima and Minamidait\u014d.[35] A landslide in Kunigami forced the closure of National Route 331.[36] In mainland Japan, one person was injured in Kumamoto Prefecture, Kyushu, after falling from a roof, while another person in Nagasaki hit their head after falling from a ladder.[37] In Akita Prefecture, Honshu, river levees along the Sainai River were breached by heavy rain brought on by the combination of a weather front and the remnants of Halola.[37][38] In response to the effects of Halola as well as Typhoon Nangka which struck Japan ten days earlier, the Cabinet of Japan activated additional financial support for affected areas through the Catastrophic Disasters Act.[37]"

        "content": "  Typhoon Chan-hom, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Falcon, was a large, powerful and long-lived tropical cyclone that affected most countries in the western Pacific basin. The ninth named storm of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season, Chan-hom developed on June\u00a029 from a westerly wind burst that also spawned Tropical Cyclone Raquel in the southern hemisphere. Chan-hom slowly developed while moving to the northwest, aided by warm waters but disrupted by wind shear. The storm meandered near the Northern Marianas Islands, passing over the island of Rota before beginning a steady northwest track. While near the island, the storm dropped heavy rainfall on neighboring Guam, causing flooding and minor power outages. Chan-hom intensified into a typhoon on July\u00a07, and two days later passed between the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Miyako-jima. There, strong winds left 42,000\u00a0people without power, while 27\u00a0people were injured. Around that time, the storm caused a surge in the monsoon trough, in conjunction with Tropical Storm Linfa, which caused flooding and killed 16\u00a0people in the Philippines. After passing by Okinawa, the typhoon reached peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. It passed north of Taiwan, where it brought beneficial rainfall that replenished reservoirs. On July\u00a011, Chan-hom became the strongest typhoon to make landfall in the Chinese province of Zhejiang in the month of July. About 1.1\u00a0million people were evacuated ahead of the storm, and across the country, the storm left \u00a59.84\u00a0billion (US$1.58\u00a0billion) in damage, as well as one death. Later, the storm turned to the northeast toward the Korean Peninsula. Jeju Island offshore South Korea recorded 1,250\u00a0mm (49\u00a0in) of rainfall, and one person died due to a thunderstorm in the country. On July\u00a012, the storm struck the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. The remnants later caused flooding and power outages in the Russian Far East."

        "content": "During June 2015, a near record strength pulse in the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, lead to a period of significant weather across the Western Pacific.[1][2] This significant weather included a major westerly wind burst during late June, which caused a set of twin tropical cyclones to develop.[3] The first tropical cyclone developed in the Southern Hemisphere during June 28, before it later developed into Tropical Cyclone Raquel during June 30.[3] The second tropical cyclone was first noted by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as a tropical disturbance during June 25, while it was located about 345\u00a0km (215\u00a0mi) to the south-southeast of Pohnpei State in the Federated States of Micronesia.[4][nb 1] Drifting generally northward, the disturbance slowly organized within a region of low to moderate wind shear and favorable outflow aloft. The circulation was enhanced by a surge of westerly winds to the south.[5] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a029, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] classified the system as a tropical depression.[7] Following further organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert that day at 22:30\u00a0UTC with the system located about 345\u00a0km (214\u00a0mi) northeast of Pohnpei.[8] Convection steadily deepened over the center and banding features began consolidating around the periphery.[9] On June\u00a030, the JMA upgraded the cyclone to Tropical Storm Chan-hom.[7][10][nb 3] The JTWC assessed Chan-hom to be slightly weaker at this time, initiating it as a tropical depression.[9] Situated along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge, Chan-hom moved steadily to the west.[9] Upper-level ventilation allowed for growth of the cyclone,[12] but moderate wind shear displaced the center from the deepest convection for much of July\u00a01.[13] That day, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm.[7] Early on July\u00a02, the large circulation of Chan-hom absorbed a smaller disturbance to its southeast,[14] and the storm turned to the west-southwest. Dvorak satellite classifications indicated that the system reached typhoon intensity following an expansion of the central dense overcast; the JTWC classified Chan-hom as such by 15:00\u00a0UTC,[15] although the JMA maintained it as a severe tropical storm.[7] Shortly thereafter, strong wind shear from a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell to the northeast dramatically weakened the storm. Convection was stripped away from Chan-hom's center and the storm's forward motion abruptly slowed.[16][17] Alongside the shear, subsidence over the cyclone, a trough to the north, and a remnant vortex to the northeast all served to suppress convection.[18] By 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a03, Chan-hom had weakened to a tropical storm with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph).[19] Coinciding with Chan-hom's abrupt collapse on July\u00a03, the system turned northeast as it entered a weakness in the steering ridge.[16][18] Later that day, the broad circulation turned north-northwest.[20] Wind shear eased early on July\u00a04 as the TUTT cell retreated to the north and the subtropical ridge steadily re-established itself. Convection started redeveloping over the tropical storm.[21] Late on July\u00a04 into July\u00a05, the center of Chan-hom skirted the southern coast of Rota in the Mariana Islands.[22][23] While near the island, Chan-hom executed an unusual counter-clockwise loop owing to interaction with a monsoon trough.[24][25] Once clear of the Mariana Islands, steady development ensued owing to low wind shear and good outflow.[26] Early on July\u00a07, Chan-hom attained typhoon intensity according to the JMA,[7] following to a burst in central convection.[27][28] Microwave satellite imagery indicated the formation of an eye as convection deepened and banding features tightened around the circulation.[29] On July\u00a07, the typhoon entered the Philippine area of Responsibility and was assigned the local name Falcon.[30] Chan-hom's eye briefly improved in structure before entering a state of flux and collapsing later that day; convection on the northern side of the storm diminished simultaneously.[31][32] The 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) wide eye soon re-established itself and slowly contracted to a diameter of 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) by July\u00a08.[33][34] A large storm, gale-force winds extended 445\u00a0km (277\u00a0mi) from Chan-hom's center on July\u00a09.[35] Late on July\u00a09 into July\u00a010, Chan-hom passed between the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Miyako-jima.[36] The typhoon reached its peak strength during this time with estimated winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 935 mbar (hPa; 27.61\u00a0inHg).[37] Featuring multiple intense feeder bands and a well-defined 27\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) eye, the JTWC assessed Chan-hom to have peaked as a Category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale with one-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[38] An eyewall replacement cycle and weakening convection along the northern side resulted in steady weakening starting on July\u00a010.[39][40] Increasing wind shear prevented the system from reorganizing as it neared East China.[41] Early on July\u00a011, the typhoon reached the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge and began turning to the north and later north-northeast.[42] Chan-hom made landfall in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, or roughly 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Shanghai, around 08:40\u00a0UTC.[43] The JMA assessed the storm to have had winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) while the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph).[42][44] Based on the JTWC estimate, Chan-hom was the strongest typhoon to pass within 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) of Shanghai in at least 35\u00a0years,[43] and it was the strongest landfall in Zhejiang in the month of July since recordkeeping began in 1949.[45] Thereafter the storm accelerated north-northeast and moved over the cool waters of the Yellow Sea, prompting further degradation of its structure.[46] Chan-hom weakened below typhoon-force around 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a011.[7] The system's low-level center completely exposed on July\u00a012 as it approached the Korean Peninsula.[47][48] Around 18:00\u00a0UTC, Chan-hom moved ashore on the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, southwest of the capital Pyongyang, with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph).[49][50] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a013 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while retaining gale-force winds,[51] and six hours later the system dissipated over north-central North Korea.[7]"

Shanghai Pudong International Airport recorded wind gusts of 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph).[50] Gusts were strongest along the coast and along offshore islands. Rainfall from the storm peaked at 531\u00a0mm (20.9\u00a0in) in Yuyao, Ninghai, and Xiangshan, all parts of Ningbo city within Zhejiang.[45] The rains caused widespread flooding in eastern China;[50] 11\u00a0rivers in Zhejiang surpassed the warning level of 1.91\u00a0m (6.3\u00a0ft). The storm produced high waves from Fujian to Jiangsu provinces,[45] reaching five storeys high in Wenling, washing fish ashore and flooding the coast.[55] Winds from Chan-hom were strong enough to knock down street signs across Zhejiang, as well as destroying an unoccupied building in Cixi City.[56] The storm's heavy rainfall caused a landslide in Ningbo and necessitated flood gates to be opened.[57] Also in the city, storm rains caused a hotel roof to collapse, killing one person and injuring two.[58] Throughout Zhejiang, Chan-hom wrecked 700\u00a0homes and damaged another 1,400. In neighboring Jiangsu, 300\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed, causing \u00a5120\u00a0million (US$19.3\u00a0million) in economic losses.[59] The storm wrecked greenhouses and irrigation systems while also damaging crops.[60] Storm impacts mostly affected agriculture and transportation in the country;[61] over 200,000\u00a0ha (490,000 acres) of crop fields were impacted.[62] In the Nanhui District of Shanghai, 20% of peaches and 40% of pears were lost after being damaged by the storm's winds.[63] In Shanghai, the winds knocked down over 3,000\u00a0trees.[53] The high agriculture damage \u2013 estimated at \u00a53.62\u00a0billion (US$583\u00a0million) \u2013 was mostly due to the typhoon's concurrence with the local harvesting of vegetables and melons.[53] Overall, Chan-hom affected 3.9\u00a0million people in eastern China, causing about \u00a59.84\u00a0billion (US$1.58\u00a0billion) in damage.[45]"

The United States Department of Defense issued a Condition of Readiness 3.[64] While looping near Rota, Chan-hom produced gusts of 60\u00a0km/h (37\u00a0mph).[50] On the other side of the Rota Channel, Andersen Air Force Base on northern Guam recorded wind gusts of 117\u00a0km/h (73\u00a0mph). Rainfall on the island totaled over 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in), based on radar estimates from the University of Guam,[65] and possibly as high as 410\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in).[50] On Guam, the storm caused minor power outages and flooding.[64] Although Chan-hom did not directly affect the Philippines, both Chan-hom and Tropical Storm Linfa enhanced the monsoon for several days, which caused severe flooding throughout the country.[66] Heavy rains impacted portions of Luzon and the Western Visayas, with various events resulting in five deaths. Four people also went missing when their boat sank amid strong winds off the coast of Pangasinan. A brief tornado caused minor damage in Iba, Zambales. Nearly 34,000\u00a0people were affected by the monsoon event, which killed 16\u00a0people and caused \u20b13.9\u00a0million (US$86,000) in agricultural losses.[67] On July\u00a09, the outer rainbands of Chan-hom began affecting the Japanese island of Okinawa.[50] Between July\u00a09 and 10, 326\u00a0flights were canceled at Naha Airport, affecting more than 32,000\u00a0people. A total of 176\u00a0people sought refuge in public shelters. American military bases on the island were placed under Condition of Readiness 1, the highest level.[64] Early on July\u00a010, a station near the southern end of Okinawa recorded peak wind gusts of 179.6\u00a0km/h (111.6\u00a0mph), along with sustained winds of 118.8\u00a0km/h (73.8\u00a0mph). Strong winds affected other Japanese islands in the region, and Miyako-jima recorded peak gusts of 118.8\u00a0km/h (73.8\u00a0mph).[50] The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 230\u00a0mm (9.1\u00a0in) in Nago, Okinawa.[68] At the height of the storm, 42,000\u00a0people lost power across Okinawa Prefecture.[64] The storm injured 27\u00a0people in Okinawa,[50] three seriously.[64] Two buildings were damaged. Agricultural damage across Okinawa reached \u00a5524\u00a0million (US$4.27\u00a0million), most of which was sustained by the mango crop.[69] Passing north of Taiwan, the threat of Chan-hom caused the Taiwan Stock Exchange and other public buildings to close, as well as canceling several flights.[70] The storm brought ultimately heavy rainfall, reaching 388.5\u00a0mm (15.30\u00a0in) in Taipei.[50] The Shihmen Dam, which had dropped to 55% capacity before the storm, rose to 90.26% of its capacity due to the storm's rains.[71] In South Korea, 574\u00a0flights were canceled and 163\u00a0boats were forced to remain at port.[72] The large circulation of the storm dropped heavy rainfall throughout the Korean Peninsula, beneficial in easing drought conditions. Notably, Mount Halla on the offshore Jeju Island recorded 1,250\u00a0mm (49\u00a0in) of rainfall during Chan-hon's passage.[73] Wind gusts reached 76\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) in Muan County in southwestern South Korea.[50] Thunderstorms killed one person in the country.[72] Losses in South Jeolla Province were confirmed to be \u20a94.8\u00a0billion (US$4.22\u00a0million).[74] When Chan-hom made landfall along North Korea, winds were generally less than 40\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph),[50] with gusts reaching up to 54\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph). The storm dropped heavy rainfall, reaching over 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) in North Hamgyong Province along the east coast. Flooding was limited, as most of the country received about 102\u00a0mm (4.0\u00a0in) of rainfall from the storm.[49] The remnants of Chan-hom later impacted southern areas of Khabarovsk Krai, producing heavy rain and high winds, peaking at 79\u00a0km/h (49\u00a0mph).[75] The winds downed numerous trees, some of which fell on cars,[76] and uprooted tombs in a graveyard in Khabarovsk.[77] The towns of Bikin, Sovetskaya Gavan, and Vyazma, saw 40 to 80\u00a0mm (1.6 to 3.1\u00a0in) of rain or roughly 60\u201370\u00a0percent of their average monthly precipitation for July during the storm's passage.[75][76] Flooding affected dozens of homes in the region as rivers rose by 1 to 2\u00a0m (3.3 to 6.6\u00a0ft).[75] Power and telephone service was lost in 34\u00a0communities.[78] Ferry service between Vanino and Kholmsk was suspended, temporarily stranding 1,300\u00a0passengers.[76] Damages in Khabarovsk Krai reached \u20bd87\u00a0million (US$1.54\u00a0million).[79]"

The tenth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Linfa developed on July\u00a01 over in the Philippine Sea. It moved erratically westward toward the Philippines, eventually striking the island of Luzon on July\u00a04. Linfa weakened across the island, but reorganized over the South China Sea. It turned northward and strengthened to near typhoon intensity, or winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), but weakened as it curved to the northwest toward southern China. On July\u00a09, the storm made landfall along the Chinese province of Guangdong, dissipating the next day west of Hong Kong. Interacting with the monsoon, Linfa brought heavy rainfall across much of the Philippines for several days, causing flooding and landslides that resulted in traffic accidents and power outages. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198\u00a0houses and destroyed another seven, causing \u20b1214.65\u00a0million (US$4.76\u00a0million) in damage. The storm briefly threatened Taiwan, prompting warnings and restricted ferry travel. Over China, Linfa produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds that wrecked 288\u00a0homes.

At 06:00\u00a0UTC that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis over the subsequent 24\u00a0hours.[2] However, the system quickly organized, prompting the JTWC to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert later that day, indicating that a storm would likely form imminently.[3] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a01, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression developed about 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) east-northeast of the Philippine island of Samar.[4] Early the next day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 10W, based on the organization of the rainbands about the center.[5] PAGASA \u2013 the Philippines' weather agency \u2013 also began monitoring the system, giving it the local name Egay.[6] With the subtropical ridge to the northeast, the nascent system moved northwestward initially.[5] Despite persistent shear dislocating the convection,[7] the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a02, naming it Linfa.[4] The storm slowly intensified, amplified by good outflow to the south and the presence of warm water temperatures.[8] On July\u00a03, Linfa's track briefly shifted to the southwest, by which time the convective structure had evolved into a central dense overcast.[9] There was uncertainty in the storm's future as it approached the Philippines. This was due to potential interaction with Typhoon Chan-hom to the northeast, and differences in storm models whether an approaching trough would turn Linfa to the east or the west.[10] After turning back to the northwest, the convection around Linfa became even more symmetrical, although the circulation became slightly elongated.[11] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) according to the JMA.[4] As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, the bulk of the convection was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear.[12] Late on July\u00a04, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon.[13][14] Moving westward across the island, the circulation became disorganized as the core convection diminished.[15] By late on July\u00a05, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea.[4] Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, still moving around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to move over Taiwan. The circulation remained well-defined but exposed, with the deep convection displaced to the south.[16] With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted the potential for the circulation to dissipate over open waters.[17] By July\u00a07, easing wind shear allowed the convection to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected.[18] Also on July\u00a07, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility.[19] More favorable conditions allowed the storm to intensify more on July\u00a08. Around that time, the storm turned more to the northwest due to a ridge exiting China, bringing the storm southwest of western Taiwan.[20] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a08, the JMA estimated peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph), making it a severe tropical storm.[4] The JTWC assessed further strengthening, upgrading Linfa to typhoon status at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day based on a developing well-defined eye. At that time, the agency estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[21] Early on July\u00a09, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) sent a reconnaissance aircraft into the storm, which measured winds of near hurricane-force, as well as gale-force winds 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) from the center.[22] As the storm approached the southern China coast, the eye expanded to a diameter of 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi), while the thunderstorms on the northern periphery diminished.[23] Around 03:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a09, Linfa made landfall east of Hong Kong near Lufeng, Guangdong, and it quickly weakened once over land.[24][25] The storm turned westward, inland and parallel to the southern Chinese coastline. As the thunderstorms diminished, the surface sustained winds continued to drop.[26] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a09, the JTWC issued their final advisory for Linfa,[27] and shortly after the JMA downgraded the storm to a tropical depression. The system turned to the southwest, dissipating over open waters on July\u00a010 off the coast of Guangdong province.[4]"

A lower PSWS was issued for other portions of Luzon. Ahead of the storm, 45,336\u00a0people evacuated in the Philippines, utilizing 31\u00a0government shelters and assisted by police officers. Restricted travel by boat stranded 1,147\u00a0people during the storm's passage.[28] Due to the enhancement of the southwest monsoon by the storm, all ships in the Port of Manila were ordered to remain in harbor,[29] and 20\u00a0flights were cancelled in northern Luzon.[28] La Union province declared a state of calamity on July\u00a06 because of the storm.[30] Road-clearing teams were prepared ahead of the storm.[28] The threat of the storm prompted officials in Taiwan to issue sea warnings for the island's southern coast, causing ferry service to two offshore islands to be canceled. A hot air balloon festival was canceled in Taitung City.[31] On July\u00a08, the HKO issued a Standby Signal #1 for Hong Kong due to the increased threat from Linfa. On the next day, the agency upgraded it to a Warning Signal #8, indicating that gale-force winds were expected,[24] although it was dropped in 5.5\u00a0hours, becoming one of the shortest-lasting such warning.[32] The local government opened 22\u00a0shelters, housing 196\u00a0people during the storm.[33] The storm caused the Hong Kong International Airport to close, causing 1,020\u00a0flights to be canceled.[34] The China Meteorological Administration also issued 14\u00a0warnings for the Chinese mainland, advising residents on the threat of the storm.[35] Schools were closed in Guangdong due to the storm, while train service was canceled and 10,400\u00a0boats returned to port.[36] The Chinese government handled the preparations for Linfa at the same time Typhoon Chan-hom was threatening the country's east coast.[37]"

In one of the damaged homes, an 18-month-old baby inside was thrown into a nearby field and suffered injuries.[38] While moving through the Philippines, Linfa caused flooding and four separate landslides.[28] The storm's heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise in reservoirs, prompting officials to drain some excess waters from the Binga Dam in Benguet province.[39] Schools were closed in Metro Manila for three days due to flooding and landslides.[29] The storm damaged 18\u00a0sections of roads, as well as two bridges and an irrigation canal in San Gabriel, La Union.[28] Slick roads and a fallen tree caused a bus accident in Quezon City, injuring ten people.[40] Portions of Luzon lost power during the storm,[28] including the entirety of La Union province,[41] and Bacnotan briefly lost water access.[28] In the Ilocos region, a Chinese fishing vessel docked at Currimao port ran aground after being battered by huge waves.[42] Three days of high waves washed 30\u00a0tons of mussels ashore Valladolid, Negros Occidental, prompting officials to use trucks to bury the rotting shells to prevent the spread of disease.[43] Rough waves also disrupted rescue efforts for an unrelated ferry disaster in the country that killed 54.[44] The storm interacted with the monsoon to spawn two tornadoes in Negros Occidental, as well as strong winds that knocked down trees and billboards.[45] Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198\u00a0houses and destroyed another seven. The storm damaged \u20b134\u00a0million (US$753,000) worth of crops, and total damage reached \u20b1214.65\u00a0million (US$4.76\u00a0million).[28] Most of the power outages were repaired within a few days of Linfa's passage. After the storm, officials distributed meals to affected residents.[28] Linfa was originally forecast to move northwards and make landfall in Taiwan. However, Linfa curved to the west and hit Southern China instead. Only heavy rains and gusty winds were felt in Southern and Central Taiwan.[46] Moving ashore southern China, Linfa produced wind gusts of 171\u00a0km/h (106\u00a0mph) in Huilai County, while a station in Lufeng, Guangdong recorded sustained winds of 123\u00a0km/h (76\u00a0mph). The storm also dropped heavy rainfall in southern China, peaking at 269\u00a0mm (10.6\u00a0in) in Meizhou.[35] About 370,000 lost power in Shanwei and Shantou.[47] Linfa caused 288\u00a0homes to collapse in the country, while 56,000\u00a0people were displaced.[48] One person was killed in the country. Damage totaled \u00a51.74\u00a0billion (US$280\u00a0million).[35] Linfa passed about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) north of Hong Kong as a weakening storm,[24] producing gusts of around 47\u00a0km/h (29\u00a0mph).[49] During its passage, the storm produced a storm surge of 0.48\u00a0m (1.6\u00a0ft) along Waglan Island. Rainfall reached around 40\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) in the territory.[24] The winds remained fairly weak, knocking down a few trees, both in Hong Kong and nearby Macau.[24][50]"

        "content": " The 1996 Oman cyclone (also known as Cyclone 02A) was a tenacious and deadly system that caused historic flooding in the southern Arabian Peninsula. It originated from a disturbance in the Gulf of Aden, the first such tropical cyclogenesis on record. After moving eastward, the system interacted with the monsoon trough and became a tropical storm on June\u00a011. Later that day, it turned toward Oman and struck the country's southeast coast. It weakened over land, dissipating on June\u00a012, although it continued to produce rainfall \u2013 heavy at times \u2013 over the next few days. Offshore Oman, the storm's rough waves disabled an oil tanker and damaged a fishing boat, killing one person in the latter incident. Striking Oman, the storm produced significant rainfall totals well above the monthly average, peaking at 234\u00a0mm (9.2\u00a0in) in the Dhofar region. Strong winds where the storm moved ashore damaged buildings and the local water plant. The rains washed out roads and isolated villages, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. However, the effects were more severe in Yemen, where the floods were considered the worst on record. The storm produced the heaviest rainfall in 70\u00a0years, reaching 189\u00a0mm (7.4\u00a0in) in Ma'rib. Flood waters washed away or damaged 1,068\u00a0km (664\u00a0mi) of roads and 21\u00a0bridges, some of them dating back 2,000\u00a0years to the Roman era. The storm washed away the topsoil or otherwise wrecked 42,800\u00a0ha (106,000 acres) of crop fields, accounting for US$100\u00a0million in agriculture damage. At least 1,820\u00a0houses were destroyed, many of them built on wadis, or dry river beds. Overall damage was estimated at US$1.2\u00a0billion, and there were 338\u00a0deaths in Yemen. The World Bank assisted in a project to rebuild the damaged infrastructure in Yemen and to mitigate against future floods."

        "content": "On May\u00a031, a weak circulation persisted over the warm waters of the Gulf of Aden between Yemen and Somalia. Its origins were unknown, possibly the convergence of the sea breeze along the coast of Somalia with the monsoon flow. The system produced convection, or thunderstorms, along both coasts of the body of water. As it moved east-northeastward along the coast of Yemen and Oman, the disturbance brought dry air from the north, which decreased the convection. It moved farther offshore on June\u00a07 into the open Arabian Sea, where it interacted with the south-west monsoon and developed more convection.[1] The area of thunderstorms persisted about 1,480\u00a0km (920\u00a0mi) northeast of Somalia by June\u00a09.[2] It became circular as the circulation became more defined, fueled by the instability from the monsoon trough.[1] Wind shear was expected to prevent significant development, although the system organized enough that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on June\u00a010.[2] On the next day, the agency initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 02A about 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) from the Oman coastline.[2] This marked the first occasion that a tropical cyclone originated from a system in the Gulf of Aden.[1] After becoming a tropical storm, the system's structure became more aligned as it developed an anticyclone aloft. Fueled by water temperatures of 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F), the cyclone intensified further.[1] At 03:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a011, the Omani city of Fahud recorded sustained winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph), and a station on Masirah Island recorded a pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). On this basis, the JTWC estimated that the storm attained peak winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[2] However, a nearby ship reported sustained winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph), and the well-defined structure on satellite imagery suggested winds as strong as 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[1] Moving northwestward, the cyclone made landfall around 09:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a011 about 130\u00a0km (80\u00a0mi) southwest of Masirah Island in southeastern Oman,[2] at a location named Ras Madrakah.[1] It quickly weakened over the desert terrain and dry air, and the circulation dissipated by June\u00a012 over the central portion of the country.[2] However, the remnants turned to the southwest, steered by a northerly flow. It entered the Rub' al Khali, or Empty Quarter, of Saudi Arabia late on June\u00a012, and continued slowly westward. The storm's interaction with the monsoon brought the Intertropical Convergence Zone northward into Oman and Yemen, bringing unusually heavy rainfall until the system gradually wound down.[1] The IMD \u2013 the official warning agency for the basin[nb 1] \u2013 did not track the cyclone.[4] In general, tropical cyclone forecast models failed to predict that the storm would form.[1]"

        "content": "The precursor to the storm dropped heavy rainfall in Oman, reaching 29\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) in Khaftawt on May\u00a031. The storm later produced intense precipitation across the coast and desert regions of the country.[1] Masirah recorded 48\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in) of rainfall over 36\u00a0hours, compared to their monthly average of 1\u00a0mm (0.039\u00a0in), while Salalah reported 36\u00a0mm (1.4\u00a0in), which was 600% of the average June rainfall.[5] However, the heaviest rainfall occurred on June\u00a011 and into the following day, when the system drew moisture into mountainous parts of the Dhofar region. The Jebel Ashor station recorded 234\u00a0mm (9.2\u00a0in) of rainfall over 48\u00a0hours, including 143\u00a0mm (5.6\u00a0in) on June\u00a011. Farther north, heavy rainfall occurred in the Al Hajar Mountains, where 201\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) was recorded, mostly over eight hours; there, 71.8\u00a0mm (2.83\u00a0in) of precipitation was recorded over two hours.[1] Offshore the Arabian Peninsula, the cyclone produced rough waves that disabled an oil tanker; the crew was rescued by the Omani Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days. A fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah, killing one person in the crew of nine. Near where the storm moved ashore, the storm's strong winds heavily damaged the village of Ras Madrakah. Considered the worst storm in memory, the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings, including damaging the roof of the desalination plant, leaving residents without water for several days. Strong winds of over 93\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) knocked down 20\u00a0trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings. Across the storm's track through Oman, the rains replenished water levels in aquifers, while also washing out roads and isolating villages. This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work. The Jiddat al-Harasis desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population, although many livestock were killed. Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days.[1] Damage was heaviest in Yemen, where the storm's remnants dropped the heaviest rainfall in 70\u00a0years.[1][6] Ma'rib recorded 189\u00a0mm (7.4\u00a0in) of rainfall, and the capital Sana'a reported 164\u00a0mm (6.5\u00a0in) of precipitation.[1] Widespread flooding affected much of Yemen, the worst on record for the country.[7][6] Damage was heaviest in three governorates \u2013 Hadhramaut, Shabwah, and Ma'rib \u2013 with lesser effects in three other governorates.[6] The waters washed away or damaged 1,068\u00a0km (664\u00a0mi) of roads and 21\u00a0bridges,[8] including the primary road crossing Hadhramaut.[9] Some of the damaged roads were built 2,000\u00a0years prior under the Roman Empire.[1] Primary highways were damaged in 16\u00a0locations.[10] Thousands of cars and other vehicles were inundated, necessitating boat travel to transport injured residents.[1] About 2,300\u00a0m (7,500\u00a0ft) of power lines was cut. The floods washed away 113\u00a0power poles, and four main generators were affected, causing widespread outages.[8] Storm debris contaminated also many drinking wells and damaged 1,357\u00a0water pumps damaged.[1][8] About 80% of Shabwah Governorate lost water access, forcing some residents to drink from contaminated wadis, or formerly dry river beds.[11] About one-third of gabions \u2013 structures to help with flood control \u2013 were damaged or destroyed,[12] as were 634\u00a0dykes.[6] Many Yemeni villages were isolated, and the entirety of Ahwar and Qaishan provinces were inaccessible within Abyan Governorate.[9] The floods destroyed 1,820\u00a0houses,[12] many of them washed away,[1] and many others were damaged, leaving 22,842\u00a0families homeless.[12] The storm washed away the topsoil or otherwise wrecked 42,800\u00a0ha (106,000 acres) of crop fields.[10] The storm also knocked over 37,000\u00a0fruit trees and killed 13,000\u00a0livestock,[8] accounting for about US$100\u00a0million in agriculture damage.[6] About 70% of arable land in Shabwah Governorate was washed away.[11] The floods littered about 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) of irrigation canals with sand.[8] Many of the houses and fields were built on wadis which were swept away when water levels rose.[11] The floods also damaged or destroyed 43\u00a0health facilities and 53\u00a0schools.[12] Overall, 338\u00a0people were killed by the floods in Yemen,[12] and damage was estimated at US$1.2\u00a0billion, according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters.[13][14] However, Yemen's General Secretariat for Natural Disasters and Relief estimated damage at US$200\u00a0million, which accounted for 12% of the country's GDP.[6]"

The government provided building materials to rebuild houses.[11] In the immediate aftermath, the local Red Cross chapter distributed about 1,300\u00a0blankets, 200\u00a0tents, and 200\u00a0sets of cooking tools.[15] Stagnant waters in Yemen caused a locust outbreak in August 1996 that affected Saudi Arabia for the next three months. Officials used over 350,000\u00a0L (92,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of pesticide in response to the outbreak.[1] The heavy rural damage depressed the regional economy in 1996 and 1997.[10] On June\u00a017, the government of Yemen issued an appeal for international aid, while also declaring four governorates as disaster areas.[16] After the severe flooding occurred, 20\u00a0countries and various international organizations provided money or relief goods to Yemen, amounting to US$14\u00a0million.[6] Yemen's needs were determined by a survey between officials in the Ministry of Electricity and workers in the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.[17] Several departments within the United Nations provided assistance as well toward a crop assessment, drugs, and wheat flour. The World Health Organization provided medical supplies to the country. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies provided 3\u00a0million water tablets, along with cash and general supplies. The European Commission (precursor to the European Union) donated about US$186,000 to the Yemeni Red Cross, and other European countries \u2013 France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom \u2013 also provided assistance. Other countries in the Middle East also sent supplies to Yemen. Neighboring Oman sent 28\u00a0metric tons of food, and Qatar sent US$1.2\u00a0million worth of food, blankets, and tents. Syria sent US$5\u00a0million worth of food aid.[12] As part of a plan toward preventing future floods, the World Bank provided US$14.5\u00a0million to rebuild roads, power and water plants, and regrowing lost crops.[10] In the months after the floods, the government of Yemen sought help from the International Development Association to prevent future floods from being as damaging. The government created an Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project that was geared toward more long-term solutions.[6] Thousands of farmers benefited from the improved irrigation and from the employment opportunities. Roads and bridges were rebuilt to a higher construction standard using local builders and contractors, the first such occurrence in the country using competitive bidding. The project was completed in December 2001 at a cost of US$31.59\u00a0million; the International Development Association paid US$27.44\u00a0million, and Yemen's government provided the rest of the funding.[10]"

Weak banding features also formed around the periphery of the storm.[2] By April\u00a014, deep convection persisted around the center of circulation;[3] following the development the RSMC in New Delhi, India designated the system as Depression BOB 01.[4] Following further development, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) as they anticipated the system to develop into a tropical storm.[5] Early the next morning the JTWC reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm and designated it as Cyclone 01B. The storm tracked towards the west-northwest due to a mid-level ridge over India.[6] Later that morning RSMC New Delhi reported that the depression had intensified into a deep depression and reported it was expected to intensify into Cyclonic Storm Bijli.[7] Around 1500\u00a0UTC, the RSMC New Delhi upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm and gave it the name Bijli.[8] Partial convective banding developed around the periphery of the system as it intensified.[9] The conditions for good outflow were present but did not develop. Around this time, the forward motion of the storm also slowed.[10] On April\u00a016, the storm turned towards the northeast, paralleling the eastern coast of India.[11] Around 0600\u00a0UTC, RSMC New Delhi reported that Bijli had reached its peak intensity with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph 3-minute winds).[12] Early on April\u00a017, RSMC New Delhi reported that Bijli had weakened into a deep depression as it started to move the northeast.[13]"

The warning signal was placed at No. 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest level of warning.[18] Thousands of residents on Maheshkhali Island evacuated to 80 shelters.[19] As the storm neared landfall, ports in Chittagong raised their warning level to seven.[20] Following the increased warning level, an estimated 10,000 evacuated from coastal regions.[21] Weather officials estimated that the storm would produce a storm surge of 2.1 to 3\u00a0m (7 to 10\u00a0ft).[22] On April\u00a017, all flights in and out of Bangladesh were cancelled due to dangerous conditions. Shelters were also opened and were reportedly able to accommodate about one million people.[23] In Chittagong, 6,000 volunteers set up to assist in the aftermath of the storm and about 283 medical teams formed within the group.[24] An estimated 200,000 people evacuated from Chittagong and the Cox's Bazar District before the storm made landfall.[25] The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, jointly operated by NASA and JAXA, estimated that Bijli produced a maximum of 129\u00a0mm (5.1\u00a0in) of rain over coastal Bangladesh, with rainfall rates reaching nearly 50\u00a0mm/h (2\u00a0in/h).[26] High winds downed several trees; numerous homes sustained damage and several ships on offshore islands were reportedly caught in the storm. High winds and heavy rains have also knocked out power to some communities.[21] A storm surge of 2.1\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft) was recorded in the Cox's Bazar District with reports higher amounts in localized areas. At least 12 huts, 50 betel beef fields, and a large amount of salt have been damaged by the storm.[27] Later reports indicated that thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed by the storm. The first fatality caused by Bijli occurred when a tree knocked down by high winds fell on a 9-year-old boy, killing him on impact and injuring his sister.[28] In the Cox's Bazar District, a school teacher and two students were killed. One of the two children was trampled to death during the evacuation. The other child was killed when his home collapsed on top of him.[29] During the evacuation, a 48-year-old man collapsed and died after suffering a heart attack. His child, who was only a few months old, also died from medical circumstances which were aggravated during the evacuation.[39][40] In all, the storm destroyed 500 thatched houses and 1,500 betel leaf plantations and flooded about 70,000 acres (280\u00a0km2) of cropland.[41] Throughout Bangladesh, seven people were killed and 84 were injured.[42] A total of 702 homes were destroyed and more than 3,825 others were damaged as well as 3,636 acres (14.71\u00a0km2) of agricultural land.[42][43] In the Cox's Bazar District, 607 head of livestock drowned during the storm.[44] Following the impacts of Bijli, the Government of Bangladesh allocated Tk. 79,000 (US$1,147) in assistance to affected population.[45] The Department of Relief and Rehabilitation in Bangladesh provided 450 metric tonnes of rice to four districts, 200 of which was sent to Chittagong. To prevent an outbreak of post-storm diseases, the World Health Organization activated 1,105 medical teams in the country.[44]"

The entire village of Aukpyunewa evacuated after hearing about an approaching cyclone on the radio. According to local residents, \"We are taking precautions unlike earlier\" in reference to the large loss of life due to Cyclone Nargis.[49] The storm produced little or no storm surge in Myanmar as it made landfall; however, the remnants of Bijli produced heavy rains over northern areas of the country before the storm dissipated.[50]"

        "content": " Hurricane Earl was a long-lived and powerful Cape Verde hurricane that impacted the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, the East Coast of the United States, and Eastern Canada. The fifth named storm of the season, Earl originated from a tropical wave to west of the Cape Verde Islands on August\u00a025, 2010. Tracking nearly due west, the system attained tropical storm intensity within hours of genesis. After maintaining winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) for nearly two days, Earl began to strengthen as it neared the Lesser Antilles. The storm intensified into a hurricane on August\u00a029 and later a major hurricane on August\u00a030 as it brushed the Leeward Islands. A temporary weakening trend took place as Earl moved northwestward, contributed to moderate southwesterly wind shear, but intensification later resumed by September\u00a01. Once reorganized, Earl reached its peak winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h). Executing a gradual curve to the northeast, the hurricane slowly weakened over decreasing sea surface temperatures; the storm's center passed roughly 85\u00a0mi (137\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on September\u00a03. Accelerating northeastward, the system briefly weakened to a tropical storm before reattaining hurricane strength as it made landfall near Western Head, Nova Scotia. After traversing the peninsula, the hurricane became extratropical and was later absorbed by a larger low pressure area on September\u00a06, while located north of Newfoundland. In the Lesser Antilles, the storm brought strong winds, damaging houses and toppling trees, signs, and power lines, resulting in hundreds of thousands of electrical outages. Heavy rainfall led to flooding, inundating streets and leaving waist-deep water on some islands. One death occurred in Antigua and Barbuda when a person was electrocuted while attempting to restore power. The region was inflicted with at least $40.8\u00a0million (2010 USD) in damage. Along the coast of the Eastern United States, tropical storm-force winds affected portions of North Carolina and Massachusetts; however, little damage resulted, totaling about $3.8\u00a0million in the Outer Banks. Six fatalities were confirmed in the United States as a result of rip currents and rough seas; three in Florida, two in New Jersey and one in Massachusetts. In Nova Scotia, Canada, where Earl made landfall as a Category\u00a01 hurricane, one person drowned and hundreds of thousands of people lost power for days."

        "content": "Earl formed in a well-organized area of low pressure and moved into the Atlantic Ocean as a vigorous tropical wave on early August 22.[1] After moving off the west coast of Africa, a surface low started to develop near the area of thunderstorms.[2] The surface low was able to organize the area of thunderstorms, allowing deep convection to occur near it.[3] Because of the area's increasing thunderstorm organization, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated on August 24 that the system had a 90% chance of becoming a tropical depression within the next 48 hours.[4] 18 hours later, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Seven at around 1500\u00a0UTC on August\u00a025, while it was located about 430\u00a0mi (690\u00a0km) west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands.[5] Six hours later, at about 2100 UTC, the system's maximum sustained winds were estimated to be 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). Accordingly, the depression was declared to have become the fifth tropical storm of the season, and received the name Earl.[6] Earl was forecast to head westward while gradually strengthening under the influence of low wind shear and warm ocean temperatures.[7] However, dry air caught in Earl's circulation precluded additional intensification,[8] causing the storm to maintain 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) maximum sustained winds for 36 hours.[9] On August 29, the storm resumed gradual intensification, even though wind shear increased due to the outflow from nearby Hurricane Danielle.[10] The wind shear caused Earl's low level center of circulation to become exposed, limiting Earl's intensification to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) maximum sustained winds during the following 12 hours.[11] As the storm neared the Leeward Islands, convection increased around Earl and defined banding features formed.[12] Around 1230\u00a0UTC, Earl strengthened into a hurricane roughly 365\u00a0mi (587\u00a0km) east of the northern Leeward Islands.[13] Rapid intensification ensued throughout the day as a 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) wide eye became apparent in radar imagery from Guadeloupe.[14][15] Hurricane Earl's outflow steadily improved through August\u00a030 and sustained winds rose above 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), making Earl a Category\u00a02 storm.[16] Around 1200\u00a0UTC, the center of Earl passed roughly 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) east-northeast of St. Martin with sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).[17] Several hours later, the storm further intensified into a major hurricane.[18] That afternoon, Earl became a Category\u00a04 hurricane, attaining winds of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) before leveling out in intensity.[19] A northwestward track began to become apparent by this time as the system neared the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic Ocean.[20] Early on August\u00a031, an eyewall replacement cycle, a process in which a storm's eye dissipates and is replaced by a larger one, began to take place.[21] Despite increasing wind shear, the system maintained its intensity through September\u00a01,[22] when it briefly weakened to a Category\u00a03 system.[23] Gradual strengthening took place throughout the day as the eye became better defined and convection deepened around the center. Additionally, the storm began to turn northward in response to the ridge over the Atlantic and a strong trough over the Great Lakes.[24] Hurricane Earl later attained its peak intensity during the morning of September\u00a02 with winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 928\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.40\u00a0inHg).[25] During the afternoon of September\u00a02, Earl finally succumbed to the effects of increased shear and cooler water temperatures. Embedded within the mid-latitude westerlies, a gradual northeasterly turn was expected over the following day, preventing Earl from making landfall along the East Coast of the United States.[26] Around 0600\u00a0UTC the next morning, the storm made its closest approach to the United States, passing roughly 85\u00a0mi (137\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[27] Further weakening took place throughout the day as convection weakened and the eye dissipated.[28] Earl was downgraded to a tropical storm that evening; however, the central pressure remained at an unusually low 958\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.29\u00a0inHg).[29] At the same time, the storm made its closet approach to Massachusetts, passing roughly 90\u00a0mi (140\u00a0km) southeast of Nantucket.[30] Continuing northeastward, Earl neared the Canadian Maritimes, re-strengthening slightly and regaining hurricane intensity as it approached the region. The storm made landfall in Queens County near Western Head, Nova Scotia around 1400\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04, as a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h).[31] After crossing Prince Edward Island, the storm entered the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. There, the system finally transitioned into a post-tropical storm as its windfield became asymmetric and the eastern portion of the circulation became associated with a frontal system.[32] During the afternoon of September\u00a05, the remnants of Earl were absorbed by a mid-latitude low roughly 205\u00a0mi (330\u00a0km) north-northeast of St. Anthony, Newfoundland.[33]"

        "content": "As Hurricane Earl tracked along the East Coast of the United States, a new program, the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP), was launched. A former military aircraft, a WB-57 able to reach an altitude of 60,000\u00a0ft (18,000\u00a0m), carrying 15 new instruments was flown into the storm. Additionally, routine Hurricane Hunter missions were flown into Earl, a DC-8 and the first use of an unmanned research drone. Combined, these missions made Hurricane Earl the most studied tropical cyclone in history, according to Tim Miller, the lead scientist in GRIP. The outcome of the extensive research allowed for substantially improved forecasts during the latter part of Earl's existence. As compared to a similar storm, Hurricane Floyd in 1999, warnings covered roughly 1,500\u00a0mi (2,400\u00a0km) less coastline, saving residents and businesses roughly $1\u00a0billion in evacuation losses.[34] In Anegada, a geological study, focusing on beach deposits from two significant wash-out events between 1650 and 1800, was given additional research material by the storm. Deposits left behind by the major hurricane were substantially less than the time period being studied. This led researchers to determine that a tsunami was likely the cause, rather than a hurricane. This also allowed for a connection to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake to be confirmed.[35]"

Press releases were made to the public in order to give sufficient time for preparations.[47] The following day, emergency shelters were opened on Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis and the Virgin Islands. On St. Kitts and Nevis, the Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport and Vance W. Amory International Airport were shut down and scheduled to re-open the following day. All emergency services were placed on standby on Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda.[48] Prior to Earl's arrival in the Leeward Islands, the Leeward Islands Air Transport canceled 42 flights to and from the region. The V. C. Bird International Airport on Antigua was closed on August\u00a029 and set to reopen after the storm passes.[49] Although not in the direct path of Hurricane Earl, officials in the Dominican Republic prompted evacuations of coastal towns and canceled flights across the country.[50]"

That day, a hurricane watch was issued for areas of North Carolina between Surf City and the Virginia border. A tropical storm watch was also issued south of this area to Cape Fear.[51] The next day, a hurricane warning was issued for parts of the North Carolina coastline between Bogue Banks to the Virginia border and the hurricane watch was extended northward to Cape Henlopen, Delaware.[52] Further watches and warnings were issued throughout the day, covering an increasingly large region of the coastline.[53] By September\u00a02, these advisories encompassed much of the East Coast from Bogue Banks, North Carolina to the United States-Canada border in northern Maine.[54] According to the NHC, Earl was the first major hurricane to threaten New England since Hurricane Bob in 1991.[55] Cape Cod, Massachusetts was placed under a hurricane warning by this time and this remained in place until Earl was downgraded to a tropical storm the following day.[56][57] The advisories gradually lessened in coverage as the storm moved away from the United States. The last warning in northern Maine remained in effect until the morning of September\u00a04 when Earl approached landfall in Nova Scotia.[58] On August 30, emergency officials in Massachusetts began early-stage emergency plans, ensuring that all communities had shelters, generators, sand bags and other disaster prevention materials.[59] Officials in New York and New Jersey also responded to the threat of Earl. Evacuation plans were readied for Long Island and New York City; emergency officers in New Jersey also discussed the possibility of evacuating residents from low-lying areas along the coastline.[60] Having experienced a fatality from a distant Hurricane Danielle earlier in August, officials in Maryland took the threat of Earl seriously. An estimated 250,000 people were expected to travel to the region for the Labor Day weekend, increasing the risk of loss of life from rip currents. Daily conference calls between state officials also began on August\u00a030. In Suffolk County and Nassau County on Long Island, emergency officials prepared for winds in excess of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) and warned that evacuations were possible.[61] The Long Island Rail Road suspended service to the Hamptons before the storm.[62] An administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Craig Fugate, cautioned that Earl's approach warranted a reminder for evacuation plans to be updated for the U.S. east coast, noting \"It wouldn't take much to have the storm come ashore somewhere on the coast. The message is for everyone to pay attention.\"[63] On August 31, mandatory evacuations began on North Carolina's Ocracoke Island. \"I don't remember the last time there was a mandatory evacuation order for the island,\" stated Commissioner Kenneth Collier of Hyde County. Mandatory evacuations were also issued for Hatteras Island on September 1, with a total of 30,000 residents and visitors affected.[64] On September 1, state of emergency declarations were issued by the governors of Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia.[65][66] Naval Station Norfolk was put under orders to be ready to depart port within 24 hours if necessary.[66] The following day, Governor Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency for Massachusetts.[67] NSTAR deployed crews from Michigan to Cape Cod. The ferry to Nantucket was stopping service Friday morning. Chatham, Massachusetts was under a voluntary evacuation order. Several school districts in Rhode Island released students from school early on September 3, as well as Bristol-Warren and Cumberland school Districts, which closed schools in anticipation of Hurricane Earl.[68]"

On September 2, the Red Cross placed over 900 volunteers on standby.[78]\nBecause anticipated landfall would take place at low neap tide and storm surge would be minimal, no mandatory evacuation orders were issued,[78] although some marinas required boats to be moved to safer mooring. Tourists in the area were warned of the likely impact of the coming storm by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Heritage.[78] Virtually all permanent residents stayed and prepared to be without electricity for a couple of days.[79] While ferries in the area were cancelled, the Confederation Bridge linking New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island was not closed. However, high-sided vehicles and motorcycles were barred from crossing for six hours at the height of the storm.[80]"

In Bolans Village, seven people had to be rescued after wading into waist-deep water. Following the passage of Earl, Philmore Mullin, Director of the National Office of Disaster Services, expressed his concern for the lack of action taken by residents prior to the hurricane's arrival. A country-wide holiday was declared for August\u00a030 by Governor General Dame Louise Lake-Tack to help cleanup efforts run more efficiently. Health officials advised residents to also boil their water to avoid water-borne diseases until further notice.[81] One person was killed in relation to the storm after being electrocuted while trying to restore power.[83] Throughout Antigua and Barbuda, losses from the hurricane amounted to EC$34\u00a0million (US$12.6\u00a0million).[84] In the wake of Earl, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies allocated roughly $50,000 (USD) in relief funds for the country. A three-month recovery operation was implemented within days of the storm's passage and focused on providing shelter and sustenance for the 1,000 families displaced by Earl.

A pier at Atlantic Beach was also damaged by rough seas.[119] Numerous homes along the coast were flooded by rising waters, reaching 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) in places. An estimated 6,600\u00a0residences were left without power due to Hurricane Earl.[120] Waves just offshore were measured between 25 and 36\u00a0ft (7.6 and 11.0\u00a0m), likely resulting in beach erosion.[121] In Manteo, a gas station lost its canopy and some homes lost roofing shingles due to high winds.[118] Damage in Dare County totaled over $500,000 (2010\u00a0USD), with 79\u00a0houses in the county sustaining minor damage and another six receiving major damage, mainly due to storm surge.[122] In neighboring Hyde County, strong winds caused about $2\u00a0million in crop damage.[123] Several homes were also damaged by fallen trees in the Fairfield and Swan Quarter areas.

Along the coast, large swells produced by the storm resulted in some beach erosion; however, no damage was reported.[127] Throughout Delaware, the threat of Hurricane Earl lessened Labor Day weekend tourism. Many hotels across the state reached occupancies of 40-60%, significantly lower than initially expected.[128] Along the coast, swells up to 6.02\u00a0ft (1.83\u00a0m) resulted in minor tidal flooding, though no damage took place.[129] Off the coast of New Jersey two people were killed after being swept out to sea by rip currents.[130] The bodies of both victims were found after they washed onshore days after Earl's passage.[131] The outer bands of Earl brought gusty winds and minimal rainfall, peaking at 0.22\u00a0in (5.6\u00a0mm) in Chatsworth.[132] Some beach erosion was reported along the coastline, with the worst being in Atlantic City.[133] At the city's Garden Pier, the Historical Museum and the Atlantic City Arts Center was shut down indefinitely after electrical lines and pipes were damaged by waves.[134] After nearly two weeks of beaches being shut down, swimmers were finally allowed to enter the water on September\u00a05 throughout New Jersey.[135] In Long Island, New York, heavy surf produced by Earl inundated much of Jones Beach State Park, leading to officials closing the area for several days. By September\u00a06, flood waters brought onshore by the storm still remained in the area despite continuous efforts to drain the water.[136] Moderate beach erosion also took place in Robert Moses State Park.[137] Similar impacts were felt in The Hamptons as many roads were temporarily shut down due to flooding.[138] Rainfall from the storm peaked at 2.11\u00a0in (54\u00a0mm) just outside Jamesport.[132] Following the lack of damage caused by the storm, the Long Island Power Authority was criticized for excessive spending on emergency crews. An estimated $30\u00a0million was spent to bring in an additional 1,600 crewmen to deal with possible power outages despite forecasts showing Earl missing the state. Due to the excess funding, residents in New York were faced with increased rates for power. Additionally, New York senator Charles Fuschillo called for an audit of the power authority.[139] It was later determined that LIPA had \"jumped the gun\" on the situation and brought in the assistance without necessity.[140] In their defense, the agency claimed that \"it [was] better to be safe than sorry\", referring to the power outage following Hurricane Gloria in 1985 which affected parts of Long Island for over a week.[141]"

Several hotels estimated that 10% of the revenue was lost, this equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars.[146] One hotel in Yarmouth reported an 80% decrease in attendance despite a price cut from $130 to $85.[147] On the other hand, supply stores saw improved sales, experiencing a 20% increase in revenues.[146] Due to the lack of major damage from the storm, most businesses reopened on September\u00a04 and tourists resumed their weekend plans.[148] Throughout the state, Earl left $20,000 in damage.[149] In parts of Rhode Island, coastal flooding inundated low-lying roads, leaving ocean debris behind.[150] Further north in Maine, the effects of Earl were limited to increased swells along the coast and moderate rainfall.[151] Several areas across the state measured over 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) of rain,[152] with the highest total being measured at 4.28\u00a0in (109\u00a0mm) in Machias.[145] Winds in the state peaked between 35 and 40\u00a0mph (56 and 64\u00a0km/h), though no wind damage took place.[153] Prior to Earl's arrival, a dry spell left several brooks and streams nearly empty; however, the rainfall from the storm alleviated the drought conditions. Only one road experienced flooding as a result of the rains.[152] According to state transportation officials, northbound and southbound traffic along the Maine Turnpike was down 19% and 2.7% respectively, indicating that many tourists who were expected to travel to the region changed their plans.[154]"

Onshore, strong winds and heavy rain affected much of Atlantic Canada; rainfall peaked at 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) in Edmundston, New Brunswick.[156] In Quebec, heavy rains from the storm amounted to at least 1.9 inches (48\u00a0mm); however, reports from a storm chaser indicate that up to 3.2 inches (81\u00a0mm) may have fallen in Passes-Dangereuses.[157] The strongest winds onshore reached 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) on Beaver Island.[156] Sustained winds of at least 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) likely affected all of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, much of Newfoundland, and parts of eastern New Brunswick, as well as extreme eastern Quebec and Labrador.[158] Throughout the affected region, about 252,000 residences, nearly one\u00a0million people, were left without power as a result of Earl.[159][160] Roughly 104,000 residences that lost power were in the Halifax metro area. The city received some of the worst impacts from the storm, experiencing near-hurricane-force winds around 12:00\u00a0pm (local time) on September\u00a04. Several structures in the city were struck by fallen trees. At the height of the storm, Nova Scotia Routes 207, 331 and 333 were shut down due to flooding and downed power lines.[161][162] Numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout Nova Scotia, blocking roads and damaging homes.[163] Earl's only fatality in Canada occurred when one man drowned while trying to retrieve a boat which had been dislodged from its moorings.[164] Throughout Prince Edward Island, high winds left roughly 9,000 homes and businesses without power. Minor streets flooding and downed trees impeded travel throughout the area.[163] In New Brunswick, little damage took place during Earl's passage; some trees were downed, resulting in scattered power outages.[163] Along the St. George's Bay area in Newfoundland, numerous residents were left without power due to fallen trees and power lines. No injuries or major damage took place on the island and power was expected to be fully restored by the afternoon of September\u00a05.[165] Intense winds produced by the storm felled numerous trees, some more than 100\u00a0years old, and damaged homes.[166] Within hours of the storm's passage in Nova Scotia, hundreds of power crews were deployed to restore electricity as quickly as possible. Once winds dropped below 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), roughly 400 crewmen began fixing damaged lines.[162] One lineman was injured after briefly coming into contact with live wires. Additional crews from New Brunswick, consisting of 18 trucks and 36 linemen, were deployed to the hardest hit regions.[163] Roughly 90,000 Nova Scotia residences had their electricity restored by 10:00\u00a0pm the same night. By the morning of September\u00a05, about 92,000 residences remained without power across Nova Scotia.[167] It was not until September\u00a07 that all residents affected by the storm had their power restored.[168]"

At 18:00\u00a0UTC, after deep convection had become displaced to the east of the low level circulation center, RSMC Nadi reported that the cyclone had weakened into a tropical depression.[19] During the next day, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the system after the low level circulation center had become fully exposed before the remnant tropical depression crossed the northern part of New Caledonia's Grande Terre island.[9][20][21] After crossing New Caledonia's biggest island, Freda started to move towards the southeast between Grande Terre and the Loyalty Islands, while the JTWC reported that Freda had become a subtropical cyclone, as it was positioned under a strong subtropical westerly flow.[16][22] The remnant tropical depression was subsequently last noted on 4 January, as it dissipated about 630\u00a0km (390\u00a0mi) to the southwest of Nadi, Fiji.[16][23]"

Insurance payouts totaled to $3.2 million. Meanwhile, damage to roads totaled to $2 million and over $1.5 million was down to property.[19] A total of 3 deaths were reported.[19] One man was electrocuted during the storm when he grabbed a fallen powerline when he was climbing up a bank.[20] In addition, An elderly couple died when their car slid sideways into another car on a road.[19] High waves from Cyclone Drena crashed against sea walls along the northern coast of New Zealand.[18] Roughly 140 people were evacuated at Moanatairi while residents from 20 homes were evacuated at Moanatairi, Te Puru, and Waiomu. A total of 44 homes were flooded and subsequently damaged; 33 of which had soaked carpets and ruined walls and furniture. Considerable damage was recorded on North Island, trees and powerlines were downed and house roofs were lifted. Severe damage was reported in a Northland camp ground. One road was closed for 30 hours. In Auckland, widespread damage and flooding was reported. Offshore, ferries were cancelled. In Maramarua, around 30 customers were without power for several hours. Several trams were flooded in Waikawau. Several rives were flooded in the Southland. Throughout the island, widespread rains and flooding was reported. In addition. Hauraki Gulf measured winds of up to 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph). In Thames, 3.6\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) swells were measured. Christchurch received 47\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in) of rain.[19]"

A fairly weak tropical cyclone, it caused some notable damage in Bangladesh and India. An area of low pressure formed within the Bay of Bengal on October 24. It was designated as Depression BOB 05 the next day by the India Meteorological Department. The depression was declared a deep depression early on October 26, whilst the Joint Typhoon Warning Center designated the depression as Cyclone 04B later that day with wind speeds equivalent to a tropical storm. Later that day, the IMD upgraded the deep depression into a cyclonic storm and named it as Rashmi. Rashmi then reached both its peak one- and three-minute sustained wind speeds, as it made landfall on the Bangladesh coast late on October 26. Early the next day the JTWC issued its final advisory on Rashmi as the IMD downgraded Rashmi to a deep depression. Later that day the IMD, having noted that Rashmi had weakened rapidly, downgraded the deep depression to a well marked area of low pressure and released their final advisory. The name Rashmi was submitted by Sri Lanka, to the World Meteorological Organisation's Tropical Cyclone Committee.[1] Rashmi (pronounced Rush-mee) is a Sinhalese word, which means \"ray of light\"."

The system originated from a monsoon trough that coalesced into a tropical low over the Timor Sea on 12\u00a0December. The system initially moved southwest, before moving on a more westerly course. Steady intensification occurred and Ilona reached its peak strength on 17\u00a0December as a low-end severe tropical cyclone. A southward turn directed the cyclone toward Western Australia, and it made landfall near Mardie Station. The system subsequently degraded over land and dissipated on 19\u00a0December. The cyclone's effects were relatively limited, though locally significant damage was reported in areas such as Dampier and Karratha. Several homes lost their roof and downed power lines left towns without power for several days. No casualties were reported, damage amounted to A$1\u00a0million (US$725,000), and the name Ilona was retired after the season."

On 12\u00a0December, a tropical low consolidated from the monsoon trough over the Timor Sea, west of Darwin, Northern Territory.[1][2] Moving southwest, the system skirted the Kimberley coast before turning west. Acquiring gale-force winds by 00:00\u00a0UTC on 13\u00a0December, the low was classified as a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Ilona by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Perth, Western Australia. At this time it was situated near Adele Island.[2] Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories, dubbing it Tropical Cyclone 03S.[3] Decelerating somewhat, Ilona steadily intensified over the following days and achieved severe tropical cyclone status\u2014having ten-minute sustained winds of at least 118\u00a0km/h (73\u00a0mph)\u2014around 12:00\u00a0UTC on 15\u00a0December.[2] Similarly, the JTWC assessed the system to have reached the equivalent of a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS) by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[4] Ilona turned south, and later south-southeast, on 15\u00a0December and began a steady approach to Western Australia. Slight intensification took place, with the cyclone achieving its peak strength around 00:00\u00a0UTC on 17\u00a0December with ten-minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 960 hPa (mbar; 28.35\u00a0inHg).[2] The JTWC estimated Ilona to be slightly stronger, with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph)\u2014a Category\u00a02-equivalent on the SSHS.[4] That day, Ilona passed near the North Rankin gas platform. Around 16:00\u00a0UTC, the eye of Ilona made landfall near Mardie Station. Around 16:30\u00a0UTC, the center of Ilona passed over the town, with a five-minute period of calm observed. An eye passage was also reported in Fortescue Roadhouse. The cyclone rapidly decayed as it accelerated inland, falling below tropical cyclone strength by 00:00\u00a0UTC on 19\u00a0December, at which time it was situated northeast of Meekatharra. Thereafter, the decaying low turned east and ultimately dissipated later that day just west of the Western Australia\u2013South Australia border.[2]"

The warning was quickly reinstated when forecasts showed Ilona moving south. Officials indicated that residents had roughly 12\u00a0hours to fully prepare.[5] Striking Pilbara as a severe tropical cyclone, Ilona caused significant damage in the region; however, the sparsely populated nature of the region limited the extent of severe damage. Mardie Station was buffeted by hurricane-force winds with gusts up to 174\u00a0km/h (108\u00a0mph).[2] An unconfirmed report indicated gusts as high as 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[6] These winds uprooted trees, downed power lines, and tore roofs from homes in multiple locales;[2] extensive damage occurred in Roebourne, Wickham, Dampier, Karratha, Pannawonica, and Tom Price.[6] Homes and caravans sustained damage in Karratha, reportedly the hardest-hit area according to State Emergency Services. Affected areas were without power for several days, and crews from Port Hedland were called in to assist.[6] Heavy rains also accompanied the system, with accumulations exceeding 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) across much of Pilbara, breaking December records at the time;[2][7] two-day accumulations exceeded 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) in some locations.[8] The rainfall was mostly beneficial to the region.[7] Offshore, the combined effects of Cyclones Ilona and Orson in March\u00a01989 caused tremendous damage to coral reefs\u2014mainly populated by Acropora\u2014in eastern areas of Mermaid Sound. Turbulent waters killed or broke apart 50\u2013100% of the living coral across all sites in the sound.[9] In coastal Dampier, 12\u00a0boats sank, capsized, or were washed ashore.[2] Damage amounted to A$1\u00a0million (US$725,000).[10] Though no casualties were reported,[6] the effects of Ilona were deemed severe enough for its name to be retired after the season.[11]"

Railway systems were damaged, and landslides blocked roads and carried away telegraph lines.[6] Broadly speaking, floodwaters moved from the northern and central regions toward the Danube lowlands in the south and east.[6] The Prahova,[6] T\u00e2rnava, Olt (threatening R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea and Slatina)[3] and Tisza[7] rivers were among those affected, as well as the Danube (which rose up to 6\u00bd ft above normal spring high-water levels, flooding docks and port installations in Turnu Severin),[8] Prut and Siret.[6] As crests rolled onward, downstream localities knew to fear the worst: for instance, Gala\u021bi and Br\u0103ila knew by June 3 that floods from three weeks earlier would reach them on June 11, the question being if their dikes would hold. The neighbouring Soviet Union and Bulgaria were not nearly as threatened, as the Prut and Danube banks are steep and high on their shores.[1] The floods also came in phases: for instance, the waters were just beginning to recede when on May 23\u201324 renewed heavy rain and snowfalls raised their level again.[9] Significant resources were mobilised to fight the waters and their effects. Medical teams toured most areas of the country warning people not to drink polluted water (many drinking water installations were destroyed) and inoculating all citizens aged 2 to 55 against typhoid fever.[3][6] Thousands of soldiers and civilians worked around the clock to build miles of new dikes and reinforce old ones.[1]"

General Secretary Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu took personal direction of some emergency measures in the Br\u0103ila and Gala\u021bi areas, particularly sensitive because their heavy industry and grain shipping centres are near the Danube, Prut and Siret, all three of which were swollen and which merge four miles (6\u00a0km) upstream from Gala\u021bi. On May 22, wearing a black turtleneck sweater, workman's cloth cap and farmer's jacket, Ceau\u0219escu and high Romanian Communist Party leaders spent hours superintending the completion of a five-mile (8\u00a0km)-long earth and timber dike at Br\u0103ila.[6] In foreign policy, the floods offered him an opportunity to continue Romania's independent foreign policy, which sought to keep its distance from the Soviet Union. While at the height of the floods, he made a sudden trip to Moscow, followed a week later by Prime Minister Ion Gheorghe Maurer, this worried Romanians and Ceau\u0219escu then toured the country, saying over and over in speeches to flood victims that his policy remained unchanged\u2014national independence and sovereignty, noninterference in the internal affairs of other states, equality between governments and between Communist parties, and the right of each party to shape its own policies.[10] The provision of foreign aid also reflected this independent course. The single largest relief payment, the equivalent of $400,000, came from the People's Republic of China, then embroiled in the Sino-Soviet split. The first relief plane came from Israel; Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country to have relations with Israel at the time. Aid from the United States and the Netherlands soon followed, but a week passed before the USSR sent a message and an offer of aid. Moreover, Western companies offered to repair or replace damaged industrial equipment they had furnished:[10] the Gala\u021bi iron and steel plant (Romania's largest) was built with Western expertise and equipment against Soviet opposition.[1] Over a dozen countries, including France and Yugoslavia, gave aid.[6] British aid organisations promised 50 tons of food, children's clothing and medicine, while West Germany sent a number of mobile water-purification units. A special fund was set up in Bucharest to assist flood victims; money poured in from factory groups throughout Romania. In one Bucharest institute, 100 donors a day gave blood, while scores of foreign diplomats gave clothing and household items.[3]"

During the rains, a woman gives birth to her child while her father is dying in an adjacent room. As the waters close in on her, her sole thought is to raise the baby above her head in an effort to save it.[11] The main goal of building the St\u00e2nca-Coste\u0219ti Dam, completed in 1978, was to protect villages down the Prut river from floods.[12][13]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Ewiniar was a tropical cyclone in early June 2018 that brought prolonged heavy rains to Vietnam and South China, causing damaging floods and landslides. The fourth named storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season, Ewiniar developed as a tropical depression just east of Vietnam on June\u00a02. The system moved generally northwards over the South China Sea, before intensifying into a tropical storm near the Qiongzhou Strait on June\u00a05. Ewiniar proceeded to stall over the region as steering currents collapsed, making landfall over the Leizhou Peninsula and later over northern Hainan. Ewiniar accelerated to the northeast on June\u00a07 and moved back over open sea, allowing it to strengthen slightly and reach peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 998\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.57\u00a0inHg). The storm made landfall in eastern Guangdong shortly thereafter and weakened into a tropical depression on June\u00a08. The system ultimately dissipated east of Taiwan on June\u00a011. In combination with the southwest monsoon, Ewiniar dumped heavy rain over Vietnam and South China for over a week. In Vietnam, a few houses were damaged and one person was killed. Roads in Ho Chi Minh City were inundated. In Hainan and Guangdong, over a hundred flights were cancelled and ships were forced to return to port to take shelter. Daily rainfall records for June were set in eight cities. Twenty-nine houses were destroyed and over 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) of crops were damaged. Landslides killed five people in Yunfu and left one missing in Jiangmen. Strong winds blew down a construction site in Guangzhou, killing one and injuring eight, and caused a building collapse in Shenzhen that killed four and injured four others. Another two people were electrocuted by faulty wiring. A tornado occurred in Foshan, damaging a market and three vehicles. Travel disruptions also posed difficulties for students taking the National College Entrance Examination. A total of 13 people were killed in South China and direct economic losses were valued at \u00a55.19\u00a0billion (US$784\u00a0million).[nb 1] In Hong Kong and Macao, strong wind signals were issued and some schools were closed. Gusty winds felled trees and heavy rains caused flash flooding, while a waterspout was sighted near Cheung Chau."

        "content": "Ewiniar originated from an area of scattered thunderstorms that developed just southeast of Puerto Princesa on May\u00a031.[2] The system moved northwest and consolidated, with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) determining that it consolidated into a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a02.[3] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit six hours later, by which time the system was about 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) off the coast of Vietnam.[4][nb 2] The depression, pushed northwest by a subtropical ridge to its northeast, organized only slowly amid an environment marginally conducive to intensification, with wind shear limiting convection mostly to the depression's western flank.[6] The depression changed little in strength on June\u00a03 and 4 as it turned further north around the western edge of the aforementioned ridge,[7] eventually curving to the north-northeast on June\u00a05. Around this time, thunderstorm activity increased in coverage with the development of outflow channels;[8] as a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ewiniar at 00:00\u00a0UTC.[4] Wind shear decreased later on June\u00a05, allowing Ewiniar to maintain thunderstorms near its center and intensify slightly.[9] The JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC as the storm's motion slowed and turned back to the northwest.[3] The subtropical ridge steering the storm collapsed thereafter, leaving Ewiniar in a zone of weak steering currents over the Qiongzhou Strait.[10] The system made landfall in Xuwen, Guangdong, at 22:25\u00a0UTC on June\u00a05, before turning southwest and making another landfall in Haikou, Hainan, at 06:50\u00a0UTC on June\u00a06.[11] While over the Leizhou Peninsula, the JTWC assessed that Ewiniar weakened back into a tropical depression,[3] whereas the JMA maintained the system at tropical storm intensity.[4] On June\u00a07, Ewiniar finally began to accelerate east-northeastwards ahead of a shortwave trough. This moved Ewiniar back over water and allowed it to restrengthen,[12] reaching peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 998\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.57\u00a0inHg) at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[4][3] Ewiniar then turned to the north-northeast as it began to interact with the Meiyu front,[13] before making a third landfall in Yangjiang, Guangdong, at 12:30\u00a0UTC June\u00a07.[11] Once inland, the system soon became embedded within the Meiyu front and the JTWC declared that Ewiniar dissipated as a tropical cyclone near midday on June\u00a08.[14][3] The JMA, however, continued to track Ewiniar as a tropical depression while the system turned back east and emerged over the South China Sea on June\u00a010. After crossing Taiwan on June\u00a011, Ewiniar was finally declared to have dissipated by the JMA.[4]"

It originated from a tropical disturbance on December\u00a026, 2015, east of the Solomon Islands. Moving generally east, development was initially slow and the system finally reached cyclone strength\u2014having gale-force winds\u2014on December\u00a030. The newly christened Tropical Cyclone Ula turned sharply south and rapidly intensified, attaining hurricane strength the following day. A shift to the southwest brought the system close to the northern islands of Tonga on January\u00a02, 2016. It subsequently brushed several islands in the Lau Group of Fiji before weakening. Nearly degrading to a tropical depression, Ula turned to the northwest and regained strength. After turning back to the southwest, it achieved its peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 on the Australian scale with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) on January\u00a010. Thereafter, the storm bypassed Vanuatu to the southeast and New Caledonia to the east as it accelerated southward. Throughout its existence, Ula affected several nations but its effects were largely limited, with only localized areas reporting damage. Dozens of structures were damaged or destroyed in Tuvalu while crops in Tonga, Fiji, and Vanuatu were impacted. No fatalities have been attributed to the storm, though one person was swept out to sea in American Samoa and was not found. Residents across the Lau Islands of Fiji required food security due to crop losses."

Tracking east, the system struggled to develop within a highly sheared environment.[2] By December\u00a029, the system was centered roughly 230\u00a0km (145\u00a0mi) northeast of Pago Pago, American Samoa, and had developed a low-level circulation accompanied by persistent convection.[3] Development hastened throughout the day, with banding features forming and upper-level outflow becoming established over the system.[4] The system soon acquired gale-force and the FMS upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 21:00\u00a0UTC.[5] Ula moved to the south and eventually west as the system intensified. By January 2, Ula had attained hurricane strength as the storm was upgraded into a Category 2 Tropical Cyclone. Ula has subsequently attained a preliminary peak intensity at Category 3 tropical cyclone status, equivalent to Category 2 hurricane status. Ula weakened afterwards, only to re-intensify to category 3 status again the next day. By January 7, however, Ula turned northwest, slowed and dropped to tropical cyclone status. With the unfavorable conditions, Ula remained at that status for three days. On January 10, Ula rapidly re-intensified to a peak intensity of 115\u00a0mph (ten-minute sustained) or 140\u00a0mph (one-minute sustained) winds. This constituted as peak intensity and Ula was upgraded to category 4 severe tropical cyclone status, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded Ula to a category 4 cyclone. Ula kept category 4 status for 24 hours before an abrupt weakening to a tropical depression. By 12:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a012, Ula transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[6]"

So far 2.78 lakh (278\u00a0thousand) cusecs of water had been discharged by DVC as of 1 August. The situation in Bengal got worse on Thursday after Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) released more water from its dams and sounded a red alert in the lower catchment areas of the Damodar river. An additional 249,450 cusecs[5] of water was released from Durgapur barrage on Thursday morning. As a result, more areas in east Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah were hit by flood.[5] The flood affected districts had received record rainfall from 20 to 25 July. Compared to the normal rainfall received in July, Bankura received 754 per cent, Burdwan 334 per cent, Birbhum 313 per cent, East Midnapore 500 per cent, West Midnapore 424 per cent, Howrah 427 per cent, Hooghly 359 per cent, Kolkata 367 per cent, Murshidabad 174 per cent, and Purulia 721 per cent more rainfall.

However, these were not enough to compensate for the trade imbalance and the insistence by the Chinese that they be paid in silver. Opium exports from India after 1830 provided the silver needed to balance the trade. Lin Zexu, a special Chinese commissioner appointed by the Qing Daoguang Emperor, wrote a letter to Queen Victoria in 1839 taking a stance against the acceptance of opium in trade.

The First Opium War (1839\u20131842) began at the hands of Captain Charles Elliot of the Royal Navy and Captain Anthony Blaxland Stransham of the Royal Marines. After a series of Chinese defeats, Hong Kong Island was occupied by the British on 20 January 1841. Commander (later Admiral) Edward Belcher, aboard HMS Sulphur, landed in Hong Kong on 25 January 1841.[6] Possession Street still exists to mark the  event, with Belcher's Bay named after Belcher. [6] Commodore Sir Gordon Bremer raised the Union Jack and claimed Hong Kong as a colony on 26 January 1841.[6] He erected naval store sheds there in April 1841.[7] The island was first used by the British as a staging post during the war, and while the East India Company intended to establish a permanent base on the island of Zhoushan, Elliot took it upon himself to claim the island on a permanent basis. The ostensible authority for the occupation was negotiated between Captain Eliot and the Viceroy of Liangguang, the Manchu official Qishan. The Convention of Chuenpi was concluded but had not been recognised by the Qing Dynasty court at Beijing. Subsequently, Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanking, when the territory became a Crown colony.[8] The Opium War was ostensibly fought to liberalise trade with China. With a base in Hong Kong, British traders, opium dealers, and merchants including Jardine Matheson & Co. and Dent & Co. launched the city which would become the 'free trade' nexus of the East. American opium traders and merchant bankers such as the Russell, Perkins and Forbes families would soon join the trade. On signature of the 1860 Convention of Peking, which marked the end of formal ended hostilities in the Second Opium War (1856\u20131858), Britain acquired the area south of Boundary Street on the Kowloon Peninsula rent-free under a perpetual lease. Later, in 1898, the Qing government reluctantly agreed to the Convention between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory (also known as the Second Convention of Peking) that compelled China to cede a further area north of Boundary Street to the Sham Chun River along with more than two hundred nearby islands.[9] Seen by the British government as vital to safeguard the defensive capabilities of Hong Kong, these areas became collectively known as the New Territories. The 99-year lease would expire at midnight on 30\u00a0June, 1997.[8]"

Other events such as floods, typhoons and famine in mainland China would also play a role in establishing Hong Kong as a place to escape the mayhem. According to the census of 1865, Hong Kong had a population of 125,504, of which some 2,000 were Americans and Europeans.[10] In 1914 despite an exodus of 60,000 Chinese fearing an attack on the colony during World War I, Hong Kong's population continued to increase from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925 and 1.6 million by 1941.[12]"

There were, however, a small number of Chinese elites that the British governors relied on, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung.[14] They accepted their place in the Hong Kong hierarchy, and served as main communicators and mediators between the government and the Chinese population. Sir Kai Ho was an unofficial member of the Legislative Council. Robert Hotung wanted Chinese citizens to recognise Hong Kong as the new home after the fall of China's last dynasty in 1911. As a millionaire with financial influence, he emphasised that no part of the demographics was purely indigenous.[15]"

Due to the commercial success of merchants, boatmen, carters and fishermen there, Hong Kong overtook China's most populous port in Canton. By 1880 Hong Kong's port would handle 27% of the mainland's export and 37% of imports.[1]\nA British traveller, Isabella Bird, described Hong Kong in the 1870s as a colony filled with comforts and entertainment only a Victorian society would be able to enjoy. Other descriptions mentioned courts, hotels, post offices, shops, city hall complexes, museums, libraries and structures in impressive manner for the era.[1] Many European businessmen went to Hong Kong to do business.

The first railway line was also launched in 1910 as the Kowloon-Canton Railway.\nOn land the rickshaws were extremely popular when they were first imported from Japan in 1874, since it was affordable and necessary for street merchants to haul goods. Sedan chairs were the preferred mode of the transport for the wealthy Europeans who lived on Victoria Peak due to the steep grade which ruled out rickshaws until the introduction of the Peak Tram.  The first automobiles in Hong Kong had petrol-driven internal combustion engines and arrived between 1903 and 1905.  Initially they were not well received by the public. Only around 1910 did the cars begin to gain appeal. Most of the owners were British.[18] Buses operated by various independent companies flourished in the 1920s until the government formally issued franchises for the China Motor Bus and Kowloon Motor Bus companies in 1933.\nThe flying boats were the first British aeroplanes to reach Hong Kong in 1928.

Both Chinese Communist and Nationalist agitators found refuge in the territory, when they did not actively participate in the turmoil in China. However, the dockworkers strikes in the 1920s and 1930s were widely attributed to the Communists by the authorities, and caused a backlash against them. A strike in 1920 was ended with a wage increase of HKD 32 cents.[14]\nAmbrose King, in his controversial 1975 paper Administrative Absorption of Politics in Hong Kong, described the colonial Hong Kong's administration as \"elite consensual government\".[23] In it, he claimed, any coalition of elites or forces capable of challenging the legitimacy of Hong Kong's administrative structure would be co-opted by the existing apparatus through the appointment of leading political activists, business figures and other elites to oversight committees, by granting them British honours, and by bringing them into elite institutions like Hong Kong's horse racing clubs. He called this \"synarchy\", an extension of John K. Fairbank's use of the word to describe the mechanisms of government under the late Qing dynasty in China.\nWhen modern China began after the fall of the last dynasty, one of the first political statements made in Hong Kong was the immediate change from long queue hairstyles to short haircuts.[14] In 1938, Guangzhou fell to the hands of the Japanese, Hong Kong was considered a strategic military outpost for all trades in the far east.  Though Winston Churchill assured that Hong Kong was an \"impregnable fortress\",[14] it was taken as a reality check response since the British Army actually stretched too thin to battle on two fronts.[14]"

By January\u00a017, an area of convection persisted about 510 kilometres (320\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Antananarivo, Madagascar.[2] Early on January\u00a018; the circulation rapidly consolidated and organized while the thunderstorms developed into tightly curved rainbands. Environmental conditions favored further development; an anticyclone formed over the disturbance, an approaching trough provided favorable outflow, and the system benefited from both light wind shear and warm water temperatures.[3] At 0600\u00a0UTC on the 18th, the R\u00e9union M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office (MFR) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 07, noting its intensification as it drifted southwestward.[4] Six hours after being declared a tropical disturbance, MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status, and the agency predicted the system would eventually reach peak winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) before moving ashore. Its track was expected to follow that of another tropical cyclone east of Madagascar, which would become Tropical Storm Eric.[5] Late on January\u00a018, the system briefly became disorganized,[6] only to re-organize and attain tropical storm status on January\u00a019; upon doing so, the Malagasy Weather Service named it Fanele.[7] Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the storm. The agency noted uncertainty in the future track of the storm, due to interaction with Tropical Storm Eric east of Madagascar, and Fanele was located within an area of weak steering currents.[8] Tropical Storm Fanele quickly strengthened, developing an eye feature,[9] and late on January\u00a019 the JTWC estimated sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph); the agency predicted further strengthening to peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[10] Around that time, Fanele began rapid deepening under very favorable environmental conditions, and the MFR upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph). Upon attaining tropical cyclone status, the MFR forecast Fanele would intensify further to peak winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[11] Early on January\u00a020, Cyclone Fanele began a northeast motion, tracking along the eastern periphery of a ridge located over Mozambique. Later it turned southeastward under the influence of another ridge further to the east.[12] The thunderstorms organized further around the eye, and at 1200\u00a0UTC on January\u00a020 the MFR estimated Fanele attained peak winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) about 180\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Morondava along the Madagascar coast.[13] At the same time, its atmospheric pressure was estimated at 927\u00a0hPa (mbar), and peak wind gusts were estimated at 261\u00a0km/h (162\u00a0mph).[14] The JTWC also assessed peak winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[15] As it approached the coast, the cyclone became slightly less organized, with weaker convection and a less distinct eye;[13][15] the weakening was due to an eyewall replacement cycle. At around 0215\u00a0UTC on January\u00a021, Fanele made landfall on the western Madagascar coastline,[16] to the southwest of Morondava.[14] Cyclone Fanele weakened quickly over land; within four hours of moving ashore, its winds decreased to 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph), and its wind field expanded.[16] The eye feature dissipated as the system weakened to tropical storm status,[17] and increased wind shear contributed to further weakening.[18] By January\u00a022, the poorly defined circulation moved over open waters, by which time its winds weakened to about 45\u00a0km/h (28\u00a0mph).[19] Upon reaching the ocean, convection began to reform near the circulation,[20] and Fanele re-attained tropical storm status.[21] Cooler waters caused convection diminish near the center, which began the process of extratropical transition.[22] Late on January\u00a022, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the storm.[23] By January\u00a023, Fanele completed the transition into an extratropical storm as it accelerated toward the south-southeast.[24] It persisted as a distinct tropical cyclone until later that day.[14]"

Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. The World Food Programme prepared 87\u00a0metric tons (MT) of cereal and 13\u00a0MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January\u00a025 with various supplies.[30] In the days after the storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery.[25] To prevent the spread of disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits and bed nets.[28] As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents,[28] while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings.[30] Despite the quick response by the UN, thousands of people were left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.[27]"

Deposits preserved on the alluvial fan deltas here show that geologically similar catastrophes have occurred with regularity since prehistoric times.[2] Since the 17th century, at least two large-magnitude debris flow, landslide, or flood events, on average, have occurred each century within the modern boundaries of Vargas. Recorded events occurred in February 1798, August 1912, January 1914, November 1938, May 1944, November 1944, August 1948, and February 1951. In the February 1798 event, flash floods and debris flows severely damaged 219 homes. Spanish soldiers barricaded an upstream-facing entrance to a fort with cannons in order to prevent debris from filling it.[2] Prior to the 1999 disaster, the most recent major flood had occurred in 1951, but that event did not cause as much damage.[2] Based on aerial photos and records of measurements, geologists were able to directly compare the 1951 event to the 1999 event. The 1951 event involved less rainfall than the 1999 event, fewer landslides were triggered, and less fresh debris was observed on the fans.[2] The unusually strong storm in December 1999 dumped 911 millimetres (35.9\u00a0in) of rain over just a few days, triggering widespread soil instability and flow of debris.[3] Adding to the devastation, Vargas State had experienced high population growth and development since the 1951 disaster, thus increasing the toll of casualties."

As of 1999, several hundred thousand people lived in this narrow coastal strip in Vargas State.

The first, and less powerful, storm that month occurred 2\u20133 December and dropped 200 millimetres (7.9\u00a0in) of rain on the coast.[4] Two weeks later, in a 52-hour span during 14, 15 and 16 December 1999, 911 millimeters (35.9\u00a0in) of rain (approximately one year's average total rainfall for the region) was measured on the north-central coast of Venezuela at Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela. These heavy rains included 72 millimeters (2.8\u00a0in) of accumulation in just one hour, between 6 and 7 AM on the 16th; precipitation on both the 15th and 16th exceeded the 1,000-year probability rainfall event. Even so, the coast received much less rain than some regions upstream.[2] This sudden and intense storm was especially unusual because it occurred in December, while the typical rainy season in coastal Venezuela lasts from May to October. These out-of-season rains formed when a cold front interacted with a moist southwesterly flow in the Pacific Ocean. This interaction produced moderate to heavy rainfall starting in the first week of December and culminating in the 14\u201316 December event that caused the deadly floods and debris flows.[2] The heaviest rains were centered around the mid-upper part of the San Juli\u00e1n basin, which feeds water and sediment onto the Caraballeda fan. Heavy rains persisted within 8 kilometers (5.0\u00a0mi) of the coast, and subsided on the Caracas side of the Cerro El \u00c1vila. Rainfall rates also decreased westward toward Maiquet\u00eda.[2]"

        "content": "The alluvial fans that spread out into the sea from valley mouths were built by previous flood and debris flow events.[2] The modern channel systems of these alluvial fan deltas are incised into previously deposited debris flow and flood material.[2][4] Scientists at the US Geological Survey measured these old deposits. They found that they are thicker than the December 1999 ones and contain larger boulders. This means that previous debris flows were even larger than those in December 1999 and reached higher velocities.[2] On the Caraballeda fan, the extent of the 1951 event paled in comparison to the 1999 event. Much of the deposits that constitute the Caraballeda fan are of a thickness similar to those produced in the 1999 event and contain boulders of a size similar to those observed in 1999.[2] The USGS geologists found paleosols with organic material above and below a 10-meter (33\u00a0ft) thick layer of debris flow deposits. The bottom paleosol was radiocarbon dated to 4267 \u00b138 years Before Present (BP), and the top one was dated to 3720\u00b150 years BP. This means that, at least in this area, the bed aggraded 10 meters (33\u00a0ft) in 550 years, for an average rate of about 1.8\u00a0cm (0.71\u00a0in) per year (though the aggradation occurs only during short-lived events). The scientists were not able to tell whether the deposits were from a single debris flow or multiple events.[2]"

They are poorly channelized because sediment is being added to them from upstream (infilling the channels) at a rate equal to or greater than the rate at which it can be removed.[2] Hillslopes are steepened past the angle of repose for noncohesive materials. This oversteepening is more than could be provided for by the frictional resistance of the sandy soils. Internal soil cohesion, negative pore pressure (\"soil suction\"), soil structure, and/or tree root reinforcement may be responsible for this.[2]"

These abandoned high surfaces suggest recent and continuing tectonic uplift of the Venezuelan coast and corresponding river channel incision. In spite of the fact that most onshore faults active in this region during the Quaternary are mapped as right-lateral strike-slip, it is possible that there is a vertical component of offset in offshore faults.[2]"

        "content": "Heavy rains fell in December 1999 along the north-central coast of Venezuela, culminating in a period of extreme intensity from 14 to 16 December. Starting around 8 PM local time (AST) on 15 December, runoff entered channels and rushed towards the sea, picking up and depositing sediments on its way. Generally after this first wave of flooding, from the coast to just past the crest of the Sierra de Avila, these rains triggered thousands[4] of shallow landslides that stripped soil and rock off the landscape and sent them slipping down the mountainside. Additional water liquefied these landslides into debris flows, which are granular flows in which water mixes with high concentrations of rock and mud. The first eyewitness accounts of debris flows were from 8:30 PM on the 15th, and the final debris flows were reported between 8 and 9 AM on 16 December. Many catchments released multiple debris flows, some of which carried large boulders and tree trunks onto the alluvial fan deltas. Starting between 7 and 9 AM on the 16th and continuing until late that afternoon, a new wave of floods occurred. These floodwaters were less concentrated in sediment and were therefore able to entrain new material and incise new channels into the flood and debris flow deposits from the previous days.[2] The debris flows moved rapidly, and many of them were highly destructive. Based on the maximum sizes of boulders measured in the flood deposits and the amount by which the flow on the outside of a bend was higher than that on the inside, geologists estimate the flow velocities to range from 3.3\u201314.5 meters per second (11\u201348\u00a0ft/s). These rapid, bouldery flows resulted in much of the observed destruction.[2] In addition to these debris flows, flash floods carrying extremely high sediment loads were very dangerous. Together the flash floods and debris flows destroyed hundreds of houses, bridges, and other structures. They incised new channels to depths of several meters into every alluvial fan delta on the Vargas state coastline, and they blanketed these fans with sediment.[4]"

        "header": "Caraballeda fan",
        "content": "Of the many communities that were affected by the disaster, the Caraballeda fan was one of the most hard-hit. The intensity of the disaster here is a combination of two factors. First, the Caraballeda fan was heavily urbanized, with many high-rise buildings and multistory houses. Second, it lies at the mouth of the Quebrada San Juli\u00e1n (Saint Julian Ravine), and this watershed produced very large boulders and a massive inundated area. Approximately 1/3 of the Caraballeda fan was inundated by debris flows, and the entire fan is built of past debris flow deposits.[2] The floods and debris flows of 1999 did not follow the eastern channel on Caraballeda. This channel, formed during the 1952 \nfloods, had been lined with concrete and designed to safely transport the flows into the sea. Instead, the debris flows overwhelmed the channel and the flows overtopped the banks wherever the channel changed direction. Once free of the culvert, the channel rapidly avulsed across the fan and spread debris throughout the community. These overbank flows demolished 2-story houses and destroyed the first two stories of apartment buildings. Farther down the fan, the debris flows routed themselves down streets. As the flows progressed, they left thinner and thinner deposits, though they often still exceeded 1 meter (3\u00a0feet) in thickness. After several avulsions, the channel roughly followed the pre-1951 flood path.[2] USGS geologists estimate the deposit volume to be at least 1.8 million cubic meters (from comparing topographic scans) or 1.9 million cubic meters (from field measurements). This is among the largest rainfall-induced debris flow deposits in recorded history, though volcanic-induced debris flows can be ten times as large. Subaqueous deposition extended the shoreline an additional 40\u201360 meters into the sea. The deposit thicknesses range from 4\u20135 meters (maximum of 5.3 meters) near the center of the fan to around 0.5 meters near the pre-flood shoreline. Maximum boulder sizes decreased towards the shoreline due to the decreasing slope of the fan.[2]"

Moreover, only some 1,000 bodies were recovered, with the rest swept to sea by the mud or buried in the landslides.[2] More than 8,000 homes and 700 apartment buildings were destroyed in Vargas, displacing up to 75,000 people.[2][3] The mudslides significantly altered more than 60 kilometres (37\u00a0mi) of the coastline in Vargas. Over 70% of the total population of Vargas State was affected by the disaster. Public services, like water, electricity, phone lines, and land transportation (roads and bridges) completely disappeared in some places. There were no supplies of food and water for months, so most of the population had to be evacuated. Looting and sacking occurred everywhere, forcing the military to implement martial law for more than a year.[2]"

        "content": "The disaster was of such magnitude that the president of the Red Cross initially presumed more than 50,000 dead. The first priority was to evacuate survivors; more than 100,000 people were ultimately evacuated.[3] After the disaster, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez advocated for other Venezuelans to open up their homes, and \"adopt a family\". Then-First Lady Marisabel Rodr\u00edguez de Ch\u00e1vez arranged the temporary sheltering of children that were feared orphaned in La Casona, the Presidential residence in Caracas.[6] Others offered help, including Major League Baseball shortstop Omar Vizquel, a native Venezuelan, who helped raise over $500,000 in relief funds.[2] After the initial emergency response, focus shifted to analyzing the causes of the disaster, and working to create a sustainable infrastructure for dealing with future torrential rains.[2] A disaster relief team from the United States headed up by New Mexico state Senator Joseph Carraro arrived with a medical team and supplies to assess the damage and help those who were displaced. Contact was made with Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico to determine if any radioactivity was included in the debris field. Water purification and sleeping units were provided.[2] The disaster clean-up soon became politicized. Ch\u00e1vez initially accepted assistance from anyone who offered, with the United States sending helicopters and dozens of soldiers that arrived two days after the disaster. When defense minister Ra\u00fal Salazar accepted the United States offer of further aid that included 450 Marines and naval engineers aboard the USS Tortuga, which was setting sail to Venezuela, Ch\u00e1vez told Salazar to decline the offer since \"[i]t was a matter of sovereignty\". Salazar became angry and assumed that Ch\u00e1vez's opinion was influenced by talks with Fidel Castro; though he complied with Ch\u00e1vez's order.[1] As part of its medical internationalism, Cuba provided medical support after the landslides.[7]:\u200a131\u200a Cuba sent a 450-member medical brigade, which remained in Venezuela after the conclusion of the emergency.[8]:\u200a162\u200a This experience contributed to Ch\u00e1vez's view that Cuba would be an important partner in the Ch\u00e1vez administration's foreign policy.[7]:\u200a131 Despite initial dispersals of emergency funds, receiving tens of millions of dollars from international organizations and the announcement of reconstruction plans, little came of the process and Ch\u00e1vez grew distracted with political squabbles, abandoning attention on the tragedy with recovery ultimately halting.[1] Survivors eventually left their refugee areas and returned to their homes in an attempt to rebuild.[1] By 2006, the state was back to its pre-disaster population level, and projects were slowly being carried out to rebuild damaged infrastructure.[5] Over a decade after the tragedy, thousands remained homeless and the value of real estate in zones untouched by the floods declined by as much as 70%, due to the destruction of infrastructure.[1][2] Orion\u00a0[es], a Rottweiler, was officially recognized for his role in rescuing people during the tragedy. A mudslide forced Orion and his owner Mauricio P\u00e9rez to leave their home and go to a safer place. They came across a young girl trapped by turbulent water. Orion guided the girl to shore by swimming at her side, then jumped back in to pull a second girl out of the water. He then helped eight children climb to high places. He spent Wednesday night and part of Thursday morning saving 37 people from drowning, ranging from a girl of 8 years old to an elderly man of 80 years old.[9] He was awarded the Medal \"Honor The Value\" and a certificate for the role he played. He also received plaques and medals from private institutions and governments, international tributes and recognition by the Grand Lodge of Masonry in Venezuela. On 1 December 2008, Orion died of intestinal gastroenteritis.[10] Three films were made about the tragedy by Venezuelan filmmakers, all released in 2011; this is said to show the lasting impact of the tragedy that people were still sharing these narratives, especially in a nation with a poor cinema industry.[11]"

The Australian region between 90\u00b0E and 160\u00b0E is officially monitored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency, and the Papua New Guinea National Weather Service, while others like the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also monitor the basin. Each tropical cyclone year within this basin starts on 1 July and runs throughout the year, encompassing the tropical cyclone season, which runs from 1 November and lasts until 30 April each season. Within the basin, most tropical cyclones have their origins within the South Pacific convergence zone or within the Northern Australian monsoon trough, both of which form an extensive area of cloudiness and are dominant features of the season. Within this region a tropical disturbance is classified as a tropical cyclone when it has 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) that wrap halfway around the low level circulation centre, while a severe tropical cyclone is classified when the maximum 10-minute sustained wind speeds are greater than 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph)."

Later, satellite imagery began in the basin in the 1959-60 season, although it was not continuous until 1970. In Western Australia in particular, the lack of population centers, shipping lanes, radars, and offshore stations meant that storms were tracked infrequently. After the onset of satellite imagery, the Dvorak technique was used to estimate storms' intensities and locations.[3] Each of three tropical cyclone warning centres (TCWCs) of the Bureau of Meteorology in Perth, Darwin and Brisbane used its own tropical cyclone naming list until the 2008\u201309 season, when the three TCWCs started to use the single Australian national naming list. From the 2020\u201321 season, the three TCWCs were unified into one single TCWC which still monitors all tropical cyclones that form within the Australian region, including any within the areas of responsibility of TCWC Jakarta or TCWC Port Moresby.[4] Later in 2021, the Australian tropical cyclone warning centre was officially named as TCWC Melbourne.[5]"

These four regions are named the Western region, the Northwestern sub-region, the Northern region and the Eastern region. The Australian region overall averages eleven tropical cyclones in a season, and the bureau assesses the region as a whole to have a high level of accuracy when forecasting tropical cyclone activity.[6] The Western region encompasses the area east of 90\u00b0E and west of 125\u00b0E.[6] The region covers the eastern Indian Ocean including the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island, and waters off Western Australia west of Kuri Bay. The region also covers waters off Indonesia that include the main islands of Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Sumba, Flores and the western half of Timor. The region averages seven tropical cyclones in a season, and the bureau assesses the region to have a low level of accuracy when forecasting tropical cyclone activity.[6] The Northwestern sub-region encompasses the area east of 105\u00b0E, west of 130\u00b0E and north of 25\u00b0S.[6] The sub-region covers waters off Western Australia north of Shark Bay, and extends westward to Christmas Island. The sub-region also covers waters off Indonesia as far west as Java and as far east as Timor. The sub-region averages five tropical cyclones in a season, and the bureau assesses the sub-region to have a moderate level of accuracy when forecasting tropical cyclone activity.[6] The Northern region encompasses the area east of 125\u00b0E and west of 142.5\u00b0E.[6] The region covers the Timor Sea, the Banda Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. The region averages three tropical cyclones in a season, and the bureau assesses the region to have a very low level of accuracy when forecasting tropical cyclone activity.[6] The Eastern region encompasses the area east of 142.5\u00b0E and west of 160\u00b0E.[6] The region covers waters east of Torres Strait and includes the Coral Sea and the Tasman Sea. Lord Howe Island lies within the region, but Norfolk Island lies east of the region, although the bureau continues to monitor tropical cyclones when they are a threat to the external territory.[7] The region also covers waters off Papua New Guinea and western parts of the Solomon Islands. The region averages four tropical cyclones in a season, and the bureau assesses the region to have a low level of accuracy when forecasting tropical cyclone activity.[6]"

Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts were hit especially hard by this storm. Boston received a record-breaking 27.1 inches (69\u00a0cm) of snow; Providence also broke a record with 27.6 inches (70\u00a0cm);[3] Atlantic City broke an all-time storm accumulation with 20.1 inches (51\u00a0cm); two Philadelphia suburban towns in Chester County received 20.2 inches (51\u00a0cm), while the City of Philadelphia received 16.0 inches (41\u00a0cm).[5] Nearly all economic activity was disrupted in the worst-hit areas.

These storms resulted in lightning and thunder accompanying the snowfall as it fell at 4 inches (10\u00a0cm) an hour at times."

        "content": "One of the major problems with the Blizzard of 1978 was the lack of foreknowledge about the storm's severity. Weather forecasting in New England is difficult, and meteorologists had developed a reputation as being inaccurate. Forecasting techniques and technology had improved dramatically in the 1970s, but the public was still quite skeptical. Snow failed to arrive in Monday's pre-dawn hours as predicted, and many locals felt it to be another failed forecast\u2014despite the accuracy of National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters' predictions concerning the Great Blizzard\u2014and they went to work and school as normal. Because of this, people had neither time nor incentive to prepare.  The region was already reeling after storms in January 1978 that left nearly two feet of snow in some areas of New England,[9] and had caused the collapse of the roof of the Hartford Civic Center.[10] The government of Massachusetts had a system for notifying major employers to send employees home early in the event of heavy storms. Thousands of employees were sent home starting in the early afternoon of February 6,[11] but thousands more were still caught by the storm. Some did not make it home for several days.  Many people were stranded in their cars along roads throughout New England. Fourteen people died on I-95 near Boston because snow piled high enough to prevent poisonous exhaust fumes from escaping from their idling vehicles. I-95 eventually had to be evacuated by cross-country skiers and snowmobilers. More than 3,500 cars were found abandoned and buried on roads during the cleanup. This number excludes the countless other vehicles buried in driveways, on the sides of streets, and in parking lots. Other transportation links were disrupted and shut down throughout the region, stranding public-transit commuters in city centers. Snowplows were also stranded in traffic as the snow continued to fall. At one point on I-93 north of Boston, a jackknifed tractor trailer blocked traffic in both directions, with a similar event occurring on Route 128 near Route 138 in Canton. The Neponset River also flooded I-93 in Milton, causing the highway's complete closure. A massive effort was made to clear Logan Airport runways for 200 National Guard troops' arrival on 27 C-130 and C-141 military flights from Fort Bragg and Fort Devens, who were called out by the governor. Some 11,666 college-hockey fans in Boston Garden, then the site of the 26th edition of the annual \"Beanpot\" college ice hockey tournament, held at the time of the blizzard's outbreak, found weather much different from what they had expected. Some spectators spent the next few days living at the arena, eating hot dogs, and sleeping in the bleachers and locker rooms.[12] Because of the blizzard, the second round of the Beanpot that year was not held until March 1, 1978, the latest date ever for the tournament's concluding games. Throughout eastern Massachusetts, automobile traffic was banned for the remainder of the week. Thousands of people walked and skied on the quiet city streets and over the frozen Charles River. This blizzard was one of the worst in Rhode Island's history, catching off guard many residents and the state government. Although Governor J. Joseph Garrahy had ordered an emergency evacuation of all public buildings, shortly before noon on February 6, too many people had lagged. Providence County, Rhode Island, was the hardest hit by the blizzard; the towns of Lincoln, Smithfield, Woonsocket, and North Smithfield all reported totals of at least 40 inches (100\u00a0cm) snow.[3] In New York City, it was one of the rare times that a snowstorm closed the schools; the New York City Board of Education closed schools for snow again only once in the next 18 years, on April 7, 1982.[13] Most suburban districts in the area close for snow several times each winter, but they rarely do in the city itself because of relatively easy access to subways, whose ability to run is not appreciably affected by moderate snowstorms.[citation needed] The New York Knicks were forced to postpone a basketball game for the first time ever, due to the airports being closed and the Portland Trail Blazers being unable to arrive in time.[14] Many people were caught in the storm while driving, and many others were trapped in their homes and workplaces, with snow drifts of up to 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m), in some places blocking the exits. In many cases, those who had become ill or had been injured during the storm had to be taken to hospitals by snowmobile. Other people left their homes and went for help by cross-country skis and sleds. The storm caused coastal flooding. The fierce northeast winds from the storm\u2014with the low-pressure area stalled off the island of Martha's Vineyard\u2014combined with high tides and storm surge, resulting from the storm's low pressure. This sent water over low land along the shores of Long Island Sound, Cape Cod Bay, and other bodies of water, causing some of the worst recorded coastal flooding. The flood continued through two days of tide cycles, a total of four successive high tides. Thousands of homes throughout coastal Massachusetts were damaged or destroyed, as was \"Motif Number 1\", in Rockport, an often-painted fisherman's shack renowned in art circles.[15] (A replica was constructed later the same year.)[16] The Peter Stuyvesant,[17] a former Hudson River Day Line boat turned into a floating restaurant, was sunk in Boston Harbor. The region's fishing fleet was damaged by the storm.[18]"

Approximately 10,000 people moved into emergency shelters. Some 2,500 houses were reported as seriously damaged or destroyed and 54 people were killed, many because of fallen electrical wires. Several people were found dead in downtown Providence, near the central police station; they may have been seeking shelter. Ten-year-old Peter Gosselin, of Uxbridge, Massachusetts, disappeared in the deep snow just feet from his home's front door and was not found until three weeks later.[23][24] Most of the Interstate highway system in the region was shut down, with some stretches not reopening to traffic until the following week. Air and rail traffic also were shut down. The snow fell too quickly for plow trucks to keep up. Plows were further hampered by the number of cars stuck on the roads. In Boston, the deep snow overwhelmed the city's sanitation department, because there was no more room along streets and sidewalks to put the snow; much of it was hauled to nearby harbors and dumped. Throughout the region, the high winds caused enormous drifts. A state of emergency was declared by governors in the affected states, and the United States National Guard was called out to help clear the roads. Additional troops were flown into Boston to help. It took six days to clear the roads of snow and of the cars and trucks buried in it. Governor Ella T. Grasso ordered all roads in Connecticut closed except for emergency travel, for three days;[25][26] Governor Michael Dukakis, of Massachusetts, did the same for his state.[27] The parking lot of Fenway Park was used for the National Guard to stage its efforts.  In Massachusetts, there was no travel ban again until 35 years later, when Governor Deval Patrick announced a travel ban on February 8, 2013, running from 4 p.m. that day until 4 p.m. the next day, because of the February 2013 nor'easter, whose snowfall rivaled and, in some places, beat that of the Blizzard of '78; in the \"Blizzard of '13\", the ban was declared before the worst hit; in the Blizzard of '78 this happened after the storm's worst. Extensive beach erosion occurred on the east coast of Massachusetts. Especially hard-hit were Cape Cod and Cape Ann, both on the eastern shore of Massachusetts. In Truro, on Cape Cod, the Atlantic Ocean broke through to the Pamet River for the first time during this storm, completely washing away the link between the North and South Pamet roads. The town chose not to reconstruct the link, though the right-of-way is open to pedestrians. Monomoy Island was split into north and south parts. Many homes along the New England and Long Island coastlines were destroyed or washed into the ocean. Many roofs collapsed across New England from snow load.[28]"

The season officially began on Wednesday, June\u00a01, 1977 and lasted until Wednesday, November\u00a030, 1977. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic basin. The first tropical cyclone of the season developed over the western Caribbean Sea on June\u00a013, 12\u00a0days after the start of the season. Three more organized during July and early August. Then, on August 29, the first named storm, Hurricane Anita formed and rapidly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane on September 1, before weakening slightly and striking Mexico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing 11\u00a0fatalities and leaving at least 25,000\u00a0people homeless. In addition to Anita, another notable tropical cyclone of this season was Hurricane Babe. The storm caused coastal flooding in southeastern Louisiana, resulting in $13\u00a0million (1977\u00a0USD) in damage.[nb 1] After moving inland, it spawned 14\u00a0tornadoes throughout Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In addition to Anita and Babe, five other tropical cyclones \u2013 hurricanes Clara, Dorothy, and Evelyn, as well as Tropical Storm Frieda and Tropical Depression Nine \u2013 left only minor impacts on land. Overall, the tropical cyclones of the season collectively caused 11\u00a0fatalities and more than $13\u00a0million in damage, excluding the remnants of Tropical Depression Nine, which led to 53\u00a0deaths and $203\u00a0million in losses due to flooding in the Southeastern United States, New Jersey, and New York."

Although 16\u00a0tropical depressions formed, it was a below average season because only six strengthened into tropical storms.[3] In terms of named storms, this was the least active season since 1965.[4] Five of these attained hurricane status, and one of the five eventually attained major hurricane status,[3] which is Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[4] The inactivity was attributed to an El Ni\u00f1o that began developing in August.[5] Three hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season, causing 11\u00a0deaths and $13\u00a0million in damage.[6][7][8] The last storm of the season, Tropical Depression Nine, dissipated on November\u00a07,[3] over three weeks before the official end of the season on November\u00a030.[1] Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1977\u00a0Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of a tropical depression on June\u00a013. Activity briefly halted, until two other tropical depressions developed in the second half of July. A fourth tropical depression formed in early August.[3] Later that month, Hurricane Anita developed on August\u00a029. It was the latest in the season for a first named storm to form in the satellite era.[9] September, the climatological peak of hurricane season, was its most active month.[7] Five tropical cyclones developed, including two tropical depressions,[3] and hurricanes Babe, Clara, and Dorothy.[7] There were also five tropical cyclones in October \u2013 three tropical depressions,[3] Hurricane Evelyn, and Tropical Storm Frieda.[7] The final tropical cyclone of the season, Tropical Depression Nine, developed between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda on November\u00a03 and dissipated by November\u00a07.[3] The season's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 25, which was the lowest ACE value since 1946. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.[4]"

Later that day, the storm had intensified into a hurricane. Although intensification briefly slowed, rapid deepening occurred from September\u00a01 to the following day, when Anita peaked as a Category\u00a05 hurricane with winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h).[3] The storm weakened slightly to a Category\u00a04 hurricane before making landfall near Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas.[7] It rapidly weakened inland, decreasing to tropical depression intensity early on September\u00a03. However, Anita remained intact across Mexico and reached the eastern Pacific Ocean as a depression.[3] Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone, the precursor to Anita dropped light rainfall in Florida.[10] Gusty winds and storm surge effected Louisiana. At Grand Isle, storm tides 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) above normal resulted in hundreds of families being asked to evacuate. Numerous coastal highways in Texas, including portions of State Highway 87, were closed due to above normal tides.[11] Precipitation reached 4.97 inches (126\u00a0mm) in Rio Grande City.[10] In Mexico, the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall.[7][12] The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico, with about 25,000 people left homeless. The roofs of most buildings were destroyed near the location of Anita's landfall.[13] The highest amount of precipitation observed during the storm was 15.2 inches (390\u00a0mm) at Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas.[7] Flooding and mudslides killed eleven people in the state.[6] Overall damage is unknown.[7]"

The storm curved north-northeastward and by early on the following day, it was upgraded to a hurricane. Around that time, Babe peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).

However, Babe continued to move northeastward and then east-northeastward across the Southeastern United States until dissipating early on September\u00a09.[3] Babe produced light to moderate rainfall across much of the Southern United States. In Louisiana, precipitation peaked at 10.99 inches (279\u00a0mm) near Lafayette.[14] Flooding damage was primarily to crops, mainly sugar cane.[7] Six tornadoes were spawned in Louisiana, including one near Hammond that severely damage a country store and knocked six wood-frame homes off their foundations. Damage from this tornado alone reached $2.5\u00a0million.[8][15] In other states, Babe brought flash flooding along its path due to rainfall exceeding 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) in Mississippi, northwestern Georgia, and western North Carolina.[7] Overall, Babe caused about $13\u00a0million in damage, but no deaths.[8]"

The depression initially drifted east-northeastward and soon moved offshore. After passing south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on September\u00a06, it began to organize while accelerating just north of due east. At 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Clara. The storm quickly strengthened, becoming a hurricane only 12\u00a0hours later.[16] Strong wind shear caused Clara to weaken back to a tropical storm on September\u00a09. Thereafter, the storm executed a cyclonic loop near Bermuda. By late on September\u00a010, Clara accelerated northeastward and became extratropical at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011.[16] In its early stages, the storm dropped light rainfall in the Southeastern United States, peaking at 3.53 inches (90\u00a0mm) in Beaufort, South Carolina.[17] Additionally, Clara produced 0.55 inches (14\u00a0mm) of precipitation in Bermuda.[18] The remnants reached Canada and produced winds of 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, which knocked over campers, uprooted trees, damaged barns, and caused power outages in the area.[19]"

Later that day, a reconnaissance aircraft reported a surface circulation near Swan Island, Honduras.[7] Thus, a tropical depression developed at 1800\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016. The depression moved slowly westward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Frieda on October\u00a017, while passing south of Swan Island.[3] Frieda continued to intensify until peaking with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,005\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg) early on October\u00a018.

Around that time, the storm passed south of Swan Island, where it produced 4.46 inches (113\u00a0mm) in a 30\u2011hour period. On Grand Cayman, 5.42 inches (138\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell in 36\u00a0hours.[7]"

        "content": "A tropical depression formed between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda on November\u00a03. Initially, the depression moved northeastward, though on November\u00a04, a building high pressure area forced it to track north of due west. Eventually, an upper-level low situated over the Southern United States caused the depression to re-curve north-northwestward. Late on November\u00a07, the depression made landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina. By early on the following day, the depression degenerated into a low pressure area while located over eastern Virginia. The remnants continued northeastward across the Mid-Atlantic and New England, before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while offshore of Maine on November\u00a011.[25] Moisture from Tropical Depression Nine and a low pressure area that tracked across the Southeastern United States resulted in heavy rainfall over western North Carolina and western Virginia, with up to 11.63 inches (295\u00a0mm) at Idlewild in the former.[25] In North Carolina, flooding destroyed 384\u00a0homes, 382 miles (615\u00a0km) of highways, and 12\u00a0dams. Flooding was considered the worst in Yancey County, where nearly every bridge was washed out. Sixteen counties in the western portions of the state were declared disaster areas.[26] The depression also produced 5 to 9 inches (130 to 230\u00a0mm) of rainfall in northern Georgia. Eighteen bridges were destroyed and twenty-seven others were damaged. In Virginia, 100\u00a0homes were destroyed by flooding, with about the same amount suffering major damage. Similar impact was reported in Tennessee. Strong winds and storm tides in New Jersey caused extensive damage. Overall, the flooding event caused 53\u00a0deaths, 39\u00a0in Georgia,[27] 13\u00a0in North Carolina,[26] and 1 in Tennessee. Damage totaled $203\u00a0million, $100\u00a0million of which was incurred in New Jersey alone.[27]"

Later in June, a tropical depression formed in the west-central Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a013. It headed north-northwestward and made landfall in Texas by the following day. The system rapidly dissipated after moving inland. The third tropical depression of the season developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on July\u00a017. After tracking northward, the depression struck near Mobile, Alabama on July\u00a018. By the following day, it dissipated in central Mississippi. In late July, another depression developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on July\u00a025. No further strengthening occurred and by the following day, it dissipated north of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[3] A tropical depression developed near the west coast of Africa on August\u00a01. The system tracked westward for three days without intensifying and dissipated on August\u00a04. The next tropical depression formed well west-southwest of Cape Verde on September\u00a017. After remaining disorganized, it dissipated to the east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles about three days later. Tropical Depression Four developed in the Bay of Campeche on September\u00a022. However, the depression remained weak and made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas at around 1000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023. Later that day, it dissipated while barely inland.[3] By October\u00a01, another tropical depression formed east of the Lesser Antilles. It headed west-northwestward and dissipated on October\u00a03, before reaching the Windward Islands. Tropical Depression Six developed in the central Atlantic Ocean on October\u00a02. It briefly headed east-southeastward, before curving northwestward on October\u00a04. The system dissipated later that day. Another tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico east of the Texas and Mexico border on October\u00a024. It tracked northeastward without intensification and made landfall in southeast Louisiana on October\u00a025, while still a tropical depression.

The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research reported that an entire summer's worth of rain fell within one day in what it described as a 1-in-200-year event.[6][7] The event is considered to be the worst flooding in Auckland's modern history.[8] Over the following days other areas of the upper North Island were impacted.[9] Minister of Finance Grant Robertson stated at the time that the event was New Zealand's costliest non-earthquake event ever,[10] although this record was broken only two weeks later when Cyclone Gabrielle impacted the country.[11]"

Tar seals and concrete surfaces on roads, carparks, and buildings also prevent rainwater from dispersing into the ground, causing water to pool up and surfaces to flood during heavy rain events.[16][17] Significant flooding events had previously occurred in Auckland in August 2021 and March 2022.[18][19]"

By 10:00 pm on 27 January, other locations in Auckland had reported record daily rainfalls before the day was over; the Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) had had 238.4\u00a0mm (9.39\u00a0in), Albany had had 260.6\u00a0mm (10.26\u00a0in), and M\u0192\u00c5ngere had had 242\u00a0mm (9.5\u00a0in).[20] The highest daily rainfall occurred in M\u0192\u00c5ngere, with a total of 265\u00a0mm (10.4\u00a0in).[21] Metservice also reported that 299.5\u00a0mm (11.79\u00a0in) of rain fell at Albert Park in a span of 34 hours.[22] The peak 2-minute rainfall in M\u0192\u00c5ngere was 4.2\u00a0mm (0.17\u00a0in).[23] Some parts of the city had over 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) of rain within a week.[24] 27 January was declared the wettest day in Auckland on record, with 258\u00a0mm (10.2\u00a0in) of rain at Auckland Airport exceeding the previous record of 161.8\u00a0mm (6.37\u00a0in).[25][20] January 2023 was declared the wettest month ever in central Auckland by NIWA, with the total of 539 millimetres (21.2 inches) surpassing the 420\u00a0mm (17\u00a0in) recorded in February 1869.[26] Some flooding also occurred in the Northland region on 27 January.[27] On 28 and 29 January, the rain spread south of Auckland, causing widespread flooding in the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions,[2] with some flooding in the Gisborne region.[27] On 31 January, NIWA forecast that the atmospheric river moving through the upper North Island would once again reach Auckland between midnight and dawn. NIWA also reported that a subtropical low-pressure system was predicted to hit Northland that afternoon.[28]"

Part of the new caucus was the revival of the role of Minister for Auckland, partly in response to the flooding in the city. Michael Wood was given the role.[108] On Thursday 2 February,[a] New Zealand's head of state King Charles III sent his condolences to the victims of the floods.[109]"

        "content": "Brown declared a state of emergency immediately after the AEM advised him to do so, hours after the extreme weather began, but was widely criticised for his response, which was said to show hesitation and a lack of presence.[110][111] When questioned on the poor level of preparedness on RNZ by Kim Hill, in a rare public interview, he was unable to confirm whether or not text alerts had been sent out to Aucklanders (which Hill had to clarify to him that they had not been) or if tap water was safe to consume. He then claimed it was \"a bit early\" and \"not helpful\" to ask if the floods were caused by climate change.[112] When she asked if his administration's \"level of inability to cope was terrifying\" he answered \"it's definitely worrying. But this is an unprecedented event. It will be interesting to see just how well prepared Wellington is when the earthquake strikes.\" Wellington as a city is extremely vulnerable to earthquakes; this prompted condemnation for his mocking remarks. Hill challenged him for what she described as \"a low blow under the circumstances.\"[113] He then stated that the delay in declaring an emergency was due to how busy Fire and Emergency workers were, and not something he was responsible for.[112] Brown expressed frustration at fellow officials, accusing them of not providing information to him in a timely manner.[114] At 3:30\u00a0pm on Saturday 28 January, Chris Hipkins and Wayne Brown attended a press conference in West Auckland. Brown was criticised for his performance during the conference as he defended his response to the floods.[115] National Party MP Gerry Brownlee, who led the Government's response to the earthquakes in Canterbury, Christchurch, and Kaik\u2248\u00e7ura, accused Brown of \"washing his hands\" of any responsibility, and said that his response to the event was \"somewhat inexplicable\".[116] On 30 January, Brown announced an inquiry will take place into the response from both him and his office in the first 24 to 48 hours of the event.[107] Following the event, there were calls from the public for Wayne Brown to resign as Mayor of Auckland, with a petition for his resignation being set up on Change.org.[117] On Tuesday 31 January, leaked text messages between Brown and a tennis-based WhatsApp group chat were reported on by the NZ Herald, where he complained on 28 January that \"I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got to deal with media drongos over the flooding tomorrow so sadly no tennis for me tomorrow.\"[118] On Wednesday 1 February, the NZ Herald reported on a phone call which occurred between Brown and a Herald reporter on 30 January, where Brown exclaimed \"Don't fuck me over\" and \"I am the mayor for three years. You can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do anything about that.\"[114] Brown expressed that he felt misunderstood, and complained about the lack of media coverage of his generally unannounced visits to impacted areas,[114] while also later expressing regret at the leaked conversations, and admitted he needs to improve his communication.[119]"

After the agency's chief executive was spoken to by Deputy Mayor of Auckland Desley Simpson, group manager of parking services and compliance John Strawbridge said all fines issued between 2:00 pm on Friday and 9:00 am on Wednesday 1 February would be waived.[122] The Civil Defence emergency alert text messages were sent to Aucklanders about the rain 48 hours after the city was hit by the devastating floods.[43] National Emergency Management Agency, which is a Government agency, received criticism for the 48 hour delay, as the flooding first struck on the evening of 27 January and the alerts were sent out at 7:47 pm on 29 January.[123] The event sparked discussions about the many natural rivers and wetlands across Auckland city that had been paved over with largely waterproof chipseal during development, with calls being made to daylight Auckland's streams and rivers in order to better cope with heavy rainfall events.[124]"

The group's formation was in response to hundreds of homes in West Auckland being yellow and red-stickered, rendering them uninhabitable as a result of flood damage. The group's chairman Lyall Carter said that many of its members' homes had experienced flooding in both 2021 and January 2023. Following Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023, Labour Member of Parliament and former cabinet minister Phil Twyford called on the Government to buy out flood damaged homes in the Te Atat\u2248\u00b4 on the grounds that frequent flooding made it \"irresponsible and impractical\" to rebuild.[125][126] In February 2023, the Government confirmed that it was designing a managed retreat strategy for those who lost their homes as a result of the Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods and Cyclone Gabrielle. The Government also indicated that it would incorporate managed retreat into its Climate Change Adaptation Bill. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins also confirmed that he would meet with Climate Change Minister James Shaw to incorporate climate change adaptation into disaster responses.[126][127] In early October 2023, the Auckland Council voted unanimously to accept a proposed cost sharing arrangement with the Government to fund over NZ$2 billion in flood recovery and resilience works. This deals including buying out hundreds of \"category 3\" flood-damaged properties.[128]"

The review had been commissioned by Mayor Brown to examine the responses of all parties, including himself, professionals, and the Government to the floods. The review was led by former Police Commissioner Mike Bush. It found that the council's emergency management system was unprepared for the floods, that Council staff were aware of gaps in preparing for superstorm emergencies but had failed to act, that communications and relationships between key Council and civil defence policy-makers were \"insufficiently inclusive\" in critical early stages, a failure of leadership among Council and civil defence senior leaders, and that a centralised planning and delivery model weakened local knowledge that would have better supported local communities. The Bush review covered the 48-hour period from January 27 but focused on the first 12 hours of the emergency response. It made 17 recommendations to the council for future extreme weather events, including proposing a separate review into Auckland Emergency Management's prevention, preparedness and planning, the development of new standard operating procedures for extreme weather events in Auckland, better training and resources for emergency management personnel, and more frequent emergency management training exercises. Brown accepted the recommendations of the Bush Report and stated that he had \"dropped the ball\" during the events of 27 January 2023.[129][130]"

        "content": " Hurricane Ophelia was the most intense hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season. The seventeenth tropical cyclone, sixteenth tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane, Ophelia originated in a tropical wave in the central Atlantic, forming approximately midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a017. Tracking generally west-northwestward, Ophelia was upgraded to a tropical storm on September\u00a021, and reached an initial peak of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a022. As the storm entered a region of higher wind shear it began to weaken, and was subsequently downgraded to a remnant low on September\u00a025. The following day, however, the remnants of the system began to reorganize as wind shear lessened, and on September\u00a027, the National Hurricane Center once again began advisories on the system. Moving northward, Ophelia regained tropical storm status early on September\u00a028, and rapidly deepened to attain its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) several days later. The system weakened as it entered cooler sea surface temperatures and began a gradual transition to an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed by October\u00a03. Following the development of Ophelia, numerous storm watches and warnings were issued for the northeastern Caribbean Islands. Residents were urged to prepare for strong winds and substantial flooding. As the system made its closest approach, Ophelia produced several inches of rainfall, leading to mudslides and several road rescues. While light rain totals and gusty winds below tropical storm force were recorded on the island of Bermuda, storm surge and dangerous rip currents along the coast caused minimal damage. In Newfoundland, heavy rainfall contributed to floods that destroyed roads and many buildings. Following Ophelia's transition into an extratropical cyclone, residents across Europe were urged to prepare for strong winds in excess of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) in some locations, as well as rainfall accumulations up to 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm). In northern Ireland, a combination of moisture and significantly cooler weather produced several inches of snow across the region, cutting electricity to hundreds. Overall, there were no deaths reported in association with Ophelia, and damage was minimal."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The formation of Hurricane Ophelia is attributed in part to a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa in mid-September. As the wave tracked westward, it began to interact with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and was subsequently introduced with a low chance of tropical development in the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook.[1] Though atmospheric wind shear was only marginally favorable, the cloud pattern organized, and a surface low-pressure area developed in association with the disturbance. Deep shower and thunderstorm activity continued to fire as the disturbance moved in a general westward motion, and it was assessed with a high chance of development by early on September\u00a019.[2] Following satellite trends and data from the Advanced Scatterometer, the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1800\u00a0UTC the following day, while positioned roughly 1,300\u00a0mi (2,100\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles, and to a tropical storm six hours later.[3] Tropical Storm Ophelia continued to intensify as it moved west-northwest. Curved convective bands became prominent in the northern semicircle of the cyclone, and deep convection developed near the center.[4] This intensification trend was short-lived, however, as increased wind shear from a nearby upper-level low caused the low-level center to become partially exposed. Despite the poor presentation on satellite imagery, data from a nearby buoy revealed that the system was stronger than previously thought, with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a022. As the upper-level low moved closer to Ophelia, inducing increasingly unfavorable shear on the storm, it caused the low-pressure area to become completely void of thunderstorms. While deep convection waned significantly early on September\u00a023, it made a comeback by that afternoon, and an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft found 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) winds in the system, much stronger than the intensity of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) the system was assessed with before the flight. This intensity did not maintain long as the cloud pattern once again became disorganized. The low-level center became exposed once again during the pre-dawn hours of September\u00a025, and without the return of organized shower and thunderstorm activity, led to the NHC declaring Ophelia as a remnant area of low pressure, while situated 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) east of the northern Leeward Islands.[3] Though the low-level center dissipated later that afternoon, a well-defined mid-level center lingered. The National Hurricane Center initially assessed the remnants of Ophelia with a low chance of regeneration as deep convection fired in association with the low,[5] but these odds were subsequently increased to a medium chance by the afternoon hours of September\u00a026.[6] A new low-level circulation developed within the well-organized cloud mass, and the system was once again given a high chance of tropical cyclone formation that evening.[7] Following an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance flight into the system, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ophelia at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a027, and was once again upgraded to a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) 18\u00a0hours later. As the cyclone reached the western periphery of the subtropical ridge positioned across the central Atlantic, it began to curve northward and intensify once again. Deep convection blossomed atop the center late on September\u00a028, and microwave imagery depicted the development of an eye.[8] Upper-level outflow expanded in all four quadrants of the cyclone by the afternoon hours of September\u00a029,[9] and satellite intensity estimates continued to rise, prompting the NHC to upgrade Ophelia to a Category\u00a01 hurricane by 1800\u00a0UTC that day.[3] An unexpected period of rapid deepening began early on September\u00a030 as a well-defined eye became clearly visible on satellite imagery.[10] Ophelia intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) by 0600\u00a0UTC and became the season's third major hurricane\u2014a Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale\u2014twelve hours later. Cloud tops continued to cool in the system's eyewall late on October\u00a01, with cloud tops in the eye of the system warming. Ophelia intensified into a Category\u00a04 hurricane at 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02 and simultaneously attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (940\u00a0hPa; 28\u00a0inHg) as it passed east of Bermuda. Weakening ensued the following day as the hurricane entered cooler sea surface temperatures and an environment characterized by significantly more stable air. Ophelia weakened below major hurricane intensity by 1800\u00a0UTC and became a tropical storm for the final time by 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a03. The system lost its tropical characteristics and was subsequently declared an extratropical cyclone four hours later while positioned just southwest of Newfoundland. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger weather system by the afternoon hours of the following day.[3]"

        "content": "Though the center of Ophelia remained 205\u00a0mi (330\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles,[11] its outer bands produced heavy rains across the region. In Dominica, more than 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain fell over parts of the country, triggering flooding along several rivers. Nearly 1,600\u00a0people were stranded and many cars were washed away by the flooding, while landslides severed access to several communities.[12] Several businesses and schools were closed in preparation of the storm.[13] As Ophelia made its closest approach to the region, heavy rainfall submerged Canefield Airport, and numerous roads, buildings and farms were damaged, leaving residents trapped. Gusty winds, reaching 37\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h) at times, and scattered thunderstorms affected portions of Guadeloupe.[14] Following Ophelia's upgrade to hurricane status on September\u00a029, the Bermuda Weather Service (BWS) issued a tropical storm watch for the entirety of the island.[15] Over the following days, the threat of damaging winds gradually decreased as the storm's forecast track took it far enough east of the territory to spare the region of a direct hit. Correspondingly, the BWS discontinued the watch on the evening of October\u00a01.[16] Four flights from the United States to Bermuda were canceled due to stormy conditions. Along the coast, the Department of Parks raised high surf warnings for the entire south shore and temporarily closed Horseshoe Beach. Additionally, a few local events were postponed.[17] Passing roughly 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km) east of Bermuda, the outer bands of Ophelia produced 0.38\u00a0in (9.7\u00a0mm) of rain and wind gusts up to 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) across the islands.[18] On October\u00a01, Environment Canada issued a tropical storm watch for the Avalon Peninsula.[19] Throughout Newfoundland, residents were warned of heavy rains approaching 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm).[20] Striking the region just over a year after Hurricane Igor, Ophelia revealed that repairs made in the wake of the previous hurricane were occasionally inadequate. Six roads on the Burin and Bonavista peninsulas were shut down during the storm; two of the works sustained significant damage. Several culverts installed after Igor were washed away by Ophelia.[21] While Ophelia was still impacting Newfoundland, forecasters in the United Kingdom warned residents that the remnants of the storm would bring unsettled weather to the nation within a few days.[22] In the midst of a record-breaking heat wave, with temperatures reaching an all-time monthly record high of 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C), the storm was expected to bring much cooler weather across the region. Strong winds and heavy rains were also anticipated, leading to the cancellation of ferry services. Plummeting temperatures in association with the remnants of the storm were expected to produce snowfall across the United Kingdom as well.[23] In County Donegal the first snows of the season fell, leaving hundreds of residents without electricity.[24]"

        "content": " The 2023 Pacific typhoon season was the fourth consecutive below-average season and became the third-most inactive typhoon season on record in terms of named storms, with just 17 named storms developing, only ahead of 2010 and 1998. Despite the season occurring during an El Ni\u00f1o event, which typically favors activity in the basin, activity was abnormally low. This was primarily due to a consistent period of negative PDO, which typically discourages tropical storm formation in this basin.[1] The season was less active than the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season in terms of named storms, the fourth such season on record, after 2005, 2010 and 2020. The season's number of storms also did not exceed that of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season. Only ten became typhoons, with four strengthening further into super typhoons. However, it was very destructive, primarily due to Typhoon Doksuri which devastated the northern Philippines, Taiwan, and China in July, becoming the costliest typhoon on record as well as the costliest typhoon to hit mainland China, and Typhoon Haikui in September, which devastated China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The season was less active in Southeast Asia, with no tropical storm making landfall in mainland Vietnam (the third since the country's independence, after the 1976 and 2002 seasons).[2][3] The season ran throughout 2023, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Sanvu, formed on April 21, while its last named storm, Jelawat, dissipated on December 20. In May, Typhoon Mawar intensified into the first typhoon of the season on May 21, later becoming one of the strongest Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclones on record in May.[4] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100\u00b0E and 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two agencies which assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA)[nb 2] will name a tropical cyclone if it has 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) anywhere in the basin, while the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\u00a0(PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which are active in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), located between 135\u00b0E and 115\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N\u201325\u00b0N, regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC)[nb 3][nb 1] are given a number with a \"W\" suffix."

        "content": "During the year, several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies included the Tropical Storm Risk\u00a0(TSR) Consortium of University College London, PAGASA and Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau.[10] The first forecast was released by PAGASA on January 13, 2023, in their monthly seasonal climate outlook predicting the first half of 2023. They predicted that only 0\u20132 tropical cyclones were expected to form or enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility between January and March, while 2\u20134 tropical cyclones are expected to form between April and June. PAGASA also stated that weakening La Ni\u00f1a conditions could last until it transitions back into ENSO-neutral conditions afterwards.[10] On May 5, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) issued its first forecast for the 2023 season with moderate to strong El Ni\u00f1o expected to develop and persist through October, TSR predicted that tropical activity for 2023 will be above average predicting 29 named storms, 19 typhoons and 13 intense typhoons.[7] The TSR remained constant with their prediction except slightly decreasing the intense typhoon numbers to 12 in the July forecast.[8] In the last August forecast, the TSR increased the number of typhoons and intense typhoons to 20 and 14.[9]"

        "content": "The season began on March 4 with the formation of a tropical depression which formed near the equator, east of Singapore. The depression was short lived and was last noted three days later. The storm however, brought heavy rainfall across Malaysia, affecting about 50,000 people. A month later on April 7, the JMA began tracking a low-pressure area located in the Philippines Sea. On the same day the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression with the PAGASA naming the system Amang. The depression made three landfalls in Panganiban, Catanduanes; Presentacion, Camarines Sur; and Lagonoy, Camarines Sur, before weakening into a remnant low on April 13. Amang caused minor damage across the country however, no fatalities were reported.[12] Five days after Amang dissipated, the JMA began monitoring another disturbance located near Pohnpei. After slowly intensifying, the system reached tropical storm status and the system was named Sanvu by the JMA; becoming the first named storm in the basin. Sanvu however began to weaken after entering hostile environment. The storm weakened back into a tropical depression until it dissipated on April 25.[13] On May 5, a tropical depression was noted in the Sulu Sea by the JMA. The system crossed Palawan and entered the West Philippine Sea on the same day. The system continued to traverse the South China Sea before dissipating on May 7. On May 19, a tropical depression developed south-southwest of the Chuuk Islands. A few hours later, it became a tropical storm and was named Mawar. On the next day, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm, as the storm was getting better defined. A day later, Mawar was classified as a Category\u00a01-equivalent typhoon by the JTWC. The JMA followed suit and designated the system as a Typhoon on the same day; becoming the first typhoon of the year in the basin. Mawar later strengthened into a Category\u00a02-equivalent typhoon on May 22. Then, the storm began to explosively intensify and reached Category\u00a03-equivalent status on the same day. It further strengthened into a Category\u00a04-equivalent super typhoon on the next day as it approached Guam. Land interaction with Guam and an eyewall replacement cycle caused the storm to weaken slightly but eventually restrengthened after passing the northern tip of Guam on May 24. The next day, Mawar completed its eyewall replacement cycle and went on to reach its peak intensity of 295\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph), making it a very strong Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon. As Mawar entered the PAR which was named Betty by PAGASA, it encountered cooler oceans and increasing wind shear which caused it to weaken.[14] It also underwent yet another eyewall replacement cycle causing the storm to weaken further. It affected the eastern coast of Luzon and weakened to a severe tropical storm as it left the PAR on June 1. It affected the Okinawa Islands and finally turned extratropical south of Honshu on June 3.[15] On June 5, a low-pressure area was formed north of Palau, naming the system as Invest 98W. At the following day, it intensified and entered the Philippine area of responsibility, prompting PAGASA to name the storm as Chedeng at 08:00 UTC. The JTWC later followed suit and designated it as 03W. At 20:00 UTC, Chedeng was upgraded to a tropical storm, receiving the international name Guchol. Guchol later became a strong Category\u00a02-equivalent typhoon in the Philippine Sea, but the cold wake from Typhoon Mawar kept it from intensifying any further. As Guchol (Chedeng) exited the PAR, it weakened to a severe tropical storm, and continued northeastwards, avoiding the Japanese archipelago.[16] On July 13, A monsoon depression formed near Luzon. PAGASA noted the system and subsequently named the system Dodong. The system then crossed the island. The system then entered the South China Sea, where it became a tropical depression. Later, it became a tropical storm. It was named Talim. Talim moved through the South China Sea as it intensified. Near the coast of China, Talim reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02-equivalent typhoon. Talim slightly weakened before making landfall in China at 22:20 CST. About six hours later, Talim entered the Gulf of Tonkin and made a second landfall. On July 18, Talim dissipated inland.[17][18] On July 19, the JMA began tracking a disturbance in the Philippine Sea. On July 21, the JMA noticed it had begun to become more organized and it was upgraded into a tropical storm, with the name given being Doksuri. The PAGASA also noted the formation and gave it the name Egay. On July 23, the system began to intensify rapidly, and achieved typhoon status. Late on July 24, the JTWC classified it as a super typhoon. The next morning the PAGASA did the same thing as on that day it reached its peak of 1 minute sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph). Doksuri began to slow as it reached the northern Philippines. With dry air in the area, Doksuri started to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle. As a mid-range Category-4 typhoon, Doksuri made landfall over Fuga Island in Aparri, Cagayan. Hours later, it made another landfall in Dalupiri Island. The storm eventually began to de-intensify following the eyewall replacement. However, as it exited the region on July 27, it began reintensifying. It was now heading toward Taiwan and China with 1 minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph. On July 28, it made its last landfall in China; however, it rapidly began to weaken. On July 29, Doksuri dissipated inland over China.[19] After Doksuri devastated several countries, JMA announced another formation of a low-pressure area in the Pacific Ocean. The JMA later issued a warning, declaring it as a tropical depression. The system also indicated that the system is in a favorable environment for development. On July 27, the JTWC subsequently issued advisories for the system and classified the system as Tropical Depression 06W. Despite its disorganized structure, both agencies upgraded the system into a tropical storm, with JMA assigning the name Khanun. Khanun later entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), gaining the name Falcon by PAGASA. Tracking northward due to a nearby mid-level subtropical high-pressure area, Khanun intensified into a severe tropical storm. Over 24 hours, its maximum sustained wind speeds grew by 130\u00a0km/h (80 mph) and eventually reached a peak of 220\u00a0km/h (140 mph), equivalent to Category 4 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. As it left PAR on August 1, Khanun weakened slightly as it moved move closer to the Ryukyu Islands, battering them with heavy rain and strong winds. Khanun weakened further due to an ongoing eyewall replacement cycle, allowing its eye to grow massively, but degrading its overall structure. Following structural weakening, the JMA and JTWC downgraded Khanun to a severe tropical storm, with estimated winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60 mph). After passing north of Tokunoshima, the storm accelerated to the southeast. Satellite imagery showed a consolidating LLCC with formative convective banding and deep convection over the northern semicircle, the storm passed the southwestern island of Kyushu. Around 00:00 UTC on August 10, Khanun made landfall on Geojedo Islands in South Korea with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50 mph). The JMA continued to monitor Khanun as a tropical cyclone until early on August 11."

        "content": "On August 5, the JMA reported that a low-pressure area had formed east-northeast of Iwo Jima. Environmental conditions were marginally favorable to conduct a tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea temperatures, low vertical wind shear, and good outflow. Later that day, JMA named the system Lan as it strengthened into a tropical storm. Lan continues to strengthen more to achieve the peak intensity of 220\u00a0km/h (140 mph) by JTWC. After reaching its peak intensity, Lan started to track through colder waters, causing the typhoon to weaken significantly. Lan re-strengthened again into a Category-2 typhoon as it strengthened. The storm maintained its overall convective structure, but the waters beneath the cyclone cooled, prompting a quick weakening trend. Around 14:00 UTC on August 14, Lan made landfall on Cape Shionomisaki, Japan. Once inland, Lan weakened into a tropical storm over the region's rough terrain. Lan began to accelerate northeast through Sea of Japan while weakening. JMA declared the system as an extratropical low on August 17. In mid-August, two tropical disturbances were formed on either side of the basin. The first disturbance was recognized east of Taiwan on August 20. On the next day, the second one formed in the open waters of the Western Pacific. PAGASA expected that the low-pressure area near Taiwan would have a low chance of development. However, on the next day, PAGASA later recognized that the disturbance was named Goring after it was upgraded into a tropical depression. Meanwhile, in the open waters of the Pacific, JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 08W. While near the Philippines, JTWC gave the identifier for Goring as Tropical Depression 09W. On August 24, 09W was upgraded into a tropical storm, which gave the name Saola by the JMA. Saola began to move southwestwards through the Philippine Sea and continued to intensity to a typhoon. Being in warm sea surface temperature, Saola began to rapidly intensify as it loitered off the coast of Luzon. It reached the intensity of a Category-4 typhoon on August 27. After executing a south-southeastward turn over the Philippine Sea, Saola weakened to a Category-2 typhoon. However, on August 29, Saola regained strength and explosively intensified further into a Category-5 super typhoon. Saola crossed through the Babuyan Islands before it left the Philippine Area of Responsibility a few hours later. Saola remained a powerful super typhoon as it crossed through the South China Sea, and featured a clear and warm eye as it did so. As it drew closer to Hong Kong, Saola was struggling to complete an eyewall replacement cycle, resulting in some slight weakening. Before its approach, the Hong Kong Observatory had issued its Hurricane Signal No. 10 at 20:15 HKT (12:15 UTC), the first time to do so since Typhoon Mangkhut of 2018. On September 1, Saola passed south of Hong Kong and Macau as a mid-Category-4 typhoon, battering with strong winds and heavy rain. Saola weakened into a Category-3 as it made landfall in Guangdong, China on early Saturday. Once inland, Saola began to weaken into a severe tropical storm after landfall. On September 3, all agencies issued their final advisory as Saola dissipated that day. In the open waters of the basin, 08W received the name Damrey as it moved northward. Avoiding the Japanese islands, Damrey intensified into a Category-1 typhoon and severe tropical storm, respectively by the JTWC and JMA, well east of Japan. It then turned post-tropical on August 29. While Saola is exhibiting a counter-clockwise loop east of the Philippines, a new broad low-pressure area developed into a tropical depression on August 27, near the Northern Mariana Islands, while slowly drifting westward. On the next day, JMA immediately named the disturbance as Haikui. The JTWC began issuing advisories for Haikui thereafter and designated it as Tropical Depression 10W. Shortly after being named, Haikui rapidly intensified into a severe tropical storm status a few minutes later. It eventually entered PAR, giving the domestic name Hanna. Before landfall in Taiwan, Haikui strengthened into a Category-3 typhoon due to favorable conditions. Haikui then made landfall, in Taitung County, Taiwan on September 3, became the first typhoon to make landfall in that intensity since Typhoon Megi of 2016. The mountain ranges of Taiwan made it weakened to a Category-1 typhoon. It then moved erratically and made its second landfall in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Haikui weakened significantly and downgraded into a severe tropical storm. On September 5, Haikui made its third and final landfall in Dongshan County, Fujian as a weakening tropical storm. Therefore, JMA and the JTWC made their final advisory as Haikui dissipated on the next day. Overall, Haikui caused 16 deaths and a total of US$2.31\u00a0billion worth of damages throughout its lifetime. Just after Haikui strengthened into a tropical storm, another low-pressure area located far east of Guam began to form. On August 30, as the system steadily intensified, the JTWC started issuing advisories and designated the depression as Tropical Depression 11W. While moving northwest, 11W developed into a tropical storm, giving the name Kirogi. On September 2, Kirogi weakened back to a tropical depression. Its remnants would meander near Japan before dissipating on September 6. On September 4, an area of low pressure was formed in the northeast region of PAR. The LPA would later be named Ineng by PAGASA and Yun-yeung which replaced the name Kai-tak. Yun-yeung continued to move northward slowly as it approached central and eastern Japan. Yun-yeung was last noted over Suruga Bay near Shizuoka, Japan. It brought heavy rain across the wide areas of Japan, prompting warnings over the risk of flooding and mudslides. An area of low pressure formed near the Southern Philippines. On September 24, JMA recognized it as a tropical depression as it tracked westward. Around the same day, JTWC designated the system as 13W. It was tracking north-northwestward toward the Vietnam coast. The JMA last tracked the system on September 27. On September 27, a low-pressure area was formed near the Northern Mariana Islands. The JTWC later issued bulletins for any potential development in the upcoming days. It continued to move westwards, entering PAR where it was upgraded into a depression and named Jenny by PAGASA. A few hours later, JTWC gave the identifier for Jenny as Tropical Depression 14W. On the next day, JMA upgraded 14W into a tropical storm, assigning the name Koinu. Koinu moved west-northwestward while it intensified steadily. Being in the warm waters of the Philippine Sea, Koinu was upgraded into a Category-3 typhoon. Koinu weakened into a Category 2 yet it reintensified further into a Category-4 typhoon with 1-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140 mph) and a central pressure of 940 hPa (27.76 inHg). This caused Koinu to perform an eyewall replacement cycle, achieving its defined eye-like feature. Koinu then passed dangerously to Lanyu before making its first landfall in Hengchun, Taiwan. After its interaction with land, Koinu weakened again, downgrading to Category-3 strength. As it left PAR, Koinu further weakened into a Category-1 typhoon. As it tracked through the South China Sea, Koinu unexpectedly restrengthened back to Category-3 major typhoon for the second time. Koinu later passed closely to Hong Kong, which prompted the HKO to issue Increasing Storm Signal No. 9 at 19:00 (HKT). It was kept for 4 hours as it moved away from the country. As it moves through unfavorable conditions, Koinu starts to weaken again for the last time to a tropical storm. JMA and JTWC ceased advisories as Koinu dissipated over the coastal waters of Guangdong on October 10."

        "content": "A tropical depression was formed near the Federated States of Micronesia on October 6. The depression later gave its identifier from JTWC as Tropical Depression 15W. Although it was disorganized, the system continued to consolidate, and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Bolaven. On October 10, Bolaven was upgraded into a typhoon. The typhoon passed just south of Saipan and the Northern Mariana Islands. Bolaven later underwent explosive intensification in which it went from a 150\u00a0km/h (90 mph) Category 1-equivalent typhoon to a 260\u00a0km/h (160 mph) Category 5-equivalent super typhoon in 12 hours ending at 00:00 UTC on October 11, after leaving the Mariana Islands. However, shortly after peaking its intensity, Bolaven later weakened as it recurved northeastward. Bolaven then transitioned into an extratropical cyclone which prompted the JTWC to cease their bulletins. On October 13, a low-pressure area developed to the west of the Philippines. Due to the system being over warm waters and low vertical wind shear, a TCFA was announced on October 16. JTWC designated the said disturbance as 16W. On October 18, JMA formally named the system Tropical Storm Sanba as it continues to consolidate. Sanba later made landfall in Hainan on the following day. It weakened into a tropical depression on October 20. After many weeks of inactivity, a tropical depression was formed on November 12. Shortly after, the JTWC issued a TCFA for what was then-Invest 95W. At 15:00 UTC, the agency designated it as 17W. The system was expected to develop into a tropical cyclone but was hindered by easterly wind shear and dry air. On the following day, the JTWC noted that 17W had been dissipated due to the presence of high wind shear as it headed towards the equator. The last tropical cyclone of 2023 was formed east-southeast of Yap on December 13. Conditions for further development remained marginally conductive with sea surface temperatures of 30\u201331 \u00b0C (86\u201388 \u00b0F) and low vertical wind shear. The next day, it entered PAR, which gained the name Kabayan. On December 17, the system intensified into a tropical storm, and attained the name Jelawat. At 09:30 PHT (01:30 UTC) the next day, Jelawat made landfall in Manay, Davao Oriental, weakening into a tropical depression. JTWC later issued its last bulletin on Jelawat, stating that land interaction and lack of humidity had made the depression rapidly weaken. However, on December 20, JMA and JTWC monitored the remnants of the system, stating that it was marginal to regenerate. The JMA continued to observe the remnants until 18:00 UTC. The JTWC remained monitoring the remnants until they formally dissipated on December 22. Jelawat's passage through the Philippines caused heavy rainfall across Mindanao and Visayas. One person went missing while the other one got injured. Jelawat caused $43,200 thousand worth of damages throughout its onslaught."

Saola remained as a powerful super typhoon while approaching Hong Kong and China. Prior to the arrival of the typhoon, Hong Kong Observatory issued Hurricane Signal No. 10 at 20:15 HKT, September 1, the first time in 5 years since Typhoon Mangkhut (Ompong) in 2018.[156] It passed south of Macau and Hong Kong, battering gusty winds and heavy rains. Saola weakened into Category 3 before making landfall over Guangdong, China.[157] As it moves inland, Saola weakened into severe tropical storm before it dissipated on September 3."

Haikui continues to move westwards across the Philippine Sea, before finally reaching typhoon status on September 1. Haikui began undergoing rapid intensification by September 3 at least 18 hours before landfall, becoming a strong Category 3 typhoon. It then struck over Taitung County, Taiwan.[160] Due to its land interaction, it weaken back into a minimal Category 1 typhoon before moving erratically over the next few hours, heading eastwards and making a second landfall in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.[161] The JMA then downgraded Haikui back into a severe tropical storm as its circulation became degraded after the landfall. On September 5, Haikui made its final landfall along the coast of Dongshan County, Fujian before it dissipated on September 6.[162] On September 7, the remnants of Typhoon Haikui brought record breaking rainfall to Hong Kong. Hong Kong Observatory recorded 158 millimeters of rain between 11pm and midnight local time, the highest hourly rainfall rate since records began in 1884.[163] Some parts of the city even accumulated over 900\u00a0mm of rainfall within just 24 hours.[164] Four people were killed in Hong Kong as a result of the flash floods.[165] Other parts of the Pearl River Delta, including Shenzhen and Macau, were also severely impacted."

Koinu weakened to Category 2 strength yet reintensified and reached Category 4 whilst nearing Taiwan and moving west-northwestward. Koinu passed dangerously close to Lanyu before making its first landfall on mainland Hengchun, Taiwan, later weakening into a Category 3 storm as it did soon. Koinu then weakened into a Category 1 and later exited the PAR into the South China Sea.

Cindy formed east of the island and became the annual hurricane season's third named storm on August\u00a014. Due to unfavorable atmospheric conditions, Cindy remained disorganized throughout its journey across the northeastern Caribbean Sea. After attaining maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), the storm began to weaken from an interaction with the high terrain of Hispaniola. It made landfall in the Dominican Republic as a tropical depression on August\u00a016, and dissipated over the territory the following day. Despite its poor cloud structure, Cindy dropped torrential rain over portions of the northeastern Caribbean. The island of Martinique received a record 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of rain over a 24-hour period, causing severe river flooding throughout northern villages and communes. Le Pr\u00eacheur was particularly devastated by an extensive debris flow, which dragged away entire structures. The storm wrought $19\u00a0million (1993\u00a0USD) in damage across Martinique, and left two people dead and hundreds homeless on the island. En route to Hispaniola, Cindy affected the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with rough surf and moderate rain. Heavy downpours and flooding killed two people in the Dominican Republic, though the exact extent of the damage there is unknown."

        "content": "The origins of Tropical Storm Cindy can be traced to a tropical wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August\u00a08, 1993. Over the following days, the wave tracked steadily west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic while retaining a distinct cloud pattern on satellite images. Although data from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on August\u00a013 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation, a second mission at 12:00\u00a0UTC the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at the lower levels of the atmosphere. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a tropical depression\u2014a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h)\u2014and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter.[1][2] Steered by a mid- to low-level wind flow, the depression continued west-northwest toward Martinique,[1] decelerating in reaction to the island's northern mountain range.[3] Satellite images on the afternoon of August\u00a014 showed the development of a central dense overcast, as greater atmospheric turbulence over the rugged terrain amplified the cyclone's convection;[1][3] the next reconnaissance flight revealed that wind speeds near the center had increased to gale force. Based on these observations, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Cindy around 18:00\u00a0UTC, at which time the cyclone was located over Martinique with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km). Although Cindy briefly developed a favorable outflow, its upper-level structure debilitated after it moved away from the Lesser Antilles, impeding further development.[1] Over the course of August\u00a015, Cindy's cloud pattern remained disorganized due to unfavorable wind shear; the center of circulation became ill-defined, with the strongest thunderstorms confined to the eastern portion of the cyclone.[4][5] Despite the unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to strengthen marginally on August\u00a016, attaining peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1007\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.74\u00a0inHg), roughly 85\u00a0mi (137\u00a0km) southeast of Santo Domingo.[1] Shortly after peaking in strength, Cindy began to interact with the mountains of Hispaniola. The high terrain disrupted its circulation, causing it to weaken to a tropical depression at 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016. The depression made landfall near Barahona, Dominican Republic, with winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h). It became increasingly diffuse over land, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone on August\u00a017. The remnants proceeded inland near the border with Haiti and emerged into the Atlantic, where they spread across the Bahamas before dissipating the next day.[1][6]"

The highest 1- and 24-hour rainfall rates were observed in Le Pr\u00eacheur, totaling 5.79 and 12.0\u00a0in (147 and 305\u00a0mm), respectively.[26][27] These amounts were well above the September average of 9.29\u00a0in (236\u00a0mm), making Cindy one of the most extreme rain events in the island's history.[26][28] A maximum gust of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) was recorded during the storm, though sustained winds onshore did not reach tropical storm force.[22] Initially, Cindy's brisk winds downed banana trees and power lines across northern Martinique.[29] After hours of continued rain, several rivers\u2014such as the Rivi\u00e8re des P\u00e8res, Rivi\u00e8re Claire and Rivi\u00e8re S\u00e8che\u2014quickly swelled and overflowed.[30] Severe flooding and mudslides swept through northern villages, submerging homes and destroying roads and bridges.[29][31][32] News footage on national television showed \"cars [being] swept away to sea and buried in mud\".[11] The Pr\u00eacheur River, which normally flows at 18\u00a0ft3/s (0.5\u00a0m3/s), burst its banks upon attaining an exceptional discharge rate of nearly 25,000\u00a0ft3/s (700\u00a0m3/s). Large amounts of volcanic matter from the riverbed congealed into a massive debris flow, which struck the small commune of Le Pr\u00eacheur.[33][34] Reaching heights up to 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m), the sediment engulfed houses and roads, wreaking an estimated \u20a315\u00a0million (1993 value; $2.7\u00a0million in 1993 USD) in structural damage.[34] Flash floods surged through the village of Grand'Rivi\u00e8re following the overflow of its river, devastating property and drowning one person.[29][35] Despite recent improvements to its flood defenses, the Rivi\u00e8re Roxelane rapidly topped its banks and inundated much of Saint-Pierre.[36] Farther south, a combination of torrential rainfall and poor storm drains resulted in flood damage to private property and an aquafarm in Le Morne-Vert.[37] In all, Cindy killed 2 people, injured 11, and destroyed more than 150\u00a0homes across Martinique.[11][32] Monetary losses reached \u20a3107\u00a0million ($19\u00a0million), with road damage comprising \u20a368\u00a0million ($12\u00a0million).[3] After the storm's passage, thousands of people on the island sought refuge in emergency shelters, and about 3,000 residents became homeless.[11][29] La Capricieuse, a French Navy ship stationed in French Guiana, delivered disaster relief supplies to Fort-de-France; the goods included 250 packages with clothing items, distributed by the Lions Club Association of Saint Barth\u00e9lemy.[38] Unseasonable sea conditions in Cindy's wake hindered local fishers from selling their catch to trading vessels in Petite Martinique.[39] Due to the severity of the flooding in Martinique, waterways and harbors were dredged, and river banks and dykes were reinforced to prevent recurrence.[40]"

        "content": "On 5 April 2017, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began monitoring a developing tropical low located in the northeast Indian Ocean, approximately 710\u00a0km (440\u00a0mi) east of Christmas Island.[1] The system had been tracking in a generally westwards direction during the previous few days as a weak area of low pressure, but had not been significant enough to warrant the issuance of tropical cyclone warnings.[2] The tropical low tracked south-westwards throughout the day of 5 April, before adopting a course to the south-southwest during the night.[1] On the morning of 6 April, sustained gale-force winds developed on the western side of the system.[1][4] Despite the existence of these cyclone-strength winds,[5][6] the Bureau of Meteorology still classified the storm as a tropical low because they did not extend more than halfway around the system.[7] The storm continued its trend of steady intensification, and was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale by 12:00\u00a0UTC on 6 April.[1] The storm was assigned the name Ernie \u2013 the seventh tropical cyclone and sixth named storm of the 2016-17 Australian region cyclone season.[8] This intensification to Category\u00a01 status marked the beginning of a period of explosive intensification lasting about 24\u201330\u00a0hours, which concluded with Ernie being upgraded to a Category\u00a05 severe tropical cyclone at about 12:00\u00a0UTC on 7 April.[1] Upon strengthening to Category\u00a05 intensity, the cyclone had 10-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph), gusting to 285\u00a0km/h (177\u00a0mph).[9] Aided by favourable environmental conditions, including sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F), the cyclone maintained its Category\u00a05 intensity for more than 12\u00a0hours, while still tracking to the south-southwest.[1][9] Ernie continued to intensify gradually during this time, peaking with 10-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), gusts to 315\u00a0km/h (196\u00a0mph), and a central pressure of 922\u00a0hPa (27.23\u00a0inHg).[1] Its maximum one-minute sustained wind speed of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) at this time made the storm the equivalent of a lower-end Category\u00a05 major hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).[2][3] Soon afterwards, the system turned to the west-southwest and encountered an unfavorable environment of increased wind shear, dryer air, and cooler sea surface temperatures,[1][4] which caused Ernie to weaken. The storm was downgraded to Category\u00a03 status by 12:00\u00a0UTC on 8 April, about one day after it reached Category\u00a05 intensity.[1] Ernie's decline in strength was paused, though, when the system began to re-intensify a few hours later, on the morning of 9 April, local time. The renewed period of strengthening proved short-lived and meager, however, as Ernie began weakening again on the afternoon of the same day, before it could reattain Category\u00a04 status.[1] The cyclone was downgraded below severe tropical cyclone status to Category\u00a02 intensity by 12:00\u00a0UTC on 9 April, and then further to Category\u00a01 intensity by 00:00\u00a0UTC on the following day.[1] Ernie weakened below tropical cyclone intensity by 06:00\u00a0UTC on 10 April, ending its short but significant 90-hour existence as a cyclone.[1] Gales persisted in the southern quadrants of the system for a number of hours despite its declassification, due to the steep pressure gradient caused by a high pressure ridge to the south.[1] Ex-Tropical Cyclone Ernie continued to track to the west-southwest, and later in a more southerly direction until the remnants of the system dissipated four days later.[citation needed]"

        "content": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Ernie was a particularly noteworthy cyclone due to its extremely rapid rate of intensification. On the morning of 6 April, when gale-force winds were present on the western side of the developing tropical low, the storm was predicted to remain relatively weak, and reach only a marginal Category\u00a02 intensity by the early hours of 8 April local time.[4][10] After that time, it was forecast to weaken gradually while tracking to the west-southwest. As time progressed, the system attained Category\u00a02 intensity while located 720\u00a0km (450\u00a0mi) southeast of Christmas Island, and Ernie's maximum predicted strength was raised to Category\u00a03.[4] Soon, in defiance of even this raised intensity forecast, environmental conditions became near perfect for Ernie to intensify extremely rapidly, and to a high degree. The storm intensified to a Category\u00a04 severe tropical cyclone by 06:00\u00a0UTC on 7 April, then reached Category\u00a05 status at about 12:00\u00a0UTC.[1][4] From this point on, the cyclone continued to strengthen further, however at a much less frenetic pace.[1][9] Overall, Severe Tropical Cyclone Ernie intensified from a tropical low to a Category\u00a05 severe tropical cyclone in just 24\u201330\u00a0hours. The Bureau of Meteorology labelled this period of explosive intensification as \u2018extraordinary\u2019 in the cyclone's severe weather report.[1]"

        "content": "Hurricane Humberto was a large and powerful tropical cyclone that caused extensive wind damage in Bermuda during September\u00a02019. It was the eighth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane \u2013 Category 3 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale \u2013 of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. Humberto formed on September\u00a013 from the prolonged interaction of a tropical wave and an upper-level trough, then paralleled the eastern coastline of Florida through September\u00a016 before turning sharply northeastward. A generally favorable environment allowed Humberto to become a hurricane that day, and the storm further strengthened to reach peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on September\u00a018. After its center passed within 65 miles (105\u00a0km) of Bermuda around 00:00 UTC on September 19, the system encountered stronger wind shear and drier air. Stripped of its deep thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned to a potent extratropical cyclone early on September\u00a020. Forming on the heels of Hurricane Dorian two weeks prior, Humberto proved far less destructive throughout the Bahamas, producing only some squally weather. The eastern coastline of Florida saw tropical storm-force wind gusts, choppy seas, and light rainfall. Rip currents caused one death in Florida and another in North Carolina. In Bermuda, coastal flooding and rainfall were limited by low astronomical tides and Humberto's quick forward motion. However, peak surface winds of around 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), with higher gusts, caused widespread damage to trees, roofs, crops, and power lines, most notably on the western end of the island chain. Some 90% of Bermuda's banana crop was lost. As many as 600 buildings suffered roof damage, while 27,900 customers were left without power; though most of the network was quickly repaired, some electric outages persisted for at least 10 days. L.F. Wade International Airport and the Bermuda Weather Service campus both suffered property damage. In total, the hurricane wrought over $25\u00a0million in damage throughout Bermuda. Hurricane Jerry to the south briefly posed a threat to the territory as cleanup from Humberto got underway, but it ultimately dissipated with no ill-effects."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Humberto trace back to a tropical wave that exited the western coast of Africa on August\u00a027, 2019. Accompanied by little convective activity, the disturbance moved westward across the Atlantic for several days. On September\u00a04, the wave encountered a mid- to upper-level trough of low pressure several hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Resistance from the trough split the wave in two; the southern portion proceeded through the Windward Islands, while the northern portion of the wave moved toward the northwest in tandem with the trough. As the trough became negatively tilted, or oriented northwest-to-southeast, strengthening anticyclonic flow on its east side promoted periods of enhanced convection close to the tropical wave. These convective bursts, largely driven by diurnal cycles, led to the development of a broad surface low on the morning of September\u00a012 as the disturbance turned north-northwest through the Turks and Caicos Islands.[1] At 21:00\u00a0UTC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the disturbance to a potential tropical cyclone, given that it posed a threat to land but its circulation did not yet meet the organization necessary to designate a tropical cyclone. This facilitated the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Bahamas.[2] Observations from ships and nearby islands early on September\u00a013 indicated that the low-level center had become better defined, and satellite imagery depicted the formation of a narrow curved spiral band in the disturbance's northeastern quadrant. Based on this evidence, the NHC estimated that a tropical depression formed around 18:00\u00a0UTC on September 13, approximately 85 miles (137\u00a0km) east of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. It intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto six hours later.[1] The newly formed storm slowly turned northwestward as it tracked toward a weakness in the Azores High.[1] Dry air and wind shear imparted by the trough that contributed to Humberto's genesis now inhibited organization, and the tropical storm more closely resembled a subtropical cyclone rather than a fully tropical one during September\u00a014.[3] As the day progressed, reconnaissance missions found a more aligned storm center, an indication that upper-level winds were beginning to relent. Banding features flourished, upper-level outflow expanded, and a formative inner core became apparent.[4] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, Humberto intensified into the season's third hurricane as it temporarily stalled about 175 miles (282\u00a0km) east-northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. From that point, a broad upper-level trough over the East Coast of the United States steered the cyclone sharply toward the northeast.[1] While moving over sea surface temperatures of around 84\u00b0F (29\u00b0C),[5] Humberto intensified during the next day.[1] The hurricane developed a large eye, 35\u201340 miles (56\u201364\u00a0km) in diameter, surrounded by very cold cloud tops, a hallmark of intense thunderstorm activity. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on the evening of September\u00a017 was used as the basis for upgrading Humberto to a Category\u00a03 hurricane around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018.[1][6] This upgrade was applied despite a broad and asymmetric wind field that was most expansive in the southern semicircle.[7] As Humberto passed about 65 miles (105\u00a0km) northwest of Bermuda around 00:00 UTC on September 19, it reached maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h). Some satellite intensity estimates supported Category\u00a04 status, and a dropsonde in the southern eyewall measured winds aloft of 159\u00a0mph (256\u00a0km/h), in addition to surface winds of 131\u00a0mph (211\u00a0km/h). However, these values were recorded at two-second intervals and, consequently, were not representative of sustained winds. Additionally, weather radar imagery from Bermuda indicated a quickly eroding eyewall. Therefore, the strongest winds were likely the result of extratropical processes producing a wind maximum akin to a sting jet, which would not be indicative of Humberto's true strength as a tropical cyclone.[1] As Humberto accelerated ahead of the encroaching upper-level trough to its west, it encountered even stronger upper-level winds and drier air that together triggered a weakening trend. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, the system had become devoid of organized deep convection, marking its transition to an extratropical cyclone while located 575 miles (925\u00a0km) south-southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The post-tropical cyclone continued to produce a large area of gale-force winds until it merged with an even larger extratropical low around 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020.[1]"

After an expansion northward to include more of the Florida coastline, the watch was canceled early the next day.[1] A tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda at 21:00 UTC on September\u00a016 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning 24 hours later. All tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued by 06:00 UTC on September\u00a019, after the storm's departure.[1] Changes in the hurricane's structure as it approached the territory posed some forecasting challenges, especially concerning the arrival time and magnitude of damaging winds.[9] Ahead of the storm, eight cruise ships were diverted away from Bermuda.[10][11] As early as September\u00a016, L.F. Wade International Airport officials requested that vehicles be moved out of the flood-prone long-term parking area.[12] As conditions deteriorated, the airport closed at 19:00\u00a0UTC on September 18,[9] resulting in the cancellation of twelve commercial flights.[11] Aircraft were also evacuated from the airport during the closure.[13] \"The Causeway\", a route connecting the airport to the territory's population centers, was closed as a precautionary measure shortly after a public curfew took effect at 21:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018.[10][13] Ferry services were suspended at the same time, while buses stopped running in the late afternoon.[14] The government opened its only official hurricane shelter in the Cedarbridge Academy. It was staffed by 30 people from various agencies and provided accommodation for up to 100 residents. Individuals who lived on boats or who felt unsafe in their homes were encouraged to take advantage of the facility. Ultimately, nearly 50 people sought refuge there.[15][13] In an effort to communicate storm dangers to the public, Bermuda's government held a public press conference, activated the Emergency Measures Organisation's emergency broadcast radio station, and sent updates to users of a new official mobile app called Tree Frog,[9][14] introduced just months prior.[16] Governor John Rankin placed 120 members of the Royal Bermuda Regiment on standby,[15] and ambulances and Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) crews were pre-positioned in strategic locations across the island.[15] Schools, businesses, and governmental offices were closed at 16:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018.[14][15] The Bermuda Stock Exchange was also closed on September\u00a018 and 19.[17] Many boat owners removed their vessels from marinas to secure them on land.[18]"

Conditions were particularly treacherous in northeastern Florida, where strong onshore winds and resulting choppy seas made ocean rescues difficult.[21] In St. Johns County, 21 bathers were rescued from rough seas on September\u00a014 and 15.[1] One rip current victim in the county was found dead after a two-day search, while another was hospitalized in critical condition.[21][22] In Duval County, wind gusts on the periphery of Humberto reached 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[23] Florida's eastern coastline also experienced a minor 1 to 1.5\u00a0ft (0.30 to 0.46\u00a0m) storm surge and light rainfall.[1] Farther north, in Topsail Beach, North Carolina, a 62-year-old man drowned after wading into shallow water and getting caught in a rip current.[24] As the storm grew in strength and size, powerful swells propagated southward to the northern coast of Puerto Rico. In addition to coastal flooding, extensive beach erosion damaged some waterfront structures in Espinar, Agunda.[25]"

        "content": "Powerful westerly winds were the most severe aspect of the hurricane in Bermuda.[1] The highest wind speeds occurred during a relatively brief period between 23:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018 and 02:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019, coinciding with the closest approach of Humberto's center.[10] At the height of the storm, rapid fluctuations in air pressure and temperature were observed concurrently with highly turbulent wind patterns.[9] Though unconfirmed, localized tornadic activity in Humberto's right-front quadrant may have been responsible for instances of isolated damage hours before hurricane-force winds spread across the islands.[9] The quick-moving system was accompanied by only 1.57\u00a0in (40\u00a0mm) of rain,[1] insufficient to wash away foliage-burning salt residue.[26][27] Peak storm surge values were under 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m),[1] and low astronomical tides prevented any significant coastal flooding.[28] The lowest air pressure recorded in Bermuda was 970.4\u00a0mbar (28.66\u00a0inHg), and the highest waves in the seas off the territory's northern coast were analyzed near 42\u00a0ft (13\u00a0m).[9] Analysis of observations from a buoy located 9\u00a0mi (14\u00a0km) off the northwestern coast indicated that parts of Bermuda experienced sustained winds near Category\u00a03 intensity. The instrument recorded ten-minute average winds of 94\u00a0mph (151\u00a0km/h) gusting to 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h), at an elevation of 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m). Adjusting for standard elevation and then converting to a one-minute average yields estimated maximum sustained winds of about 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).[1][9] On Pearl Island, one-minute sustained winds reached 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), punctuated by gusts as high as 123\u00a0mph (198\u00a0km/h). L.F. Wade International Airport recorded ten-minute average sustained winds of 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h) and a gust of 116\u00a0mph (187\u00a0km/h). Elevated stations registered even more powerful winds; at 290\u00a0ft (88\u00a0m) above sea level, the Maritime Operations Centre on St. George's Island measured gusts to 144\u00a0mph (232\u00a0km/h).[1] A private anemometer on the roof of the historical Commissioner's House (part of the National Museum of Bermuda) recorded an extreme wind gust of 192\u00a0mph (309\u00a0km/h), but both the National Hurricane Center and Bermuda Weather Service believe this value to have been artificially inflated by the flow of air over the building.[1][9] These intense winds caused extensive damage, particularly to trees, roofs, and power lines; the worst effects were concentrated in western areas.[1][9] An estimated 500\u2013600 buildings sustained roof damage,[29][30] among them being the Somerset Police Station and an African Methodist Episcopal Church in Sandys Parish.[9][31] This corresponds with the 600 storm-related insurance claims received by three local firms by September 24.[32] Humberto left more than 27,900 electricity customers, around 80% of the territory, without power.[1][10] Many farmers suffered significant losses of fruit and vegetable crops; in particular, 90% of the banana crop was destroyed, requiring an estimated 18 months to recover. This worsened an ongoing shortage of bananas caused by pest insect infestations in imports of the fruit.[33][34] Live plants, including poinsettias and vegetable seedlings, died in conjunction with the destruction of nursery greenhouses.[33] At the airport, security fences and a jet bridge were badly damaged. In the Royal Naval Dockyard, a shipping container blew into the water and presumably sank. A man attempting to ride out the storm on his yacht was briefly imperiled when the vessel broke free from its moorings and eventually wrecked on an island in the Great Sound.[9] Off the northern shore, the wreck of the paddle steamer Montana, a popular dive site, was heavily damaged.[35] The Bermuda Weather Service campus suffered the loss of a satellite dish, antennas, and the weather balloon launching platform, which was blown off its foundation.[9] The agency also lost communication with its Doppler weather radar system near the height of the storm.[10] No major damage was reported in the capital city of Hamilton, though some city parks were closed to the public due to unsafe conditions.[15] The Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service responded to numerous calls for minor fires and other incidents.[15] In total, Humberto caused more than $25 million in damage to Bermuda.[1] Despite the severity of the storm and breadth of damage, no deaths or serious injuries were attributed to the hurricane in the territory.[10]"

        "content": "In the wake of the hurricane, fallen or low-hanging trees and power lines left some Bermuda roads impassable, so officials advised residents to remain indoors.[36] From the early morning hours on September\u00a019, the Royal Bermuda Regiment assisted government agencies in removing debris from roads.[9] To accommodate the influx of horticultural debris, the Marsh Folly Composting Facility waived its gate fee for disposal of vegetation.[15] The Causeway was reopened to traffic around midday on September\u00a019 following assessments by structural engineers.[13] L.F. Wade International Airport reopened around the same time once repairs to the damaged fencing had been rushed to completion.[9] Government offices, businesses, and most ferry routes resumed normal operations on September\u00a020, while public schools remained closed for an additional day while building evaluations were underway. As BELCO crews repaired the electricity infrastructure, the number of power outages fell to 10,000 by the morning of September\u00a021 and to 1,000 on September\u00a026.[15] The company, which is Bermuda's only electricity supplier, received help from retired employees and mutual aid from another utility company based in the United States.[37] Restoration was temporarily slowed by several utility pole fires caused by salt corrosion.[38] A small number of outages persisted 10 days after the storm.[39] Despite swift cleanup in most locations, a few small streets and parts of the Bermuda Railway Trail remained blocked for several weeks.[9] Immediately after the hurricane, damaged structures were temporarily protected by tarps.[9] Bermuda's Department of Planning relaxed its requirements for building permits to fix certain types of storm-related damage.[40] As a consequence of an ongoing slate tile shortage caused by the inability of local quarries to meet demand, permanent roof repairs were delayed for many residents.[29] With intensifying Hurricane Jerry to the south also considered a potential threat, preparedness measures resumed almost immediately after Humberto's passage. However, Jerry degenerated into a remnant low-pressure system before reaching Bermuda, resulting in only a brief period of inclement weather.[9][41] Premier of the British Virgin Islands Andrew Fahie expressed that his government was prepared to help Bermuda cope with the effects of hurricanes Humberto and Jerry.[15][42]"

        "content": " On 6 February 2023, at 04:17\u00a0TRT (01:17\u00a0UTC), a Mw\u00a07.8 earthquake struck southern and central Turkey and northern and western Syria. The epicenter was 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi) west\u2013northwest of Gaziantep.[2] The earthquake had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XII (Extreme) around the epicenter and in Antakya. It was followed by a Mw\u202f7.7 earthquake at 13:24.[3] This earthquake was centered 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) north-northeast from the first. There was widespread damage and tens of thousands of fatalities. The Mw\u202f7.8 earthquake is the largest in Turkey since the 1939 Erzincan earthquake of the same magnitude,[4] and jointly the second-largest in the country, after larger estimates for the 1668 North Anatolia earthquake.[5] It is also one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded in the Levant. It was felt as far as Egypt and the Black Sea coast of Turkey. There were more than 30,000 aftershocks in the three months that followed.[6] The seismic sequence was the result of shallow strike-slip faulting along segments of the Dead Sea Transform, East Anatolian and S\u00fcrg\u00fc\u2013\u00c7ardak faults. There was widespread damage in an area of about 350,000\u00a0km2 (140,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), about the size of Germany.[7] An estimated 14 million people, or 16 percent of Turkey's population, were affected.[8] Development experts from the United Nations estimated that about 1.5 million people were left homeless.[9] The confirmed death toll in Turkey was 53,537; estimates of the number of dead in Syria were between 5,951 and 8,476. It is the deadliest earthquake in what is now present-day Turkey since the 526 Antioch earthquake[10] and the deadliest natural disaster in its modern history.[11] It is also the deadliest in present-day Syria since the 1822 Aleppo earthquake;[12] the deadliest worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake;[13] and the fifth-deadliest of the 21st century.[14] Damages were estimated at US$148.8\u00a0billion in Turkey, or nine-percent of the country's GDP, and US$14.8\u00a0billion in Syria.[15][16] Damaged roads, winter storms, and disruption to communications hampered the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency's rescue and relief effort, which included a 60,000-strong search-and-rescue force,[17] 5,000 health workers[18] and 30,000 volunteers.[19] Following Turkey's call for international help, more than 141,000 people from 94 countries joined the rescue effort.[20]"

        "content": "Central southern Turkey and northwestern Syria are affected by the interaction between three tectonic plates; the African Plate, Arabian Plate and Anatolian Plate. The boundary between the African and Arabian plates is represented by the Dead Sea Transform (DST)\u2014a major zone of left-lateral strike-slip fault\u2014it accommodates the relative northward movement of Arabia with respect to Africa. The northern end of the DST truncates at the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) another major left-lateral strike-slip fault zone that accommodates the overall westward movement of the Anatolian Plate as it is extruded in that direction by the northward movement of the Arabian Plate. The DST and EAF meet at the Marash Triple Junction. The EAF continues west of the triple junction, forming the boundary between the African and Anatolian plates, linking into the Cyprus arc to the west via the Latakia Ridge.[21] The 700\u00a0km-long (430\u00a0mi) EAF is subdivided into seven segments, from the northeast; the Karl\u0131ova, Il\u0131ca, Palu, P\u00fct\u00fcrge, Erkenek, Pazarc\u0131k and Amanos segments.[21] The Amanos segment is also considered part of the DST by some geologists,[22] or a transitional structure between the EAF and DST by others.[23] A northern strand to the EAF has also been recognized, including the S\u00fcrg\u00fc, \u00c7ardak, Savrun, \u00c7okak, Toprakkale, Yumurtal\u0131k, Karata\u015f, Yakap\u0131nar and D\u00fczi\u00e7i\u2013\u0130skenderun segments. The estimated slip rate on the main strand of the EAF system decreases south-westwards from 10\u00a0mm (0.39\u00a0in) per year on the Karl\u0131ova segment down to 2.9\u00a0mm (0.11\u00a0in) per year on the Amanos segment. On the northern strand, a slip rate of 2.5\u00a0mm (0.098\u00a0in) per year was estimated on the \u00c7ardak segment.[21] The S\u00fcrg\u00fc-\u00c7ardak Fault is an east\u2013west striking 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) long fault that runs north of the EAF. It branches away from the EAF west of \u00c7elikhan and extends westwards to G\u00f6ksun.[24] Comprising two segments; the S\u00fcrg\u00fc Fault runs 70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) between \u00c7elikhan and Nurhak; the \u00c7ardak Fault runs 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) between Nurhak and G\u00f6ksun.[25] Seismicity on the fault is low\u2014the only associated earthquake was a M 6.8 event in 1544.[26] The northern part of the DST is subdivided into several segments, although there is some disagreement between scientists as to which faults should be assigned to the DST and which to the EAF, at the northernmost end of the structure. Following the 2013 \"Active Fault Map of Turkey\", seven DST segments are recognized in Turkey and neighbouring parts of Syria; the Afrin, Sermada, Armanaz, Hac\u0131pa\u015fa, Yesemek, Sak\u00e7ag\u00f6z and Narl\u0131 segments.[21]"

The Pazarc\u0131k and Amanos segments in the west have recurrence intervals of 237\u2013772 years and 414\u2013917 years, respectively, for M 7.0\u20137.4 earthquakes.[28] A research paper published by Earth and Planetary Science Letters in 2002 studied stress accumulation and increased seismic hazard along the East Anatolian Fault. The study concluded two sections of the fault with a considerably high potential for future earthquakes. One of these sections was in Elaz\u0131\u011f and Bing\u00f6l, located between the rupture zones of the 1874 and 1971 earthquakes. The seismic gap ruptured during a Mw\u202f 6.1 earthquake in 2010. The 2020 Mw\u202f 6.8 earthquake ruptured to the southwest between the 1893/1905 and 1874 earthquakes.[32] Another seismic gap was located in Kahramanmara\u015f\u2014this 103\u00a0km (64\u00a0mi) long section\u2014according to the study, believed to last rupture in 1513 has the potential to produce magnitude 7.3 earthquakes.[33] Large earthquakes on the northern part of the DST include events in 115, 526, 587, 1138, 1170 and 1822, which resulted in several tens of thousands to several hundreds of thousands of fatalities.[2][34]"

The earthquake hypocenter was at a depth of 10.0\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) according to USGS and 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) according to KOERI.[2][37][38] The shock had a focal mechanism corresponding to strike-slip faulting.[2][36] It is one of the strongest ever recorded in Turkey, equivalent in magnitude to the 1939 Erzincan earthquake (Mw\u202f7.8).[39][4] These earthquakes are surpassed only by the larger estimates for the 1668 North Anatolia earthquake.[40][41] Globally it was the strongest recorded since August 2021.[42] Both earthquakes are the largest and only observed to occur on land within a short span of time.[43] At 10:24 UTC, an earthquake measuring Mww\u202f7.5 according to USGS,[44] Mw\u202f7.6[45] according to KOERI, or Mw\u202f7.7 according to Geoscope[46] and the GCMT,[3] struck with an epicenter near Ekin\u00f6z\u00fc, 95\u00a0km northeast of the M7.8 event. It had a depth of 7.4\u00a0km (5\u00a0mi) according to the USGS, 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) by KOERI,[47] and 13\u00a0km (8\u00a0mi) by Geoscope. The shock was also the result of strike-slip faulting; it had an epicenter north of the previous large earthquake.[46] A reevaluation of the earthquakes using long-period coda moment magnitude obtained Mw\u202f 7.95 \u00b1 0.013 and Mw\u202f 7.86 \u00b1 0.012, respectively.[48] These earthquakes were some of the largest Turkish earthquakes in over 2,000 years.[49]"

Another zone of large slip estimated at 4.96\u00a0m (16.3\u00a0ft) occurred further northeast along Segment 2, northwest of Ad\u0131yaman.[2] The USGS source model for the Mw\u202f7.7 earthquake which struck nine hours later has three large fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) \u00d7 >20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi), 276\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 1), >40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) \u00d7 >20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi), 250\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 2) and ~80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) \u00d7 >20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi), 060\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 3). Maximum displacement occurred on Segment 1 at 11.4\u00a0m (37\u00a0ft).[44] Three segments of the EAF were involved in the Mw\u202f 7.8 rupture; the Amanos, Pazarc\u0131k and Erkenek segments. The earthquake ruptured ~370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) of the EAF, producing a maximum slip of up to ~12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) along the Pazarc\u0131k segment.[57][58] The northern end of the rupture was about 20\u201330\u00a0km (12\u201319\u00a0mi) south of the Mw\u202f 6.8 earthquake that struck in 2020. This section of the EAF, the P\u00fct\u00fcrge segment, between both earthquakes, may represent a seismic gap. The southern segment of the EAF rupture was at its termination, near Antakya. Slip peaked at 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) from the surface to 7\u00a0km (4.3\u00a0mi) depth during the Mw\u202f 7.7 earthquake; slip was 11\u00a0m (36\u00a0ft) at the surface. Slip along the fault was compact\u2014mostly confined to within the \u00c7ardak Fault; it was also shallower\u2014attenuating from 8\u201312\u00a0km (5.0\u20137.5\u00a0mi). Slip during the Mw\u202f 7.8 event extended to 18\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) and 12\u00a0km (7.5\u00a0mi) for the Mw\u202f 7.7 event. The Mw\u202f 6.4 aftershock that struck Antakya on 20 February had a rupture area of 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) \u00d7 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) and produced a peak slip of 0.93\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in) at 8.3\u00a0km (5.2\u00a0mi) depth.[59] Preliminary analysis of the effects of stress changes caused by the M7.8 earthquake on the \u00c7ardak\u2013S\u00fcrg\u00fc Fault, based on the USGS fault model, indicated up to 3 bars of added stress near the epicenter of the M7.7 shock, sufficient to trigger rupture on that zone, assuming that it was already close to failure.[60][61] Stress on the Hatay Fault, source of the 20 February Mw\u202f 6.4 aftershock, increased by 1 bar following the 6 February earthquakes.[26]"

Ruptures then continued bilaterally to the northeast and southwest along this segment. This subevent on the Narl\u0131 Fault corresponded to a Mw\u202f 7.0 earthquake which ruptured for 20 seconds. It had a focal mechanism corresponding to oblique-normal faulting.[26] A preliminary analysis of near-field (within 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) of the fault rupture) seismic records indicates that the initial rupture speed transitioned to supershear after propagating about 19.5\u00a0km (12.1\u00a0mi) away from the epicenter along the Narl\u0131 Fault before it reached the EAF.[64] Back projection suggests the total rupture length was ~560\u00a0km (350\u00a0mi).[65] The rupture continued northeast onto the Ekernek segment and to the southwest onto the Amanos segment.[66] The northeastern rupture ceased 55 seconds after initiation while the southwestern rupture ceased near Antakya about 80 seconds later.[43] A Mw\u202f6.8 aftershock occurring 11 minutes later and west of the first M>7 epicenter may have ruptured along the Sak\u00e7ag\u00f6z Fault, the next segment of the DST to the south.[66] Rupture along the EAF during the event occurred at subshear velocity (maximum 3.2\u00a0km (2.0\u00a0mi) per second).[67] An analysis of near-field seismic data revealed transient supershear rupture episodes throughout the EAF rupture. Supershear rupture occurred along the northernmost section of the Narl\u0131 Fault where it meets the EAF. The rupture transitioned onto the EAF and propagated northeast at supershear velocity until its termination near Malatya. Rupture towards the southwest was mostly subshear, but at the southern termination in Hatay, where the fault has multiple branches and kinks, supershear was likely observed. Supershear rupture at the southern termination contributed to the intense ground motion in Antakya.[68] The second M>7 earthquake initiated on a separate fault[69][70] known as the \u00c7ardak\u2013S\u00fcrg\u00fc Fault Zone,[71] part of the northern strand of the East Anatolian Fault.[21][72][73][74] The rupture propagated bilaterally along the \u00c7ardak segment, continuing eastwards onto the S\u00fcrg\u00fc segment before continuing eastwards to Malatya along the northeast\u2013southwest trending Do\u011fan\u015fehir Fault Zone. Rupture also propagated towards the southwest along the \u00c7ardak segment. The total rupture length was estimated at 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi).[66] The westward-propagating rupture occurred at supershear velocity (maximum 4.8\u00a0km (3.0\u00a0mi) per second) while the eastward-propagating rupture occurred at subshear velocity (maximum 2.8\u00a0km (1.7\u00a0mi) per second).[67] The rupture lasted about 35 seconds.[43] The Mw\u202f 6.4 aftershock on 20 February occurred along the Hatay Fault. The focal mechanism indicated normal faulting along a northeast\u2013southwest striking fault.[26]"

        "content": "The extent of surface ruptures associated with the M7.8 and M7.7 earthquakes have been mapped using a mixture of satellite imagery and ground observations. Pixel matching on images captured by Sentinel-1 before and after the earthquakes showed sharp discontinuities in displacement, revealing two separate zones of surface rupture. The longer of the pair, produced by the first earthquake, measured 320\u00a0km (200\u00a0mi) while the second earthquake produced 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) of surface rupture.[43][75] These observations were backed up with direct imaging of the ruptures using other satellite data, such as from the DigitalGlobe's WorldView-1, 2 & 3 and GeoEye-1,[76] and by field work.[77][71] Remote sensing using satellite imagery indicated 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) of surface rupture with large normal faulting component. The zone of surface rupture extended from north of Antakya, Hatay Province towards Pazarc\u0131k, Kahramanmara\u015f Province and G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131, Ad\u0131yaman Province.[74] Surface ruptures continued north of these cities. Surface rupture occurred in the Amik Valley. The westernmost part of Hatay Airport was damaged by surface ruptures but cracks in the runway were attributed to ground deformation. A major canal was damaged and lead to flooding in parts of the Amik Valley which was formerly Lake Amik.[78] Field observations indicate a maximum displacement of 7.3\u00a0m (24\u00a0ft) on the surface.[79] Geologists traced a 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) surface rupture trending south from Pazarc\u0131k with an offset of 2.5\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in). From Golbasi to Nurda\u011f\u0131 ground displacements were up to 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft).[71] The surface rupture observed during the M7.8 earthquake was unusually large, comparable to that during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake along the San Andreas Fault.[80] Large surface offsets of 6\u20138\u00a0m (20\u201326\u00a0ft) were observed along the S\u00fcrg\u00fc-\u00c7ardak Fault. Along a road west of G\u00f6zp\u0131nar\u00a0[ce; tr; tt; vi], the rupture displaced the road left-laterally for 8.6\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft).[81] The largest maximum surface offset was 10.0\u201312.6\u00a0m (32.8\u201341.3\u00a0ft); one of the largest surface offset ever observed from an earthquake.[82]"

The town of Hassa recorded 0.9082 g in ground acceleration (pga) and 215.34\u00a0cm/s (84.78\u00a0in/s) in ground velocity. The station data corresponded to a Modified Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). A peak ground acceleration of 1.62 g was recorded by a station at Fevzipa\u015fa.[84] The peak ground acceleration generally exceeded 0.5 g in a large area around the epicenter, near Adiyaman and a large part of Hatay. High pga values of 2 g were recorded in Hatay.[43] The maximum recorded pga was 2.212 g at a station in Pazarc\u0131k Belediyesi Park\u0131, Pazarc\u0131k; a government health facility nearby had limited damage but the surrounding town was devastated.[85] The maximum recorded pga during the Mw\u202f 7.7 earthquake was 0.59 g at G\u00f6ksun.[86] According to Kandilli Observatory, the maximum Mercalli intensity (MMI) of the mainshock was estimated to have reached MMI XI\u2013XII (Extreme) in Antakya and near the epicenter. MMI XI (Extreme) or higher was observed along the fault rupture from the epicenter to Antakya.[87] The MMI also reached IX\u2013X (Violent\u2013Extreme) in Kahramanmara\u015f and \u0130skenderun, VIII\u2013IX (Severe\u2013Violent) in Malatya and Ad\u0131yaman, VII\u2013VIII (Very strong\u2013Severe) in Gaziantep, Kilis, Idlib and Aleppo, and VI\u2013VII (Strong\u2013Very strong) in Adana and \u015eanl\u0131urfa.[88] The maximum MMI of the second earthquake was X (Extreme).[89]"

        "content": "Liquefaction was identified via satellite and remote sensing along the southern portion of the Mw\u202f7.8 rupture on the East Anatolian Fault from Antakya to Golbasi. Liquefaction and lateral spreading were observed at and near coastal areas, fluvial valleys and drained lake or swamp areas, covered by Holocene sediments.[90] These effects were widespread in the Amik Valley and Orontes River plain, north of Antakya, Hatay Province. Limited observations were made in high-elevation areas due to snow cover and lack of satellite observations.[90] Liquefaction was also observed in Samanda\u011f. At Lake G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131, Ad\u0131yaman Province, lateral spreading occurred along the northern, eastern and southern coast. Parts of the lakeshore were also submerged. G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131 was also damaged by liquefaction and lateral spreading.[78] Subsidence due to lateral spreading caused extensive damage in \u0130skenderun. Liquefaction produced sand ejecta that buried Atat\u00fcrk Boulevard in \u00c7ay District. Regular flooding in the city was observed after the earthquakes. Earlier flooding may be attributed to liquefaction while subsequent occurrences may be due to damage to the coast and water infrastructure.[91] The sea inundated parts of the city by as much as 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft). Large areas of the coast and sections of piers were flooded due to lateral spreading. Large waves from bad weather and a tsunami may have contributed to the effects observed at \u0130skenderun.[92] Both earthquakes caused shaking levels (\u22650.12\u202fg) sufficient for landslide-triggering across a 90,000\u00a0km2 (35,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) area. About 3,673 earthquake-triggered landslides were identified using satellite imagery, aerial photos, and one field survey of the area. Landslides mainly occurred in the northern region of the affected area. Rockslides were the most commonly observed; there were also many bedrock rotational landslides, translational slides and lateral spreads. Surface ruptures propagating through hillsides also triggered landslides. These landslides blocked roads and river channels, destroyed or seriously damaged buildings and caused many deaths.[93] One of the largest landslides occurred near Tepehan village, Hatay Province; a translational slide which detached a block 1.3\u00a0km2 (0.50\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). This landslide occurred in a region comprising marl and clay-rich limestone. It produced a 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) vertical displacement along its scarp.[93] ITV News reported the landslide scarp was up to 1,000\u00a0ft (300\u00a0m) long and \"wider than a football pitch\" in some areas.[94]"

The largest wave measured 40\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Although no underwater surveys results have been made available to identify the sources of these tsunamis, they were likely produced by landsliding at Iskenderun Port and liquefaction on the coastal flatlands of Antakya.[95] Small tsunami waves were recorded off the coast of Famagusta, Cyprus, without damage.[96] The tsunami measured 0.17\u00a0m (6.7\u00a0in), and tsunami waves were recorded at 0.12\u00a0m (4.7\u00a0in) at \u0130skenderun and 0.13\u00a0m (5.1\u00a0in) at Erdemli.[97] Tsunami warnings were issued for the southern Turkish coast, southern and eastern Italian coasts and the whole eastern Mediterranean Sea area, but later withdrawn.[98][99][100][101][102]"

The rupture was aressted by a stepover that connected the East Anatolian Fault with the Hac\u0131pa\u015fa Fault. Though it did not rupture, the Coulomb stress increased on the Hac\u0131pa\u015fa Fault. A combination of the increases stress, 600\u2013900 without major earthquakes, and its annual 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) slip rate, the Hac\u0131pa\u015fa Fault remains a potential source of magnitude 7.0 or greater earthquakes. The accumulated slip along this segment is estimated at 3\u20139\u00a0m (9.8\u201329.5\u00a0ft). An earthquake \"domino effect\" remains plausible along the Dead Sea Transform beginning with the Hac\u0131pa\u015fa Fault, as observed along the North Anatolian Fault, where successive earthquakes have migrated westwards along the fault since 1939.[103]"

An engineer revealed to the newspaper; \"the building violated the basic tenets of engineering,\" after inspecting its blueprints. Contractors of the building said they adhered to building regulations but those were not enough against the earthquake.[175] The 13-storey apartment block consists of three closely spaced buildings linked externally, but not structurally; when the collapse occurred, all three buildings separated. The basement, two-storey parking space was considered the \"strongest part\" of the complex as it had more concrete walls than other parts of the structure. The building's exterior walls and those that separated units and rooms consisted of heavy masonry which may have prevented the structure from swaying and possibly held the building mostly intact despite toppling. The building was considered a soft story structure as the ground floor had fewer masonry walls which meant it was at greater risk of damage from seismic ground motion. Among other factors were that the core concrete columns which housed the elevator systems were situated along the north side which left the south side vulnerable without adequate support. Another reason was that beams emerging from either side of the building were misaligned and did not connect to each other. These features may have contributed to the building overturning onto its south side.[175] In \u0130skenderun, an industrial city in Hatay Province, a large fire at the port was reported on 6 February at 17:00,[176] believed to have originated from a container carrying flammable industrial oil,[177] forcing the port's closure and the diversion of many ships. It was extinguished on 6[178] and 8[179] February, only for it to reignite the next day each time.[180][181] It was finally extinguished on 10 February.[182] A total of 3,670 containers were destroyed by the fire and the port managing authority said it would take three months for operations to resume.[183] The city saw 534 buildings collapse, 337 requiring demolition and 4,622 receiving severe damage.[159] Flooding occurred along the city shoreline, inundating streets up to 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft) inland.[184] The Cathedral of the Annunciation, seat of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Anatolia, was almost completely destroyed.[185] At least 3,109 people died in the city and over 12,000 were injured.[186] In Erzin District, 31 buildings collapsed and 897 were heavily damaged or had to be demolished.[159] However, there were no collapses or major damage in Erzin, the largest town in the district.

A rescuer in the affected area said many looters carried knives with them.[464] Looting occurred at damaged shops and buildings. Videos also circulated online allegedly showing goods stolen from aid vehicles, looting at buildings and alleged looters being beaten by officials or crowds. On 11 February, Anadolu Agency, citing unnamed sources, said Turkish officials arrested 98 people and seized stolen goods.[465] In Hatay Province, 42 people were held for stealing cash, smartphones, computers, weaponries, jewellery and bank cards. Authorities also arrested six people for cheating a survivor in Gaziantep.[463] Turkey's Human Rights Association recorded several instances of violence and torture against alleged looters in Hatay Province. In one instance, a person died while in custody of officials after he was arrested in Hatay's Altin\u00f6z\u00fc District alongside his brother. The surviving brother said he had been tortured. The siblings' father who identified the body said the victim died from a blood clot and had broken ribs and a broken nose. There were many reports of people mistaken as looters and violently beaten, including the beating of volunteer rescuers. A video which showed the lynching of three alleged refugees was posted on Twitter.[466] German and Austrian rescuers deployed to Hatay suspended operations, citing a worsening security situation due to the slow arrival of aid or sporadic clashes between armed groups.[467][468] The teams later resumed operations when the Turkish Land Forces provided protection.[469] On 12 February, rescuers from the Israeli search-and-rescue group United Hatzalah left Turkey, citing \"intelligence of a concrete and immediate threat on the Israeli delegation\".[470][471] On 9 February, three inmates were killed and 12 more injured after soldiers opened fire during a prison riot in Hatay.

On 13 February, B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7 of the AKP demanded the elections be postponed despite the constitution disallowing such a possibility in the absence of war. Ar\u0131n\u00e7's declaration has been criticized by media outlets and politicians.[475] However, the possibility of this passing through amending the constitution was uncertain, as the governing coalition, with its 333 seats in parliament, could not surpass the 400-number hurdle needed for the motion to succeed.[476] On 18 February, AKP authorities stated that the elections would not be delayed.[477] Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu of the CHP opposed its postponement on constitutional grounds. Mustafa Tolga \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, YSK member of the \u0130Y\u0130 party stated that YSK does not have any power to postpone an election and only parliament has the right to do so, adding that Turkey had no more time to lose with the AKP. Selahattin Demirta\u015f of the Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) has described the postponement as a political coup. The declaration of state of emergency in the affected regions was also interpreted as a possible measure to postpone elections.[475] Nevertheless, the earthquake led to the opposition Nation Alliance postponing its 13 February meeting for the selection of its consensus presidential candidate to 6 March,[476] which was eventually assumed by K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. At the elections on 14 May, Erdo\u011fan's People's Alliance retained its majority in the Grand National Assembly,[478] while Erdo\u011fan won in the first round of the presidential election, receiving 49.5%, and won 52.2% of the vote in the second round against K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu on 28 May.[479] This marked the first time a Turkish presidential election went into a run-off.[480] In both instances, Erdo\u011fan retained the support of a majority of voters in most of the provinces devastated by the earthquake.[481][482]"

The Ministry of Internal Trade and Consumer Protection was ordered by President al-Assad to supply food and organize teams to distribute them. Technical teams were also on site to evaluate building conditions and evacuate residents in at-risk structures. The Ministry of Water Resources was tasked with rapidly assessing damage to dams, reservoirs and water stations, and ensuring people have access to water.[505] The Syrian government appealed to UN member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations for international aid.[272] Syria also requested for aid from the European Union's European Civil Protection Mechanism, according to commissioner Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d.[391] The Syrian government, through its representative in the United Nations, said that it should be responsible for aid distribution in all areas of the country, including those held by the rebels. The UK government said it would deliver aid through its long-term partners, the White Helmets civilian defense force.[507] The US State Department said it would use its humanitarian partners on the ground.[508] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said damaged roads and logistical issues prevented the mobilization of international aid across the border from Turkey. Border crossings into Turkey remained closed on 7 February. Critically injured patients were unable to enter Turkey for medical attention. There were exceptions as to which persons could cross, including individuals holding touristic residence permits who could only cross by foot.[509] The Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing was made accessible on 8 February, according to the UN.[510] Some hotels including in Latakia and Damascus offered to accommodate to survivors free of charge and ensure basic necessities. Refugees and expatriates also opened their homes as shelters for people. Al-Sham Private University started an effort to receive people. Sports facilities, events venues, university dormitories and halls were also opened to take in people. The Syria Trust for Development announced the establishment of shelters across many governorates. Volunteer groups inspected buildings for damage and distributed food items, blankets, and first aid essentials.[511] Due to the high number of casualties, including trauma cases, many hospitals became overcrowded. Hospitals were already experiencing a shortage of medical supplies prior to the earthquake. Hospitals in many cities were forced to operate far beyond capacity. Many patients at hospitals slept on floors due to the lack of beds. The Ministry of Health dispatched medical convoys from the Health Directorates of Damascus, Rif Dimashq Governorate, Quneitra, Homs, and Tartus, to Aleppo and Latakia to rebel-held areas. Twenty-eight ambulances, seven mobile clinics, and four trucks carrying medical, surgical and emergency aid were also dispatched.[512] Local charities across the country, which typically distribute food during the month of Ramadan, have been exhausted to their fullest capacity. One of these charities, Saed Initiative, planned to establish a charity kitchen to provide free meals for the rest of the year. Between 2,500 and 4,000 meals were distributed every day in Aleppo, and the charity plans to distribute up to 40,000 meals every day. Another charity in the city, the al-Bir and al-Ihsan charity, provided 1,500 meals every day.[513] Over 2,000 Syria Civil Defense (White Helmets) volunteers were sent to all the affected areas to conduct search and rescue efforts. With a lack of equipment and tools, they appealed to other humanitarian organizations for support.[512] Officials on 7 February announced rescue and recovery efforts in Hama ended after 15 hours.[261] Over 298,000 people were left without homes and 180 shelters were opened in government-held areas.[514] About 30,000 people were housed in shelters in Aleppo.[279] As of 10 February, no international rescue workers had arrived in rebel-held Jinderis despite official calls for help.[515] United States sanctions against Syria relating to the blocking of banks and payment processors led to the banning of international charities and families attempting to send money to people affected in Syria.[516][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] On 7 February 2023, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent urged Western countries to lift sanctions against Syria, saying the measures hurt civilians and humanitarian efforts during the earthquake recovery effort.[517] The sanctions are a series of economic measures taken by the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, and the Arab League against the Assad regime from the start of the civil war in 2011. They include an oil embargo and the freezing of financial assets of the state and government officials.[518][519] There were requests to lift or suspend the sanctions to aid humanitarian efforts following the earthquake.[520][521] On 10 February, the United States announced it would exempt sanctions against Syria for 180 days. The ease of sanctions was for \"all transactions related to earthquake relief efforts\", according to the United States Department of the Treasury.[522] The Syrian Foreign Ministry responded in a statement that the US' decision was \"misleading and aims to give a false humanitarian impression\" and that \"the facts on the ground proved its falsehood.\"[523][524] Some commentators have argued that the sanctions do not pose a problem for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria.[525] International humanitarian assistance began entering northwestern Syria on 9 February via Turkey through the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. The first convoy of six trucks carried tents and sanitary items. Turkey said it was working to open two additional border crossings.[526] On 10 February 14 trucks carrying aid crossed from Turkey into Syria, according to the United Nations.[527] The United States Central Command announced it would cooperate with Syrian Democratic Forces to assist the affected population in Syria.[528] On 11 February, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited Aleppo, accompanying a shipment of emergency medical supplies.[529] On 12 February, all schools across Syria, except for those in the affected areas, were resumed since the earthquakes struck. Schools in Aleppo, Lattakia, Hama and Idleb remained closed.[530] On 14 February, the Syrian government agreed to open the border crossings at Bab al-Salameh and Al-Rai for three months.[531] President al-Assad met UN relief chief Martin Griffiths on 21 March to discuss post-earthquake recovery and aid.[532] A year later and the situation was still described as \"devastating\" by Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East & North Africa programme at the European Council. The Human Rights Watch said Syria's humanitarian and economic had deteriorated further; many damaged infrastructure have not been cleared. Furthermore, the number of people who rely on aid had increased, while funding for UN organizations had diminished. The UN deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis said the relief response following the earthquakes was the most underfunded plan in terms of percentage, with funding at 38 percent, since the crisis began in 2011.[533]"

However, professor Hasan S\u00f6zbilir, Director of Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University (DEU) Earthquake Research and Application Center, told Anadolu Agency that there were only 2 mainshocks reaching above Mw\u202f7 between 6 and 17 February 2023, but of the smaller quakes, there was one that reached Mw\u202f6.7.[560] Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.[561] The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes.[562] After the 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes.[563] The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse.[564] The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material.[564] There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.[563] After the earthquake, Erdo\u011fan had claimed \"98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999\" and described it \"as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement\".[565] Erdo\u011fan's claim was criticized by civil engineer and earthquake engineering academic Haluk Sucuo\u011flu, stating that field observations and more than half of the buildings in earthquake-affected areas being built after 2000 making Erdo\u011fan's claims unlikely, though accepting that concrete data on the destroyed buildings do not exist yet.[566] The comparison of historical satellite images with those taken after the earthquake, especially of those showing the destruction in the newly built area of western Kahramanmara\u015f, were used to dispute Erdo\u011fan's claim.[567] In Ad\u0131yaman, the minister of transport and infrastructure, Adil Karaismailo\u011flu, and governor, Mahmut \u00c7uhadar, were met with protests by locals. The state car of the governor was also kicked by protesters.[568] Turkish engineers previously warned that cities could become 'graveyards' with building amnesty.[569] Critics of President Erdo\u011fan said contractors of housing projects were allowed to skip vital safety mandates which put residents at risk. Videos from several years ago showed Erdo\u011fan applauding housing projects which eventually collapsed. During a campaign stop in anticipation of the March 2019 local elections, he listed, among his government's top attainment, new housing in Kahramanmaras. Erdo\u011fan said \"We solved the problem of 144,156 citizens of Maras with zoning amnesty,\" In another video, he said \"We have solved the problems of 205,000 citizens of Hatay with zoning peace,\"[570] Before the 2018 general election, 3.1\u00a0million buildings were granted amnesty certificates, according to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Secretary General Assistant and city planner, Bugra Gokce. In the ten affected provinces, 294,165 certificates were granted; 59,247 in Adana; 10,629 in Ad\u0131yaman; 14,719 in Diyarbak\u0131r; 40,224 in Gaziantep; 56,464 in Hatay; 39,58 in Kahramanmara\u015f; 4,897 in Kilis; 22,299 in Malatya; 21,107 in Osmaniye; and 25,521 in \u015eanl\u0131urfa.[571] After a destructive earthquake struck \u0130zmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2\u00a0billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in \u0130zmir.[572] The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdo\u011fan.[430] He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown.[573] It has also been reported that some donations from relief organizations arriving at the Adana airport were relabeled as assistance by the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) or also the governing AKP.[574] Questions also arose as to how an \"earthquake tax\" (officially \"special communications tax\") levied by the Turkish government in the wake of the 1999 earthquake, estimated to have reached 88bn lira ($4.6bn; \u00a33.8bn) and meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services, were spent, given how the government has never given a public explanation.[430] Some Kurdish and Alevi residents alleged discrimination and neglect in the government's recovery efforts.[575][576] The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) accused Turkish authorities of preventing equal distribution of aid[577] and favoring areas inhabited majorly by people loyal to the governing AKP.[578]"

According to Kaptan, numerous relief agencies were merged into AFAD in the past years and since the implementation of the referendum, AFAD became part of the Ministry of Interior, losing its autonomy and self-governance. Kaptan added that the Ministry of Interior, responsible for making decisions, hindered the fast response since the organization required approval for its actions, contrasting more independent agencies like FEMA in the United States.[580] AFAD was also criticized on the claims of inappropriate board of management, since some members of the board had no disaster management background. \u0130smail Palako\u011flu\u00a0[tr], the general manager of disaster response subdivision of AFAD and a theologian who previously worked at the Directorate of Religious Affairs, was criticized by several politicians and media outlets.[581][582][583] Another criticism was the late deployment of military resources.[579] They were not mobilized for two days after the earthquake, and even then in what many considered in very modest amounts.[584][need quotation to verify] There were many instances where aid was forced to go through local governors, who were not elected but appointed by the government. In some instances, aid was held by the ruling party with the explanation that it would be managed by AFAD.[585] There were reports of aid trucks stopped and not let through unless ruling party placards and signs were placed on them, including stickers of the president placed on individual aid packages.[586] On 16 February the district governor of Pazarcik accompanied by the gendarmerie seized aid stored in a distribution center established jointly by the HDP and the Hasankoca Neighborhood Assistance and Solidarity Association in presence of the head of the Diyarbak\u0131r Chamber of Industry arguing they could not distribute aid independently.[577] On 9 February 2023, the governing alliance between the MHP and the AKP approved a state of emergency in 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes.[475][587] The opposition voted no to the measure, claiming that it was unnecessary since the provinces were already declared as \"disaster areas\".[475][587] A week after the earthquakes in Samanda\u011f, a coastal town in Hatay Province, residents dug through the rubble to look for victims because of the slow and limited government response. \"We have nothing left and the government barely helped us,\" one resident said, adding that assistance only came 48 hours after the earthquake.[588]"

The Peoples' Democratic Party said Twitter helped in organizing aid to the affected and the block would \"only cause more death.\" Ali Babacan, leader of the Turkey's opposition group, Democracy and Progress Party, also criticized the block.[591] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement critical of fines and penalties issued to Halk TV, Tele1\u00a0[diq; tr], and Fox over their coverage of the earthquake by the Radio and Television Supreme Council.

It added that a wider investigation into social media accounts was ongoing, but offered no information on the content of the posts.[594] The number of detentions increased to a dozen on 8 February.[595] Following reports of property being ransacked by looters,[596][597] authorities arrested 98 people for robbery or defrauding victims.[598] Syrians have faced increased discrimination in the country, with some Turks blaming them for the looting.[599][600][601] Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch alleged that Turkish security forces tortured and ill-treated individuals arrested on suspicion of looting. In a report from both organizations, one person died while being held by authorities. The report said allegations of torture came from 10 provinces, with most of them coming from Antakya alone.[602] On 9 February, minister of justice, Bekir Bozda\u011f, said a judicial investigation into the collapse of buildings was opened.[603] The probe attempts to hold accountable those who constructed the buildings or bore any responsibility for their collapse in the 10 hardest-hit provinces. Bozda\u011f said: \"Those who have negligence, faults and those responsible for the destructions after the earthquake will be identified and held accountable before the judiciary\".[603][604] Nearly 150 local prosecutors were authorized to establish units to investigate contractors, surveyors and other experts linked to the collapsed buildings.[605] On 11 February, the justice ministry announced the plan to establish the \"Earthquake Crimes Investigation\" bureaus. The bureaus aim to hold contractors and other responsible for construction, gathering evidence, recommendation experts; including architects geologists and engineers; and inspecting building permits and occupation permits.[606] Vice President Fuat Oktay said 131 individuals linked to the collapse of buildings were identified.[607] By 25 February 612 people were investigated for their involvement in building collapses; 184 were arrested and awaiting trial. Those in jail included contractors and building owners and managers.[608] On 12 February, the Adana Chief Public Prosecutor's Office issued arrest warrants for 62 people;[609] Thirty one arrests were made on 14 February. In Malatya, city prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 31 people.[610] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published an article on 14 February covering journalists being detained and harassed for their reporting on the earthquake in Turkey. Some of those detained were being investigated for \"spreading misinformation\" or for \"\"provoking the people into animosity and hatred\" in connection with their reporting.[611] The owner of R\u00f6nesans Rezidans which collapsed in Hatay Province was arrested in Istanbul while attempting to leave Turkey for Montenegro.[603] In Gaziantep Province, two people were arrested after being suspected of cutting-down columns to make extra space in a building that collapsed.[606] Bekir Bozda\u011f said 163 people were being investigated for their alleged involvement. Eight people were arrested and awaiting trial while 48 were held in police detention; another seven were prohibited from leaving Turkey. Officials detained two people at Istanbul Airport attempting to flee to Georgia. Among those arrested were a man and his wife who constructed several buildings in Adiyaman which collapsed. A contractor involved in developing the Bahar Apartments in Gaziantep was detained in Istanbul after his inspections were deemed negligent. The owner of a construction company which built several buildings in Adana was apprehended in Northern Cyprus.[610] The majority of buildings that collapsed in Turkey were constructed before 2000, but some were constructed after that year. Following the 1999 earthquake, building construction followed new regulations and had improved materials. Sukru Ersoy, a geology professor at Y\u0131ld\u0131z Technical University, said \"corruption is high in the construction sector in Turkey. And therefore, there were abuses\".[612] However, corruption was not always present in local authorities;[613] in Erzin, which has a strict policy against the construction of buildings that violated safety codes in addition to having endured other earthquakes with less damage, became a popular location for survivors elsewhere to take refuge as no collapsed buildings were reported.[614][615] On 3 January 2024, the first trials opened in Turkey relating to the earthquake, with a court in Adiyaman trying 11 individuals accused of \"conscious negligence\" while overseeing the construction of the collapsed Isias Hotel.[616] The families of those killed in the Isias Hotel collapsed testified against its owner and 10 contractors.[617] Attorneys representing victims' families said contractors tried may be handled a less severe sentence as evidence and collapsed rubble were cleared in the aftermath.[618] In mid-April 2024, trials began for eight defendants; four from the construction contractor and four from a private inspector involved with the R\u00f6nesans Rezidans. All the defendants pleaded not guilty. The luxury apartment collapsed, killing at least 269 and leaving 46 missing, believed to have also died. Four of the accused were held in detention while another was reportedly on the run. At the Hatay Third High Criminal Court, they were charged with \"causing the death and injury of more than one person with conscious negligence.\" The eight individuals face up to 22 years in jail if convicted.[619] The director for Human Rights Watch in Turkey voiced concerns that many public officials have not gone for trial, while only individuals from private sector have. Public servants also has a role in the construction of inadequate buildings such as issuing permits and consenting to building plans. No public servant has gone to trial as of 19 April 2024.[174]"

        "content": "Investigative reports revealed that Syrian government had deliberately obstructed aid to all of Syria's opposition-held areas, including the Idlib region, which was the worst-struck area in the earthquake.[625] Syrian government officials and state-run media blamed United States and European Union sanctions against the country for the lack of humanitarian aid and hampering rescue. On 10 February, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad[626] accused Western countries of having \"no regard for the human condition.\"[627] The US Treasury said its sanctions \"contain robust exemptions for humanitarian efforts\" in the first place, and that after the earthquake it issued a blanket authorization for relief efforts.[262] The United Nations has also been criticized for its policy of focusing aid shipments solely to the regime, at the expense of Syrian lives in opposition-held territories.[628] Idlib region, under the control of Syrian Salvation Government (SSG), was one of the hardest-hit territories.[629] Assad regime's policy of besieging North-West Syria; which blockades the supply of food, medicines and other humanitarian supplies, has further deteriorated the crisis in Idlib.[630] Abu Mohammad al-Julani, commander of the SSG-aligned Tahrir al-Sham rebel militia, criticized aid agencies of neglecting the situation in Idlib and called on the international community to be more proactive in reconstruction and relief efforts, adding that the \"United Nations needs to understand that it's required to help in a crisis\".[631] Upon traveling to the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing bordering the rebel-held territories, UNOCHA Under-Secretary Martin Griffith stated on 12 February that \"We have so far failed the people in north-west Syria\".[631] As of 13 February, Ankara and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army were accused of blocking aid convoys sent by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria from entering the north-west region.[632][633] The United Nations criticized Russia's attempts to block delivery of aid through checkpoints to rebel-held territories. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres urged the Security Council to immediately permit aid flows into Northwestern Syria.[634] United States appealed for the immediate opening of all closed checkpoints to send in relief efforts to all parts of Syria; calling for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to increase humanitarian assistance through Bab al-Hawa and open up more border crossings for the entry of UN aid.[631][634] St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesperson, said on 14 February, \"some aid is getting into the north-west, pointing to 58 trucks that arrived with aid through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing.\" However, the organization does not possess heavy equipment or search and rescue teams. He stressed that the \"international community as a whole needs to step up to get that aid where it is needed.\"[531] Raed al-Saleh, chief of Syrian Civil Defence, strongly rebuked the UN for its negligence and delay in responding to the rescue efforts: \"Let me be clear: The White Helmets received no support from the United Nations during the most critical moments of the rescue operations.. The UN's failure to respond quickly to this catastrophe is shameful. When I asked the UN why help had failed to arrive in time, the answer I received was bureaucracy. In the face of one of the deadliest catastrophes to strike the world in years, it seems the UN's hands were tied by red tape.\"[625]"

International health organizations said the shortage of clean water would be a public health risk. The World Health Organization said water shortage \"increases the risk of waterborne diseases and outbreaks of communicable diseases.\"[637] On 18 February, Turkey's Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said there was an increase in intestinal and upper respiratory infection cases but \"numbers did not pose a serious threat to public health.\"[128] At a stadium serving as shelter in Kahramanmara\u015f, a clinic managed by 15 to 30 medics attended up to 10,000 patients in the day. The clinic provided tetanus shots and sanitary items to residents. Many people at the stadium were unable to shower and the six toilets were unable to accommodate to the large number of people. In Antakya, residents said more portable toilets were needed.[637] Health authorities in Turkey had to ensure earthquake survivors were free of disease. The World Health Organization collaborated with local authorities to monitor the rates of waterborne diseases, seasonal influenza and COVID-19 among the affected.[637]"

A silent march was held in Adiyaman while President Erdo\u011fan is expected to visit Kahramanmara\u015f. Protests were also held in Antakya criticizing health minister Fahrettin Koca and mayor L\u00fctf\u00fc Sava\u015f, with demonstrators chanting \"Can anyone hear me?\", a reminder of cries for rescue following the earthquake and \"We won't forget, we won't forgive.\" In Malatya Province, the governor banned events that were not officially sanctioned until 9 February.[638]"

        "content": " Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Vayu (/\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0ju\u02d0/) was a strong tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage in India during June 2019. It was the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the Saurashtra Peninsula of northwestern India since the 1998 Gujarat cyclone.[1][2] Vayu was the third tropical depression, third cyclonic storm and second very severe cyclonic storm of the 2019 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, and the first of which to form in the Arabian Sea. Vayu originated from a low-pressure area that was first noted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on 9\u00a0June, near the northern Maldives. After consolidating into a depression, the storm tracked slowly north-northwestward over the eastern Arabian Sea, and reached cyclonic storm intensity late on 10\u00a0June. Steady strengthening continued into 11\u00a0June, and the storm underwent rapid intensification late in the day. Vayu reached peak intensity as a high-end very severe cyclonic storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC on 12\u00a0June, with three-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 970\u00a0hPa (28.64\u00a0inHg).[3] Despite initially being forecast to make landfall in the state of Gujarat, Vayu turned abruptly to the west on 13\u00a0June and moved away from the coast. The system weakened gradually as it tracked slowly towards the Arabian Peninsula, then weakened more quickly after beginning to accelerate back towards India on 16 June. Vayu was downgraded to a deep depression the following morning, and further to a depression a few hours later. The system degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure area late on 17\u00a0June, just before crossing the Gujarat coast. Vayu's remnants continued inland for several more hours, before dissipating on 18\u00a0June. In total, as many as 6.6\u00a0million people in northwestern India were impacted by the cyclone.[4] Approximately 300,000 residents of coastal Gujarat were evacuated on 12\u00a0June in preparation for the system's arrival,[1] and thousands of personnel were deployed to the region to assist with preparations, rescue operations and clean up efforts. As of 18\u00a0June, eight people are reported to have been killed either directly or indirectly by the cyclone, and at least 12 more injured.[5][6][7][8][9] The name Vayu was provided by India, and is derived from a Sanskrit and Hindi word meaning 'wind'.[10]"

        "content": "In early June, a strong pulse of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards into the tropical Indian Ocean, leading to increased cloudiness and rainfall across the region.[11] The presence of the pulse also contributed to enhanced convective activity, and generated conditions which were supportive of tropical cyclogenesis.[12] On 9\u00a0June, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) noted the development of a low-pressure area over the southeastern Arabian Sea, to the north of the Maldives.[13] Organisation increased throughout the day, and owing to the improved structure of the system, the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 22:30\u00a0UTC.[14] At 00:00\u00a0UTC the following day, the IMD indicated that the low-pressure area had consolidated into a tropical depression, and assigned it the designation ARB\u00a001.[15] Conditions were favourable for further intensification, with improving upper-level divergence, and ample energy being provided by extremely warm sea surface temperatures of 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F).[14][16] Vertical wind shear also continued to decrease as the depression tracked steadily north-northwestwards parallel to the western coast of India under the influence of an anticyclone over central India.[17] Deep convection strengthened around the low-level circulation centre, and the system was upgraded to a deep depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[18] Six hours later, the JTWC assessed one-minute sustained winds as having reached 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), and designated the system as Tropical Cyclone\u00a002A.[19] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on 10\u00a0June, the system strengthened into the third cyclonic storm of the season, and was named Vayu by the IMD.[20] Vayu continued to steadily strengthen after intensifying into a cyclonic storm. A formative eye began to develop on 11\u00a0June, as intense deep convection wrapped tightly around the system. Vayu became a severe cyclonic storm by 12:00\u00a0UTC, and reached Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).[21] Shortly afterwards, the cyclone began a period of rapid intensification; however, the rate of intensification was tempered somewhat by strong vertical wind shear. Vayu was upgraded to a very severe cyclonic storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC, and continued to strengthen through 00:00\u00a0UTC on 12\u00a0June, at which point the system became a Category\u00a02-equivalent tropical cyclone on the SSHWS.[22] One-minute sustained winds increased to 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) six hours later as a ragged eye developed on visible-light satellite imagery, surrounded by strong deep convection, particularly in the western semicircle of the storm.[23] The intensification trend then slowed, however, with three-minute sustained winds only increasing further to 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) by 12:00\u00a0UTC.[24] Vayu's intensity soon plateaued as ocean heat content began to decrease and drier air began to infiltrate the cyclone's circulation.[25][26] As Vayu approached the coastline of the state of Gujarat in northwestern India, the influence of a strengthening subtropical ridge over Saudi Arabia caused the system to gradually slow down and turn towards the west.[27][28] At 12:00 UTC on 13 June, the JTWC indicated that lower vertical wind shear had allowed Vayu to strengthen, noting that the eye had become more distinct. Vayu's intensity was now equivalent to a minimal Category 3 major hurricane on the SSHWS, with one-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[29] Vayu began to weaken on 14 June as it tracked slowly westward, away from the Gujarat coastline.[30] Despite the low wind shear and warm ocean, upper-level outflow from the storm had begun to diminish, allowing the dry air entrainment from the northwest to start eroding the cyclone.[31] The central dense overcast and circulation centre became increasingly ragged and elongated as deep convection diminished and started to become displaced. Vayu weakened to Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone status at 12:00 UTC,[32] as the loose central convection expanded to leave a ragged eye 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) in diameter.[33] Vayu's slow westward track through the weak competing steering environment over the northern Arabian Sea brought the system into an environment of high easterly vertical wind shear.[34] The majority of deep convection became confined to the cyclone's southern quadrants,[34] causing the system to weaken to a severe cyclonic storm at 00:00 UTC on 16 June.[35] An approaching mid-latitude trough weakened the areas of high pressure centred to the west and northeast,[31] Vayu recurved sharply to the northeast.[36] Upon weakening further to a cyclonic storm, strong low-level southwesterly flow caused the system to accelerate northeastwards through the break in the blocking high-pressure ridge, back towards the Gujarat coast.[31][37] Strong vertical wind shear and dry air ingestion from the western semicircle of the storm's circulation continued to erode the cyclone, and Vayu weakened into a deep depression at 03:00 UTC on 17 June,[38] with the JTWC issuing their final advisory at this time.[39] The system was downgraded further to a depression by the IMD six hours later.[40] Soon afterwards, the IMD issued their final advisory on the system after Vayu degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure area, just before crossing the Gujarat coast near the India\u2013Pakistan border.[41] On 18 June, Vayu's remnants slowly moved inland, while continuing to weaken, before dissipating later that day.[citation needed]"

        "content": "As the system intensified into a deep depression, the IMD issued a pre-cyclone watch for the coastline of the state of Gujarat. The agency indicated that further strengthening into a cyclonic storm within the following 24\u00a0hours was very likely. Fishermen were warned not to venture into the Arabian Sea near the developing system or in the forecast path of the cyclone, and mariners already at sea were urged to return to the coast.[42] The pre-watch for the Gujarat coastline was upgraded to a yellow cyclone alert at 12:00\u00a0UTC on 10\u00a0June, with forecasts predicting landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm on 12\u00a0June.[17] This was further upgraded to an orange  alert on 11\u00a0June.[43] The IMD warned that thatched houses in the path of the cyclone were likely to be completely destroyed, and that kutcha houses could sustain significant damage. The IMD also indicated that a storm surge of 1.5\u20132.0\u00a0m (4.9\u20136.6\u00a0ft) was possible, and had the potential to inundate low-lying coastal areas.[44] Tropical cyclones are relatively infrequent in northwestern India and the northern Arabian Sea. Gujarat had not experienced a hurricane-force tropical cyclone landfall since an unnamed system struck the region as an extremely severe cyclonic storm in June 1998, causing more than 10,000 fatalities.[1] As Vayu was initially forecast to make landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm, the potential for major impacts prompted significant preparation measures in the state. Beginning on the morning of 12\u00a0June, the Indian government evacuated approximately 300,000 people living in coastal regions of Gujarat to 2000 shelter homes,[1][45][46] as well as 10,000 people from the nearby island of Diu.[47] All schools and colleges in the area were also closed to safeguard students and staff.[1] All flights at airports in Porbandar, Diu, Bhavnagar, Keshod and Kandla were grounded from midnight local time on 13\u00a0June, and 77 train services cancelled and 38 others shortened.[48] In Mumbai, ferry services were suspended,[2] more than 128 train services were cancelled or shortened,[9] and approximately 400 flights were affected by delays or diversions as the cyclone passed to the west on 12\u201313\u00a0June.[10] All ports in Gujarat suspended operations from 12\u00a0June, and many vessels which had been berthed there departed the ports for safety.[10][49] Approximately 2,300 personnel in 52 teams from the National Disaster Response Force were deployed to Gujarat help local authorities with evacuation efforts, as well as to aid in search, rescue and relief operations after the cyclone.[1][10] Personnel from the state reserve police were deployed to the region, as well as 300 commandos from the state marine police. Boats and aircraft were sent to various locations across Gujarat to enable and assist search and rescue operations if required.[50] The Indian Coast Guard, Army, Navy and Air Force were also all put on alert, with about 2,400 army personnel in 34 teams placed on standby, and naval diving teams assembled to conduct water rescues if necessary.[1][10][50][51] Police officers also conducted night patrols to ensure that no residents were left behind in evacuated areas.[50]"

The IMD warned that heavy rainfall and large waves were expected, and had the potential to inundate low-lying areas such as the coastal salt marshes. As a precaution, the local government in the Kutch district of northern Gujarat asked salt pan workers in coastal areas from Bhachau to Mundra to stay home from work. The government noted that five teams from the NDRF that had been deployed in the initial large-scale preparatory measures would remain in Kutch for the anticipated landfall, and that several teams of local officers had been formed to help maintain safety and security throughout the event. Plans were made to evacuate local residents at short notice if required.[52]"

        "header": "Impacts",
        "content": "Despite not making landfall, Cyclone Vayu tracked close enough to the Indian coastline to produce minor impacts. Strong winds, heavy rainfall and large waves were experienced along large sections of the country's western coast, particularly in Gujarat.[53] Numerous thatched houses were either damaged or destroyed by gusty winds, with many kutcha houses having their roofs torn off.[6] A large number of tin sheds were blown away, and many trees were uprooted along the Saurashtra coast and on the island of Diu.[50][54] Strong winds caused the 150-year-old Bhuteshwar Mahadev temple in Porbandar to collapse and a metal shed at Somnath Temple to be damaged.[50][55][48] Damage to power lines and electricity poles caused power cuts in more than 2,250 villages in Gujarat, with blackouts lasting for several days in some locations.[56][57] The prolonged strong winds generated waves of around 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) high along large parts of the coastline.[48] Many low-lying coastal areas on the Saurashtra coast and southern Gujarat were flooded by waves and tides of up to 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) in height,[54] and severe damage was caused to at least 15 houses in the city of Ullal.[58] Local fishermen in Porbandar sustained \u20b910 million (US$140,000) in damages as strong winds and waves caused as many as 25 small boats to sink, and one larger boat to receive significant damage. In Veraval, about 20 small boats and five larger boats were also damaged.[57] Fishermen complained that there had been inadequate room to safely anchor their vessels during the cyclone, which was responsible for the damage.[59] Some fishermen in Veraval also had to be rescued after their boats capsized in the large waves, with one person being hospitalised due to their injuries.[8][60] Moderate to heavy rainfall occurred in more than 100 tehsils across Gujarat. The highest observed rainfall total was at Talala in the Gir-Somnath district, where 160 millimetres (6.3\u00a0in) of precipitation was recorded.[61] Veraval also experienced heavy rainfall, with 67 millimetres (2.6\u00a0in) falling in just six hours.[62] In southern Gujarat, lightning strikes killed five people and injured two others. Many of the victims had been working on farms during heavy rain and thunderstorms when they were struck.[6][8] A motorist was also killed after being hit by a falling tree on the side of the road while driving home.[6] In the town of Chamba in northern India, houses and roads were damaged by flash flooding and hail from a severe thunderstorm associated with Vayu.[50] Rainfall associated with Vayu continued for several days in the state of Maharashtra, with the city of Nashik receiving 92.1 millimetre (0.039\u00a0in) of precipitation in a 24-hour period on 15\u201316 June.[63] Cyclone Vayu also caused impacts in other parts of India. Mumbai experienced strong sustained winds which peaked just below gale-force at 58\u00a0km/h (36\u00a0mph) after midday on 12 June. Several trees fell throughout the city, resulting in at least four injuries, and blocking a road for many hours.[9] A pedestrian was killed and two others were injured when an aluminium cladding sheet fell from Churchgate railway station. The family of the deceased victim received \u20b9500,000 (US$7,000) as an ex gratia payment from the railway company.[64] Three pedestrians were injured by an acrylic sheet that had fallen from a skywalk due to strong winds.[5] A hoarding also collapsed near a train station in Thane, although no injuries were reported.[9] Strong winds also produced a large dust storm in the Indian capital, New Delhi, on 12 June.[65] Crude oil and plastic waste were washed up onto beaches on the Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg coasts by waves generated by Vayu.[66][67] Enhanced waves and ocean swell generated by Cyclone Vayu while it was located in the northern Arabian Sea also affected some coastal areas of Oman, including the South Al Sharqiyah governorate. The waves caused minor flooding of low-lying areas in various towns along the coast, including Al Suwaih and Ras Al Hid. Seawater caused some houses to become flooded, as well as local beaches and surrounding areas. Floodwaters also caused several vehicles to drift from where they were parked.[68] Large waves also caused minor flooding in about ten villages in coastal regions of southern Pakistan.[69] The onset of the Indian monsoon had been delayed past its usual commencement by about one week due to near-El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean throughout 2019.[70][71] The formation of Cyclone Vayu caused a further week's delay in the monsoon's progression towards northern India by drawing clouds and moisture over the Arabian Sea, away from the developing monsoon trough.[45][72] The severe heat wave in Pakistan was also exacerbated by Vayu. The anticlockwise rotation of the cyclone's wind field caused typical cool onshore winds to be replaced by hot winds from the desert to the north.[73] Temperatures of above 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) were experienced in numerous cities across the country, including the coastal city of Karachi.[73][74] One elderly resident in Karachi died of heat stroke on 15 June, and numerous other people were treated in hospitals and medical clinics for symptoms such as dehydration, dizziness and exhaustion.[7]"

        "content": " Typhoon Ewiniar, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Aghon, was a fairly strong tropical cyclone that impacted parts of the Philippines, particularly Luzon, in May 2024. The first named storm and typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Ewiniar emerged from an area of atmospheric convection 441\u00a0km (274\u00a0mi) southeast of Palau. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) labeled the system as a low-pressure area on May 21. It intensified on May 23 and became a tropical depression, giving it the name Aghon by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration after entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility, marking it as the fifth-latest start of a Pacific typhoon season since reliable records began; the depression intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Ewiniar. The cyclone made nine landfalls in the Philippines. Afterward, it began to move over the warm tropical waters of Lamon Bay, where the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the JMA upgraded Ewiniar into a minimal typhoon. Beginning to weaken for the final time on May 30, the storm passed directly over the island of Minamidait\u014djima and began an extratropical transition. It was last noted by the JMA early on June 2, near the International Dateline, and absorbed into another extratropical cyclone just south of Prince William Sound on June 6. Strong winds and flooding caused power outages and disruptions of transport, with rough seas stranding over 7,175 people in various ports, and more than 152,266 people were directly impacted. In Japan, heavy rainfall was observed in several regions, with a maximum of 52.5\u00a0mm (2.07\u00a0in) of rain being recorded in Miyake, Tokyo. Agricultural damage in the Philippines totaled \u20b185.63 million (US$1.74 million). Damage to infrastructure was valued at \u20b1942.55 million (US$19.14 million). In all, the typhoon killed at least six people and left eight injured, resulting in at least \u20b11.03 billion (US$20.88 million) in damages."

        "content": "Typhoon Ewiniar emerged from an area of atmospheric convection 441\u00a0km (274\u00a0mi) southeast of Palau. The disturbance was moving northwestward towards an environment favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, characterized by sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F), low vertical wind shear, and moderate to strong outflow aloft associated with an upper tropospheric trough west of the system.[1] On May 22, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 1] labeled the system as a low-pressure area.[2] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) as the disturbance developed rainbands wrapping from the southwest, with deep convection obscuring the system's consolidated circulation center.[4] At 18:00 UTC on May 23, the JMA identified the system as a tropical depression,[5] and later that day, it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).[6] However, later that day, the JTWC cancelled their TCFA, since the depression was still weak.[7] Early morning of May 24, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration upgraded the system from a low-pressure area into a depression, assigning it with the name Aghon \u2014 a Hiligaynon word for a mariner's compass and the replacement name for Ambo, marking it as the fifth-latest start of a Pacific typhoon season since reliable records began.[8][9][nb 3] The JTWC then reissued a TCFA on the system while it was 233\u00a0km (145\u00a0mi) northeast of Davao City, Philippines.[10] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 01W based on surface observations from Guiuan.[11] Aghon made its first landfalls over Homonhon Island and Giporlos in Eastern Samar in the early morning of May 25 (PHT).[12] At 12:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a tropical storm while it was still in Tayabas Bay.[13] In the evening, it made five more landfalls over Basiao and Cagduyong Islands of Catbalogan, Samar; Batuan in Ticao Island; Masbate City; and Torrijos, Marinduque.[14] The JMA then classified the system as a tropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC, assigning it the name Ewiniar.[15] In the morning of May 26 (PHT), the storm made its 8th landfall over Lucena, Quezon in Luzon island;[16] nonetheless, the system developed a small dense overcast holding a ragged, formative eye.[17] The JTWC then reported that Ewiniar had rapidly intensified into a typhoon due to strong equatorward and poleward outflow.[18] In the evening, the storm made its ninth landfall over Patnanungan in the Polillo Islands;[19] however, the outermost deep convective was diminishing because of the topographical effects from  Luzon island, and the further development of a poleward outflow channel.[20] Ewiniar then turned northwestward along the northwestern edge of a mid-level subtropical high.[21] Soon after, the JMA upgraded Ewiniar to a severe tropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC on May 26 as its maximum sustained winds increased to 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[6] By 18:00 UTC that same day, Ewiniar had intensified into a typhoon, marking it as the first typhoon of the 2024 Pacific typhoon season;[22] although its structure consolidated, the system's pinhole eye became obscured by cirrus clouds.[23] At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC estimated maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 2-equivalent intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale, though it was slightly weakening as a result of moderate wind shear.[24] Infrared satellite imagery showed a partially-exposed circulation center with deep convection over the southern portion of the storm;[25] however, Ewiniar maintained its convective symmetric structure as it accelerated northeastward.[26] On May 27, the JMA recorded maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970\u00a0hPa (28.64\u00a0inHg) as the system's peak intensity.[6] The storm then deteriorated from subsidence from a mid-latitude trough aloft as evidence by the structure's erosion and warming cloud tops.[27] The center was still well-defined, as its outflow was enhanced by a longwave trough, though wind shear was moderate.[28] At 12:00\u00a0PHT (04:00\u00a0UTC) on May 29, the typhoon left the PAR.[29] Shortly afterwards, it passed directly over the island of Minamidait\u014djima.[30] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, Ewiniar had weakened into a severe tropical storm.[6] Environmental conditions became more unfavorable as sea surface temperatures decrease and vertical shear increases, as dry air invaded the system from the lower troposphere.[31] Stratocumulus cloud lines went towards the elongated central convection due to this while the storm accelerated along the subtropical ridge to its northeast, weakening into a tropical storm as according to the JTWC.[32] On May 30, the JTWC reported that Ewiniar had begun losing its tropical characteristics while 719\u00a0km (447\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan.[33] Moreover, the JMA downgraded Ewiniar to a tropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[34] The storm then developed a cold front to its southwest as deep convection detached from the fully-exposed and asymmetrical center, briefly becoming a subtropical cyclone.[35] By 18:00\u00a0UTC on that day, the JMA reported that Ewiniar had transitioned into an extratropical low.[36] The JTWC then ceased issuing advisories on the system the next day as it entered the baroclinic zone and an area of high wind shear.[37] The extratropical remnants of Ewiniar were last noted by the JMA on June 2 near the International Dateline;[6] however, the Ocean Prediction Center indicated that these extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline and entered the Central North Pacific Ocean late on June 3.[38][39] On June 6, Ewiniar's remnant was absorbed into another extratropical cyclone, just south of Prince William Sound.[40]"

A power outage occurred in parts of Eastern Samar.[59] A falling tree destroyed two vehicles in Taytay, Rizal.[60] Flooding and power outages occurred in Quezon and Laguna Provinces, while a barge ran aground in Mauban.[61][62] A landslide blocked a road in Dinapigue, Isabela.[63] Rough sea conditions also damaged an oil container on board a ship in New Washington, Aklan, causing an oil spill.[64] Around 7,175 were stranded in ports across the Philippines due to the storm.[65] As rains continued throughout the day, the Angat Dam reached its spilling level of 179.79 meters (589.9\u00a0ft), while the Ipo Dam also reached its spilling level of 99.96 meters (328.0\u00a0ft).[66] A total of 7,659 homes were affected, including 752 which were destroyed.[43][67] Power outages were reported in 115 cities and municipalities.[43] At least 21,000\u00a0ha (52,000 acres) of farmland in Calabarzon, Bicol Region, and Eastern Visayas suffered damage.[68] Across the Philippines, roads were blocked in 57 places, and two bridge was rendered impassable by vehicles.[43] Nineteen houses were washed away by strong waves in Tanza, Cavite.[69] One infant drowned after a house was swept away by floods in Padre Burgos, Quezon,[70] while two others were killed by falling trees in San Antonio, Quezon and Lucena.[71] A minor was also killed by a falling tree in Misamis Oriental.[72] After Ewiniar left the Philippines, Lucena, Quezon was declared in a state of calamity.[73] along with the 1st and 2nd districts of Quezon.[74][75] The NDRRMC reports that assistance and relief goods worth \u20b115.52 million (US$315,092.86) have been distributed to affected families. The assistance provided varies, both in type and agency responsible, with most of the relief provided being food packs from the Department of Social Welfare and Development.[43] The government also provided  \u20b11.2 million (US$24,365.48) and an allocation of \u20b13 billion (US$60.91 million) worth of aid to the victims.[76][77] As of June 6, 2024, the NDRRMC estimated damages in the agricultural sector reaching over \u20b185.63 million (US$1.74 million).

The seventh named storm and third typhoon of the annual typhoon season. Ampil emerged from an atmospheric convection east of Kadena Air Base and was later classified as a tropical storm on August 12 and named Ampil by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Ampil gradually intensified as it turned northward, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 950\u00a0hPa (28.05\u00a0inHg) before peaking at Category 4-equivalent intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale on August 16, with one-minute sustained winds of  215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) before making its closest approach to Japan. It then rapidly weakened as it began to undergo an extratropical transition on August 19. The remnants of Ampil accelerated east-northeastward, entering the Bering Sea, crossing the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, and then moving inland over the Russian Far East and Arctic Alaska before emerging into the Arctic Ocean and dissipated on August 23. Ampil affected Japan during the Obon holiday week, shortly after Tropical Storm Maria caused unprecedented rainfall to northern Japan. As the storm neared the coast, hundreds of thousands in Tokyo and nearby regions were urged to evacuate. Numerous modes of transportation, such as flights and trains, were canceled due to the approaching typhoon. The NHK reported that Tokyo suffered minimal damage, while several people were injured in Kanagawa Prefecture. However, Japan was struck by a more powerful cyclone named  Typhoon Shanshan one week later. Later, the remnants of Ampil caused a high surf advisory, a high wind watch, and a coastal flood advisory in Alaska, bringing strong winds and coastal waves to western Alaska. Ampil contributed to an atmospheric river when its moist core entered a low-pressure system and merged with the Pacific jet stream, which was anticipated to reach California."

A total of around 178,000 households, over 404,000 people, were given an evacuation order. Similar notices were issued in Yokohama. Many modes of transportation like flights and trains were cancelled on August 16 as the typhoon approached.[29] Japan Airways and All Nippon Airways cancelled around 600 flights to Haneda Airport and Narita International Airport.[30][31] East of Tokyo in the Chiba Prefecture, trees were downed and many roads were flooded. In Tokyo and in multiple bordering regions, heavy rainfall affected areas, increasing the risk of flooding and landslides. High waves warnings were issued, mainly in the Izu Islands.[32] The Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) was raised from TCCOR 3 to TCCOR 2 for Yokosuka Naval Base on August 15, indicating that winds of 92\u00a0km/h (57\u00a0mph) or higher were possible within 24 hours.[33] A barrier obstructing Japan's Mount Fuji from a nearby convenience store was recently taken down to avoid damage.[34] A Level 4 evacuation order was issued for Mobara and Asahi in Chiba Prefecture, along with Iwaki in Fukushima Prefecture.[35] All buslines in the city of Mobara were cancelled. Tokyo Disneyland closed around six hours before normal closing time, and it was closed all together on August 17. The cancellation of flights and railway transportation was expected to impact over 120,000 people.[32] The NHK reported that Tokyo suffered minimal damage, while several people were injured in Kanagawa Prefecture.[35] Over 5,000 homes were left without power, though only 250 in both Ibaraki and Tochigi. Signboards were damaged, as well as bicyles and poles getting knocked over by strong winds.

        "content": "Typhoon Shanshan was a powerful tropical cyclone that moved through Japan in August 2024. The tenth named storm and fourth typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Shanshan was first noted near the Mariana Islands on August 20, with deep convection beginning to consolidate. The following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Shanshan. Early the next day, both the JMA and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as a minimal typhoon. Shanshan turned west-northwestward and stalled near Kikaijima, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 935\u00a0hPa (27.61\u00a0inHg). It then peaked at Category 4-equivalent intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale on August 27, with one-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph). As the typhoon moved through the Ryukyu Islands, it further decayed, becoming cooler and less defined. Shanshan turned northward between two mid-level subtropical ridges and made landfall near Satsumasendai in Kagoshima Prefecture around 8 a.m. local time on August 29. It then turned eastward along the northern edge of a subtropical high and quickly crossed the Seto Inland Sea before making landfall over the northern tip of Shikoku on August 30. Shanshan's convection has slightly increased over the past six hours as its circulation moved back over open water and began progressing east-southeastward due to interaction with a mid-latitude trough. It then moved inland over Japan and dissipated on September 1. After Tropical Storm Maria and Typhoon Ampil impacted Japan, Shanshan arrived a few days later. In preparation for Shanshan, storm warnings were issued for 14 communities in the  Satsuma and \u014csumi areas of Kagoshima Prefecture, and on August 28, the JMA issued special weather warnings for Kagoshima Prefecture. This was the first emergency warning issued for Kagoshima Prefecture since Typhoon Nanmadol in 2022. As Shanshan brushed the islands of Amami \u014cshima and Kikaijima, maximum sustained wind gusts near 100 miles per hour (160\u00a0km/h) were recorded at Kikai Airport on the latter island. The JMA began issuing landslide and rockslide warnings in Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Shizuoka prefectures. As Shanshan moved ashore in Kyushu, a wind gust of 85 miles per hour (137\u00a0km/h) was recorded in Makurazaki, Kagoshima. Meanwhile, heavy rainfall from Shanshan affected the South Korean island of Jeju. In all, the typhoon killed at least eight people, injured 127 others, and damaged hundreds of structures throughout Japan. Damages are estimated at US$6\u201310 billion.[3]"

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Shanshan can be traced back to August 20, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed near the Mariana Islands.[4] At midnight on August 21, both the JMA and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the tropical depression, with the latter designating the system as 11W due to deep convection beginning to consolidate into a central dense overcast.[5][6] Shortly after, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Shanshan by the JMA due to low vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, and high ocean heat content.[7] However, Shanshan's movement was nearly stationary due to the weak steering flow.[7] Around 12:00 UTC on August 22, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm, citing Dvorak technique\u2014a method of determining a tropical cyclone's intensity based on satellite appearance.[8] A ragged eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery on August 23,[9] and early the next day, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded it to a minimal typhoon.[10] Shanshan began developing poleward outflow into the west-northwest edge of a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell and then turned northward due to the interaction with an upper vortex.[11][12] Despite its medium size, it quickly organized and developed a pinhole eye on satellite imagery, with deep convection wrapping around an obscured low-level circulation center.[13] However, due to moderate wind shear, Shanshan became partially exposed and poorly organized;[14] nonetheless, on August 26, deep convection began to increase rapidly,[15] with Shanshan developing a compact eye that was obscured by cirrus cloud.[16][17] Shanshan then turned west-northwestward along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level subtropical high.[18] The typhoon displayed a symmetrical structure with a clear eye measuring 12.7 miles (20.4\u00a0km) in diameter,[19] which later became cloud-filled and was encircled by symmetric deep convection.[20] Shanshan underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, in which the inner eyewall deteriorated while being encased by a clearly defined outer eyewall.[21] Shanshan completed its eyewall replacement cycle on August 27 and began rapidly intensifying again,[22] featuring a symmetric eye with a diameter of 29\u201335 miles (46\u201356\u00a0km) while stalling near Kikaijima, surrounded by cold cloud tops at \u221294\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221270\u00a0\u00b0C).[23] The JMA reported that Shanshan reached its peak intensity at 15:00 UTC with 10-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 935\u00a0hPa (27.61\u00a0inHg),[24] before eventually peaking at Category 4-equivalent intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale with 1-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph).[25] A study by Imperial College London suggests that Shanshan's extreme winds and heavy precipitation were strengthened by climate change.[26] After reaching its peak intensity, the typhoon's structure further decayed on August 28, becoming cooler and less defined, which coincided with a warming of the eyewall cloud tops as it moved through the Ryukyu Islands.[27] Shanshan then turned northward between two mid-level subtropical ridges and made landfall near Satsumasendai in Kagoshima Prefecture around 8 a.m. local time on August 29.[28][29] This made Shanshan the strongest typhoon to strike Japan in decades and one of the most powerful storms to make landfall since 1960.[30] After the system made landfall, satellite imagery and radar loops showed the rapid erosion and disintegration of convective tops and feeder bands.[31] Owing to its interaction with rugged terrain, Shanshan weakened to a minimal tropical storm.[32] It then turned eastward along the northern periphery of a subtropical high,[33] quickly crossed the Seto Inland Sea, and made landfall over the northern tip of Shikoku on August 30.[34] By that time, its convection had diminished, and the low-level circulation center had become disorganized;[35] however, convection slightly increased after six hours as Shanshan's circulation moved back over open water and began moving east-southeastward due to the interaction with a mid-latitude trough.[36][37] Around 09:00 UTC on August 31, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system as it had become an exposed circulation center surrounded by stratocumulus clouds.[38] On September 1, Shanshan re-intensified into a weak tropical depression with 25\u00a0km/h (16\u00a0mph) winds and a well-defined circulation in the eastern semicircle, leading the JTWC to resume advisories as it drifted poleward along the northwestern edge of a low to mid-level subtropical ridge.[39] However, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system as it moved inland over Japan.[40]  The JMA continued to monitor the system until it dissipated at 18:00 UTC that day.[41]"

A Level 5 emergency warning\u2014the highest level of warning\u2014was issued for Mishima, affecting 369 residents. Across parts of Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures, Level 4 evacuation notices were posted, which included 27 cities in Kagoshima Prefecture and the city of Miyazaki.[45] Evacuation orders were issued for 996,299 people in Miyazaki Prefecture and 982,273 people in Kagoshima Prefecture.[46] Level 4 evacuation alerts were also issued for portions of Aichi Prefecture and Shizuoka Prefecture;[45] a total of 342,666 people in Shizuoka Prefecture were given evacuation orders.[1] The threat of mudslides caused the JMA to began issuing landslide and rockslide warnings in Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Shizuoka prefectures.[47] The Tokaido Shinkansen route was closed between Tokyo Station and Shin-\u014csaka Station, as well as between Hamamatsu Station and Toyohashi Station, due to rainfall amounts exceeding the regulatory limits for operation. The entire Kyushu Shinkansen route closed on August 29.[48][49] Japan Airlines cancelled 402 domestic flights and ten international flights between August 28 and August 30. All Nippon Airways also cancelled 210 domestic flights for the same timeframe. Over 18,400 airline passengers were affected by these cancellations.[50] In South Korea, a strong wind and heavy rain advisory were issued for the island of Jeju.[51] Expressways and toll stations were briefly closed at some locations, though services were restored. Commuters were advised to be aware of traffic disruptions.[44] The Japan Post suspended postal and delivery services in Kyushu.[52] Classes were cancelled at schools in Fukuoka,[53] Kagoshima,[54] and Yamaguchi prefectures.[55] The Super GT announced that the second Suzuka round would be postponed to December 7\u20138.[56] Multiple factories ceased operations for the duration of the typhoon, affecting companies such as Toyota which closed 14 plants, Nissan which closed a facility in Kyushu, Honda which closed a facility in Kumamoto, and Mazda which announced a potential closure of factories in Hiroshima and H\u014dfu.[50] Department stores and other commercial facilities in Kagoshima and Aira were closed.[57] Supermarkets also planned to close early across Kyushu.[52] Overall, 5,210,258 people were ordered to evacuate across 12 prefectures.[1]"

Bebinca made landfall in Shanghai, China, becoming the strongest typhoon to hit the city since Typhoon Gloria in 1949. The thirteenth named storm and sixth typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Bebinca formed from atmospheric convection 385\u00a0km (239\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Kosrae, was upgraded to a tropical storm by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) on September 10, and was named Bebinca, before turning west-northwest due to interaction with an upper vortex; by September 13, as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration named it Ferdie, and it eventually moved across the Ryukyu Islands, where both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the JMA upgraded it to a minimal typhoon. Inland, Bebinca quickly weakened to a severe tropical storm due to land interaction as it moved west-northwest under the steering influence of the subtropical high. The JMA tracked the system until it was last noted on September 18. Although Typhoon Bebinca did not make landfall in the Philippines, its associated trough and the southwest monsoon brought heavy rains to many regions, damaging or destroying nearly 97 homes and displacing over 36,626 people. The storm caused at least six fatalities, with two people missing and eleven injuries. In China, Bebinca caused two fatalities and one injury, but the country was soon impacted by Tropical Storm Pulasan just days later. Bebinca significantly affected Guam, leading to storm warnings being issued, while Brunei experienced wind gusts of up to 80 kilometers per hour, uprooting trees and blocking roads. In Japan, thousands of homes lost power in Amami, and high winds were recorded in Okinawa Prefecture. Overall, Bebinca caused an estimated US$2.49\u00a0billion in damage across the Philippines and China."

        "content": "Typhoon Bebinca emerged from an area of atmospheric convection 385\u00a0km (239\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Kosrae on September 5.[1] The system, characterized by a disorganized wave in the easterlies, featured intense deep convection over a large area, supported by favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis,[2] such as warm sea surface temperatures of 28\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F), moderate vertical wind shear and good poleward outflow.[3] At 02:30 UTC on September 9, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, noting that the system had become well-defined with formative banding in the eastern quadrants.[4] A few hours later, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the JTWC followed suit and upgraded the tropical depression, with the latter designating the system as 14W.[5][6] On September 10, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Bebinca by the JMA,[7] as it consolidated with a central dense overcast (CDO) feature obscuring its circulation center while tracking near Guam,[7] and subsequently turned west-northwestward due to interaction with an upper vortex.[8] Guam radar imagery showed a well-defined surface circulation, with curved convective bands extending southward from the circulation center and wrapping around the northern part of the system into its western periphery.[9] Around 00:00 UTC on September 11, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm, citing Dvorak technique\u2014a method of determining a tropical cyclone's intensity based on satellite appearance.[10] On September 13, the JMA reported that the storm had weakened to a tropical storm due to its near-surface circulation being fully exposed and its banding being fragmented along the northern edge,[11] with a broad tail of deep monsoonal flow and a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell to the west continuing to infuse dry air into the storm's mid-level core.[12] By 06:00 PHT (10:00 UTC), Bebinca had entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and was subsequently named  Ferdie by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA),[13] but just a few hours later, it exited the PAR.[14] Bebinca then shifted northwestward along the northern edge of a deep subtropical high,[15] and the JMA reported that the storm had regained severe tropical storm status.[16] Satellite imagery revealed a compact, circular system with enhanced radial outflow and flaring convection in the northwest quadrant,[17] leading both the JMA and JTWC to upgrade it to a minimal typhoon the next day as it moved across the Ryukyu Islands;[18][19] meanwhile, Bebinca developed a ragged eye feature and maintained a symmetrical and impressive CDO over the past six hours.[20] The JMA reported that Bebinca reached its peak intensity at 00:00 UTC on September 15 with 10-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 965\u00a0hPa (28.50\u00a0inHg),[21] before eventually peaking at Category 1-equivalent intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale with 1-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[20] On September 16, at around 07:30 CST,[22] Bebinca made landfall in Lingang New City, Shanghai, China,[23] becoming the strongest typhoon to hit the area since Typhoon Gloria in 1949,[24][25] with a microwave eye feature spanning 29 miles (46\u00a0km) and convective bands extending south-southwestward as it moved west-northwestward under the steering influence of the subtropical high.[26] Shortly after landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system.[27] Inland, Bebinca quickly diminished to a severe tropical storm due to land interaction,[28] with the JMA tracking the system until it was last noted on September 18.[29]"

Thunderstorms were also expected in the rest of Luzon and Metro Manila.[30] PAGASA also predicted that the storm will intensify into a typhoon, bringing flash floods into the country.[31] PAGASA stated that the storm will bring 1.5\u20133.5 metres (1.6\u20133.8 yards) high flash floods to Palawan, Western Visayas, Negros Island Region, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Caraga, Northern Mindanao, Zamboanga Peninsula and the Davao Region. Small waterborne vehicles, like Motor bancas, were advised to take precautionary measures because of the storm.[32] The province of Antique evacuated 545 families because of the storm, suspending classes in all levels. The province provided food packs for the evacuees.[33] The heavy rains brought by the storm-associated trough and southwest monsoon damaged or destroyed nearly 97 homes in the Philippines, displacing over 36,626 people and causing infrastructure damage estimated at \u20b1200,000 (US$4,060.91). In total, 203,197 people were affected, with at least six fatalities, two missing persons, and eleven injuries reported. Additionally, power outages occurred in 18 cities and municipalities, while 40 roads were blocked and six bridges were rendered impassable.[34] All fatalities were caused by falling trees, including four children aboard a tricycle in Malabang, Lanao del Sur and two in the Zamboanga Peninsula.[35] According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, 1,381 individuals were preemptively evacuated, while classes were suspended in 244 areas, including nine municipalities that also ceased work operations.[34] Bebinca also caused \u20b11.09 billion (US$22.13 million) in agricultural damage and affected 24,247 hectares of farmland.[36]"

Pulasan developed over the Philippine Sea  as a tropical depression on September 15 and strengthened into the fourteenth named storm of the annual typhoon season the following day. After gaining organization, the system rapidly developed and reached its peak intensity with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) and a central pressure of 992 hPa (29.29 inHg). Pulasan then turned northwestward, eventually moving across Okinawa Island and making landfall in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, followed by a second landfall in Shanghai, just days after Typhoon Bebinca affected the Shanghai area on September 19. As the storm moved overland, it maintained a well-defined circulation center; however, it gradually turned northeastward under the influence of prevailing mid-latitude westerlies. Pulasan reemerged over the East China Sea, just off the coast of China, showcasing a large, near-symmetric area of deep convection to the southeast on September 20. By 06:00 UTC on September 21, Pulasan had transitioned into an extratropical low as it moved east-northeastward and became embedded within the polar front jet to the north, passing over southern South Korea. The extratropical storm entered the Sea of Japan on September 22, crossed the T\u014dhoku region, and then emerged into the Pacific Ocean while being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of Pulasan were last noted by the  Japan Meteorological Agency on September 24 near the International Dateline; however, the Ocean Prediction Center indicated that these remnants crossed the International Dateline and entered the Central North Pacific Ocean late on September 25. Afterward, the remnants gradually approached the coast of British Columbia, making landfall on September 27 and dissipating after moving inland the same day. In China, the Yangjiazhai meteorological station in Fengxian District  and the Nicheng Park meteorological station in Pudong District both recorded more than 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rainfall within a six-hour period, breaking historical records for each district since meteorological observations began. Xinhua reported that the city evacuated 112,000 people and suspended some ferry and train services. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration noted that the southwest monsoon, enhanced by Soulik and Pulasan, would bring strong to gale-force winds across the Philippines. Heavy rains caused by Pulasan triggered widespread landslides and flooding in the Noto Peninsula, causing extensive damage that was exacerbated by the 2024 Noto earthquake, which devastated the region in January. In South Korea, the cities of Changwon, Yeosu and Busan recorded 519.2\u00a0mm (20.44\u00a0in), 399.5\u00a0mm (15.73\u00a0in) and 390.2\u00a0mm (15.36\u00a0in) of rainfall, respectively, on September 21. The remnants of Tropical Storm Pulasan caused 15,000 customers to lose power, primarily on Vancouver Island, especially in Campbell River and Courtenay. In total, the tropical storm caused at least twelve deaths, two injuries, and left twelve people missing."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Pulasan emerged from an area of atmospheric convection 196\u00a0km (122\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Andersen Air Force Base, Guam on September 14.[1] Satellite imagery indicates a broad, elongated area of circulation obscured by flaring and disorganized deep convection, with the disturbance situated in a favorable environment for development.[1] At 00:00 UTC on September 15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a low-pressure area, having previously identified it as a tropical depression.[2][3] The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, noting that the system was disorganized, deep, fragmented, and had flaring convection obscuring the low-level circulation.[4] Shortly after, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Pulasan by the JMA.[5] Pulasan was characterized by a large cyclonic circulation exceeding 690 miles (1,111\u00a0km) and extensive gale-force winds, leading the JTWC to classify it as a monsoon depression at 06:00 UTC on September 16,[6] before later upgrading it to a tropical storm and designating it as 15W.[7] Pulasan was progressing north-northeastward along the northwestern edge of a mid-level subtropical high, with a band of enhanced winds encircling the eastern edge, accompanied by deep convection,[8] while the center stayed clear and was supplied with dry air from a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell to the west.[9] By 11:00 PHT (03:00 UTC) on September 17, Pulasan had entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and was subsequently named Helen by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).[10] The JMA reported that Pulasan reached its peak intensity at 06:00 UTC, with 10-minute sustained winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph)  and a central pressure of 992\u00a0hPa (29.29\u00a0inHg),[11] before ultimately peaking with 1-minute sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[12] Pulasan's low-level circulation has remained broad and somewhat exposed,[13] as dry air continues to encircle its southern side while the system moves northwestward along the southwestern edge of a mid-level subtropical high.[14] Pulasan exited the PAR on September 18 while traversing Okinawa Island in Japan's Ryukyu Archipelago as its circulation center strengthened with persistent convection,[15] and satellite imagery displayed flaring convection along with weak easterly outflow over the East China Sea.[16][17]  On September 19, Pulasan made landfall in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, followed by a second landfall in Shanghai, just days after Typhoon Bebinca affected the Shanghai area.[18][19] As the storm moved overland, it maintained a well-defined circulation center;[20] however, the system gradually turned northeastward under the influence of mid-latitude prevailing westerlies.[21] Pulasan reemerged over the East China Sea, just off the coast of Jiangsu, China, showcasing a large, near-symmetric area of deep convection to the southeast on September 20.[22] Meanwhile, satellite imagery and surface reports from Jeju Island indicated that it was in the earliest phase of extratropical transition, with vigorous deep convection occurring over the southern semicircle.[23] By 06:00 UTC on September 21, the JMA reported that Pulasan had transitioned into an extratropical low as it moved east-northeastward and became embedded within the polar front jet to the north,[24] passing over southern South Korea.[25] The JTWC then ceased issuing advisories on the system as it underwent frontogenesis while entering the baroclinic zone.[26] The extratropical storm entered the Sea of Japan on September 22, crossed the T\u014dhoku region, and then emerged into the Pacific Ocean while being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone.[27] The extratropical remnants of Pulasan were last noted by the JMA on September 24 near the International Dateline;[28] however, the Ocean Prediction Center indicated that these remnants crossed the International Dateline and entered the Central North Pacific Ocean late on September 25.[29] The remnants gradually approached the coast of British Columbia,[30] making landfall on September 27,[31] moving inland,[32] and dissipating the same day.[33]"

In Noto, one person was missing and two others were critically injured after a landslide struck their home. At least twelve rivers across Ishikawa overflowed, and 6,500 households were left without power in the prefecture, according to Hokuriku Electric Power Company.[39] At least 903 people from 581 households were evacuated across six provinces in South Korea.[44] In South Korea, the cities of Changwon, Yeosu and Busan recorded 519.2\u00a0mm (20.44\u00a0in), 399.5\u00a0mm (15.73\u00a0in) and 390.2\u00a0mm (15.36\u00a0in) of rainfall respectively on September 21. Flooding affected 83 sections of public roads, leading to 18 incidents of soil loss and a wall collapse, 30 private facilities and 27 houses. Two trucks fell into a sinkhole in Busan.[44] In Yangju city, Gyeonggi province, an elderly man died after being swept away by a torrent.[45] A total of 27 private homes were flooded, affecting almost 30 private businesses, including shops and factories. Moreover, 641 areas within 22 national parks throughout the country were still unreachable.[46] The remnants of Tropical Storm Pulasan have caused wind warnings for several areas in British Columbia, including the B.C. Coast, sections of Vancouver Island, the Central Coast, and Haida Gwaii,[47] while approximately 15,000 customers lost power, primarily on Vancouver Island, especially in Campbell River and Courtenay.[48]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Soulik, known in the Philippines as Tropical Depression Gener, was a weak tropical cyclone that impacted both the Philippines and Vietnam. It formed as the fifteenth named storm of the annual typhoon season in September 2024, Soulik originated from a low-pressure area to the east-northeast of Manila, Philippines on September 14, when it was designated as tropical depression Gener due to its formation within the Philippine Area of Responsibility on September 16. The system gradually shifted westward along the southern edge of a mid-level subtropical high, making landfall in Palanan, Isabela, on September 17. As it traveled further into Luzon, it weakened while encountering the rugged terrain of the Cordillera Central. After emerging over the South China Sea on the next day, the system displayed a broad, disorganized low-level circulation. Although two disturbances in the South China Sea were initially expected to merge closer to Vietnam, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered merging these disturbances into one system. Early the next day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm named Soulik by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Soulik made landfall near Quang Binh and Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb, Vietnam, at around 2 p.m. local time. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression due to land interaction, and the JMA continued to monitor the system until it dissipated on September 20. The combined effects of Soulik, the southwest monsoon, and Typhoons Bebinca, Pulasan, and Igme have resulted in at least 26 fatalities, 18 injuries, and three missing persons in the Philippines, with total damages amounting to \u20b11.11 billion (US$22.63 million); in Vietnam, heavy rains from Soulik have led to three deaths and one injury, while in Thailand, officials in Nakhon Phanom have swiftly initiated water pumping operations into the Mekong River due to heavy rainfall, and the Meteorology and Hydrology Department has reported that the remnants of Soulik and associated wind waves are affecting the southeastern areas of Myanmar."

        "content": "The origins of Tropical Storm Soulik can be traced back to September 14, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed approximately 596\u00a0km (371\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Manila, Philippines.[1][2] At 00:00 UTC on September 15, the JMA identified the system as a tropical depression, featuring a defined, partially exposed low-level circulation and persistent deep convection over the southwest quadrant.[3][4] At 13:00 UTC on September 16, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), indicating that upper-level conditions were marginal, with low to moderate vertical wind shear and weak outflow aloft.[5] On that same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced that the system had developed into a tropical depression and named Gener, as it formed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[6] The system was gradually shifting westward along the southern edge of a mid-level subtropical high, and at 23:00 PHT (15:00 UTC) on September 16, the storm made landfall in Palanan, Isabela.[7][8] The tropical depression traveled further into Luzon and weakened as it encountered the rugged terrain of the Cordillera Central.[9] As it emerged over the South China Sea at 14:00 PHT (06:00 UTC) on the next day, the system displayed a broad disorganized low-level circulation.[10][11] The depresion had conditions that were conducive to tropical cyclogenesis, featuring warm sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F) and low vertical wind shear.[12] On September 18, the JTWC canceled their TCFA due to an obscured low-level circulation with flaring convection, while the depression had drifted into an area of moderate vertical wind shear.[13] Earlier, two disturbances in the South China Sea near 98W and 99W were expected to merge and strengthen at 98W, closer to Vietnam, and shortly after, the system was classified as tropical depression 16W, showing rapidly consolidating deep convection that has organized significantly over the past six hours.[14] However, the JTWC was considering the merging of two disturbances in the South China Sea into one system.[15] Early the following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm named Soulik, according to the JMA, while heading towards the northern coast of Vietnam, though it was gradually weakening,[16] with peak 10-minute sustained winds estimated at 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 992\u00a0hPa (29.29\u00a0inHg).[17] Soulik made landfall in V\u0129nh Linh District, Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb, Vietnam, at around 2 p.m. local time that day,[18] after which the JTWC discontinued warnings for the system.[19] Soulik quickly weakened to a tropical depression due to land interaction,[20] and the JMA continued to monitor the system until it dissipated on September 20.[21]"

It formed from the Intertropical Convergence Zone and moved over Mozambique, After moving open waters, the system began organizing on January\u00a014, becoming Tropical Storm Chedza two days later. It quickly intensified over the Mozambique Channel due to warm waters and favorable conditions, and the storm attained peak 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) on January\u00a016. That day, Chedza moved ashore western Madagascar between Belo sur Mer and Morondava, and it quickly crossed the island while weakening. The storm briefly re-intensified, passing southwest of R\u00e9union before turning to the southeast. Chedza became extratropical on January\u00a019, and was last noted two days later. The formative stages of Chedza brought rainfall to an already flooded region across southeastern Africa. Weeks of heavy rainfall killed 117\u00a0people in Mozambique and 104 in neighboring Malawi, where it was the worst floods in 24\u00a0years. In Madagascar, Chedza struck after weeks of heavy rainfall, causing rivers to increase and flooding widespread areas of crop fields. In the capital city of Antananarivo, the deluge damaged the main water pump that controlled water levels in the region. The rainfall caused mudslides and damaged roads. Across the country, flooding from Chedza displaced 54,792\u00a0people, after destroying 4,430\u00a0houses and flooding another 3,442, mostly in Vatovavy-Fitovinany in the southeastern portion. Chedza killed 80\u00a0people and caused about $40\u00a0million in damage (2015\u00a0USD). Later, the storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the mountainous peaks of R\u00e9union."

        "content": "An area of convection, or thunderstorms, developed on January\u00a09 within the Intertropical Convergence Zone between the coast of Mozambique and the Mozambique Channel, while moving generally southward.[2] It originated from the same monsoon trough that spawned the powerful Cyclone Bansi.[3] A broad circulation formed within the system on January\u00a012 along the coast of Mozambique,[4] aided by good outflow to the south. Warm sea surface temperatures favored development, although it was located within an area of moderate to high wind shear.[5] On January\u00a014, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR) office on R\u00e9union[nb 2] began monitoring the system, labeling it Zone of Disturbed Weather 6 about 170\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Pebane, Mozambique.[7] A ridge to the north steered the system to the east-southeast. Convection continued to pulse around the system, some of the thunderstorms far from the center,[7] and there were several circulations. The system quickly organized into Tropical Disturbance\u00a06 by 12:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a014 as conditions became more favorable.[8] The thunderstorms continued to fluctuate, exposing the circulation briefly,[9] before the system became much better organized on January\u00a015.[10] Later that day, the disturbance intensified into Tropical Depression\u00a06,[11] and at 00:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a016, the MFR upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Chedza.[12] At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] began tracking the system as Tropical Cyclone 05S.[14] Despite having intensified into a tropical storm, Chedza initially resembled a monsoon depression. However, strengthening was expected due to low wind shear and the warm waters.[15] The storm quickly intensified while approaching western Madagascar, and the MFR upgraded it to a severe tropical storm with peak 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[16] The convection wrapped into the circulation more as the circulation consolidated and became more defined, prompting the JTWC to estimate peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[17] Before 18:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a016, Chedza moved ashore in western Madagascar between Belo sur Mer and Morondava, and it quickly weakened to tropical depression status over land.[18] At around 10:00\u00a0UTC on February\u00a017, Chedza emerged over open waters.[19] By that time, the circulation was slightly exposed with the bulk of the convection along the southern periphery.[20] Later on January\u00a017, Chedza organized and re-intensified into a tropical storm.[21] By contrast, the JTWC ceased issuing advisories on January\u00a018, noting that the storm was dissipating due to increased wind shear.[22] Chedza turned to the southeast toward a trough and continued strengthening. Although the MFR described the structure as \"unconventional\", the agency estimated a secondary peak of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[23] On January\u00a019, the convection became far removed from the center as wind shear increased, and Chedza transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone as it began becoming extratropical.[24] The MFR issued their last advisory on the storm on January\u00a020,[25] and they last noted the storm on the following day moving southward.[26]"

        "content": "In its formative stages, Chedza moved over Mozambique on January\u00a014,[4][27] producing flooding in the country as well as neighboring Malawi and Zimbabwe.[28] In Malawi, the formative stages of Chedza brought heavy rainfall that caused deadly floods,[27] following two weeks of precipitation. Widespread flooding covered homes and farmlands in the country's southern portion.[29] At least 260,000\u00a0people were left homeless, and there were 176\u00a0fatalities. The Malawian government requested $430\u00a0million in international aid to cope with flood recovery.[27] It was the worst flooding in Malawi in 24\u00a0years,[29] when floods in 1991 caused $24\u00a0million in damage (1991\u00a0USD).[27] When the precursor to Chedza moved over Mozambique, heavy rainfall caused deadly floods that killed 120\u00a0people.[27][30] In western Madagascar, Morondava reported 10\u00a0minute winds of 99\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) while Chedza was making landfall. Ahead of the storm, the MFR anticipated a storm surge of 1 to 2\u00a0m (3.3 to 6.6\u00a0ft) along the coast.[16] The storm struck after Madagascar was experiencing several weeks of heavy rainfall, with river levels already increased.[31] By early February, much of the country had received twice its average rainfall for the time period.[32] After the storm moved through the region, the Ikopa River reached 4.65\u00a0m (15.3\u00a0ft) at Bevomanga, above the alert stage of 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft).[33] The river fell below alert stage by January\u00a021.[34] The Sisaony River at Ampitatafika reached 1.04\u00a0m (3.4\u00a0ft).[33] High rains damaged the water pump station in Antananarivo, which controlled water levels in the city; this caused increased flooding and damage along nearby rivers.[35] Across the country, flooding from Chedza displaced another 54,792\u00a0people,[36] after destroying 4,430\u00a0houses and flooding another 3,442, mostly in Vatovavy-Fitovinany.[36] Chedza damaged or flooded 969\u00a0classrooms, disrupting the education of 48,000\u00a0students. The storm also damaged 44\u00a0health centers and eight district hospitals,[37] with 80 administrative buildings impacted.[38] The floods inundated 9,922\u00a0ha (24,520 acres) of fields,[35] including 8,494\u00a0ha (20,990 acres) of damaged rice fields, left 1,226\u00a0heads of cattle missing.[36] The storm also damaged 42\u00a0roads and six bridges,[36] and one dam was damaged.[39] Throughout the country, Chedza killed 80\u00a0people,[40] many of whom killed by landslides,[41] and damage was estimated at over 100\u00a0billion ariary (US$40\u00a0million).[28] Late in its duration, Chedza spread a plume of moisture across R\u00e9union over three days. Salazie in the mountainous center portion of the island recorded 270\u00a0mm (11\u00a0in), including 118\u00a0mm (4.6\u00a0in) in just 12\u00a0hours. During the storm's passage to the southwest, Chedza produced peak wind gusts of 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) at G\u00eete de Bellecombe. The storm also caused high waves along R\u00e9union's west coast, with peak wave of 6.8\u00a0m (22\u00a0ft).[3]"

        "content": " The 2016 Pacific typhoon season is considered to have been the fourth-latest start for a Pacific typhoon season since reliable records began. It was an average season, with a total of 26 named storms, 13 typhoons, and six super typhoons. The season ran throughout 2016, though typically most tropical cyclones develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Nepartak, developed on July 3, while the season's last named storm, Nock-ten, dissipated on December 28. The development of Nepartak made the second-latest time within a season for the first named storm to develop and ended a 199-day period (from December 17, 2015 \u2013 July 3, 2016) during which no named storm was active in the basin. Tropical Storm Mirinae reached peak intensity while making landfall over the Red River Delta, causing very severe damage in Northern Vietnam. By the end of August, three storms had hit the Japanese island of Hokkaid\u014d, the most since 1951. In September, Typhoon Meranti reached peak intensity with a minimum pressure of 890 hPa, becoming one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record. Typhoon Chaba became the strongest typhoon to strike South Korea since 2012. Tropical Storm Aere and a tropical depression brought the worst flooding in Vietnam since 2011. The last storm of the season, Typhoon Nock-ten, became the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide on Christmas Day (December 25) since at least 1960, in terms of 1-minute maximum sustained winds. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100\u00b0E and 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA)[nb 2] will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\u00a0(PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) located between 135\u00b0E and 115\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N\u201325\u00b0N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC)[nb 3][nb 1] are given a number with a \"W\" suffix."

        "header": "Seasonal forecasts",
        "content": "During the year several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies included the Tropical Storm Risk\u00a0(TSR) Consortium of University College London, PAGASA and Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. Some of the forecasts took into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the El Ni\u00f1o conditions that were observed during the previous year. The first forecast of the year was released by PAGASA during January 2016, within its seasonal climate outlook for the period January\u00a0\u2013 June.[6] The outlook noted that one to two tropical cyclones were expected between January and March, while one to three were expected to develop or enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility between April and June.[6] During March the Hong Kong Observatory predicted that the typhoon season in Hong Kong would be near-normal, with four to seven tropical cyclones passing within 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) of the territory compared to an average of six,[10] which was revised to five to eight tropical cyclones in August. On May 7, Tropical Storm Risk issued its first forecast for the season and predicted that it will be a quiet season, with 22 tropical storms, 13 typhoons, and 6 intense typhoons developing during the year, while an ACE Index of 217 was also forecast.[3] Ahead of the Thailand rainy season starting during May, the Thai Meteorological Department predicted that two tropical cyclones would move near Thailand during 2016.[11] They predicted that there was a high chance that the first tropical cyclone would move past northern and north-eastern Thailand during August or September.[11] The second tropical cyclone was predicted to move past Southern Thailand during October and November.[11] On June 28, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau predicted that between 19 and 23 tropical storms would develop over the basin, while two\u00a0\u2014 four systems were expected to affect Taiwan itself.[7] On July 6, TSR released their second forecast for the season. They predicted mostly the same numbers as the previous forecast, but raised the number of intense typhoons to 7.[4] PAGASA issued their second and final forecast for the year on July 15, within its seasonal climate outlook for the period July\u00a0\u2013 December.[8] The outlook noted that between five and eleven tropical cyclones were expected between July and September, while four to nine were expected to develop or enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility between October and December.[8] TSR issued their final forecast for the season on August 8, sustaining the tropical cyclone numbers, however its ACE was slightly lowered than the previous forecast.[5]"

        "header": "Season summary",
        "content": "Despite the season's late start, the 2016 season was a normal and active season with a total of 53 tropical depressions, of which 26 became tropical storms. After five months of inactivity, the first tropical depression developed on May 26, making it the fifth-latest season for a system to form. According to existing records only four other seasons started later\u2014the 1973, 1983, 1984, and 1998 seasons. Tropical activity throughout the basin became marginally favorable for development, and two tropical depressions developed during June. On July 3, Nepartak became the first named tropical storm, making it the second-latest first named storm on record. Nepartak's naming ended a 199-day period (from December 17, 2015, to July 2, 2016) during which no named storm was active within the basin; this period tied the 199-day period from December 22, 1997, to July 8, 1998.[12] Nepartak reached Category 5 super typhoon intensity before making landfall in Taiwan and East China, causing a total of US$1.52 billion of damage. In late July, Tropical Storm Mirinae reached its peak intensity while making landfall over Red River Delta in Northern Vietnam. The storm caused a total of US$334 million of damage[nb 4] in Hainan and Vietnam. Later, Nida reached near typhoon strength; it affected the Philippines, South China and Vietnam, but its damage was lower than that of Mirinae. The season became more active in August, with 7 named storms. Except Dianmu, which affected South China, Indochina, all of the tropical cyclones in August affected Japan and the Russian Far East. By the end of August, three storms (Chanthu, Lionrock and Kompasu) had hit the Japanese island of Hokkaid\u014d, the most since 1951.[13] Lionrock was a large, powerful, long-lived and erratic tropical cyclone which caused significant flooding and casualties in North Korea and Japan in late August. In September, Typhoon Meranti became the strongest typhoon in terms of pressure since Typhoon Megi in 2010, as well as the strongest typhoon in terms of sustained winds since Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and the second-strongest tropical cyclone worldwide in 2016, only behind Cyclone Winston, in terms of pressure. Typhoon Megi reached its peak intensity as a Category 3 typhoon while making landfall over Taiwan. Both Meranti and Megi made landfall in  Fujian, China, and they caused a total of US$3.6 billion of damage. Rai became a weak tropical storm before it made landfall in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand in mid-September, causing flooding and moderate damage. Typhoon Malakas impacted Japan with a total of nearly $740 million of damage as a Category 4 typhoon. In late September and early October, Typhoon Chaba reached Category 5 super typhoon intensity and became the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in South Korea since Sanba in 2012. Chaba also caused 7 deaths in the country.[14] A tropical depression formed east of the International Date Line on October 3, and entered the basin before developing into Typhoon Songda. Songda struck the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada as a powerful extratropical cyclone.[15] Severe Tropical Storm Aere affected parts of Southeast Asia in mid-October, including the worst flooding in Vietnam since 2010, causing a total of US$209\u00a0million of damage.[16][17] Later, Typhoon Sarika became a powerful typhoon, and affected the Philippines, China and Vietnam, causing severe damage as well as severe flooding in southern China. After Sarika, Typhoon Haima reached Category 5 super typhoon strength before impacting the Philippines and China, causing a total of US$1.93 billion in damages. Haima was the most severe tropical cyclone to affect Hong Kong in October since 1995. In early November, a tropical depression made landfall in Southern Vietnam and caused heavy flooding throughout central and southern Vietnam, causing moderate damage. In late December, Nock-ten became the strongest Christmas tropical cyclone on record anywhere in the world since at least 1960 in terms of 1-minute sustained winds, before impacting the Philippines.[18][19] The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 2016 Pacific typhoon season as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center was 261.9\u00a0units.[20] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 miles per hour (63\u00a0km/h)."

The JTWC considered the system to be subtropical at this time, as its structure was asymmetric, with deep convection displaced to the north and east of the system's low level circulation centre.[121] From late August 20 to early August 22, the system had at least somewhat an interaction with Mindulle, taking an erratic and slow path for a bit. Restrengthening begun again quickly, with the system already starting to develop an eye in mid-August 23. In the middle of the 24th of August the system reached an initial peak as a Category 3-equivalent storm. Lionrock entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on August 25, 2016, and PAGASA assigned Dindo [122] as the local name, while Lionrock had begun an eyewall replacement cycle early that day, weakening to a Category 2-equivalent storm. After two days, early on August 26, it finally completed the eyewall replacement cycle, but slow restrengthening occurred. Another two days passed until it reached its full peak as a Category 4-equivalent storm, which rapid weakening ensued after.

Early on October 15, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was assigned the name Haima.[285] At this point of time, Haima was located in a very favorable environment with very high ocean heat content, very low wind shear and warm SSTs.[286] Three hours later, Haima intensified into a severe tropical storm.[287] With very good radial outflow, and still being situated in an extremely favorable environment, Haima rapidly intensified into a Category 4 super typhoon. By the end of the time, PAGASA announced the Haima had entered their area of responsibility, assigning it the name Lawin. Haima continued to intensify, reaching Category 5 super typhoon status by late on October 18.[citation needed] Super Typhoon Haima (Lawin) intensified further. PAGASA used the term \"super typhoon\" on Haima for the first time since it was introduced in May 2015 due to Typhoon Haiyan's ravage during 2013. PAGASA also raised Signal #5 in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela, which made it a hazardous storm. Due to land interaction, Typhoon Haima weakened into a Category 4 storm and made landfall in Pe\u00f1ablanca, Cagayan. Typhoon Haima weakened after landfall in the Philippines and landed in Hong Kong as a weakened Category 1 storm, in which Signal no. 8 was raised. By October 22, Haima became extratropical and dissipated on October 26. Total damages in the Philippines were at \u20b13.74 billion (US$77.6 million).[288]"

At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 76,782.[3] Shrewsbury has Anglo-Saxon roots and institutions whose foundations dating from that time represent a cultural continuity possibly going back as far as the 8th century.[4][5] The centre has a largely undisturbed medieval street plan and over 660 listed buildings,[6] including several examples of timber framing from the 15th and 16th centuries. Shrewsbury Castle, a red sandstone  fortification, and Shrewsbury Abbey, were founded in 1074 and 1083 respectively by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Roger de Montgomery.[7] The town is the birthplace of Charles Darwin.[8] It has had a role in nurturing aspects of English culture, including drama,[9] ballet, dance[10] and pantomime.[10] Located 9 miles (14\u00a0km) east of the England\u2013Wales border, Shrewsbury serves as the commercial centre for Shropshire and parts of mid-Wales, with a retail output of over \u00a3299 million per year and light industry and distribution centres, such as Battlefield Enterprise Park, on the outskirts.

There is a tradition that the town was \"founded in the 5th century, on occasion of the decay of the Roman Uriconium.\" Historian John Wacher suggests that Shrewsbury may have been refortified by refugees fleeing an outbreak of a plague in Viroconium around this time.[24] It is claimed that Pengwern, sometime capital of the Kingdom of Powis (itself established by the 440s), was at Shrewsbury.[25] The first attested association of Pengwern with Shrewsbury is mentioned by Giraldus Cambrensis in the 12th century. Alternative suggestions as to the location of Pengwern include Whittington Castle near Oswestry,[26] and Berth, a hillfort near Baschurch. The Historia Divae Monacellae, composed in the 14th or 15th century, says that Brochwel Ysgithrog, the 6th-century king of Powis, had a palace at Shrewsbury that became the site of the foundation of St Chad.[27]"

Viking raiders from the north were reaching as far south as Bridgnorth by 910.[36] In the early 10th century, the relics of St Alkmund were translated to the town from Derby, this was probably the work of \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d.[37] (Later, after St Alkmund's Church  became the property of Lilleshall Abbey in about 1145, the relics were retranslated back to Derby.)[38]"

He built at Shrewsbury Castle in 1074,[7] though archaeological excavations at the site of Shrewsbury castle in 2019 have indicated that the location may have been a fortified site in the time of the Anglo-Saxons.[39] He also founded Shrewsbury Abbey as a Benedictine monastery in 1083.[40] The town's position just off Watling Street placed it within the Forest of Arden, a thickly wooded area, unpenetrated by Roman roads and somewhat dangerous in medieval times, so that travellers would pray at Coughton before entering.[41] In 1102, Robert of Bell\u00eame, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury was deposed and the title forfeited, as a consequence of him rebelling against Henry I and joining the Duke of Normandy's invasion of England in 1101. William Pantulf, Lord of Wem, assisted Henry in putting down the rebellion. To deal with the thickly wooded local forests, ideal for the concealment of archers, Pantulf brought in 6,000 foot soldiers to cut down trees and open up the roads.[42][12]  Henry subsequently took the government of the town into his own hands and in 1116 the nobility of England did homage to William \u00c6theling, Henry\u2019s son, at Shrewsbury, and swore allegiance to his father.[43]  The early death of William \u00c6theling without issue led to the succession crisis, known in history as the Anarchy, and during this period, in 1138, King Stephen successfully besieged the town's castle held by William FitzAlan for the Empress Maud.[44] In 1138 the relics of St Winifred were brought to Shrewsbury from Gwytheryn,[45] following their purchase by the Abbot of Shrewsbury, the abbey being ready for consecration but having no relics prior to that time.[46]  The popularity of St Winifred grew in the 14th and 15th centuries and a new shrine for her relics was built in the late 1300s.  Around this time the abbey illegally acquired the relics of St Beuno, uncle of St Winifred, by stealing them. As a result the abbey was fined but allowed to keep the relics[47] From 1155, during the reign of Henry II, there was a leper hospital dedicated to St Giles and associated with Shrewsbury Abbey. From the 1220s, there was also a general hospital dedicated to St John the Baptist.[48] In January 1234 Prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth of Wales and Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke burned down the town and laid siege to its castle.[49] In 1283, Edward I summoned a parliament in Shrewsbury, later adjourned to Acton Burnell,[50] to try and condemn Dafydd ap Gruffydd, last of the native Princes of Wales, to execution by hanging, drawing and quartering within the town after Dafydd was captured, ending his rebellion against the king.[51]  It is thought this parliament met in the Abbey.[30]"

The damage was so considerable that Richard II remitted the town's taxes for three years towards the repairs.[30] In 1398, Richard summoned a Great Parliament in the town, which is believed to have met in the Abbey.[30] In 1403 the Battle of Shrewsbury was fought at Battlefield, a few miles north of the town centre, between King Henry IV and Henry Percy (Hotspur), with the king emerging victorious.[54] Hotspur's body was taken by Thomas Neville, to Whitchurch, for burial. However, when rumours circulated that Percy was still alive, the king \"had the corpse exhumed and displayed it, propped upright between two millstones, in the market place at Shrewsbury\".[55] That being done, Percy was subjected to posthumous execution.[56] One of the Princes in the Tower, Richard of Shrewsbury, was born in the town around 17 August 1473,[57] the second son of King Edward IV of England and Elizabeth Woodville. In 1480, Edward V, then Prince of Wales (and the other prince of the Princes in the Tower), was resident in Shrewsbury. On 11 May Edward V confirmed the composition of the town's Mercer's Company, which had merged with the guilds of the Ironmongers and Goldsmiths. This fraternity were patrons of the Altar of St Michael in St Chad's Church and they kept a Mercers Hall on the site of the Sextry of Old St Chads.[30] In 1485, ahead of the Battle of Bosworth Field, Henry Tudor, while not yet king, marched his forces on a route that lay through Shrewsbury. He was initially denied access to the town, but on intervention by a member of the Stanley family he was admitted.[58][59]  Thomas Mytton, the Bailiff of the town, a supporter of Richard III, had vowed that the only way he would get through was \"over his dead body\". Thomas then lay down and allowed Henry to step over him, to free himself from his oath.[60] Henry was accommodated in the building now known as Henry Tudor House on Wyle Cop.[61] In 1490, Henry VII, accompanied by his queen and his son, Prince Arthur, celebrated the feast of St George in the town.[30] The town is recorded as having entertained Henry again in 1496, with attendants lodged in the Sextry of Old St Chads;[30] more generally it is said of Henry VII's relations with the town that: The intercourse which had begun thus favourably was kept up in after years by Henry, who, with his queen and son, frequently visited this town, upon which occasions they were feasted by the Bailiffs in a most royal and hospitable manner.[30]"

St Giles's leper hospital passed to the Prince family, who were succeeded by their descendants the Earls of Tankerville.

Members of this council included John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, Sir Henry Sidney, William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and Sir Rowland Hill, publisher of the Geneva Bible and potential inspiration for a hero in Shakespeare's As You Like It.[64] Its functions were interpreted widely. It was to hear all suits, civil and criminal, which were brought by individuals too poor to sue at common law; it was to try all cases of murder, felony, piracy, wrecking and such crimes as were likely to disturb the peace; it was to investigate charges of misgovernment by officials and the false verdicts of juries; it was to enforce the laws against livery and maintenance, to punish rumour mongers and adulterers, and to deal with disputes concerning enclosures, villein service and manorial questions; it heard appeals from the common law courts; and it was responsible for administering the legislation dealing with religion.[65] According to historian John Davies, at its peak in the mid-16th century, the Council: represented a remarkable experiment in regional government. It administered the law cheaply and rapidly; it dealt with up to twenty cases a day and George Owen stated that the 'oppressed poor' flocked to it.[66] In 1551 there was a notable outbreak of sweating sickness in the town, which Dr John Caius was in the town to attend to at the command of the council.[67] The following year, after his return to London, Caius published A Boke or Counseill Against the Disease Commonly Called the Sweate, or Sweatyng Sicknesse.  The president of the council was the dedicatee of the book and the dedicatory epistle explains his appointment. This text became the main source of knowledge of this disease, now understood to be influenza.[68] In 1581, Sir Henry Sidney, celebrated the feast of St George, on 23 April, in this town, with great splendour:\u00a0a solemn procession went from the Council House to St Chad\u2019s Church, the choir of which was fitted up in imitation of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle with the stalls decorated with the arms of the Knights of the Garter; on the conclusion of divine service Sir Henry devoted the afternoon to feasting the burgesses.[30]"

It was in this period that Edward VI gave permission for the foundation of a free school, which was later to become Shrewsbury School.[71] Later, William Camden, in his Britannia (begun 1577), remarked of the town that \"Shrewsbury is inhabited both by Welsh and English, who speak each other's language; and among other things greatly to their praise is the grammar school founded by them, the best filled in all England, whose flourishing state is owing to provision made by its head master, the excellent and worthy Thomas Ashton\", the school's first head master.[72]"

A town hall was built in the Market Place on the site of an ancient guildhall in 1730;[81] it was demolished and a new combined guildhall and shirehall was erected on the site in 1837.[82] Local soldier and statesman Robert Clive served as the town's mayor in 1762 and was Shrewsbury's MP from 1762 until his death in 1774.[83] St Chad's Church collapsed in 1788 after attempts to expand the crypt compromised the structural integrity of the tower above. Now known as Old St Chad's, the remains of the church building and its churchyard are on the corner of Princess Street, College Hill and Belmont. A new St Chad's Church was built just four years after the collapse, but as a large neo-classical round church and in a different and more elevated location, at the top of Claremont Hill close to the Quarry.[33] In the Industrial Revolution the Shrewsbury Canal opened in 1797, initially connecting the town  to Trench. By 1835 it had been linked up to the Shropshire Canal and thence to the rest of the canal network.[84] In the period directly after Napoleon's surrender after the Battle of Waterloo, the town's own 53rd (Shropshire) Regiment of Foot was sent to guard him in his exile on St Helena. A locket containing a lock of the emperor's hair, presented to an officer of the 53rd, remains to this day in the collections of the Soldiers of Shropshire Museum at Shrewsbury Castle.[85] HM Prison Shrewsbury, when new in the Georgian period, was considered a national example of improved conditions and more enlightened penal policy. Times change and a 2005 report on prison population found that it was the most overcrowded in England and Wales, despite a major expansion in Victorian times.[86] The prison, which was also known as the Dana because it was built near the site of the medieval Dana gaol, was closed in 2013 and then sold by the Ministry of Justice to private property developers in 2014.[87] In 1821, the county purchased a building in College Hill which was adapted to become the judge's lodgings, providing accommodation for the judges and their retinue during their attendance at the Assizes.[30]"

However, some historic buildings were demolished to make way for the brutalist architectural style of the 1960s, though the town was saved from a new inner ring road due to its challenging geography.[89] A notable example of 1960s/70s construction in Shrewsbury was Telecom House on Smithfield Road, demolished in the 2000s.[90] Between 1962 and 1992 there was a hardened nuclear bunker, built for No 16 Group Royal Observer Corps Shrewsbury, who provided the field force of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would have sounded the four-minute warning alarm in the event of war and warned the population of Shrewsbury in the event of approaching radioactive fallout.[91] The building was staffed by up to 120 volunteers who trained on a weekly basis. After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989, the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995. However, the nuclear bunker still stands just inside Holywell Street near the Abbey as a lasting reminder of the Cold War, but is now converted and used as a veterinary practice.[92] The town was targeted by the IRA in 1992. One bomb was detonated at Shrewsbury Castle, causing severe damage to the regimental museum of the Shropshire Light Infantry,[93] estimated to be in the region of \u00a3250,000 and many artefacts were lost. A second bomb, detonated in the Darwin Shopping Centre, was put out by the sprinkler system before any major damage was caused. Finally, a third bomb was discovered elsewhere in the town centre but failed to do any serious damage.[94] From the late 1990s, the town experienced severe flooding problems from the Severn and Rea Brook. In the autumn of 2000 large swathes of the town were underwater, notably Frankwell, which flooded three times in six weeks.[95] The Frankwell flood defences were completed in 2003, along with the new offices of Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council. More recently, such as in 2005 and 2007 but not 2020, flooding has been less severe and the defences have generally held back floodwaters from the town centre areas. However, the town car parks are often left to be flooded in the winter, which reduces trade in the town, most evidenced in the run up to Christmas in 2007.[96] Shrewsbury won the West Midlands Capital of Enterprise award in 2004.[97] The town has two large expanding business parks, Shrewsbury Business Park by the A5 in the southeast and Battlefield Enterprise Park in the north. There are many residential developments currently under construction in the town to cater for the increasing numbers of people wishing to live in the town, which is a popular place to commute to Telford, Wolverhampton and Birmingham from.[98] In 2009 Shrewsbury Town Council was formed and the town's traditional coat of arms was returned to everyday use.[99] In 2021 the lost seal of the town, dating from 1425, was discovered.[100]"

There were about 3.1\u00a0million visitors \u2013 both day visitors and staying visitors \u2013 to the borough in 2001, with 88% being day visitors and 12% being staying visitors; staying visitors accounted for 42% of spending.[135] Shrewsbury's position of being the only sizeable town for a large area, especially to the west in Mid-Wales, allows it to attract a large retail base beyond that of its resident population. This is not only evident in the retail sector, but also in the healthcare sector, where the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital has the only A&E department westwards until Aberystwyth, about 75 miles (121\u00a0km) away.[136] Businesses in Shrewsbury voted in favour of a Business Improvement District in late 2013 and Shrewsbury BID started operating in April 2014. Shrewsbury BID delivers on a five-year business plan of projects, which include major destination marketing campaigns, significant cost savings for businesses and strategic work ensuring the best possible town centre environment in which business can flourish. The company is governed by a board of directors and employed three staff full-time in 2017.[137] In terms of social and economic deprivation, according to the Overall Index of Multiple Deprivation of 2004, one Super Output Area (SOA) in the town is in the bottom 15% of all areas nationally. This area is in the ward of Harlescott.[138] A further four SOAs fall into the bottom 30% nationally, these being in the wards of Monkmoor, Sundorne, Battlefield and Heathgates and Meole Brace. The most affluent areas of the town are generally to the south and west, around the grounds of Shrewsbury School and the Copthorne area.[citation needed]"

At the reformation this ceremony was commuted for another, held on the second Monday after Trinity Sunday, which is still continued, though with less pomp and circumstance than formerly. The Companies form themselves into processions, headed severally by men on horseback in gaudy apparel, called kings, probably as representatives of the monarchs who granted their charters* They move in marshalled array to Kingsland, where they are met by the mayor and corporation and the day is spent in festivity.[139] The town's Quarry Park has been the site of cultural activity since before the Reformation: a bank there, cut in the form of an amphitheatre, was used by the friars of the adjacent convent, who performed the ancient religious mystery plays or miracle plays;[30] this continued in the mid-16th century when the plays of Thomas Ashton's Shrewsbury School attracted royal attention.[140] On several occasions the school put on pageants for the visiting Council of Wales and the Marches. In 1581, the Lord President, Sir Henry Sidney, leaving the town by barge, was greeted by several scholars on an island downstream of the castle dressed as green nymphs with willow branches tied to their heads reciting verses across the water.[141] William Shakespeare set the last two acts of his play, Henry IV, Part 1, written around 1596, near the town.[142] It has been suggested, placing reliance on a record of a performance by his company, the King's Men in the town between 1603 and 1605, and supposed familiarity with the landscape; that Shakespeare performed in the town and knew the area.[143] The playwright George Farquhar's 1706 play The Recruiting Officer is set in the town.[144] In the later Renaissance period, the land at Kingsland was devoted to elaborate performances, with grand arbours being built by the various town guilds.[145] Some of the arbours survive, such as that for the Shoemakers Guild.[146] Known as the father of English ballet,[147] as well as the originator of pantomime,[148] John Weaver, developed his art in Shrewsbury. A second generation dancing master in the town,[149] he also wrote on the philosophy, theology, statecraft and biology embedded in his era's understating of dance, which he located in a wider understanding of his culture as representing a component of Ptolemaic harmony and an earnest part of the statecraft of his time.[150]"

In the 19th century, Charles Dickens made three visits to the town. The first, in 1838, was while he was travelling to Wales. On this occasion he stayed at the Lion Hotel. In 1852 he again visited, this time as part of a theatrical tour, staging benefit performances to raise money for the Guild of Literature and Art. His final visit, in 1858, was as part of a nationwide reading tour. Once again he stayed at the Lion.[153] The town appears in the Brother Cadfael novels by Ellis Peters. The novels take Shrewsbury Abbey for their setting and have made medieval Shrewsbury familiar to a wide readership.[154] Shrewsbury was used as the setting for the 1984 television film A Christmas Carol, which filmed many of its interior and exterior shots in and around the town.[153] In early 2017, Shrewsbury BID, The Hive and GRAIN Photography Hub organised an outdoor Magnum Photos exhibition.[155] Inspired by Shrewsbury's links to Charles Darwin, this exhibition considered the theme of evolution through the eyes of international photographers. The 10-week exhibition was free to the public and staged at St Mary's Churchyard and The Square. In 2022, the BBC production of Great Expectations with Olivia Colman and Tom Hardy was filmed in the town.[156] The same year, episodes of The Apprentice and Celebrity Hunted were filmed in Shrewsbury.

They can be small in size for serving several at a time, or large for serving as a dessert in their own right. Traditionally they have a distinct hint of lemon.[196] The playwright William Congreve mentioned Shrewsbury cakes in his play The Way of the World in 1700 as a simile[197] (Witwoud \u2013 \"Why, brother Wilfull of Salop, you may be as short as a Shrewsbury cake, if you please. But I tell you 'tis not modish to know relations in town\"). The recipe is also included in several early cookbooks including The Compleat Cook of 1658.[198] A final reference to the cakes can be seen to this day as the subject of a plaque affixed to a building close to Shrewsbury's town library by the junction of Castle Street and School Gardens. The aforementioned plaque marks the spot where the Shrewsbury Cake's recipe is said to have been pioneered in 1760 by Mr Pailin;[196] a further quote, drawn from Richard Harris Barham's Ingoldby Legends, reads: Oh! Pailin. Prince of Cake Compounders\nThe mouth liquifies at the very name. Shrewsbury is the origin of a popular Simnel cake recipe. Different towns had their own recipes and shapes of the Simnel cake. Bury, Devizes and Shrewsbury produced large numbers to their own recipes, but it is the Bury version that became most well known.[199] The town is alleged to be the origin of Shrewsbury sauce, made from Worcester sauce, red wine and mustard, thickened with flour, which is typically served with lamb. Only known from the 1960s when it appeared in the J. Salmon County Series Cookbooks.[200] Beer brewed in Shrewsbury was celebrated as early as about 1400 when the bard Iolo Goch praised the supply of \"Crwg Amwythig\" dispensed at the Sycharth palace of Owain Glynd\u0175r.[201] In 1900 there were eight breweries in the town, chief among them being Southam's and Trouncer's, which had their own maltings and owned many local public houses, as well as five other maltsters,[202] but the conventional brewing industry gradually closed after takeovers in the 1960s. The last maltings, at Ditherington, closed in 1987.[203] Completed in 1797, these maltings, known as the Ditherington Flax Mill from its original purpose, was the world's first iron-framed building and commonly regarded as \"the grandfather of the skyscraper\". Its importance was recognised in the 1950s, resulting in it becoming a Grade I listed building.[204][205] After the biggest heritage project ever undertaken by Historic England, the building was restored and opened as a museum in 2022.[206] A real ale brewery, The Salopian Brewery, was established in the town in 1995.[207] It was based in the Old Dairy on Mytton Oak Road before relocating in 2014 to Hadnall a few miles north of the town.[208]"

Some of the passages, especially those that pass through buildings from one street to the next, are called \"shuts\" (the word deriving from \"to shoot through\" from one street to another).[209] Many specialist shops, traditional pubs and local restaurants can be found in the hidden corners, squares and lanes of Shrewsbury. Many of the street names have remained unchanged for centuries and there are some more unusual names, such as Longden Coleham, Dogpole, Mardol, Frankwell, Roushill, Grope Lane, Gullet Passage, Murivance, the Dana, Portobello, Bear Steps, Shoplatch and Bellstone.[210] The public library, in the pre-1882 Shrewsbury School building,[211] is on Castle Street. Above the main entrance are two statues bearing the Greek inscriptions \"Philomathes\" and \"Polymathes\". These portray the virtues \"Lover of learning\" and \"Much learning\" to convey the lesson that it is good to gain knowledge through a love of learning.[212] In the centre of the town lies The Quarry. This 29 acres (12\u00a0ha)[213] riverside park attracts thousands of people throughout the year and is enjoyed as a place of recreation. Shrewsbury has traditionally been known as the \"Town of Flowers\", a slogan incorporated into many of the signs on entrance to the town via major roads, although this was replaced in 2007 with \"The birthplace of Charles Darwin\".[8] The British Army's Light Infantry has been associated with Shrewsbury since the 17th century when the first regiments were formed and many more regiments have been raised at Shrewsbury before being deployed all over the world from the American Revolutionary War to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, after several major reorganisations, the Light Infantry now forms part of the regiment known simply as the Rifles. Shrewsbury's Copthorne Barracks, spiritual home of the Light Division, ultimately housed the Headquarters of the British Army's 143 (West Midlands) Brigade before it moved in 2014, while that of the 5th Division disbanded in April 2012 as part of the reorganisation of the Army's Support Command.[214] Another notable feature of the town is Lord Hill's Column, sited outside the Shirehall. At 133\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (40.7\u00a0m) it is the tallest Doric column in England.[215] It was erected as a monument to Rowland Hill commander of II Corps at Waterloo and the man who led the charge against the Imperial Guard towards the end of the battle.[216] The Quantum Leap is an abstract sculpture unveiled in the town centre in 2009 to mark the bicentenary of the birth of Shrewsbury biologist Charles Darwin.[217] Shrewsbury's town centre is almost entirely encircled by the River Severn and there are nine bridges across the river. In addition, there are several that cross the Rea Brook. Working downstream, they are in order: A. E. Housman wrote of the area in A Shropshire Lad, which mentions the bridges of the town in part XXVIII: The Welsh Marches.[224] High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam\nIslanded in Severn stream;\nThe bridges from the steepled crest,\nCross the water east and west."

In 1815, Thomas Telford designed a new coaching route from London to Holyhead in order to improve communications with Ireland. He routed the new road via Shrewsbury, which opened in 1830. The road is now the A5.[235] The road connects the town north-west to Oswestry and east towards Telford, where it joins the M54. The A5 once ran through the town centre, until a bypass was built in the 1930s. Subsequently, in 1992, a 17-mile (27\u00a0km) dual carriageway was completed at a cost of \u00a379 million to the south of the town and was made to form part of the A5 route. This dual carriageway was built further out of the town to act as a substantial link to Telford, as well as a bypass for the town.[236] The A49 goes to Shrewsbury, joining the A5 at the south of the town, coming from Ludlow and Leominster. At this point, the road merges with the A5 for 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km), before separating again to the east of the town. From there it runs north, passing Sundorne, then Battlefield, before heading out towards Whitchurch. At Battlefield, the A53 route begins and heads north-east towards Shawbury and Market Drayton, then onwards towards Newcastle-under-Lyme and Stoke-on-Trent. The A458 (Mallwyd-Quinton) runs through the town centre, entering in the west and leaving to the south-east. The A528 begins in the town centre and heads north, heading for Ellesmere. The A488 begins just west of the town centre in Frankwell and heads out to Bishop's Castle, Clun and Knighton crossing the border in the southwest of Shropshire. Major roads within the town include the A5112, A5191 and A5064. The A5191 goes north\u2013south via the town centre, while the A5112 runs north\u2013south to the east of the town centre. The A5064 is a short, one mile (1.6\u00a0km) stretch of road to the south-east of the town centre, called London Road. Additionally, the A5124, the most recent bypass, was completed in 1998 and runs across the northern edge of the town at Battlefield (connecting the A49/A53 to the A528), though it did exist before as Harlescott Lane (which has since become unclassified). Construction of a major new artery, referred to as the North West Relief Road (NWRR), was granted central government funding in April 2019. Together with the existing A5 and A49 by-passes, the Battlefield Link Road (A5124) and the Oxon Link Road; this will result in the completion of the ring road around the outskirts of the town. Construction is expected to be completed by 2026.[237] The NWRR will involve the construction of a new bridge over the River Severn, upstream from the town centre.[238]"

The town's river and proximity to the countryside inspired his interest in the natural world, while its abundant ice-age boulders sparked his interest in geology.[294]  Classicist Mary Beard, Cambridge professor and television presenter, was educated in Shrewsbury where her father was a prominent architect.[295] Shrewsbury has been home to many contributors to literature. Thomas Churchyard (c.\u20091523\u20131604) son of a farmer, was an author of autobiographical or semi-autobiographical verse collections.[296] In the early years of the 18th century, the Irish dramatist George Farquhar resided in the town while acting as a recruiting officer for the Army. He drew on this experience in writing the comedy The Recruiting Officer.[144] The romantic novelist Mary Webb lived in and around outer Shrewsbury and was buried there upon her death. Before the First World War, the poet Wilfred Owen lived in the town and there is a memorial to Owen at Shrewsbury Abbey.[297] Comedian George Robey lived in the town, near Lord Hill's Column, before and during the Second World War.[298] Politicians with connections with the town include Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet, once Britain's richest man, he was MP for Shrewsbury from 1768 to 1805.[299] He lived in apartments at Shrewsbury Castle. Robert Clive was MP for Shrewsbury and also the mayor.[300][301] Leo Blair, the father of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, was a resident of the town.[302] Ian Hunter, the lead singer of the 1970s pop group Mott the Hoople, was a resident of 23a Swan Hill in the town centre and wrote a song of the same name.[303] The 1980s pop group T'Pau was formed in the town and the band's vocalist Carol Decker was educated in the town, along with other members of the band.[304] Notable music historian and composer Charles Burney was born and educated in the town.[305] Lange, a DJ and dance music producer, was born in Shrewsbury.[306] Sporting Salopians include four FA Cup Final winning players who took part in the first decade of the Cup's history were born in or lived in Shrewsbury: John Hawley Edwards, Henry Wace and John Wylie, of the Wanderers and Clopton Lloyd-Jones of Clapham Rovers.[307] Arthur Rowley, the Football League's highest scoring player, settled in Shrewsbury, having first come to the town as a Shrewsbury Town player, where he died in 2004.[308] More recent players are Danny Guthrie of Newcastle United,[309] Shrewsbury Town youth academy graduate and England goalkeeper Joe Hart[310] and Wales midfielder David Edwards were born in the town, as was Sheffield Wednesday and Scotland striker Steven Fletcher whose serviceman father was stationed there.[311] Sandy Lyle, a professional golfer, was born in the town.[312]\nNeville Cardus spent some of his formative years as assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School.[313] Other notable people of the town include; John Gwynn, an 18th-century architect, who designed the English Bridge and the bridge at Atcham, was born in the town;[314] comic book artist Charlie Adlard was born in Shrewsbury and is known for illustrating The Walking Dead; Robert Cadman, a performer and steeplejack, is buried in the town, at St Mary's Church;[315] Simon Gosling, a visual effects designer, was born in the town and was resident there until 1994;[316] Percy Thrower, the gardener and broadcaster lived in Shrewsbury, where he set up the garden centre near Meole Brace and just down the road from the football club.[317] Justin Pearson, an award-winning stunt performer and stunt coordinator currently lives in the town.[318] Hugo Botstiber, Austrian musicologist, died at Cotonhurst on 15 January 1941 only a few months after arriving in Shrewsbury. Being of Jewish origin, he had emigrated from Vienna in 1938.[319] Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock DSO, DFC and Bar was born in nearby Bayston Hill and was educated at Prestfelde preparatory school on London Road. Lock became internationally recognised as a high scoring fighter ace of the Royal Air Force in the Second World War with 26 victories before his death in combat at the age of 21. He was the RAF's most successful British-born pilot in the Battle of Britain.[320][321] One Victoria Cross recipient is known to have lived in Shrewsbury; Arthur Herbert Procter, who was decorated in 1916 during World War I and retired from his later full-time clergy ministry in 1964 to briefly live at Mytton Oak Road, Copthorne, before relocating to Sheffield.[322]"

Allinge-Sandvig and Tejn[10] were hit hardest, with roads being torn up by the storm. Many houses got destroyed or water damaged, and some houses even got swept away. Bornholm fared better than the rest of Denmark, but the coastal and fishing towns were in a poor state afterwards.[11]"

On 21 October, King's Cross railway station in Central London was closed due to overcrowding caused by the disruption. Avanti West Coast, LNER and Northern Trains advised passengers to avoid travelling after their lines were widely flooded.

The final cyclone of the 1987\u201388 Australian region cyclone season, Herbie was first identified northwest of the Cocos Islands on 17\u00a0May. The following day, the system was classified as a tropical low by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and intensified into a Category\u00a01 cyclone later that day. Several hours after this upgrade, the storm attained its initial peak intensity with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph 10-minute sustained). Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center classified Herbie as Tropical Storm 21S. On 19\u00a0May, the cyclone formed a new low-pressure center and relocated roughly 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) south. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to accelerate towards the southeast and started to undergo an extratropical transition. Early on 21\u00a0May, Herbie made landfall in Shark Bay before losing its identity the following day over the Great Australian Bight. Although a weak storm, Herbie brought flooding rains and severe dust storms to portions of Western Australia. Additionally, a 30,000\u00a0ton freighter broke in half amidst rough seas produced by the storm. Total losses from the storm reached A$20\u00a0million (US$15.6\u00a0million).

Later that day, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began monitoring the system as a tropical low.[1] Several hours after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 21S, having attained winds of 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph 1-minute sustained).[2] Following slight development, the system intensified into a Category\u00a01 cyclone and was given the name Herbie by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology early on 18\u00a0May.[1][3] Several hours after being named, the storm attained its initial peak intensity with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 990\u00a0hPa (mbar).[3] Around the same time, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, estimating the cyclone to have attained peak winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph 1-minute sustained).[2] On 19\u00a0May, satellite imagery of the system depicted that a new low pressure centre had developed roughly 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) south of the original low.[1] Several hours after the relocation, the JTWC downgraded Herbie to a tropical depression as the system's movement began to accelerate towards the southeast.[1][2] As the storm moved at a rapid speed towards the coastline of Western Australia, it began to undergo an extratropical transition. During a 24-hour period (20\u201321 May) Herbie tracked roughly 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi), with the movement of the storm reaching 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph) at times.[1] Late on 20\u00a0May, the JTWC ceased advisories on the system as it weakened below tropical depression status offshore.[2] However, the Bureau of Meteorology continued to monitor the system. Early on 21\u00a0May, the center of Herbie made landfall in Shark Bay with wind gusts up to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 980\u00a0hPa (mbar). Due to the rapid movement of the storm, it reached the Great Australian Bight while retaining tropical characteristics despite its low-latitude. Early on 22\u00a0May, the system lost its identity south of Australia as an extratropical cyclone.[1]"

According to officials in the coastal town of Denham, \"..the cyclone struck virtually without warning.\" Most tourists staying in the region evacuated the day before Herbie's arrival.[4] Herbie caused moderate structural damage across Western Australia in coastal areas between Carnarvon and Denham. Banana plantations within this area also sustained extensive damage.[1] In Denham, a storm surge of 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) broke the town's retaining wall and flooded low-lying areas along the shore.[1][5] Several fishing vessels were brought inland by the surge and left beached on streets once the water subsided.[1] About 15 homes in Denham lost their roofs after wind gusts estimated at 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) battered the town.[4][6] Due to the storms extratropical transition, areas south of Herbie received moderate to heavy rainfall while areas north of the center reported severe dust storms fueled by the cyclone's high winds. Most areas affected by the storms rain recorded around 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) with isolated totals near 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in).[1] The Irwin and Greenough Rivers overflowed their banks, inundating parts of Dongara.[7] In all, the storm wrought approximately A$20\u00a0million worth of structural and agricultural damage in Western Australia.[8] Offshore, a 30,000\u00a0ton freighter, the MV Korean Star, sustained extreme damage during the storm. Rough seas caused the hull of the ship to break and the vessel was separated into two pieces. Although the freighter was in two pieces, the ship did not sink and the wreckage of it came ashore near Cape Cuvier.[1] No one on the ship sustained injury as all 19 crew members abandoned ship.[9] The crew was rescued within a day of sustaining the damage and flown to Carnarvon.[4] In the wake of the storm, the town hall in Denham was converted into a temporary shelter for the homeless.[6] Repair to damaged roofs and downed power lines began on 22\u00a0May.[4] Within a few days of the storm's passage, appeals were made for relief funds in regions affected by Herbie.[10]  Although the storm caused relatively little damage, the name Herbie was retired following its usage and will never be used again to name a tropical cyclone in the Australian region.[11]"

The event was the fourth-largest tornado outbreak caused by a tropical cyclone in recorded history. After the hurricane made landfall on the extreme southwestern coast of Louisiana on September\u00a024, the tropical cyclone's strong rainbands affected much of the West South Central and East South Central States, producing heavy rainfall in addition to numerous tornadoes. Tornadic activity was distributed roughly evenly from September\u00a024\u201325, though activity shifted slightly eastward on September\u00a025. The severe activity ended by September\u00a026, by which time the remnants of Hurricane Rita were absorbed by a frontal boundary. As a result of Hurricane Rita, 98\u00a0tornadoes were confirmed over nearly a two-day period. Most of the tornadoes occurred in Mississippi, where 49\u00a0tornadoes were confirmed. With forty-four tornadoes in a single day, this is tied for the largest tornado outbreak in state history in a single day.[1] The strongest tornado throughout the outbreak was an F3\u00a0tornado which struck areas of southeastern Louisiana late on September\u00a024, injuring three people. Despite the large number of tornadoes, only one death resulted, which occurred as a result of an F1\u00a0tornado in Mississippi on September\u00a024. However, another F1\u00a0tornado near Starkville, Mississippi injured seven people on September\u00a025 making it the tornado with the most injuries during the outbreak. The same tornado was also the costliest, causing $2\u00a0million in damages. Overall, tornadoes during the outbreak killed one person and injured 23, and caused $18.373\u00a0million in damages."

Tracking westward, the disturbance quickly intensified to tropical storm intensity later that day before panning out in intensification due to increased wind shear.[2] However, Rita moved into favorable conditions in the Straits of Florida, allowing it to strengthen into hurricane strength on September\u00a020 and further to Category\u00a02 hurricane intensity six hours after.[3] The abundance of abnormally warm sea surface temperatures and a favorable outflow pattern allowed for continued rapid intensification.[4] By the time Rita emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, it was already a major hurricane.[nb 1][2] Intensification was further aided by the warm waters of the Loop Current, and as a result, Rita reached Category\u00a05 hurricane intensity on September\u00a021, the highest rating classified on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[3][6] At 0300\u00a0UTC on September\u00a022, Rita reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 895\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.43\u00a0inHg), making it the strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the fourth-strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the entirety of the Atlantic basin.[3] Rita maintained peak intensity for 18\u00a0hours before an eyewall replacement cycle took place on September\u00a022, causing the hurricane to weaken. At the same time, the initially westward moving storm began to curve northwestward. Although the cycle eventually completed, the movement of Rita over cooler continental shelf waters caused it to continue weakening. Rita weakened down to Category\u00a03 intensity before making landfall in extreme southwestern Louisiana at 0740\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024. At the time, the major hurricane had winds of 120\u00a0mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 937\u00a0mbar (937\u00a0hPa; 27.7\u00a0inHg). Once inland, Rita began to rapidly weaken as a result of increasing vertical wind shear. The hurricane was downgraded to tropical storm intensity roughly 12\u00a0hours after landfall.[3] Moving in a general northward motion, Rita degenerated into a tropical depression over southwestern Arkansas the following day based on weather radar.[7] The depression continued to weaken before it transitioned into a remnant low shortly before being absorbed by a cold front on September\u00a026 over Illinois.[3]"

Although there were no human victims, the estimated damage is thought to surpass the floods of 1970. By April 16 over 848 houses were reportedly flooded, with 221 destroyed.[1] The height of the Danube at the beginning of the flood was still below the record level registered in 1895.[2] Romanian officials ordered the controlled flooding of thousands of hectares of unused agricultural spaces to prevent further damage in cities across Romania. On April 16, in the localities of Rast and Negoi, Dolj County, more than 800 residents were evacuated, as a dam collapsed due to the rising waters of the Danube. Hundreds of houses were flooded and more than 100 of them collapsed. By April 22, the number of people evacuated from the locality reached 4,000.[3] In the port city of C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i, a recently opened hotel was flooded on Monday, April 17, causing significant damage to the building and leading to the evacuation of tens of tourists.[4]\nBy this date, the floods had swamped 730\u00a0km2 (280 square miles) of land, 400 kilometres (250\u00a0mi) of roads and destroyed 20 bridges, while also causing agricultural damage amounting to 4.6\u00a0million lei (US$1.5\u00a0million).  Additionally, five of Romania's nine Danube ports were closed during the flooding period.[1] However, Romanian authorities said on April 22 that the worst of the flooding had passed. Elena Anghel, hydrologist at Romania's National Hydrology Institute stated that, \"The forecasts are optimistic. The river will probably remain stable for another two days and then start to fall.\"[3] However, by April 28, after several weeks of pressure, key lev\u00e9es along the Danube began collapsing in the counties of Dolj, C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i, Constan\u021ba, Tulcea and Gala\u021bi.

        "content": " Hurricane Paulette was a strong and long-lived Category 2 Atlantic hurricane which became the first to make landfall in Bermuda since Hurricane Gonzalo in 2014, and was the longest-lasting tropical cyclone of 2020 globally. The sixteenth named storm and sixth hurricane of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Paulette developed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on September\u00a02. The wave eventually consolidated into a tropical depression on September 7. Paulette fluctuated in intensity over the next few days, due to strong wind shear, initially peaking as a strong tropical storm on September 8. It eventually strengthened into a hurricane early on September\u00a013 as shear decreased. On September\u00a014, Paulette made landfall in northeastern Bermuda as a Category\u00a02 hurricane, while making a gradual turn to the northeast. The cyclone further strengthened as it moved away from the island, reaching its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central atmospheric pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg) on September\u00a014. On the evening of September\u00a015, Paulette began to weaken and undergo extratropical transition, which it completed on September\u00a016. The hurricane's extratropical remnants persisted and moved southward then eastward, and eventually, Paulette regenerated into a tropical storm early on September\u00a020 south of the Azores\u2013 which resulted in the U.S National Weather Service coining the phrase \"zombie storm\" to describe its unusual regeneration.[1][2] Paulette's second phase proved short-lived, however, as the storm quickly weakened and became post-tropical again two days later. The remnant persisted for several days before dissipating south of the Azores on September\u00a028. In total, Paulette was a tropical cyclone for 11.25 days, and the system had an overall lifespan of 21 days (3.0 weeks).[3] Paulette brought hurricane-force sustained winds and heavy rain to Bermuda, causing widespread power outages on the island. Paulette caused an estimated US$50 million in damage in the country.[4] Large swells affected the East Coast of the United States, and 2 people drowned off the coasts of New Jersey and South Carolina, respectively, after getting caught in rip currents generated by the hurricane. Minimal impacts were recorded in Azores from Paulette's second stint as a tropical cyclone."

However, convective activity remained disorganized.[6] Despite this, the disturbance gained sufficient organization by 00:00 UTC on September 7 to be designated a tropical depression, about 1,160 miles (1,870\u00a0km) west of the Cabo Verde Islands.[7][3] Late on that morning, an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) pass indicated that the depression had begun to produce winds up to gale-force, warranting its upgrade to Tropical Storm Paulette 12 hours later.[3] Paulette moved generally west-northwestward over the warm Atlantic waters and gradually strengthened on September 8, despite the presence of southwesterly wind shear and mid-level dry air in its vicinity. This caused most of its thunderstorms to be dislocated from the low-level circulation (LLC) on satellite images.[8] As a high-pressure area began to develop to the north, Paulette accelerated slightly on the same day.[3] At 15:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08, Paulette reached its first peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 996 mbars (29.41 inHg).[9][3] It sustained this intensity for roughly 12\u00a0hours before an upper-level trough strengthened wind shear, with its levels reaching as high as 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), putting a halt to Paulette's intensification.[5][10] Despite these hostile conditions, weakening remained slow, and the storm's circulation became exposed on satellite images on September 9.[11]"

        "content": "Wind shear began to gradually decrease by September 10, which allowed Paulette to resume its slow strengthening trend.[3] Around this time, the area of high-pressure steering Paulette had developed a weakness to the storm's northwest, allowing Paulette to begin to turn northwest in its direction and cause its forward speed to increase.[3] As it exited its unfavorable environment the cyclone continued to intensify into September 12, nearing Category 1 hurricane strength and displaying an eye-like feature on visible satellite imagery.[12] By late on September 12, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and confirmed that Paulette had intensified into a hurricane at 00:00 UTC on September 13, on its approach to the island of Bermuda.[13][3] The hurricane made a turn back to the west-northwest as yet another area of high-pressure built to Paulette's northeast, causing the storm to round the edge of it.[3] Thus, Paulette began to be steered more towards Bermuda while it continued to intensify, though its strengthening was limited by occasional intrusions of dry air.[14] Paulette reached Category 2 strength on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale shortly before its large eye passed directly over, or made landfall, in Bermuda at 07:30 UTC on September 14 with estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[3] Paulette reached its peak intensity after passing north of Bermuda with 1-minute sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 965\u00a0mb (28.5\u00a0inHg).[3] Around this time, Paulette began to accelerate to the northeast within the mid-latitude flow.[3] Paulette began extratropical transition by September 15, while its wind speeds began to diminish.[15] By 12:00 UTC on September 16, Paulette completed its transition and became an extratropical cyclone about 350\u00a0nmi (400\u00a0mi; 650\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland over the cool waters of the Northern Atlantic, as it interacted with the baroclinic zone.[3]"

Wade International Airport, ceased operation throughout September 13\u201315, while government offices and public schools were closed nationally.[22] Multiple observing stations in Bermuda started reporting tropical storm-force wind gusts beginning at 23:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, with sustained tropical storm-force winds coming soon after.[23] Early on September\u00a014, a wind gust of 117\u00a0mph (188\u00a0km/h) was measured at the Marine Operations Center (MAROPS), which is elevated at 290 feet (88\u00a0m) above sea level.[24] This came just over an hour after an island-wide power outage affected all of Bermuda, including the BWS, with only cell phone service remaining active. This led to an estimated 22,847 people losing electrical service.[25] Despite COVID-19 concerns, 50 people decided to seek refuge in the Cedarbridge Academy building as Paulette passed over the island.[26][27] The hurricane's eye was so clear during its nighttime landfall that when it passed over the island, one resident reported he could see stars and planets in the sky.[28] The collaboration between the BWS and U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) was the first in which the NHC provided detailed hourly intensity estimates and forecasts, based on radar images and other weather data provided by the BWS, prior to the radar going offline as the storm's eyewall came ashore.[26] A storm surge of 2.38\u00a0ft (0.73\u00a0m) above normal tide was recorded by a U.S. National Ocean Service (NOS) station in Eastern Bermuda, while a maximum official rainfall total of 2.91\u00a0in (74\u00a0mm) fell at the Bermuda Weather Service office.[3] By September 17, 250 customers still remained without power on the island.[29] The commercial fishing industry in Bermuda came to a standstill as Hurricane Paulette, and Hurricane Teddy a week later, impacted the island back-to-back.[30] Paulette and Teddy were also responsible for flooding and coastal erosion impacting several of Bermuda's nature reserves, such as Coopers Island Nature Reserve or Spittal Pond Nature Reserve.[31] Several islands of Castle Harbour sustained significant erosion on cliffs, which caused some of the fortified walls to collapse, due to the heavy surf.[31] Residents reported their homes had sustained some damage, but such infrastructural damage was rather minimal, since structures on Bermuda have been built to withstand high wind speeds and other severe weather events, which frequently occur on the island.[26][32] There were no reported casualties or otherwise serious property damage in Bermuda, but many trees were uprooted and debris were lofted, blocking roads.[33] Following the storm, Royal Bermuda Regiment soldiers were deployed to assess damage, clear roads, and provide assistance to affected locals.[34] Bermuda Minister of National Security Ren\u00e9e Ming and Bermuda Premier David Burt appraised the Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) crews, who quickly restored electricity for thousands of customers, and they expressed gratefulness for the lack of damage, due to appropriate preparations for the hurricane, whom the latter described as a \"remarkable achievement\".[35][36] Overall, damage in Bermuda was estimated at US$50 million.[4]"

One of the children, a six-year-old boy, died at a hospital after being rescued, while the woman sustained minor injuries and was taken to the hospital.

        "content": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Dinah was an intense tropical cyclone that impacted the southern coasts of Queensland and New South Wales, causing floods and landslides in 1967. It was regarded by an official in the Bureau of Meteorology's Brisbane Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre as the strongest storm to approach the southern coasts of Queensland since reliable records began. Forming on January 22 in the South Pacific basin, nearly 620 kilometers to the southeast of Honiara in the  Solomon Islands, the disturbance that would eventually be Dinah remained disorganized until the next day when the system started to organize under the warm waters of the Coral Sea. On January 24, the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical cyclone by the BoM and was named Dinah, being the fifth storm in the records of the meteorology center of Australia in the 1966\u201367 Australian region cyclone season. Environmental conditions favoured Dinah to further intensify, becoming a severe tropical cyclone on January 27 while recurving south-southwestwards. On the next day, it passed through the Great Barrier Reef as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone before passing through Fraser Island on January 29, where the Sandy Cape Lighthouse recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 944.8 hPa on Dinah, being the lowest known pressure of the system. It then battered the whole island before turning south-southeastwards, away from the coast of Queensland. Weakening took place while slowing down, passing near Lord Howe Island as a Category 2 tropical cyclone before undergoing extratropical transition on January 31. Dinah became extratropical on the night of that day before accelerating eastward, approaching New Zealand. The system then turned southeastward for the final time before passing through the North Island. It reemerged on the Southern Pacific Ocean on February 3, where it dissipated. According to a study, Dinah caused the largest waves being observed in the southern part of Queensland in centuries. The system also inflicted extensive damage on Heron Island during its passage to the southern part of the state, starting with the flooding of massive north-easterly swellings and a day later with heavy winds. Although Dinah remained offshore, its outer rainbands caused heavy rains and gusty winds that uprooted trees, starting from Rockhampton Region to Grafton in New South Wales. Some residential institutions lost their roofs due to the wind, while banana and sugarcane crops were destroyed and inundated by floodwaters. Severe erosions were reported in Emu Park and Maryborough-Bundaberg areas. Massive rainfall amounts were recorded in some parts of Queensland, New South Wales and New Zealand's North Island as the extratropical remnant. Storm surges were also seen on Sunshine Coast, Queensland. Tourists on Lord Howe Island were stranded by the storm, while many residents had to be rescued on different beaches due to large swells. A man in North Island in New Zealand was feared drowned due to Dinah, while another was missing due to his car being submerged in floods. The damage was described as severe, but the numerical amounts were unknown."

The twenty-fifth depression, twenty-fourth named storm and ninth hurricane of the extremely active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Gamma developed from a vigorous tropical wave that had been monitored as it was entering the Eastern Caribbean on September\u00a029. The wave moved westward and slowed down as it moved into the Western Caribbean, where it began to interact with a dissipating cold front. A low formed within the disturbance on October\u00a01 and the next day, it organized into a tropical depression. It further organized into Tropical Storm Gamma early the next day. It continued to intensify and made landfall as a minimal hurricane near Tulum, Mexico, on October\u00a03. It weakened over land before reemerging in the Gulf of Mexico. Gamma then briefly restrengthened some before being blasted by high amounts of wind shear, causing it to weaken again. It made a second landfall as a tropical depression in Nichili, Mexico on October\u00a06 before dissipating as it was absorbed by the approaching Hurricane Delta. Numerous tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for parts of Mexico in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula following the formation of Gamma and thousands of people were evacuated. Gamma produced strong winds, heavy rainfall, flash flooding, landslides, and mudslides to the region. At least seven fatalities have been confirmed so far.

        "content": "On September\u00a029, the National Hurricane Center began to monitor a tropical wave over the Lesser Antilles for potential development as it moved into the Western Caribbean.[1] It drifted slowly westward and remained very broad and disorganized for a couple of days.[2] As it neared the coast of Honduras on October\u00a01, the wave spawned a broad low pressure area and began to quickly organize over the unusually warm waters of the Western Caribbean.[3] By 15:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02, the low had become sufficiently organized to be designated as Tropical Depression Twenty-Five.[4] The system continued to organize, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Gamma at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a03,[5] becoming the earliest 24th tropical or subtropical Atlantic storm on record, surpassing the old mark of October 27, set by Hurricane Beta in 2005.[6] Gamma began to quickly intensify afterward, reaching just below hurricane strength as an eye began to form at 15:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a03.[7] By 16:45\u00a0UTC that same day, Gamma had reached minimal Category\u00a01 hurricane status and made landfall near Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico, at peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 978\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg).[8] Operationally, the NHC noted that Gamma was very near hurricane strength at the time of landfall, but kept it at high-end tropical storm status.[9] After making landfall, Gamma weakened before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) winds and a central pressure of 995\u00a0mb (29.4\u00a0inHg) on October\u00a04.[10] Its forward motion then slowed as a ridge developed to the north. Gamma then subsequently restrengthened to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) around mid-day, although this proved to be brief, as its central pressure increased and winds decreased in speed.[11] As Gamma stalled a rapid increase in wind shear decoupled central convection by that evening, causing it to move further east than originally forecast.[12][13] Gamma began to weaken shortly thereafter as it turned southwestward.[14] Though strongly sheared, there was vigorous convection located 60 miles north of Gamma's center.[15] Operationally, Gamma was declared post tropical at 03:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05 as the convection being produced around the cyclone was assessed as being due to a sea breeze boundary.[16][17] However, post-storm analysis determined that this was premature as Gamma was still producing enough convection in its northeastern quadrant to remain a tropical storm. The storm weakened to a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05 and began moving southwestward due to a building mid-level ridge to its north as well as a binary interaction with the circulation of soon-to-be Hurricane Delta. Gamma then made its final landfall at Nichili, Mexico at 03:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06. Although convection redeveloped over the center at landfall, Gamma became increasingly enveloped in the circulation of nearby Hurricane Delta and it low-level circulation dissipated at 18:00\u00a0UTC as its remnants were absorbed by Delta as it passed over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and into the Gulf of Mexico.[8][18]"

Numerous flights were affected at the Cancun International Airport and in Cozumel.[21] In Tabasco, roughly 3,400 people evacuated to shelters.[22] A weather station at Xel-Ha Park just north of the landfall point at Tulum, reported a sustained wind of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) and a gust to 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) around the time of landfall.[9] Some areas received more than 12 inches of rainfall, with over 15 inches of rain falling at Tizimin.[8] At least 6\u00a0people died and thousands were evacuated in southeastern Mexico after Tropical Storm Gamma lashed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Four of the deaths, which included two children, occurred in Chiapas after a landslide buried a home. Two other deaths occurred in Tabasco after a person was swept away by floodwaters and another drowned.[23] Another death's cause was not specified, bringing the total number of deaths to seven. In addition, a total number of 5,000 people in Tabasco were displaced due to the storm.[24] More than 41,000 tourists were present in Quintana Roo at the time, with the area only recently reopened to tourism after a pandemic shutdown.[22] 39 flights to Cancun were cancelled, and another 20 were delayed. Ferry routes were \"suspended until further notice\", and nearly 30 vessels were completely or partially sunk due to high waves.[21] Fishermen and tourism service providers guarded boats to prevent further damage.[25]"

The second flood, caused by a large-scale debris flow upstream, brought in a large amount of sediment and debris which caused great damage.[1] The muddy torrent hit the Higashi-Eisho-cho area in front of Isahaya Station, broke the levee upstream on the east side of Shimen Bridge, cut through Tenma-cho, and also destroyed the right-bank levee behind Takagi Shrine.[2][3] Furthermore, debris got caught in the Megane Bridge, built during the 1830s of stone to prevent it from being washed away by floods. It stood, but the debris blocked the escape of floodwaters, causing further damage.[2] Kumamoto City recorded a daily precipitation of 480.5mm, exceeding the daily precipitation of 411.9mm during the 1953 Shirakawa flood in north Kyushu."

Santa Fe is the fifth most populated city in Argentina (c. 370,000 inhabitants), and it is surrounded by rivers.  The flooding was described as the worst since the city was founded in 1573.[1] At the end of April 2003, several days of heavy rainfall caused some major rivers in the Santa Fe area to rise as much as 50\u00a0cm in 12 hours. The water level of the Salado River (which flows through the north of the province and empties into the Paran\u00e1) rose by almost two metres in just three hours. On 28 April, the Salado overflowed its margins and flooded large sections of Santa Fe.[2] About 100,000 people had to be evacuated, 154 people died, and 28,000 houses were damaged or destroyed. A dyke had to be blown up in order for ease the flow of the floodwaters out of the city. In this key area for the agricultural and ranching industries, over 30,000\u00a0km2 of farmland were destroyed. The flood hit the capital hardest, but many other communities were also affected. The flood was unusual because it is generally the east side of Santa Fe, beside the Paran\u00e1, which is affected by floodings. Salado River floodings are less usual.[citation needed] Soon after the initial flooding, President Eduardo Duhalde declared the province a \"disaster zone\" and announced a $2 million emergency aid package. The World Bank later offered an additional $110 million. The Red Cross launched an emergency appeal in response to the flooding on 6 May. According to a UN assessment requested by the provincial governor Carlos Reutemann, the total damages were about $1,000 million, and implied the loss of about 12% of Santa Fe's GDP. The rains continued into the next days, exacerbating the catastrophe. As of 8 May, a quarter of Santa Fe remained under water. Precarious evacuation centres appeared in the capital and nearby towns to accommodate the evacuees. The provincial government was heavily criticized for ignoring warnings about the possibility of a sudden rise of the Salado River, and for ignoring appeals to build the necessary preventive infrastructure to contain or divert floods. The official treatment of the people who lost their homes, possessions and jobs was also questioned; food relief and promised subsidies for reconstruction were insufficient. Governor Reutemann saw the end of his term in office marked by these problems. The critical situation of Argentina at the time (recovering from a major economic crisis) did not help. On 30 January 2004, nine months after the flood and under the administration of Jorge Obeid, a demonstration asking for government assistance to those affected by the flood ended with the burning of the government house's facade and several offices destroyed."

The cloud pattern slowly organized, and on January 31, while located  east of Tuvalu, Ofa attained cyclone intensity. Moving slowly southeast, Ofa developed storm-force winds. It attained hurricane-force winds on February 2. Cyclone Ofa reached peak intensity on February 4. Shortly after, its peak Ofa began to weaken over a less favourable environment. Ofa was declared an extratropical cyclone on February 8, though the system was still tracked by meteorologists until February 10. Ofa produced gales or high winds or gales on many islands, resulting in widespread damage due to a combination of storm surge and high seas. In all, eight people were killed and damage totaled to US$187\u00a0million. The worst effects were recorded in Samoa, where seven people were killed. Roughly 200 people were evacuated, and 10 to 20 others were injured through the islands. Extreme damage to crops and trees was also recorded.

        "content": " Tropical Storm Colin was the earliest third named storm in the Atlantic basin on record for four years, until it was surpassed by Tropical Storm Cristobal in 2020. An atypical, poorly organized tropical cyclone, Colin developed from a low pressure area over the Gulf of Mexico near the northern coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula late on June\u00a05, 2016. Moving northward, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm about eight hours after its formation. On June\u00a06, Colin curved to the north-northeast and intensified slightly to winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Strong wind shear prevented further strengthening and resulted in the system maintaining a disheveled appearance on satellite imagery. Later, the storm began accelerating to the northeast. Early on June\u00a07, Colin made landfall in rural Taylor County, Florida, still at peak intensity. The system rapidly crossed northern Florida and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean several hours later. By late on June\u00a07, Colin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone offshore North Carolina before being absorbed by a frontal boundary the following day. Upon the development of Colin on June\u00a05, a tropical storm warning was issued for much of the west coast of Florida, followed by tropical storm warnings and watches on Atlantic coast from Central Florida to North Carolina later on June\u00a05 and June\u00a06. Governor of Florida Rick Scott declared a state of emergency, while schools and colleges closed in several counties. The storm produced heavy rainfall over portions of Florida, resulting in flooding in some areas, especially Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. There, the freshwater flooding was compounded by coastal flooding from high tides. Winds caused over 93,300\u00a0power outages throughout the state. The storm spawned two tornadoes, one of which knocked down trees and damaged several cars and homes in Jacksonville. Four fatalities occurred in the Florida Panhandle due to drowning. Heavy rainfall was also observed in portions of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Two additional drowning deaths occurred in Georgia. Damage throughout the East Coast reached $1.04\u00a0million (2016\u00a0USD).[1]"

        "content": "The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) over the Gulf of Mexico and northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on June\u00a01. The Two indicated the probability of the development of a low pressure area, which would have a 20% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next five days.[2] By June\u00a03, a concentrated area of showers and thunderstorms developed in the western Caribbean Sea, resulting in an increasing probability of tropical cyclogenesis within 48\u00a0hours.[3] Despite land interaction with the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and unfavorably strong wind shear, the system reached an 80% chance of developing in the next 48\u00a0hours by early on June\u00a05.[4] It then moved inland over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, but continued to organize.[5] After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the system developed a well-defined circulation, according to surface data and satellite imagery. Thus, the NHC upgraded it to on Tropical Depression Three at 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a05, while located just north of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[6] The northward-moving depression was lopsided, with the circulation being well to the west of an elongated band of deep convection.[7] Later that day, after a reconnaissance aircraft observed tropical storm force winds,[8] the cyclone was upgraded to Tropical Storm Colin at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[6] Colin became the earliest third tropical storm in the Atlantic basin, exceeding the previous record set by Tropical Storm Three on June\u00a012, 1887.[9] Despite the intensification, the storm remained poorly organized due to strong wind shear, with the low-level center being indistinguishable on infrared satellite imagery.[10] Early on June\u00a06, data from surface observations, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and a reconnaissance aircraft flight suggested that two small-scale circulations existed.[11] Shortly thereafter, NHC noted that the \"satellite presentation of Colin does not resemble that of a classical tropical cyclone\", as convection and strong winds were displaced well east of the center, primarily due to wind shear.[12] The storm began accelerating to the northeast late on June\u00a06 due to a mid- to upper-level trough over the Midwestern United States.[13] Despite this, Colin was able to reach its peak intensity at 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a07, with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1,001\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg).[6] Two hours later, the cyclone made landfall in Keaton Beach, Florida, at peak intensity.[6] Continuing rapidly northeastward, Colin quickly crossed North Florida and southern Georgia, reaching the Atlantic Ocean before 09:00\u00a0UTC. The storm appeared to be \"not very tropical\", though large areas of deep convection continued to exist to the east and southeast of the center.[14] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a07, the system had frontal features and thus transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, just off the Carolinas coast.[6]"

        "content": "On September\u00a017, the NHC first noted the potential for tropical cyclone development near the southeast coast of the United States in its seven day outlook.[3] A few days later, a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms developed east of Florida within an offshore trough of low pressure.[4] A broad non-tropical area of low pressure formed within the area on September\u00a021. Anticipating that the low could acquire some tropical or subtropical characteristics as it continued to form, coupled with its close proximity to the Southeastern United States, the NHC initiated advisories on it as Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen at 15:00\u00a0UTC that day.[5] The system's minimum barometric pressure fell appreciably on the morning of September\u00a022, as it moved generally northward, still attached to a frontal feature. It was generating sustained tropical storm-force winds within its broad, asymmetric wind field, and the deep convection was concentrated to the north of the poorly formed, indistinct low level center of the circulation.[6] Later that day, it became detached from the frontal feature, and was designated Tropical Storm Ophelia.[7] The storm made landfall at 10:15\u00a0UTC, near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, about 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) west-northwest of Cape Lookout, with winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 981\u00a0mbar (28.97\u00a0inHg).[8] By 0:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, the system had lost its tropical characteristics, becoming a post-tropical cyclone after crossing into southeast Virginia.[2] The next day, its remnant circulation moved eastward off the New Jersey coast, as rains from the system swept northward into New England.[9]  The remnants of Ophelia were absorbed by another offshore low-pressure area a few days later. This low pressure ended up causing severe floods in New York City on the evening of September\u00a029.[10]"

        "content": "Hurricane Noel was a deadly tropical cyclone that carved a path of destruction across the Atlantic Ocean from the Caribbean Sea to Newfoundland in late October 2007. The sixteenth tropical depression, fourteenth named storm, and the sixth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Noel formed on October 27 from the interaction between a tropical wave and an upper-level low in the north-central Caribbean. It strengthened to winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) before making landfall on western Haiti and the north coast of eastern Cuba. Noel turned northward, and on November 1, it attained hurricane status. The hurricane accelerated northeastward after crossing the Bahamas, and on November 2, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. (The Canadian Hurricane Centre classified Noel as a \"post-tropical storm\" until 2200 UTC on November 4, when the CHC determined that Noel had lost all tropical characteristics.) The storm caused at least 163 direct deaths along its path, primarily in Dominican Republic and Haiti, due to flooding and mudslides. It was the deadliest North Atlantic hurricane of the 2007 hurricane season. After its extratropical transition, Noel became a very strong low pressure system, causing flooding and wind damage over Maine and Eastern Canada, with heavy rainfall occurring across Atlantic Canada, and snowfall over some areas of Eastern Quebec and Labrador. Noel's remnants subsequently merged with Cyclone Tilo, a powerful European windstorm, which later struck Western Europe and contributed to the North Sea flood of 2007 on the night of November 8\u20139."

        "content": "A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on October 16. It tracked westward, initially without organization, and by October 22 was interacting with a trough while approaching the Lesser Antilles. This caused a low pressure area to develop on October\u00a023 about 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) east-northeast of the northern Lesser Antilles. The system continued westward with disorganized convection, and was unable to develop further due to strong wind shear.[1] Despite the shear, convection increased as barometric pressures dropped in association with the organizing system.[2] Turning west-southwestward, the low passed over the United States Virgin Islands on October\u00a025 and just southeast of Puerto Rico the next day. Decreasing wind shear on October\u00a027 allowed the thunderstorms to increase over the center late on October\u00a027. After further organization, the system developed into Tropical Depression Sixteen at 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a028, about 215\u00a0mi (346\u00a0km) south-southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti.[1] Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the depression to track west-northwestward, brushing southwestern Haiti before moving ashore along south-central Cuba.[3] Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the tropical depression was moving to the west-northwest, under the steering currents of a high pressure area over the western Atlantic Ocean.[3] Six hours after formation, the center of the storm became difficult to locate,[4] though subsequently the tropical depression became much better organized; a large area of convection developed over the center, with several rainbands to its south.[5] Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Noel at 1815\u00a0UTC on October 28, while located about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) south-southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti.[6] After the center re-developed beneath the thunderstorms, the storm quickly strengthened to winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h),[7] and for several hours, the cyclone was drifting to the south of Hispaniola. Noel began to lose organization as a nearby upper-level low increased wind shear,[8] with the circulation becoming ill-defined, as it further interacted with the mountainous terrain of Haiti.[9] The storm crossed western Haiti as a disorganized tropical storm on October 29,[10] and subsequently began moving parallel to the northeastern coast of Cuba, while moving around the southwestern periphery of a weakening ridge.[11] On October 30, Noel made landfall near Gibara, Cuba, with winds of about 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[12][13] The center of Noel remained well-organized as it tracked through eastern Cuba, though its sustained winds quickly diminished to minimal tropical storm force.[14] Early on October 31, Noel began drifting to the north-northwest, in response to the approach of a short-wave trough from the west and the eastward shift of the mid-level ridge.[15] A large area of strong convective rainbands persisted to its east, though due to increased upper-level wind shear, there was little convection near the center.[16] Shortly after 1200\u00a0UTC, on October 31, Noel emerged off the north coast of Cuba,[17] and subsequently, the cyclone became better organized as storm's the circulation became better associated with the convection.[18] While located just off the north coast of Cuba, the motion of Noel was nearly stationary, though forecasters indicated it could have executed a small cyclonic loop.[19] On October 31, the Canadian Hurricane Centre began tracking the storm.[20] Convection increased early on November 1, though initially the center remained to the southwest of the large area of thunderstorms.[21] At 1800\u00a0UTC that day, the storm passed over the Bahamian island of New Providence near the city of Nassau.[22] Later that day, the center tracked beneath the convection,[23] and Noel accelerated northeastward, in the southwesterly flow ahead of an approaching trough; as it did so, the center became elongated and distorted.[24] The cyclone maintained a large, round area of deep convection with well-defined outflow, and an eye feature became evident on satellite imagery. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, the National Hurricane Center upgraded Noel to hurricane status early on November 2, about 180 miles (290\u00a0km) north-northeast of Nassau, Bahamas.[25] Noel's convection began to wane as it moved through progressively cooler waters, and as the storm lost tropical characteristics, its wind field expanded.[26] By late on November 2, the inner core had substantially diminished, and the thermodynamic structure of the cyclone had become asymmetrical and frontal. As Noel began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued their final advisory on Hurricane Noel.[27] Early on November 3, Noel's extratropical remnant attained winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h), and it gradually turned to the north-northeast.[28] As the center of Noel approached Nova Scotia, its large circulation produced strong winds across all of Atlantic Canada and New England,[29] and on November 4, the storm tracked across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.[30] At 6 PM AST (2200 UTC) on November 4, as the storm was over Labrador, the Canadian Hurricane Center declared that Noel had lost all tropical characteristics and changed its designation from post-tropical to extratropical.[31] The extratropical low continued to the northeast and made landfall over southwest Greenland on the afternoon of November 5, bringing tropical storm force winds to the area. Noel's circulation dissipated over Greenland later that night. While its lowest barometric pressure as a tropical system was 980 mb, on November 4, while located near Labrador, it registered a minimum pressure of 966 mb.[32] Noel's remnants subsequently turned east and crossed the Atlantic Ocean, before merging into the powerful European windstorm Cyclone Tilo, over the Norwegian Sea, on November 7."

In Haiti, Health care centers were advised to activate any emergency plans, and medicine stocks were pre-positioned if needed. Residents in flood-prone areas were evacuated.[36] In the departments of Sud-Est, Sud, Grand'Anse, Nippes, Ouest, Centre and Artibonie, a red alert was issued, while an orange alert was issued for Nord-Est, Nord and Nord-Ouest.[37] In the Dominican Republic, 14,500\u00a0people sought protection in shelters.[38] About 1,000 inmates were evacuated from a prison north of the country's capital city.[39] The National Emergency Commission authorized the opening of a number of shelters, and the Dominican Red Cross activated search and rescue teams. The Coordination Centre set up a \"crisis room\", assigning workers to 24-hour shifts.[40] A hurricane watch was issued for southeastern Cuba; a tropical storm warning was in effect for the southeastern Bahamas, including the Turks and Caicos Islands, and a tropical storm watch was put in place for the central Bahamas.[41] A tropical storm warning was also issued for the northwestern Bahamas.[13] There, most government offices were closed during the passage of the storm.[42] On the island of Andros, residents took extra care in securing their boats.[43] As the storm tracked further to the northwest, a tropical storm warning was put in place for the Cuban provinces of Guant\u00e1namo, Holgu\u00edn, Las Tunas, Ciego de \u00c1vila, and Camag\u00fcey.[13][44] The Cuban Institute of Meteorology advised caution to residents, due to previous heavy rainfall leaving grounds saturated.[45] Several schools were closed during the storm's onslaught.[46] In Camag\u00fcey, thousands of cattle were moved to higher ground, and roughly 3,000 students working to harvest coffee crops were forced to return home.

Similar advisories were placed into effect from Virginia Beach, Virginia to Ocean City, Maryland. A coastal flood watch was issued for parts of New York, including Long Island.[48][49] As the extratropical storm progressed north, wind advisories were posted along the coast of New England,[48] and a winter storm watch was issued for northern Maine.[50] The Cape Cod and Islands division of the Red Cross opened a number of shelters on Nantucket and along coastal Massachusetts. Stores on Cape Cod were closed; some of them boarded up windows,[51] and the U.S. Coast Guard completed preparations and warned sailors of the storm.[52] Prior to the arrival of Noel into Atlantic Canada, heavy rain and strong wind warnings were put in place for many locations in southeastern Canada. The Canadian Hurricane Center issued hurricane-force wind warnings for waters to the southwest of the Maritimes and gale warnings for waters elsewhere off of southeastern Canada. The Halifax and Montreal Storm Prediction Centers of the Meteorological Service of Canada issued high winds and heavy rain warning for all the areas of the Maritimes, Newfoundland, Labrador and Eastern Quebec, as well as heavy snow warnings for certain regions.[28] Air Canada canceled 13 of their flights in and out of Halifax.

The highest 24\u00a0hour total noted was at Mangos de Baragu\u00e1, where 364\u00a0mm (14.3\u00a0in) fell between the mornings of October 29 and October 30.[86] Strong winds and rough waves were reported along the northern coastline.[76] The storm caused severe flooding and mudslides, which damaged over 21,000\u00a0homes in the province of Granma alone,[46][87] and destroyed about 120\u00a0homes in Camag\u00fcey.[88] Flooding isolated a few areas,[42] and destroyed more than 3.9\u00a0million\u00a0lb (1.8\u00a0million\u00a0kg) of crops in Ciego de \u00c1vila Province.[44] The rainfall contributed to precipitation totals being 300% of the normal rainfall in Guant\u00e1namo Province, which caused a dam in the province to overflow.[62] In the province of Santiago, about 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) of roads were damaged. At least 98,000 people throughout the country evacuated from the flooding; of which nearly 20,000 did so to escape the Cauto River which topped its banks, and 40,000 were in the province of Granma. Many stayed in shelters. Of Cuba's 239 rivers, at least 137 overflowed.[89] One fatality was reported in Cuba; total damage is estimated at $500\u00a0million (2007\u00a0USD).[1] Tropical Storm Noel dropped heavy rainfall across portions of the Bahamas,[76] reaching a record total of 15 inches (380\u00a0mm) at one station.[44] Sustained winds were around 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) throughout the central and northwestern regions of the island chain.[90] Extensive flooding was reported, especially on Abaco Island,[91] forcing the evacuation of over 700\u00a0people. Long Island was hit the worst, where flood waters reportedly reached 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) deep.[92] Residents of the island deemed the damage \"devastating\", reporting that flood waters were the highest in 60 years.[93]\nIn some locations, houses were under several feet of water, while roads throughout the Bahamas suffered damage.[94] The Deadman's Cay Airport was also flooded, and on the island of Exuma, six of the nine schools received extensive damage.[95] About 16,000\u00a0people were affected by the floods, including 10,000 on Long Island.[96] The Nassau International Airport was closed due to the storm, and most cruise ships failed to arrive on schedule.[97] One fatality occurred when a man on the island of Exuma abandoned a stalled truck, and was subsequently swept away by flood waters into a nearby pond.[98] When Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham visited hard-hit areas to assess the damage, he stated that it would be possible for Public Works to \"be able to get some pumps in to pump some of the water out.\" However, he also noted that, \"In some areas that will be very difficult because you have ponds on both sides of the road.\"[95]"

At Cedar Island, sustained winds of 43\u00a0mph (69\u00a0km/h) were reported. Along the coast from Cape Lookout northward, gusts peaked at around 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[105] The storm produced strong waves, flooding NC 12 with up to 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) of water and sand on November 3.[106] About 6,000\u00a0people lost power after winds knocked down a power line. Eight oceanfront properties were damaged,[107] and damage in North Carolina totaled $72,000 (2007\u00a0USD).[106] As Noel was tracking northward parallel to the U.S. East Coast, high winds affected several states.[108] Beach erosion was reported in New Jersey, in some cases eroding a 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) vertical drop.[109] On Long Island, strong winds knocked down trees and power lines.[110] On November 3, the western side of the storm hit eastern New England, particularly coastal Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine, with hurricane-force wind gusts. Massachusetts reported the highest wind gust of 89\u00a0mph (143\u00a0km/h), with sustained winds topping out at 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). Throughout Cape Cod, trees and tree limbs were downed.[111] Rainfall peaked at 5.03\u00a0in (128\u00a0mm) at Cutler Rainwise, Maine, while other reports ranged from 2 to 4 inches (51 to 102\u00a0mm) across the region.[112] In northern Maine, temperatures were cold enough to support 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) of snowfall.[113] Strong surf caused flooding along the coast, with Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard suffering the most;[114] several beachfront houses were severely damaged. A few roads were closed, mainly due to flooding and downed trees and tree limbs. Old North Wharf in Nantucket was damaged beyond repair, while numerous small boats were washed ashore.[115] Power outages were widespread; about 80,000 customers in Massachusetts, mostly on Cape Cod, and 9,000 in Maine lost electric power.[113] Despite the effects, no fatalities or significant property damage were reported.[116]"

Many flights were cancelled out of several airports, and around 150,000\u00a0people in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia lost power for several days, due to high winds and \"salt fog\" disabling the power grid. Flooding was also reported due to the heavy rainfall.[117] In Prince Edward Island, 10,000\u00a0people lost electricity. Newfoundland was relatively unaffected, although ferries between it and Nova Scotia were canceled for the entire weekend and winds peaked at 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) in Wreckhouse.[118][119] Over 70\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in) of rainfall was received in some areas, and waves of over 12 metres (39 feet) were reported in the Atlantic, off the coast of Nova Scotia. Several coastal roads were washed out, with boulders thrown far on shore by the pounding surf. One fish farm in Nova Scotia took $1,000,000 in damage alone, losing almost all of its catch. In eastern Quebec, up to 130\u00a0mm (5.1\u00a0in) of rain fell in Gasp\u00e9sie, Anticosti, and Eastern C\u00f4te-Nord, causing flooding in several areas.[120] In the Bas-Saint-Laurent, Sept-\u00celes and Baie-Comeau regions, it was 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) of snow that fell, causing a bus accident with 10 injuries near Saint-Simon.[120] Severe rains flooded the water treatment facility in Perc\u00e9, Quebec, leaving the city under a boil-water advisory;[121] the city was also cut from the rest of the province as the heavy rains made a short section of Quebec Route 132 unusable. In Quebec, just under 19,000 Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec customers lost power, and activity was affected at several C\u00f4te-Nord plants, including plants in the aluminum sector.[122] A major transmission line in the Minganie region was damaged by the heavy wet snow and locally freezing rain, causing blackouts and school closures.[123] One fatality related to the storm was reported in Canada when a boat capsized.[54]"

Rains and floods extended to central and eastern China during July[1][2] and were described as the worst since at least 1998.[11] According to the Ministry of Emergency Management, by the end of June flooding had displaced 744,000 people across 26 provinces with 81 people missing or dead.[3] As of 13 August, the floods have affected 63.46 million people and caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY, which are 12.7% and 15.5% higher than the 2015-2019 average, respectively. 219 people were found dead or are missing, and 54,000 houses collapsed, which is 54.8% and 65.3% lower than the 2015-2019 average, respectively.[6] The Ministry of Water Resources said that a total of 443 rivers nationwide have been flooded, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded.[12] According to statistics from the National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA), 76 key national cultural relics and 187 provincial cultural heritage sites have suffered damage of varying degrees.[citation needed] Affected regions include Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hubei, and Chongqing.[3][5][13] The regions include the upper and middle river basin of the Yangtze and its tributaries. With more rain, floods started to extend to lower regions of the Yangtze basin such as Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang.[2] Hunan, Fujian, and Yunnan were also affected."

        "content": "The local governments in recent years had made steps to implement nature-based flood mitigation strategies like tree planting, sponge cities and floodplain restoration.[18][19] Experts have noted these measures did have some positive effect as the intensity of precipitation in 2020 is much higher than the rains that caused the 1998 floods, yet the flooding has been less serious and damaging.[18] However, huge challenges in flood management and resilience remain. The Yangtze flows through some of the most productive agricultural, economic and industrial centers in China. With the rapid increase of population in China and breakneck economic growth, a large number of lakes and other wetlands had been reclaimed into farmland or urban development.[20][21] The serious shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is an important reason for the aggravation of flood disasters.[22][23][24]\nIn 1915, Dongting Lake was 5,000-square-kilometre (1,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[21] In 2000, it was only 2,625-square-kilometre (1,014\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[21] In the 1950s, Poyang Lake was 4,350-square-kilometre (1,680\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[21] In 2000, it was only 3,750-square-kilometre (1,450\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[21] Hubei was once known as \"The Province of a thousand of Lakes\".[21] In the late 1950s, there were 1,066 lakes in Hubei.[21] By the early 1980s, only 309 were left.[21][22]"

It was constructed not only for power generation but also for flood control.[1] By the end of June, the dam had started to release floodwaters.[25] While the CMA indicated flood discharge started on 29 June, satellite images suggest that floodgates were opened already five days earlier.[26] Yichang, a city below the dam, experienced extensive flooding, raising questions about the effectiveness of the flood control by the dam.[27] According to the company that manages the dam, the dam had been \"effectively reducing the speed and extent of water level rises on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze\".[28] Critics, however, suggest that the dam is \"not doing what it is designed for\" and unable to deal with severe events.[28] Other experts have pointed out that studies do show that the dam does help alleviate typical flooding during normal years and that the problem is not the design of the dam, but the public's expectation that the dam alone can solve all the problems of flooding on the Yangtze. Particularly, when significant amounts of rainfall occurred downstream of the Three Gorges Dam in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze which will never pass through the dam.[29][30] During July, three flood waves from rains in the upper Yangtze basin arrived at the dam, necessitating the opening of sluice gates multiple times to create space in the reservoir.[31] In Chinese social media it was claimed that this exacerbated downstream flooding, while the dam operators maintained that the action helped to delay floodwaters going downstream.[31] On 15 August, \"Flood #4\" passed through the Three Gorges reservoir with a maximum inflow of 62,000 cubic meters per second, the highest reached at that time during this flood season.[32] \"Flood #5\" passed the dam by 22 August when the reservoir's water level reached 167.85 metres, the highest level ever recorded.[33] According to a member of the expert committee of the state-sanctioned National Disaster Reduction Centre, the restrictions in human flow during the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China halted regular dam maintenance, dam inspection, training of officials and the construction of hydraulic projects, which were scheduled in the winter and spring of 2020.[34]"

        "content": " Hurricane Paloma was a strong late-season Atlantic hurricane that set several records for its intensity and formation. It was the sixteenth tropical storm, eighth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Paloma was, at the time, the third most powerful November hurricane on record (but has since dropped to fifth) in the Atlantic Basin, behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane, 2020's hurricanes Iota and Eta, and a tie of 1999's Hurricane Lenny, and 2001's Hurricane Michelle. Paloma also marked the first time that at least one major hurricane formed in every month of the hurricane season from July to November, with only June not having a major hurricane in the season. Paloma developed out of a strong tropical disturbance off the eastern coast of Nicaragua and northern coast of Honduras on November\u00a05. The disturbance had slowly developed into a tropical depression while hugging the coastline. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on November\u00a06, then a hurricane later that day. The next day, Paloma intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane, then soon afterward into a Category 3 major hurricane. Early on November 8, Paloma continued to intensify and reached Category 4 intensity, and then weakened rapidly into a Category 2 hurricane before making landfall in Santa Cruz del Sur, Cuba. Paloma weakened into a tropical storm on November 9 while moving over Cuba, where it stalled. It dissipated later that evening. Hurricane Paloma caused heavy damage in both the Cayman Islands and Cuba. Overall, the total damage from Paloma stands at $454.5 million, with one fatality."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "In early November 2008, an area of disturbed weather persisted over the southwestern Caribbean Sea.[1] By November 2, a surface trough manifested itself, spurring the development of scattered convection\u00a0\u2014 shower and thunderstorm activity\u00a0\u2014 across the region.[2] A tropical wave approaching from the east interacted with this trough two days later and enhanced convective organization.[3] Steadily consolidating, the system developed into a tropical depression by 18:00\u00a0UTC on November 5 while located 130\u00a0mi (215\u00a0km) southeast of the Nicaragua/Honduras border. Situated along the southwestern edge of a ridge, the depressed initially generally to the north-northwest before turning north-northeast within 12\u00a0hours of formation. Favorable environmental conditions, including low wind shear, allowed for steady intensification following cyclogenesis.[1] The HWRF and GFDL forecast models depicted rapid development of the tropical depression into a Category\u00a03 major hurricane within five days, before striking Cuba,[4] the former of which indicated a peak intensity of 131\u00a0mph (211\u00a0km/h) and 921\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.20\u00a0inHg).[5] The system acquired gale-force winds early on November 6, at which time it was assigned the name Paloma.[1] Aided by good upper-level outflow, deep convection blossomed over the storm's circulation.[5] Further development of banding features and eye resulted in Paloma rapidly intensifying into a Category 1 hurricane by 00:00\u00a0UTC on November 7.[1][6][7] The initial phase of rapid intensification temporarily abated on November 7, though slow strengthening continued. Once its eye became defined on visible satellite imagery that evening, rapid strengthening ensued once more.[1][8] A localized area of high ocean heat content bolstered this phase.[9] Aided by increasing divergence from an approaching upper-level trough, Paloma's outflow greatly enhanced overnight.[1] The aforementioned trough imparted a slightly more northeasterly track on the hurricane.[10] Around 09:00\u00a0UTC on November 8, the hurricane skirted Little Cayman as a Category\u00a03 hurricane.[11] Rapid intensification continued through the first half of the day with Paloma reaching Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) around 10:30\u00a0UTC,[12] the first such November system since Hurricane Michelle in 2001.[1] Around this time the storm's center passed over Cayman Brac and Little Cayman shortly thereafter.[13] An unofficial anemometer on Cayman Brac at an elevation of 240\u00a0ft (73\u00a0m) measured sustained winds of 151\u00a0mph (243\u00a0km/h). Based on data from reconnaissance aircraft, which found flight-level winds 163\u00a0mph (262\u00a0km/h), Paloma peaked with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 145\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) at 12:00\u201318:00\u00a0UTC, along with a minimum barometric pressure of 944\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.88\u00a0inHg).[1] This ranked the system as the third-strongest November hurricane on record, only behind the 1932 Santa Cruz del Sur hurricane and Hurricane Lenny in 1999.[14] Additionally, this marked the first time that major hurricanes developed in five separate months during a single year, with Bertha, Gustav, Ike, and Omar reaching this strength in July, August, September, and October respectively. At its peak, Paloma displayed a well-defined eye surrounded by intense convection estimated at \u221270 to \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221294 to \u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] Late on November 8, environmental conditions abruptly became hostile as the hurricane approached Cuba. Interaction with land hastened Paloma's weakening with convection diminishing significantly. The northern eyewall moved ashore around 23:00\u00a0UTC while the center itself made landfall at 01:00\u00a0UTC on November 9 near Santa Cruz del Sur. Upon moving ashore, Paloma was estimated to have had winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h), making it a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[1] Within hours of moving ashore, the center of circulation decoupled from the remaining convection and its forward speed slowed significantly.[15] The system subsequently degraded to a tropical depression by 18:00\u00a0UTC, just 24\u00a0hours after being a Category\u00a04 hurricane. With no convection redeveloping as the system drifted northward over Cuba, Paloma degenerated into a remnant low six hours later. The low then briefly moved over the Atlantic Ocean before doubling back to the southwest in response to a building ridge farther north. The system crossed Cuba again and re-emerged over the Caribbean Sea by November 12, changing direction this time to the west and later northwest. After crossing western Cuba early on November 13, the remnants of Paloma entered the Gulf of Mexico. Accelerating northward the low became decreasingly organized and ultimately dissipated early the next day about 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida.[1] Later on November 14, the system moved inland over the Florida Panhandle where a sudden burst of convective development, akin to that of supercell thunderstorms over the Great Plains, took place. Thereafter, energy from Paloma may have contributed to a storm that generated a deadly tornado outbreak in The Carolinas on November 15.[16]"

Six hours later, this was upgraded to a hurricane warning except and by the November 8, warnings covered the entirety of eastern Cuba. These advisories were discontinued following Paloma's rapid dissipation over land on November 9.[1] Fearing a \"potentially catastrophic\" storm with a storm surge of 20 to 25\u00a0ft (6.1 to 7.6\u00a0m), officials in Cuba scrambled to evacuate nearly half a million people in southern areas of the country.[21] Coincidentally, Paloma threatened the same area where a devastating hurricane in 1932 killed more than 3,000\u00a0people almost exactly 76\u00a0years prior.[22] Plans were put in place to evacuate 345,000 in Holgu\u00edn, 324,000 in Granma, 250,000\u00a0people in Las Tunas, and 200,000 in Camag\u00fcey.[21][23][24] An estimated 3,000\u00a0tourists in Ciego de Avila were brought to shelters.[21] Ultimately, an approximate 1.2\u00a0million people, 10.7% of Cuba's entire population, were relocated in advance of the storm's arrival. Of these people, 220,000\u00a0sought refuge in 1,448\u00a0shelters while the rest stayed with relatives. A total of 927\u00a0food processing centers and 72\u00a0soup kitchens opened to feed evacuees. Roughly 237,000\u00a0animals were moved to safer areas.[25] Holgu\u00edn Province was devastated by Hurricane Ike in September with many residents still homeless at the time of Paloma's approach.[26] All domestic flights except those around the Isle of Youth.[22] Former President Fidel Castro urged people to remain positive in the face of yet another hurricane that year.[27] He also issued a written statement to the United States rejecting any aid, citing anger toward the ongoing embargo of Cuba, before a formal offer was even made.[28] The non-profit organization Operation USA provided emergency aid to Cuba.[29]"

        "content": "Passing directly over the small islands Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, with a collective population of 2,695, Hurricane Paloma wrought tremendous damage. Grand Cayman escaped almost entirely unscathed. Throughout the Cayman Islands, Paloma was responsible for $154.4\u00a0million in losses of which $124.5\u00a0million was incurred from damage. This equates to roughly 7.4\u00a0percent of the territory's gross domestic product (GDP). While the overall impact to the islands was offset by a lack of damage on Grand Cayman, the localized losses on Cayman Brac and Little Cayman were tremendous. Discounting the economy of Grand Cayman, the equivalent GDP losses on the two smaller islands was likely similar to that of Hurricane Ivan in 2004, which left damage equal to 183\u00a0percent of the territory's GDP. The overall per capita impact there reached $57,925. Despite the severity of damage, no loss of life or injuries took place.[13] Destructive winds and torrential rains battered both Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, with an unofficial elevated observation station reporting maximum sustained winds of 151\u00a0mph (243\u00a0km/h) during the height of the storm. Grand Cayman saw lesser winds, with a peak sustained observation of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) at Owen Roberts International Airport. Precipitation on Cayman Brac amounted to 17.77\u00a0in (451\u00a0mm) and 6.05\u00a0in (154\u00a0mm) on Grand Cayman. A significant storm surge also impacted the islands, reaching 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) on Cayman Brac and 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) on Little Cayman.[1] Destructive winds were the primary cause of damage across Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, where nearly all homes were affected. Cayman Brac sustained the most severe impact, with 71\u00a0homes destroyed and 912\u00a0damaged. Although all home on Little Cayman were affected, none experienced major damage. Bodden Town was the only district on Grand Cayman reporting damage, with 11\u00a0homes affected. Major damage took place at Cayman Brac's seaport. The port's warehouse and office building were destroyed while anchors and moorings were shifted out of position. The island's fire station and Faith Hospital had major roof damage, with the latter resulting in significant water damage to equipment. The roof of the Seaman's Center, later determined to have been inadequately built, collapsed during the storm and nearly injured people sheltering within it. All schools on Cayman Brac suffered moderate to major damage while the primary school on Little Cayman experienced minor damage.[13] The electrical grid sustained major damage, with all residents on Cayman Brac and Little Cayman losing service. Roughly 400\u00a0power poles fell during the storm. Telecommunications experienced similar damage, with landline services disrupted for two to three weeks. Six of the ten affected Digicel sites went down. Effects on the water supply was negligible, with only a few pipes damaged by uprooted trees. Major crop damage took place on Grand Cayman, primarily to bananas, plantains, and peppers, due to high winds.[13]"

Preceded by Fay, Gustav, Hanna, and Ike, Paloma compounded damage sustained by the nation. The 2008 season is regarded as the most destructive in Cuban history, primarily due to the effects of Gustav and Ike.[43] Total damage from hurricanes that year amounted to $9.4\u00a0billion.[44] Cuban utility officials say Paloma's effect on the power grid was not as bad as the destruction caused by Gustav and Ike earlier in the season.[45] Paloma did, however knock down power and telephone lines, as well as a major communications tower. The hurricane brought with it a 14-foot (4 meter) storm surge which moved the coastline inland by almost a mile (about 1.5\u00a0km) in Santa Cruz del Sur, doing extensive damage.[46] In Santa Cruz del Sur where Paloma came ashore, 435 homes were torn to shreds. The sea swept more than a mile inland. The wind and waves left wooden houses in splinters, topped with seaweed. Two of the two-story concrete walls of a factory crumbled into piles of rubble, smashing 57 wooden fishing boats stored inside for safekeeping.[47] An estimated 328 hectares of crops were destroyed by the storm, most of which were in the process of recovery following Hurricane Ike. A total of 8,000 homes in Santa Cruz were damaged and another 670 in Camaguey and Las Tunas. About 7,000 farmers and 4,700 residences were isolated by floodwaters.[48] Overall damages in Cuba totaled to $300 million.[44]"

The Government of the Cayman Islands and the Adventist Disaster Response Agency distributed basic relief items such as tarpaulins, hygiene items and buckets to victims of the storm.[51] The overall impacts from Hurricane Paloma were reflected in the territory's GDP by a 0.9\u00a0percent decrease, worth $33\u00a0million, in the expected growth for 2008. Total revenue fell by $11.6\u00a0million while expenditures rose by $28.2\u00a0million.[nb 1] Strain on the economy prompted inflation to rise slightly above 5.2\u00a0percent for the year as well.[13] Between November 18 and December 13, 675\u00a0tons of debris was collected which covered an area of 21\u00a0acres by 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) tall.[13]"

        "content": "The January 31 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec February 3, 2021 nor'easter, also known as the 2021 Groundhog Day nor'easter,[6] was a powerful, severe, and erratic nor'easter that impacted much of the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada from February 1\u201a\u00c4\u00ec3 with heavy snowfall, blizzard conditions, strong gusty winds, storm surge, and coastal flooding.[7] The storm first developed as an extratropical cyclone off the West Coast of the United States on January 25, with the storm sending a powerful atmospheric river into West Coast states such as California, where very heavy rainfall, snowfall, and strong wind gusts were recorded, causing several hundred thousand power outages and numerous mudslides. The system moved ashore several days later, moving into the Midwest and dropping several inches of snow across the region. On February 1, the system developed into a nor'easter off the coast of the Northeastern U.S., bringing prolific amounts of snowfall to the region. Large metropolitan areas such as Boston and New York City saw as much as 18\u201a\u00c4\u00ec24 inches (46\u201a\u00c4\u00ec61\u00a0cm) of snow accumulations from January 31 to February 2, making it the worst snowstorm to affect the megalopolis since the January 2016 blizzard. It was given the unofficial name Winter Storm Orlena by The Weather Channel.[8] Several states deployed snow equipment and many winter weather alerts were issued in advance of the storm, and several major cities issued snow emergencies. The state of New Jersey and the cities of New York City and Boston declared states of emergencies ahead of the storm and cancelled in-person schools for many, and dozens of flights were cancelled as well. The storm directly caused at least six deaths and indirectly caused the death of one,[4][3][9][5] and is estimated to have caused over $1.85 billion (2021 USD) in damages.[2] The nor'easter was ranked as a Category 3 winter storm on the Regional Snowfall Index (RSI) scale."

        "content": "In late January 2021, an extratropical cyclone developed in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean, to the south of Alaska.[10][11] The system subsequently occluded and strengthened, reaching a peak intensity of 984 millibars (29.1\u00a0inHg) at 18:00\u00a0UTC on January 26, before gradually weakening, while slowly moving southeastward.[12][13] The system drew moisture northeastward from the North Central Pacific towards the West Coast of the United States in a phenomenon known as the Pineapple Express, an atmospheric river known to affect the West Coast of the United States for periods of time during the winter. The main focus of this plume of moisture was directed towards the state of California on January 26, bringing heavy amounts of rain and snow.[14][11] By 15:00\u00a0UTC, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) began issuing storm summary bulletins for the storm, as it was impacting California.[15] On January 27, the storm began moving towards the West Coast, with the storm's trough and cold front reaching the coasts of Oregon and Northern California, channeling a large atmospheric river into California in the process,[16][11] triggering a Category 2 Atmospheric River event for California (based on a scaling system devised by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography that ranks atmospheric river events from 1 to 5).[11][17] The low-pressure system responsible slowly moved eastward near the coastline, prolonging impacts until it moved inland early on January 29, in a weakened state.[18] During this time, the storm's cold front and the atmospheric river gradually moved southward, reaching Southern California by 00:00\u00a0UTC on January 29, increasing the intensity of the precipitation in the southern part of the state.[11] The storm continued moving eastward towards the Rocky Mountains while weakening, and later on January 29, the WPC terminated storm summary bulletins for the storm over the West Coast, as impacts had generally diminished.[19] The remaining energy from the storm, associated with a dip in the jet stream known as a shortwave trough, moved eastward through the mountainous terrain, helping to generate a new surface low in the early morning hours of January 30, over the state of Kansas, which eventually became the dominant low.[20][21] On January 30, The Weather Channel gave the storm the name Orlena, given its expected impacts.[7] The storm slowly deepened as it moved eastward, with precipitation, initially primarily rain, blossoming over a large area as a result. Snowfall eventually broke out within the northern part of the disturbance on January 30, as it encountered colder air over the Midwest, dropping a swath of 8\u201a\u00c4\u00ec12 inches (20\u201a\u00c4\u00ec30\u00a0cm) across the region. On January 31, with the forecast of the development of a new coastal low expected later that night, the WPC began issuing storm summary bulletins again at 15:00\u00a0UTC for the second phase of the winter storm.[22] As wintry precipitation began dissipating over the Midwest and Ohio Valley while expanding into the Mid-Atlantic states, a new area of low pressure began developing over the Carolinas as energy transferred to the coast.[23][20] This new low-pressure center soon became the dominant low in the storm. Throughout the next day on February 1, the system intensified and evolved into a nor'easter off the East Coast of the United States, as it moved northeastward, with baroclinic forcing increasing, producing intense snowbands occurring as a result \u201a\u00c4\u00ec snowfall rates approached 1\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2 inches (2.5\u201a\u00c4\u00ec5.1\u00a0cm) an hour within the mesoscale features near the New York City metro area.[24][20][25] Later that day, the storm stalled off the coast of New Jersey while the central pressure dropped to 990 millibars (29\u00a0inHg) by 12:00\u00a0UTC on February 2.[26] Competing centers of circulation elongated the system while it resumed its northeastward motion. By 12:00\u00a0UTC on February 3, the storm reached a secondary peak, at a minimum pressure of 985 millibars (29.1\u00a0inHg), as it neared Nova Scotia.[27] Afterward, the nor'easter gradually began to weaken, as it slowly moved away from the Northeastern United States; consequently, the WPC terminated storm summary bulletins at 10:00 AM EST that day (15:00 UTC), as most of the snow had tapered off in the Mid-Atlantic.[28] The storm became increasingly disorganized, with multiple areas of low pressure revolving around a broad center, with the storm briefly developing a tertiary low near the Gulf of Maine.[20][29] Weakening continued as the nor'easter moved over Eastern Canada, with the tertiary low dissipating by 00:00 UTC on February 4.[30] On February 4, the older low-pressure center became the dominant low in the storm once again, and the storm split in half, with the newer storm racing eastward across the North Atlantic.[31] Over the next day, the storm moved over Newfoundland and turned eastward, while continuing to weaken, before dissipating late on February 5.[32][33]"

Residential areas near the burn scars of wildfires from the previous year were especially at risk for flooding and mudflows.[1] Salinas received 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rainfall for the entire event causing mudflows that caused 7,000 people to evacuate. Across the State of California, the storm knocked out power to an estimated 575,000 people at one point, according to power outage tracking maps and PG&E.[67][1] In the mountainous parts of the state, the winter storm dropped tremendous amounts of heavy snow, with Mammoth Mountain Ski Area receiving 94\u00a0in (240\u00a0cm) within 72 hours, and a total of 107\u00a0in (270\u00a0cm) of snowfall for the entire event.[68] Blizzard conditions were also recorded on parts of the Sierra Nevada.[67] Very high wind gusts were also observed, with gusts over 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) observed at Alpine Meadows, peaking at 126\u00a0mph (203\u00a0km/h).[69] Heavy snowfall at Yosemite National Park forced the entire park to close for days.[70] The flooding in California was estimated to have caused over $1.75 billion (2021 USD) in damages.[2]"

At the time, the sea level was about 120 metres lower than today and the coastline stretched out as much as 35 km offshore further from its present extant. Following the Last Glacial Period, sea levels rose, reaching their present level about 7,000 years ago. The Otago Harbour was a former stream valley that was flooded during this period. During the post-glacial sea level rise, the South Dunedin plain was covered in ocean. A dune barrier was later formed between St Clair and Lawyers Head through the flow of fine sediment from the Clutha River and other smaller catchments. After the barrier formed, fine sediment accumulated in the waters at the head of the Otago Harbour, causing the sea in that area to became increasingly shallow. The gradual sediment accumulation led to the formation of a coastal wetland known as the South Dunedin plain, which also became a landbridge between the mainland South Island and the Otago Peninsula.[6]"

        "content": "At the time of European settlement during the mid-19th century, the South Dunedin plain still consisted of salt marshes, wetlands and lagoons. The local vegetation consisted of tussock, rushes and flax. Local M\u0101ori people referred to this wetland system as Kaituna (which translates as \"eating eels\") due to the significant presence of eels in the area. A shallow lagoon also terminated through the salt dunes near contemporary St Clair.[6] This flat coastal area functioned as a drainage basin for the hilly, catchment area that formed the rest of Dunedin.[1] European settlers referred to this area as \"The Flat.\" Since most of Dunedin is hilly, houses were initially built on the slopes of the extinct Dunedin Volcano. As the city's population grew during the Otago gold rush, European settlers began reclaiming swampy land in \"The Flat.\" The land was filled using sand from the coastal dunes of St Kilda. Consequently, much of South Dunedin was built on land consisting of soft, sandy sediment that was only slightly above the water table (which was up to 17 cm lower than the present day[7]).[1][8][9] During the late 19th century, marram grass was planted and sand-catching structures were also built along Ocean Beach, creating high sand dunes south of present-day Victoria Road that runs across St Kilda and St Clair. To accommodate the expansion of housing in South Dunedin, drainage of the wet lands through the dunes was blocked off to prevent storm tides from coming in through these dunes.[7][9] During the 1960s and 1970s, further land reclamation occurred between Andersons Bay Road and Portsmouth Drive through the use of dredging spoil excavated from Otago Harbour. This reclaimed land was used predominantly for commercial activity and including a pumping station on Portobello Road.[10] Land reclamation, human settlement, and the laying of asphalt and concrete for building roads and buildings in South Dunedin has disrupted the natural drainage basin by preventing water from seeping into the ground. In 2019, Stuff journalist Charlie Mitchell estimated that 60% of South Dunedin was impervious, with some pockets reporting 100%.[1]"

St Clair and Bathgate Park primary schools also sent their pupils home in response to the flooding.[14] By 12:40 pm, Pine Hill had recorded over 60mm of rain in the past 24 hours.[13] Heavy rain also caused several rivers and streams in North Otago, Dunedin, South Otago and upper Taieri Plain including the Silver Stream, Kaikorai Stream, the Water of Leith, and Lindsay Creek to rise rapidly. Flooding was reported in Kaikorai Valley road, the Gordon Road spillway, and parts of the Taieri Plain and North East Valley.[13] In addition, heavy rainfall caused leaks at several Dunedin Hospital properties, with a blocked city main causing flooding at the Hospital's Lower Ground loading dock.[13] By noon, MetService duty forecaster Emma Blake reported that 70mm of rain had fallen in coastal Otago during the morning. The meteorological service maintained a heavy rain warning for Dunedin and the Clutha District until 2am on 4 June but forecast that rain would slowly begin easing overnight. Blake forecast that Dunedin would receive a further 80 to 100 mm of rainfall.[14] The rain eased on 4 June, with Dunedin receiving a total of 175 mm of rain over the past 24 hours.

He stated that the mud tanks were full to capacity and discharging onto Dunedin's roading network.[14] On 21 June 2016, the DCC admitted during a public meeting that a faulty pumping station had made the flood in South Dunedin 20cm deeper. DCC chief executive Sue Bidrose told members of the public that the flooding was caused more by heavy rainfall than an overwhelmed stormwater system. In response, the Council had repaired the pumping station, cleared all drains and mud tanks in South Dunedin, and adopted new procedures to deal with heavy rain. Mayor Cull drew criticism for not attending the public meeting since he was visiting China. In response to allegations from the South Dunedin Action Group that the DCC was planning to abandon South Dunedin and blame it on climate change, Bidrose stated that the Council had invested NZ$5 million in the South Dunedin community hub, NZ$500,000 in a local hockey turf, and was planning to expand the local Gasworks Museum.[5] In September 2016, the DCC and Otago Regional Council (ORC) launched a series of eight public meetings to discuss the impact of the 2015 flood in South Dunedin and to discuss future planning.

In response to the report, Mayor Cull described rising sea levels as a serious issue facing South Dunedin due to its high population density and older, poorer population.[17] In response to the 2015 Otago flood, the DCC launched a series of workshops in March 2021 to seek community feedback on the future of the South Dunedin coastline between St Clair and St Kilda.[19] On 25 February 2023, Victoria University of Wellington emeritus professor of public policy Dr Jonathan Boston identified Dunedin as vulnerable to rising sea levels in the near future due to climate change. In the wake of the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods and Cyclone Gabrielle, Boston advocated a managed retreat strategy for flood-prone and low-lying areas including South Dunedin, which would involve property buyouts and cooperation between central and local governments.[20] On 23 June 2023, the DCC's South Dunedin Future programme manager Jonathan Rowe confirmed that the Council was discussing plans to deal with climate change-related challenges facing South Dunedin including rising groundwater, rising sea levels, and increased rainfall. Rowe confirmed that the DCC was considering managed retreat as an option. He clarified that it did not mean abandoning the suburb but potentially strategically evacuating from some areas and intensifying development in other areas. While St Clair Action Group co-chair Richard Egan expressed support for the DCC's planning process for South Dunedin, Ray Macleod of the Greater South Dunedin Action Group criticised managed retreat as amounting to an abandonment of the community.[21] On 5 September, Mayor of Dunedin Jules Radich confirmed that the DCC had commenced talks with the New Zealand Treasury to secure funding to purchase properties in flood-prone parts of South Dunedin as part of the Council's climate adaptation strategy.[22] On 29 November 2023, the Otago Daily Times reported that K\u0101inga Ora had paused funding for building new homes in South Dunedin due to its geographical vulnerability to flooding, erosion, and other natural hazards.[23] On 30 November, the South Dunedin Future Programme proposed 16 options for helping South Dunedin adapt to climate change including designing roads and parks to be floodable, land elevation, waterproofing the ground floor of buildings, restricting development in flood-prone areas, creating water detention basins, elevating the level of houses, and modifying drainage systems.[24]"

The railroads received warnings from points north and advised people in the area to leave the river bottoms. They moved their rolling stock and equipment to higher lands throughout the area. In the afternoon of April 6, a temporary dam around riverfront businesses in Omaha burst. During this period the Omaha Smelting Works and Union Pacific Shops almost completely submerged. The following morning floodwaters crested at 23.5 feet (7.2\u00a0m), which was two feet higher than ever recorded on the river. The Missouri had also reached a width of 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km), effectively covering all the lowlands around Omaha and Council Bluffs. On the morning of April 9, the North Western Railroad levee bounding Council Bluffs against the river broke and water spread over the west and south sections of the city. An anonymous man rode a horse through the south part of the city to warn residents when the levee gave way. Rescue shelters were placed throughout the area, with \"any building that was suitable was thrown open to the refugees.\"[4] After that event, from Ninth Street in Council Bluffs west to Omaha and from Carter Lake south beyond the Union Pacific Shops looked like \"a sea\" dotted with houses and outbuildings like islands. Boats and large sections of wooden sidewalks were pressed into service, with the operators earning from $15 to $20 (equivalent to about $630 in 2023) per day.[4] On April 12, water started receding, with railroads clearing up and repairing tracks immediately. Families returned to their homes to begin cleaning out water. However, on April 22, the river stage increased at one foot per hour, causing people again to move to higher land. This time when the river broke its banks, the water spread to Eighth Street and Broadway in Council Bluffs. Houses, trees, and livestock floated downriver.[4] By April 25, the Union Pacific Shops remained flooded as the river rose another two inches. A riverfront packinghouse and the Willow Springs Distilling Company were flooded, along with many smaller riverside businesses. 1,600 workers were unemployed at this point. In Council Bluffs 600 people were homeless, with more than a half of the city inundated with water. During the previous several weeks, the Elkhorn River valley was flooded, with the entire town of Waterloo, Nebraska abandoned due to flooding.[6] On April 27, the river began to recede and families returned to their homes. General Grenville M. Dodge, the chief engineer in charge of the construction of the Union Pacific, had employees ride through the flooded areas to rescue cattle. The river dropped 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) on the 27th.[7]"

The most important watercourse to inundate the region was the Santo Ant\u00f4nio river. According to the National Institute for Space Research, the precipitation in Rio de Janeiro was caused by a Humidity Convergence Zone,[11] a lesser form of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone. Nova Friburgo was the city most heavily affected by the floods; Teres\u00f3polis also suffered extensive damage and loss of life. In Petr\u00f3polis, the Itaipava district, an area with many luxury vacation homes, reported most casualties.

On 28 June, the Edmonton Bulletin reported the river had risen \"10 feet [3.0\u00a0m] in as many hours.\" A frantic telegram from Rocky Mountain House alerted local authorities to the flood's arrival.[2] The water rose to the deck level of the Low Level Bridge and debris was gathered along the bridge. The debris included a house swept away by the current. The Canadian Northern Railway parked a train on the bridge to hold the bridge down and try to prevent it from being swept away.[3] At the its highest point the river was estimated to have risen to over 13 metres (42\u00a0ft) above the low water level.[4] Thousands of Edmonton residents watched the flood destroy lumber mills along the city's river valley.[3][5] At the time the river valley was a hub of the city's industrial activity, including lumber and boatbuilding businesses, brick yards, coal and gold mining, and breweries, many of which were severely damaged, suffering enormous losses. No lives were lost, and no serious injuries are attributed to the flooding, but 2000 Edmontonians lost their homes, with 700 houses severely damaged and 50 swept away completely. Most of the people who lost their homes were members of Edmonton\u2019s growing working class, and could hardly afford replacing their homes and belongings. The Edmonton Bulletin estimated damage to the businesses and homes to total three-quarters of a million dollars, all without flood insurance.[4] Like all rivers, the North Saskatchewan River is subject to periodic flooding, beginning with rapid snowmelt in the mountains or prolonged periods of rain in the river basin. With the establishment of permanent communities along the river's course, and the rise of an administrative/government structure, records exist recording floods in the North Saskatchewan for the past century. The river is known to have flooded in 1830 (due to an ice dam of the flow) but the 1899 flooding of the river was the first summer-time flood of the river in known human experience or local folklore.[6] The 1915 flood peaked at about 4 metres higher than the 1899 flood. The Bighorn Dam, constructed in the early 1970s near Nordegg, Alberta, and the Brazeau Reservoir, constructed in the mid-1960s, have not reduced potential for flooding on the North Saskatchewan River.[7]"

The twenty-second officially recognized tropical cyclone of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season, Rumbia developed from an area of low pressure that developed southeast of the Ryukyu Islands on August 13. Favorable environmental conditions supported development of the low into a tropical depression by August 15. At 12:00 UTC that day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Rumbia, which refers to the Sago palm. Initially moving northward, the cyclone turned westward in response to a building ridge to its northeast while slowly strengthening, reaching its peak intensity with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) on August 16. At 20:05 UTC that day, the storm made landfall in Shanghai at peak intensity, maintaining its strength as it moved inland due to ample environmental moisture. However, Rumbia began to weaken as it continued further inland, degenerating into a tropical depression on August 17 shortly before becoming extratropical over central China. The extratropical remnants of Rumbia accelerated northeastward into the Russian Far East, where they dissipated on August 23. Rumbia, the third tropical cyclone to strike East China in 2018, succeeding tropical storms Ampil and Yagi, produced widespread heavy rainfall over regions already saturated by rains from the previous storms, causing flooding which claimed 53 lives and destroyed thousands of homes throughout the northeastern provinces of Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Xuzhou.

Disorganized convection accompanied the low, primarily south of the circulation due to strong westerly flow. Environmental conditions consisting of low wind shear, high sea surface temperatures (averaging 28 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C (82 to 84\u00a0\u00b0F)), and an anticyclone aloft favored development of the low.[2] At 06:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2]  classified the system as a tropical depression.[4] Steady development took place throughout the day with convection blossoming near the elongated circulation center.[5] Curved rain bands signified increasing organization and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert later on August\u00a014. Around 12:00\u00a0UTC, Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa\u2014roughly 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) north of the system's estimated center\u2014recorded sustained winds of 37\u00a0km/h (23\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 998\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.47\u00a0inHg).[6] The JMA subsequently analyzed the system as a tropical storm at 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015\u2014the eighteenth tropical storm of the season. Accordingly, the storm was assigned the name Rumbia.[7][nb 3] At the same time, the JTWC designated Rumbia as Tropical Depression 21W.[9] Throughout August\u00a015, Rumbia moved slowly northwest in response to a subtropical ridge to the northeast.[10] Intensification was slow to occur as convection remained disorganized, primarily active to the south and east of the center. Accordingly, the strongest winds were displaced well east of the center within this convection.[11] The outlying convection remained strong due to ample upper-level outflow. An upper-level trough suppressed convection over and west of the center, leaving the circulation exposed.[12] Early on August\u00a016 Rumbia's trajectory shifted west-northwest, bringing the expected track toward Shanghai, China.[13] The upper-level environment became more conducive to development throughout August\u00a016, with improved outflow supporting development of convection over Rumbia's center.[14] A nascent eye feature surrounded by deep convection became evident later that day, marking intensification of the system.[15] Based on JMA analysis, Rumbia reached its peak intensity around 15:00\u00a0UTC just east of Shanghai with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 985\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.09\u00a0inHg).[16] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, a ship near the mouth of Hangzhou Bay reported sustained winds of 78\u00a0km/h (48\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 986\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.12\u00a0inHg) within the cyclone's center. Based on Dvorak satellite estimates ranging from T2.5 to T3.5 (indicating one-minute sustained winds of 65 to 100\u00a0km/h (40 to 65\u00a0mph)), the JTWC analyzed Rumbia to have achieved one-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) at this time.[15] Shortly after reaching peak intensity over the Hangzhou Bay on August 16, Rumbia made landfall over Pudong New Area, Shanghai, China around 20:05\u00a0UTC, becoming the third tropical storm to hit the city in 2018.[17] Despite moving over land, ample atmospheric moisture and low wind shear enabled Rumbia to maintain its strength as it progressed inland.[18] Banding features maintained their structure through the first half of August\u00a017.[19]"

Widespread torrential rains affected provinces unaccustomed to significant typhoon impacts: northern Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Xuzhou. The floods are considered the worst typhoon-related floods in the country since 2016. Throughout the affected areas, 53\u00a0people died in storm-related incidents. More than 32,246\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed and total economic losses reached \u00a536.91 billion (US$5.36\u00a0billion).[24] In Shanghai where the storm made landfall, a minor storm surge of 0.3 to 0.9\u00a0m (0.98 to 2.95\u00a0ft) impacted the coast. Rainfall peaked at 183\u00a0mm (7.2\u00a0in) in the Jiading District resulting in some flooding which affected three homes, twelve cars, and ninety-eight roads. Damage to power lines cut power to 40,000\u00a0people, primarily in the Chongming District.[21] Multiple rivers and lakes in Jiangsu reached flood level due to the heavy rains, particularly Lake Tai, the Qinhuai River, and the Wei River.

Flooding destroyed 1,486\u00a0homes, damage 5,844\u00a0more, and submerged 268,770\u00a0hectares (664,000\u00a0acres) of crops.[26][27] Twelve people died and total economic losses in the province reached \u00a51.837\u00a0billion (US$267\u00a0million).[27] The impacts are considered the worst from a typhoon in the province since Typhoon Haikui in 2012.[26] In neighboring Hunan province, approximately 4.9\u00a0million people were affected, of whom 9,114\u00a0were rendered homeless. Hundreds of homes suffered varying degrees of damage while 85\u00a0collapsed. Flooding primarily affected eastern counties near the Anhui\u2013Hunan border.[28] Unusually heavy rains persisted as far north as Liaoning Province;up to 288\u00a0mm (11.3\u00a0in) fell across the Liaodong Peninsula. Hourly accumulations peaked at 50 to 70\u00a0mm (2.0 to 2.8\u00a0in) and minor street flooding occurred in many areas.[29] Two tornadoes touched down in Xuzhou.[18]"

It moved ashore near Hailing Island, Yangjiang, Guangdong Province at 10:35\u00a0a.m. CST on August 11 (02:35 UTC).[6] The depression made an anti-clockwise loop inland and moved back to the sea later that day.[7] The system moved slowly southeastward, because Yagi and Leepi in the northwestern Pacific prohibited the extension of the subtropical ridge, therefore the steering current remained weak for days in the South China Sea.[8] After moving back to the sea, the depression gained some organization, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) finally classified it as a tropical depression and gave the numerical designation 20W on August 12.[9] After maintaining tropical depression status for more than 3 days, 20W finally intensified to a tropical storm and the JMA gave the international name Bebinca early on August 13.[10] Throughout that day, Bebinca's low-level circulation center (LLCC) was exposed because of moderate to strong easterly wind shear. Despite this, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm later that day.[11] Bebinca remained a sheared cyclone on August 14, while continued to slowly drifting to the east.[12] After Leepi made landfall in Japan and dissipated, the subtropical ridge can finally extend and build over China, and Bebinca began to curve back to the west.[7] Although wind shear remained strong on August 15, Bebinca still began to intensify as it was situated over very warm waters with 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F), and the system was able to develop a central dense overcast.[13] Bebinca made its second landfall in Leizhou, Guangdong at 9:40\u00a0p.m. CST (13:40 UTC), and emerged to the Gulf of Tonkin about four hours later.[14] Once moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, Bebinca began another intensification trend. This prompted the JMA to upgrade Bebinca to a severe tropical storm, but it was revoked in the post-storm analysis.[15] Bebinca weakened slightly before making its third and final landfall in T\u0129nh Gia District, Thanh H\u00f3a Province, Vietnam at 5:30\u00a0a.m. ICT on August 17 (22:30 UTC on August 16), with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[16] Bebinca weakened quickly once moving inland, and the JTWC issued its final warning early on August 17.[17] The JMA also downgraded Bebinca to a tropical depression,[18] and Bebinca dissipated later that day, over Laos."

The JTWC monitored Marcia again on 22 February and claimed that the system had become subtropical with gale-force sustained winds, when sea surface temperature (SST) was approximately 25\u00a0\u00b0C; moreover, satellite imageries also revealed a broad, exposed low-level circulation centre (LLCC) with deep convection displaced over the southeast periphery of the LLCC.[22] Although it drifted northwards over warmer SST later, it was failed to intensify but weakened further. On 27 February, Marcia entered the responsible area of the Fiji Meteorological Service as a weak low-pressure system.[23][24] The remnants were completely absorbed into a trough on 1 March.[25][26]"

The Bureau was criticised for continuing to report the ADT estimates after lower actual windspeeds had been recorded, by biologist and blogger Jennifer Marohasy of Central Queensland University.[36] The International Wind Hazard Damage Assessment Group also expressed concern, saying \"A community that receives an over-represented wind speed report may have potential for complacency in preparation or building standards in the future.\"[27] BOM rejected the criticism, stating that Middle Percy Island was not located in the region of highest windspeed.  The equipment there had also been destroyed by the storm, cutting off the data flow.  Bureau chief Robb Webb also rejected claims BOM had relied solely on modelling, noting that the bureau worked with the US Joint Typhoon Warning Center to predict the storm's strength.

        "content": " Pacific Northwest windstorms, sometimes colloquially known as Big Blows,[1]  are extratropical cyclones which form in the Pacific basin, and affect land areas in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and British Columbia, Canada. They form as cyclonic windstorms associated with areas of low atmospheric pressure that track across the North Pacific Ocean towards western North America. Deep low pressure areas are relatively common over the North Pacific. They are most common in the winter months. On average, the month when most windstorms form is November or December. The closest analogue to these storms are European windstorms, which develop over the eastern portion of the North Atlantic Ocean as opposed to the North Pacific.[2] Nor'easters, a similar class of extratropical cyclones, commonly affect the east coast of North America. While the storms on the East Coast are named \"nor'easters\", the Pacific Northwest windstorms are not called \"nor'westers\" because the cyclones' primary winds can blow from any direction, while the primary winds in nor'easters usually blow from the northeast.[3]"

By 27 January 2020, the rain had largely subsided but was expected to continue throughout the week.[2]\nIn the state of Minas Gerais, more than 15,000 people were evacuated as a result of the heavy rain and subsequent flooding. 10,000 people were evacuated from Espirito Santo along with 6,000 people from Rio de Janeiro. The city of Belo Horizonte saw 171\u00a0mm (6.7\u00a0in) of rainfall within a 24-hour period on 23\u201324\u00a0January; this was the highest such measurement in 110 years.[2] Flooding in the city was reported on 29 January and led to the collapse of the roof of a mall.[11] Reports emerged of several collapsed bridges and damaged roads in rural parts of Minas Gerais.[12] Over 100 cities across the three states declared a state of emergency. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro announced the deployment of the Brazilian Armed Forces to the affected regions. Governor of Minas Gerais Romeu Zema stated that the hardest-hit areas were in areas where \"people lived in informal and precarious housing\". The Brazilian federal government allocated US$20 million for relief efforts in the affected regions while the state government of Minas Gerais allocated up to US$80\u00a0million.[13][14] The United Nations offered its assistance and support to the Brazilian government.[15] On 30 January, President Bolsonaro visited affected parts of Minas Gerais.[16] The large coffee fields of Minas Gerais were largely unaffected by the flooding, according to farmers. Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer.[12] The town of Sabar\u00e1 established vaccination points against Hepatitis A and tetanus in the city, which was heavily hit by the flooding.[17] Heavy rainfall continued into February and spread towards parts of neighbouring Paraguay. The southern Brazilian regions of Paran\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul had the highest risks of flooding.[18]"

On January 25, a tropical disturbance formed within the Fijian Archipelago and was designated as Tropical Disturbance 12F. The next day it was upgraded to a tropical depression, whilst on January 27, RSMC Nadi named the depression as Cyclone Gene. Later that day Gene made landfall on Fiji, and caused 8 deaths and $51 million (2008, F$). Cyclone Gene then slowly intensified to a category three cyclone on both the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale and the Australian Cyclone Intensity Scale. Gene then took a turn to the south moving towards 25\u00b0S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility with the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. Gene then crossed 25\u00b0S on February 3 and Nadi released their final advisory. Cyclone Gene continued as a Tropical Cyclone for three days before becoming an extratropical cyclone. Early on February 6 TCWC Wellington released their final advisory on tropical cyclone Gene as they declared it as extratropical. Cyclone Gene caused widespread damage to several of Fiji's main islands, including Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni, Yasawa, Mamanuca, and other outlying island groups, while killing a total of 8 people. The cyclone also caused severe damage to Vanautu's Futuna island after its outer bands lashed the island with gale force windspeeds and heavy rain for 12 hours."

As Gene crossed in to TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility, Cyclone Gene started to re-intensify becoming a severe tropical cyclone again with peak winds of 120\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph 10 min) however this re-intensification only lasted for 12 hours before Gene began to weaken for the final time by becoming a tropical cyclone that day.[8][9] Gene slowly weakened over the next couple of days as it moved towards the south east.[8] The JTWC then issued its final warning on February 6 as Cyclone Gene was finishing its extratropical transition, and had also become fully embedded within the baroclinic zone.[10] TCWC Wellington continued to monitor the extratropical remnants of Gene until February 9, after the sustained windspeeds had dropped to below 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[8]"

On Mota Lava and Rah Island, as well as Gaua, bungalows, resorts, and restaurants along the coast were either washed away or inundated by sea flooding, according to their provincial council reports. Most schools in the Torba and Penama provinces sustained major damages to classrooms and other semi-permanent structures, while other buildings had their roofs ripped off.

Numerous windows were broken on the ship as it was tossed around by the waves. Water poured into passengers rooms through broken windows, causing panic throughout the ship. Five people were injured, one of whom sustained a broken rib after falling out of bed when a wave hit the ship. The bar area of the ship was reportedly significantly damaged and dishes and glasses were shattered in the kitchen.[11] The remnants of Funa produced high winds in the North Island of New Zealand which knocked down numerous trees, cutting power to 16,000\u00a0residents on the island. Downed power lines sparked several fires.[12] Waves up to 5\u00a0m (16.4\u00a0ft) impacted coastal regions of New Zealand, forcing boaters to remain in port.[13] Upwards of 300\u00a0mm (11.8\u00a0in) of rain fell across parts of New Zealand and gale-force winds fanned brushfires.[14] The World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee later retired the name Funa from the South Pacific naming lists and replaced it with Fotu.[15][16]"

Cyclone Daman was the fourth tropical depression and the first severe tropical cyclone to form east of longitude 180\u00b0 during the 2007\u201308 South Pacific cyclone season. Due to the severity of the storm, the name Daman was retired and replaced with Denia. On December\u00a03, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, upgraded a tropical disturbance, located to the west of the Solomon Islands, to Tropical Depression 04F. On December\u00a05, as the depression moved towards the west into the Fijian archipelago, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and RSMC Nadi upgraded it to Cyclone Daman. On December\u00a07 the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 185\u00a0km/h, (115\u00a0mph 10-minute sustained) which made Daman a Category 4 cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. Later that day Daman also reached its peak intensity by 1-minute means with winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) which made it a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Early on December\u00a08, Cyclone Daman brushed by the Fijian island of Cikobia-i-Lau, causing damage to housing, crops and vegetation. Daman then weakened the next day into a tropical depression and dissipated on December\u00a010."

At that time RSMC Nadi forecasted, that there was a possibility that Daman could become a category five severe tropical cyclone, with windspeeds of 215\u00a0km/h, (130\u00a0mph), within 12 hours. However six hours later as the general organization of the eye had weakened, RSMC Nadi reported that the cyclone had peaked as a category four severe tropical cyclone with ten-minute winds of 195\u00a0km/h, (120\u00a0mph) and a peak pressure of 925\u00a0hPa (27.3\u00a0inHg). The JTWC also reported that Cyclone Daman had peaked with one-minute winds of 195\u00a0km/h, (120\u00a0mph). In their post storm analysis, both RSMC Nadi and the JTWC revised their estimated peak windspeeds, with RSMC Nadi lowering their estimated windspeeds to 185\u00a0km/h, (115\u00a0mph), while the JTWC elevated their estimates to 205\u00a0km/h, (125\u00a0mph).[6] As the Cyclone peaked in intensity, it started to accelerate towards the southeast and passed over or close to Thikombia island, before becoming under the influence of a mid-level ridge of high pressure. As it came under the influence of the mid-level ridge of high pressure, Daman turned once more and started to move slowly towards the southeast, into an area of strengthening vertical windshear and cooler sea surface temperatures. As a result, Daman rapidly weakened during December 8, before both the next day as the system moved through the Lau Islands, both the JTWC and RSMC Nadi reported that it had weakened into a tropical depression.[3][6] The final advisories on the system were issued the next day as Daman merged with a frontal system.[3][6]"

This led to several international and domestic flights being canceled on December 7.[14] The Fijian island of Cikobia received a direct hit whilst Daman passed directly over Rotuma.[15] The total cost to Fiji from Cyclone Daman was\nF$500,000 (2007) ($330,000 US$2007) with no damage being reported in Tonga from the storm.[3][16] Daman did most of its damages on Cikobia island, which has a population of around 120. Damage on Cikobia included extensive damages to houses, school buildings, crops, fruitbearing trees and foliage. Water pipes were damaged by fallen trees as a result of high winds from the storm. Despite initial fears of there being some fatalities on Cikobia, no loss of life was recorded due to the storm.[17] This was because the islands 120 residents had evacuated to caves on Cikobia.[17] The Fijian Dependency of Rotuma experienced a significant amount of rainfall from December 5 until December 7, when Cyclone Daman was located near Rotuma.[18] Because there were no deaths and only 65 people had been directly affected by Cyclone Daman, the Fijian government, with the help of the Red Cross, decided not to request any International Aid or any external assistance.[19] The Fijian Government, on January 15, 2008, allocated $530,000 2008\u00a0FJD for the relief and rehabilitation programme of Cikobia.[20] By August 2008, all work rebuilding Cikobia after Cyclone Daman had been completed.[21] Due to the impact of this system, the name Daman was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization.[22]"

Of those five tropical cyclones, two of them intensified into a hurricane, with one strengthening into a major hurricane (category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.) Two tropical depressions developed in the month of June, both of which caused negligible damage. A tropical storm in July brought minor damage to Pensacola, Florida, but devastated a fleet of ships. Another two tropical depressions formed in August, the first of which brought rainfall to the Lesser Antilles. The most intense tropical cyclone of the season was the Florida Keys hurricane. Many deaths occurred after ships capsized in Bahamas, the Florida Keys, and Cuba. Strong winds left about $2\u00a0million in damage in Key West. After crossing the Gulf of Mexico, severe impact was reported in Texas, especially the Corpus Christi area. Overall, the hurricane caused 828\u00a0fatalities and $22\u00a0million in damage, $20\u00a0million of which was inflicted in Texas alone. Three other tropical cyclones developed in September, including two tropical storms and one tropical depression, all of which left negligible impact on land. The final tropical system of the season also did not affect land and became extratropical on November\u00a015. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 55,[1] slightly below the 1911\u20131920 average of 58.7.[2] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

By September\u00a05, the storm headed northward toward the southeastern Bahamas. The system crossed Mayaguana and began curving northwestward. Early on September\u00a07, the storm strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, while curving just north of due west.

Additionally, large vessels that were firmly secured were torn loose from their mooring and beached. Overall, three people drowned and damage reached approximately $2\u00a0million. The Spanish steamship SS Valbanera sank offshore Havana, Cuba, presumably drowning all 488\u00a0passengers and crewmen. In Texas, storm surge and tidal waves resulted in severe damage. Some 23\u00a0blocks of homes were destroyed or swept away in Corpus Christi. In the city alone, 284\u00a0bodies were recovered and damage was conservatively estimated at $20\u00a0million. In Matagorda, Palacios, and Port Lavaca, wharves, fish houses, and small boats were significantly impacted.

Approved projects include artistic performances and exhibitions, educational programs, garden and tea parties, geocaching programs, military parades, summer reading programs, and tree-planting events.[329] Funded initiatives aim to educate Canadians about the role of the Canadian Crown and celebrate Canadian achievements over the past seven decades.[330] The Platinum Jubilee was the first publicly celebrated jubilee in which the Canadian government didn't issue a jubilee medal. Responding to queries about the medal, Canadian Heritage noted the decision to not issue a medal was \"an approach consistent with that adopted by almost all Commonwealth realms\".[331] However, the decision was criticised by the Royal Canadian Legion and the Monarchist League of Canada, the latter also criticising the scale of the federal government's planning for the event.[332][333] Several provincial governments instituted their own Jubilee medals, with Alberta and Saskatchewan issuing 7,000 medals each;[334][335] Nova Scotia issuing 5,000 medals;[336] Manitoba issuing 1,000 medals;[337] New Brunswick issuing 3000 medals;[338] and Prince Edward Island issuing 584 medals.[339] The same legislative act that authorized Alberta's Platinum Jubilee medals also replaced awards created for the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002, with platinum jubilee equivalents and increased their monetary prizes.[334] The government of Ontario stated it would celebrate the anniversary through the province's existing honours and medals, as well as issuing commemorative Platinum Jubilee lapel pins.[340] The government of Manitoba provided grant funding with a focus on reconciliation to Manitoba's six Royally-designated organizations[n 2] to facilitate jubilee initiatives throughout the year.[341]"

Tobacco seeds were provided to viceregal offices and commissioners from plants grown for the Chapel Royal at Massey College. Another garden to represent the Crown's association with indigenous Canadians was unveiled at Mount Pleasant Nature Park in the County of Brant on 4 June.[388] The Prince Edward Island Crown-in-Council established a tree planting initiative to create a legacy for the jubilee by adding a stream to its Greening Spaces Program and,[389] from Earth Day to 7 June, the town of Saint Andrews, New Brunswick, planted 70 trees.[390] In May, members of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets also planted trees as a part of the Queen's Green Canopy project.[329] A commemorative plaster sculpture honouring the Queen's 70-year reign was put on display in the Senate of Canada Building.

Particularly affected was the North Sea coast of Jutland, Slesvig and Germany. The sand spit Agger Tange was broken through, and the Limfjord got its western opening to the sea. Henceforth, North Jutland has been an island. In North Frisia, the unprotected islets, known as Halligen, were hit. Many dykes had already been damaged in November the year before by a severe storm surge. The island of Pellworm was completely flooded. In East Frisia, the town of Emden was particularly hard hit. However, because the levees in the East Frisian area had been raised significantly in many places in the preceding years, the number of casualties, about 200, was smaller than it might have otherwise been. In the Netherlands, the February flood was the worst natural disaster of the 19th century. Most of the dead and the worst damage occurred in Groningen, Friesland and Overijssel. The reaction at national level was quite similar to that during the Flood of 1953,[1] but the former event was surprisingly quickly forgotten once the damage had been repaired and had no political or engineering consequences. The disaster of 1953 finally allowed a law on Delta Works to be passed for a significant improvement of coastal protection. The flood has been recorded in the Diary of Jan Kruys, by the first Mayor of the town of Vriezenveen, Overijssel (1767-1830): \"The 4th and 5th of this month have been disastrous for numerous residents of this province, as well as many others abroad. People and cattle have drowned, especially in the towns around the South Sea, like Elburg, Kampen, Mastenbroek etc. The government has taken measures to support the victims.\" The Groningen epidemic of 1826, probably caused by a rare outbreak of malaria tropica, was partly the result of the extensive floods and has also been described by Jan Kruys in his diary.[2]"

Also known as hurricanes, typhoons, or other names, tropical cyclones have caused significant destruction and loss of human life, resulting in about 2\u00a0million deaths since the 19th century. Powerful cyclones that make landfall \u2013 moving from the ocean to over land \u2013 are some of the most impactful, although that is not always the case. An average of 86\u00a0tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones, super typhoons, or major hurricanes (at least of Category 3 intensity). In Africa, tropical cyclones can originate from tropical waves generated over the Sahara Desert, or otherwise strike the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa. Cyclone Idai in March 2019 hit central Mozambique, becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record in Africa, with 1,302\u00a0fatalities, and damage estimated at US$2.2\u00a0billion.[nb 1] R\u00e9union island, located east of Southern Africa, experiences some of the wettest tropical cyclones on record. In January 1980, Cyclone Hyacinthe produced 6,083\u00a0mm (239.5\u00a0in) of rain over 15\u00a0days, which was the largest rain total recorded from a tropical cyclone on record. In Asia, tropical cyclones from the Indian and Pacific oceans regularly affect some of the most populated countries on Earth. In 1970, a cyclone struck Bangladesh, then known as East Pakistan, producing a 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) storm surge that killed at least 300,000\u00a0people; this made it the deadliest tropical cyclone on record. In October 2019, Typhoon Hagibis struck the Japanese island of Honshu and inflicted US$15\u00a0billion in damage, making it the costliest storm on record in Japan. The islands that comprise Oceania, from Australia to French Polynesia, are routinely affected by tropical cyclones. In Indonesia, a cyclone struck the island of Flores in April 1973, killing 1,653\u00a0people, making it the deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the Southern Hemisphere. Atlantic and Pacific hurricanes regularly affect North America. In the United States, hurricanes Katrina in 2005 and Harvey in 2017 are the country's costliest ever natural disasters, with monetary damage estimated at US$125\u00a0billion. Katrina struck Louisiana and destroyed much of the city of New Orleans, while Harvey caused significant flooding in southeastern Texas after it dropped 60.58\u00a0in (1,539\u00a0mm) of rainfall; this was the highest rainfall total on record in the country. Europe is rarely affected by tropical cyclones; however, the continent regularly encounters storms after they transitioned into extratropical cyclones. Only one tropical depression \u2013 Vince in 2005 \u2013 struck Spain, and only one subtropical cyclone \u2013 Subtropical Storm Alpha in 2020 \u2013 struck Portugal. Occasionally, there are tropical-like cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea. The northern portion of South America experiences occasional tropical cyclones, with 173\u00a0fatalities from Tropical Storm Bret in August 1993. The South Atlantic Ocean is generally inhospitable to the formation of a tropical storm. However, in March 2004, Hurricane Catarina struck southeastern Brazil as the first hurricane on record in the South Atlantic Ocean."

The storm killed 109\u00a0people in Mozambique, 73\u00a0people in Eswatini, and 60\u00a0people in South Africa.[21][22][23] 2000 was the first year on record in which two tropical cyclones of hurricane intensity struck Mozambique.

Eline also killed 12 people in Zimbabwe and 21 people in South Africa. The storm was followed weeks later by Cyclone Hudah, which killed three people in Mozambique.[24] The only other year to feature tropical cyclone landfalls in the country was 2019. In March 2019, Cyclone Idai hit central Mozambique, becoming the second-deadliest tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere, and the deadliest on record in Africa. Across southern Africa, Idai killed 1,302\u00a0people \u2013 and affected more than 3\u00a0million others. Total damages from Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, and Malawi were estimated to be at least $2.2\u00a0billion (2019 USD).[25][26] About a month later, Cyclone Kenneth became the strongest tropical cyclone on record to strike Mozambique, when it moved ashore just north of Pemba. The JTWC estimated landfall winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). Kenneth killed 45\u00a0people in Mozambique, less than two months after Idai's deadly trek through the region.[27][28][29]"

Most of the island is susceptible to flooding from tropical cyclones, with the northern portion of the country most likely to experience a significant storm surge. Toamasina, located in east-central Madagascar, is the most likely area to experience tropical cyclone damage.[53] In March 1927, a tropical cyclone struck eastern Madagascar, killing at least 500\u00a0people.[54] On March\u00a07, 2004, Cyclone Gafilo made landfall in northeastern Madagascar just south of Antalaha as a very intense tropical cyclone, making it one of the strongest cyclones on record to hit the country. Gafilo killed 363 people in the country and left $250 million in damage (2004 USD).

In 1973, Tropical Storm Christine developed over the country of Guinea.[63] In August 2015, Hurricane Fred formed just off the coast of Guinea, and it soon became the easternmost hurricane in the tropical Atlantic. Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in Senegal. Fred was the first hurricane to move through Cape Verde since 1892.[64][65][66] Other deadly storms in Cape Verde include Tropical Storm Beryl in 1982 which killed three people, Tropical Storm Fran in 1984, which killed at least 29\u00a0people, and Hurricane Debbie in 1961, which caused a plane crash that killed 60\u00a0people.[21][67] Although Western Africa is rarely affected directly by tropical cyclones, the extratropical remnants of Tropical Storm Delta in 2005 struck Morocco.[68] Tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic Ocean are unusual; however, a possible tropical storm formed west of Angola in April 1991.[69][70]"

This made it the deadliest tropical cyclone on record.[87] The cyclone wrecked about 400,000\u00a0houses, 99,000\u00a0boats, and 3,500\u00a0schools. The local government's lack of response to the storm was a partial factor in the Bangladesh Liberation War, one of the first instances in which a natural disaster led to a civil war.[88] After the storm, Bangladesh instituted a Cyclone Preparedness Programme to better inform residents of approaching storms, construct more shelters, and restore coastal mangrove forests to mitigate storm surge flooding.[5] Another powerful cyclone struck the country in 1991, killing 138,000\u00a0people and displacing around 10\u00a0million people homeless, with more than 1\u00a0million homes destroyed.[89] In 2007, a similarly strong Cyclone Sidr struck the country, killing 3,406\u00a0people. The reduced death toll, compared to the 1970 and 1991 storm, was partially due to the improved warning systems and more shelters.[90]"

A ship, the Crest of the Wave, recorded a minimum pressure of 880\u00a0mbar (26\u00a0inHg), making it a Category\u00a05 on the Australian region tropical cyclone scale and one of the most intense tropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere. The intense cyclone produced the largest recorded storm surge worldwide, estimated at 13\u00a0m (43\u00a0ft), which washed more than 800\u00a0m (0.50\u00a0mi) inland. Mahina killed at least 307\u00a0people, most of them due to 54\u00a0shipwrecks.[172][173] According to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, one of the country's most significant tropical cyclones was Cyclone Tracy in 1974, which killed 71\u00a0people in Northern Territory. Early on December\u00a025 (local time), Cyclone Tracy struck the territory capital of Darwin, where it produced a wind gust of 217\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) before the anemometer at the airport failed. The cyclone damaged or destroyed 80% of the buildings in the town, forcing 75% of the town's residents to evacuate, resulting in Australia's largest ever peacetime evacuation.[174][175] The total cost of the storm damage and reconstruction was estimated at over $500\u00a0million (1974\u00a0AUD).[176] Australia's costliest tropical cyclone was Cyclone Yasi, which struck Mission Beach, Queensland on February\u00a03, 2011, as a Category\u00a05 on the Australian region tropical cyclone scale. The cyclone left about US$2.8\u00a0billion in damage.[177][178] On average, two tropical cyclones make landfall in Western Australia each year, of which one is a severe tropical cyclone. The earliest landfall in a season was in 1910, when a tropical cyclone struck Broome on November\u00a019. The latest landfall in a season was in 1988, when Cyclone Herbie struck Shark Bay on May\u00a021. Early-season cyclones tend to affect the Kimberley and Pilbara in the northern part of the state, while late season storms tend to affect regions farther south.[179] The highest wind gust recorded worldwide occurred during Cyclone Olivia in 1996. On April\u00a010, the cyclone passed near Barrow Island before moving ashore Western Australia near Mardie. A station on the island recorded a wind gust of 408 kilometres per hour (254\u00a0mph), breaking the worldwide wind gust record of 372\u00a0km/h (231\u00a0mph), set on Mount Washington in the United States in April 1934.[180][181]"

It is planned to be the first 1-kilometre-tall (3,281\u00a0ft) building and would be the world's tallest building or structure upon completion, standing 180\u00a0m (591\u00a0ft) taller than the Burj Khalifa.[11][12] Located in the north side of Jeddah, it is the centrepiece of the Jeddah Economic City project. After almost five years of inactivity, development work on the project resumed in 2023.[13] The design, created by American architect Adrian Smith, who also designed the Burj Khalifa, incorporates many unique structural and aesthetic features. The creator and leader of the project is Saudi Arabian prince Al-Waleed bin Talal,[14] a grandson of Ibn Saud, and nephew of the Kings of Saudi Arabia after Ibn Saud. Al-Waleed is the chairman of Kingdom Holding Company (KHC), which is a partner in the Jeddah Economic Company (JEC), which was formed in 2009 for the development of Jeddah Tower and City.[15] Progress towards construction was halted in January 2018, when building owner JEC stopped structural concrete work. At the time, the tower was about one-third of the way completed. The development halt stemmed from labor problems with a contractor following the 2017\u20132019 Saudi Arabian purge. No firm timeline for completion has been provided,[16] but in September 2023, a new request for proposals was issued to a multinational group of construction firms to complete the project.[17]"

The three-phase project was proposed for a large area of undeveloped waterfront land with an area of 5.2\u00a0km2 (2.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[20] The area is located roughly 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) north of the port city of Jeddah. Jeddah Economic City was designed by HOK Architects,[21] and is estimated to cost at least SR75\u00a0billion (US$20\u00a0billion) and take around ten\u00a0years to build.[22] The development is envisioned to grow into a new district of Jeddah.[23] The second phase of the project will be the infrastructure development needed to support the city, and the third phase has not yet been revealed.[24] The focal point of the development and Jeddah Tower's primary use will be to house a Four Seasons hotel, Four Seasons short-rental apartments, Class A office space, and luxury condominiums. The tower will also have the world's highest observation deck.[25] Although the Jeddah Economic City plot is nearly isolated from the current urban core of Jeddah, no land tracts of such size were available closer to the city.[24] Northward is generally considered the direction in which the city will spread in the future. The primary designer of Jeddah Tower is Chicago-based architect Adrian Smith of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture (AS + GG),[12] the same architect who designed the Burj Khalifa while at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM),[26] where he worked for almost 40 years.[27] AS + GG was formed in 2006 by Adrian Smith, Gordon Gill, and Robert Forest.[28] The development of the tower is being managed by Emaar Properties PJSC.[29] Thornton Tomasetti has been selected as the structural engineering firm,[30] and Environmental Systems Design, Inc. (ESD)[31] is a part of the AS + GG design team that serves as the building services engineering consultants.[32] On 2 August 2011, it was publicly announced by Kingdom Holding, the investment company, that a contract had been signed by Saudi Binladin Group (SBG), that construction was going to start soon, and that the tower was expected to take 63 months to complete.[33][34][35] While the official construction estimate is five years and three months (63 months), others calculate that it will take significantly longer, over seven years, based on the duration of Burj Khalifa's construction,[36] which was over six years (with the help of CQC Department). Besix Group (Belgian Six Construct), which constructed the Burj Khalifa, was previously considered for the contract, but did not win, partially because SBG invested in Jeddah Economic Company (JEC),[37] contributing SR1.5\u00a0billion (US$400\u00a0million) towards the development of the project.[38] Besix admitted in 2010 that they expected Binladin Group to win the contract.[39] Jeddah Economic Company is a closed joint stock company (PJSC) formed in 2009 as a financial entity for Jeddah Tower and Jeddah Economic City. It is made up primarily of financiers (stakeholders) Kingdom Holding Company (33.35%), Abrar Holding Company (33.35%), which is owned by Samaual Bakhsh and businessman Abdulrahman Hassan Sharbatly (16.67%), as well as the tower's own contractor, Saudi Binladin Group (16.63%).[40] JEC's assets have a book value of nearly SR9\u00a0billion, broken down between a land bank of over 5,300,000\u00a0m2 (57,048,725\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) (the Jeddah Economic City plot) with a value of SR7.3\u00a0billion that will be used as collateral to attain bank loans, and SR1.5\u00a0billion in cash.[24] Kingdom Holding is an investment company founded in 1980 and 95% owned by Al-Waleed bin Talal[41] that has assets valued at over $25\u00a0billion, with interests in many major companies such as Walt Disney, PepsiCo, Kodak, Apple, Hewlett Packard, Motorola, Time Warner, Newscorp, Pinnacle Infotech Solutions, and Citigroup, as well as real estate in London through its Songbird Estates division.[42]"

In August 2011, the start of construction was slated as \"no later than December.\"[45] This meant the tower was expected to be completed in 2017, though at that time it was also possible that it could still have been completed by the date the media continued to publish, which was the prior estimate of late 2016.[46] Only if construction had begun promptly and gone smoothly could completion in late 2016 have been achieved.[21] Reports in 2009 suggested that the project had been put on hold due to the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 and that Bechtel (the initial engineering firm for this project) was \"in the process of ending its involvement with the project.\"[47][48] Kingdom Holding Company quickly criticized the news reports, insisting that the project had not been shelved.[49]"

Furthermore, the Pearl River Tower is a unique tower that was originally designed to use zero net energy by drawing all its needed power from wind, sunlight, and geothermal mass,[27] though this design goal was not fully achieved.[55] In October 2010, the owners (Kingdom Holding Company) signed a development agreement with Emaar Properties PJSC. The final height of the building was questionable, but it was still listed to be over 1 kilometre.[56] Kingdom Holding said construction was progressing.[26][57] Designs for the foundation were in place by early August 2011 and the contract for the piling was tendered.[58] On 16 August 2011, Langan International officially announced their involvement and that the foundation and piling had to be uniquely designed to overcome subsurface issues such as soft bedrock and porous coral rock, which normally could not support a skyscraper without settling.[59] The foundation is similar to that of the Burj Khalifa, but larger; it is expected to average around 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) deep with a concrete pad of area around 7,500\u00a0m2 (81,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). The concrete must have low permeability to keep out corrosive salt water from the Red Sea. Its depth and size are also considered to be an indicator of what the tower's final height will be.[60] The piles will be up to 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft) deep and the pad over 90\u00a0m (300\u00a0ft) across, yet the building, which will weigh over 900,000 tonnes (890,000 long tons; 990,000 short tons), is expected to settle. The idea is that it settles evenly enough so that the building does not tip or put undue stress on the superstructure. Computer modelling programmes performed tests at the site to confirm that the foundation design would work.[61] A later design for the foundation, to be constructed by Bauer in 2013, calls for 270 bored piles up to 110\u00a0m (360\u00a0ft) deep, which have to be installed into the difficult ground conditions.[44] Some materials needed for the structure are 500,000\u00a0m3 (18,000,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of concrete and 80,000\u00a0t (79,000 long tons; 88,000 short tons) of steel.[62]"

It and the surrounding city would have had the ability to accommodate 80,000 residents and one million visitors, according to RIA Novosti.[63] Adrian Smith denied that he was a part of any of the earlier designs, which had been purported in the media.[64] One source even corrected its article and clarified the misunderstanding.[65]"

The supply of water to irrigate the green space would be collected through rainwater.[72][73] On 21 September 2012, it was announced that financing for the Jeddah Tower was complete. Talal Al Maiman, chief executive officer and managing director of Kingdom Real Estate Development Co. said in an interview \"We have all the investors, all the finance, all the money we need,\" Al Maiman said. \"It took us beyond 20 months to convince investors, working every detail and aspect of financing.\"[74] On 10 October 2012, Kingdom Holding awarded contracts totalling $98\u00a0million. Kingdom Holding Co. has signed a deal with Subul Development Company for the sale of land in the Kingdom Riyadh Land project for $66.5\u00a0million. The Kingdom Riyadh Land project, a mixed-use commercial and residential development, will generate more than $5.33\u00a0billion of total investment and will house up to 75,000 people. The final master plan contract was awarded to Omrania & Associates and Barton Willmore.[75] Bauer, a German Foundations equipment manufacturer and contractor was awarded a US$32\u00a0million contract to support the initial phases of construction of the Jeddah Tower. This includes the installation of 270 bored piles with diameters of 1.5 metres and 1.8 metres. The enabling works are expected to begin before the end of 2012 and take about 10 months to complete.[76] On 21 February 2013, the Jeddah Economic Company (JEC) announced that it had appointed an EC Harris/Mace joint venture team to project manage the iconic Jeddah Tower project. The team will be providing project, commercial and design management for the Jeddah Tower development.[77] CEO of JEC, Waleed Abduljaleel Batterjee said that the reason Mace was hired is to use the same team that worked for The Shard in London. On the other hand, EC Harris also has a long list of projects in the region including the Grand Millenium Al-Wahda Hotel, Abu Dhabi's largest hotel complex.[78] On 29 April 2013, news was reported that the Saudi Water Company had signed a 2.2\u00a0billion-riyal ($587\u00a0million) supply deal with Jeddah Economic Co. for the Jeddah tower project. The 25-year agreement to supply 156,000 cubic metres of treated and drinking water a day, enough for 62 Olympic-size pools, was signed by the chief executive of the Jeddah-based developer, Waleed Batraji, and Loay al-Musallam, head of National Water Company.[79]"

Construction of the tower continued,[83] although some senior managers at Kingdom Holding were redirected to other projects.[84] In February 2018, Mounib Hammoud, CEO of Jeddah Economic City, said that construction is continuing and that they hoped to open the tower by 2020.[85] In October 2017 the central core of the tower was at 60 floors and the walls were 248\u00a0m (814\u00a0ft) high,[86] as of end of 2017 a reported height was 252\u00a0m (827\u00a0ft).[87] In March 2018, Kingdom Holding Company signed a deal with Orange Business Services to provide information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure to Jeddah Tower.[85] On 12 March construction of the tower moved forward after the delay.[88]"

        "header": "Challenges",
        "content": "Sustainability of such a tall building would include problems such as vertical transportation limitations, with elevators only being able to go so far; building swaying, caused by wind; and super column settling, which occurs because concrete tends to shrink as it hydrates and settles under load, whereas steel is dimensionally stable, thereby causing the floors to become uneven.[92] Additionally, a very big core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the large number of elevators needed. The core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors.[93] One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts to overcome these problems is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over \"stepped\" designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also use copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive swaying that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days,[94] including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and shear walls, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure in the event of a terrorist attack.[52] Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as Shanghai Tower and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.[95] Like Burj Khalifa, Jeddah employs a similar Y-shaped, triangular footprint which promotes stability[52] and increases window views,[96] as well as a tapering form,[97] with the sheer height and wind being the biggest structural design challenge.[37] The smooth, sloped fa\u00e7ade of Jeddah Tower particularly induces a beneficial phenomenon known as \"wind vortex shedding.\"[98] Normally when wind swirls around the leeward side of a building, rushing in from both sides to fill the low pressure zone, it would create tornado like vortices, which would rock the building from side to side due to variations in pressure, direction and velocity. The dynamic fa\u00e7ade of Jeddah Tower, however, creates an infinite timing differential (whereas Burj Khalifa is limited by the number of steps) in air pressure exertion in any one particular direction, thus creating a more stable structure, as there is no broad area of outstanding pressure or depression at any given time.[52] Put simply, a smooth taper is more aerodynamic than an irregular or jagged taper, while both are advantageous over rectangular geometries. At Jeddah Tower's height, it is considered essentially unfeasible to use a traditional square design.[94]"

        "content": "The triangular footprint and sloped exterior of Jeddah Tower is designed to reduce wind loads; its high surface area also makes it ideal for residential use.[58] The overall design of the tower, which will be located near both the Red Sea and the mouth of the Obhur Creek (Sharm Ob'hur) where it widens as it meets the Red Sea,[51] as well as having frontage on a man-made waterway and harbour that will be built around it,[99] is intended to look like a desert plant shooting upwards as a symbol of Saudi Arabia's growth and future, as well as to add prominence to Jeddah's status as the gateway into the holy city of Mecca.[100] The designer's vision was \"one that represents the new spirit in Saudi Arabia\" (Smith).[101] No official floor count has been given; however, Smith stated in a television interview that it will be about 50 floors more than the Burj Khalifa, which has 163\u00a0occupied floors,[102] leading to the inference that Jeddah Tower will have over 200\u00a0floors.[E][52] The tower will also feature a large, roughly 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) diameter outdoor balcony, known as the sky terrace, on one side of the building for private use by the penthouse floor at level 157;[103][104] it is not the observation deck.[105] It was originally intended to be a helipad, but it was revealed to be an unsuitable landing environment by helicopter pilots.[52] The lower air density, exacerbated by the thin desert atmosphere, will cause the outdoor air temperature towards the top of the tower to be lower than the ground level air, which will provide natural cooling. There is also significantly more air flow (wind) at heights, which is very strong at one kilometre and had a large impact on the structural design of the tower.[52] The Burj Khalifa actually takes in the cooler, cleaner air from the top floors and uses it to air condition the building.[106] Jeddah Tower will be oriented such that no fa\u00e7ade directly faces the sun; it will also use the condensate water from the air conditioning system for irrigation and other purposes throughout the building.[107]"

Much was learned from Burj Khalifa that helped with the design of Jeddah Tower[97] not only structurally, but in methods for designing practical mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems, as well as adhering to local regulations and international building codes.[108] Despite all the physical challenges, Adrian Smith states that practicality is still the greater challenge over structural durability, even in such super-tall designs, and that as with all buildings, Jeddah Tower's form was primarily derived respective of what the building's uses would be, then in accordance with the structural factors that would have to be considered to deliver it.[52] Orange S.A. are designing the information and communications infrastructure of the building.[109]"

Over that, it may be possible if there are improvements in concrete quality. But 2\u00a0km is too big a figure; it's just a step too far at the moment.\"[94]"

Examples include the Singer Building and Metropolitan Life Insurance Building after the Panic of 1907, 40 Wall Street, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building built during the Great Depression, the World Trade Center and Sears Tower built during the 1970s economic downturn, the Petronas Towers built during the Asian Crisis of the late 1990s and the Burj Khalifa built during the Great Recession.[131] Much of the study on this phenomenon was done in 1999 by Andrew Lawrence, a research director at Deutsche Bank who created the \"skyscraper index,\" originally as a joke; however, it illustrated the observation that many of the world's tallest buildings have been built on the eve of financial collapse.[132]"

It was an extremely active season spawning 32 tropical storms, 20 typhoons and five super typhoons. It has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1989, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November.[1] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The first storm, Winona, formed on January 15, while the final storm, Jack, dissipated on December 27. This season was also quite a deadly season that were caused by a few notable storms such as Tropical Storm Cecil, which was the worst storm to impact Vietnam in over 50 years,[2] and Typhoon Gay, which directly impacted the Malay Peninsula as the worst typhoon in 35 years. Both of these storms make up around half of the total fatalities of the entire season alone. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and between 100\u00b0E and 180th meridian. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions in this basin have the \"W\" suffix added to their number. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA."

        "content": "Throughout 1989, several large-scale factors across the western Pacific Ocean displaced unusual characteristics that presented unique difficulties to forecasters. In their annual tropical cyclone report for 1989, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center regarded the season as one of the most challenging and unique years in their history. During much of the year, a very broad monsoon trough was present and resulted in significant diurnal fluctuations in convective activity that inhibited rapid development of many disturbances. The mid-tropospheric ridge was unusually narrow and led to difficulties in forecasting straight-running storms. Additionally, the tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) had a major role in the development of many systems, most notably Typhoon Gordon which formed from a single thunderstorm underneath a TUTT cell.[3] The season began with the unusual development of Tropical Storm Winona east of the International Date Line in early January. Remaining active for two weeks, the system crossed the basin before dissipating over the Philippines. Following a three-month lull in activity, a powerful typhoon developed in mid-April and was the second system in nine years to become a super typhoon during that month. By mid-May, an extensive monsoon trough had become established from the Bay of Bengal eastward into the South China Sea. Typhoon Brenda developed from this trough over the South China Sea and moved inland over southern China before dissipating. The typhoon left an area of enhanced low-level southerly flow in its wake that triggered the development of Typhoon Cecil at the end of the month. Two more storms developed during June \u2013 Typhoon Dot and Tropical Storm Ellis. The first was a strong typhoon that developed near the Caroline Islands and moved westward, eventually dissipating over Vietnam. The second was a poorly organized system that moved generally northward and struck Japan.[3] In early July, a surge in the monsoon trough over the basin resulted in the development of Tropical Storm Faye. While this system was over the Philippines, Typhoon Gordon developed underneath a TUTT cell to the east. Following Gordon's rapid intensification phase, a new tropical storm developed within an area of enhanced divergence associated with the same TUTT cell. Several days later, the monsoon trough became exceptionally active and spawned several consecutive cyclones in late-July: Irving over the South China Sea, Judy near the Mariana Islands, 12W near Taiwan, and Ken\u2013Lola around the Ryukyu Islands. The development of seven tropical cyclones in July made it the most active July since 1973. The extreme activity continued into August with the formations of Mac, Nancy, Owen, Peggy, and 19W, all of which formed within the monsoon trough. The rapid succession of Nancy, Owen, and Peggy led to several days of binary interaction between the systems well to the south of Japan. Tropical Storm Roger developed near the Ryukyu Islands a few days after 19W dissipated and rapidly tracked northeastward through Japan. This was the only storm of the month not to develop within the monsoon trough. The final system of August, 21W, developed to the northeast of Guam and dissipated due to strong wind shear.[3] Heavy rains alongside several typhoons between June and September resulted in deadly flooding across parts of Anhui, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Sichuan, and Zhejiang provinces in China. The floods killed approximately 3,000\u00a0people and overall losses reached $2.7\u00a0billion.[4]"

Embedded within broad easterly flow, the storm turned west-southwestward, a heading it would retain until dissipation, and accelerated. This acceleration caused slight strengthening of the storm by enhancing winds on the north side of the low.[5] On January\u00a016, Winona passed approximately 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) south of Wake Island. Operationally, it was not until January\u00a018 that the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system.[5] At the same time, the JMA assessed Winona to have been a weak tropical storm with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[6] Around 0700\u00a0UTC on January\u00a018, the ship MV Williams passed close to or through the center of Winona and measured a pressure of 991\u00a0mbar (991\u00a0hPa; 29.3\u00a0inHg) alongside 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) sustained winds with gusts up to 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). This was the only direct measurement in relation to the cyclone. Early on January\u00a019, the JTWC assessed Winona to have reached its peak intensity with 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) winds as it passed just north of Saipan. Later that day, convection quickly diminished as Winona moved into a shallow air mass-produced by polar system to the north. The system maintained only intermittent convection for another day before making landfall in the central Philippines. The storm quickly weakened and dissipated on January\u00a022 as it emerged into the South China Sea.[5] Before dissipating, the remnants of Winona tracked through the Philippines; however, no known impact resulted from its passage. Throughout its nearly two week existence, Winona traveled approximately 10,185\u00a0km (6,329\u00a0mi) across the Pacific Ocean.[5]"

The intense cyclone missed Guam by 130 kilometres (81\u00a0mi) to the southeast, with winds peaking at 68 knots (126\u00a0km/h) on Guam. Thereafter, Andy recurved to the northeast and steadily weakened due to increased vertical wind shear out of the west, dissipating as a tropical cyclone on April 24. Andy became the second typhoon to form in April in nine years.[7] Prior to Typhoon Andy's arrival, 14 B-52s and 3 KC-135s were relocated from Anderson Air Force Base in Guam to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, while one KC-135 was sent to Clark Air Base in the Philippines.[8] Nearly half of the schools in Guam were converted to public shelters.[9] Approximately 1,100 people sought refuge across the island.[9] On April\u00a021, the typhoon's close passage brought sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) and gusts up to 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) to Guam.[8] The storm's high winds downed many power lines, leaving about 15\u00a0percent of Guam without power for several hours. Overall damage from the storm was minimal despite the strong winds and no reports of major structural damage or injuries were received.[9] Heavy rain also impact much of the southern Mariana Islands, amounting to about 130\u00a0mm (5.1\u00a0in) in Guam.

After briefly crossing land, the storm moved into the Gulf of Tonkin and ultimately struck Vietnam on October\u00a03 before dissipating the next day over Laos.[77] Across Hainan Island, Brian caused extensive damage to property and infrastructure. Nearly 185,000\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm's high winds or flash flooding.

After moving inland, the typhoon rapidly weakened to a tropical storm. Once back over water in the South China Sea, wind shear prevented re-intensification. Elsie eventually made landfall in Vietnam on October\u00a022 and dissipated the following day over Laos.[81] In the Philippines, Elsie worsened the situation already left in the wakes of typhoons Angela and Dan. Although it was stronger than the previous two, Elsie caused far less damage due to the relatively sparse population in the area of landfall. During the storm's passage, 47 people were killed and another 363 were injured. Damages throughout the country amounted to $35.4\u00a0million and roughly 332,000 people were left homeless.[27][75]"

With most of the campus flooded, students were forced to head to the upper floors of the school's buildings.[4] Shopping malls along Claro M. Recto Avenue were hit by the floodwaters as well; Limketkai Center was rendered completely impassable.[5] One mall's basement parking area was filled with water, while another mall near Bitan-ag Creek was also flooded, despite the area already being elevated.[6] As a result of the heavy rain in Cagayan de Oro, parts of Camaman-an, Patag, Carmen, and a number of urban barangays were swamped by the deluge.[2] Two landslides were reported in the city; one on Masterson Avenue near Pryce Plaza Hotel, and in Paglaum Village, Camaman-an.[6] The City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Department (CDRRMD) said that a rain gauge near the Cagayan River recorded a total of 166.2\u00a0mm,[2] about 20\u00a0mm less than the amount of rainfall recorded in December 2011 when Tropical Storm Sendong (Washi) impacted the city.[7] However, the two-day rainfall amount was higher than that from both Tropical Depression Agaton (Lingling) and Tropical Storm Seniang (Jangmi).[8] Numerous business establishments and schools opened their doors to people unable to return home because of the floods. This included Centrio Mall, SM City Cagayan de Oro and Limketkai Mall which remained open after hours, and Xavier University, which made its canteen, a number of classrooms and covered courts as a temporary refuge.[9] Floods also affected the provinces of Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Misamis Oriental, Lanao del Sur and Bukidnon.[10] Landslides were also reported in several parts of Visayas and Mindanao.[11]\n[12] Classes were suspended in Tacloban, Leyte, Southern Leyte, and Misamis Oriental,[13] as well as parts of Samar, Northern Samar, Eastern Samar provinces.[14]"

A similar situation occurred in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Sendong when 24 people died because of an outbreak of leptospirosis.[18] According to Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) secretary Mark Villar, the agency will ask the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for an additional P300 million for the accelerated completion of various projects that are meant to reduce future flooding in Cagayan de Oro. Meanwhile, the DPWH was called into question by Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III for a lack of coordination with the City Government of Cagayan de Oro when implementing projects.[19] The agency also admitted that the recently completed bridge over Bitan-ag Creek failed to prevent neck-level floodwaters from inundating Limketkai Center and USTP.

Under the rule of Renzong, an emperor known for his modesty, the Song worked for five years futilely attempting to restore the Yellow River's previous course. This project used over 35,000 employees, 100,000 conscripts, and 220,000 tons of wood and bamboo in a single year\u00a0\u2013 before the project was abandoned in 1041.[1] Only seven years after the project to restore the river's course was ended, the Yellow River flood of 1048 caused the river to move much further north, meaning that the Chihe, You, and Jin rivers were no longer a threat to agriculture around modern-day Hebei and Shandong. Due to the flooding of agriculture in Dezhou and Bozhou, as well as the sediments carried along the Yellow River's three new tributary rivers, the 1034 flood was recorded as reducing the revenues of the northern provinces by half. The economic consequences of the first flood however were not fully repaired by the time that the second flood came, leading to yet more devastation in the northern provinces of the Northern Song.

Around 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a014, the system re-strengthened and again attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h). Despite moving back over open waters, the depression failed to intensify further. Operationally, the system was thought to have made landfall in east-central Florida, but later analysis revealed that the center remained over water. The depression continued northward until striking near Charleston, South Carolina late on June\u00a016, still with the same intensity. It degenerated into a remnant low pressure area about six hours later.[3] Its remnants continued northeastward across the Southeastern United States, the Mid-Atlantic, and New England until dissipating fully on June\u00a018.[1]"

Precipitation peaked at 32 inches (810\u00a0mm) in Friendship, located in Westmoreland Parish.[8] As the flooding began, several shelters were open in the parish.[9] Residents in the Savanna-la-Mar area were forced to evacuate by boats or makeshift rafts.[10] The flooding also ruined crops. Sugar cane, which was already 70\u201380\u00a0percent harvested, suffered about $2.25\u00a0million (1979 USD) in damage. It was estimated that 4\u00a0million lb (1.8\u00a0million kg) of bananas were lost, worth nearly $1 million. In total, agricultural interests incurred $5.89\u00a0million in damage, chiefly f which was in Westmoreland Parish. The storm affected an estimated 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) of roadways impacted, with about 2,000\u00a0ft (610\u00a0m) of highway completely washed out. Three bridges collapsed, while 10\u00a0others sustained damage.[11] The increasing height and volume of the Bluefields River led to debris flow and created a colluvium \u2013 an unconsolidated deposit of sediments \u2013 near the mouth of the river. In the valley areas, temporary lakes were formed and small dams were overtopped.[12] The cities of Chigwell, Enfield, Exeter, Leamington, and New Market were all submerged during the flooding. New Market was inundated with as much as 80\u00a0ft (24\u00a0m) of water during the disaster,[13] which did not completely recede until more than six months later.[10] This resulted in extreme damage to or complete loss of crops, livestock, and household possessions.[10] Extensive impact to property was reported, including to electricity, telephones, buildings, and railways, with a \"conservative\" estimate of $39.3\u00a0million in damage. At least 1,000\u00a0homes were severely damaged or destroyed.[11] As many as 40,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[9] Overall, there were 40\u00a0deaths and approximately $27\u00a0million in damage.[14] Following the storm, Hanover, Saint Elizabeth, Saint James, and Westmoreland parishes were considered disaster areas.[11] A task force was established by the Prime Minister Michael Manley for reconstruction efforts.[13] About 7,758\u00a0families, a total of 36,391\u00a0people, required assistance with food supplies for over 13\u00a0weeks. The Housing Task Force called for the construction of 582\u00a0new houses, 300\u00a0of which for those left homeless. The houses constructed for the people rendered homeless were prefabricated by the Ministry of Housing and then erected by the local authorities, under the guidance of the Ministry of Local Government.[15] In response to the disaster, the Government of Jamaica established the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management in July\u00a01980.[16] The depression and its remnants also brought rainfall and high tides to the eastern United States. In South Carolina, precipitation peaked at 6.89\u00a0in (175\u00a0mm) in Cheraw.[1] Along the coast, waves reached 13\u00a0ft (4.0\u00a0m) in height, strong enough to tear a boat from its mooring at Surfside Beach. One person was listed as missing and later presumed to have died.[17]"

Southeasterly flow from a low level jet fueled the system with ample moisture, leading to widespread rainfall rates of 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) per hour.[10] Rainfall intensified throughout the night into the morning of April\u00a018 with rainfall rates reaching 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) per hour, leading to a life-threatening situation.[11] At 4:39\u00a0a.m. CDT, a flash flood emergency was declared for parts of Colorado, Waller, Grimes, Montgomery, Harris, and Austin counties,[12] later expanding to Fort Bend.[13] Accumulations peaked at 17.6\u00a0in (450\u00a0mm) along Little Mound Creek at Mathis Road to the northwest of Houston. Other significant totals include 16.48\u00a0in (419\u00a0mm) along Cypress Creek at Sharp Road, 16.32\u00a0in (415\u00a0mm) along Langham Creek at Longenbaugh, and 16.22\u00a0in (412\u00a0mm) in Monaville.

This marked the wettest April on record for Houston.[15] At the same time, the upper low produced a major snowstorm in the Rocky Mountains and High Plains from April 16\u201317.[2] Due to the omega block, snowfall remained concentrated around the Denver metropolitan areas. Because of this, some snowfall totals ranged up to 3\u20134 feet (36\u201348\u00a0in) in some areas. This definitely led to areas coming close to breaking their top-snowiest days in April.  A climate study analyzing the 2015 flood in Texas and Oklahoma[16] has found an intensified El Ni\u00f1o effect on the climatologically wet season of spring, and the intensification has a trace of anthropogenic climate warming. The upper low began to move eastward on April 19, as the omega block began to break down. It was expected to reach the East Coast by April 22, with much less rainfall totals as it began to accelerate."

        "content": " The Great Depression was a severe global economic downturn from 1929 to 1939 that affected many countries across the world. It became evident after a sharp decline in stock prices in the United States, the largest economy in the world at the time, leading to a period of economic depression.[1] The economic contagion began around September 1929 and led to the Wall Street stock market crash of October (Black Tuesday). This crisis marked the start of a prolonged period of economic hardship characterized by high unemployment rates and widespread business failures.[2] Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession.[3] Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries,[specify] the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II. Devastating effects were seen in both rich and poor countries with falling personal income, prices, tax revenues, and profits. International trade fell by more than 50%, unemployment in the U.S. rose to 23% and in some countries rose as high as 33%.[4] Cities around the world were severely affected, especially those dependent on heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60%.[5][6][7] Faced with plummeting demand and few job alternatives, areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most.[8] Economic historians usually consider the catalyst of the Great Depression to be the devastating Wall Street Crash. However, some dispute this, seeing the crash less as a cause of the Depression and more a symptom of the rising nervousness of investors partly due to gradual price declines caused by falling sales of consumer goods (as a result of overproduction because of new production techniques, falling exports and income inequality, among other factors) that had already been underway as part of a gradual depression.[4][9]"

        "content": "After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped from 381 to 198 over the course of two months, optimism persisted for some time. The stock market rose in early 1930, with the Dow returning to 294 (pre-depression levels) in April 1930, before steadily declining for years, to a low of 41 in 1932.[10] At the beginning, governments and businesses spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, consumers, many of whom suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year, cut  expenditures by 10%. In addition, beginning in the mid-1930s, a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the U.S.[11] Interest rates dropped to low levels by mid-1930, but expected deflation and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant that consumer spending and investment remained low.[12] By May 1930, automobile sales declined to below the levels of 1928. Prices, in general, began to decline, although wages held steady in 1930. Then a deflationary spiral started in 1931. Farmers faced a worse outlook; declining crop prices and a Great Plains drought crippled their economic outlook. At its peak, the Great Depression saw nearly 10% of all Great Plains farms change hands despite federal assistance.[13] The decline in the U.S. economy was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first; then, internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better.[citation needed] Frantic attempts by individual countries to shore up their economies through protectionist policies \u2013 such as the 1930 U.S. Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act and retaliatory tariffs in other countries \u2013 exacerbated the collapse in global trade, contributing to the depression.[14] By 1933, the economic decline pushed world trade to one third of its level compared to four years earlier.[15]"

In the aftermath of World War I, the Roaring Twenties had brought considerable wealth to the United States and Western Europe.[17] The year 1929 dawned with considerable economic progress in the American economy. A small stock crash occurred on 25 March 1929, but the crash was stabilized. Despite signs of economic trouble, the market continued to improve through September. Stock prices began to slump in September, and were volatile at the end of September.[18] A large sell-off of stocks began in mid-October. Finally, on 24 October, Black Thursday, the American stock market crashed 11% at the opening bell. Actions to stabilize the market failed, and on 28 October, Black Monday, the market crashed another 12%. The panic peaked the next day on Black Tuesday, when the market saw another 11% drop.[19][20]\nThousands of investors were ruined, and billions of dollars had been lost; many stocks could not be sold at any price.[20] The market recovered 12% on Wednesday, but the damage had been done. Though the market recovered from 14 November until 17 April 1930, it entered a prolonged slump. From 17 April 1930 until 8 July 1932, the market continued to lose 89% of its value.[21] Despite the crash, the worst of the crisis did not reverberate around the world until after 1929. The crisis hit panic levels again in December 1930, with a bank run on the Bank of United States (privately run, no relation to the government). Unable to pay out to all of its creditors, the bank failed.[22][23]\nAmong the 608 American banks that closed in November and December 1930, the Bank of United States accounted for a third of the total $550 million deposits lost and, with its closure, bank failures reached a critical mass.[24]"

        "content": "The Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act was passed in the United States on 17 June 1930, having been proposed the year prior. Ostensibly aimed at protecting the American economy as the Depression began to take root, it backfired enormously and may have even caused the Depression. The consensus view among economists and economic historians (including Keynesians, Monetarists and Austrian economists) is that the passage of the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff exacerbated the Great Depression,[25] although there is disagreement as to how much. In the popular view, the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff was a leading cause of the depression.[26][27] In a 1995 survey of American economic historians, two-thirds agreed that the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act at least worsened the Great Depression.[28] According to the U.S. Senate website, the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act is among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history.[29] Many economists have argued that the sharp decline in international trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression, especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade.  Most historians and economists blame the Act for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries. While foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the U.S. and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming, it was a much larger factor in many other countries.[30] The average ad valorem (value based) rate of duties on dutiable imports for 1921\u20131925 was 25.9% but under the new tariff it jumped to 50% during 1931\u20131935. In dollar terms, American exports declined over the next four years from about $5.2\u00a0billion in 1929 to $1.7\u00a0billion in 1933; so, not only did the physical volume of exports fall, but also the prices fell by about 1\u20443 as written. Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, and lumber.[citation needed] Governments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as: \"imposing tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls\". These restrictions triggered much tension among countries that had large amounts of bilateral trade, causing major export-import reductions during the depression. Not all governments enforced the same measures of protectionism. Some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, while other countries reduced \"trade and exchange restrictions only marginally\":[31]"

Even countries that did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction first-hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with lower interest rates. Under the gold standard's price\u2013specie flow mechanism, countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline (deflation).[32][33] There is also consensus that protectionist policies, and primarily the passage of the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act, helped to exacerbate, or even cause the Great Depression.[28]"

        "content": "Some economic studies have indicated that the rigidities of the gold standard not only spread the downturn worldwide, but also suspended gold convertibility (devaluing the currency in gold terms) that did the most to make recovery possible.[35] Every major currency left the gold standard during the Great Depression. The UK was the first to do so. Facing speculative attacks on the pound and depleting gold reserves, in September 1931 the Bank of England ceased exchanging pound notes for gold and the pound was floated on foreign exchange markets. Japan and the Scandinavian countries followed in 1931. Other countries, such as Italy and the United States, remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933, while a few countries in the so-called \"gold bloc\", led by France and including Poland, Belgium and Switzerland, stayed on the standard until 1935\u201336. According to later analysis, the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery. For example, The UK and Scandinavia, which left the gold standard in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer. Countries such as China, which had a silver standard, almost avoided the depression entirely. The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that country's severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries, including developing countries. This partly explains why the experience and length of the depression differed between regions and states around the world.[36]"

With the rise in violence of National Socialist ('Nazi') and Communist movements, as well as investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies,[39] investors withdrew their short-term money from Germany as confidence spiraled downward. The Reichsbank lost 150\u00a0million marks in the first week of June, 540\u00a0million in the second, and 150\u00a0million in two days, 19\u201320 June. Collapse was at hand. U.S. President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on payment of war reparations. This angered Paris, which depended on a steady flow of German payments, but it slowed the crisis down, and the moratorium was agreed to in July 1931. An International conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on 19 August a standstill agreement froze Germany's foreign liabilities for six months. Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures were more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary. The crisis continued to get worse in Germany, bringing political upheaval that finally led to the coming to power of Hitler's Nazi regime in January 1933.[40] The world financial crisis now began to overwhelm Britain; investors around the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of \u00a32.5\u00a0million per day.[41] Credits of \u00a325\u00a0million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of \u00a315\u00a0million fiduciary note slowed, but did not reverse, the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending, and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits 20%. The attack on welfare was unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but King George V insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition \"National Government\". The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election, the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as prime minister for a largely Conservative coalition.[42][43]"

        "content": "In most countries of the world, recovery from the Great Depression began in 1933.[9] In the U.S., recovery began in early 1933,[9] but the U.S. did not return to 1929 GNP for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about 15% in 1940, albeit down from the high of 25% in 1933. There is no consensus among economists regarding the motive force for the U.S. economic expansion that continued through most of the Roosevelt years (and the 1937 recession that interrupted it). The common view among most economists is that Roosevelt's New Deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery, although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession. Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt's words and actions portended.[45][46] It was the rollback of those same reflationary policies that led to the interruption of a recession beginning in late 1937.[47][48] One contributing policy that reversed reflation was the Banking Act of 1935, which effectively raised reserve requirements, causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery.[49] GDP returned to its upward trend in 1938.[44] A revisionist view among some economists holds that the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression, as they argue that National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and National Labor Relations Act of 1935 restricted competition and established price fixing.[50] John Maynard Keynes did not think that the New Deal under Roosevelt single-handedly ended the Great Depression: \"It is, it seems, politically impossible for a capitalistic democracy to organize expenditure on the scale necessary to make the grand experiments which would prove my case\u2014except in war conditions.\"[51] According to Christina Romer, the money supply growth caused by huge international gold inflows was a crucial source of the recovery of the United States economy, and that the economy showed little sign of self-correction. The gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the U.S. dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe.[52] In their book, A Monetary History of the United States, Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors, and contended that it was much slowed by poor management of money by the Federal Reserve System. Chairman of the Federal Reserve (2006\u20132014) Ben Bernanke agreed that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery.[53] Bernanke also saw a strong role for institutional factors, particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system,[54] and pointed out that the Depression should be examined in an international perspective.[55]"

Birthrates fell everywhere, as children were postponed until families could financially support them. The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12% from 19.3 births per thousand population in 1930, to 17.0 in 1935.[56] In Canada, half of Roman Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births.[57] Among the few women in the labor force, layoffs were less common in the white-collar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed.[58][59][60] Across Britain, there was a tendency for married women to join the labor force, competing for part-time jobs especially.[61][62] In France, very slow population growth, especially in comparison to Germany continued to be a serious issue in the 1930s. Support for increasing welfare programs during the depression included a focus on women in the family. The Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de la Natalit\u00e9 campaigned for provisions enacted in the Code de la Famille (1939) that increased state assistance to families with children and required employers to protect the jobs of fathers, even if they were immigrants.[63] In rural and small-town areas, women expanded their operation of vegetable gardens to include as much food production as possible. In the United States, agricultural organizations sponsored programs to teach housewives how to optimize their gardens and to raise poultry for meat and eggs.[64] Rural women made feed sack dresses and other items for themselves and their families and homes from feed sacks.[65] In American cities, African American women quiltmakers enlarged their activities, promoted collaboration, and trained neophytes. Quilts were created for practical use from various inexpensive materials and increased social interaction for women and promoted camaraderie and personal fulfillment.[66] Oral history provides evidence for how housewives in a modern industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat\u2014sometimes even horse meat\u2014and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid\u2014extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans\u2014to help cousins and in-laws.[67] In Japan, official government policy was deflationary and the opposite of Keynesian spending. Consequently, the government launched a campaign across the country to induce households to reduce their consumption, focusing attention on spending by housewives.[68] In Germany, the government tried to reshape private household consumption under the Four-Year Plan of 1936 to achieve German economic self-sufficiency. The Nazi women's organizations, other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic self-sufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war. The organizations, propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living. However, these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives.[69]"

Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression, though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery, though it did help in reducing unemployment.[9][70][71][72] The rearmament policies leading up to World War II helped stimulate the economies of Europe in 1937\u20131939. By 1937, unemployment in Britain had fallen to 1.5\u00a0million. The mobilization of manpower following the outbreak of war in 1939 ended unemployment.[73] The American mobilization for World War II at the end of 1941 moved approximately ten million people out of the civilian labor force and into the war.[74]\nThis finally eliminated the last effects from the Great Depression and brought the U.S. unemployment rate down below 10%.[75] World War II had a dramatic effect on many parts of the  American economy.[76] Government-financed capital spending accounted for only 5% of the annual U.S. investment in industrial capital in 1940; by 1943, the government accounted for 67% of U.S. capital investment.[76] The massive war spending doubled economic growth rates, either masking the effects of the Depression or essentially ending the Depression. Businessmen ignored the mounting national debt and heavy new taxes, redoubling their efforts for greater output to take advantage of generous government contracts.[77]"

The consensus among demand-driven theories is that a large-scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending. Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand.[80] Monetarists believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but the shrinking of the money supply greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression.[81] Economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression.[82] Today there is also significant academic support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that \u2013 building on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz \u2013 add non-monetary explanations.[83][84] There is a consensus that the Federal Reserve System should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse, by expanding the money supply and acting as lender of last resort.

        "header": "Monetarist view",
        "content": "The monetarist explanation was given by American economists Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz.[86] They argued that the Great Depression was caused by the banking crisis that caused one-third of all banks to vanish, a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly monetary contraction of 35%, which they called \"The Great Contraction\". This caused a price drop of 33% (deflation).[87] By not lowering interest rates, by not increasing the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling, the Federal Reserve passively watched the transformation of a normal recession into the Great Depression. Friedman and Schwartz argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would merely have been an ordinary recession if the Federal Reserve had taken aggressive action.[88][89] This view was endorsed in 2002 by Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke in a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz with this statement: Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again. The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures \u2013 particularly that of the New York Bank of United States \u2013 which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that, if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks, or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell, all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did, and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did.[92] With significantly less money to go around, businesses could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed, forcing many to stop investing. This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction, especially the New York branch.[93] One reason why the Federal Reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was the gold standard. At that time, the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the Federal Reserve Act, which required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession. This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes.[94] A \"promise of gold\" is not as good as \"gold in the hand\", particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40% of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding. During the bank panics, a portion of those demand notes was redeemed for Federal Reserve gold. Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit, any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit. On 5 April 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 making the private ownership of gold certificates, coins and bullion illegal, reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold.[94]"

In such a situation, the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment. Keynes's basic idea was simple: to keep people fully employed, governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending or cutting taxes. As the Depression wore on, Franklin D. Roosevelt tried public works, farm subsidies, and other devices to restart the U.S. economy, but never completely gave up trying to balance the budget. According to the Keynesians, this improved the economy, but Roosevelt never spent enough to bring the economy out of recession until the start of World War II.[95]"

        "header": "Debt deflation",
        "content": "Irving Fisher argued that the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was a vicious circle of deflation and growing over-indebtedness.[96] He outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust. The chain of events proceeded as follows: During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%.[97] Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, which could not be paid back.[98] Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets.[98] Outstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20\u201350% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929 and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s.) By April 1933, around $7\u00a0billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday.[99] Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans that borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending.[98] Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated. The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices that it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed.[96] This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression. Fisher's debt-deflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counter-argument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Pure re-distributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects. Building on both the monetary hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz and the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens, which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently lowers aggregate demand; a further price level decline would then result in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe, falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, which in turn leads to a credit crunch that seriously harms the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption, which results in declining aggregate demand and additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.[100][101][102]"

        "header": "Expectations hypothesis",
        "content": "Since economic mainstream turned to the new neoclassical synthesis, expectations are a central element of macroeconomic models. According to Peter Temin, Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and Christina Romer, the key to recovery and to ending the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive in March 1933 when Franklin D. Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, and investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short-term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933, people expected further deflation and a recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes, people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With these positive expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investment. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crisis and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70\u201380% of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933, and output would have been 30% lower in 1937 than in 1933.[103][104][105] The recession of 1937\u20131938, which slowed down economic recovery from the Great Depression, is explained by fears of the population that the moderate tightening of the monetary and fiscal policy in 1937 were first steps to a restoration of the pre-1933 policy regime.[106]"

When threatened by expectations of a depression, central banks should expand liquidity in the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to prevent a collapse in money supply and aggregate demand.[107] At the beginning of the Great Depression, most economists believed in Say's law and the equilibrating powers of the market, and failed to understand the severity of the Depression. Outright leave-it-alone liquidationism was a common position, and was universally held by Austrian School economists.[108] The liquidationist position held that a depression worked to liquidate failed businesses and investments that had been made obsolete by technological development \u2013 releasing factors of production (capital and labor) to be redeployed in other more productive sectors of the dynamic economy. They argued that even if self-adjustment of the economy caused mass bankruptcies, it was still the best course.[108] Economists like Barry Eichengreen and J. Bradford DeLong note that President Herbert Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932, when he lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon and replaced him.[108][109][110] An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of many Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist position led to disastrous consequences.[109] Unlike what liquidationists expected, a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed but vanished during the first years of the Great Depression. According to a study by Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers, the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre-1924 levels by 1933.[111] Milton Friedman called leave-it-alone liquidationism \"dangerous nonsense\".[107] He wrote: I think the Austrian business-cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm. If you go back to the 1930s, which is a key point, here you had the Austrians sitting in London, Hayek and Lionel Robbins, and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world. You've just got to let it cure itself. You can't do anything about it. You will only make it worse. ... I think by encouraging that kind of do-nothing policy both in Britain and in the United States, they did harm.[109]"

In their view, much like the monetarists, the Federal Reserve (created in 1913) shoulders much of the blame; however, unlike the Monetarists, they argue that the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the money supply in the 1920s which led to an unsustainable credit-driven boom.[112] In the Austrian view, it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and capital goods. Therefore, by the time the Federal Reserve tightened in 1928 it was far too late to prevent an economic contraction.[112] In February 1929 Hayek published a paper predicting the Federal Reserve's actions would lead to a crisis starting in the stock and credit markets.[113] According to Rothbard, the government support for failed enterprises and efforts to keep wages above their market values actually prolonged the Depression.[114] Unlike Rothbard, after 1970 Hayek believed that the Federal Reserve had further contributed to the problems of the Depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the Depression.[115] However, during the Depression (in 1932[116] and in 1934)[116] Hayek had criticized both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England for not taking a more contractionary stance.[116] Hans Sennholz argued that most boom and busts that plagued the American economy, such as those in 1819\u201320, 1839\u20131843, 1857\u20131860, 1873\u20131878, 1893\u20131897, and 1920\u201321, were generated by government creating a boom through easy money and credit, which was soon followed by the inevitable bust.[117] Ludwig von Mises wrote in the 1930s: \"Credit expansion cannot increase the supply of real goods. It merely brings about a rearrangement. It diverts capital investment away from the course prescribed by the state of economic wealth and market conditions. It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods. As a result, the upswing lacks a solid base. It is not real prosperity. It is illusory prosperity. It did not develop from an increase in economic wealth, i.e. the accumulation of savings made available for productive investment. Rather, it arose because the credit expansion created the illusion of such an increase. Sooner or later, it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand.\"[118][119]"

Thus the unequal distribution of wealth throughout the 1920s caused the Great Depression.[122][123] According to this view, the root cause of the Great Depression was a global over-investment in heavy industry capacity compared to wages and earnings from independent businesses, such as farms. The proposed solution was for the government to pump money into the consumers' pockets. That is, it must redistribute purchasing power, maintaining the industrial base, and re-inflating prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into consumer spending. The economy was overbuilt, and new factories were not needed. Foster and Catchings recommended[124] federal and state governments to start large construction projects, a program followed by Hoover and Roosevelt."

After six years of government austerity measures, which succeeded in reestablishing Chile's creditworthiness, Chileans elected to office during the 1938\u201358 period a succession of center and left-of-center governments interested in promoting economic growth through government intervention.

During the depression, it suffered severely from low prices and marketing problems that affected all colonial commodities in Africa. Sisal producers established centralized controls for the export of their fibre.[138] There was widespread unemployment and hardship among peasants, labourers, colonial auxiliaries, and artisans.[139]  The budgets of colonial governments were cut, which forced the reduction in ongoing infrastructure projects, such as the building and upgrading of roads, ports and communications.[140] The budget cuts delayed the schedule for creating systems of higher education.[141] The depression severely hurt the export-based Belgian Congo economy because of the drop in international demand for raw materials and for agricultural products. For example, the price of peanuts fell from 125 to 25 centimes. In some areas, as in the Katanga mining region, employment declined by 70%.

The financial crisis escalated out of control in mid-1931, starting with the collapse of the Credit Anstalt in Vienna in May.[38] This put heavy pressure on Germany, which was already in political turmoil with the rise in violence of national socialist and communist movements, as well as with investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies,[39] investors withdrew their short-term money from Germany as confidence spiraled downward. The Reichsbank lost 150\u00a0million marks in the first week of June, 540\u00a0million in the second, and 150\u00a0million in two days, 19\u201320 June. Collapse was at hand. U.S. President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on payment of war reparations. This angered Paris, which depended on a steady flow of German payments, but it slowed the crisis down, and the moratorium was agreed to in July 1931. An international conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on 19 August a standstill agreement froze Germany's foreign liabilities for six months. Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures became more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary.[40] In 1932, 90% of German reparation payments were cancelled (in the 1950s, Germany repaid all its missed reparations debts). Widespread unemployment reached 25% as every sector was hurt. The government did not increase government spending to deal with Germany's growing crisis, as they were afraid that a high-spending policy could lead to a return of the hyperinflation that had affected Germany in 1923. Germany's Weimar Republic was hit hard by the depression, as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped.[148] The unemployment rate reached nearly 30% in 1932.[149] The German political landscape was dramatically altered, leading to Adolf Hitler's rise to power. The Nazi Party rose from being peripheral to winning 18.3% of the vote in the September 1930 election and the Communist Party also made gains, while moderate forces like the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party and the People's Party lost seats. The next two years were marked by increased street violence between Nazis and Communists, while governments under President Paul von Hindenburg increasingly relied on rule by decree, bypassing the Reichstag.[150] Hitler ran for the Presidency in 1932, and while he lost to the incumbent Hindenburg in the election, it marked a point during which both Nazi Party and the Communist parties rose in the years following the crash to altogether possess a Reichstag majority following the general election in July 1932.[149][151] Although the Nazis lost seats in November 1932 election, they remained the largest party, and Hitler was appointed as Chancellor the following January. The government formation deal was designed to give Hitler's conservative coalition partners many checks on his power, but over the next few months, the Nazis manoeuvred to consolidate a single-party dictatorship.[152] Hitler followed an autarky economic policy, creating a network of client states and economic allies in central Europe and Latin America. By cutting wages and taking control of labor unions, plus public works spending, unemployment fell significantly by 1935. Large-scale military spending played a major role in the recovery.[153] The policies had the effect of driving up the cost of food imports and depleting foreign currency reserves, leading to economic impasse by 1936. Nazi Germany faced a choice of either reversing course or pressing ahead with rearmament and autarky. Hitler chose the latter route, which according to Ian Kershaw \"could only be partially accomplished without territorial expansion\" and therefore war.[154][155]"

The Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period, the drachma was pegged to the U.S. dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April 1931. This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France, and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which several European countries did during the period. Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma, stifling imports, allowed the Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression. In 1939, the Greek industrial output was 179% that of 1928. These industries were for the most part \"built on sand\" as one report of the Bank of Greece put it, as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive. Despite the global depression, Greece managed to suffer comparatively little, averaging an average growth rate of 3.5% from 1932 to 1939. The dictatorial regime of Ioannis Metaxas took over the Greek government in 1936, and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War."

Japan's Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was the first to implement what have come to be identified as Keynesian economic policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending; and second, by devaluing the currency. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures. Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective.[167] The devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect. Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets. The deficit spending proved to be most profound and went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces. By 1933, Japan was already out of the depression. By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions. This resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, especially those in the army, culminating in his assassination in the course of the February 26 Incident. This had a chilling effect on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government. From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow. Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which remained a problem until the end of World War\u00a0II. The deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan. Japan's industrial production doubled during the 1930s. Further, in 1929 the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries, especially textile companies (many of Japan's automakers, such as Toyota, have their roots in the textile industry). By 1940 light industry had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy.[168]"

As a result, Latin Americans export industries felt the depression quickly. World prices for commodities such as wheat, coffee and copper plunged. Exports from all of Latin America to the U.S. fell in value from $1.2\u00a0billion in 1929 to $335\u00a0million in 1933, rising to $660\u00a0million in 1940. But on the other hand, the depression led the area governments to develop new local industries and expand consumption and production. Following the example of the New Deal, governments in the area approved regulations and created or improved welfare institutions that helped millions of new industrial workers to achieve a better standard of living."

At that time, Poland was under the authoritarian rule of Sanacja, whose leader, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, was opposed to leaving the gold standard until his death in 1935. As a result, Poland was unable to perform a more active monetary and budget policy. Additionally, Poland was a relatively young country that emerged merely 10 years earlier after being partitioned between German, Russian and the Austro-Hungarian Empires for over a century. Prior to independence, the Russian part exported 91% of its exports to Russia proper, while the German part exported 68% to Germany proper. After independence, these markets were largely lost, as Russia transformed into USSR that was mostly a closed economy, and Germany was in a tariff war with Poland throughout the 1920s.[173] Industrial production fell significantly: in 1932 hard coal production was down 27% compared to 1928, steel production was down 61%, and iron ore production noted an 89% decrease.[174] On the other hand, electrotechnical, leather, and paper industries noted marginal increases in production output. Overall, industrial production decreased by 41%.[175] A distinct feature of the Great Depression in Poland was the de-concentration of industry, as larger conglomerates were less flexible and paid their workers more than smaller ones. Unemployment rate rose significantly (up to 43%) while nominal wages fell by 51% in 1933 and 56% in 1934, relative to 1928. However, real wages fell less due to the government's policy of decreasing cost of living, particularly food expenditures (food prices were down by 65% in 1935 compared to 1928 price levels). Material conditions deprivation led to strikes, some of them violent or violently pacified \u2013 like in Sanok (March of the Hungry in Sanok\u00a0[pl] 6 March 1930), Lesko county (Lesko uprising 21 June \u2013 9 July 1932) and Zawiercie (Bloody Friday (1930)\u00a0[pl] 18 April 1930). To adapt to the crisis, Polish government employed deflation methods such as high interest rates, credit limits and budget austerity to keep a fixed exchange rate with currencies tied to the gold standard. Only in late 1932 did the government effect a plan to fight the economic crisis.[176] Part of the plan was mass public works scheme, employing up to 100,000 people in 1935.[174] After Pi\u0142sudski's death, in 1936 the gold standard regime was relaxed, and launching the development of the Central Industrial Region kicked off the economy, to over 10% annual growth rate in the 1936\u20131938 period."

The apparent economic success of the Soviet Union at a time when the capitalist world was in crisis led many Western intellectuals to view the Soviet system favorably. Jennifer Burns wrote: As the Great Depression ground on and unemployment soared, intellectuals began unfavorably comparing their faltering capitalist economy to Russian Communism. Karl Marx had predicted that capitalism would fall under the weight of its own contradictions, and now with the economic crisis gripping the West, his predictions seem to be coming true. By contrast Russia seemed an emblematic modern nation, making the staggering leap from a feudal past to an industrial future with ease.[187] The early years of the Great Depression caused mass immigration to the Soviet Union, including 10,000 to 15,000 from Finland and thousands more from Poland, Sweden, Germany, and other nearby countries. The Kremlin was at first happy to help these immigrants settle, believing that they were victims of capitalism who had come to help the Soviet cause. However, by 1933, the worst of the Depression had come to an end in many countries, and word had been received that illegal migrants to the Soviet Union were being sent to Siberia. These factors caused immigration to the Soviet Union to slow significantly, and roughly a tenth of Finnish migrants returned to Finland, either legally or illegally.[188]"

The world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain in 1931; investors around the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of \u00a32.5\u00a0million per day.[41] Credits of \u00a325\u00a0million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of \u00a315\u00a0million fiduciary note slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits by 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but King George V insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition \"National Government\". The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election, the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as prime minister for a largely Conservative coalition.[194][43] The effects on the northern industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating, as demand for traditional industrial products collapsed. By the end of 1930 unemployment had more than doubled from 1\u00a0million to 2.5\u00a0million (20% of the insured workforce), and exports had fallen in value by 50%. In 1933, 30% of Glaswegians were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry. In some towns and cities in the north east, unemployment reached as high as 70% as shipbuilding fell by 90%.[195] The National Hunger March of September\u2013October 1932 was the largest[196] of a series of hunger marches in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s. About 200,000 unemployed men were sent to the work camps, which continued in operation until 1939.[197] In the less industrial Midlands and Southern England, the effects were short-lived and the later 1930s were a prosperous time. Growth in modern manufacture of electrical goods and a boom in the motor car industry was helped by a growing southern population and an expanding middle class. Agriculture also saw a boom during this period.[198]"

        "content": "Hoover's first measures to combat the depression were based on encouraging businesses not to reduce their workforce or cut wages but businesses had little choice: wages were reduced, workers were laid off, and investments postponed.[199][200] In June 1930, Congress approved the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act which raised tariffs on thousands of imported items. The intent of the Act was to encourage the purchase of American-made products by increasing the cost of imported goods, while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers. Most countries that traded with the U.S. increased tariffs on American-made goods in retaliation, reducing international trade, and worsening the Depression.[201] In 1931, Hoover urged bankers to set up the National Credit Corporation[202] so that big banks could help failing banks survive. But bankers were reluctant to invest in failing banks, and the National Credit Corporation did almost nothing to address the problem.[203] By 1932, unemployment had reached 23.6%, peaking in early 1933 at 25%.[205] Those releasing from prison during this period had an especially difficult time finding employment given the stigma of their criminal records, which often led to recidivism out of economic desperation.[206] Drought persisted in the agricultural heartland, businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans, and more than 5,000 banks had failed.[207] Hundreds of thousands of Americans found themselves homeless, and began congregating in shanty towns \u2013 dubbed \"Hoovervilles\" \u2013 that began to appear across the country.[208] In response, President Hoover and Congress approved the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, to spur new home construction, and reduce foreclosures. The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act (ERA) which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) in 1932. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2\u00a0billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2\u00a0billion was not enough to save all the banks, and bank runs and bank failures continued.[199] Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill, as prices, profits and employment fell, leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Shortly after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933, drought and erosion combined to cause the Dust Bowl, shifting hundreds of thousands of displaced persons off their farms in the Midwest. From his inauguration onward, Roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be needed to prevent another depression or avoid prolonging the current one. New Deal programs sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms. During a \"bank holiday\" that lasted five days, the Emergency Banking Act was signed into law. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision, with federal loans available if needed. The Securities Act of 1933 comprehensively regulated the securities industry. This was followed by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which created the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although amended, key provisions of both Acts are still in force. Federal insurance of bank deposits was provided by the FDIC, and the Glass\u2013Steagall Act. The Agricultural Adjustment Act provided incentives to cut farm production in order to raise farming prices. The National Recovery Administration (NRA) made a number of sweeping changes to the American economy. It forced businesses to work with government to set price codes through the NRA to fight deflationary \"cut-throat competition\" by the setting of minimum prices and wages, labor standards, and competitive conditions in all industries. It encouraged unions that would raise wages, to increase the purchasing power of the working class. The NRA was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1935. These reforms, together with several other relief and recovery measures, are called the First New Deal. Economic stimulus was attempted through a new alphabet soup of agencies set up in 1933 and 1934 and previously extant agencies such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. By 1935, the \"Second New Deal\" added Social Security (which was later considerably extended through the Fair Deal), a jobs program for the unemployed (the Works Progress Administration, WPA) and, through the National Labor Relations Board, a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions. In 1929, federal expenditures constituted only 3% of the GDP. The national debt as a proportion of GNP rose under Hoover from 20% to 40%. Roosevelt kept it at 40% until the war began, when it soared to 128%. By 1936, the main economic indicators had regained the levels of the late 1920s, except for unemployment, which remained high at 11%, although this was considerably lower than the 25% unemployment rate seen in 1933. In the spring of 1937, American industrial production exceeded that of 1929 and remained level until June 1937. In June 1937, the Roosevelt administration cut spending and increased taxation in an attempt to balance the federal budget.[211]\nThe American economy then took a sharp downturn, lasting for 13 months through most of 1938. Industrial production fell almost 30 per cent within a few months and production of durable goods fell even faster. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938, rising from 5\u00a0million to more than 12\u00a0million in early 1938.[212] Manufacturing output fell by 37% from the 1937 peak and was back to 1934 levels.[213] Producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods, and inventories declined, but personal income was only 15% lower than it had been at the peak in 1937. As unemployment rose, consumers' expenditures declined, leading to further cutbacks in production. By May 1938 retail sales began to increase, employment improved, and industrial production turned up after June 1938.[214] After the recovery from the Recession of 1937\u201338, conservatives were able to form a bipartisan conservative coalition to stop further expansion of the New Deal and, when unemployment dropped to 2% in the early 1940s, they abolished WPA, CCC and the PWA relief programs. Social Security remained in place. Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditure tripled, and Roosevelt's critics charged that he was turning America into a socialist state.[215] The Great Depression was a main factor in the implementation of social democracy and planned economies in European countries after World War II (see Marshall Plan). Keynesianism generally remained the most influential economic school in the United States and in parts of Europe until the periods between the 1970s and the 1980s, when Milton Friedman and other neoliberal economists formulated and propagated the newly created theories of neoliberalism and incorporated them into the Chicago School of Economics as an alternative approach to the study of economics. Neoliberalism went on to challenge the dominance of the Keynesian school of Economics in the mainstream academia and policy-making in the United States, having reached its peak in popularity in the election of the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the United States, and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.[216]"

        "content": "And the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away. And that companion fact: when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need. And the little screaming fact that sounds through all history: repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed. \u2013John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath[217] The Great Depression has been the subject of much writing, as authors have sought to evaluate an era that caused both financial and emotional trauma. Perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939 and written by John Steinbeck, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the work, and in 1962 was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. The novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought, economic hardship, and changes in the agricultural industry occur during the Great Depression. Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is another important novella about a journey during the Great Depression. Additionally, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is set during the Great Depression. Margaret Atwood's Booker prize-winning The Blind Assassin is likewise set in the Great Depression, centering on a privileged socialite's love affair with a Marxist revolutionary. The era spurred the resurgence of social realism, practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs, especially the Federal Writers' Project in the U.S.[218][219][220][221] Nonfiction works from this time also capture important themes. The 1933 memoir Prison Days and Nights by Victor Folke Nelson provides insight into criminal justice ramifications of the Great Depression, especially in regard to patterns of recidivism due to lack of economic opportunity.[206] A number of works for younger audiences are also set during the Great Depression, among them the Kit Kittredge series of American Girl books written by Valerie Tripp and illustrated by Walter Rane, released to tie in with the dolls and playsets sold by the company. The stories, which take place during the early to mid 1930s in Cincinnati, focuses on the changes brought by the Depression to the titular character's family and how the Kittredges dealt with it.[222] A theatrical adaptation of the series entitled Kit Kittredge: An American Girl was later released in 2008 to positive reviews.[223][224] Similarly, Christmas After All, part of the Dear America series of books for older girls, take place in 1930s Indianapolis; while Kit Kittredge is told in a third-person viewpoint, Christmas After All is in the form of a fictional journal as told by the protagonist Minnie Swift as she recounts her experiences during the era, especially when her family takes in an orphan cousin from Texas.[225]"

        "content": "The term \"The Great Depression\" is most frequently attributed to British economist Lionel Robbins, whose 1934 book The Great Depression is credited with formalizing the phrase,[226] though Hoover is widely credited with popularizing the term,[226][227] informally referring to the downturn as a depression, with such uses as \"Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement\" (December 1930, Message to Congress), and \"I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression\" (1931). The term \"depression\" to refer to an economic downturn dates to the 19th century, when it was used by varied Americans and British politicians and economists. The first major American economic crisis, the Panic of 1819, was described by then-president James Monroe as \"a depression\",[226] and the most recent economic crisis, the Depression of 1920\u201321, had been referred to as a \"depression\" by then-president Calvin Coolidge. Financial crises were traditionally referred to as \"panics\", most recently the major Panic of 1907, and the minor Panic of 1910\u201311, though the 1929 crisis was called \"The Crash\", and the term \"panic\" has since fallen out of use. At the time of the Great Depression, the term \"The Great Depression\" was already used to refer to the period 1873\u201396 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873\u201379 (in the United States), which has retroactively been renamed the Long Depression.[228]"

        "content": "The worldwide economic decline after 2008 has been compared to the 1930s.[233][234][235][236][237] The causes of the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression, but significant differences exist. The then-chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, had extensively studied the Great Depression as part of his doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s. Bernanke's policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come, as economists debate the wisdom of his choices. In 2011, one journalist contrasted the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late-2000s recession.[238] If we contrast the 1930s with the Crash of 2008 where gold went through the roof, it is clear that the U.S. dollar on the gold standard was a completely different animal in comparison to the fiat free-floating U.S. dollar currency we have today. Both currencies in 1929 and 2008 were the U.S. dollar, but analogously it is as if one was a Saber-toothed tiger and the other is a Bengal tiger; they are two completely different animals. Where we have experienced inflation since the Crash of 2008, the situation was much different in the 1930s when deflation set in. Unlike the deflation of the early 1930s, the U.S. economy currently appears to be in a \"liquidity trap\", or a situation where monetary policy is unable to stimulate an economy back to health.\n\nIn terms of the stock market, nearly three years after the 1929 crash, the DJIA dropped 8.4% on 12 August 1932. Where we have experienced great volatility with large intraday swings in the past two months, in 2011, we have not experienced any record-shattering daily percentage drops to the tune of the 1930s. Where many of us may have that '30s feeling, in light of the DJIA, the CPI, and the national unemployment rate, we are simply not living in the '30s. Some individuals may feel as if we are living in a depression, but for many others the current global financial crisis simply does not feel like a depression akin to the 1930s. 1928 and 1929 were the times in the 20th century that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes;[239] half the unemployed had been out of work for over six months, something that was not repeated until the late-2000s recession. 2007 and 2008 eventually saw the world reach new levels of wealth gap inequality that rivalled the years of 1928 and 1929."

        "content": "The flood destroyed two-thirds of Laingsburg's infrastructure, destroying 184 houses and 23 commercial buildings, including the town's old-age home. The flood killed 104 people, with 72 bodies never recovered.[6] A report published in January 1982 identified the geographical position of Laingsburg as making it particularly vulnerable to large floods. Laingsburg is situated on a natural flood plain on the inside bend of the Buffels River. [7] Another geographical factor contributing to the damage was the confluence of the Buffels, Wilgehout, and Baviaans rivers, and the east-west ridge directly downstream (south) of the confluence.  The two large tributaries and the Buffels River converge immediately upstream of the poort (passage between mountains) through the ridge, and the ridge directed the flow in the tributaries northward into the southern part of town. The combined effects of all three rivers and the constriction of river by the poort accounted for much of the damage in the southern part of Laingsburg between Swartberg St and the river.[7] The deposition of sediment is a widespread form of flood damage in the drier regions of South Africa. Rivers in the Cape Midlands and the Karoo carry high sediment loads in high floods. The sediment-carrying capacity of flowing water depends on the velocity of the water. When the river overflows its banks, the velocity decreases as the water flows away from the river bed, particularly where it flows through a built-up area. The slower-moving water can no longer carry the sediment loads associated with the mid-stream velocities, and the sediment is deposited as the water slows down. Heavy sediment deposits result, especially in the vicinity of houses nearest to the enlarged river channel, where the flowing water's velocity is rapidly decreasing. Sediment deposits in Laingsburg were up to 3 m deep in many places and the total sediment volume deposited was about 200 000 cubic meters.[7] Another factor that caused much damage in Laingsburg was the large amount of floating debris. This consisted mainly of trees washed down the river from upstream, but it also included debris from buildings in the town itself. The debris caused physical damage to the buildings and aggravated sediment deposition.[7] Many buildings in Laingsburg collapsed due to high water levels alone. Those that collapsed were mainly the older buildings. Newer, more soundly constructed buildings were not seriously damaged except those subjected to high scouring velocities.[7]"

Extreme high storm surge in Finnmark estimated to be 50\u201380\u00a0cm (20\u201331\u00a0in) over normal sea levels, although this was due to the preceding storm Cato (Oliver). In Norway comparison was made with the New Year's Day Storm of 1992, however this storm was not as strong[14] Patrick (Dagmar) is believed to be the third strongest storm to hit Norway in 50 years.[15][16][17] \nA large landslide on 1 January 2012 close to the Norwegian city of Trondheim has been attributed to the warm weather and large amounts of rain the system brought to the area, which resulted in 50 people being evacuated.[18][19][dubious \u2013 discuss] The pier area of Trondheim was badly damaged during the storm, heavily damaging the fa\u00e7ade of the Pirbadet water park.[20] A F2 tornado was reported in Hellesylt, Norway. The Tanker BW Thames was disabled and adrift northwest of Bergen as the storm approached, however the crew were able to regain power and survived the storm without incident.[21] The Russian trawler Krasnoselsk sank in Hundeidvika harbour, Sykkylven, Norway.[22][23] Dagmar knocked out 390 Telenor communication masts leaving 40,000 customers without mobile or landline telephone connections.[2] Royal Dutch Shell's Ormen Lange gas processing plant was inoperable after its electricity was cut off by the storm, which left gas supplies in the UK vulnerable as this facility can supply up to 20 percent of the UK's supply via the Langeled pipeline.[24]"

During the year, a total of 146 tropical cyclones had formed. 88 tropical cyclones had been named by either a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) or a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC). The strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone was Hurricane Maria with a minimum barometric pressure of 908 mbar (hPa; 26.81\u00a0inHg) and killing 3,000 people in Puerto Rico and Dominica. The costliest tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Harvey in the Atlantic, which struck Houston metropolitan area in August causing US$125\u00a0billion in damage, tying with Hurricane Katrina as the costliest tropical cyclone worldwide. The most active basin in the year was the Western Pacific, which documented 27\u00a0named systems. However, the season had slightly below-average activity, and was the first season since 1977 to feature zero Category 5-equivalent super typhoons forming in the basin. The Eastern Pacific, despite amounting to 18 named systems, which constitutes above-average activity, was also significantly less active than the previous three Pacific hurricane seasons (2014, 2015 and 2016). However, the North Atlantic featured 17 named storms, and was the costliest tropical cyclone season on record. It also had the fifth-most named storms since reliable records began in 1851 \u2013 tied with 1936 \u2013 and the most major hurricanes since 2005. Activity across the southern hemisphere's three basins\u2014South-West Indian, Australian, and South Pacific\u2014was spread evenly, with each region recording seven named storms apiece, and with the most powerful cyclone, Cyclone Ernie, explosively intensifying to a Category 5 tropical cyclone. Two other Category 5 tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic, totalling to three  Category 5 tropical cyclones that formed during the year. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for the 2017 (seven basins combined), as calculated by Colorado State University (CSU) was 621.1 units, which was below the 1981-2010 mean of 770.2 units.[1][2][3]"

Over the next few months, these anomalies warmed and nearly reached the thresholds needed for an El Ni\u00f1o event to be declared, however, they subsequently cooled throughout the rest of the year and the 2017\u201318 La Ni\u00f1a event was declared to be underway. Scientists pointed out that the increase of CO2 emissions contributes to warmer ocean waters and more moist air for rain.[5] Because of sea level rise it is assumed that the storm surge of Hurricane Irma and other storms will cause greater flooding to vulnerable areas.[6][5] Data collected by NASA showed that ocean surface temperatures in the path of Irma were above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), capable of sustaining a Category 5 hurricane.[7]\nPrior to affecting the U.S. mainland, Miami's mayor Tom\u00e1s Regalado noted on Hurricane Irma, \"This is the time to talk about climate change. This is the time that the president and the EPA and whoever makes decisions needs to talk about climate change.\"[8] A day later the head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt said, \"..to discuss the cause and effect of these storms, there's the\u2026 place (and time) to do that, it's not now.\"[9] Following Irma's landfall, Donald Trump was asked about the connection between hurricanes and climate change, and stated that \"We\u2019ve had bigger storms than this.\"[10] Richard Branson who was directly impacted by hurricane Irma noted, \"..hurricanes are the start of things to come. Look, climate change is real. Ninety-nine per cent of scientists know it's real. The whole world knows it's real except for maybe one person in the White House.\"[11] United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres citing the devastation from hurricanes noted in September, \"The catastrophic Atlantic hurricane season has been made worse by climate change. Cutting carbon emissions must clearly be part of our response to the disaster. The rise in the surface temperature of the ocean has had an impact on weather patterns and we must do everything possible to bring it down.\"[12] The Associated Press looked at the yearly average accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), which accounts for wind speed and storm duration to assess hurricane power of the past 30 years and found it to be 41 percent higher than the previous 30 years. They asked several experts about their opinion, James Kossin from NOAA \"There's no question that the storms are stronger than they were 30 years ago.\" Climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, \"The only caveat being that the increase might be exaggerated somewhat because of undercounting early storms.\" Meteorologist Philip Klotzbach noted, \"What's happening with hurricanes \u2014 the frequency, the duration, and the energy \u2014 is probably a combination of factors caused by both nature and man, a mish-mosh of everything.\"[13] Kerry Emanuel who studies hurricanes, told the BBC, \"The warming of the climate has increased the underlying probabilities of very heavy rain events like happened in Harvey and very high category hurricanes like Irma. It is just not sensible to say either storm was caused by climate change, but the underlying probabilities are going up.\"[14]"

It was also the second consecutive above-average season since 2016 and the costliest season on record. Most of the damage was caused by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Hurricane Nate was considered the worst natural disaster in Costa Rican history. Due to the damage that the four hurricanes made, the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were retired by the WMO after the season.[15] The first named storm, Arlene, formed on April 19 as a subtropical depression. When Arlene was named on April 20, it became only the second named storm to form in April in the Atlantic, the other being Ana in 2003 and the strongest tropical cyclone on record in April. No storms formed in May. Throughout June and July, activity increased with Tropical Storms Bret, Cindy, Don, and Emily and Tropical Depression Four. Tropical Storm Bret was the earliest named storm to form in the Main Development Region, affecting Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago. Tropical Storm Cindy also existed throughout mid-June, affecting Louisiana. Together, both caused at least $28\u00a0million in damage and five deaths within the areas they affected. In July, tropical depression Four and tropical storms Don and Emily existed with the latter causing widespread floods throughout central Florida. Despite this activity within the first two months, most storms were weak or short-lived and resulted in the lowest ACE for the first five named storms on record, surpassing 1988.[16] In August, Hurricanes Franklin, Gert, Harvey, and Irma formed with the latter two causing catastrophic damage to the contiguous United States. Hurricane Harvey caused catastrophic flooding and was tied the costliest hurricane on record along with Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Harvey was also the wettest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the United States with a rainfall total of 60.58 inches in Nederland, Texas. Hurricane Irma caused a trail of damage from the Leeward Islands to Florida, causing $77.2\u00a0billion in damage, and became the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the Leeward Islands. In September, copious activity occurred with Hurricanes Jose, Katia, Lee, and Maria, with the latter becoming the tenth most intense hurricane on record. Along with the four systems, Irma also persisted through early September, making it and Maria the first Category 5 hurricanes to occur within the same month. Hurricane Maria caused catastrophic damage to Puerto Rico and Dominica with over 3,000 fatalities and $91.606\u00a0billion in damage. Accumulated cyclone energy also increased rapidly during this month, resulting in three hurricanes achieving an ACE over 40, the first on record to do so, September 8 becoming the most active day on record based on ACE, and Hurricane Irma achieving the third-highest ACE on record in the Atlantic with 64.9 units.[17] By October, activity still persisted although the potential for a La Ni\u00f1a would begin peaking by November. Hurricane Nate became the worst natural disaster in Costa Rican history as a precursor, while Ophelia became the worst tropical cyclone to affect Ireland in 50 years. Philippe was a short-lived system that contributed to a bomb cyclone shortly after its dissipation. Finally, Tropical Storm Rina became the last storm to form in this basin, dissipating on November 9. The extratropical remnants of this system later contributed to Cyclone Numa (or Storm Zenon), which affected Greece, Italy, France, Tunisia, and Turkey and caused the worst weather event in Greece since 1977. The season ended on November 30."

Unlike the three previous hyperactive seasons (2014, 2015, and 2016), the season was significantly less active in terms of ACE and most storms that existed through this basin were either weak or short-lived. Early May saw the formation of Tropical Storm Adrian, which was the earliest named tropical cyclone to exist east of 140\u00b0W at the time; it was surpassed by Tropical Storm Andres in 2021.[18] Throughout June and July, the basin saw some considerable activity, with the latter month having the fifth-highest ACE in the Eastern Pacific.[19] Storms that existed during this time include Hurricanes Dora, Eugene, Fernanda, Hilary, Irwin, Tropical Storms Beatriz, Calvin, and Greg, and Tropical Depression Eight-E, which contributed to the ACE count throughout the earlier parts of the season. Throughout August and September, activity decreased significantly, but stagnated in terms of named storms with some being short-lived. For example, in September, only four named storms formed (Otis, Max, Norma and Pilar) and October featured tropical storms Ramon and Selma, in which none attained hurricane status. Selma became the first named storm to make landfall in El Salvador[20] and also contributed to the formation of Philippe in the Atlantic. No storms have formed in November since 2010. In the Central Pacific, no storms have formed since 2011. The season began on June 1 and both seasons ended on November 30, 2017."

The first half of the season was relatively inactive, with only seven systems developing, of which only two intensified into tropical storms. The first system of 2017 developed on January 7, and was named Auring by PAGASA. Tropical Depression Bising developed during the first week of February, and was a factor in, and worsened the effects of, the 2017 Visayas and Mindanao floods. This was followed by Crising, the third system unofficially named by PAGASA. Heavy rains from the depression caused flooding that led to the deaths of 10 people in Cebu, Philippines. Shortly after the dissipation of Crising came the formation of the first tropical storm of the season \u2013 Muifa. The system was not strong, however, and was located away from all major land areas, so it caused no damage. No systems formed during the month of May, the first such occurrence since 2013. The next cyclone, Merbok, formed during mid-June, and made landfall in Shenzhen in China. The cyclone was short-lived; however, it was relatively strong, producing winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) at its peak. Nanmadol passed over the Ryukyu Islands and progressed to make landfall in Nagasaki on Japan's island of Kyushu during early July. Torrential rainfall and strong winds from the cyclone itself and from the stormy weather that persisted for a number of days were responsible for major damage and 41 fatalities across mainland Japan. By the middle of July, tropical activity had increased with simultaneous tropical storms developing after July 14. Severe Tropical Storm Talas formed during mid-July near the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, and traveled generally westwards. It made landfall in Vietnam after brushing China's Hainan province and, unusually, continued to track far inland to the Laos\u2013Thailand border before weakening to a depression. At least 14 deaths were attributed to the storm, primarily as a result of flooding. Later, the season was very active with 7 storms in late July-early August. Typhoon Noru reached Category 4 super typhoon in peak intensity and made landfall in Japan, causing $100\u00a0million in damage. Tropical Storm Sonca made landfall in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb, Vietnam; 2017 was the first year since 1971 where 2 storms made landfall in Central Vietnam in July. Sonca brought heavy rainfall in Northeast Thailand and caused extreme flooding in the region with estimated costs of over US$300\u00a0million. Typhoon Nesat and Tropical storm Haitang made landfall in Taiwan and Fujian (a province in China), respectively, 2 days apart. In mid-late August, Typhoon Hato and Tropical Storm Pakhar made landfall in Macau and Guangdong respectively while they were at peak intensity. So far Typhoon Hato is the costliest tropical cyclone in Northwest Pacific in 2017 with damages totalling $6.82\u00a0billion. The season was weaker in September. Typhoon Talim made landfall in Japan as a minimal typhoon and caused US$700\u00a0million in damage. Typhoon Doksuri made landfall in Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh, Vietnam as a Category 3 typhoon; damage was very major as the total was estimated at over US$814\u00a0million. In early October a tropical depression made landfall in Northern and North Central Vietnam, which brought very heavy rainfall and was responsible for the worst flooding in Northern and North-Central Vietnam, with 109 deaths and total damages of over US$570\u00a0million. Later, Typhoon Khanun made landfall in Southern China. So far Typhoon Lan has been the strongest tropical cyclone in the basin in 2017, and became the second largest tropical cyclone on record. In November, La Ni\u00f1a was returned and tropical activity had increased with simultaneous tropical storms developing, and most of them moved west and affected Philippines and Vietnam. Typhoon Damrey made landfall in Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a, Vietnam and became one of the costliest typhoon in Vietnamese history since 1975; and it is one of the costliest and deadliest typhoon in the basin in 2017 with total damage reached US$1.03\u00a0billion and 151 deaths. Later, two weak storms affected Philippines. In December, Tropical storm Kai-tak caused flooding in Central Philippines. Typhoon Tembin was responsible for severe flooding and landslides in South Philippines, it became the deadliest tropical cyclone in 2017 with over 250 deaths. Typhoon Tembin moved South into the China Sea, so 2017 became the most active tropical cyclone season in the South China Sea with 22 Tropical cyclones, and Tembin affected Southern Vietnam."

This season produced only three named storms, of which one only intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm. The season officially had an early start compared with the last two seasons, with the formation of Cyclone Maarutha over the Bay of Bengal in mid-April. Cyclone Mora, formed in late May over the Bay of Bengal. At its peak intensity, it was equivalent to a marginal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. The cyclone produced severe flooding across Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar and Bangladesh and caused 15 deaths directly and 208 deaths indirectly. The floods persisted in Bangladesh since a Deep Depression over Bay of Bengal made landfall and killed 156 people in Bangladesh. A depression formed in northwestern Bay of Bengal and produced torrential rainfall. It was followed by a depression over Jharkhand which killed 70 people in West Bengal. Under the influence of strong monsoon surge a disturbance developed over Bay of Bengal travelled westwards and intensified to an unnamed depression. It also affected neighboring Karachi in Pakistan. A strong monsoon surge prevented formation of systems until a deep depression formed over West Bengal in October and caused heavy rainfall. A couple of depressions formed between mid-October and November which continued the rain spell causing destruction of life and property. Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Ockhi formed in early December and wreaked havoc in the countries where it impacted. It was equivalent to a strong Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale at peak intensity. The twin storm of Ockhi was a deep depression which originated in Bay of Bengal while its counterpart was in Arabian Sea."

Barra was also the reason for one of Navarre in Spain's worst floods in two decades. A surface low first developed over the Atlantic Ocean, which would eventually become Barra. This system rapidly intensified owing to approaching Ireland, bottoming from 1,010\u00a0to 956 hectopascals (29.8\u201328.2\u00a0inHg) in just 24 hours.[1] It then impacted the country, before weakening and moving through the United Kingdom. As it entered the North Sea, it further degraded and was absorbed by the frontal system of \"Justus\", an extratropical cyclone named by the Free University of Berlin (FUB). Barra caused widespread preparations in Ireland and the UK. Schools were canceled, and weather alerts were placed for the possible areas to be affected by the impeding cyclone. COVID-19 test drives, along with hospital operations in the former were also disrupted. The strongest wind gust reported from the storm was 115\u00a0km/h (32\u00a0m/s) in Sherkin Island. Different properties were damaged, and trees were felled in Ireland, and also in the UK, where snow impacted areas of Scotland. Over 59,000 households also lost electricity. The storm also caused devastating floods in Spain, where one was killed. Overall, one death each was confirmed in Ireland, the UK and Spain, respectively and the damages were unknown."

On 16 January, the storm developed-hurricane-force winds and Eric began to undergo rapid deepening. While two different agencies differ on when and how strong Eric was at its peak, it was believed to have peaked on 17 January while passing through the Fiji island group. Shortly after its peak, Eric began to weaken steadily, and by 20 January, Severe Tropical Cyclone Eric had ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone. Combined with another storm \u2013 Cyclone Nigel \u2013 Eric caused 25 fatalities and $40 million (1985 USD) worth of damage. A total of 299 farms were affected as well as the airport in Nadi. About 30,000 people were left homeless. Severe crop damage was also reported. Viti Levu sustained the worst effects from Cyclone Eric. During the aftermath of the storm, a number of first world countries distributed aid for victims of Eric."

All ships moved out of the port of Suva and took shelter elsewhere. In addition, the Nadi airport was closed and flights were diverted away from Fiji. Residents took shelter wherever they could to survive the storm.[9] Affecting a densely populated part of the island group,[10] Eric brought $40 million (USD) in damage and took 25 lives.[11] Extensive wind damage was reported; crop damage from Eric was also severe.[12] Over 200\u00a0mm (10\u00a0in) of rainfall fell in some places, resulting in extensive flooding. The combined systems destroyed 9,500 homes; many schools, shops and, hotels had to be rebuilt because of the storm.[9] Many recreational facilities as well as may commercial builds were also party or completely destroyed by the cyclone.[11] About 30,000 persons were reported as homeless.[13] A total of 299 farms were affecting by the storm, resulting in nearly $2 million in damage; however damage to the pine plantations was minor.[10] Across Viti Levu, serious damage was reported. The Nadi airport was closed during the storm;[12] four days after the passage of Eric, the airport re-opened for night operations. Damage from the airport alone totaled $1 million.[13] The west part of Viti Levu as well as some other surrounding islands sustained the worst damage, though interior areas of Viti Levu suffered from severe crop damage.[10]"

The eighth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands on August\u00a028. Initially, the storm struggled to intensify due to moderate wind shear as it moved westwards towards the Bahamas. By August 31, Hanna had drifted southwards and began intensifying while over the Bahamas; it attained its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane while over the Turks and Caicos Islands. Due to the outflow of the nearby Hurricane Gustav, Hanna weakened back into a tropical storm the next day as it began to drift northwestwards towards the Southeastern United States. The storm struck Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, before moving up the Eastern Seaboard to become an extratropical cyclone as it moved by New England into Atlantic Canada early on September\u00a07. The system raced across the North Atlantic, sweeping west of Great Britain on September\u00a010 before turning north and becoming absorbed by a stronger extratropical cyclone between Iceland and Greenland late on September\u00a012. At least 537 deaths were reported (the final death toll will likely never be known), mostly due to flooding in the northern part of Haiti. Hanna also caused $160\u00a0million in damages to the U.S., but the exact damage in Haiti is unknown. Despite the high number of deaths caused by the hurricane, the name Hanna was not retired."

        "content": "On August 19, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. After several days, an associated area of low pressure gained deep convection and organization. On August\u00a028, while to the east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, the low formed into Tropical Depression Eight. Later that day, it attained tropical storm status, and as such was named Hanna by the National Hurricane Center.[1] At the time, the low-level center of circulation was partially exposed on the western edge of the mass of convection, indicating westerly wind shear.[2] Tracking westward primarily under the steering current of a large ridge to the north, the convective pattern began to redevelop late on August\u00a028. Since forecast, models predicted the storm would weaken and move southwestward due to outflow associated with nearby Hurricane Gustav. Despite this, the storm began entering a favorable environment, and was forecast to intensify.[3] An upper-level low that had been producing wind shear moved away from the system, though light shear continued. At the same time, the low-level center once again became separated from the convection, which was primarily confined to a cyclonic banding feature in the eastern half of the circulation.[4] It remained weak as it moved erratically westward while east of the Bahamas on August\u00a030. Due to the influence of Hurricane Gustav's large circulation, Hanna suddenly took a sharp southerly turn and slowed down to drift while located to the north of the Turks and Caicos Islands.[5] On September\u00a01, as Hanna drifted to the south-southwest, convection increased and the storm began to intensify.[6] Later that day around 1:30\u00a0pm EDT, an Air Force Reconnaissance Aircraft found winds within Hanna supportive of hurricane strength, and the National Hurricane Center upgraded Hanna to a hurricane.[7] Early on September\u00a02, strong wind shear in association with Hurricane Gustav began to affect Hanna and the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm on September\u00a03. Hanna then sharply turned back northward, causing additional damage in Haiti. Over the course of the next three days, Hanna slighted northwestward towards the Bahamas, before turning abruptly north. By September 5, Hanna turned westward towards the Carolinas.[8]\nEarly on September\u00a06, 2008, Hanna made landfall near the South Carolina-North Carolina border.[9]  The system became an extratropical cyclone as it moved into Atlantic Canada early on September\u00a07 and raced across the North Atlantic, sweeping west of Great Britain on September\u00a010 before turning north and becoming absorbed by a stronger extratropical cyclone between Iceland and Greenland late on September\u00a012.[10]"

Classes resumed regular schedules on Monday, September\u00a08.[citation needed] Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, canceled all class and activities on Friday and Saturday and issued a mandatory evacuation due to fears of a power outage. The College of William & Mary and Old Dominion University nearby had not made any similar plans. Old Dominion University and nearby neighboring school Norfolk State University did cancel classes for both Friday afternoon, and Saturday, due to the possibilities of heavy rain and wind.[17][18] Two other Hampton Roads schools, Regent University and Virginia Wesleyan College, did not close on Friday, but Regent closed completely on Saturday,[19] while Virginia Wesleyan canceled classes on Saturday but otherwise remained open.[20] On Friday, September\u00a05, NASCAR announced that they would postpone the NASCAR Nationwide Series Emerson Radio 250 (scheduled to be run that evening) and the next day's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Chevy Rock and Roll 400 until Sunday afternoon after Hanna had moved north of Virginia. Both races were held at the Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, Virginia. With a delay in the storm during the day on September\u00a06, the US Open tennis tournament went on, but was eventually canceled as the rains came. Nearby at Shea Stadium, the baseball game between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies was cancelled in advance of the storm, rescheduled as a day-night doubleheader on September\u00a07.[21] The game between the Baltimore Orioles and Oakland Athletics was cancelled due to the storm.[22] Power companies on Long Island were preparing for a minimal hurricane and the first real test of New York's readiness for a strong storm impacting the region.

Nearly the entire city was flooded with water as high as 2\u00a0meters (6.6\u00a0feet) deep, and some people had to be rescued on their roofs.[30] In Les Cayes, a hospital had to be evacuated as it was swamped by flood water. At least 5,000\u00a0people there were moved to public shelters due to the flooding.[31] The United Nations have ordered relief convoys to the hard-hit region, including rafts to help rescue victims.[32] As of late on September\u00a04, Haiti's government said the death toll from Tropical Storm Hanna had increased to at least 529, with most of the deaths coming in the flooded port city of Gona\u00efves, where the destruction was described as \"catastrophic\" and 495 bodies were discovered as of late on September\u00a05.[25][33] Haitian authorities said the tally could grow once officials are able to make their way through Gona\u00efves. \"The assessment is only partial, because it is impossible to enter the city for the moment\", Gona\u00efves Mayor Stephen Moise said.[34]\nIn the aftermath of Hanna at least 48,000 from the Gona\u00efves areas went to shelters. Some people slept on the roofs of their house to protect them from looters. The catastrophe left many homeless\nand begging for food and clothes. Others left for the mountains hoping to wait out the next storms on the horizon.[35]\nHaitians became aggravated at the lack of assistance in the wake of Hanna, with very little aid coming from international organizations.\nBridges north and south of Gona\u00efves collapsed, with roads in the vicinity of the area transformed into swamps.[35] Over a week after Hanna brushed the Dominican Republic, the body of a fisherman who drowned in the storm was found in the Atlantic just off the northern coast.[26]"

Around 300 millimetres (12\u00a0in) of rain, threefold the monthly average for September, was recorded during 24 hours on 10\u201311 September.[1][2] Nearly 190\u00a0mm (7.5\u00a0in) fell in the space of two hours in the morning of 11 September.[3][1] Outside Zadar, flooding occurred in Sali and Suko\u0161an.[4] The town of Nin was the worst hit, as the floodwaters overwhelmed its embankment,[5] and a state of emergency was declared there.[4] There were no fatalities. The flood caused an estimated 322\u00a0million Croatian kuna in damage (\u20ac43\u00a0million). Numerous houses, apartments and institutions were damaged, including Zadar cemetery, hospitals, roads and a shopping mall.[4] The torrent damaged the frame of an apartment complex in construction.[6] The roads Zadar\u2013Ra\u017eanac and Poljica-Brig \u2013 Nin were washed out.[7] Zadar's water treatment plant suffered 10\u00a0million kuna in damage, while the cost to repair roads was estimated to be over 4\u00a0million kuna.[5] The salt ponds in Nin lost the year's salt harvest to the flood.[8] The rainfall and flooding was caused by the terrain surrounding the city. Zadar, a coastal city, lies in the flat region of Ravni Kotari. However, the Velebit mountain range extends along the coast behind Ravni Kotari, and caused the storms arriving from Tyrrhenian Sea in the west to undergo orographic lift and continually produce rain while passing over Zadar.[4][9] The mesoscale convective system responsible for the flood spanned over 400 kilometres (250\u00a0mi) east\u2013west, and reached a temperature of \u221265\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221285\u00a0\u00b0F) at the cloud tops. Over 25,000 lightning strikes were recorded near Zadar. 285\u00a0mm (11.2\u00a0in) of rain fell in Zadar proper, while 325\u00a0mm (12.8\u00a0in) was recorded in nearby Zemunik.[1] While the rainfall amount was extremely high, it did not break Zemunik's daily record of 352.2\u00a0mm (13.87\u00a0in), which was set during the flood of 11 September 1986.[1] On 11 September 2017, Zadar was pronounced to have recorded the most rainfall of all meteorological stations on earth for this date, beating out rainfall totals caused by Hurricane Irma in Florida, while Gospi\u0107 was placed 8th.[10][11][12] However, the data was later corrected to include a higher total for Alabat Island, Philippines,[11] due to Tropical Storm Maring."

It was caused when a combination of the tide and high winds from the extratropical storm Martin led to overwhelming of the seawalls of the Blayais Nuclear Power Plant in France.[1] The event resulted in the loss of the plant's off-site power supply and knocked out several safety-related systems, resulting in a Level 2 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale.[2] The incident illustrated the potential for flooding to damage multiple items of equipment throughout a plant, weaknesses in safety measures, systems and procedures, and resulted in fundamental changes to the evaluation of flood risk at nuclear power plants and in the precautions taken.[1][3] It was in some sense a forerunner of the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents in Japan, but did not trigger the worldwide protection work on low-lying plants that the latter would."

        "content": "The Blayais plant, equipped with four pressurized water reactors, is located on the Gironde estuary near Blaye, South Western France, and is operated by \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France. Due to records of over 200 floods along the estuary dating back to 585 AD, some 40 of which had been particularly extensive, the location of the plant was known to be susceptible to flooding, and reports of the 1875 floods mentioned that they were caused by a combination of a high tides and violent winds blowing along the axis of the estuary.[4] The area had also experienced flooding during storms in the recent past, on December 13, 1981 and March 18, 1988.[4] An official report on the 1981 floods, published in 1982,[5] noted that it 'would be dangerous to underestimate' the combined effects of tide and storm, and also noted that the wind had led to 'the formation of real waves on the lower flooded floodplain'.[4] When the Blayais plant was designed in the 1970s, it was on the basis that a height of 4.0\u00a0m (13.1\u00a0ft) above NGF level would provide an 'enhanced safety level', and the base on which the plant was built was set at 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) above NGF,[4] although some components were located in basements at lower levels. The protective sea walls around the Blayais plant were originally built to be 5.2\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft) above NGF level at the front of the site, and 4.75\u00a0m (15.6\u00a0ft) along the sides.[6] The 1998 annual review of plant safety for the plant identified the need for the sea walls to be raised to 5.7\u00a0m (19\u00a0ft) above NGF, and envisaged that this would be carried out in 2000, although EDF later postponed the work until 2002.[6] On 29 November 1999, the Regional Directorate for Industry, Research and the Environment sent a letter to EDF asking them to explain this delay.[6]"

        "content": "The Institute for Nuclear Protection and Safety issued a report on January 17, 2000, calling for a review of the data used to calculate the height of the surface on which nuclear power stations are built. It suggested that two criteria should be met: that buildings containing equipment important for safety should be built on a surface at least as high as the highest water level plus a safety margin (the cote major\u00e9e de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 or 'enhanced safety height'), and that any such buildings below this level should be sealed to prevent water ingress.[6] It also contained an initial analysis which found that, in addition to Blayais, the plants as Belleville, Chinon, Dampierre, Gravelines and Saint-Laurent were all below the 'enhanced safety height' and that their safety measures should be re-examined.[6] It also found that although the plants at Bugey, Cruas, Flamanville, Golfech, Nogent, Paluel, Penly and Saint-Alban met the first criterion, the second should be verified; and called for the plants at Fessenheim and Tricastin to be re-examined since they were below the level of major adjacent canals.[6] The consequent upgrading work, implemented over the following years, is estimated to have cost approximately 110,000,000 euro.[3] In Germany, the flooding prompted the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety to order an evaluation of the German nuclear power plants.[1] Following the events at Blayais, a new method of evaluating flood risk was developed. Instead of evaluating only the five factors required by Rule RFS I.2.e (river flood, dam failure, tide, storm surge and tsunami), a further eight factors are now also evaluated: waves caused by wind on the sea; waves caused by wind on river or channel; swelling due to the operation of valves or pumps; deterioration of water retaining structures (other than dams); circuit or equipment failure; brief and intense rainfall on site; regular and continuous rainfall on site; and rises in groundwater. In addition, realistic combinations of such factors are taken into account.[3] Among the remedial actions taken at Blayais itself, the sea walls were raised to 8.0\u00a0m (26.2\u00a0ft) above NFG,[4] \u2013 up to 3.25\u00a0m (10.7\u00a0ft) higher than before \u2013 and openings have been sealed to prevent water ingress.[3]"

The adequacy of the sea walls has, however, been disputed by Professor Jean-No\u00ebl Salomon, head of the Laboratory of Applied Physical Geography at Michel de Montaigne University Bordeaux 3. He believes that, due to the potential harm and economic cost that would result from a future flood-related disaster, the sea walls should be designed to withstand simultaneous extreme events, rather than simultaneous major events.[4]"

Beas Bhakra Management Board was accused and held responsible for triggering off the flood by releasing the waters from dam which burst the banks. B. N. Kumar, chairman of Bhakra Beas Management Board, was shot dead by militants as a revenge of Beas Bhakra Management Board's role in floods.[2][3] 9,000 of Punjab's 12,989 villages were flooded, of which over 2,500 were completely marooned or simply washed away. This was the biggest flood in Punjab's history as it disrupted the lives of over 34 lakh people.  As people were trying to survive and manage, the Union Agriculture Minister Bhajan Lai infamously said that the floods were a blessing in disguise - his logic being that it would increase Punjab's ground water level.[1]"

The WPC later upgraded the risk to a \"Slight Risk\", as the confidence increased in the potential for flash flooding, exacerbated by heavy antecedent rainfall on April\u00a011.[10] A flood watch was issued for southeastern Florida during this time.[11] Rainfall spread across south central Florida, throughout the morning of April\u00a012. This was happening in advance of a slow, northward-progressing warm front. The local atmospheric environment was conducive to heavier precipitation rates, bearing precipitable water amounts near the climatological maxima for the region (approximately 1.7\u20131.9\u00a0in (43\u201348\u00a0mm)). Heavier showers and thunderstorms embedded in the largely stratiform rains grew during the morning.[12] The combination of the morning rainfall and rain from preceding days saturated the soils in Broward and Miami-Dade counties to the point that only 1.5\u20132.0\u00a0in (38\u201351\u00a0mm) of rain would need to fall in an hour to produce flash flooding according to flash flood guidance.[13] The moist conditions persisted into the afternoon and evening, enabling the highly efficient production of rainfall in the storms as the warm front progressed north of Key Largo and into the Miami area. By around 5:30\u00a0p.m. EDT, 2\u20136\u00a0in (51\u2013152\u00a0mm) of rain had fallen across the Miami metropolitan area.[14] During the evening hours, stationary thunderstorms caused torrential rainfall over Fort Lauderdale, fueled by the locally moist atmosphere and a persistent inflow drawing moisture from the Atlantic towards the Florida coast.[15] National Weather Service Miami, Florida, issued a flash flood emergency at 7:58\u00a0p.m. EDT for Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood highlighting the potential for 2\u20134\u00a0in (51\u2013102\u00a0mm) of additional rainfall atop the 10\u201312\u00a0in (250\u2013300\u00a0mm) of rain that had already fallen.[16] The cluster of storms began to weaken by around 11:00\u00a0p.m. EDT after dropping 10\u201320\u00a0in (250\u2013510\u00a0mm) of rain in the Fort Lauderdale area.[17] The day's storms also produced two brief tornadoes in Broward County, each producing EF0-rated damage; the first one touched down near West Hollywood at 3:26\u00a0p.m. EDT while the second touched down near Dania Beach at 9:41\u00a0p.m. EDT. The combination of wind shear, interaction between the warm front and the coast, and enhanced convection and vorticity resulting from the aggregation of thunderstorms may have produced conducive conditions for the development of tornadoes.[18]"

The floods demolished most of the city, destroying over 1,500 homes and impacting 495 families according to ANDMA.[10] The vast majority of displaced families are typically sheltered by other relatives or nearby communities while they wait for the rain, and subsequent floods or landslides, to subside.[11] Houses are often built in areas prone to flooding. The density of many cities, in conjunction with the rapidity with which floods occur, increase the deadliness of the natural disaster.

The number of casualties/people affected varied depending on the province where the flooding occurred, with political strife and other social issues impacting the numbers of missing persons and casualties reported.[29][32] In April 2020, OCHA estimated that 17,000 people had been affected by flooding until that point in Afghanistan.[29] As flooding continued well into August of that same year, numbers are most likely greater. Other additional short-term impacts from the flooding were housing loss, agricultural land/crop losses, and displacement.[29] With a high quantity of people leaving the flooded areas and staying in neighboring communities until they could return to their homes, COVID-19 transmission was greater in the provinces affected by flooding.[30]  Short-term impacts such as housing and crop losses also often transmute into long-term issues, such as an increase in economic instability (and lack of access to proper healthcare), malnutrition, and lack of access to sanitary water sources (affecting the spread of communicable diseases).[33] Natural (and human-impacted) disasters increase the percentages of premature \u201cYears of Life Lost\u201d, even when death was not the initial short-term impact.[34] In regard to children, they face serious physical and mental health impacts when losing a parent as immediate loss of economic stability, food safety, and shelter generate a multitude of physical and mental health issues, both short- and long-term.[35] Organizations such as NATO and OCHA have worked to assist with these issues impacting local people from the flooding and various plans have been proposed for disaster risk management in the area to prevent future issues.[36][37]"

Providing care for the ill presents challenges in the remote provinces under normal circumstances, as the world bank notes clinics are understaffed and resources are scarce.[39]  In the wake of the floods it became increasingly difficult as the population became more unstable. Another long-term health impact of the 2020 flooding can be attributed to the destruction of poorly built housing in the provinces affected. The lack of a stable living environment and deaths associated with building collapses due to flash flooding took an additional emotional toll on a population already ravaged by both uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreaks and war.[40] It is estimated that 50% of the afghan population has mental health issues, with the rural populations affected by the flooding at increased risk.[41] To compound and already poor situation, access to mental health services remains an issue in the country, with less than 10% of afghans having access to services.[42]"

On 15 March, the storm attained wind speeds more than 56 kilometres per hour (35\u00a0mph) and was designated as Tropical Cyclone 28S.[2] On 16 March, at 3:00 PM, the storm had intensified into a tropical cyclone and was designate as Tropical Cyclone Elaine.[1][2][3] Elaine changed course and headed southward, towards Western Australia at 11 knots (20\u00a0km/h; 13\u00a0mph).[3] Elaine's winds reached 60\u00a0mph, attaining Category 1 status. The system underwent explosive intensification[2] and reached severe tropical storm status on 17 March. An eye was evident which was associated with the rapid intensification. Cyclone Elaine reached its peak the same day at 10:00 UTC.[3][2] Thereafter the storm declined as it headed south towards westerly wind shear.[2][1] Elaine continued west on 18 March, and made landfall at 10:00 UTC.[2][3] Elaine then dropped to tropical storm status, with deep convection being stripped away from the system. Elaine declined over Western Australia as a remnant low. The low continued to impact Western Australia until Elaine dissipated on 20 March, around 12:00 UTC."

The southern portion of the wave separated and continued to move westward across the Caribbean and crossed Central America during August 27 and August 28.[1] Later a trough with a weak low pressure area developed over southern Mexico, The area of low pressure was found embedded within a large area of scattered moderate and isolated strong convection.[2] The initial low failed to develop[3] but a new low formed on western side of the trough. A larger cyclonic circulation associated with the trough and induced a gradual increase in deep convection.[4] The low level convection center was temporarily displaced from the convection, and a smaller embedded circulation developed and was eventually detached from the larger circulation. It is estimated that a tropical depression formed at 1200 UTC 6 September when it was centered about 310\u00a0mi (500\u00a0km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico.[5] As convective banding formed, the depression gradually intensified and was upgraded a Tropical Storm Lowell six hours later.[6] A deep-layer anticyclone over Mexico steered Lowell northwestward until September 8. However, strong upper-level winds on the south side of the anticyclone produced strong northeasterly to easterly wind shear over the tropical cyclone for several days. Due to the shear, the low level convection became exposed and sheared. despite this, Lowell slowly strengthened and reached a peak intensity of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), it then passed near Socorro Island without any known damage. The shear had lessened over the system, but with stable and dry air, the storm begin to weaken.[7] Lowell moved towards north and northeast due to a subtropical ridge northwest of the system. It downgraded to a tropical depression at 0600 UTC 10 September as it was moving north-northeastward about 259\u00a0mi (417\u00a0km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California.[8] Thunderstorm activity near the center had increased slightly on 10 September. The circulation began to slowly spin down as it made landfall around Cabo San Lucas, Mexico at 0900 UTC 11 September.[9]  As it made landfall the mid to upper level winds left the low level center exposed form the thunderstorm activity. Lowell degenerated into an elongated surface trough that extended across the southern Gulf of California.[10] It followed a squall line and a frontal boundary and quickly dissipated. The remnant low produced rain across Northwestern Mexico, it later joined Hurricane Ike and caused damage further inland.[1]"

Rosario is traversed by the Ludue\u00f1a Stream in the north; its southern border is partly defined by the Saladillo Stream. The Ludue\u00f1a has historically been prone to overflowing, which has prompted the construction of works (canals and piping) to contain and derive its waters. Soon after the beginning of the rain, the Ibarlucea Canal (which empties into the main course of the Ludue\u00f1a, overflowed and flooded several neighbourhoods in the northwest of Rosario. At the peak of the crisis, on 31 March, about 4,000 people were evacuated in several emergency centers throughout the city. As the strong rain started to subside in Rosario, the storms were moving north towards the area of Santa Fe, the provincial capital. Santa Fe is built on low-lying terrain at the junction of the Salado and Paran\u00e1 rivers, and is still recovering from a flood caused by the Salado in 2003. This time, however, both rivers were rising. At some point, the physical barriers that had been set in place against the rise of the Paran\u00e1 River prevented the natural drainage of the flood waters brought by the Salado. The existing pumps were not enough, and there was a delay bringing extra ones. As the neighbouring areas were flooded and the incoming roads submerged or damaged, Santa Fe became practically isolated with the exception of the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel. About 20,000 people were displaced or evacuated. The provincial government decreed a state of hydrical emergency on 29 March. Evacuees were sent to military and private facilities (such as sports clubs and schools), where they were given food and shelter, and the risk population (mainly children) was vaccinated. After the end of the emergency, as the first estimates of the damages were released, the provincial government set aside funds (620 million Argentine pesos, about 200 million USD) to assist the affected towns and cities; of these, AR$30 million were assigned to each of Santa Fe City and Rosario."

It started during heavy rains in 2004, and came to a head in January, when sustained heavy rains and high tides over-topped the deteriorating water conservancy.  Approximately 290,000 people (39% of Guyana's population) were affected and the economic impact was estimated to be about US$465 million, or 59% of Guyana's GDP.[1]"

The population centers along the coast is locked between the Atlantic Ocean (north) and a series of storage reservoirs (conservancies) to the south. Flood waters are drained via a complex drainage system either by pumping, or at low tide; when the sea level is low enough to allow for gravity-based release through a number of sluices. Guyana has two rainfall seasons, triggered by the north\u2013south movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone: one from April to July, and secondary season from November to February.[2] Starting in late December 2004, Guyana was hit by heavy rains. Flooding is not uncommon in the lowland coastal areas, and flooding was reported in areas such as Ogle and Sophia well into January.[3] The Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis at NASA monitored rainfall between December 24, 2004, and January 20, 2005. The \"highest rainfall totals on the order of 20 inches of rain (red areas) occur just offshore and right along the coastline of Guyana near the mouth of the Essequibo River and Georgetown\". The three distinct episodes of rainfall \"resulted in some coastal areas of Guyana receiving upwards of 100 cm (40 inches) of rainfall\u2014the most rainfall for a similar period in over 100 years\".[4]"

East Demerara Water Conservancy was unable to contain the water and flood waters peaked around January 17, when a high Lunar tide and unusually heavy rains hit the area. The water conservancy was overloaded, and local drainage systems were inadequate to bear any additional burden. Regions 3, 4, and 5 were the most severely affected, and declared disaster areas by the government of Guyana. Overnight, in the city and in coastal communities, thousands were forced to flee their homes. Some took shelter in multi-storey hotels, where rooms were all booked in a matter of hours and close to 5,000 people stayed in temporary shelters. The flood event saw the deployment of the British charity Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) Flood Rescue team with x6 boats and 30 volunteers led by Owen Medland of the RNLI. Under the UK Department of International Development the team were supported and accommodated by the Guyana Defence Forces. After January 19, there was lull in rainfall, which allowed a significant amount of water to drain off higher grounds but many areas were still flooded. Within days, floodwaters had overflowed canals, many of which were clogged with silt and garbage. Kokers were jammed and inoperable, resulting in floodwaters, which by this time had overwhelmed drinking and wastewater management systems, being unable to escape. Additionally, all manners of sewage, from septic tanks to pit latrines, were considered 100% flooded.[7] Agricultural Healthcare was limited as hospitals were also subject to the flooding.[8] Rains continued until the first week of February 2005, but floodwaters receded slowly and damage to low lying infrastructure, agriculture production and livelihood were beginning to show.[3] The heavy rain left two-thirds of Guyana's capital, Georgetown, flooded, affecting over 120,000 and killing six.[4] More than 40% of Guyana's population lost some or all of their possessions.[9] An outbreak of Leptospirosis added to the death toll. In addition to raw sewage, dead livestock and other animals contaminated the food waters. Warnings were issued to avoid playing in the water and avoid contact as much as possible.[10] The Ministry of Health, under advisement of PAHO/WHO, issued doxycycline as prophylactic treatment[7] to prevent further outbreak."

In Ireland, the worst affected areas were in the Shannon River Basin, in the west and Irish midlands.[12] Severe rain and some flooding was also reported in Northumberland, north Wales and Yorkshire.[13] Disruption from flooding, high winds, and damage to infrastructure led to the suspension of hundreds of rail services across the country, with the West Coast Main Line closed for several days due to flooding and a landslide. Sports fixtures were also cancelled and more than 43,000 homes across the north of England were left without power, as well as over 2,000 homes in the Republic of Ireland and around 700 in Wales. The extent of damage caused in such a short period across wide areas brought into focus the performance of UK central government flood defence strategies.[14] The expected heavy rainfall was considered to be an extreme weather event by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, who named it Synne.[15] The Free University of Berlin named the low Ted, as part of its Adopt\u2013a\u2013vortex programme.[16]"

Appleby, Keswick and Kendal in the English county of Cumbria suffered blocked roads, collapsed bridges and some homes were evacuated; Cumbria Police declared the situation a \"major incident\".[23]  Many houses in Carlisle were flooded, and tens of thousands of properties in Lancaster lost power when a sub-station was flooded.[24] About 5,200 homes were flooded in Lancashire and Cumbria[25] and approximately 1,000 people were evacuated from their homes in the town of Hawick in the Scottish Borders as a result of the River Teviot flooding. The River Nith burst its banks in Dumfries, flooding part of the town,[26] with a major emergency being declared in Dumfries & Galloway as a result.[27] Landslides and flooding closed some main roads in Scotland and Counties Down and Tyrone in Northern Ireland suffered road closures from fallen trees.[23] In the Republic of Ireland, the worst affected areas were the province of Connacht and counties Donegal, Westmeath, Tipperary, Limerick, Clare, Cork and Kerry. Multiple, particularly local, roads were closed as a result of rivers breaching their banks and excess rainfall. In Connacht, the damage was worst in Athleague, Ballinasloe, Carrick-on-Shannon, Claregalway, Crossmolina, Foxford and Galway city. Millions of euro worth of damage was caused in Bandon, Fermoy, Kenmare and Tralee, while the Blackpool area of Cork city was severely affected by a higher level of water flow in the River Lee. Heavy rain has also resulted in severe flooding in communities along the River Shannon, namely Athlone, Portumna, Shannon Harbour, Montpelier, Castleconnell, Clonlara, Parteen, Annacotty and Limerick city. The river breached its banks in Athlone on 9 December.[28] Other areas affected due to heavy rainfall included Bray, Clonmel and Ennis. In Glaslough, County Monaghan, the body of a 70-year-old man was found when his car was believed to have become trapped in a dipped part of a flooded road.[29] Further heavy rainfall exacerbated existing problems on the Isle of Man, which had been struck by localised flash flooding on 3 December,[30][31] with warnings that Desmond could bring more flooding and more damage to the island.[32] In Wales, heavy rainfall led to flooding close to Llandygai, near Bangor in Gwynedd, with RNLI coastguard helicopters rescuing one person from their car.[33] Flooding was also reported on Anglesey, in parts of Powys and in and around the South Wales city of Swansea.[33] Wind damage was reported in Llandudno as winds gusted to 83\u00a0mph within the Snowdonia National Park.

First, there is immediate help and assistance. Then second, there is a \u201creview\u201d. On occasions, this leads to a third stage of genuine reform, but in most cases \u201csticking plasters\u201d are applied. These are incremental and often sensible, but typically fail to address the core issues and hence provide only a temporary respite. There are very good reasons why \u201dsticking plasters\u201d will not work this time. The conventional approach to flood defence, carried out by the Environment Agency (EA), and financed largely by the Treasury, is at best inefficient. Sometimes it is even counterproductive, encouraging the sorts of land use and land management decisions that can actually make flooding worse in the medium term.\"[14] The Chairman of the UK's Environment Agency, the body responsible for main river maintenance resigned in early 2016. The UK government House of Commons Select Committee for the environment challenged the Chief Executive Officer of the Environment Agency on its performance by stating: \u201cYou [Sir James Bevan, CEO] said \"The capacity of a river doesn't matter!\" You've got to be certain the leopard has changed its spots. And I will keep repeating this. You haven't really given us an answer as to whether you have monitored the situation. I'm fearful. You allowed the River Parrett [Somerset] to silt up, you allowed the Tone to silt up, you allowed the tributaries to silt up, and then it flooded.\u201d The Committee added: \u201cThe EA don't provide [quotes for work] when doing projects so we can't compare like with like [with other project providers]. There is an argument for transparency on your spending... You say the right words and hold onto your power.\"[49]"

A British ship was also present, ostensibly to observe the actions of the other nations during the Samoan upheavals. Increasing signs of the impending disaster were visible during the days that were preceding the cyclone of March 15. March was the cyclone season in this area. Apia was hit by a cyclone just three years earlier. The local people told the captains of the ships about the cyclone. The weather was beginning to change, and the atmospheric pressure was beginning to fall. The captains were experienced Pacific seamen, as were many members of their crews. Everyone saw the approaching signs of impending disaster. Everyone knew that the only chance of riding out the 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) winds was to take to the open sea. Apia is an exposed harbour, unprotected by high ground or an enclosing reef. The northern part of the harbour is open to the Pacific. It is possible for the winds and the waves to sweep through the area, and to drive onto the reefs at the Southern end, or to toss up the beach any shipping which remained in the bay. No officers made a move, even though each officer of the various navies was well aware of the necessary procedures in the face of such a threat. This has been attributed to jingoism or national pride. No man in the harbour was willing to admit in front of the navies of other nations that he was afraid of the elements. Everyone refused to take precautions. [1] The merchant ships that accompanied them were not allowed to move either. Thirteen ships, and some larger vessels, were left at anchor close to one another in the Apia harbour."

USS\u00a0Vandalia was smashed into the same reef in the early afternoon, and her surviving crew spent a miserable day and night clinging to her rigging before being rescued, by which time 43 of her complement had drowned. USS\u00a0Nipsic was thrown high on the beach with eight of her crew missing or dead and her internal systems totally wrecked. She would however later be refloated and eventually reconstructed in Hawaii. The German ships fared much worse: SMS\u00a0Olga came off best, thrown high onto the beach where she was wrecked but many of her crew survived, escaping onto higher ground. SMS\u00a0Adler and SMS\u00a0Eber were less fortunate, because they were caught at the harbour mouth by the initial blow and were bodily picked up and smashed together. Eber sank in deep water, while Adler came to rest on her side, on the reef.[2] In total, 96 men from their crews drowned in the storm, and both ships were totally destroyed. All six of the merchant ships remaining in the harbour were wrecked, and the death toll was well over 200 sailors from several nationalities.[3] The incident is often cited as a clear example of the dangers of putting national pride before necessity, especially in the face of natural disaster.[4] The incident did not blunt the Pacific ambitions of any of the imperial powers involved in the disaster. However, the Germans and British continued to make territorial gains amongst the Samoan islands and New Guinea, whilst the United States focused on the Philippines and Micronesia, although more care was taken to respect the weather phenomena of the Pacific from this point on."

He achieved lasting fame as the captain of HMS\u00a0Beagle during Charles Darwin's famous voyage, FitzRoy's second expedition to Tierra del Fuego and the Southern Cone. FitzRoy was a pioneering meteorologist who made accurate daily weather predictions, which he called by a new name of his own invention: \"forecasts\".[2] In 1854 he established what would later be called the Met Office, and created systems to get weather information to sailors and fishermen for their safety.[2] He was an able surveyor and hydrographer. As Governor of New Zealand, serving from 1843 to 1845, he tried to protect the M\u0101ori from illegal land sales claimed by British settlers.[3]"

        "content": "Robert FitzRoy was born at Ampton Hall, Ampton, Suffolk, England, into the upper echelons of the British aristocracy and a tradition of public service. Through his father, General Lord Charles FitzRoy, Robert was a fourth great-grandson of Charles II of England; his paternal grandfather was Augustus Henry FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton. His mother, Lady Frances Stewart, was the daughter of the first Marquess of Londonderry and the half-sister of Viscount Castlereagh, who became Foreign Secretary. From the age of four, Robert FitzRoy lived with his family at Wakefield Lodge, their Palladian mansion in Northamptonshire. Robert's half-brother Sir Charles FitzRoy later served as Governor of New South Wales, Governor of Prince Edward Island and Governor of Antigua. In February 1818 at the age of 12, FitzRoy entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, and in the following year he entered the Royal Navy. At the age of 14, he embarked as a voluntary student aboard the frigate HMS\u00a0Owen Glendower, which sailed to South America in the middle of 1820, and returned in January 1822. He was promoted to midshipman while on the vessel, then served as such on HMS Hind. He completed his course with distinction and was promoted lieutenant on 7 September 1824, having passed the examination with 'full numbers' (100%), the first to achieve this result. After serving on HMS\u00a0Thetis, in 1828 he was appointed flag lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Waller Otway, commander-in-chief of the South American station, aboard HMS\u00a0Ganges. At that time Beagle, under Captain Pringle Stokes, was carrying out a hydrographic survey of Tierra del Fuego, under the overall command of Captain Phillip Parker King in HMS Adventure. Pringle Stokes became severely depressed and fatally shot himself. Under Lieutenant Skyring, the ship sailed to Rio de Janeiro, where Otway appointed FitzRoy as (temporary) captain of the Beagle on 15 December 1828. By the ship's return to England on 14 October 1830, FitzRoy had established his reputation as a surveyor and commander. During the survey, some of his men were camping onshore when a group of Fuegian natives made off with their boat. His ship gave chase and, after a scuffle, the culprits' families were brought on board as hostages. Eventually FitzRoy held two boys, a girl and two men (one man escaped.) As it was not possible to put them ashore conveniently, he decided to \"civilise the savages\", teaching them \"English ... the plainer truths of Christianity ... and the use of common tools\" before returning them as missionaries.[4] The sailors gave them names: the girl was called Fuegia Basket (so named because the replacement for the stolen boat was an improvised coracle that resembled a basket), the younger boy Jemmy Button (FitzRoy allegedly 'purchased' him with a large pearl button), the man York Minster (after the large rock so-named near which he was captured). The second, elder, boy he named Boat Memory. FitzRoy brought the four back with the ship to England. Boat Memory died following a smallpox vaccination. The others were cared for and taught by the trainee missionary Richard Matthews; they were considered civilised enough to be presented at Court to King William IV and Queen Adelaide in the summer of 1831."

        "content": "In early May 1831 FitzRoy stood as Tory candidate for Ipswich in the general election, but was defeated. His hopes of obtaining a new posting and organising a missionary project to Tierra del Fuego appeared to be failing. He was arranging for the charter of a ship at his own expense to return the Fuegians with Matthews when his friend Francis Beaufort, Hydrographer to the British Admiralty, and his \"kind uncle\", the Duke of Grafton, interceded on his behalf at the Admiralty. On 25 June 1831 FitzRoy was re-appointed commander of the Beagle. He spared no expense in fitting out the ship. He was conscious of the stressful loneliness of command. He knew of the suicides both of Captain Stokes and of his uncle Viscount Castlereagh, who had cut his own throat in 1822 while in government office. FitzRoy talked to Beaufort in August 1831, asking him to find a suitable gentleman companion for the voyage. Such a companion should share his scientific tastes, make good use of the expedition's opportunities for researching natural history, dine with him as an equal, and provide a semblance of normal human friendship.[5] While those Beaufort first approached (including Professor J. S. Henslow of the University of Cambridge) turned the opportunity down, FitzRoy eventually approved Charles Darwin for the position. Before they left England, FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, a book the captain had read that explained terrestrial features as the outcome of a gradual process taking place over extremely long periods. FitzRoy took a request from Lyell to record observations on geological features, such as erratic boulders.[6] FitzRoy and Darwin got on well together, but there were inevitable strains during the five-year survey voyage. The captain had a violent temper, his outbursts had gained him the nickname \"Hot Coffee\",[7] which resulted in quarrels sometimes \"bordering on insanity\", as Darwin later recalled. On a memorable occasion in March 1832 at Bahia, Brazil, Darwin was horrified at tales of the treatment of slaves. FitzRoy, while not endorsing brutality, recounted how an estancia owner once asked his slaves if they wished to be free and was told they did not. Darwin asked FitzRoy if he thought slaves could answer such a question honestly when it was posed by their master, at which the captain lost his temper and, before storming out, told Darwin that if he doubted his word they could no longer live together; effectively he banished Darwin from his table. Before nightfall FitzRoy's temper cooled and he sent an apology, with the request that Darwin \"continue to live with him.\" They avoided the subject of slavery from that time on. None of their quarrels were over religious or doctrinal issues; such disagreements came after the voyage.[5] At the island of \"Buttons Land\" in Tierra del Fuego they set up a mission post, but when they returned nine days later, the possessions had been looted. Matthews gave up, rejoining the ship. He left the three \"westernised\" Fuegians to continue the missionary work. While in the Falkland Islands, FitzRoy bought a schooner out of his own funds to assist with the surveying tasks he had been asked to complete. He had it refitted and renamed Adventure, hoping that the cost would be reimbursed by the Admiralty. They returned to the mission post but found only Jemmy Button. He had returned to native ways and refused the offer to go with them back to England. At Valparaiso in 1834, while Darwin was away from the ship exploring the Andes, the Admiralty reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the Adventure. He took the criticism badly, selling the schooner and announcing they would go back to recheck his survey, then resigning his command with doubts about his sanity. The ship's officers persuaded him to withdraw his resignation and continue as planned once Darwin returned to the ship.[7] FitzRoy continued his voyage, sailing on to the Galapagos, Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. He detoured to Bahia in Brazil on the return voyage so that he could carry out an additional check, to ensure the accuracy of his longitude measurements before returning to England."

        "content": "Soon after the Beagle's return on 2 October 1836, FitzRoy married Mary Henrietta O'Brien, a young woman to whom he had long been engaged. Darwin was amazed, as not once during the entire five years of the trip had FitzRoy spoken about being engaged. FitzRoy was awarded the Royal Premium by the Royal Geographical Society in 1837. Extracts from his diary read to the society on 8 May 1837 included the observation: FitzRoy wrote his account of the voyage, including editing the notes of the previous captain of the Beagle. It was published in May 1839 as the Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle, in four volumes, including Darwin's Journal and Remarks, 1832\u20131836 as the third volume. FitzRoy's account includes a section of Remarks with reference to the Deluge in which he admits that, having read works \"by geologists who contradict, by implication, if not in plain terms, the authenticity of the Scriptures\" and \"while led away by sceptical ideas,\" he had remarked to a friend that the vast plain of sedimentary material they were crossing \"could never have been effected by a forty days' flood.\" He wrote that in his \"turn of mind and ignorance of scripture,\" he was willing to disbelieve the Biblical account. Concerned that such ideas might \"reach the eyes of young sailors,\" he explains in detail his renewed commitment to a literal reading of the Bible, with arguments that rock layers high in the mountains containing sea shells are proof of Noah's Flood and that the six days of creation could not have extended over aeons because the grass, herbs and trees would have died out during the long nights.[9][10] R. D. Keynes, in his introduction to the 2001 edition of Darwin's diary, suggests that FitzRoy had undergone a religious conversion.[10] He was dissociating himself from the new ideas of Charles Lyell, which he had accepted during the voyage, and from Darwin's account which embraced these ideas. Under the influence of his very religious wife, he asserted a new commitment to the doctrine of the established Church of England.[7] In 1841 FitzRoy was elected as a Tory as one of the two Members of Parliament for Durham. He was appointed Acting Conservator of the River Mersey in 1842."

        "content": "The first Governor of New Zealand, Captain William Hobson, R.N., died in late 1842. The Church Missionary Society, which had a strong New Zealand presence, suggested FitzRoy as his successor and he was appointed by the government. He took up his new task in December 1843. On the journey to New Zealand, he met William John Warburton Hamilton and made him his private secretary.[11] His instructions were to maintain order and protect the M\u0101ori, while satisfying the land hunger of the settlers pouring into the country. He was given very few military resources. Government revenue, mainly from customs duties, was woefully inadequate for his responsibilities. One of his first tasks was to enquire into the circumstances surrounding the Wairau Affray, in which there had been violent conflict between settlers and the Maori. He found the actions of the colonists to have been illegal and declined to take any action against Te Rauparaha. He did not have the troops to meet him on anything like equal terms. But the New Zealand Company and the settlers felt betrayed and angry. He appointed a Government Superintendent for the area, to establish a ruling presence. Fitzroy also insisted that the New Zealand Company pay the M\u0101ori a realistic price for the land they claimed to have purchased. These moves made him very unpopular. Land sales were a continuing vexatious issue. The settlers were eager to buy land and some M\u0101ori were willing to sell, but under the provisions of the Treaty of Waitangi, land sales required the Government as an intermediary, and were thus extremely slow. FitzRoy changed the rules to allow settlers to purchase M\u0101ori land directly, subject to a duty of ten shillings per acre. But land sales proved slower than expected. To meet the financial shortfall, FitzRoy raised the customs duties, then replaced them with property and income taxes. All these expedients failed. Before long the Colony was faced with bankruptcy, and FitzRoy was forced to begin issuing promissory notes, paper money without backing. Meanwhile, the M\u0101ori in the far North, around the Bay of Islands, who had been the first to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, were feeling increasingly sidelined and resentful of the changes that had taken place in New Zealand. To signal their resentment, H\u014dne Heke cut down the flagpole at Koror\u0101reka. Rather than address the problems, FitzRoy had the flagpole re-erected. Hone Heke cut it down again, four times altogether; by the fourth occasion the First New Zealand War, sometimes called the Flagstaff War or the Northern War, was well under way. FitzRoy quickly realized that he did not have the resources to bring about a quick end to the war. Meanwhile, the spokesmen for the New Zealand Company were active back in the United Kingdom, lobbying against FitzRoy's Governorship, which they presented to the House of Commons in a very poor light. As a result, he was shortly afterwards recalled and replaced by George Grey, then Governor of South Australia. Grey was given the backing and financial support that FitzRoy had needed but was denied."

        "content": "FitzRoy returned to Britain in September 1848 and was made superintendent of the Royal Naval Dockyards at Woolwich. In March 1849 he was given his final sea command, the screw frigate HMS\u00a0Arrogant.[12] In 1850, FitzRoy retired from active service, partly due to ill health. The following year, in 1851, he was elected to the Royal Society with the support of 13 fellows, including Charles Darwin.[13] In 1854, on the recommendation of the President of the Royal Society, FitzRoy was appointed as chief of a new department to deal with the collection of weather data at sea. His title was Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade, and he had a staff of three. This was the forerunner of the modern Meteorological Office. He arranged for captains of ships to provide information, with tested instruments being loaned for this purpose, and for computation of the data collected.[14] FitzRoy soon began to work on strategies to make weather information more widely available for the safety of shipping and fishermen. He directed the design and distribution of a type of barometer which, on his recommendation, was fixed at every port to be available to crews for consultation before setting out to sea. Stone housings for such barometers are still visible at many fishing harbours.[15] The invention of several different types of barometers was attributed to him. These became popular and continued in production into the 20th century, characteristically engraved with Admiral FitzRoy's special remarks on interpretation, such as: \"When rising: In winter the rise of the barometer presages frost.\"[16] A storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the Royal Charter inspired FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made in which he coined the term \"weather forecast\".[14] Fifteen land stations were established to use the new telegraph to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times. The first daily weather forecasts were published in The Times in 1861.[2] The 1859 storm resulted in the Crown distributing storm glasses, then known as \"FitzRoy's storm barometers\", to many small fishing communities around the British Isles.[17] In 1860, FitzRoy introduced a system of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected. He ordered fleets to stay in port under these conditions.[18] The Weather Book, which he published in 1863, was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time.[19] Queen Victoria once sent messengers to FitzRoy's home requesting a weather forecast for a crossing she was about to make to the Isle of Wight.[2] Many fishing fleet owners objected to the posting of gale warnings, which required that fleets not leave the ports. Under this pressure, FitzRoy's system was abandoned for a short time after his death. The fishing fleet owners reckoned without the pressure of the fishermen, for whom FitzRoy had been a hero responsible for saving many lives. The system was eventually reinstated in simplified form in 1874.[18] When The Origin of Species was published FitzRoy was dismayed and apparently felt guilty for his part in the theory's development. He was in Oxford on 30 June 1860 to present a paper on storms and attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at which Samuel Wilberforce attacked Darwin's theory. During the debate FitzRoy, seen as \"a grey haired Roman nosed elderly gentleman\", stood in the centre of the audience and \"lifting an immense Bible first with both and afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man\". As he admitted that The Origin of Species had given him \"acutest pain\", the crowd shouted him down.[20] FitzRoy debunked Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby's lunar weather forecasting method as pseudoscience. Saxby tried to counter FitzRoy's arguments in the second edition of his book Saxby Weather System (1864).[21]"

When this came to light, in order to prevent Fitzroy's widow and daughter living in destitution, his friend and colleague Bartholomew Sulivan began an Admiral FitzRoy Testimonial Fund, which succeeded in getting the government to pay \u00a33,000 of this sum[27] (Charles Darwin contributed \u00a3100).[28] Queen Victoria gave the special favour of allowing his widow and daughter the use of grace and favour apartments at Hampton Court Palace.[29] FitzRoy is buried in the front churchyard of All Saints' Church in Upper Norwood, south London. His memorial was restored by the Meteorological Office in 1981. FitzRoy's publications arising from the Beagle expeditions were influential on Chilean exploration and settlement of Patagonia. His recommendation on establishing a British base on the Straits of Magellan to aid the travel between the British Isles and Australia contributed to the Chilean decision to occupy the straits in the 1840s.[30] FitzRoy's book Sailing Directions for South America led Chilean Navy hydrographer Francisco Hudson to investigate in the 1850s the possible existence of a sailing route through internal waters from the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago to the Straits of Magellan.[31] Enrique Simpson found instead FitzRoy's mapping of little use, noting in 1870 that \"Fitzroy's chart, that is quite exact until that point [Melinka 43\u00b0 53' S], is worthless further ahead...\". Thus south of Melinka, Simpson relied more in the late 18th-century sketches of Jos\u00e9 de Moraleda y Montero.[32] Simpson's contemporary Francisco Vidal Gormaz was critical of the overall work of FitzRoy and Darwin, stating that they had failed to acknowledge the importance of the Patagonian islands.[33]"

Another memorial, presented also in FitzRoy's bicentenary, commemorates his Cape Horn landing on 19 April 1830.[35] Mount Fitz Roy at the Argentina\u2013Chile border was named after him by the Argentine scientist and explorer Francisco Moreno.  It is 3,440\u00a0m (11,286\u00a0ft) high.  The aboriginals had not named it, and used the word chalt\u00e9n (meaning smoking mountain) for this and other peaks. Fitzroy River, in northern Western Australia, was named after him by Lieutenant John Lort Stokes who, at the time, commanded HMS Beagle (previously commanded by FitzRoy). The South American conifer Fitzroya cupressoides is named after him, as well as the Delphinus fitzroyi, a species of dolphin discovered by Darwin during his voyage aboard the Beagle.[38] Fitzroy, Falkland Islands and Port Fitzroy, New Zealand are also named after him.

The novel received the Sor Juana de la Cruz prize and was translated into English by Hardie St. Martin.[47] A novel entitled This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson was published in 2005 (it was published in the U.S. in 2006 under the title To the Edge of the World). The novel's plot followed the lives of FitzRoy, Darwin and others connected with the Beagle expeditions, following them between the years of 1828 and 1865. It was a nominee on the long list for the 2005 Man Booker Prize[48] (although Thompson died in November 2005). The novel Darwin's Dreams by Sean Hoade was published in 2008 and republished in a new edition in 2016. The novel begins with the first meeting of Darwin and FitzRoy and ends with Darwin receiving notice of FitzRoy's suicide. The plot is interlaced with fictional \"dreams\" that imagine how the world would be if the ideas of evolutionary thinkers over the millennia had been literally true. The dreams also show how Darwin's subconscious dealt with major themes in his life such as the death of his beloved daughter Annie and his lifelong friendship and rivalry with FitzRoy.[49] The play Darwins Kapten was published by Henning Mankell in 2009, and had its world premiere in 2010 at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. It is about Darwin and his journey on the Beagle: many years after the five-year long voyage, Darwin receives a message that his captain on the ship, FitzRoy, has died by suicide. The play portrays the reception of Darwin's discoveries, as well as the consequences of taking a stand against existing ideas in a world that is built on belief in God as the only creator of life.[50]"

        "content": " Hurricane Walaka was a Category\u00a05 hurricane that brought high surf and a powerful storm surge to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Walaka was the nineteenth named storm, twelfth hurricane, eighth major hurricane, and second Category\u00a05 hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season.[2] The tropical cyclone originated from an area of low pressure that formed around 1,600\u00a0mi (2,600\u00a0km) south-southeast of Hawaii on September\u00a024. The system tracked westward and moved into the Central Pacific Basin about a day later. The disturbance continued westward over the next few days, organizing into a tropical depression on September\u00a029. Later that day, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, receiving the name Walaka. The storm then rapidly intensified, becoming a hurricane on September\u00a030 and a major hurricane by October\u00a01. The cyclone took on a more northward track under the influence of a low-pressure system located to the north. Walaka peaked as a Category 5 hurricane, with winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 921\u00a0mbar (27.20\u00a0inHg), early on October\u00a02. An eyewall replacement cycle caused the hurricane to weaken, though it remained a major hurricane for the next couple of days. Afterward, less favorable conditions caused a steady weakening of the hurricane, and Walaka became extratropical on October\u00a06, well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands. The storm's remnants accelerated northeastward, before dissipating on October\u00a07. Although the hurricane did not hit any major landmasses, it passed very close to the unpopulated Johnston Atoll as a strong Category\u00a04 hurricane, where a hurricane warning was issued in advance of the storm. Four scientists there intended to ride out the storm on the island, but were evacuated before the storm hit. Walaka neared the far Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, but weakened considerably as it did so. East Island in the French Frigate Shoals suffered a direct hit and was completely destroyed. The storm caused significant damage to the nesting grounds for multiple endangered species; coral reefs in the region suffered considerable damage, displacing the local fish population. Several dozen people had to be rescued off the southern shore of Oahu as the storm brought high surf to the main Hawaiian Islands."

        "content": "On September\u00a022, 2018, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that a low-pressure area would form around 130\u2013140\u00b0 west.[3] Two days later, a trough\u00a0\u2013 an elongated region of low atmospheric pressure\u00a0\u2013  formed around 1,600\u00a0mi (2,600\u00a0km) south-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii.[4] The disturbance entered the Central Pacific Basin on September\u00a026 as a mixture of low-level clouds and larger cumulus clouds. A subtropical ridge located north of the Hawaiian Islands caused the system to track westward over the next few days. A surface low formed by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a027 as the system was located 805\u00a0mi (1,296\u00a0km) southeast of Hilo. The system became Tropical Depression One-C around 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029 while it was around 690\u00a0mi (1,110\u00a0km) south of Honolulu, Hawaii.[1] Convection or thunderstorm activity formed near the system's low-level circulation center, and a banding feature\u00a0\u2013 significantly elongated, curved bands of rain clouds\u00a0\u2013  became established over the southern and eastern portions of the depression. Six hours later, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, receiving the name Walaka from the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC).[1][5] The nascent tropical storm was located in an environment of warm 84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C) sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear, and humid air.[1][5] After forming, the cyclone's banding features degraded, although its convection persisted. Meanwhile, the ridge continued to steer Walaka westward.[6] Around this time, Walaka began a stint of rapid intensification.[1] Convection became more abundant around the storm's low-level center during the morning of September\u00a030.[7] Walaka's cloud tops cooled;[8] the tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[1]  A cloud-filled eye emerged on visible satellite imagery by early October 1 as Walaka continued to strengthen.[9] Walaka became a Category\u00a03 major hurricane around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01, the fourth storm to do so in the Central Pacific in 2018.[1] At that time, the hurricane possessed a prominent eye surrounded by a sizeable ring of cold clouds. Walaka turned towards the west-northwest as it moved around the southwestern edge of the ridge.[10] Walaka peaked as a Category\u00a05 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 921\u00a0mbar (27.20\u00a0inHg), at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02. Walaka's peak intensity made it the second Category 5 hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season.[1] Around that time, the cyclone had a clear, 23-mile (37\u00a0km) wide eye surrounded by cool cloud tops.[11] Meanwhile, microwave imagery and ASCAT data showed the formation of concentric eyewalls, signaling that an eyewall replacement cycle had commenced. A strengthening upper-level low located north of Walaka was causing the hurricane to begin a more northward track.[1][12][13] Walaka maintained its peak intensity for six hours before beginning to decay as a result of the eyewall replacement cycle. The cyclone continued to track northward under the influence of the upper-level low.[1][13] The hurricane weakened to a minimal Category\u00a04 hurricane by 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a03. By that time, Walaka's eye had degraded on satellite imagery;[1] the eye had become cloud-filled, and the clouds making up the eyewall and central dense overcast had warmed.[14][15] Walaka passed about 45\u00a0mi (72\u00a0km) west of Johnston Island around 03:00\u00a0UTC.[16] After completing the eyewall cycle, Walaka reintensified slightly, reaching a secondary peak of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a03.[1] The cyclone's eye became increasingly delineated as the clouds comprising the eyewall cooled. Although the storm had restrengthened, increasing wind shear was thinning the northwestern eyewall.[17] Soon after, Walaka began to weaken once more as it advanced north-northeastward. Later on October\u00a03, the western and southwestern eyewall eroded as a result of the wind shear. At the same time, upper-level cirrus outflow was disrupted in the southwestern and northeastern portions of the storm.[18] The already strong wind shear increased even further, peaking at 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) around 00:00\u00a0UTC. Walaka's eye disappeared from visible satellite imagery and the southwestern portion of the low-level center became uncovered.[19] Walaka moved across the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument near Brooks Banks, a submerged volcanic cone, around 06:20\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04. At that time, the Category\u00a03 hurricane was located approximately 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) west-northwest of the French Frigate Shoals.[1] Environmental conditions deteriorated even further on October\u00a04 as sea surface temperatures fell below 81\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C) and ocean heat content decreased.[20] This caused Walaka to rapidly weaken; the hurricane fell below major hurricane intensity around 12:00\u00a0UTC and was a minimal Category\u00a01 hurricane by 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05.[1] Early on October 5, Walaka turned towards the northwest as it traced the northern boundary of the upper-level low. Convection associated with the storm continued to dissipate; the remaining thunderstorm activity was displaced northeast of the storm's low-level center.[21] The wind shear abated later on October 5, although sea surface temperatures along the remainder of the tropical storm's track were cooler than 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C). As a result of the decreased shear, Walaka's low-level center was temporarily recovered by convection and the weakening trend slowed as the storm continued north-northwest.[1][22] By late October\u00a05, the low-level center was completely exposed once more and the remaining convection had all but dissipated. Walaka turned towards the northeast, steered by an upper-level trough.[1][23] Walaka transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06 after having been deprived of thunderstorm activity.[1][24] The extratropical cyclone tracked over the open sea and dissipated by 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a07.[1] Unrelated to Walaka, Typhoon Kong-rey was a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon and Walaka had Category 5 hurricane intensity at the same time, marking the first time since 2005 when two tropical cyclones of Category 5 strength existed simultaneously in the Northern Hemisphere.[25]"

Early on October\u00a02, a hurricane watch was issued for Nihoa to French Frigate Shoals to Maro Reef. Later in the day, a hurricane warning was issued for French Frigate Shoals to Maro Reef and a tropical storm warning was issued for Nihoa to French Frigate Shoals.[1] A crew of four scientists on the isolated Johnston Atoll had planned on riding out the storm in an evacuation shelter until the United States Fish and Wildlife Service sought an emergency evacuation on October\u00a01. The United States Coast Guard flew a plane from Kalaeloa Airport to evacuate the personnel the next day.[26][27] Seven researchers studying Hawaiian monk seals and green sea turtles on French Frigate Shoals were evacuated to Honolulu on October\u00a02.[28] Walaka struck the northwestern Hawaiian Islands as a Category\u00a03 hurricane on October\u00a04.[1] A powerful storm surge accompanied the hurricane as it traversed the French Frigate Shoals. The small, low-lying East Island suffered a direct hit and was completely destroyed, sediment being scattered across coral reefs to the north. The island had served as one of the major nesting locations for the endangered green sea turtles, and critically endangered Hawaiian monk seals.[29] An estimated 19\u00a0percent of 2018's sea turtle nests on the island were lost, but all adult females tending the nests left before the storm. Approximately half of Hawaii's green sea turtles nested on the island, and Charles Littnan\u00a0\u2013 director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's protected species division\u00a0\u2013 stated it would take years for the implications of the island's loss to be fully understood.[30] By August 2019, satellite imagery showed that sand was beginning to reaccumulate on East Island.[31] Coral reefs near the French Frigate Shoals, Lisianski Island, and the Pearl and Hermes Atoll were substantially damaged, displacing the native fish population.[1] Swells from Hurricane Walaka brought high surf to the main Hawaiian Islands on October\u00a04. Walaka produced a surf that was 6\u201312\u00a0ft (1.8\u20133.7\u00a0m) high along the southern and western shores of Niihau, Kauai, and Oahu. The southern shores of Molokai, Lanai, and Maui experienced waves approximately 5\u20138\u00a0ft (1.5\u20132.4\u00a0m) in height. Hawaii's Big Island endured a surf that was 6\u201310\u00a0ft (1.8\u20133.0\u00a0m) high on its western shores.[32] At least 81\u00a0people had to be rescued by lifeguards off the southern shore of Oahu.[33]"

This system would eventually strengthen into BOB 05. A meteorological station at the time recorded the maximum quantity of rain for the day, 23 centimetres (230\u00a0mm; 9.1 in). Rainfall totaled 21 centimetres (210\u00a0mm; 8.3 in) at both Nungambakkam and Ambattur.[18] On 8 November, the former would reach its maximum total amount of 21.5 centimetres (215\u00a0mm; 8.5 in).Due to the floods, which were extended from 8\u20139 November, the state issued a school holiday. By 7 November, three people had died as a result of the disaster, and two more had gone missing. Flooding also caused traffic disruptions over Chennai, and flood warnings were issued for Vellore as the Mordhana river overflowed. Due to the continuing rains, a major reservoir in the state was also expected to reach its maximum capacity. On that day, 650 families in a residential area were also rescued. Meanwhile, relief and cleanup efforts for the state's displaced citizens have begun.[19] By 9 November, five people had died. Residents in north Chennai had to deal with knee-deep flooding, and some had already resorted to swimming pools and other available options to avoid getting wet. Central Chennai was the hardest hit in the city, as two canals and one river overflowed in the area, causing major flooding. Many people there lost their homes, and snakes were said to have been present in their homes. Flood warnings were in effect in the impacted areas, as residents expressed concern about cows wading through floodwaters throughout the storm. In addition, due to the continuing rain, Chennai has been placed on red alert. Reservoirs continued to pour water, and the Tamil Nadu Revenue and Disaster Management Minister announced that 538 huts and four houses had been damaged. School activities have also been canceled by the state administration until 9 November.[20][2] Due to the ongoing rain, seven more people have been added to the death toll, bringing the total to 12 on 10 November. In the Tiruchirappalli district, almost 200 acres (81\u00a0ha) 200 acres (81 hectares) of rice fields were damaged and swamped by floodwaters, while road closures and traffic detours remained in Chennai. In addition to the metropolis, the IMD has issued a red alert for Viluppuram and Cuddalore, as heavy rain is expected to persist. A toddler was killed by a wall collapse in Thanjavur district, while an elderly woman perished from electrocution in Tiruchirapalli. As a result, the state's death toll has risen to 14. Flights across Chennai were also suspended or diverted to other airports.[21] On 11 November, the human death toll from the event remained at 16, with 157 cattle fatalities. The state police also rescued and considered dead an unconscious guy; nevertheless, he survived when he was taken to the hospital. In Chennai, around 444 residential areas were also flooded. Flood warnings were issued for the affected areas, particularly for those who live near the Arani River. BOB 05 dumped the most rain in the state, with 23 centimetres (230\u00a0mm; 9.1 in) falling in Tambaram and Chengalpattu on that day. The National Disaster Response Force teams also came in the former and Cuddalore to stabilize and aid the area's administrations for probable assistance, while southern Chennai lost power due to heavy rains on that day. As a precaution, railway services were suspended, and operations at the Madras High Court were restricted to skeletal forces. Reservoirs across the state are also seeing an uptick in water levels. In Tamil Nadu, relief operations were also deployed, and the state government formed a committee to examine the amount of crop damage as a result of the rains.[22][23] Areas in the state capital, Chennai, were waterlogged and government officials had to use pumps to drain communities who were stranded in waist-deep waters.[2] The storm brought the highest single day rainfall total since 2015, when it received over 49.4 centimeters (494\u00a0mm; 19.4 in) on 1 December. On 11 November 2021, Chennai received 21 centimeters (210\u00a0mm; 8.2 in) of rain.[15]"

Between December 2016 and January 2017, Southern Thailand experienced a devastating flood disaster. The bulk of the 15 provinces in Southern Thailand were affected, and this flood event stood out from earlier flood catastrophes due to the massive, long-term damage it produced. Since around December 31, 2016, there have been abnormally significant rains for that time of year. According to the Meteorological Department, thunderstorms and strong winds continued to affect the southern regions. The amount of water in the Nan River, which flows through the Taphan Hin and Bang Mun Nak districts of the capital city of Phichit Province, rose at an alarming rate.[1] This is the second deadly flood in a month in southern Thailand. The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM) of the Ministry of Interior estimates that there were 95 fatalities and 1,815,618 total victims in the 13 prefectures that were affected by the disaster. 4,314 road segments, 348 bridges, 126 weirs, and 2 sluices were among the destroyed infrastructure items.[2] The extensive area of heavy rain and the simultaneous occurrence of numerous dam breaks severely damaged the local logistics infrastructure. While gum and palm oil help some regions' economies, others, like the extremely underdeveloped territory bordering Malaysia, are socioeconomically unstable. In these situations, the government made efforts in disaster restoration works by utilizing the military in a way that had never before been done for this purpose. Some 120 billion baht (US$4 billion) in damages are foreseen as of mid-January, much of this due to lost production in agriculture tourism and infrastructure.[3] Rubber supply is particularly impacted. Particularly hard hit are palm and rubber plantations.[4]"

Cattle feed is in short supply due to agricultural devastation caused by floodwaters. Rescue teams were dispatched to the area. In order to force flood water into the sea, the navy has assisted the boats.[11] In January 2017, several days of torrential downpour inundated most of southern Thailand. Although floods brought on by the monsoon are frequent in the area, the rainy season typically ends around November. On January 9, 2017, an image of a flooded area close to the Pra River was taken by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the Landsat 8 satellite. Flood water with silt makes up a large portion of the tan and yellow color of the terrain. The same region is depicted in the second shot on February 2, 2014, when the seas were lower.

Major rubber plantations in southern Thailand provide a large portion of the nation's rubber supply. As a result of the floods, the estimated production for 2016\u20132017 was 10% lower. The continuous floods and persistent rain ruined close to 1 million rai of cropland. Over 990,000 rai were planting crops, 39,000 rai for animal farms, and 19,000 rai for grassland. According to Uthai Sonlucksub, president of the Natural Rubber Council of Thailand, southern Thailand is a significant rubber-producing region, and the floods hit this area at a difficult moment for farmers by disrupting infrastructure. He further added that since the demand exceeded supply, the price of rubber would inflate the following year.[15] Both agricultural and non-agricultural industries saw decreased employment because of the economic recession, which diminished domestic consumption. However, the number of Chinese and Russian visitors increased. The University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC) anticipated that the region's 3.2% economic growth would reduce by 1.2 percentage points. The damage is forecasted to lower the southern region's GDP growth from an earlier forecast 3.2% increase to merely 2% growth. 8.6% of the country's GDP is attributable to the south. The regional GDP predicts to have increased by 2.9% from the previous year to 1.13 trillion baht last year. A Department of Business Development study indicates that, in varying degrees, 43,000 enterprises have taken the brunt. Retail and agricultural companies are among the ones impacted. The impact of the flooding on the nation's GDP as a whole, according to Mr. Vachira, was anticipated to be minimal\u2014only 0.1%, to be exact.[16]"

Over 3 million rai of agricultural land, 14,097 fish ponds, 2,055 roads, and 4,129 dwellings were all affected. Meanwhile, the northern province of Tak, with at least 29 buildings in Ban Rom Klao Sahamit in tambon Khiri Rat of the Phrop Phra district, recorded severe flash floods due to heavy rainfall. The village's main road was covered in a deep layer of mud from the flooding, making it impassable. Several bridges on the country's primary north-south route were washed away in one instance of flash floods, causing a 200-kilometer traffic backup (125 miles). Numerous rivers, like the Ta Pi River, have inundated adjacent settlements and their barricades, forcing people to flee to higher land. From the overall damage, it's projected that infrastructure, including roads, railroads, bridges, and dwellings, will suffer damage worth 3.40 billion baht; agricultural, 8.1 billion baht; and companies and industry, primarily small and medium-sized organizations, 10.9 billion baht.[17]"

The Andaman Coast has also witnessed rain and large waves, with Krabi and Trang among the regions suffering the brunt of the monsoon rains. The Gulf Coast of Thailand has suffered the worst weather. Additionally, flooding has damaged cultural heritage sites and restricted access to tourist locations. In several southern provinces, transportation has been affected by the flood waters, with the road, rail, and aviation services all suffering.[20] The airport in Nakhon Si Thammarat has been temporarily closed because of flooding. Due to floods on the railway in Prachuap Khiri Khan this week, train services between Bangkok and the south have been delayed, resulting in trains to the south stopping at Hua Hin (one of the top tourist destinations). Until the situation improved, ferry, speedboat, and longtail boat services between the islands along the Gulf Coast were also discontinued.[21] Despite the nation's high unemployment rate brought on by severe floods and tropical storms, the number of international visitors increased significantly. Chinese visitors, in particular, climbed dramatically, helped by temporary initiatives to reduce and waive visa fees and this year's Chinese New Year fell in January (last year was in February). The number of tourists from Europe and Russia has also been steadily increasing. Increased domestic and international flights were evidence of this."

The most affected roads were the Qumza Highway in Mdantsane, Woolwash Road near the Scenery Park bridge and the Douglas Smith Highway in Duncan Village.Some bridges, in particular the Zone 15 road bridge, were damaged and required assessments.[15] The flooding also had a negative impact on local water infrastructure, with raw water from Bridle Drift Dam to the Umzonyana water treatment plant negatively affected by flash floods, resulting in limited water use for residents.[18] As of February 1, the water quality had improved and returned within safe drinking standards. But the amount of water that is safe to drink remains an issue that needs to be further addressed.[19] Finally, floods are considered by scholars to have the worst impact on the poor[20] and pose a serious threat to the insurance industry while causing huge economic losses.[21]"

Infrastructure was severely damaged, including 49 health facilities and 57 schools.[23] Bridges were destroyed, access to pipelines was blocked, rivers washed away their banks and some main roads were flooded, making access to stranded communities even more difficult.[5] Environmental health services and infrastructure were damaged or disrupted, and the risk of waterborne and food-borne infections increased. Overcrowding and population displacement are ideal environments for outbreaks of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Residents who suffer from chronic illnesses may not have received the care they needed or taken their medication on time.[24] As the floodwaters receded, disease-carrying insects proliferated. Scientists have predicted the imminent emergence of highly contagious animal diseases.[25]"

Forming as tropical depression on January\u00a025, Arthur rapidly intensified into a strong Category 2 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Nadi, Fiji. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the storm to have peaked as a minimal category 1 cyclone. Shortly after peaking in intensity, the cyclone began to weaken due to unfavorable conditions. Quickly moving towards the east-southeast, the Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition. After turning towards the southeast, the center of circulation was almost fully exposed due to strong wind shear. However, Arthur briefly re-strengthened late on January\u00a026 before becoming extratropical the next day. Tropical Cyclone Arthur affected several small islands during its existence. French Polynesia observed the most noteworthy effects from the storm, where several landslides damaged a few homes."

The system developed a large banding feature in the northern portion of the circulation and deep convection formed around the center of circulation. The depression had moved into an area of weak to moderate wind shear with favorable diffulence aloft.[3] Later that day, gale warnings were issued for the northeastern quadrant of the system.[1] Tropical Depression 08F continued to develop as an anticyclone developed above the system, enhancing the environment around it. A mid-latitude trough located north of the depression was steering it towards the east.[4] Early on January 24, the system became better organized and strengthened into a cyclone at 0600\u00a0UTC.[1] The storm, which was named Arthur by the FMS, began to undergo rapid intensification as the structure improved significantly. Deep convection developed around the center with strong outflow towards the north. Several hours after becoming a cyclone, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Cyclone 09P as it traveled quickly towards the east-southeast. The quick movement was due to the influences of subtropical ridge to the north and a trough to the south.[5] Later that day, a banding eye feature began to develop as the storm intensified into a Category 2 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale.[6] At 1800\u00a0UTC, the JTWC assessed Arthur to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) 1-minute winds), the equivalent of a minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[7] Early on January\u00a025, Arthur reached its peak intensity with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 975\u00a0hPa (mbar) while located about 635\u00a0km (395\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Rarotonga.[1] Shortly after peaking in intensity, Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition and rapidly deteriorated[8] due to strong wind shear.[1] The storm also began to merge with a low-level frontal boundary associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Zita.[8] The strong shear left the center of circulation partially exposed, with deep convection persisting in only the southeastern quadrant.[9] In addition to the shear, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken further.[10] While continuing to move at a quick pace, the storm began to turn towards the southeast along a baroclinic zone. Early on January\u00a026, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the cyclone as it lost most of its tropical characteristics.[11] Arthur re-intensified shortly after[12] and the JTWC reissued advisories on the storm around 2100\u00a0UTC. The brief re-strengthening was the result of a breakdown in the baroclinic zone which allowed convection to redevelop around the center.[13] Around the same time, Arthur left the FMS's area of responsibility (AoR) and entered the New Zealand's MetService's AoR. The storm completed its extratropical transition around 1200\u00a0UTC on January\u00a027, leading to the final advisory being issued on the storm.[1]"

The disturbance was deemed to have a very high chance of becoming a tropical cyclone while posing a threat to populated areas and was designated a \"Potential Tropical Cyclone\". The storm caused flooding and brought tropical storm-force winds to parts of the Southeastern United States and the Mid-Atlantic states, particularly Florida and the Carolinas, before going on to affect parts of Atlantic Canada. Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten was the tenth storm that had advisories issued on it by the NHC in 2017, and the only such system that failed to fully develop into a tropical cyclone during that Atlantic hurricane season. Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of West Africa on August 13. The disturbance slowly tracked its way westward across the Atlantic Ocean, before reaching Florida in late August. The disturbance came close to developing into a tropical storm while it was situated off the coast of the Carolinas; however, strong wind shear and outflow from Hurricane Harvey prevented the storm from organizing into a tropical cyclone. The system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone instead, and became a strong hurricane-force low to the south of Newfoundland, before being absorbed by another extratropical system near Iceland on September 3. The storm caused flooding across Florida, especially around Fort Myers and other areas in southwestern Florida, forcing the evacuation of more than 200 people. The disturbance dropped a maximum total of rainfall in excess of 30 inches (76\u00a0cm) of rain in Ten Mile Canal and Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve, in southwestern Florida, in addition to 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) of rain in the western parts of Fort Myers.[1] The flooding was the worst seen in western Florida in at least 20 years.[2] Overall, the storm killed two people and caused more than $1.923 million (2017 USD) in damages.[3] Less than two weeks after the storm, Hurricane Irma made landfall in southwestern Florida, which further compounded the damage in the region.[4][5]"

Such systems are termed \"Potential Tropical Cyclones\". Advisories on these storms contain the same content as typical tropical cyclone advisories, including track forecasts, and cyclone watches and warnings, similar to advisories that the NHC issues on active tropical cyclones.[6][7] This was first demonstrated on June\u00a018 with the designation of Potential Tropical Cyclone Two, which later developed into Tropical Storm Bret, east-southeast of the Windward Islands.[8] In addition, the numbering that a potential tropical cyclone receives would be retained for the rest of the hurricane season, meaning that the next tropical system or disturbance would be designated with the following number, even though potential tropical cyclones are not treated as tropical cyclones. This was first demonstrated with Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten, which failed to develop into a tropical cyclone.[9] After that storm's formation and dissipation, one of the following tropical systems, which would eventually become Hurricane Katia, was designated as \"Tropical Depression Thirteen\", even though the Atlantic hurricane season had a total of only 12 tropical cyclones at that point.[10][11] Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten was the first system so designated not to become an organize as a tropical cyclone.[12]"

        "content": "At the beginning of August\u00a013, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave on the western coast of Africa, which quickly emerged into the eastern Atlantic. Amid favorable environmental conditions, the wave was expected to merge with a broad area of low pressure southwest of Cape Verde and gradually organize thereafter.[13][14] Instead, the two disturbances remained separate, with the broad trough to the west continuing westward and the tropical wave moving farther north.[15] The system farther to the west accelerated further[16] and eventually developed into Tropical Storm Harvey on August 17 (which later became a hurricane), while the tropical wave to the east lagged behind.[17] On August 18, the disturbance behind Harvey became increasingly organized and was given a 70% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 2 days; however, increased wind shear weakened the system and prevented it from attaining full tropical characteristics.[18][19] The disturbance remained disorganized while moving northwestward over the next several days, reaching the Bahamas on August 21.[20] The disturbance crossed south Florida on August 23, and stalled to the west of the peninsula for the next two days.[21][22] On August 25, the storm moved over central Florida and stalled there for two days, before emerging off the east coast of Florida on August 27.[23] Late on August 27, the system organized significantly off the coast of Georgia; as the system was expected to develop into a tropical cyclone within 2 days and posed a hazard to the Southeastern United States, the NHC designated the storm as Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten and initiated advisories on the storm.[24] At the time of its designation on August 27, Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten was given a 90% chance of becoming a tropical storm within the next 2 days.[24] Due to the storm's organization and its proximity to land, Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings were issued for the coasts of North and South Carolina.[25] However, the storm remained disorganized and lacked a closed low-level circulation.[9] On August 28, Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten's central pressure reached 1,006 millibars (29.7\u00a0inHg), and the storm had 1-minute sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h),[nb 1] equivalent to that of a minimal tropical storm. However, the system still lacked a closed low-level circulation center, and increasing wind shear from the southeast and outflow from Hurricane Harvey (which was now a tropical storm) was beginning to inhibit the system's chances of tropical development.[26][27] As the system accelerated to the northeast, the storm expanded in size, though it grew increasingly disorganized.[28][29] As the storm moved past the Carolinas, on August 29, the disturbance brought thunderstorms to the region, in addition to tropical storm-force winds.[29] The NHC noted that the disturbance had \"very cold, but extremely deep asymmetric convection\", with all of the thunderstorms around the center displaced to the east, due to strong wind shear.[29] Around that time, the disturbance began interacting with a baroclinic zone, causing the disturbance to begin transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Late on August 29, at 18:00 UTC, Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone, even as it finished developing a closed low-level circulation, while situated off the coast of North Carolina; as such, the NHC issued their final advisory on the storm and cancelled the tropical storm warnings in the area.[30][31][29] The storm strengthened as it became extratropical, with the disturbance's minimum central pressure reaching 1,004 millibars (29.6\u00a0inHg) and the storm's sustained winds reaching 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h), just as it completed its transition.[9] During the next couple of days, Ten's extratropical remnant quickly intensified, while accelerating to the northeast. On August 31, at 12:00 UTC, Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten's remnant reached a peak intensity of 971 millibars (28.7\u00a0inHg) to the south of Newfoundland, with hurricane-force sustained winds at 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[32][33][31] Afterward, Ten's extratropical remnant weakened, and the system began to be drawn into another extratropical storm near Iceland, on September 3.[34][35] Later on the same day, Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten's remnant was fully absorbed by the larger extratropical cyclone, southwest of Iceland.[36] This extratropical system was named Windstorm Perryman by the Free University of Berlin on September 4; Windstorm Perryman subsequently impacted Ireland and the United Kingdom.[37]"

The western portions of Fort Myers reported 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) of rainfall, which was equivalent to about 55% of the city's annual rainfall total.[1] On Monday, August 28, water levels peaked at a depth of 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) on Island Park Road, on US Route 41. Flooding from the storm forced the rescue of more than 200 people and 37 animals, all of whom were evacuated.[38][1] There was only one road leading into and out of more than a dozen gated communities along Island Park Road, which made it difficult for people to evacuate from the floods. Numerous homes were damaged by the floodwaters, including those in an RV park near the highway.[2] Schools were closed across Lee and Collier Counties, and numerous roads were closed.[1] Many roads were covered by more than 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) of water, and several cars were stalled on Island Park Road.[2] In Lee County, around the Fort Boca Grande area, over 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) of rain fell across the area from August 26 to 27, with Cape Coral recording 12.09 inches (30.7\u00a0cm) of rain over a 72-hour period; this led to extreme flooding from August 27 to 28. Floodwaters entered 11 homes in Captiva and breached some trailer homes in the Coastal Estate Trailer Parks; another 30 trailers in the Tropical Trailer Park experienced waist-deep floodwaters.[39] Numerous roads around Captiva, Cape Coral, Sanibel, and Pine Island were covered by floodwaters 1\u20133 feet (0.30\u20130.91\u00a0m) deep, requiring 7 car rescues from first responders. The floods resulted in $300,000 (2017 USD) in property damage in the Fort Boca Grande area.[39] In Manatee County, up to 17 inches (43\u00a0cm) of rain fell from August 26 to 28, causing numerous instances of street flooding, floating cars on State Road 70, and forcing the rescue of one person. In the Longbeach area, floodwaters entered numerous homes and businesses, with 67 homes experiencing over a foot (0.3 meters) of water, mostly in the Centre Lake Community, forcing the families living there to evacuate; water also entered homes along Manatee Avenue West around 38th Street West.[40] On the evening of August 27, a 61-year-old man drowned in the Sara Palms neighborhood of the Longbeach area, when his wheelchair tipped over into the floodwaters. The flooding in Manatee County caused $1.34 million (2017 USD) in property damage.[40] In Fort Myers Beach, in Lee County, heavy rainfall from August 27 to 28 resulting in localized flooding, with floodwaters breaching mobile homes in Estero and Bonita Springs. The floods forced the evacuation of 70 people from a mobile home park in Estero, and another 116 people were forced to evacuate from a mobile home park in Bonita Springs, due to rising floodwaters from the Imperial River. The floods in Fort Myers Beach caused $100,000 (2017 USD) in property damage.[41] In the neighboring Sarasota County, a maximum total of 16 inches (41\u00a0cm) of rain fell across the area from August 26 to 28, which caused numerous instances of street flooding, and resulted in $50,000 (2017 USD) in property damage.[42] On the afternoon of August 27, a 73-year-old man in Longboat Key drowned when his car was carried away by floodwaters into a drainage ditch, after he tried driving through a flooded parking lot at a dog park.[42] The disturbance was also responsible for severe weather in Florida. From August 23 to 28, at least 21 storm reports were filed, including multiple instances of wind damage from severe thunderstorms.[3] On August 24, at 10:05\u00a0a.m. EDT, a funnel cloud was reported in Hilolo, in Okeechobee County. A trained weather spotter reported observing the funnel cloud near Fort Drum, while he was driving northward on U.S. Route 441.[43] On August 26, at 8:19\u00a0p.m. EDT, an EF0 tornado touched down in Samoset, in Manatee County, before lifting three minutes later, at 8:22\u00a0p.m. EDT. A couple of witnesses reported seeing a funnel cloud in the area around the time when the tornado touched down.[44] The tornado left a narrow path of damage and caused minor damage at a County Public Works Facility, in addition to throwing around aluminum debris and downing multiple trees. The tornado caused $20,000 (2017 USD) in damage.[44] Overall, the storm killed two people in Florida and caused more than $1.923 million (2017 USD) in damages.[3] Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Irma made landfall in southwestern Florida, which further compounded the damage in the region.[4][5]"

It affected over 30,000 square kilometers of land and exposed about 6.6 million people to potential risks. The flood was caused by heavy rainfall and increased water flows from the Cameroonian highlands.[1] It resulted in 25 deaths, 58 injuries, and the displacement of 131,638 people. It also submerged 153 communities and damaged houses, farmlands and other properties. The flood highlighted the vulnerability of the region to such events and the need for better preparedness and mitigation measures.[2][3] In October 2023, the North-East region of Nigeria experienced a series of flood incidents, primarily attributed to water releases from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), this event resulted in significant infrastructure damage, displacing more than 8,504 households and killing 33 individuals, predominantly women, children, and the elderly.[4]"

According to the report from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), this event led to severe flooding in 31 out of the 36 federal states of Nigeria, with Adamawa being among the worst affected.[5][3] One of the main causes of the flood was the increased water flows from the Cameroonian highlands, which drained into the Benue River and its tributaries. The water level of the Benue River rose significantly, exceeding its normal capacity and overflowing its banks. The situation was worsened by the release of water from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon, which added more pressure to the already swollen river.[6] Another cause of the flood was the heavy rainfall that occurred in Adamawa State and other parts of Nigeria during the rainy season. The rainfall exceeded the average annual precipitation and saturated the soil, reducing its infiltration capacity and increasing surface runoff. The runoff collected in low-lying areas and formed flash floods that swept away houses, farmlands, and other properties.[7]"

The flood also submerged 153 communities across 12 Local Government Areas (LGAs) within Adamawa State, affecting about 260,000 people.[7] The flood also caused extensive damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and other sectors. It destroyed or damaged houses, roads, bridges, schools, health facilities, and other public amenities. It also washed away crops, livestock, food stocks, and other assets. The flood disrupted economic activities, such as farming, fishing, trading, and transportation. It also increased the risk of waterborne diseases, such as cholera and typhoid.[7] According to NEMA, the flooding in 2023 resulted in the displacement of numerous inhabitants, risking croplands and infrastructure. In total, 159,157 individuals were affected, 28 people died, and 48,168 people were displaced in 13 states across Nigeria.[8][9][10]"

The RNA covered six sectors: shelter and non-food items (NFIs), food security and livelihoods (FSL), health, water sanitation and hygiene (WASH), protection, and education.[7] Based on the RNA findings, NEMA and other humanitarian partners provided emergency assistance to the affected population. This included distributing relief items such as tents, mattresses, blankets, mosquito nets, cooking utensils, hygiene kits, and food rations. It also included providing health services, such as mobile clinics, immunization, and disease surveillance. It also included improving water supply, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, such as boreholes, latrines, and handwashing stations. It also included supporting protection activities, such as registering and tracing displaced persons, providing psychosocial support, and preventing gender-based violence. It also included restoring education services, such as rehabilitating schools, providing learning materials, and training teachers.[7]"

The 19th named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Tammy formed on October\u00a05 off the east coast of Florida from the interaction of a tropical wave and a trough. After strengthening to a peak intensity of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km), the storm made landfall in northeastern Florida. Tammy moved into the U.S. state of Georgia, degenerating into a remnant low pressure area, which was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Tammy and its remnants contributed to ten fatalities. The storm first affected Florida. Total damages from the storm were $30\u00a0million."

        "content": "The precursor to Tammy was a tropical wave that left the western coast of Africa on September 24. The wave moved across the Atlantic without any development until October\u00a02, when it started to interact with a mid- to upper-level large trough north of the Lesser Antilles. The system produced an area of convection, or thunderstorms, which spawned a surface trough, although it failed to organize at first due to strong wind shear. The trough moved generally to the northwest, steered by a subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic.[1] On October\u00a04, the central pressure dropped as the trough approached the east coast of Florida, toward an area of lower wind shear.[2][1] Early on October\u00a05, a circulation developed within the convection, leading to the formation of Tropical Storm Tammy just 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) east of Jupiter, Florida. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) immediately designated Tammy as a tropical storm due to the presence of gale-force winds.[1] After its formation, Tammy was moving to the north-northwest, parallel to Florida's east coast, with most of the thunderstorms located northeast of the center.[3] The storm was influenced by a developing extratropical cyclone over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the interaction caused an increase in convection. Based on observations from a reconnaissance flight, as well as two nearby ships, the NHC estimated that Tammy strengthened to attain peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km) late on October\u00a05. At 23:00\u00a0UTC that day, the storm made landfall in northeastern Florida near Atlantic Beach. Tammy soon after moved into the state of Georgia, weakening into a tropical depression and degenerating into a remnant low late on October\u00a06. The low accelerated and turned southwestward, moving across southeastern Alabama and the Florida panhandle before reaching the Gulf of Mexico. On October\u00a07, the remnants of Tammy were absorbed by an extratropical low over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which was attached to a cold front that moved up the east coast of the United States over the next two days.[1][4] On October\u00a08, the cold front stalled over the Mid-Atlantic before moving off the coast the next day.[5]"

The Glynn County Emergency Operations Agency monitored and prepared for Tropical Storm Tammy's landfall, however the poor warning hampered their efforts. Residents all over the state expressed frustration at the lack of time they had to prepare.[10] When Tammy moved inland 12\u00a0hours later[7] the southern end of the warning zone moved north to Altamaha Sound, Georgia before all warnings were discontinued on October 6.[1]"

Its highest sustained winds were 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and its strongest recorded wind gust was 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[1] The winds produced no significant damage, but did disrupt power to 16,500\u00a0utility customers[11] and delayed the Trysail College Regatta.[12] Lightning produced by a thunderstorm in Broward County, Florida struck three teenagers during a football game in Coconut Creek, killing one and injuring the other two.[13] To most areas in north Florida and southern Georgia, Tammy brought 3 to 5\u00a0in (76 to 127\u00a0mm) of rain, though some isolated areas received 10 inches (250\u00a0mm).[14] In Georgia, flooding damaged over 30\u00a0homes in Brunswick.[15] Several dirt and coastal roads were washed out,[14] and sewers overflowed as far north as Baltimore County, Maryland.[16] Two small pond dams burst, including a 173-year-old wooden dam, but new stone dams were constructed in place before the old ones failed.[11] Conversely, Tammy's rains were beneficial in South Carolina, where they helped alleviate dry conditions[17] after a rainless September.[18] Tammy's storm surge was approximately 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) and caused salt-water flooding along the coast of northeastern Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.[19] The surge damages boardwalks along the coast, and wave action causes over 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of beach erosion.[1] In addition to the flooding, Tropical Storm Tammy spawned one tornado.[20] Rated an F0 tornado, it touched down near Brunswick, Georgia where it snapped trees and caused moderate roof damage along its 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) path.[21] The storm's total damage was estimated at $30\u00a0million (2005\u00a0USD).[1] The outer bands of Tammy brought heavy rains, peaking around 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) in places,[22] and caused significant beach erosion. Winds along the coastline gusted up to 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), downing numerous trees. The worst damage occurred in Beaufort County where 30 trees were downed, one of which fell on a home. Rough seas undermined several beach homes and caused one to be condemned.[23]"

The rains caused floods that led to four deaths \u2013 four people died in Alstead from a 20 to 30\u00a0ft (6.1 to 9.1\u00a0m) wave; two people in Unity were swept away driving over a damaged bridge; a kayaker was lost and presumed dead in Antrim.[27][28][29] Precipitation reached 11.36\u00a0in (289\u00a0mm) in Montebello in Nelson County, Virginia, 11.70\u00a0in (297\u00a0mm) in 12.05\u00a0in (306\u00a0mm) in New Windsor in New York, and 11.96\u00a0in (304\u00a0mm) in Brunswick, Maine.[24][30][26][31] The most significant damage occurred in New Hampshire, where the rains reached 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) in Gilford in Belknap County. In Alstead, an embankment along the Cold River failed. The resulting floods destroyed 40\u00a0homes, washed out a bridge, and knocked down 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km) of power lines. Statewide, about 1,000\u00a0people evacuated due to the floods. Damage in New Hampshire totaled over $13\u00a0million.[29][27][28] Governor John Lynch declared a state of emergency because of the floods.[32] In neighboring Vermont, the rains triggered a landslide in North Pomfret. Rains in the state reached 6.40\u00a0in (163\u00a0mm), causing minor street flooding.[33] In Maine, the rains caused river flooding across the southern portion of the state.[31] Across the Mid-Atlantic, the rains caused flooding that led to power outages and dozens of road closures. Across Maryland, high waters forced 32\u00a0people to be evacuated from their homes or vehicles.[25][24] The rains knocked down trees in Virginia, including one that fell onto a home in Quantico, Virginia.[34] In Washington, D.C., a downed tree fell onto wires near Union Station, which delayed Amtrak service for two and a half hours.[35] In Delaware, the rains caused crop damage and low-lying flooding.[36] In northeastern Pennsylvania, the rains forced 31\u00a0houses to evacuate. Two boys in Allentown required rescued from firefighters after climbing a tree to escape floodwaters. The rains caused a landslide in Easton, closing a street. The Lehigh Valley International Airport recorded its wettest day ever on October\u00a07 during the storm.[26] In adjacent New Jersey, rainfall reached 9.84\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) in Andover. In Ramsey, the floods closed two bridges and destroyed a driveway.[5][37] The town of Highlands, New York declared a state of emergency after floodwaters 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) covered parts of the town, including NY 293 and U.S. Route 9W.[30] In Springfield, Massachusetts, the rains caused the roof of an apartment building to collapse. In Greenfield, a swollen river flooded a mobile home park, leaving 35\u00a0homes uninhabitable, and leaving 75\u00a0people homeless.

Rising fuel prices and dwindling demand has already created tough conditions that year, but the disruption of several days' fishing due to Tammy escalated the situation.[42] Just days after the remnants of Tammy exited the east coast of the United States, the remnants of a subtropical depression brought additional rainfall to the region, with two people killed in Connecticut due to the floods.[43][44] Much of the northeastern United States from Delaware to Maine had record rainfall in October 2005, partly because of the remnants of Tammy and later the remnants of Hurricane Wilma.[45] The series of floods led to a presidential disaster declaration for portions of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided more than $13\u00a0million in funds to Massachusetts. The Federal Highway Administration provided $24\u00a0million to New England states following flood damage, most of which went to New Hampshire.[46][47][32] Two years after the floods destroyed several mobile homes in Greenfield, Massachusetts, the city purchased the land and turned it into protected greenspace, using state and federal funds.[39] In 2015, the town of Alstead, New Hampshire installed a plaque to commemorate the 10 year anniversary of the floods.[28]"

Significant flooding was reported, and the majority of the structures were destroyed. However, few injuries were reported, and the island's facilities were restored the next year. Typhoon Olive remains one of the most intense tropical cyclones to affect the island."

The system moved slowly westward across the Arabian Sea, steered by a ridge to north. Warm water temperatures favored further development, despite moderate wind shear.[3] Early on September\u00a022, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression, and soon upgraded it to a deep depression.[2] Late on September\u00a022, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system, designating it Tropical Cyclone 03A. At the time, the storm had a compact area of thunderstorms, supported by outflow from the south.[4] Due to decreasing wind shear and warm, moist air, the system quickly intensified on September\u00a023, prompting the IMD to upgrade the system to Cyclonic Storm Hikaa; later that day the agency upgraded the storm further to a severe cyclonic storm.[2] During the strengthening phase, an eye feature formed in the center of the convection, indicative of strengthening.[5] Considering the storm a \"midget tropical cyclone\", the JTWC upgraded Hikaa to the equivalent of hurricane status late on September\u00a023, while the storm was approaching eastern Oman.[6] The IMD followed suit, upgrading Hikaa to a very severe cyclonic storm on September\u00a024, estimating peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[2] Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph), based in part on the 26\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) eye in the center of the convection.[6] As Hikaa was nearing land, the eye deteriorated, and the JTWC assessed that the storm weakened.[7] The IMD meanwhile assessed that the cyclone maintained its peak intensity. Around 14:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, Hikaa made landfall in eastern Oman just north of Duqm, becoming the first very severe cyclonic storm on record to strike the country in September. Before Hikaa, only two depressions had struck Oman in the month of September, in 1929 and 1979.[2] The storm quickly weakened over land, as dry air and land interaction diminished the convection.[8] Early on September\u00a025, the IMD downgraded Hikaa to a deep depression, and later to a low-pressure area, by which time the storm was near the border of Oman and Saudi Arabia.[2]"

About 750\u00a0people evacuated to nine shelters in Al Wusta Governorate, where Hikaa moved ashore.[11] In Duqm near where Hikaa struck Oman, the airport recorded sustained winds of 96\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph), with gusts to 124\u00a0km/h (77\u00a0mph).[10] Hikaa dropped heavy rainfall as it struck eastern Oman, reaching 80\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in) in some locations.[2] The storm also produced 3 to 4\u00a0m (9.8 to 13.1\u00a0ft) waves.[11] A deep-sea fishing boat with a crew of 11 capsized off of Masirah Island during the storm; there were five confirmed fatalities from the shipwreck, and one person was rescued.[12][13] On the Omani mainland, Hikaa flooded roads and wadis \u2013 typically dry riverbeds. In Haima, six people required rescue when they were trapped on a bus in floodwaters.[11] Aon estimated the damage total in the \"millions\", based on hundreds of properties reporting damage.[14]"

The rise in the ocean's temperature is linked with air currents, of Central American origin, that move in the southern direction. These currents assist with the warming of the sea and with the arrival of warm waters from Asia and Oceania. As they passed by the coasts of Ecuador and Peru, the warm water currents didn't encounter a sufficiently strong trade wind barrier that could prevent their forceful arrival.[5] The warm water is characterized to be superficial and to evaporate easily; it also increases temperatures to 29 degrees Celsius which generates an unstable atmosphere and constant rain.[6]"

This event would have been a Coastal Ni\u00f1o due to the fact that it was a phenomenon that in a localized manner largely affected the Peruvian coast, but without a larger influence on the global climate it probably would not be related to the weather pattern referred to as ENSO, (El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation). The 1891 event was the first of the era that was scientifically studied thanks to the Geographic Society of Lima. It lasted from February to April and would have been caused by the abnormal oceanic heating influenced by the currents of El Ni\u00f1o. The NOAA considers the precedent of 1891 as a warming event of Peru that is within the most severe events to have occurred in the last 300 years.[7] It caused large disasters and more than two thousand casualties in Peru. The 1925 Ni\u00f1o was also a Coastal Ni\u00f1o that affected Peru and Ecuador between the months of February and April.[8] It originated from the appearance of the currents of El Ni\u00f1o, where a rapid warming of the sea took place, with the development of the phenomenon during the simultaneous event of the Global Ni\u00f1o (this contradiction is called the Modoki Ni\u00f1a). Equal to that which occurred in 2017 it weakened the southern trade winds, with an intense development of the tropical rain belt and a corresponding association to an intense Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) south of the equator."

As a result of favorable environmental conditions, the wave developed into a tropical depression on July\u00a04, and further into Tropical Storm Erick at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05. Steered generally west-northwest, Erick intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane and reached its peak intensity with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) on July\u00a06. Its proximity to land and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to deteriorate into a tropical storm the following day, though it remained at such intensity until degenerating into a remnant low early on July\u00a09. The remnant circulation dissipated a few hours later, southwest of Baja California Sur. In preparation for the cyclone, numerous tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for various portions of the coastline of Mexico. Ports were closed and residents in low-lying areas were asked to evacuate to higher grounds. In addition, shipping by means of boat was suspended. Though the center of Erick remained offshore, the outer bands of the system brought gusty winds and isolated heavy rainfall to Western Mexico. In Guerrero, minor flooding was reported in the cities of Acapulco and Puerto Marques. A river overflowed its banks in Nayarit, flooding several cities in the state. Numerous cars, streets, and homes were damaged by flooding. A woman died as she attempted to flee her house, while a man was killed after being swept away by the river. Hundreds of people were rescued by the Mexican military and Nayarit officials. Across Baja California Sur, the storm produced widespread precipitation, leading to flooding."

        "content": "On June\u00a018, a tropical wave emerged off the western coastline of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic. Tracking steadily westward, it maintained a small but organized area of convection\u2014shower and thunderstorm activity\u2014along its axis for the next several days. The wave crossed the Lesser Antilles on June\u00a024 and Central America on June\u00a029, emerging into the eastern Pacific shortly thereafter.[1] During the evening of July\u00a01, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system, noting that environmental conditions were expected to become favorable for slow development.[2] The wave interacted with a larger area of low pressure on July\u00a02, leading to an increase in convective coverage and the formation of a broad low-pressure area. Continuing slowly westward, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression at 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04, while centered 205\u00a0mi (330\u00a0km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico.[1] Despite the initially exposed center of circulation, a byproduct of moderate wind shear, the depression soon began to organize as convective banding increased and gained more curvature.[3] This led to the classification of Tropical Storm Erick at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05.[1] Under the influence of a mid-level ridge over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and an upper-level ridge over the southwestern United States, the newly upgraded Erick tracked west-northwest parallel to the coastline of Mexico.[4] A central dense overcast formed by the daylight hours of July\u00a05, with tight banding noted on satellite. In addition, microwave imagery indicated the formative stages of an eyewall.[5] Initially vertically decoupled, the storm became more vertically aligned throughout the following hours. A ragged eye became intermittently visible on satellite, and Erick was upgraded to Category\u00a01 hurricane status at 0600\u00a0UTC, located approximately 105\u00a0mi (170\u00a0km) west-southwest of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Mexico.[1][6] In conjunction with satellite intensity estimates, it is estimated that Erick attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983\u00a0mb (hPa; 29.03\u00a0inHg) at 1200\u00a0UTC. Shortly thereafter, its proximity to the coastline of Mexico and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to begin a weakening trend.[7] At 1800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a07, Erick weakened to a tropical storm as its associated convective mass warmed and the eye deteriorated.[8] Wind shear caused the center of circulation to become exposed on July\u00a09 as the system passed just south of Baja California Sur,[9] leading to degeneration into a remnant low-pressure area at 0600\u00a0UTC. The remnant vortex persisted for a few more hours, before dissipating over cold sea surface temperatures at 0000 UTC on July 10.[1]"

By 0300\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05, the watch was extended from Acapulco to Manzanillo, while a tropical storm warning was issued from L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas to Manzanillo. Several hours later, the watch was discontinued for the coastline stretching from Acapulco to L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and issued from La Fortuna to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Meanwhile, the warning from L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas to Manzanillo was discontinued, with a new warning issued from Zihuatanejo to La Fortuna. All tropical storm watches in effect were discontinued by 0300\u00a0UTC the following morning, with the warning being extended from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. After being upgraded to a hurricane, Erick prompted the issuance of hurricane watches stretching from Punta San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes. At 1500\u00a0UTC on July\u00a06, a tropical storm watch was issued from Santa Fe to La Paz, though this was upgraded to a warning several hours later. Following many other revisions, all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued after Erick degenerated into a remnant low early on July\u00a09.[1] In preparation for the tropical cyclone, an \"orange\" alert was issued for southern Michoac\u00e1n, southern Jalisco, and the entire state of Colima, while a \"yellow\" alert was posted for the rest of the Jalisco coastline.[10] The ports of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo, and Manzanillio were closed.[11] In fear of flash flooding, residents along low-lying areas of Acapulco were urged to evacuate.[12] Meanwhile, the government of Michoac\u00e1n ordered the suspension of shipping by boat.[13] Despite remaining offshore, the outer rainbands of the storm affected the southwestern coastline with gusty winds and heavy rainfall,[11] with similar effects farther northwest.[14] In Acapulco and Puerto Marques, the storm was responsible for minor flooding.[15] Elsewhere across the state, damage was minor and mostly due to landslides.[16] Along the coast of Colima, waves up to 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) were recorded.[17] Although some flooding was reported across the state, damage was considered minor.[18] Further north, Erick brought extensive flood damage to Nayarit.[19] A 74-year-old woman died while trying to escape her flooded house, while dozens of vehicles were damaged and several other streets and homes were flooded. One river overflowed its banks, affecting numerous cities. Officials in Nayarit attempted to rescue hundreds of people affected by Hurricane Erick,[19] many of whom waited on streets to be rescued.[20] Dozens of families were directly affected by the storm. Substantial amounts of debris piled up on streets. Residents reported severe economical losses, especially in Xalisco, where a disaster declaration was necessary. Offshore, a waterspout was reported.[18] In Tepic, Governor Roberto Sandoval ordered a state of emergency.[20] Damages from the storm in Nayarit totaled to MXN$386.4 million (USD$21.8 million).[21] Although the core of the system remained offshore, a \"yellow\" alert was issued for Baja California Sur. Heavy rain was recorded over much of the peninsula, resulting in flooding. The ports of La Paz, Cabo San Lucas, and San Jose del Cabo were closed due to high waves.[22] Additionally, a \"green\" alert was issued for Baja California.[23] In all, two people were killed while two others were missing.[24]"

Some stretches of the High Street were submerged in 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) of water.[2]  According to reports, the whole of Yarm lay underwater, every building was affected, six houses were destroyed and many more left uninhabitable.[9] The Shambles was washed away and the town's main church was also damaged. Nine of the townspeople also died.[2] To the west, the River Eden also rose and affected Carlisle and Botcherby Mill, flooding the church,[10] as did Solway Moss, flooding local farms and settlements.[11]"

        "content": " The 1975 Atlantic hurricane season was a near average hurricane season with nine named storms forming, of which six became hurricanes. Three of those six became major hurricanes, which are Category\u00a03 (130\u00a0mph (209\u00a0km/h) sustained winds) or higher systems on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The season officially began on June\u00a01 and lasted until November\u00a030. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first system, Tropical Depression One, developed on June\u00a024. Tropical Storm Amy in July caused minor beach erosion and coastal flooding from North Carolina to New Jersey, and killed one person when a ship capsized offshore North Carolina. Hurricane Blanche brought strong winds to portions of Atlantic Canada, leaving about $6.2\u00a0million (1975\u00a0USD) in damage. Hurricane Caroline brought high tides and flooding to northeastern Mexico and Texas, with two drownings in the latter. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Eloise, a Category\u00a03 hurricane that struck the Florida Panhandle at peak intensity, after bringing severe flooding to the Caribbean. Eloise caused 80\u00a0fatalities, including 34\u00a0in Puerto Rico, 7\u00a0in Dominican Republic, 18\u00a0in Haiti, and 21\u00a0in the United States, with 4\u00a0in Florida. The hurricane left about $560\u00a0million in damage in the United States. Hurricane Gladys, a Category\u00a04 hurricane, was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, but left little impact on land. Also, it was the first tropical storm to be upgraded to a hurricane based solely on satellite imagery.[1] Two tropical depressions also caused damage and fatalities. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this season resulted in 87\u00a0deaths and about $564.7\u00a0million in damage."

        "content": "The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June\u00a01,[2] with the first tropical cyclone developing on June\u00a024. Although 23\u00a0tropical depressions developed, only nine of them reached tropical storm intensity;[3] this was near normal compared to the 1950\u20132000\u00a0average of 9.6\u00a0named storms.[4] Six of these reached hurricane status,[3] slightly above the 1950\u20132000\u00a0average of 5.9.[4] Furthermore, three storms reached major hurricane status;[3] above the 1950\u20132000\u00a0average of 2.3.[4] Collectively, the cyclones of this season caused at least 84\u00a0deaths and over $564.7\u00a0million in damage.[5] The Atlantic hurricane season officially ended on November\u00a030,[2] though the final cyclone became extratropical on December\u00a013.[3] Tropical cyclogenesis began in June, with the development of a tropical depression on June\u00a024, followed by Tropical Storm Amy on June\u00a027. Four systems originated in July, including Hurricane Blanche. After Tropical Depression Six dissipated on July\u00a030, tropical activity went dormant for over three weeks, ending with the development of Hurricane Caroline on August\u00a024. Another cyclone, Hurricane Doris, also formed in August. September was the most active month of the season, featuring eight tropical cyclones, including hurricanes Eloise, Faye, and Gladys. In October, four systems formed, one of which intensified into Tropical Storm Hallie. Two tropical depressions developed in November. The last system, a subtropical storm, formed on December\u00a06 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on December\u00a013.[3] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 76.[6] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h). Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reexamines the data. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value.[6]"

Upon nearing the coast of the Carolinas, the depression turned sharply eastward ahead of a rapidly approaching trough. Early on June\u00a029, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Amy offshore North Carolina. Further intensification occurred and the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 981\u00a0mbar (981\u00a0hPa; 29.0\u00a0inHg) by July\u00a02.[3] During most of the storm's existence, Amy featured many subtropical characteristics \u2013 both tropical and extratropical characteristics \u2013 but was not classified as such due to the proximity to land.[7] By July\u00a04, the system moved southeast of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical. The remnants continued rapidly northeastward and soon dissipated.[3] The main effects from Amy were rough seas, reaching up to 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) in height, that were felt from North Carolina to New Jersey, inflicting minor coastal flooding and beach erosion.[7][8] The storm also brought generally light rainfall to land, peaking at 5.87\u00a0in (149\u00a0mm) in Belhaven, North Carolina.[9] Offshore North Carolina, a schooner carrying four people capsized on June\u00a030, resulting in the death of the father of the other three crew members. They remained at sea for roughly 15 days before being rescued by a Greek merchant ship.[10]"

The system remained weak for about a week, before convection began increasing significantly on July\u00a021. After wind shear decreased,[7] the wave managed to develop into a tropical depression on July\u00a024 about 355 miles (571\u00a0km) northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands. It moved northwestward until early on July\u00a026,[3] when an approaching cold front and associated trough caused the depression to turn northeastward.[7] Around that time, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Blanche.[3] A weakening cold front and baroclinic forces created an environment favorable for intensifying,[7] allowing Blanche to become a Category\u00a01 hurricane on July\u00a027. Slightly further deepening occurred, with the storm peaking with winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg). Before 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a028, Blanche made landfall in Barrington, Nova Scotia, with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). The system quickly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which soon dissipated.[3] In Atlantic Canada, the remnants of Blanche produced high winds gusts up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), along with moderate rainfall, peaking at 3.1\u00a0in (79\u00a0mm) in Chatham, New Brunswick.[11] The strong winds knocked over two mobile homes and destroyed a slaughterhouse, which was under construction. Additionally, trees and power lines were downed, leaving between 500 and 1,000\u00a0customers without electricity. The electrical corporation in Nova Scotia suffered about $196,600 in damage. Telephone services were also interrupted. The A. Murray MacKay Bridge was closed after an oil rig broke loose and threatened to strike the bridge. In Prince Edward Island, flights to and from the Charlottetown Airport were canceled, as was ferry service to Nova Scotia. In the province, many homes and businesses lost telephone service. Overall, damage in Canada reached about $6.2\u00a0million.[12]"

Once inland, the depression slowly weakened and re-curved northwestward on July\u00a030 into Mississippi. Around that time, the depression dissipated.[3] The remnants persisted at least until August\u00a03, at which time it was situated over Arkansas.[13] The tropical depression dropped heavy rainfall, with some areas of the Florida Panhandle experiencing more than 20\u00a0in (510\u00a0mm) of precipitation, with a maximum total of 20.84\u00a0in (529\u00a0mm) observed in DeFuniak Springs.[9] Bay, Gulf, Holmes, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Wakulla, and Walton were hardest hit. Numerous roads were flooded and closed, with $3.2\u00a0million in damage to that infrastructure. About 500\u00a0homes suffered flood damage, 22 of which were destroyed. Damage is estimated to have reached $8.5\u00a0million in the state of Florida alone.[14] In southern Alabama, overflowing rivers flooded several businesses and homes in Brewton and East Brewton. Damage in Alabama totaled approximately $300,000.[15] In Mississippi, about 50\u00a0families in the vicinity of the Biloxi River were evacuated as the river threatened to exceed its banks,[16] while at least 70\u00a0families fled their homes in Moss Point. Water entered about a dozen homes there. Further north, about 100\u00a0residences were evacuated in Canton, where some businesses suffered water damage.

After emerging into the Caribbean Sea, the cyclone headed west-northwestward beginning on August\u00a027. By the following day, the depression entered into the Gulf of Mexico after passing just offshore the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The system then intensified into Tropical Storm Caroline early on August\u00a029 and hurricane by 00:00\u00a0UTC the following day. Further strengthening occurred, with the storm peaking as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 963\u00a0mbar (28.4\u00a0inHg) early on August\u00a031. Around that time, Caroline made landfall in a rural area of Tamaulipas, located in northeastern Mexico. The system rapidly weakened and dissipated on September\u00a01.[3] In Mexico, the storm produced 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) storm tides along the coast, while 5\u201310\u00a0in (130\u2013250\u00a0mm) of rain fell inland. Flooding rains forced 1,000\u00a0people to evacuate and left moderate damage to homes and businesses. The precipitation ended an eight-month drought that was affecting inland portions of northern Mexico and decreasing the area's corn production.[19] Along the coast, several small villages sustained significant damage from the hurricane's storm surge.[20] Portions of south Texas also experienced heavy rainfall, with 11.93\u00a0in (303\u00a0mm) at Port Isabel.[9] Brownsville broke a record for the highest amount of precipitation observed on a day in August.[21] Two deaths occurred from drowning in Galveston.[22]"

Because the system was out of the authorized range of reconnaissance aircraft flights, satellites and ships were used to monitor the storm's intensity and tropical status. After satellite imagery indicated that the system became more symmetrical, developed CDO, and detached from the frontal system,[7] the cyclone was reclassified as Tropical Storm Doris on August\u00a029.[3] Doris made meteorological history when, on August\u00a031, it became the first Atlantic hurricane ever to be upgraded to hurricane intensity solely on the basis of satellite pictures,[1] via the Dvorak technique.[7] The cyclone then curved northward and intensified further during the next few days, becoming a Category\u00a02 hurricane early on September\u00a02.[3] Based on the Dvorak technique, it is estimated that Doris peaked with maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg) shortly thereafter. By September\u00a03, the hurricane began interacting with a non-tropical low pressure area.[7] On the following day, Doris quickly weakened to a tropical storm and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 830\u00a0mi (1,340\u00a0km) south-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, around 06:00\u00a0UTC.

Eloise briefly reached hurricane intensity soon thereafter, but weakened back to a tropical storm around landfall over Hispaniola. The cyclone emerged into open waters of the northern Caribbean Sea. After striking the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Eloise turned northward and re-intensified. In the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclone quickly deepened, becoming a Category\u00a03 hurricane on September\u00a023.

The storm's severe winds, waves, and storm surge left numerous beaches, piers, and other coastal structures heavily impaired.[23] Wind-related damage extended into inland Alabama and Georgia.[7] Further north, torrential rains along the entire East Coast of the United States created an unprecedented and far-reaching flooding event, especially into the Mid-Atlantic States.[26] In that region, an additional 17 people died as a result of freshwater flooding from the post-tropical storm;[23] infrastructural and geological effects were comparable to those from Hurricane Agnes three years prior.[26] Across the United States, damage amounted to approximately $560\u00a0million.[7] The storm killed 80\u00a0people along its entire track.[23]"

After detaching from the Intertropical Convergence Zone on September\u00a018,[7] the wave quickly developed into a tropical depression about 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) west of the Cabo Verde Islands.[3] Moving northwestward, the depression intensified, according to ships and satellite imagery,[7] becoming Tropical Storm Faye on September\u00a019.[3] The cyclone then moved westward and was unable to intensify further due to increasing wind shear,[7] before weakening to a tropical depression on September\u00a023.[3] Shortly thereafter, Faye turned to the north, crossing an upper trough axis over the central Atlantic. Southwesterly flow aloft allowed the system to re-strengthen,[7] with Faye becoming a tropical storm again on September\u00a025. Faye accelerated to the northwest and deepened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane early on September\u00a026, several hours before reaching Category\u00a02 intensity.[3] Around 23:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026, the cyclone passed about 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) east of Bermuda. Winds up to 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) and heavy rains were recorded on the island.[27] Up to 2.8\u00a0in (71\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Bermuda from the hurricane.[9] Already severely impacted by flooding from Eloise days earlier, New England prepared for additional flooding from Faye. The National Weather Service issued flash flood watches, resulting in more evacuations.[28] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a027, the hurricane reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[3] Later that day, Faye curved northeast under strong westerly flow.[7] Although the system weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane late on September\u00a028, the storm reached its minimum barometric pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg),[3] observed by a reconnaissance aircraft.[7] Faye then curved eastward and lost tropical characteristics, becoming extratropical at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029, while situated northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores.[3]"

A well-defined eye became visible on satellite imagery by September\u00a030.[7] As the storm tracked to the east of the Bahamas, a curve to the north began, at which time an anticyclone developed atop the cyclone.[7] This subsequently allowed Gladys to rapidly intensify into a Category 4 hurricane, reaching maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 939\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg) on October 2. Thereafter, Gladys began to weaken and passed very close to Cape Race, Newfoundland, before losing tropical characteristics on October\u00a03 while situated about 385\u00a0mi (620\u00a0km) northeast of St. John's.[3] Subsequently, the remnants merged with a large extratropical cyclone on October\u00a03. Effects from the system along the East Coast of the United States were minimal, although heavy rainfall and rough seas were reported.[7] In Newfoundland, strong winds and light precipitation were observed.[29]"

Early on October\u00a017, the depression made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana.[3] Shortly thereafter, the depression became an extratropical cyclone as it through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, before moving offshore New England.[30] Heavy rains fell along the frontal boundary ahead of the system,[30] with a peak total of 9.01\u00a0in (229\u00a0mm) of precipitation observed in Aimwell, Louisiana.[9] Flooding occurred across eastern Louisiana, central Mississippi, the western Florida Panhandle, central Tennessee, western Virginia, and eastern New York. In Jackson, Mississippi, the heavy precipitation established a new daily rainfall record for October\u00a016 and a new 24-hour rainfall record for the month of October. Eight bridges were damaged in Jackson County, Tennessee, due to the floods. Heavy rains left heavy damage to the soybean and corn crops in Hickman and Marion counties in Tennessee. Six tornadoes were reported in association with this tropical depression, including two in Alabama, two in northwest Florida, and two in North Carolina.

The system developed into a subtropical depression by October\u00a024, while located about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) east of Florida. The depression drifted northward on October\u00a025 and eventually acquired tropical characteristics by October\u00a026. Due to tropical storm force winds, the system was reclassified as Tropical Storm Hallie, while situated about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) east of Charleston, South Carolina. Hallie accelerated to the northeast starting on October\u00a026. By the following day, Hallie peaked with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Later that day, Hallie merged with a frontal zone and became extratropical offshore Virginia.[31][32] The precursor to Hallie produced extensive cloudiness precipitation in the Bahamas.[33]\nOn October\u00a027, gale warnings were issued for portions of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and small craft advisories were posted for coastal areas from Georgia to Virginia.[34] Tides along the North Carolina and Virginia coasts were generally between 1 and 2\u00a0ft (0.30 and 0.61\u00a0m) above normal. Generally light precipitation fell, peaking at 2.55\u00a0in (65\u00a0mm) in Manteo, North Carolina.[33] Additionally, the pressure gradient between Hallie and a high pressure area increased winds across much of the East Coast of the United States.[31]"

Tropical Depression Three formed northeast of the Bahamas on July\u00a04. Tracking northeastward, the system did not intensify and was last noted over open waters midday on July\u00a05.[3] Tropical Depression Five formed on July\u00a024 over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Deep convection associated with the system persisted around the center of circulation.[7] Forecasters anticipated the depression would intensify into a tropical storm before landfall.[35] A reconnaissance mission into the cyclone found 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) winds; however, due to the interaction with land, the NHC did not upgrade the depression. Not long after forming, the depression struck Tampico, Tamaulipas. A barometric pressure of 1,007\u00a0mbar (1,007\u00a0hPa; 29.7\u00a0inHg) was recorded in the city, along with sustained winds of 37\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h). The system was no longer monitored by the NHC after landfall and quickly dissipated on July\u00a026.[7] On September 3, two tropical depressions developed near Cabo Verde. The westernmost, designated Tropical Depression Nine, tracked generally westward and eventually dissipated near the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a09. The easternmost, Tropical Depression Ten, also moved westward and dissipated on September\u00a06. Short-lived Tropical Depression Eleven developed that same day, then degenerated the next. Tropical Depression Twelve developed near Bermuda on September\u00a011. Initially, the depression drifted northeastward but later accelerated and dissipated by September\u00a014.[3] Tropical Depression Sixteen developed near the Gulf of Honduras on September\u00a025 and tracked slowly westward. By September\u00a028, the depression made landfall in northern Belize before dissipating two days later. Tropical Depression Seventeen developed to the west of the Canary Islands on October\u00a03, moving northwestward and then northeastward before dissipating southwest of the Azores on October\u00a05. Tropical Depression Twenty formed on October\u00a027 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea and tracked northwest. After turning nearly due west, the depression briefly made landfall near the Nicaragua\u2013Honduras border and made another landfall in southern Belize shortly before dissipating on October\u00a029.[3] On November\u00a08, Tropical Depression Twenty-One developed off the coast of Honduras. Moving north-northwestward, the system gradually intensified. Between November\u00a09 and 10, reconnaissance missions into the depression found winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h); however, the NHC did not upgrade it to a tropical storm, because weaken occurred shortly thereafter. Over the following few days, the system gradually turned southward and made landfall in the southwestern edge of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on November\u00a012, shortly before dissipating. In late November, Tropical Depression Twenty-Two formed over the central Atlantic. A short-lived system, it formed on November\u00a029 and dissipated on December\u00a01.[3]"

The storm increased in strength, and changed direction. The winds now blew from the northeast, and drove the water masses back in a south-westerly direction. Because the water could only flow slowly back into the North Sea, huge waves caught coastal dwellers by surprise on the morning of 13 November 1872 and caused floods over a metre high in coastal towns and villages."

        "content": " Tropical Storm Olga was a short-lived tropical cyclone that caused unexpectedly severe damage as a non-tropical system along its track across the Central United States in late October\u00a02019. The storm began as a distinct tropical wave that moved off Africa on October\u00a08 and organized into a tropical storm over the Bay of Campeche early on October\u00a025. It moved north-northeast, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone within 12\u00a0hours. The remnants of the cyclone made landfall in central Louisiana early on October\u00a026 and continued across the Eastern United States and into Ontario, where it dissipated on October\u00a028. The severity of the storm along its track from Louisiana through Tennessee caught meteorologists by surprise. Intense winds inflicted severe damage, and downed numerous trees onto homes, vehicles, and roadways. In Louisiana, power was cut to 132,000\u00a0customers statewide. A peak rainfall accumulation total of 10.24\u00a0in (260\u00a0mm) was observed near Ponchatoula, with lesser amounts across the state. The remnants of the storm continued into Mississippi, where 772\u00a0homes were damaged or lost, 26\u00a0businesses impacted, and 27\u00a0roads damaged or destroyed; effects were particularly severe in Tupelo. At least 154,000 power outages were reported across the state; in the storm's wake there, a 34-year-old man was killed cleaning tree debris, although this death was not acknowledged by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in its Tropical Cyclone Report. In Tennessee, a wide swath of winds up to 96\u00a0mph (154\u00a0km/h) resulted in nearly 65,000 power outages that forced school closures for up to two weeks in several counties, and a 63-year-old man was killed by a downed tree. Total damage along the path of the cyclone was estimated at $400\u00a0million."

        "content": "A well-organized tropical wave moved off the western coastline of Africa on October\u00a08. High wind shear across the tropical Atlantic hampered the wave from developing into a tropical cyclone even as it showed intermittent signs of convective organization. The disturbance progressed into the eastern Caribbean Sea on October\u00a017 and reached Central America five days later. After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula into the Bay of Campeche by October\u00a024, the wave spawned a broad area of low pressure. The diffuse circulation became better defined the next morning, when satellite-derived wind data indicated it was already producing gale-force winds. As such, the NHC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Olga at 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a025 when it was about 390 miles (630\u00a0km) south-southwest of Lake Charles, Louisiana.[1] The system's cloud pattern was characterized by a large cluster of deep thunderstorm activity within the northeastern quadrant.[2] A broad upper-level trough to the west of the newly formed cyclone directed it on a general northeastward course.[1] Shortly after the time of formation, a reconnaissance aircraft found that a cold front was already impinging on Olga's circulation, while maximum sustained winds had increased to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h); slightly stronger winds trailed the frontal boundary.[3] However, since the boundary had not yet moved through the system's circulation, Olga persisted as a tropical cyclone. The final passes conducted by the reconnaissance aircraft a few hours later found strong northwesterly flow and a sharp gradient in temperature and dew point near the center that had either been overtaken by the front or become poorly defined.[4] As such, Olga transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a026,[1] with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) as the earlier measurements behind the front became representative of the overall system.[4] It was positioned roughly 225 miles (362\u00a0km) south-southeast of Lake Charles at the time. The cyclone continued north-northeast and crossed the southeastern Louisiana coastline around 07:00\u00a0UTC. It progressed inland across the Eastern United States, crossed Lake Huron, and finally dissipated over southeastern Ontario by 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a028.[1]"

These winds were short in duration as the remnants of Olga moved rapidly north-northeast, but the severity of the storm caught meteorologists and local officials off guard.[9] The New Orleans and Lake Charles branches of the National Weather Service expressed their intention to further study the event in order to better prepare for similar systems in the future.[10] The energy companies Entergy and Cleco reported damage to 260 and 35 power poles, respectively;[11] Entergy reported the most significant damage throughout New Orleans and Hammond.[12] Gusty winds at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport caused two separate electrical disruptions, resulting in the delay or cancellation of multiple flights; citywide, power outages were estimated around 17,000.[13] At the nearby Voodoo Music + Arts Experience, events were delayed to allow recovery from storm damage. A 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m) tall LED video wall was blown down and saw its plastic panels shattered.[14] The Jazz Half marathon was also delayed until later in the morning. High winds damaged the perimeter fencing at the site of the Hard Rock Hotel collapse.[8] Statewide, the number of power outages peaked around 132,000\u00a0customers, principally in Tangipahoa Parish. About 92,000 of those outages were among Entergy customers while the other 40,000 were associated with Cleco.[15] The remnants of Olga also produced heavy rainfall, with a peak statewide accumulation of 10.24\u00a0in (260\u00a0mm) to the east of Ponchatoula.[1] Local amounts of 10\u201314\u00a0in (250\u2013360\u00a0mm) overspread Terrebonne Parish, while more widespread accumulations of 6\u20138\u00a0in (150\u2013200\u00a0mm) were recorded in portions of that parish northeastward into Washington Parish.[10] At the height of the storm, flash flood emergencies were issued for Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes.[15] The heavy rainfall brought challenges for sugarcane farmers who had already suffered in the wake of several heavy rainfall events in years past.[16] In spite of this fact, dry soil conditions in the lead-up to Olga's remnants alleviated concerns about river flooding. Only a few rivers reached flood stage and mainly minor flooding was reported across the state.[10] Water levels of 2\u20133\u00a0ft (0.61\u20130.91\u00a0m) above normal in southeastern Louisiana did cause minor coastal flooding there, including across the Mandeville Lakefront along the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Coastal flooding of 1\u20132\u00a0ft (0.30\u20130.61\u00a0m) affected the central Louisiana coastline around high tide.[10] Precipitation associated with Olga contributed to the second wettest year on record at New Orleans International Airport, after 1985.[17]"

A storm chaser recorded a peak, hurricane-force wind gust of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) near Ripley.[18] These strong winds downed countless trees, some up to 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) in diameter,[19] and caused extensive damage to structures and power lines across a 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) swath through Mississippi and into Tennessee. A 34-year-old man was killed on Highway 489 in Newton County when a tree fell on him as he cleaned up tree debris, although this was death was not included in the NHC's final report.[20] Union and Tippah counties each saw twenty roads closed by fallen trees and lines.[21][18] Four roads were also closed in Pontotoc County, where two tractor trailer trucks were overturned on US 278.[22] Roofing was ripped from houses, siding was torn from manufactured homes, and road signs were toppled.[23] Statewide, 772\u00a0homes were lost or damaged, 26\u00a0businesses were affected, and 27\u00a0roads were damaged or destroyed. At the height of the storm, at least 154,000 power outages were reported.[24] Disruption to the electrical grid was particularly severe around Tupelo. One of the main power providers, Tombigbee Electric Power Association, estimated over 19,000\u00a0residents were without power at one point.[25] Seventeen of the company's nineteen power substations suffered damage.[26] Tupelo Water & Light reported at least 25 power poles were downed.[25] Tupelo mayor Jason Shelton was trapped in his home and subsequently transferred to the hospital for injuries after a tree was downed on his home.[27] The former city automotive museum suffered structural damage when the outer wall of the storage portion of the building collapsed.[28] A fire station and car dealership were also damaged.[29] Farther north, Alcorn County also recorded widespread damage. About 16,000\u00a0people were without power at the storm's worst, and 50\u00a0residences remained without power even nine days later.[30] A state of emergency was declared, and schools throughout the county for closed for one day.[31] Similar school closures were recorded across Prentiss and Alcorn counties.[25] 4-County Electric Power Association reported more than 700\u00a0customers without power, mainly in Choctaw County,[32] while the East Mississippi Electric Power Association documented an additional 500 in Winston County,[25] and Prentiss County noted 700 more. Natchez Trace Electric Power Association, meanwhile, worked to restore power to the WTVA and WLOV-TV transmitters, allowing them to resume broadcasting at full power.[32][25] The maximum observed storm surge was 3.5\u00a0ft (1.1\u00a0m) above normal tide levels in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.[1] The combined effects of storm surge and normal tide rose water levels to 2\u20133\u00a0ft (0.61\u20130.91\u00a0m) above normal along the Mississippi coastline, resulting in minor coastal flooding across Hancock County.[10]"

While initial reports drew a connection between Olga and confirmed tornadoes across southwestern Alabama,[47] meteorologists later established them as separate weather events.[48] Moisture from Olga did, however, stream northward through Tuscaloosa, Alabama, producing an October accumulation record of 6.5\u00a0in (170\u00a0mm) there. Rainfall associated with Olga and preceding Tropical Storm Nestor contributed to monthly precipitation totals 150\u2013300\u00a0percent of average throughout Virginia, the western Carolinas, central Georgia, and western Alabama. This was beneficial to a region suffering from prolonged drought.[49] In Kentucky, winds up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) brought down numerous trees onto homes, vehicles, and roadways. Tractor trailers and a recreational vehicle were overturned on Interstate 24.[50] Rainfall accumulations of 2\u20133\u00a0in (51\u201376\u00a0mm) were commonplace across the western portions of the state, with lesser amounts elsewhere. This precipitation alleviated a flash drought[nb 1] from September.[52] Farther north in Ontario, already-high water levels on Lake Erie were exacerbated by strong winds, sustained at 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h) and gusting to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) in Port Colborne.[53] A water rise of at least 7.5\u00a0ft (2.3\u00a0m) was reported, causing the lake to overflow its banks and cause a number of road closures in Port Dover, Long Point, and Turkey Point.[54] The nearby Niagara River also caused local inundation and road closures as waves up to 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) crested over breakwaters across Fort Erie and Crystal Beach. Rainfall amounts of 1.2\u20131.6 inches (30\u201341\u00a0mm) were commonplace throughout southern Ontario, highest at 1.7\u00a0in (43\u00a0mm) on the opposing end of Lake Ontario in Oswego, New York.[53]"

Twenty-five workers from four neighboring power associations aided in clean up. Tupelo Public Works engaged in tree debris pick-up along roadways.[25] In Alcorn County, the American Red Cross established a shelter at the convention center to assist those without power; The Salvation Army provided it with food.[31] Even a month later, tree debris continued to litter the streets in the county seat of Corinth. Believing his city did not have sufficient funds to swiftly eliminate storm debris, the alderman looked to outside contractors for help.[61] He planned to open a declaration center within two weeks while working with local church groups to provide for those in need.[62] Ultimately, 11\u00a0companies offered support for the clean-up job. Three-quarters of the clean-up cost was handled by the Federal Emergency Management Association.[63] The city of Okolona planned to ask that agency for funds as well, and received $72,000 for repairs in January.[64] The Poplarville School Board of Trustees engaged with Mississippi Power to approve a $40,729 service agreement to repair damaged light poles.[65] Citing widespread and severe damage throughout the state, the Mississippi delegation to the United States Congress\u2014senators Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker, and representatives Bennie Thompson, Steven Palazzo, Trent Kelly, and Michael Guest\u2014penned a request to U.S. President Donald Trump for full consideration of Governor Phil Bryant's request for a major federal disaster declaration for 16\u00a0counties.[66] This request was approved a day later.[67] Throughout Tennessee, animal rescues were overwhelmed, especially in the rural counties of the state.[68] Local officials voiced concerns about electrocution, fire risk, and carbon monoxide given the widespread power outages; these concerns were magnified after two people suffered carbon monoxide poisoning while operating generators inside their homes.[69] In McNairy County, the Red Cross set up a shelter to distribute basic necessities. Schools in that county were closed for a week, while the prolonged power outages forced school closures for up to two weeks across Perry,[39] Humphreys,[40] Houston,[41] and Montgomery counties.[42] Eighteen counties across the state were selected by the Small Business Administration for disaster assistance to residents and businesses. The organization announced the opening of disaster-loan outreach centers for citizens to apply for low-interest disaster loans.[70] Over the following months, over 700,000\u00a0loans were approved.[71] In early December, senators Lamar Alexander and Marsha Blackburn, alongside representative Mark E. Green, backed Governor Bill Lee's request to President Trump for federal disaster assistance in ten counties. The members of Congress noted in their letter that eight of the ten counties requested for assistance were below the national poverty rate, and they noted the state had already spent $22 million in disaster response to date.[38] The request was approved that week.[72]"

However, due to the weather phenomenon La Ni\u00f1a, the dry season was not observed, and the rains have continued to fall.[2] To prevent the water level of the Brokopondo Reservoir from rising further, the Staatsolie Power Company Suriname N.V. (SPCS) opened the outlet valves of the Afobaka Dam on 28 February. The releases were carried out at intervals to prevent disruption in the villages at the lower end of the Suriname River.[3] The previous major flood was in 2006, which affected more than 170 villages.  Displaced residents moved to areas of higher elevation, or to French Guiana and Brazil. President Ronald Venetiaan had to request help from foreign countries. A flood of such magnitude had not occurred for a century prior.[4]"

At the offices of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Tourism (TCT) in Pokigron, located at the mouth of the Upper Suriname in the Brokopondo reservoir, water started to flow in.[5]  The Ministry of Regional Development and Sport (ROS) decided that day to evacuate all teachers from Sipaliwini District back to Paramaribo.[6] On March 10, more villages were affected.  Outposts of Medische Zending became more difficult to access: the clinics in Pokigron, Drietabbetje, Djoewee, Poesoegroenoe and Gonini had already been flooded. The police force of Gonini was moved to Stoelmanseiland with the help of the military.  Landing strips and schools were also flooded.[7] By 13 March, medical posts had been lost in many places in the country.  The floods had caused major economic damage.[8]  All schools in the affected areas were closed.[9] By 15 March 2022, after nearly a week of flooding, the affected area extended from Para District and Moengo in the north to the catchment basins of the Upper Saramacca, Upper Suriname, Tapanahoni, Lawa and Marowijne in the south.[7][9]"

This would cover one week of assistance. Vice President Ronnie Brunswijk observed the situation in flooded areas on 13 March from a helicopter, and showed his video recordings in the National Assembly.[9]  President Chan Santokhi visited Poesoegroenoe on 20 March; he wanted to visit more villages, but had to turn back due to bad weather conditions.[15] The Ministry of ROS has since the early days identified the need for aid packages in the affected areas.[6]  The National Coordination Centre for Disaster Control (NCCR) and the Surinamese Red Cross (SRK) monitored the situation on a daily basis.[7]  The NCCR distributed food, water and tarpaulins to the affected inhabitants.[16]  1100 emergency aid packages were provided in the country through 18 March.[11] According to President Santokhi, flooding will be a recurring problem. He wants plans to set up higher-lying areas in a way that could provide emergency relief in the event of flooding. The Falawatra plan, introduced during the 2006 floods, was also brought back for consideration in 2022.[17] The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) dispatched a two-member team on 31 May to assess flooding damage.  Its partner donors had pledged to assist Suriname a week prior after a declaration from President Santokhi.[18]"

        "content": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Waka (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 03F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 07P) was one of the most destructive tropical cyclones ever to affect the nation of Tonga. Waka originated within the near-equatorial trough in mid-December 2001, although the system remained disorganized for more than a week. The storm gradually matured and attained tropical cyclone status on December 29, 2001. Subsequently, Waka underwent rapid intensification in which it attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 severe tropical cyclone (Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale) on December 31, with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). Shortly thereafter, it passed directly over Vava\u02bbu, Tonga, resulting in widespread damage. By January 1, 2002, the cyclone began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition. The remnants of Waka persisted for several more days and were last observed near the Southern Ocean on January 6, 2002. Although the storm affected several countries along its path, Waka left the most significant losses in Tonga, where it killed one person and wrought 104.2\u00a0million pa\u02bbanga ($51.3\u00a0million USD) in damage. Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, and much of the nation's agriculture were destroyed. Winds in excess of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly every tree on the island. In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the environment was also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population due to the lack of fruit. Following the storm, Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage. Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later retired and replaced with Wiki. According to a study by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33\u00a0years.[1]"

        "content": "In mid-December 2001, at the end of a Madden\u2013Julian oscillation pulse, twin equatorial monsoonal troughs developed in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Although warm sea surface temperatures of 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in the region favored development of a tropical cyclone, the southern trough developed substantially slower than the northern one.[2] On December 19, the southern component was classified as Tropical Depression 03F by the Fiji Meteorological Service; at this time the depression was situated just east of the Solomon Islands.[3] The northern component eventually developed into Typhoon Faxai, an extremely powerful Category 5 equivalent cyclone.[4] Unlike Faxai, the precursor to Cyclone Waka developed slowly, mainly because of moderate wind shear in the region. Moving southeastward, the system gradually became more organized.[2] On two occasions, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert; however, the agency later canceled them both times.[5] By December 27, the depression had entered a region of lesser shear, favoring significant development of the system.[2][3] The following day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07P, when the storm was situated roughly 640\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) northwest of Pago Pago, American Samoa.[6] Tracking towards the southwest in response to a mid-level ridge to the southeast, the depression quickly intensified, attaining gale-force winds on December 29. Upon doing so, it was upgraded to a tropical cyclone and given the name Waka. Shortly thereafter, the storm underwent rapid intensification;[2] roughly 24\u00a0hours after being named, Waka attained sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[7] During December 30, the center of the storm brushed Wallis Island before turning towards the southeast and accelerating due to an approaching trough from the northwest. Continuing to intensify, Waka passed directly over Niuafo'ou on December 31 with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[2] Later that day, the cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 severe tropical cyclone with ten-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46\u00a0inHg).[2] The JTWC assessed the storm to have attained similar one-minute sustained winds upon peaking; however, this was due to discrepancies between the two warning centers.[3][6] At this time, Waka displayed a well-defined, circular eye roughly 60\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) in diameter. Shortly after attaining its peak intensity, the center of Waka passed over Vava'u.[2] Continuing into the new year, Waka gradually weakened on January 1, 2002, as it entered a less favorable region for tropical cyclones. As a result, wind shear displaced convection from the center and its eyewall broke apart. Moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures, Waka began to undergo an extratropical transition, which it completed on January 2.[2] Tracking southeastward, the remnant cyclone briefly slowed over open waters before again accelerating. Over the following few days, the system gradually weakened, with sustained winds decreasing below gale-force by January 5. The storm was last noted on January 6 near the Southern Ocean, about 2,200\u00a0km (1,400\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Antarctica, at which time it had a pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (972\u00a0hPa; 28.7\u00a0inHg).[7]"

        "content": "On December 30, just a day before Waka passed through Tonga, warnings were issued for numerous islands, including parts of Fiji and Samoa. Forecasts showed the storm passing directly over the low-lying Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa as a Category\u00a03 cyclone.[10] Owing to warnings from local media,[11] all New Year's Eve celebrations were canceled as residents and tourists boarded up their homes. All airports in the region were shut down and ferry service was suspended.[12] Many residents on the small island of Niuafo'ou, about 35\u00a0km2 (14\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in size, evacuated to other islands prior to Waka's arrival.[13] When the storm was moving through the islands of Tonga at peak strength, a few islands recorded hurricane-force winds; the city of Neiafu measured the strongest winds, peaking at 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). In the southern islands, wind gusts up to 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) affected isolated areas. In the Ha\u02bbapai islands, sustained winds reached 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) and gusted to 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[14] Heavy rains also fell during Waka's passage, amounting to over 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) in Ha\u02bbapai.[15] Initial reports from Nuku\u02bbalofa on December 31 indicated severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses.[16] Following the passage of Waka, communication with Niuas and Vava'u were lost.[17] According to local reports, high winds sandblasted Neiafu and downed nearly every tree.[18] Surveys by the Red Cross revealed that roughly 200 homes in the city were severely damaged or destroyed and those left standing lost their roofs.[19] Vava'u lost roughly 90% of its crops, including essential food crops such as taro, yams and bananas. In Ha'apai, one person died from cardiac arrest brought on by the storm. Fallen trees blocked numerous roads; power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents. Severe damage also took place on Niuatoputapu where coastal homes were impacted by Waka's storm surge and several structures lost their roofs.[15] In one instance, a yacht was brought onshore by the surge and crashed into a restaurant, destroying both.[20] According to damage surveys, 13 of the country's islands sustained damage;[21] 470 homes and 6 schools were destroyed and hundreds more damaged.[22][23] Damage throughout Tonga amounted to 104.2\u00a0million pa\u02bbanga ($51.3\u00a0million USD).[24][25] In addition to infrastructural and public damage, the environment sustained catastrophic losses on Tonga. The Insular Flying Fox (Pteropus tonganus), a native species of bat, suffered great losses from Waka. Compared to pre-cyclone population levels, 79.8% (\u00b19.9%) of the species was killed across six islands. This was due to widespread destruction of their natural food source, which decreased by 85% (\u00b111.8%) following Waka. Trees across Vava'u were completely defoliated,[21] although only 6.6% were killed,[1] leaving no food for the bats. The greatest decline in bats was on Utula'aina Island at 95.7%; A'a Island sustained a complete loss of food-bearing plants. Six months after the storm, the bat population in Vava'u was still only 20% of the pre-storm level.[21]"

American Samoa also experienced heavy rains, amounting to 56.9\u00a0mm (2.24\u00a0in), and gusts up to 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph).[26] The winds downed a few trees and caused minor crop damage, with losses amounting to US$120,000.[27] Large swells affected the island for roughly a week as the storm developed and moved away from the region.[28][29] Cyclone Waka also affected Wallis and Futuna, prompting tropical cyclone watches and warnings from December 28 to 31, and later impacted Niue, prompting warnings there from December 30 to January 1.[30] On Wallis Island, one home was destroyed and 50% of the banana crop was lost.[3] A maximum of 112\u00a0mm (4.4\u00a0in) of rain fell in Hihifo during the passage of Waka.[31] A wind gust of 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph) and swells up to 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) were recorded in Wallis. Niue received more significant damage, experiencing a storm surge of up to 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) and sea spray up to 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) inland. Numerous fallen trees and power lines blocked roads and left southern areas of the island without power for roughly six hours.[3] Damage in Niue amounted to US$10,000.[26] After moving through the Tongan islands, the remnants of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft), to the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every lifeguard in Whangamat\u0101, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 people out of the water.[32] Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made.[33] Rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards.[34]"

Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with the recovery process.[38] On January 12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid.[39] An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by the storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery.[22][40] Further funds came from the United States Agency for International Development, which offered US$25,000 by mid-January.[41][42] The French Polynesian assembly in Tahiti also provided US$770,000 worth of relief supplies and aid.[43] The main industry of Tonga, tourism, was devastated by the storm as no tourists were allowed to travel to the region for at least two weeks after Waka's passage.[44] The Government of Tonga requested a total of US$39.2\u00a0million in international aid, most of which was dedicated to rehabilitation of infrastructure. Medical supplies and personnel were later deployed by the World Health Organization.[45] In early March, a relief fund based on donations was set up by the United Methodist Committee on Relief to provide US$210,000 for 30 families impacted by the storm.[46] About 180 people were given assistance in rebuilding their homes by the Church World Service later that month.[47] As food shortages became severe in April, emergency supplies were sent to the outlying Niuas islands of Tonga.[37] In May, US$5.85\u00a0million was approved for emergency funds by the World Bank to assist in infrastructural rehabilitation.[48] Vava'u suffered a tremendous decrease in agricultural exports due to Waka, dropping 86.5% from the previous year.[49] Despite substantial agricultural losses, the sector ended up expanding roughly 2% by the end of 2002 and the overall economy grew by 2.9%.[50] Owing to the severity of damage wrought by the cyclone, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Waka following its using.[51]"

        "content": " Tropical Cyclone Trina (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 01F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 06P) was a weak but destructive tropical cyclone in late 2001 which caused some of the worst flooding in the South Pacific island of Mangaia, Cook Islands, in nearly 50\u00a0years. Forming out of an upper-level low pressure system on November\u00a029 near the island of Rarotonga, or roughly 1,470\u00a0mi (2,365\u00a0km) southeast of Fiji, Trina remained practically stationary as it meandered in the same general area for over a week. Due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, the storm struggled to develop significant convection, preventing it from intensifying beyond 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). After finally succumbing to wind shear on December\u00a02, the system weakened to a tropical depression near Mangaia and dissipated several days later. As a result of the cyclone's slow movement, heavy rains impacted the same area for more than a week, resulting in severe flooding. Throughout Mangaia, nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of the livestock perished. Following an assessment of the damage, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses. Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was retired in May 2002 and replaced with Tino."

        "content": "Tropical Cyclone Trina was identified by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), on November\u00a018, 2001 as an upper-level low west of Rarotonga, an island situated roughly 2,355\u00a0km (1,465\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Fiji. Little development took place over the following ten days as the low gradually made its way to the surface.  Situated in a region of relatively low wind shear, the system acquired subtropical characteristics before deep convection formed around its center.[1] Late on November\u00a029, the FMS upgraded the low to a tropical depression and assigned it the identifier 01F.[2] However, the system later entered an area unfavorable to tropical cyclogenesis, consisting of increasing shear and marginally warm sea surface temperatures, estimated between 26 and 27\u00a0\u00b0C (79 and 81\u00a0\u00b0F). Drifting westward, convection managed to increase despite unfavorable conditions, as the low passed roughly 45\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) southwest of Rarotonga on November\u00a030.[1] Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, stating a \"good\" chance of the system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48\u00a0hours. Although the center remained partially devoid of convective activity,[3] the system was declared Tropical Depression 06P by the agency within hours of the alert.[4] Later on November\u00a030, the depression further intensified into a tropical cyclone and was given the name Trina by the FMS. At this time, gale-force winds were only present in one quadrant of the storm. In previous years, gale-force winds had to be present all around the center for the system to receive a name. Upon receiving its name, Trina attained its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) along with a barometric pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.38\u00a0inHg).[1][5] Remaining nearly stationary, Trina succumbed to strong wind shear during the evening of November\u00a030.[1] The JTWC only classified Trina as a tropical storm for 12\u00a0hours before downgrading the system and issuing their final advisory early on December\u00a01.[3][4] However, according to the FMS, the system retained gale-force winds through December\u00a02, by which time it was situated about 70\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) northwest of Mangaia. Now significantly displaced from any convective activity, the remnants of Trina persisted in the same general area for several more days before completely dissipating.[1]"

Several of the islands' main roads were washed out and a few reports of landslides were made.[7] The flooding on Mangaia was regarded as the worst in almost 50\u00a0years, as nearly the entire island was affected. According to locals, the ocean surrounding the island became red at one point due to the amount of soil being washed out to sea.[10] Despite initial reports that the local water supply was contaminated, the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that it was safe to drink and there was a sufficient amount for all of the islands' 744 residents.[9] Offshore, a sailboat was severely damaged by large swells produced by the storm and was on the verge of sinking. The sailor managed to secure the vessel and make it safely to shore.[11] The flooding on Mangaia persisted for nearly a week before finally subsiding. Once the waters receded, the full extent of damage was revealed. Although only minor structural damage was sustained, the agricultural sector received extensive losses. Nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of all the livestock perished. Following an assessment made by the Cook Islands National Disaster Management Council, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses from Trina. International assistance from the United Nations was eventually requested on December\u00a012, allowing for relief funds from several agencies to be delivered to the area. Fears of food shortages also prompted the local government to begin stockpiling food should it become a necessary relief supply.[12] A total of US$24,140 was committed in relief funds by New Zealand, Norway and the United Nations to assist the Cook Islands in recovering from the storm.[13] By late-December, an additional F$20,000 (US$11,000) was distributed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to the affected islands.[14] In the months following Cyclone Trina, debris removal and cleanup was relatively slow, delaying efforts to replant crops lost in the floods. Food shortage issues became apparent in February 2002, prompting the IFRC to distribute food to all of Mangaia's residents.[15] Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was later retired.[16]"

Bridges were also damaged or destroyed, and the infrastructure of multiple towns were significantly affected. Experts have stated that urbanization and climate change in Turkey have made the floods' worse, although to what extent each factor was responsible has been disputed. As a response to the floods, the government started a disaster relief campaign, which has faced criticism for using donations instead of taxpayer money. Affected provinces were made disaster areas, and financial help was given to those affected. There have been numerous claims of a hydroelectric power plant malfunction during the flood, which the government has denied. Others have claimed that the public was misled by officials before the event, and that the missing count was an undercount; however, neither of these claims have been confirmed."

The second named storm of the very active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Bertha originated from a trough in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) only anticipated slight development as the trough moved over southern Florida, bringing torrential rainfall. The system rapidly organized on May\u00a027 after it emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean, developing a small, well-defined circulation. That day, the disturbance developed into Tropical Storm Bertha east of Georgia, and a few hours later it moved ashore near Isle of Palms, South Carolina with peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on May\u00a028 over West Virginia. The storm and its precursor disturbance caused heavy rainfall and flash flooding in southern Florida, as well as spawning a brief tornado. In South Carolina, Bertha produced above normal tides and locally heavy rainfall, causing minor flooding. As the storm moved into North Carolina, its remnants produced a brief tornado, while rip currents resulted in several water rescues in Surf City. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, Bertha caused $130,000 (2020 USD) in damage."

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the system in a special tropical weather outlook on May\u00a025, assessing a 20% chance for tropical cyclogenesis, due to expected strong wind shear, the proximity to land, and dry air.[2] By that time, the trough extended across southern Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean, producing a widespread area of thunderstorms.[3] A weak surface low formed near Orlando, Florida early on May\u00a026, which moved northeast over water by early the following day. Subsequently, the NHC increased the system's development potential to 30%.[4] Early on May\u00a027, the system developed a well-defined center underneath an area of organized thunderstorms. In addition, an offshore buoy recorded tropical storm-force winds.[5] The NHC estimated that the system developed into Tropical Storm Bertha at 06:00\u00a0UTC that day while located about 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km) east of Savannah, Georgia.[1] Operationally, it was not until 12:30 UTC that the NHC had initiated advisories on Bertha.[6] The storm had characteristics of both a tropical and a subtropical cyclone, but the NHC designated it as tropical due to the storm's small radius of maximum winds.[1] Upon its formation, Bertha was moving northwestward around the western side of a ridge over the western Atlantic.[6] At 12:00 UTC, the storm had reached peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h); this was based on observations from buoys and the storm's well-defined curved rainbands near the center.[1] Its gale-force winds extended only 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) from the center.[7] At 13:00 UTC on May 27, 2020, Bertha made landfall near Isle of Palms, South Carolina while at peak intensity. The storm quickly weakened as it progressed inland, falling to tropical depression status within a few hours of moving ashore. The depression turned toward the north, moving through western North Carolina and into western Virginia. Early on May\u00a028, Bertha transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which persisted another 12\u00a0hours before dissipating over northern West Virginia.[1]"

The peak 72\u2013hour accumulation was 14.19\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm), recorded in Miami.[8][9] Rainfall rates of 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) an hour contributed to a 24-hour total of 7.4\u00a0in (190\u00a0mm) there, more than doubling the previous daily rainfall record and resulting in the city's most significant rain event in eight years.[10] The precursor disturbance spawned an EF1 tornado in Aladdin City, which produced winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and was on the ground for 4.83\u00a0mi (7.77\u00a0km). The tornado damaged trees and fences, and overturned several campers. There was also a funnel cloud in Broward County.[11] However, they were not considered to be directly associated with Bertha. Thunderstorms produced hail up to 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) in diameter near Wellington, as well as wind gusts estimated up to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[12][9] In and around Miami, the rains flooded homes and roadways, especially in close proximity to canals.[13] Some homes even reported partial roof collapses throughout Hallandale Beach and Hollywood as a result of the heavy precipitation.[14] Local police in El Portal asked that the South Florida Water Management District open floodgates to relieve flooding in those canals.[15] Floodwaters entered vehicles and buildings in Miami Beach and Hialeah, prompting several water rescues. Hialeah's mayor asked residents to remain indoors accordingly.[16][13] Days of heavy rainfall prompted local National Weather Service offices to issue flash flood warnings, and sporadic severe thunderstorms prompted additional advisories.[17] Strong wind gusts uprooted a tree onto Route A1A.[9] As the low associated with Bertha moved northeastward, it also produced minor flooding near St. Augustine due to heavy rainfall.[18] Unsettled weather related to Bertha forced the cancellation of the planned Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch on May\u00a027 from Cape Canaveral.[19] Damage across the state was estimated at $71,000.[20]"

Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina recorded water levels 1.32\u00a0ft (0.40\u00a0m) above normal, the highest tides related to the storm. Bertha also dropped rainfall across South Carolina, reaching 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) in some locations.

During the next day, the depression turned towards the southeast and moved into a more favorable environment for intensification.[1] It was then designated as Tropical Depression 11P at 1800 UTC by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).[3] On February 11, the system significantly organized,[1] and at 1200 UTC that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale; it was assigned the name Vaianu.[4] At the time of being upgraded to a cyclone, Vaianu was situated about 190\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) to the northwest of Vava\u02bbu, a Tonga island chain.[4] The storm turned southwestward under the steering currents of a ridge to the southeast.[1] The JTWC recognized the system as a tropical storm on February 12, and upgraded it into a tropical cyclone shortly thereafter.[3] Vaianu continued to strengthen, and passed west of Tonga.[1] The JTWC reported that the cyclone peaked in intensity at 1200 UTC on February 13, with maximum sustained 1-minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[3] RSMC Nadi assessed the storm as having peaked slightly later, with 10-minute winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph), which made it a Category\u00a03 severe tropical cyclone.[4] The storm held its strength for some time as it moved southward between Ono-i-Lau and Tongatapu. Beginning to accelerate, Vaianu entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand.[4] It curved southeastward and slowly deteriorated due to increasing wind shear and colder sea surface temperatures.[1] The JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm on February 15,[3] and by the next day it was undergoing extratropical transition.[1] At 0600 UTC, the JTWC classified it as extratropical,[3] but it remained a powerful storm system for several days as it tracked over the open ocean.[1]"

Barometric pressure there fell to 995 millibars at 1400 UTC on February 13, and 97.7\u00a0mm (3.85\u00a0in) of rain fell.[10] Since the cyclone remained predominantly over water, its effects were limited. Nonetheless, portions of Tongan experienced torrential rainfall and high winds. On Tongatapu and Eua, the storm inflicted extensive crop damage, and it is estimated that 70% of the banana crop was destroyed. While little property damage took place, the storm caused power outages across its path that took up a week to fully restore.[1]  In Nuku'alofa, the capital of Tonga, flooding of low-lying areas reportedly shut down the city for two days.[1] The high winds brought down trees and dispersed debris throughout the region, while schools were forced to close.[11]"

Forming out of a tropical depression on January\u00a06, the storm gradually intensified, becoming a tropical cyclone on January\u00a012 and receiving the name Tam. Although it was traveling at a quick pace, the storm gained organization and reached its peak intensity with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) the following day. However, the increasing forward motion of the storm, combined with strengthening wind shear, caused Tam to rapidly weaken on January\u00a014. Around that time, it entered the  Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand's area of responsibility. Shortly thereafter, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated early the next day. Cyclone Tam produced heavy rainfall and strong winds over American Samoa upon being named. The precipitation caused several mudslides and flooding, which inflicted $26,000 in damage. The storm also had minor effects on Niue, Tonga, and Futuna."

        "content": "Tropical Cyclone Tam originated out of tropical depression while located about 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) to the north-northeast of Fiji on January\u00a06.[1] The system, designated 04F by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji tracked slowly towards the west.[2] Although the depression was located within an area of low wind shear, little intensification occurred, as a lack of low-level moisture hindered the development of deep convection.[1] By January\u00a09, shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the disturbance increased as it began to interact with the South Pacific Convergence Zone. Another tropical depression, 05F, also became increasingly organized and at one point was forecast to absorb 04F. Following the weakening of Tropical Depression 05F, 04F intensified.[1] Around 2000\u00a0UTC on January\u00a011, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as deep convection persisted around the center of circulation for several hours.[3] The following day, the RSMC Nadi upgraded Tropical Depression 04F to a tropical cyclone and gave it the name Tam, making it the first named storm of the 2005\u201306 season. Several hours later, the storm passed close to Niuafo'ou with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[2] By 0000\u00a0UTC on January\u00a013, the JTWC classified Tam as Tropical Cyclone 06P. Although the storm was tracking towards an area with stronger winds aloft, it was forecast to intensify.[3] Due to the relatively fast movement of the storm, the increasing winds aloft had little effect on the storm,[1] allowing it to intensify and attain winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) around 0600\u00a0UTC.[2] However, with both wind shear and the forward motion of the storm continuing to increase, convection rapidly became dislocated from the center.[3] Around 0000\u00a0UTC on January\u00a014, Tam entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand.[2] With forward movement estimated at 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) almost due south,[3] the cyclone reached an unusually high latitude as a tropical cyclone. Coinciding with the time when Tam reached 33\u00b0S, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the storm persisted for several hours before dissipating early on January\u00a015.[1]"

Only a few flights took off before officials closed the airport, stranding numerous passengers.[4] Late on January 11, RSMC Nadi placed Tonga and Futuna under a tropical cyclone alert and also placed Tonga and Wallis under a strong wind warning.[5][6] Early the next day RSMC Nadi placed northern Tonga under a tropical cyclone gale warning.[7] Later that morning they canceled the tropical cyclone alert for Wallis and Futuna as Tam was not expected to directly affect Futuna anymore.[7] During that afternoon RSMC Nadi placed Niue under a Tropical cyclone alert, as they predicted that Niue would be affected by Tam within 24 hours.[7][8] Early on January 13 RSMC Nadi cancelled the tropical cyclone warnings and alerts for Tonga, whilst at the same time placing Niue under a tropical cyclone gale warning, however this gale warning was canceled later that day as Tam moved into the southern ocean.[9] On January\u00a011, Tropical Depression 04F produced a record 293.2\u00a0mm (11.54\u00a0in) of rain in a 24\u2011hour span on Rotuma. However, little damage resulted from the heavy precipitation.[10] Cyclone Tam produced heavy rainfall in American Samoa which triggered damaging floods. Several buildings were flooded, and an estimated 70% of the island's crops were destroyed. Sustained winds of up to 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph), with gusts reaching 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph), tore a few roofs off unsecured homes.[11] Scattered power outages were reported throughout the island.[4] A few landslides were also reported as a result of the storm. Damage from the storm totaled $26,000 on the island.[11] Relatively little damage was recorded in Futuna; there, the storm downed several trees and stranded a yacht on a reef.[12] On Niuafo'ou, a weather station recorded sustained winds of 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) with gusts of up to 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph), along with a minimum pressure of 991\u00a0hPa (mbar).[13] Minor damage, consisting of fallen branches and isolated power outages also occurred on Niue.[1]"

During the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service, Australian Bureau of Meteorology and New Zealand's MetService. The United States Armed Forces through the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. The FMS attaches a number and an F suffix to systems that are active in the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. The BoM, FMS and MetService all use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale and estimate winds with a 10-minute period, while the JTWC estimates winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS)."

These outlooks took into account a variety of factors such as a developing El Ni\u00f1o event and what had happened in previous seasons such as 1972\u201373, 1982\u201383, 1987\u201388, 1991\u201392, 1997\u201398, 2002\u201303, 2004\u201305, 2009\u201310 and 2015\u201316.[1][5] The first two of these outlooks were issued in July and August by the ACWCL who suggested that it would be a near-normal season, with eight and eleven tropical cyclones occurring between 135\u00b0E and 120\u00b0W during the season.[3] The ACWCL tweaked its forecast during September and suggested that up to fourteen tropical cyclones would occur between 135\u00b0E and 120\u00b0W during the season.[3] They subsequently joined NIWA, the FMS, BoM, MetService and various other Pacific meteorological services and contributed towards the Southwest Pacific tropical cyclone outlook.[5] This outlook suggested that between nine and fourteen tropical cyclones would occur between 135\u00b0E and 120\u00b0W.[5] Four to eight of these tropical cyclones were expected to intensify and become either a Category three, four or five severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.[5] In addition to contributing towards the Southwest Pacific tropical cyclone outlook, the FMS and the BoM issued their own seasonal forecasts for the South Pacific region.[1][6] The BoM issued two seasonal forecasts for the Southern Pacific Ocean, for their self-defined eastern and western regions of the South Pacific Ocean.[6] They predicted that the Western region between 142.5\u00b0E and 165\u00b0E, had a 32% chance of seeing activity above its average of 4 tropical cyclones.[6] The BoM also predicted that the Eastern Region between 165\u00b0E and 120\u00b0W, had a 60% chance of seeing activity above its average of 6 tropical cyclones.[6] Within their outlook the FMS predicted that between eight and fourteen tropical cyclones would occur within the basin compared to an average of around 7.[1] At least five of these tropical cyclones were expected to intensify further and become either a Category three, four or five severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale.[1] The FMS also predicted that the majority of systems would occur to the east of the International Dateline, with 4-6 tropical cyclones expected to occur between 160\u00b0E\u00a0- 180\u00b0 while 6-9 were expected to occur between 180\u00b0\u00a0- 120\u00b0W.[1] On October 21, the ACWCL issued their final outlook for the season and predicted that it would be an above average season with 9-14 tropical cyclones occurring between 135\u00b0E and 120\u00b0W.[4]"

In November, Cyclone Mal would form, peak as a severe tropical cyclone, and impact Fiji before dissipating. On December 2, the precursor disturbance to Cyclone Jasper would form before entering the Australian region a day later. After a significant lull in activity, Tropical Disturbance 04F formed on January 25. After dissipating two days later, Tropical Low 06U entered the basin from the Australian region on February 2 and was designated as Tropical Disturbance 05F. After briefly exiting the basin, on February 7, it re-entered the Australian region, becoming a tropical depression. After that, Nat formed along with Tropical Disturbance 07F and Tropical Cyclone Osai. After that, Tropical Disturbance 09F formed along with Tropical Depression 10F and Tropical Disturbance 11F.

At least 10,000 households were affected by the storm.

Hot towers also rose around the center of the storm, a sign of consolidation.[28] On November 14, it intensified into a Category 2 tropical cyclone.[29] As the storm continued to move southeast by the southwest edge of a subtropical ridge, Mal strengthened into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC of the same day.[30] On November 15, it began to weaken as it entered an environment of high wind shear.[31] It later entered the New Zealand MetService's area of responsibility, where it was reclassified as an ex-tropical cyclone.[32] On November 12, a gale alert was issued for the Yasawa and Mamanuca groups as well as the western and northern regions of Viti Levu.[33] The FMS anticipated the system to become a Tropical Cyclone by November 13.[34] Nevertheless, the National Disaster Management Office of Fiji (NDMO) issued a tropical cyclone alert and citizens were urged to exercise caution.[35] Mal poured heavy rain upon the Western Division of Fiji and induced power outages in Nadi.[36] As powerlines and trees were knocked down by TC Mal across the nation, the Fiji NDMO advised the public to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel while recovery efforts were underway.[37] The cyclone's impact on Fiji was minimal with the NDMO reporting no casualties or injuries reported.

Massive areas of land bearing thick shrubbery and wildlife were burnt into a \"carpet of white ash\" with pieces of debris rising and falling around the affected areas. The intensity and range of the wildfires were exacerbated by strong winds blowing at up to 40 km per hour.[7] The prominent fires threatened many of the natural fauna including anteaters, jaguars, tapirs, caimans, and anacondas. A total of 3,538 wildfires were recorded in the region up to 1 July, up 40% compared to 2020, the year with the most wildfires in the region. Efforts to extinguish the fires were complicated by high winds and the terrain of the wetlands making access and movement difficult.[2][3] The smoke from the wildfires caused several hospitals in Corumb\u00e1 to fill with victims of smoke inhalation and respiratory symptoms, affecting children <5 years old) and senior citizens over 65 the worst. Animal rescue workers reported hundreds of animals were killed due to smoke inhalation and burns, which included frogs, snakes, monkeys, and jaguars.[7] On 31 August, IBAMA fined two companies  more than R$ 100 million for a massive fire in the Pantanal caused by maintenance workers on a railway line in Corumb\u00e1.

The fire was not completely out and their return was on the understanding that they might be required to leave again at short notice.[11] With the state of emergency lifted, work was continuing on 28 February to put out the fire completely, which it was feared might take weeks or months with conditions \"bone dry\".[12] On 6 March 2019, Nelson Tasman Emergency Management Group posted a notification that the Pigeon Valley fire was \"controlled\" and residents were no longer required to be ready to evacuate. The emergency management group defined a controlled fire as \"one that is extinguished around the perimeter and is not moving...[with] a 100 metre cold zone.\"[13]"

In Dujiangyan, Sichuan 37 inches (94\u00a0cm) of rain fell from 8\u20139 July, the heaviest rainfall since records began in 1954.[2] The rainfall led to widespread coding that destroyed bridges and houses, as well as a memorial for victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The rain also triggered multiple landslides that buried dozens of people.[3] Mountainous regions of Sichuan suffered the most damage. Qushan, the former county seat of Beichuan which was depopulated after the 2008 earthquake, was submerged in 23 feet (7.0\u00a0m) of water. The site had been designated as a memorial to earthquake victims and was home to the Beichuan Earthquake Museum. On 9 July, a bridge across the Tongkou River failed, sending six cars into the rushing waters. At least twelve people went missing as a result and are presumed dead.[3] The bridge had only returned to service a few days earlier after undergoing repairs for earthquake damage. Flood waters in the area were measured at 6,600 cubic metres per second (230,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), the highest recorded flow rate since records began in 1954.[4] Two other bridges collapsed in Sichuan with no reported injuries.[citation needed] In Dujiangyan City, Sichuan a landslide buried 11 homes and numerous vacation cottages on 10 July.[2][3] At least 18 people were killed by the landslide which covered 2 square kilometres (0.77\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and 117 were missing as of early 11 July.[2][4] Phone lines were cut, so survivors had to hike to nearby government offices for help.[2] Later on 10 July, additional landslides trapped roughly 2000 people in a tunnel between Dujiangyan and Wenchuan. All were rescued by the evening.[citation needed] In Aba, three people were killed and 12 others went missing after a mudslide in the area.[2] Across Sichuan more than 220,000 people were evacuated due to the storms and roughly 300 dings were destroyed by the floods[2][5] As of 11 July, there were 31 confirmed deaths in Sichuan and 166 people missing.[2] In Suijiang, Yunnan, four people were killed by the floods.[citation needed] The storms destroyed 5,280 homes in the province and led to the suspension of school in rural areas.[5] In Shouyang, Shanxi, twelve workers were killed when an unfinished mining building collapsed on 9 July.[3] Outside Beijing, three people drowned in a car. Deaths were also reported within the city, in Inner Mongolia, and in Gansu.[2] As of 11 July, the storms had killed 46 people in total, according to official statistics, with hundreds more missing.[2] A further, sixty people were missing in Sichuan.[4]"

        "content": " The 2019 Townsville flood was a major flood event that occurred in the city of Townsville and surrounding areas, on the eastern coast of Queensland, Australia.[1] Townsville has endured around 20 major flooding events since colonial settlement in the 1860s, but the 2019 event was one of the worst natural disasters to ever impact the region.[2] The 2019 Townsville flood was caused by a slow-moving tropical low, situated east of Mt Isa, embedded in a stalled, but vigorously active, monsoon trough. Northerly, moisture-rich monsoonal air driven by the tropical low was encountered by coastal south-easterly winds, creating a convergence zone of unstable weather. The net result of the two opposing air masses was then driven westwards over the mainland.[3] The system persisted for approximately one week with little deviation or movement, producing consistent medium to heavy rainfall over the affected areas, with isolated very heavy showers and locally damaging winds. Major to historic flooding occurred across the Townsville region as a result. Two fatalities were reported after bodies were found in floodwaters [4] and a third person reported missing was never found.[5] Two additional deaths were reported on February 12 and February 26 due to melioidosis, with at least 10 more hospitalised with the bacterial infection.[6] The weather system went on to produce major flooding in northern Central Queensland, most of which was severely drought-stricken. In addition to damaged infrastructure such as train lines, as many as 500,000 cattle were estimated to have perished in the ensuing floodwaters.[7] Some Townsville suburbs, particularly Rosslea, Hermit Park, and Idalia, experienced major inundation, with pockets of intense rainfall causing dangerous flash flooding in the northern suburb of Bluewater. Record heights at the Ross River Dam forced emergency planners to fully open the dam's spillway, releasing additional water into the Ross River, further compounding the existing flooding downstream. Severe erosion was observed on the banks of the Ross River, causing structural damage to pathways and boardwalks. The rushing of water caused supporting rocks and concrete under one particular section of pathway to be eroded away, creating a dangerous hazard for pedestrians. Record spillway heights at Aplins Weir caused damage to a pedestrian bridge. Multiple agencies assisted with rescue and recovery, including State Emergency Service (SES) Queensland Government, Townsville City Council, Queensland Rural Fire Service, Australian Defence Force and Team Rubicon Australia (Now known as Disaster Relief Australia). Notably, many locals volunteered to assist emergency services, evacuating trapped residents by boat from their flooded homes. The large number of volunteers, boats, and resulting queue of helpers were later dubbed the \"tinny army\" by local media. The floods were one of Queensland's worst natural disasters, and had heavily impacted the region. Townsville has a long history of battles against the extremes of heavy flooding and long droughts.[8] Approximately 3300 homes were damaged by floodwaters, and about 1500 homes rendered uninhabitable. As many as 30,000 insurance claims were filed in the aftermath of the event, with damages estimated to be $1.243 billion AUD based on insurance losses.[9]"

Located about 1,000 miles (1,600\u00a0km) southeast of Miami, Florida, between the Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Lesser Antilles, it consists of the eponymous main island and numerous smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, and Mona. With approximately 3.2\u00a0million residents, it is divided into 78 municipalities, of which the most populous is the capital municipality of San Juan.[21] Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government,[23] though Spanish predominates.[24] Puerto Rico was settled by a succession of peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago;[25] these included the Ortoiroid, Saladoid, and Ta\u00edno. It was claimed by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 and colonization  by Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n in 1508.[21] Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers, but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries. An influx of African slaves and Spaniard settlers, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the island. Within the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain.[26][27] By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of indigenous, African, and European elements.[28][29] In 1898, following the Spanish\u2013American War, Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States.[21][30] Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, and can move freely between the island and the mainland.[31] However, Puerto Ricans who do not reside in a U.S. state are disenfranchised from federal elections[32] and generally do not pay federal income tax.[33][34][k] In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico sends a nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress, called a Resident Commissioner, and participates in presidential primaries; as it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress, which overseas it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. Congress approved a territorial constitution in 1952, allowing residents of the archipelago and island to  elect a governor in addition to a senate and house of representatives. The political status of Puerto Rico is an ongoing debate.[35][36] Beginning in the mid-20th century, the U.S. government, together with the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company, launched a series of economic projects to develop Puerto Rico into an industrial high-income economy. It is classified by the International Monetary Fund as a developed jurisdiction with an advanced, high-income economy;[37] it ranks 40th on the Human Development Index. The major sectors of Puerto Rico's economy are manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and electronics) followed by services (namely tourism and hospitality).[38]"

        "content": "Puerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port\".[21] Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen, a derivation of Borik\u00e9n, its indigenous Ta\u00edno name, which is popularly said to mean \"Land of the Valiant Lord\".[39][40][41] The terms boricua, borinque\u00f1o, and borincano are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage,[42][43] and derive from Borik\u00e9n and Borinquen respectively.[44] The island is also popularly known in Spanish as La Isla del Encanto, meaning \"the island of enchantment\".[45] Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint John the Baptist, while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico (\"Rich Port City\").[21] Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city.[l] The island's name was changed to Porto Rico by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898.[47] The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises (also Porto in Italian, French, and Portuguese). The name was changed back to Puerto Rico in 1931 by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by F\u00e9lix C\u00f3rdova D\u00e1vila.[48][m][53][54][55] The official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\"), while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.[21]"

        "header": "History",
        "content": "The history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC. At the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Ta\u00ednos. The Ta\u00edno people's numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare.[57] Located in the northeastern Caribbean, Puerto Rico formed a key part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World. The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1593, Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names. The smallest of the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico was a stepping-stone in the passage from Europe to Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the northern territories of South America. Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the Spanish\u2013American War, Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World; they served as Spain's final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents. Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. The decree was printed in Spanish, English and French in order to attract Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers. Free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church.[58] In 1898, during the Spanish\u2013American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S. The Foraker Act of 1900 established a civil government, ending rule by American generals and the Department of War.  A U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Ortega v. Lara, 202 U.S. 339, 342 (1906),[n] involving the Foraker Act and referring to the island as \"the acquired country\", soon affirmed that the U.S. Constitution applied within its territory and that any domestic Puerto Rican laws which did not conflict with it remained in force.[59] The Jones Act of 1917, which made Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens, paved the way for the drafting of Puerto Rico's Constitution and its approval by Congress and Puerto Rican voters in 1952. However, the political status of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth controlled by the U.S., remains an anomaly."

The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association.[63] 61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and 5.49% for independence.[64][failed verification] In 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 5278: PROMESA, establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rican government. This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations. In particular, the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government's constitutional power to \"make all needful rules and regulations\" regarding U.S. territories; The president would appoint all seven voting members of the board; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico's legislature, governor, and other public authorities.[65] Puerto Rico held its statehood referendum during the 3 November 2020 general elections; the ballot asked one question: \"Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?\" The results showed that 52 percent of Puerto Rico voters answered yes.[66]"

        "header": "Geography",
        "content": "Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, Mona, Desecheo, and Caja de Muertos. Of these five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round. Mona, which has played a key role in maritime history, is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.[67] There are many other even smaller islets, like Monito, located near Mona,[68] and Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan, both located on the San Juan Bay. The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra, which are connected to the main island by bridges.[69][70] The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 5,320 square miles (13,800\u00a0km2), of which 3,420\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (8,900\u00a0km2) is land and 1,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (4,900\u00a0km2) is water.[72] Puerto Rico is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island but smaller than Connecticut. The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 110\u00a0mi (180\u00a0km), and the maximum width from north to south is 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km).[73] Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles. It is 80% of the size of Jamaica,[74] just over 18% of the size of Hispaniola and 8% of the size of Cuba, the largest of the Greater Antilles.[75] The topography of the island is mostly mountainous with large flat areas in the northern and southern coasts. The main mountain range that crosses the island from east to west is called the Cordillera Central (also known as the Central Mountain Range in English). The highest elevation in Puerto Rico, Cerro de Punta 4,390 feet (1,340\u00a0m),[72] is located in this range. Another important peak is El Yunque, one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest, with an elevation of 3,494\u00a0ft (1,065\u00a0m).[76] Puerto Rico has 17 lakes, all man-made, and more than 50 rivers, most of which originate in the Cordillera Central.[77] Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south, since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions. Puerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks, overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks.[78] Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old (Jurassic) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm. Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American Plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis. These seismic events, along with landslides, represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The 1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake occurred on 11 October, 1918 and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.[79] It originated off the coast of Aguadilla, several kilometers off the northern coast, and was accompanied by a tsunami. It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses, damaging infrastructure, especially bridges. It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4\u00a0million in property damage. The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. On 7 January 2020,[80] the country experienced its largest earthquake since 1918,[81] estimated at magnitude 6.4.[82] Economic losses were estimated to be more than $3.1 billion.[83] The Puerto Rico Trench, the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic, is located about 71\u00a0mi (114\u00a0km) north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates.[84] It is 170\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) long.[85] At its deepest point, named the Milwaukee Deep, it is almost 27,600\u00a0ft (8,400\u00a0m) deep.[84] The Mona Canyon, located in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, is another prominent oceanic landform with steep walls measuring between 1.25 and 2.17 miles (2.01 and 3.49\u00a0km) in height from bottom to top.[86]"

Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near 85\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C) in lower elevations and 70\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u00a0\u00b0C) in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season, which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March. The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances. The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects, adding to the climatic variation. Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas. Between the dry and wet seasons, there is a temperature change of around 6\u00a0\u00b0F (3.3\u00a0\u00b0C). This change is due mainly to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal water temperatures during the year are about 75\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C) in February and 85\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C) in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was 110\u00a0\u00b0F (43\u00a0\u00b0C) at Arecibo,[87] while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40\u00a0\u00b0F (4\u00a0\u00b0C) in the mountains at Adjuntas, Aibonito, and Corozal.[88] The average yearly precipitation is 66\u00a0in (1,676\u00a0mm).[89]"

On average, a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones, which are more prevalent during periods of La Ni\u00f1a than El Ni\u00f1o.[90] A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico, on average, every five years. A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island, on average, every seven years. Since 1851, the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane (also known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane in Puerto Rico) of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane.[91] In the busy 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Puerto Rico avoided a direct hit by the Category 5 Hurricane Irma on 6 September 2017, as it passed about 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) north of Puerto Rico, but high winds caused a loss of electrical power to some one million residents. Almost 50% of hospitals were operating with power provided by generators.[92] The Category 4 Hurricane Jose, as expected, veered away from Puerto Rico.[93] A short time later, the devastating Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday, 20 September, near the Yabucoa municipality at 10:15\u00a0UTC (6:15\u00a0am local time) as a high-end Category\u00a04 hurricane with sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h), powerful rains and widespread flooding causing tremendous destruction, including the electrical grid, which would remain out for 4\u20136 months in many portions of the island.[94][95][96] In 2019, Hurricane Dorian became the third hurricane in three years to hit Puerto Rico. The recovering infrastructure from the 2017 hurricanes, as well as new governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced, were put to the test against a potential humanitarian crisis.[97][98] Tropical Storm Karen also caused impacts to Puerto Rico during 2019.[99]"

Species endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 amphibians/reptiles, recognized as of 1998. Most of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island.[107] The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coqu\u00ed, a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, from which it gets its name. Most coqu\u00ed species (13 of 17) live in the El Yunque National Forest,[108] the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. Forest Service system, located in the northeast of the island. It was previously known as the Caribbean National Forest. El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic to the island. It is also home to 50 bird species, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon. In addition to El Yunque National Forest, the Puerto Rican moist forest ecoregion is represented by protected areas such as the Maricao and Toro Negro state forests. These areas are home to endangered endemic species such as the Puerto Rican boa (Chilabothrus inornatus), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus venator), the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus brunnescens) and the elfin woods warbler (Setophaga angelae). The Northern Karst country of Puerto Rico is also home to one of the remaining rainforest tracts in the island, with the R\u00edo Abajo State Forest being the first focus for the reintroduction of the highly endangered Puerto Rican parrot outside of the Sierra de Luquillo.[109][110] In the southwest, the Gu\u00e1nica State Forest and Biosphere Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals, including 48 endangered species and 16 that are endemic to Puerto Rico, and is considered a prime example of the Puerto Rican dry forest ecoregion and the best-preserved dry forest in the Caribbean.[111] Other protected dry forests in Puerto Rico can be formed within the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge complex at the Cabo Rojo, Desecheo, Culebra and Vieques National Wildlife Refuges, and in the Caja de Muertos and Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserves.[112] Examples of endemic species found in this ecoregion are the higo chumbo (Harrisia portoricensis), the Puerto Rican crested toad (Peltophryne lemur), and the Mona ground iguana (Cyclura stejnegeri), the largest land animal native to Puerto Rico.[113] Puerto Rico has three of the seven year-long bioluminescent bays in the Caribbean: Laguna Grande in Fajardo, La Parguera in Lajas and Puerto Mosquito in Vieques. These are unique bodies of water surrounded by mangroves that are inhabited by the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense.[114][115] However, tourism, pollution, and hurricanes have highly threatened these unique ecosystems.[116]"

As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S. Constitution.[119] The government of Puerto Rico is composed of three branches. The executive is headed by the governor, currently Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia. The legislative branch consists of the bicameral Legislative Assembly, made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber; the Senate is headed by a president, currently Jos\u00e9 Luis Dalmau, while the House is headed by the speaker of the House, currently Tatito Hern\u00e1ndez.

The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, currently Maite Oronoz Rodr\u00edguez. Members of the judiciary are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Puerto Rico is represented in the U.S. Congress by a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives, the resident commissioner, currently Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez. Current congressional rules have removed the commissioner's power to vote in the Committee of the Whole, but the commissioner can vote in committee.[120] Puerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico.[121][122] Residents of Puerto Rico, including other U.S. citizens, cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, but can vote in primaries. Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state or Washington, D.C. can vote in presidential elections. Puerto Rico has eight senatorial districts, 40 representative districts, and 78 municipalities; there are no first-order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government. Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term. The municipality of San Juan is the oldest, founded in 1521;[123] the next earliest settlements are San Germ\u00e1n in 1570, Coamo in 1579, Arecibo in 1614, Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692.

        "header": "Political status",
        "content": "The nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Congress, and the United Nations.[125] Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain an unincorporated territory of the U.S., become a U.S. state, or become an independent country.[126] Constitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution.[127] Laws enacted at the federal level in the U.S. apply to Puerto Rico as well, regardless of its political status. Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Puerto Rico lacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation\", for example, the power to manage its \"external relations with other nations\", which is held by the U.S. federal government. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".[128] Puerto Ricans \"were collectively made U.S. citizens\" in 1917 as a result of the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act.[129] U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, though both major parties, Republican and Democratic, hold primary elections in Puerto Rico to choose delegates to vote on the parties' presidential candidates. Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and not a U.S. state, the U.S. Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.[119][130] Only fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans. Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and, since 1917, they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft when it has been in effect. Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, residents of Puerto Rico, contrary to a popular misconception, do pay U.S. federal taxes: customs taxes (which are subsequently returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury), import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes, social security taxes, etc. Residents pay federal payroll taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as Commonwealth of Puerto Rico income taxes. All federal employees, those who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S., and some others, such as Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military, and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico also pay federal income taxes. In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because \"the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments.\"[131][132][133][134][135][136][137] In 2009, Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury.[138] Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement. They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income, and the island receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state.[139] Also, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system.[140] Puerto Rico's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states. Thus, individuals committing a crime can only be tried in federal or territorial court, otherwise it would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.[141] In 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations. Many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico, just as in any state, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, Social Security Administration, and others. While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment. Sonia Sotomayor, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, serves as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions, including serving as U.S. ambassadors to other nations."

Stopiran also from the NPP and a member of the Republican Party of the U.S.[citation needed] The resident commissioner of Puerto Rico, the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government, including the U.S. Congress, sits in the U.S. House of Representatives, serves and votes on congressional committees, and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The current resident commissioner is Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, a Republican, elected in 2016. She received more votes than any other official elected in Puerto Rico that year.[144] Many Puerto Ricans have served as U.S. ambassadors to different nations and international organizations, such as the Organization of American States, mostly but not exclusively in Latin America. For example, Maricarmen Aponte, a Puerto Rican and now an acting assistant secretary of state, previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador.[145]"

        "content": "As it is an unincorporated U.S. territory, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the U.S. as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the U.S. as its commander-in-chief. Puerto Rico has its own National Guard, and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard. The commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico adjutant general, currently Major General Jos\u00e9 J. Reyes. The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole.\nU.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command (LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM), which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic. Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM's mission until 1999, when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as U.S. Joint Forces Command. Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of U.S. Northern Command. Both the Naval Forces Caribbean (NFC) and the Fleet Air Caribbean (FAIR) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean. With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities, the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico, except for the ships that steam by, and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan, the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base. This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300\u00a0million.[146] A branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico \u2013 known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard \u2013 which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of different U.S. states, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard \u2013 known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard \u2013 which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states. At different times in the 20th century, the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico.[147] The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) on Vieques, the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas, Fort Allen in Juana Diaz, the Army's Fort Buchanan in San Juan, the former U.S. Air Force's Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla, and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's Mu\u00f1iz Air National Guard Base in San Juan.[148] The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads, Vieques, and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government. Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities, there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico: the U.S. Army's small Ft. Buchanan (supporting local veterans and reserve units) and the PRANG (Puerto Rico Air National Guard) Mu\u00f1iz Air Base (the C-130 Fleet). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations, but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico \u2013 such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there. Puerto Ricans have participated in many U.S. military conflicts, including the American Revolution, when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez (1746\u20131786).[149] They continue to be disproportionately represented in present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.[150] The most notable example is the 65th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army, nicknamed The Borinqueneers, from the original Ta\u00edno name of the island (Borinquen). The all-Puerto Rican regiment participated in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the War on Terror; in 2014, it was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for its heroism during the Korean War. A significant number of Puerto Ricans serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, largely as National Guard members and civilian employees. The size of the overall military-related community is estimated to be 100,000, including retired personnel.[148] Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel. In addition, approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards, or the U.S. Reserve forces.[151]"

Puerto Rico is the only current U.S. jurisdiction whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English: namely, Spanish. Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English, all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts, and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.[152][original research?] Title 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the U.S. Code to U.S. territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico. After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California. Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary, several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code. The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico.[153] There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico, and someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court, and vice versa, since Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does.[141] Such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy."

According to World Bank, gross national income per capita in Puerto Rico in 2020 was $21,740.[164] Puerto Rico's economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics) followed by services (primarily finance, insurance, real estate and tourism); agriculture represents less than 1% of GNP.[165][o][p] In recent years, it has also become a popular destination for MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions), with a modern convention center district overlooking the Port of San Juan.[166] Responsibility for San Juan port inspections lies with PPQ.[167] So high is the volume of cargo traffic that between 1984\u20132000 the San Juan PPQ station recorded 7.74% of all interceptions, #4 in the country, #2 for insects and #3 for pathogens.[167] Most species are originally from South America or elsewhere in the Caribbean due to PR's position as an intermediary on the way to the mainland.[167] This is one of the worst locations for cut flowers and other plant parts \u2013 both in terms of number of problems and diversity of species \u2013 for insects in plant parts in baggage, and for pathogens in plant parts in baggage and cargo.[167] Pathogen interceptions were dramatically (17%) higher 1999\u20132000 than in 1985\u20131986.[167] Puerto Rico's geography and political status are both determining factors for its economic prosperity, primarily due to its relatively small size; lack of natural resources and subsequent dependence on imports; and vulnerability to U.S. foreign policy and trading restrictions, particularly concerning its shipping industry. Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by four quarters of economic growth, and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico. This IRS section was critical to the economy, as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time, without paying federal tax on corporate income. Puerto Rico has been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the world.[168] Academically, most of Puerto Rico's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired, have been repealed, or no longer apply to Puerto Rico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history;[q] its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power;[r] as well as its highly inefficient local government[s][t] which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout time.[u][v] Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204\u00a0billion (equivalent to 103% of GNP), and a government deficit of $2.5\u00a0billion.[174][175] By American standards, Puerto Rico is underdeveloped: It is poorer than Mississippi, the poorest state of the U.S., with 41% of its population below the poverty line.[w] However, it has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America. Puerto Rico's main trading partners are the United States, Ireland, and Japan, with most products coming from East Asia, mainly China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Puerto Rico's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation, as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials, makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate."

This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up to 10% of Puerto Rico's GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.[178] A tourism campaign was launched by Discover Puerto Rico in 2018 intended to highlight the island's culture and history, branding it distinct, and different from other Caribbean destinations.

With debt payments due, the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system.[182][183] \"Without action before April, Puerto Rico's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico\", according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also said that \"Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\"[183] Initially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by 28 January. Just before that deadline, the control board gave the Commonwealth government until 28 February to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to 31 May.[181] It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA.[184] An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rossell\u00f3 government, with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt.[185] In early August 2017, the island's financial oversight board (created by PROMESA) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees, down from the original plan of four days per month; the latter had been expected to achieve $218\u00a0million in savings. Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary. Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50\u00a0billion in unfunded pension liabilities.[186]"

Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased Puerto Rico's cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973.[x][189] Projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71B or about 70% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product. This sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade (\"junk status\") by three credit-rating agencies. In terms of financial control, almost 9.6%\u2014or about $1.5\u00a0billion\u2014of Puerto Rico's central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service.[y] Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the coming years.[needs update] For practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a \"general budget\" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico, and the \"consolidated budget\" which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget, by Puerto Rico's government-owned corporations, by revenue expected from loans, by the sale of government bonds, by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States, and by other funds. Both budgets contrast each other drastically, with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently $29B and $9.0B respectively. Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budget. The critical aspects come from the sale of bonds, which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget \u2013 a ratio that increased annually due to the government's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses. In particular, the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt, as none is self-sufficient. For example, in FY2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) reporting losses of $409M, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island) reporting losses of $272M, while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island) reported losses of $112M.[191] Losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of Puerto Rico's entire public debt today.[192] Holistically, from FY2000\u2013FY2010 Puerto Rico's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% while GDP remained stagnant.[193] This has not always provided a long-term solution. In early July 2017 for example, the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9\u00a0billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek Court protection.[194]"

While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. The household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 update. The report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level.[203] The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S.$100,000 to U.S.$214,000, while the national median home value sits at $119,600.[aa] One of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports, a practice known as cabotage.[205] Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.[205] The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success.[ab] In 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that \"repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs\" and that \"shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs\".[ac][ad] Ultimately, the report concluded that \"[the] effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain\" for both Puerto Rico and the U.S., particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the U.S.[207][208] A 2018 study by economists at Boston-based Reeve & Associates and Puerto Rico-based Estudios Tecnicos has concluded that the 1920 Jones Act has no impact on either retail prices or the cost of living on Puerto Rico.[209]"

A census conducted by royal decree on 30 September 1858, gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time: 341,015 were free colored; 300,430 were white; and 41,736 were slaves.[229] A census in 1887 found a population of around 800,000, of which 320,000 were black.[230] During the 19th century, hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia, Asturias, Galicia and the Balearic Islands and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain's former colonies in South America. Settlers from outside Spain also arrived in the islands, including from Corsica, France, Lebanon, Portugal, Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Italy. This immigration from non-Hispanic countries was the result of the Real C\u00e9dula de Gracias de 1815 (Royal Decree of Graces of 1815), which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island, provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church. Between 1960 and 1990, the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity. The 2000 United States Census included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico.

Dominicans represent 53% of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics, about 1.8% of Puerto Rico's population.[195] Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic,[233][234] and Cuba[citation needed], use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the U.S. mainland. Other major sources of recent immigrants include Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Ecuador, Spain, and Jamaica.[235][236] Additionally, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico from the U.S. mainland, majority of which are White Americans and a smaller number are Black Americans. In fact, non-hispanic people represent 1.1% and majority of them are from the U.S. mainland. Smaller numbers of U.S. citizens come from the U.S. Virgin Islands. There are also large numbers of Nuyoricans and other stateside Puerto Ricans coming back, as many Puerto Ricans engage in 'circular migration'.[237] Small numbers of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics in Puerto Rico are actually American-born migrants from the mainland U.S. and not recent immigrants. Most recent immigrants settle in and around the San Juan metropolitan area. Emigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history. Starting soon after World War\u00a0II, poverty, cheap airfares, and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the U.S. mainland, particularly to the northeastern states and nearby Florida.[238] This trend continued even as Puerto Rico's economy improved and its birth rate declined. Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of \"circular migration\", with some migrants returning to the island. In recent years, the population has declined markedly, falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% (36,000 people) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration.[239] The impact of hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017, combined with the unincorporated territory's worsening economy, led to its greatest population decline since the U.S. acquired the archipelago. According to the 2020 U.S. census, the number of Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico in the U.S. is almost twice as many as those living in Puerto Rico.[240]  As those who leave tend to be better educated than those who remain, this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico's economy. Based on 1 July 2019 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 532,095 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated.[241]"

Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law.[244] However, all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population.[245] Out of people aged five and older, 94.3% speak only Spanish at home, 5.5% speak English, and 0.2% speak other languages.[2] In Puerto Rico, public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English.[246] English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant, Puerto Rican Sign Language. The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Ta\u00edno words, as well as English words. The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands. Ta\u00edno loanwords are most often used in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena, and native musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music, and dances, particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans.[247]"

        "header": "Religion",
        "content": "Religious affiliation in Puerto Rico (2014)[248][249] Catholicism was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico, were authorized by Pope Julius\u00a0II in 1511.[250] In 1512, priests were established for the parochial churches. By 1759, there was a priest for each church.[251] One Pope, John Paul\u00a0II, visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are located at the town center, or plaza. Protestantism, which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, has reemerged under U.S. rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad, was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872.[252] It was the first non-Catholic church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas.[253][254] Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38% Roman Catholic, 28% Pentecostal, and 18% were members of independent churches, which would give a Protestant percentage of 46% if the last two populations are combined. Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people. Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants: Puerto Rico, by virtue of its long political association with the United States, is the most Protestant of Latin American countries, with a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of whom are Pentecostal. David Stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960 to 1985 for another twenty-five years Puerto Rico will become 75 percent evangelical. (Ana Adams: \"Brincando el Charco...\" in Power, Politics and Pentecostals in Latin America, Edward Cleary, ed., 1997. p.\u00a0164).[255] An Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as Catholic\" but provided no source for this information.[256] The CIA World Factbook reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other. Neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent.[257] A 2013 Pew Research survey found that only about 45% of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic, 29% as Protestant and 20% as unaffiliated with a religion. The people surveyed by Pew consisted of Puerto Ricans living in the 50 states and DC and may not be indicative of those living in the Commonwealth.[258] By 2014, a Pew Research report, with the sub-title Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region, indicated that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic, 33% were Protestant, and 8% were unaffiliated; this survey was completed between October 2013 and February 2014.[259][231] An Eastern Orthodox community, the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos / St. Spyridon's Church is located in Trujillo Alto, and serves the small Orthodox community in the area.[260] In 2017, the church entered communion with the Roman Catholic Church, becoming the first Eastern Catholic Church in Puerto Rico.[261] This affiliation accounted for under 1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report.[262] There are two Eastern Orthodox Churches in the territory; the Russian Orthodox Mission Saint John Climacus in San German and the Saint George Antiochian Orthodox Church in Carolina. Both have services in English and Spanish.[263][264]There is a small Syriac Orthodox church in Aguada which is also the only Oriental Orthodox in the Island and serves a small growing community in the area. In 1940, Juanita Garc\u00eda Peraza founded the Mita Congregation, the first religion of Puerto Rican origin.[265] Ta\u00edno religious practices have been rediscovered/reinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates.[266] Similarly, some aspects of African religious traditions have been kept by some adherents. African slaves brought and maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples; in particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santer\u00eda or If\u00e1, and the Kongo-derived Palo Mayombe. Some aspects were absorbed into syncretic Christianity. In 1952, a handful of American Jews established the island's first synagogue; this religion accounts for under 1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report.[267][268] The synagogue, called Sha'are Zedeck, hired its first rabbi in 1954.[269] Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, numbering 3000 people,[270] and is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements all are represented.[269][271] In 2007, there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population.[272][273] Eight mosques are located throughout the island, with most Muslims living in R\u00edo Piedras and Caguas; most Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent.[274][275] There is also a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community.[276] In 2023, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated a temple in San Juan,[277] and reported having a membership of approximately 23,000 in the commonwealth.[278] In 2015, the 25,832 Jehovah's Witnesses represented about 0.70% of the population, with 324 congregations.[279] Buddhism in Puerto Rico is represented with Nichiren, Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, with the New York Padmasambhava Buddhist Center for example having a branch in San Juan.[280] There are several atheist activist and educational organizations, and an atheistic parody religion called the Pastafarian Church of Puerto Rico.[281] An ISKCON temple in Gurabo is devoted to Krishna, with two preaching centers in the San Juan metropolitan area."

The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language, literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.[282] Education in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels\u2014Primary (elementary school grades 1\u20136), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7\u201312), and Higher Level (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and 94.4% for females.[283] According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor's degree or higher. Instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18. As of 2010[update], there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.[284] The largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico (UPR) with 11 campuses. The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo, Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este. Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University, the Pontifical Catholic University, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Puerto Rico, and the Universidad del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n.

Many Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades. From the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English-language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On 12 March 1903, the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal Industrial\", a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years earlier. Much of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms. Early in the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable. The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico.[287][288] Puerto Rico has many symbols, but only the Flor de Maga has been made official by the Government of Puerto Rico.[289] Other popular, traditional, or unofficial symbols of Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican spindalis, the kapok tree, the coqu\u00ed frog, the j\u00edbaro, the Ta\u00edno Indian, and Cerro Las Tetas with its j\u00edbaro culture monument.[290][291]"

Spanish colonial architecture, Ibero-Islamic, art deco, post-modern, and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions. Old San Juan is one of the two barrios, in addition to Santurce, that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951, at which time the former independent municipality of R\u00edo Piedras was annexed. With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air caf\u00e9s, restaurants, gracious homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism. The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San Jos\u00e9 Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico, the Colegio de P\u00e1rvulos, built in 1865. The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts, such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro, Fort San Crist\u00f3bal, and El Palacio de Santa Catalina, also known as La Fortaleza, acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the governor of Puerto Rico. Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site. During the 1940s, sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair, and many renovation plans were suggested. There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a \"small Manhattan\". Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared as a historic building, and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas, particularly Havana, Lima and Cartagena de Indias. Ponce Creole is a unique architectural style created in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of France, Spain and the Caribbean vernacular to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico's Caribbean Sea coast.[292] It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian.[293]"

        "content": "Puerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background. A form of folk art, called santos evolved from the Catholic Church's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity. Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors. Santos vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special place on household altars, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection. Also popular, caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals. Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented. True to their historic origins, Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs. While usually constructed of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well. Red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns."

Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government. Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write. Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition and in 1647 wrote Descripci\u00f3n de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico (\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\"). This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.[295] Some of Puerto Rico's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero. Among these was Manuel A. Alonso, the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance. In 1849 he published El G\u00edbaro, a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer. Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos wrote La peregrinaci\u00f3n de Bayo\u00e1n in 1863, which used Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas as a springboard to reflect on Caribbean identity. After this first novel, Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change. In the late 19th century, with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters, Puerto Rican literature began to flourish. The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists. Alejandro Tapia y Rivera, also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature, ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of The Historical Library of Puerto Rico. Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer. His work The Indo-Antillano Vocabulary is valuable in understanding the way the Ta\u00ednos lived. Manuel Zeno Gand\u00eda in 1894 wrote La Charca and talked about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. Antonio S. Pedreira, described in his work Insularismo the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion. With the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s, Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement. Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish, and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors, journalists, poets, novelists, playwrights, essayists, and screenwriters. The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the U.S. and the rest of the world. Over the past fifty years, significant writers include Ed Vega (Omaha Bigelow), Miguel Pi\u00f1ero (Short Eyes), Piri Thomas (Down These Mean Streets), Giannina Braschi (Yo-Yo Boing!), Rosario Ferrer (Eccentric Neighborhoods). and Esmeralda Santiago (When I was Puerto Rican).[296][297]"

Puerto Rico has some national instruments, like the cuatro (Spanish for \"four\"). The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the \"Jibaro\" or people from the mountains. Originally, the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings, hence its name, but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings. It is easily confused with a guitar, even by locals. When held upright, from right to left, the strings are G, D, A, E, B. In the realm of classical music, the island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarm\u00f3nica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, drawing in classical musicians from around the world.

The majority of the state is experiencing extreme to exceptional drought conditions as part of a broader severe drought in the North American west, fueled by climate change.[5] A reduced 2021-2022 winter snowpack, long periods of higher-than-normal temperatures, and sustained strong winds have resulted in extreme fire conditions and a number of major incidents.[6][7][4] The season has seen a large number of significant wildfires.[8] In early April 2022, the McBride Fire destroyed over 200 structures and killed two people. Since April 2022, the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire grew to become the largest fire in New Mexico history.[9] It destroyed over 900 structures. Starting in May the Black Fire (2022), and ending in late July, burned in the Gila National Forest northeast of Silver City. The fire consumed some 325,000 acres and became the second-largest wildfire in state history. [10] Thousands of state residents were forced to evacuate for extended periods of times, and the fires produced smoke plumes with severe effects on air quality and health throughout New Mexico.[11]"

        "content": "The Simlipal Biosphere Reserve is located in the Indian state of Odisha and encompasses several state and national wildlife parks and sanctuaries, including the Simlipal National Park, the Hadgarh Wildlife Sanctuary and Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary, as well as buffer zones of forested areas including the adjoining Nato and Satkoshia Tiger Reserve and forest.[1] The Biosphere was declared as such in 1994 by the Indian Government, and in 2009, UNESCO recognized the Simlipal Biosphere Reserve as part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, which are areas designated for balanced relationships between people and nature. Following this, the Regional Plant Resource Centre in Odisha launched a project to identify and catalogue the varieties of flora and fauna in the reserve.[2][3][4] The Reserve is home to a vast number of rare and endangered species of flora and fauna, including forests of sal trees, 93 varieties of orchids and 52 species of endangered flora, as well as the Royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), the gaur, or Indian bison, the Asiatic Elephant (Elephas maximus), several varieties of wild cats, including the fishing cat, jungle cat, and leopard cat; the four-horned antelope or chowsingha, and many rare birds, including the red-breasted falconet, grey-headed fishing eagle, slender billed scimitar babbler, white eared bulbul, east-Himalayan long-tailed minivet and common sand piper.[1] Documentation of endemic species within the Biosphere is not yet complete and is ongoing, and in 2019, researchers discovered a tenth species of vine snake, which added to the existing documentation of nine species of vine snakes after a gap of more than 100 years.[5] The Simlipal National Park is an area that has received funds under India's Project Tiger, aimed at tiger conservation, to ensure the maintenance of viable Bengal tiger populations in the reserve.[6] In addition, the Simlipal Biosphere Reserve is home to several villages and populations of native and aboriginal tribes from India, including the Erenga Kharia people and the Mankidia people, who live in villages within the reserve and practice traditional harvesting activities for subsistence in the reserve, including collecting wild honey, gum, arrowroot, wild mushrooms, tree bark, flowers and seeds.[3] Several communities inside the reserve have been granted community forest rights under Indian law, which grants them protections to \"...protect, manage, regenerate or conserve any traditional community forest resource which they have been traditionally protecting and conserving for sustainable use.\"[7]  However, communities have previously reported difficulties in exercising these rights, and in 2017, many were subject to forcible relocations outside the reserve, resulting in damage to traditional lifestyles, cultures, and occupations.[6][8][9] In 2018, the Mankidia people, designated a 'particularly vulnerable tribe' by the Odisha government, were denied permission to continue living in their ancestral homes within the biosphere reserve.[10] Poaching has been an ongoing problem within the reserve and the Odisha state government has attempted to launch a program that attempts to recruit former poachers to act as conservationists, training them to work with the Odisha State Forest Department.[11][12]  In 2018, a fire suspected to have been caused by poachers, damaged large parts of the Simlipal National Park.[13] In addition the construction of highways inside the Simlipal Biosphere Reserve has threatened endemic species and biodiversity.[14] A previous major forest fire occurred in 2015.[15][16] The state of Odisha has one of the highest rates of forest fire incidents in India.[17] Fires are also a recurrent natural phenomenon in the reserve and are usually brought under control by rainfall that commonly occurs in the region in January and February.[18] The Odisha Forest Department has also stated many fires are caused by humans, either by indigenous tribes engaging in traditional ground-clearing methods, or by poachers who attempt to trap animals fleeing the fires.[16] To control fires, the Odisha State government is reported to have budgeted \u20b950 crore (equivalent to \u20b956\u00a0crore or US$6.7\u00a0million in 2023) and established fire squads equipped with air blowers, fire tenders and safety equipment, and instituted a toll-free number to report fires. However, the reporting network remains inaccessible to most of the indigenous communities that live within the biosphere, making reporting inconsistent.[19]"

The specific cause of the fires that occurred in early 2021 has not been yet established.[15][18] Local residents stated to The Wire that forest fires are an annual phenomenon in the region but that in 2021, the scale of fire and extent of the spread were unprecedented.[20] Since early February, officials reported more than 3400 small-scale fires in the biosphere reserve, with 350 of these occurring inside the tiger reserve.[21] Not all these fires were immediately extinguished, and in late February 2021, they began to spread rapidly at the northern and southern ends of the reserve, with wildlife authorities identifying over 300 individual fire points that were burning.[18][22] On social media, a 'Save Simlipal' campaign started by local environmental activists documented fire damage caused to the reserve.[21] By 4 March 2021, fires had been burning for over 10 days, and the Odisha state government announced a response, deploying over 1000 persons include fire and forest guards as well as 40 fire tenders and blower machines to control the fire.[18][23] Simlipal is divided into 21 'ranges' for the purpose of forest patrols and by this time, 8 of these ranges were affected by the fire.[24] Forest department officials stated that very high temperatures exacerbated the situation.[24] Access to fire points in deeply-forested areas also caused challenges in bringing the fires under control.[21] Attempts to control the fire were aided by volunteers from civil society and non-governmental organisations, who used branches and clothes to extinguish small fire points.[21] On 5 March 2021, Odisha state government officials stated that the fires had been brought under control. However, images accessed from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System showed that fires were still spreading in the biosphere reserve.[22] This was confirmed by the Forest Survey of India which had recorded 233 active forest fires in the Simlipal Biosphere Reserve as of 5 March 2021.[25] On 9 March 2021, a task force constituted by the Odisha State government confirmed that forest fires had spread to 26 out of the state's 30 districts, but that the fires were \"almost contained.\"[26] Several news sources including India Today reported that the fire had been controlled by 9 March 2021, aided in part by rainfall in the region.[27][21][28][29] However, on 14 March 2021, news channel Odisha TV reported that fires were still ongoing in parts of the biosphere reserve.[30] On 1 April 2021, the Regional Chief Conservator of Forests in Simlipal reported that fires had broken out again in 50 different places inside the Simlipal Biosphere Reserve, chiefly in the Simlipal Tiger Reserve area. Forest officials confirmed that nine persons had been arrested for poaching and intentionally causing fires.[31][32]"

In Chenzhou, which has a population of 4.6\u00a0million, it was reported that the entire city had no power or water for nearly two weeks, including government buildings and hospitals, while telecommunications cables and Internet networks were also damaged.[10] In Fuzhou, Jiangxi, it was reported that the city lost power for about 3 weeks.[1] At one point, seventeen of the thirty-one provinces and autonomous regions of China had to endure reduced power supplies. Beginning 1 February, all of Shanghai's skyline night lights were shut off to support relief efforts and were not resumed until the storm was declared officially over. In Guizhou, officials said it could take up to five months to mend the power grid fully. Xinhua reported that electricity across most of the 170 worst-hit counties was restored by the Chinese New Year.[1] Coal reserves were also down to emergency levels and stockpiles were only sufficient for eight days of power generation.[11] The snowstorm also damaged water supply equipment. For instance, in Wuhan, up to 100,000\u00a0people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. In the Guangxi region, about 239,000 were also having problems accessing drinking water.[12] Moreover, during the first week, there were significant mandatory evacuations, and an estimated 827,000\u00a0people were evacuated across fourteen provinces, affecting a total population of about 78\u00a0million. Over two weeks, according to Xinhua, 1.8\u00a0million residents were relocated elsewhere.[13][14]\nIn addition, 870,000 pigs, 450,000 sheep, and 85,000 head of cattle were killed by the storm.[8] In addition, 18,600,000 acres (75,000\u00a0km2) of forest were destroyed, including  6,800,000 acres (28,000\u00a0km2) of bamboo, 11,500,000 acres (47,000\u00a0km2) of wood, and 15,000 acres (61\u00a0km2) of saplings.[15] The freak storms were especially painful because they hit warmer parts of China that have little experience with snow. Many communities lacked the necessary equipment to handle the heavy snowfall."

Many travelers took refuge in an emergency shelter at the China Import and Export Fair exhibition center where at times the mass of people was about the size of three to four entire football fields. Goods were distributed to stranded travelers, including free water bottles and lunch boxes of rice, chicken legs, and cabbages sold at about a dollar each.[18] Red banners were installed at one station encouraging some travelers to abandon their travel plans, and nearly half a million cancelled their trips after lengthy waits. Xinhua reported that 11\u00a0million migrant workers in the Guangdong area received ticket refunds. Most of the rail service resumed on 31 January, but heavy fog on 3 February caused further delays, particularly in Hunan. The lengthy delays occasionally caused clashes between travelers, police, and soldiers.[19][20][21][22]"

According to the BBC, the country's civil affairs ministry estimated that the costs to the country's economy were about 54\u00a0billion Chinese yuan but the cost rose to 80\u00a0billion yuan as of February 7.[1][30] Damage estimates as of February 13 were at about 111\u00a0billion yuan. Insurance companies across the country received tens of thousands of compensation cases including half a million from the hardest-hit regions.[15] Analysts also mentioned that extensive loss of crops (of over 40,000\u00a0km\u00b2) including fresh vegetables and fruit resulted in substantial inflation of food prices.[27] At least 11 provinces reported significant price increases after the loss of millions of crops. The price for box lunches increased fivefold across many areas in the aftermath. During the month of January, the country's producer price index hit a three-year high with a rise of 6.1%, including a nearly 30% surge in crude prices, nearly 9% in fuel, raw materials, and power prices, and a 7 to 10% increase in diesel oil, kerosene, and gasoline prices. In addition, food prices climbed by 10% to as much as 18% during the month and significantly affected the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The inflation rate itself reached 7.1%, the highest since September 1996 when it hit 7.4%.[31][32] In addition, productivity at numerous factories was affected. Among them, steel and aluminum production was scaled back due to a significant shortage of raw materials, and a loss of production of about 50,000 tonnes of lead and zinc was forecasted in Hunan. Telecom companies had significant repair costs as about 10,000\u00a0kilometers of lines were affected. The Ministry of Information Industry mentioned that this has affected 33\u00a0million users and cost at least 80\u00a0million yuan up until 27 January. Other sectors affected were hotels, airlines, and auto sales while other businesses had a disruption in the supply of products because of transportation delays. The Chinese government mentioned that the storm would not have a significant long-term effect on the general economy but would not be without significant short-term problems.[33][34] The winter weather may have been responsible for a 7% drop in the Shanghai Composite Index due to concerns about the effects of transport breakdowns and power shortages. However, the storms happened at the same time as significant worldwide stock market volatility was occurring due to concerns of a recession in the United States. Energy-related stocks rose as much as 23% due to the rise in profits because of the weather woes.[24][33]"

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao issued an apology to citizens regarding the situation in a publicly-televised appearance at a railway station in Changsha, Hunan.[35] He mentioned that the electrical system would be the first to be fixed before restoring normal train operations for Lunar New Year holiday travelers. The severe weather also led to an emergency meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, chaired by General Secretary Hu Jintao, to discuss ways in order to control the situation.[14] About 300,000 troops and 1.1\u00a0million reservists were deployed to assist relief efforts and snow removal across various parts of affected regions.[27][28] The government also announced a $700\u00a0million (2008 USD) plan for helping farmers who had their crops destroyed by the winter weather.[25] In addition, the government spent over 330\u00a0million yuan for local disaster relief operations.[9] On 1 February, Premier Wen held a State Council meeting to discuss matters related to the snowstorms, and immediately afterward flew out to Hunan to inspect relief efforts. General Secretary and President Hu visited various coal mines to urge them to help end power shortages.[36] There were also reports that China would invest significantly in better forecasting and cooperation between weather departments in the event of future storms as there were reports of criticism of the weather agencies. According to the China Meteorological Administration, there are plans to invest nearly 2\u00a0billion yuan (US$300\u00a0million) for the improvement of the weather forecasting work, which was reportedly approved by the State Council.[37] In addition, several weather experts from the meteorological office said that the country was not properly prepared to face a winter weather event of this magnitude. Some had praised northern parts of the country for their emergency plans in unusual weather. but have criticized those from the southern parts. The Chinese Meteorological Administration also added that officials were not expecting such a lengthy episode of severe winter weather with an extensive impact across a large area.[38]"

The system was classified as T1 in the Dvorak technique, suggesting it was a tropical storm. On 19 October, these two low-pressure circulations merged to form a depression centered near  Maharashtra coast. The system intensity was classified as T2. The depression continued to intensify and moved west-northwestwards moving into the Arabian Sea. On the morning of the 20 October, the system intensified into a deep depression and was centered near 18.5\u00b0N, 70\u00b0E in Arabian Sea. The system intensity was classified as T3.5. By the noon, the deep depression had intensified into a cyclonic storm. It continued to move towards northwest. The next day it intensified in the severe cyclonic storm and moved towards north-northeast. On 22 October morning, it slightly weaken before making a landfall on  coast about 10-15 km north of Porbandar. It moved northeast and weaken into cyclonic storm by 23 October, centred near Radhanpur. By the next day noon, it had weaken into depression on 24 October near Kota in Rajasthan and then rapidly became a well-marked low-pressure area and moved northeastward before dissipating on 24 October evening near Uttar Pradesh.[1][2][3] It was the first time since 1877 that a severe cyclonic storm landed in Gujarat in October month and second since a cyclonic storm in October 1917.[2]"

        "content": " The Great Fire of 1910 (also commonly referred to as the Big Blowup, the Big Burn, or the Devil's Broom fire) was a wildfire in the Inland Northwest region of the United States that in the summer of 1910 burned three million acres (4,700 sq mi; 12,100 km2, approximately the size of Connecticut) in North Idaho and Western Montana, with extensions into Eastern Washington and Southeast British Columbia.[1] The area burned included large parts of the Bitterroot, Cabinet, Clearwater, Coeur d'Alene, Flathead, Kaniksu, Kootenai, Lewis and Clark, Lolo, and St. Joe national forests.[2] The fire burned over two days on the weekend of August 20\u201321,[3][4] after strong winds caused numerous smaller fires to combine into a firestorm of unprecedented size. It killed 87 people,[5] mostly firefighters,[6][7] destroyed numerous manmade structures, including several entire towns, and burned more than three million acres of forest with an estimated billion dollars' worth of timber lost.[2] While the exact cause of the fire is often debated, according to various U.S. Forest Service sources, the primary cause of the Big Burn was a combination of severe drought and a series of lightning storms that ignited hundreds of small fires across the Northern Rockies. However, the ignition sources also include human activity such as railroads, homesteaders, and loggers.[8] It is believed to be the largest, although not the deadliest, forest fire in U.S. history.[9][10] In the aftermath of the fire, the U.S. Forest Service received considerable recognition for its firefighting efforts, including a doubling of its budget from Congress. The outcome was to highlight firefighters as public heroes while raising public awareness of national nature conservation. The fire is often considered a significant impetus in the development of early wildfire prevention and suppression strategies.[2]"

The wildfire season started early that year because the winter of 1909\u20131910 and the spring and summer of 1910 were extremely dry,[11][2] and the summer sufficiently hot to have been described as \"like no others.\"[1] The drought resulted in forests with abundant dry fuel, in an area which had previously experienced dependable autumn and winter moisture.[12] Hundreds of fires were ignited by hot cinders flung from locomotives, sparks, lightning,[2] and backfiring crews. By mid-August, there were 1,000 to 3,000 individual fires burning in Idaho, Montana, and Washington.[9]"

The United States Forest Service (then called the National Forest Service) was only five years old at the time and unprepared for the possibilities of the dry summer or a fire of this magnitude, although throughout the summer it had been urgently recruiting as many men as possible to fight the hundreds of fires already burning, many of them with little forestry or firefighting experience.[2] Earlier in August, President William Howard Taft had authorized the addition of military troops to the effort, and 4,000 troops, including seven companies from the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry Regiment (known as the Buffalo Soldiers), were brought in to help fight the fires burning in the northern Rockies.[6][13] The arrival of the Buffalo Soldiers troops almost doubled the black population of Idaho.[2] Smoke from the fire was said to have been seen as far east as Watertown, New York, and as far south as Denver, Colorado. It was reported that, at night, five hundred miles (800\u00a0km) out into the Pacific Ocean, ships could not navigate by the stars because the sky was cloudy with smoke.[9] The extreme scorching heat of the sudden inferno has been attributed to the expansive Western white pine forests that covered much of northern Idaho at the time, due to their flammable sap.[14] The fire was finally extinguished when another cold front swept in, bringing steady rain and some early snowfall.[2][6]"

Around midnight, a man announced that he, at least, was getting out of there. Knowing that they would have no chance of survival if they ran, Pulaski drew his pistol, threatening to shoot the first person who tried to leave. In the end, all but five of the forty or so men survived.[17][18] Pulaski has since been widely celebrated as a hero for his efforts; the mine tunnel in which he and his crew sheltered from the fire, now known as the Pulaski Tunnel, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places."

That strategy was called into question after the Great Fire, but Fire Chief Henry Graves, the second Chief Forester for the Forest Service, doubled down following the Big Blow Up, calling for a more aggressive fire prevention policy. He launched a campaign to remove fire from the landscape. His efforts would lead to the creation of the Weeks Act, which called for cooperation among federal, state and private agencies to address fire protection. The Weeks Act has been credited with saving nearly 20 million acres of forestland.[27] One of the people who fought the fire, Ferdinand Silcox, went on to become the fifth chief of the Forest Service. Influenced by the devastation of the Big Blowup, Silcox promoted the \"10 a.m.\" policy, with the goal of suppressing all fires by 10 a.m. of the day following their report.[28] It was decided that the Forest Service was to prevent and battle every wildfire.[26]"

While the fire burned, record amounts of particulate matter were measured in the air.[9] As a result of the fire, flooding in the burn area increased. Consequently, many roads and bridges in the area were washed out. This included State Highway 67, the main highway that runs through the area. Other indirect destruction included sediment runoff into a reservoir that is used as a water source for Denver. The removal of this sediment cost $25 million.[9] Most of the burn area is inside of the Pike National Forest. The fire caused the closure of a large part of the national forest land as well as nearby Eleven Mile State Park and Spinney State Park. Tourism saw a sharp decline in the area and it is estimated that local businesses lost 50% of their seasonal revenues as a result of the fire-induced closures.[9]"

Barton's claim that she was attempting to burn a letter from her estranged husband was disputed by one of her teenage daughters who testified that a psychology teacher had told Ms. Barton to write her feelings in a letter and burn it.[10] The fire quickly spread out of the campfire ring and eventually torched over 138,000 acres (560\u00a0km2) and burned across four different counties. A federal grand jury indicted Barton on four felony counts of arson.[11] Barton pleaded guilty to two charges: setting fire to federal forest land and lying to investigators[12] and was given a six-year sentence in federal prison. U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch refused, however, to impose the $14 million restitution asked for by prosecutors, saying he would not sentence her to a \"life of poverty.\" Additionally, the State of Colorado sentenced Barton to 12 years in prison to run concurrently with the 6-year federal sentence. The state sentence was overturned on appeal, however, on grounds that the presiding judge had \"the appearance of prejudice\" because smoke from the fire had motivated him to voluntarily leave his home for one night.[13] In March 2008, Barton was re-sentenced by a different judge to 15 years of probation and 1,000 hours community service.[14] Several insurance companies filed a $7 million suit against the government in the fall of 2008, claiming that Barton was negligent in her duties.  In November, Judge Wiley Daniel ruled that the government was not responsible for Barton's actions because she was acting as an angry spouse and not as a government worker.[15] In August 2018, Barton's sentence was extended another 15 years in the form of unsupervised probation (the unsupervised probation was ordered to save legal fees that would then be redirected towards restitution). Judge William Brian ordered that Barton continue to make payments toward the $14.5 million in restitution she owed as of the 2018 re-sentencing. The judge also ordered that Barton get a full-time job.[16]"

Broome received 1,502 millimetres (59\u00a0in) of rainfall in the first two months of 2018, the equivalent of two years worth.[2] The rainfall was caused by Cyclone Joyce, which struck Broome on 12 January 2018. Another tropical low struck the area two weeks later, which delivered further rains.[3] Cyclone Kelvin then hit on 16 February.[2] Dampier Creek and other waterways burst their banks and inundated low-lying areas. The town became isolated when the Great Northern Highway was cut to the south and east of the town.[2] Some residents of surrounding areas had to be evacuated and supplies had to be air dropped to isolated communities.[2] An area of the Kimberley about the size of Victoria was isolated once the highway was cut. The floodwater also caused damage to around 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) of the road between Broome and Derby with another 12\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi) remaining underwater south of Broome near Roebuck Plains a week after the floods.[4]"

        "content": " Cambodia,[a] officially the Kingdom of Cambodia,[b] is a country in Mainland Southeast Asia. It borders Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the north, Vietnam to the east, and has a coastline along the Gulf of Thailand on the southwest. It spans an area of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles), and has a population of about 17 million.[15] Its capital and most populous city is Phnom Penh. In 802 AD, Jayavarman II declared himself king, uniting the warring Khmer princes of Chenla under the name \"Kambuja\".[16] This marked the beginning of the Khmer Empire. The Indianised kingdom facilitated the spread of first Hinduism and then Buddhism to Southeast Asia and undertook religious infrastructural projects throughout the region. In the 15th century, it began a decline in power (the Post-Angkor Period) until, in 1863, it became the French Protectorate of Cambodia. After the Japanese occupation of Cambodia during the Second World War, it gained independence in 1953. The Vietnam War extended into the country in 1965 via the Ho Chi Minh and Sihanouk trails. A 1970 coup installed the US-aligned Khmer Republic, which was overthrown by the Khmer Rouge in 1975. The Khmer Rouge ruled the country and carried out the Cambodian genocide from 1975 until 1979, when they were ousted in the Cambodian\u201a\u00c4\u00ecVietnamese War. The Vietnamese-occupied People's Republic of Kampuchea became the de facto government. Following the 1991 Paris Peace Accords which formally ended the war with Vietnam, Cambodia was governed by a United Nations mission (1992\u201a\u00c4\u00ec93). The UN withdrew after the 1993 Cambodian general election, decided by around 90% of registered voters. The 1997 coup d'\u221a\u00a9tat consolidated power under Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP). While constitutionally a multi-party state,[17] CPP dominates the political system and dissolved its main opposition party in 2017, making it a de facto one-party state.[18] The UN now designates it a least developed country.[19] Cambodia is a member of the United Nations, ASEAN, the RCEP, the East Asia Summit, the WTO, the Non-Aligned Movement and La Francophonie, and a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.[20][21] Agriculture remains the dominant economic sector, with growth in textiles, construction, garments, and tourism leading to increased foreign investment and international trade.[22] It is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change."

Coedes suggests that the Kambu Swayambhuva legend has its origins in southern India, as a version of the Kanchi Pallava dynasty creation myth.[25][26] Colloquially, Cambodians refer to their country as either Srok Khmer (\u00b7\u00fb\u00fc\u00b7\u00fc\u00ed\u00b7\u00fb\u00f6\u00b7\u00fb\u00aa\u00b7\u00fb\u00c4\u00b7\u00fb\u00c5\u00b7\u00fc\u00ed\u00b7\u00fb\u00f2\u00b7\u00fc\u00c7\u00b7\u00fb\u00f6 Sr\u2248\u00e8k Khm\u221a\u2122r, pronounced [srok k\u00a0\u221emae]; meaning \"Land of the Khmers\"), or the slightly more formal \u00b7\u00fb\u00ee\u00b7\u00fc\u00ed\u00b7\u00fb\u00f6\u00b7\u00fb\u00eb\u00b7\u00fc\u00c5\u00b7\u00fb\u00fc\u00b7\u00fb\u00c4\u00b7\u00fb\u00f2\u00b7\u00fc\u00ed\u00b7\u00fb\u00f1\u00b7\u00fb\u00aa\u00b7\u00fb\u00e1\u00b7\u00fb\u2202 (Pr\u221a\u00a2t\u221a\u00a9s K\u221a\u00a2mp\u2248\u2260ch\u221a\u00a9a, pronounced [pr\u2026\u00ebteh kampuci\u2026\u00f4]; \"Country of Kampuchea\").

Excavations in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon dates around 6000 BC.[30][31] Upper layers in the same site gave evidence of transition to Neolithic, containing the earliest dated earthenware ceramics in Cambodia.[32] Archaeological records for the period between the Holocene and Iron Age remain equally limited. An event in prehistory was the penetration of the first rice farmers from the north, which began in the third millennium BC.[33] Prehistoric evidence are the \"circular earthworks\" discovered in the red soils near Memot and in the adjacent region of Vietnam in the latter 1950s. Their function and age are still debated, and some of them possibly date from the second millennium BC.[34][35] Other prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are Samrong Sen (not far from the ancient capital of Oudong), where the first investigations began in 1875,[36] and Phum Snay, in the northern province of Banteay Meanchey.[37] Iron was worked by about 500 BC, with supporting evidence coming from the Khorat Plateau, in what later is Thailand. In Cambodia, some Iron Age settlements were found beneath Baksei Chamkrong and other Angkorian temples while circular earthworks were discovered at the site of Lovea kilometres north-west of Angkor. Burials testify to improvement of food availability and trade, and the existence of a social structure and labour organization.[38] Kinds of glass beads recovered from sites, such as the Phum Snay site in the northwest and the Prohear site in the southeast, suggest that there were two main trading networks at the time. The two networks were separated by time and space, which indicate that there was a shift from one network to the other at about the 2nd\u201a\u00c4\u00ec4th century AD, probably due to changes in socio-political powers.[38]"

For more than 2,000 years, what was to become Cambodia absorbed influences from India, passing them on to other Southeast Asian civilisations that later became Thailand and Laos.[39] The Khmer Empire grew out of the remnants of Chenla, becoming firmly established in 802 when Jayavarman II (reigned c.\u2009790 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec c.\u2009835) declared independence from Java and proclaimed themselves a Devaraja. They and their followers instituted the cult of the God-king and began a series of conquests that formed an empire which flourished in the area from the 9th to the 15th centuries.[40] During the rule of Jayavarman VIII the Angkor empire was attacked by the Mongol army of Kublai Khan; the king was able to buy peace.[41] Around the 13th century, Theravada missionaries from Sri Lanka reintroduced Theravada Buddhism to Southeast Asia, having sent missionaries previously in the 1190s.[42][43] The religion spread and eventually displaced Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism as the popular religion of Angkor; it was not the official state religion until 1295 when Indravarman III took power.[44] The Khmer Empire was Southeast Asia's largest empire during the 12th century. The empire's centre of power was Angkor, where a series of capitals were constructed during the empire's zenith. In 2007 an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest pre-industrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 2,980 square kilometres (1,151 square miles).[45] The city could have supported a population of up to 1 million people.[46] After a series of wars with neighbouring kingdoms, Angkor was sacked by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and abandoned in 1432 because of ecological failure and infrastructure breakdown.[47][48] The hill tribe people were \"hunted incessantly and carried off as slaves by the Siamese (Thai), the Annamites (Vietnamese), and the Cambodians\".[49][50] Formerly part of the Khmer Empire, the Mekong Delta had been controlled by the Vietnamese since 1698,[51] with King Chey Chettha II granting the Vietnamese permission to settle in the area decades before.[52]"

The throne became vacant in 1941 with the death of Monivong, Sisowath's son, and France passed over Monivong's son, Monireth, feeling he was too independently minded. Instead, Norodom Sihanouk, a maternal grandson of King Sisowath was enthroned.

Upon his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince. As the Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War. Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. In December 1967 Washington Post journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object unless Cambodians were killed.[55] The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968.[56] In public Sihanouk refuted the right of the U.S. to use air strikes in Cambodia, and on 26 March he said \"these criminal attacks must immediately and definitively stop\". On 28 March a press conference was held and Sihanouk appealed to the international media: \"I appeal to you to publicise abroad this very clear stand of Cambodia\u201a\u00c4\u00eethat is, I will, in any case, oppose all bombings on Cambodian territory under whatever pretext.\" Nevertheless, the public pleas of Sihanouk were ignored and the bombing continued.[57]"

The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, launched armed attacks on the new government. The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of civil war.[59] Khmer Rouge rebels began using him to gain support. From 1970 until 1972, the Cambodian conflict was largely between the government and army of Cambodia, and the armed forces of North Vietnam. As they gained control of Cambodian territory, the Vietnamese communists imposed a new political infrastructure, which was eventually dominated by the Cambodian communists now referred to as the Khmer Rouge.[61] Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot's then second in command, Nuon Chea.[62] NVA units overran Cambodian army positions while the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) expanded their attacks on lines of communication. In response to the North Vietnamese invasion, US President Richard Nixon announced that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see Cambodian Incursion).[63] On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days, led to the collapse of the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, 5 days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.[64]"

Hundreds of thousands fled across the border into neighbouring Thailand. The regime disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups. The Cham Muslims underwent purges with as much as half of their population exterminated.[68] Pol Pot was determined to keep his power and disenfranchise any enemies or potential threats, and thus increased his violent and aggressive actions against his people.[69] Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced the Vietnamese population in Cambodia from between 250,000 and 300,000 in 1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984.[54] Most of the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but ethnic Khmer. Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, were targeted. According to Robert D. Kaplan, \"eyeglasses were as deadly as the yellow star\" as they were seen as a sign of intellectualism.[70] Religious institutions were targeted by the Khmer Rouge.

Its arms came from Vietnam and the Soviet Union.[74] In opposition to the newly created state, a government-in-exile referred to as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) was formed in 1981 from 3 factions.[74] This consisted of the Khmer Rouge, a royalist faction led by Sihanouk, and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front. Its credentials were recognised by the United Nations. The Khmer Rouge representative to UN, Thiounn Prasith, was retained, and he had to work in consultation with representatives of the noncommunist Cambodian parties.[75][76] The refusal of Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia led to economic sanctions.[77] Peace efforts began in Paris in 1989 under the State of Cambodia, culminating 2 years later in October 1991 in a Paris Comprehensive Peace Settlement.

A power-sharing agreement was agreed with Ranariddh and Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party both simultaneously being co-Prime Ministers after the CPP threatened to secede part of the country if power was fully transferred to FUNCINPEC. The stability established following the conflict was shaken in 1997 by a coup d'\u221a\u00a9tat led by the co-Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ousted Ranariddh and other parties represented in the government and consolidated power for CPP.[79][80] After its government was able to stabilize under Sen, Cambodia was accepted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 30 April 1999.[81][82] Norodom Sihamoni was crowned Cambodia's king in 2004 after his father Sihanouk's abdication.[83] During the late 1990s and early 2000s, reconstruction efforts progressed which led to some political stability through a multiparty democracy under a constitutional monarchy[84] although Sen's rule has been marred by human rights abuses and corruption.[85] Cambodia's economy grew rapidly in the 2000s and 2010s,[86] and it received considerable investment and infrastructure development support from China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.[87] A UN-backed war crimes tribunal, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal sought out to investigate crimes committed during the Democratic Kampuchea period and prosecute its leaders. Hun Sen has opposed extensive trials or investigations of former Khmer Rouge officials.[88] In July 2010, Kang Kek Iew was the first Khmer Rouge member found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his role as the former commandant of the S21 extermination camp and he was sentenced to life in prison.[89][90] In August 2014, the tribunal sentenced Khieu Samphan, the regime's 83-year-old former head of state, and Nuon Chea, its 88-year-old chief ideologue, to life in prison on war crimes charges for their role in the country's terror period in the 1970s.[needs update] After the 2013 Cambodian general election, allegations of voter fraud from opposition party Cambodia National Rescue Party led to widespread anti-government protests that continued into the following year. The protests ended after a crackdown by government forces.[91][92] The Cambodia National Rescue Party was dissolved ahead of the 2018 Cambodian general election and the ruling Cambodian People's Party also enacted tighter curbs on mass media.[93] The CPP won every seat in the National Assembly without major opposition, effectively solidifying de facto one-party rule in the country.[94][95] The global COVID-19 pandemic spread to Cambodia in early 2020. Despite minimising the disease's spread for much of 2020[96] the country's health system was put under strain by a major outbreak in early 2021, which prompted several lockdowns.[97] It also had a severe economic impact, with the tourism industry particularly affected due to international travel restrictions.[98] Prime Minister Hun Sen assumed office 39 years ago and is one of the world's longest-serving leaders. He has been accused of crackdowns on opponents and critics. In December 2021, Hun Sen announced his support for his son Hun Manet to succeed him after the next general election in 2023.[99] In October 2022, Hun Sen warned CPP members that the country's newest and largest opposition party, the Candlelight Party, may be dissolved before the 2023 general election.[18] The warning comes after a June 2022 lawsuit filed by the National Election Committee against the party's deputy president, Son Chhay, accusing him of defamation by speaking out against electoral fraud by the CPP.[100] A July 2023 Human Rights Watch report showed numerous and significant election fraud and vote tampering in the June 2022 commune elections.[101] In the July 2023 election, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) easily won by a landslide in a flawed election, after the disqualification of Cambodia's most important opposition, Candlelight Party.[102] On 22 August 2023, Hun Manet was sworn in as the new Cambodian prime minister.[103]"

It borders Thailand to the north and west, Laos to the northeast, and Vietnam to the east and southeast. It has a 443-kilometre (275-mile) coastline along the Gulf of Thailand.[14][84] Cambodia's landscape is characterised by a low-lying central plain that is surrounded by uplands and low mountains and includes the Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and the upper reaches of the Mekong River delta. Extending outward from this central region are transitional plains, thinly forested and rising to elevations of about 650 feet (200 metres) above sea level.[citation needed] In Cambodia forest cover is around 46% of the total land area, equivalent to 8,068,370 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 11,004,790 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 7,464,400 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 603,970 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 4% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity). For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.[104][105] To the north the Cambodian plain abuts a sandstone escarpment, which forms a southward-facing cliff stretching more than 200 miles (320 kilometres) from west to east and rising abruptly above the plain to heights of 600\u00a0to 1,800 feet (180\u201a\u00c4\u00ec550 metres). This cliff marks the southern limit of the D\u221a\u00a2ngr\u221a\u2122k Mountains.[citation needed] Flowing south through Cambodia's eastern regions is the Mekong River. East of the Mekong the transitional plains gradually merge with the eastern highlands, a region of forested mountains and high plateaus that extend into Laos and Vietnam. In southwestern Cambodia two distinct upland blocks, the Kr\u221a\u00a2vanh Mountains and the D\u221a\u00a2mrei Mountains, form another highland region that covers much of the land area between the Tonle Sap and the Gulf of Thailand.[citation needed] In this remote and largely uninhabited area, Phnom Aural, Cambodia's highest peak rises to an elevation of 5,949 feet (1,813 metres).[106] The southern coastal region adjoining the Gulf of Thailand is a narrow lowland strip, heavily wooded and sparsely populated, which is isolated from the central plain by the southwestern highlands.[citation needed] The most distinctive geographical feature is the inundations of the Tonle Sap, measuring about 2,590 square kilometres (1,000 square miles) during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometres (9,500 square miles) during the rainy season. This densely populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of Cambodia.[107] Much of this area has been designated as a biosphere reserve.[107]"

        "content": "Cambodia's climate, like that of the rest of Southeast Asia, is dominated by monsoons, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences.[citation needed] Cambodia has a temperature range from 21 to 35\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC (70 to 95\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF) and experiences tropical monsoons. Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to October. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from November to April. The country experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period occurring from January to February.[citation needed] According to the International Development Research Center and The United Nations, Cambodia is considered Southeast Asia's most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change, alongside the Philippines.[108][109] Nearly all provinces in Cambodia are affected by climate change.[110] Rural coastal populations are particularly at risk. Shortages of clean water, extreme flooding, mudslides, higher sea levels and potentially destructive storms are of particular concern, according to the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance. Climate change has also had a major impact on water levels, ecology and productivity of the Tonl\u221a\u00a9 Sap in recent years, affecting the food security and agriculture of a large proportion of Cambodia's population.[111][112] Cambodia has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to October, can see temperatures drop to 22\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC (72\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF) and is generally accompanied with high humidity. The dry season lasts from November to April when temperatures can rise up to 40\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC (104\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF) around April. Disastrous flooding occurred in 2001 and again in 2002, with some degree of flooding almost every year.[113] Severe flooding also affected 17 provinces in Cambodia during the 2020 Pacific typhoon season.[114]"

There are 212 mammal species, 536 bird species, 240 reptile species, 850 freshwater fish species (Tonle Sap Lake area), and 435 marine fish species recorded by science. Much of this biodiversity is contained around the Tonle Sap Lake and the surrounding biosphere.[115] The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve is a reserve surrounding the Tonle Sap lake. It encompasses the lake and nine provinces: Kampong Thom, Siem Reap, Battambang, Pursat, Kampong Chhnang, Banteay Meanchey, Pailin, Oddar Meanchey and Preah Vihear. In 1997, it was successfully nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.[116] Other key habitats include the evergreen and dry Dipterocarp forests of Mondolkiri province, protected by Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, and Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary, as well as Ratanakiri province, and the Cardamom Mountains ecosystem, including Preah Monivong National Park, Botum-Sakor National Park, and the Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary. The Worldwide Fund for Nature recognises six distinct terrestrial ecoregions in Cambodia \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the Cardamom Mountains rain forests, Central Indochina dry forest, Southeast Indochina dry evergreen forest, Southern Annamite Range tropical forest, Tonle Sap freshwater swamp forest, and Tonle Sap-Mekong peat swamp forest.[117] The rate of deforestation in Cambodia is one of the highest in the world and it is often perceived as the most destructive, singular environmental issue in the country.[118] Cambodia's primary forest cover fell from over 70% in 1969 to just 3.1% in 2007. Since 2007, less than 3,220\u00a0km2 (1,243\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of primary forest remain with the result that the future sustainability of the forest reserves of Cambodia is under severe threat.[119][120] In 2010\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2015, the annual rate of deforestation was 1.3%. The environmental degradation also includes national parks and wildlife sanctuaries on a large scale and many endangered and endemic species are now threatened with extinction due to loss of habitats. Reasons for the deforestation in Cambodia range from opportunistic illegal loggings to large scale clearings from big construction projects and agricultural activities. The deforestation involves the local population, Cambodian businesses and authorities as well as transnational corporations from all over the world.[121][122] Plans for hydroelectric development in the Greater Mekong Subregion, by Laos in particular, pose a \"real danger to the food supply of Vietnam and Cambodia. Upstream dams will imperil the fish stocks that provide the vast majority of Cambodia's protein and could also denude the Mekong River of the silt Vietnam needs for its rice basket.\" The rich fisheries of Tonle Sap, the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, largely supply the impoverished country's protein. The lake is unusual: It all but disappears in the dry season and then expands massively as water flow from the Mekong backs up when the rains come. \"Those fish are so important for their livelihoods, both economically and nutritionally\", said Gordon Holtgrieve, a professor at the University of Washington; he points out that none of the dams that are either built or being built on the Mekong river \"are pointing at good outcomes for the fisheries\".[123] In the 2010s, the Cambodian government and educational system has increased its involvement and co-operation with both national and international environmental groups.[124][125][126] A new National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan (NESAP) for Cambodia is to be implemented from late 2016 to 2023 and contains new ideas for how to incite a green and environmentally sustainable growth for the country.[127]"

Senators serve six-year terms.[128] On 14 October 2004, King Norodom Sihamoni was selected by a special nine-member Royal Throne Council, part of a selection process that was quickly put in place after the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a week prior. Sihamoni's selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun Sen and National Assembly Speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh (the king's half-brother and current chief advisor), both members of the throne council. He was enthroned in Phnom Penh on 29 October 2004.[citation needed] Officially a multiparty democracy, in reality, \"the country remain[ed] a one-party state dominated by the Cambodian People's Party and Prime Minister Hun Sen, a recast Khmer Rouge official in power since 1985.

The 2013 election results were disputed by the opposition, leading to demonstrations in the capital. Demonstrators were injured and killed in Phnom Penh where a reported 20,000 protesters gathered, with some clashing with riot police.[132] From a humble farming background, Hun Sen was just 33 when he took power in 1985, and was by some[who?] considered a long-ruling dictator.[133] Hun Sen was succeeded by his son Hun Manet as Prime Minister in August 2023 following an election that was deemed by independent and foreign media and politicians to be neither free nor fair.[5][6][7] Hun Sen remains the de facto ruler of Cambodia through his continued leadership of the Cambodian People's Party.[134] Following the 2024 Senate election, Hun Sen became president of the Senate, a role which gives him the power to sign off on laws in the King's absence.[135] Since the 2017 crackdowns on political dissent and free press, Cambodia has been described[by whom?] as a de facto one-party state.[136][137][138]"

In 2005 Cambodia attended the inaugural East Asia Summit in Malaysia.[citation needed] Cambodia has established diplomatic relations with numerous countries; the government reports twenty embassies in the country[139] including many of its Asian neighbours and those of important players during the Paris peace negotiations, including the US, Australia, Canada, China, the European Union (EU), Japan, and Russia.[140] As a result of its international relations, various charitable organisations have assisted with social, economic, and civil infrastructure needs.[citation needed] While the violent ruptures of the 1970s and 1980s have passed, several border disputes between Cambodia and its neighbours persist. There are disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary with Vietnam and undefined maritime boundaries. Cambodia and Thailand also have border disputes, with troops clashing over land immediately adjacent to the Preah Vihear temple in particular, leading to a deterioration in relations. Most of the territory belongs to Cambodia, but a combination of Thailand disrespecting international law, Thai troops upbuild in the area and lack of resources for the Cambodian military have left the situation unsettled since 1962.[141][142] Cambodia and China have cultivated ties in the 2010s. A Chinese company with the support of the People's Liberation Army built a deep-water seaport along 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) stretch of Cambodian coastline of the Gulf of Thailand in Koh Kong province; the port is sufficiently deep to be used by cruise ships, bulk carriers or warships. Cambodia's diplomatic support has been invaluable to Beijing's effort to claim disputed areas in the South China Sea. Because Cambodia is a member of ASEAN, and because under ASEAN rules \"the objections of one member can thwart any group initiative\", Cambodia is diplomatically useful to China as a counterweight to southeast Asian nations that have closer ties to the United States.[143] Cambodia is the 70th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.[144]"

Hun Sen was a former Khmer Rouge commander who was originally installed by the Vietnamese and, after the Vietnamese left the country, maintains his strong man position by violence and oppression when deemed necessary.[147] In 1997, fearing the growing power of his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun launched a coup, using the army to purge Ranariddh and his supporters. Ranariddh was ousted and fled to Paris while other opponents of Hun Sen were arrested, tortured, and some summarily executed.[147][148] In addition to political oppression, the Cambodian government has been accused of corruption in the sale of vast areas of land to foreign investors resulting in the eviction of thousands of villagers[149] as well as taking bribes in exchange for grants to exploit Cambodia's oil wealth and mineral resources.[150] Cambodia is consistently listed as one of the most corrupt governments in the world.[151][152][153] Amnesty International currently recognises one prisoner of conscience in the country: 33-year-old land rights activist Yorm Bopha.[154] Journalists covering a protest over disputed election results in Phnom Penh on 22 September 2013 say they were deliberately attacked by police and men in plain clothes, with slingshots and stun guns.

The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reintroduced more than 750 traditional rice varieties to Cambodia from its rice seed bank in the Philippines.[170] These varieties had been collected in the 1960s.[citation needed] Based on the Economist, IMF: Annual average GDP growth for the period 2001\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2010 was 7.7% making it one of the world's top ten countries with the highest annual average GDP growth.

Between 2010 and 2012 the number of regulated banks and micro-finance institutions increased from 31 covered entities to over 70 individual institutions underlining the growth within the Cambodian banking and finance sector.[citation needed] In 2012, Credit Bureau Cambodia was established with direct regulatory oversight by the National Bank of Cambodia.[173] The Credit Bureau further increases the transparency and stability within the Cambodian Banking Sector as all banks and microfinance companies are now required by law to report accurate facts and figures relating to loan performance in the country. One of the largest challenges facing Cambodia is still the fact that the older population often lacks education, particularly in the countryside, which suffers from a lack of basic infrastructure. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid, although there has been significant aid from bilateral and multilateral donors. Donors pledged $504\u00a0million to the country in 2004,[84] while the Asian Development Bank alone has provided $850\u00a0million in loans, grants, and technical assistance.[174] Bribes are often demanded from companies operating in Cambodia when obtaining licences and permits, such as construction-related permits.[175] Cambodia ranked among the worst places in the world for organised labour in the 2015 International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) Global Rights Index, landing in the category of countries with \"no guarantee of rights\".'[176] In April 2016 Cambodia's National Assembly has adopted a Law on Trade Unions. \"The law was proposed at a time when workers have been staging sustained protests in factories and in the streets demanding wage increases and improvements in their working conditions\".[177] The concerns about Cambodia's new law are shared not only by labour and rights groups but international organisations more generally. The International Labour Organization Country Office for Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR, has noted that the law has \"several key concerns and gaps\".[178]"

In 2004, the number of road fatalities per 10,000 vehicles was ten times higher in Cambodia than in the developed world, and the number of road deaths had doubled in the preceding three years.[197] Cambodia's extensive inland waterways were important historically in international trade. The Mekong and the Tonle Sap River, their numerous tributaries, and the Tonle Sap provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometres (2,300 miles) navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 metres (2.0 feet) and another 282 kilometres (175 miles) navigable to craft drawing 1.8 metres (5.9 feet).[198] Cambodia has two major ports, Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, at the junction of the Bassac, the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap Rivers, is the only river port capable of receiving 8,000-ton ships during the wet season and 5,000-ton ships during the dry season. With increasing economic activity has come an increase in automobile use, though motorcycles still predominate.[199] \"Cyclo\" (as hand-me-down French) or Cycle rickshaws were popular in 1990s but are increasingly replaced by remorques (carriages attached to motorcycles) and rickshaws imported from India. Cyclos are unique to Cambodia in that the cyclist sits behind the passenger seat.[200] Cambodia has three commercial airports. In 2018, they handled a record of 10 million passengers.[201] Phnom Penh International Airport is the busiest airport in Cambodia. Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport is the second busiest, and serves the most international flights in and out of Cambodia.

The Khmers historically have lived near the lower Mekong River in a contiguous diagonal arc, from where modern-day Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia meet in the northwest, all the way to the mouth of the Mekong River in southeastern Vietnam.[citation needed] The Vietnamese are the second-largest ethnic minority in Cambodia, with an estimated 16,000 living in provinces concentrated in the southeast of the country adjacent to the Mekong Delta. Although the Vietnamese language has been determined to be a Mon\u201a\u00c4\u00ecKhmer language, there are very few cultural connections between the two peoples because the early Khmers were influenced by the Indian cultural sphere while the Vietnamese are part of the Chinese cultural sphere.[215] Ethnic tensions between the Khmer and the Vietnamese can be traced to the Post-Angkor Period (from the 16th to 19th centuries), during which time a nascent Vietnam and Thailand each attempted to vassalise a weakened post-Angkor Cambodia, and effectively dominate all of Indochina.[215] Chinese Cambodians are approximately 0.6% of the population.[216] Most Chinese are descended from 19th\u201a\u00c4\u00ec20th-century settlers who came in search of trade and commerce opportunities during the time of the French protectorate. Most are urban dwellers, engaged primarily in commerce.[citation needed] The indigenous ethnic groups of the mountains are known collectively as Montagnards or Khmer Loeu, a term meaning \"Highland Khmer\". They are descended from neolithic migrations of Mon\u201a\u00c4\u00ecKhmer speakers via southern China and Austronesian speakers from insular Southeast Asia. Being isolated in the highlands, the various Khmer Loeu groups were not Indianized like their Khmer cousins and consequently are culturally distant from modern Khmers and often from each other, observing many pre-Indian-contact customs and beliefs.[citation needed] The Cham are descended from the Austronesian people of Champa, a former kingdom on the coast of central and southern present-day Vietnam and former rival to the Khmer Empire. The Cham in Cambodia number under a million and often maintain separate villages in the southeast of the country. Almost all Cham in Cambodia are Muslims.[citation needed]"

English is widely taught in several universities and there is also a significant press in that language, while street signs are now bilingual in Khmer and English.[218] Due to this shift, mostly English is now used in Cambodia's international relationships, and it has replaced French both on Cambodia's stamps and, since 2002, on Cambodian currency.[219] The Khmer script is derived from the South Indian Pallava script."

Rural Cambodians wear a krama scarf which is a unique aspect of Cambodian clothing. The sampeah is a traditional Cambodian greeting or a way of showing respect to others. Khmer culture, as developed and spread by the Khmer empire, has distinctive styles of dance, architecture, and sculpture, which have been exchanged with neighbouring Laos and Thailand throughout history. Angkor Wat (Angkor means \"city\" and Wat means \"temple\") is the best-preserved example of Khmer architecture from the Angkorian era along with hundreds of other temples that have been discovered in and around the region. Traditionally, the Khmer people have a recorded information on Tra leaves. Tra leaf books record legends of the Khmer people, the Ramayana, the origin of Buddhism and other prayer books. They are taken care of by wrapping in cloth to protect from moisture and the climate.[242] Bon Om Touk (Cambodian Water & Moon Festival), the annual boat rowing contest, is the most attended Cambodian national festival. Held at the end of the rainy season when the Mekong River begins to sink back to its normal levels allowing the Tonle Sap River to reverse flow, approximately 10% of Cambodia's population attends this event each year to play games, give thanks to the moon, watch fireworks, dine, and attend the boat race in a carnival-type atmosphere.[243] Popular games include soccer, kicking a sey, which is similar to a footbag, and chess. Based on the classical Indian solar calendar and Theravada Buddhism, the Cambodian New Year is a major holiday that takes place in April.

Typically faster-paced than classical dance, folk dances display themes of the \"common person\" such as love, comedy or warding off evil spirits.[259] Social dances are those performed by guests at banquets, parties or other informal social gatherings. Khmer traditional social dances are analogous to those of other Southeast Asian nations. Examples include the circle dances Romvong and Romkbach as well as Saravan and Lam Leav. Modern western popular dances including Cha-cha, Bolero, and the Madison, have also influenced Cambodian social dance."

        "content": "Traditional Cambodian music dates back as far as the Khmer Empire.[260] Royal dances like the Apsara Dance are icons of the Cambodian culture as are the Mahori ensembles that accompany them. More rural forms of music include Chapei and Ayai. The former is popular among the older generation and is most often a solo performance of a man plucking a Cambodian guitar (chapei) in between a cappella verses. The lyrics usually have moral or religious theme. A Yai can be performed solo or by a man and woman and is often comedic in nature. It is a form of lyrical poetry, often full of double entendres, that can be either scripted or completely impromptu and ad-libbed. When sung by a duo, the man and women take turns, \"answering\" the other's verse or posing riddles for the other to solve, with short instrumental breaks in between verses. Pleng kaah (lit. \"wedding music\") is a set of traditional music and songs played both for entertainment and as accompaniment for the various ceremonial parts of a traditional, days-long Khmer wedding. Cambodian popular music is performed with western style instruments or a mixture of traditional and western instruments. Dance music is composed in particular styles for social dances. The music of crooner Sinn Sisamouth, Ros Sereysothea, and Pen Ran from the 1960s to the 1970s is considered to be the classic pop music of Cambodia. During the Khmer Rouge Revolution, many classic and popular singers of the 1960s and 1970s were murdered, starved to death, or overwork to death by the Khmer Rouge.[261] and many original master tapes from the period were lost or destroyed. In the 1980s, Keo Surath, (a refugee resettled in the United States) and others carried on the legacy of the classic singers, often remaking their popular songs. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the rise in popularity of kantrum, a music style of the Khmer Surin set to modern instrumentation.[262] The Australian hip hop group Astronomy Class has recorded with Kak Channthy, a native-born Cambodian female singer.[263][264] The Dengue Fever rock and roll band features a Cambodian female singer and back-up band from California. It is classified as \"world music\" and combines Cambodian music with Western-style rock."

The eighth storm of the season, Henri was one of six tropical cyclones to hit the United States in the year. Henri formed from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico in early September, and crossed over Florida as a tropical depression. Its remnants later moved into the Mid-Atlantic before dissipating completely. Henri caused little damage as a tropical cyclone. In Florida, it dropped heavy rainfall, though damage was limited to minor flooding damage. In Delaware and Pennsylvania, damage was greater, where heavy rainfall damaged hundreds of houses and businesses. The resulting floods in Delaware were described as a 1 in 500 year event. The total damage by Henri along its path amounted to $19.6\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $21.5\u00a0million 2006\u00a0USD), but no deaths were reported."

On September 1 the wave axis entered the Gulf of Mexico, and upon doing so convection steadily organized around a low-level center of circulation. The system moved northward and developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on September 3 while located about 300\u00a0miles (480\u00a0kilometers) west of Tampa, Florida. Embedded within a slow mid-latitude trough, the depression moved eastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri on September 5.[1] Despite strong southwesterly vertical shear, Henri continued intensifying while moving eastward, and reached a peak strength of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) later on September 5. Shortly thereafter, though, the shear greatly weakened the storm, and it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Henri was not able to recover its intensity, and made landfall near Clearwater, Florida on September 6 as a 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) tropical depression, and quickly crossed the state as it accelerated to the northeast.[1] Despite initial predictions of re-intensification over open waters due to potentially lower shear,[2] Henri failed to re-strengthen and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on September 8 off the coast of North Carolina.[1] The broad and disorganized remnant low remained nearly stationary due to a ridge of high pressure to its north.[1] Residual convection within the remnants of Henri remained disorganized, but forecasters kept watch for the potential for redevelopment.[3] However, it moved inland near Cape Hatteras on September 12 without reorganizing.[4] The remnants continued to the north and dissipated on September 17 over New England.[5]"

Two other areas experienced over 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm), though most areas received only light rainfall.[5] In Hernando County, a stationary thunderstorm dropped over 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) of rain in around an hour. It caused a rapid flooding of roads, though quickly retreated. Damage was minor, due to lack of many homes in the area.[11] A feeder band in Charlotte County dropped 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rain in three hours, flooding numerous streets and homes.[12] Throughout Florida, damage was minimal, and there were no deaths. However, lightning from a feeder band injured a man in Lee County, while an indirect injury occurred from a car crash due to hydroplaning.[1] In the Bahamas, outer rainbands from Henri dropped around 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) of rain. Winds in the archipelago gusted to 32\u00a0mph (51\u00a0km/h).[13] Just days after Hurricane Fabian struck Bermuda, moisture from Henri brought thunderstorms and heavy rainfall and thunderstorms totaling to 2.44 inches (62\u00a0mm) at the airport.[14] This hindered cleanup efforts, though caused no known damage.[15]"

Parts of the creek saw a 500-year flood, which has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year.[17] Numerous rivers in southeastern Pennsylvania also crested above their flood stage.[18] In Delaware, the flooding damaged numerous houses, including 194 in the Glenville area. The rapid flooding trapped numerous people in their cars and homes, forcing at least one rescue by helicopter. Those people were evacuated to nearby schools. The severe flooding washed out most of a bridge in Hockessin[16] and destroyed 6 Wilmington & Western Railroad bridges,[19] causing about $5\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $5.5\u00a0million 2006\u00a0USD) in damage.[20] The railroad bridges were still being rebuilt as of 2006.[21] Greenbank Mill, a historic gristmill complex, saw $450,000 in damage.[22] Damage in Delaware totaled to $16.1\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $17.5\u00a0million 2006\u00a0USD).[16] Flash flooding in Pennsylvania resulted in 2,600\u00a0emergency 911 calls and around 100\u00a0rescues for cars or houses.

The declaration designated the affected citizens eligible for grants to pay for temporary housing, house repairs, and serious disaster-related expenses. The declaration also allowed for federal funding for 75% of the repair cost for replacing public facilities.[24] By two months after the storm, 659\u00a0residents had applied for disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), totaling to just over $1\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $1.1\u00a0million 2006\u00a0USD). 141\u00a0small businesses applied for loans, totaling to around $2.5\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $2.75\u00a0million 2006\u00a0USD). In addition, FEMA received 183\u00a0applications for public assistance, which would be used for rebuilding public roads and buildings.[25] Over twenty\u00a0volunteer organizations met to establish a long-term committee to find resources for disaster recovery needs. One goal sought by the committee was to find a permanent housing solution for every one who was displaced from their houses from the storms. Volunteers also helped remove ruined appliances and furniture to local landfills, totaling to more than 300\u00a0tons.[26] State and county governments in Delaware purchased 171\u00a0homes following the damage in the Glenville area, the highest number of houses purchased in the state due to storm damage.[27] The house purchasing was done to mitigate the flood damage by restoring the area as a wetland.[28] On September 26, President Bush also declared Chester County, Pennsylvania as a disaster area following the damage of Henri, Tropical Storm Isabel, and severe flooding unrelated to either tropical cyclone.[29] By a month after the declaration, 342\u00a0homeowners and business owners applied for disaster aid, totaling to around $600,000 (2003\u00a0USD, $660,000 2006\u00a0USD).[30]"

It is centered around a 40-mile (64\u00a0km) stretch of the Delaware River designated the Middle Delaware National Scenic River. At the area's southern end lays the Delaware Water Gap, a dramatic mountain pass where the river cuts between Blue Mountain and Kittatinny Mountain. More than 4 million people visit the recreation area annually, many from the nearby New York metropolitan area. Canoeing, kayaking, and rafting trips down the river are popular in the summer. Other activities include hiking, rock climbing, swimming, fishing, hunting, camping, cycling, cross-country skiing, and horseback riding. Worthington State Forest and a section of the long-distance Appalachian Trail are located within the area, alongside numerous waterfalls and historic sites. The region, known historically as the Minisink, was inhabited by the Munsee at the time of Dutch and French Huguenot colonization in the late 17th century. The national recreation area was established in 1965 ahead of a dam project which would have flooded a large region north of the Water Gap. Over 15,000 people were displaced as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acquired land for the reservoir. The controversial project was ultimately canceled in 1978 and the land transferred to the recreation area. There are efforts as of 2022[3][4] to re-designate the area as a national park, the first in New Jersey or Pennsylvania."

On 19 August 1955, the river gauge at Riegelsville, Pennsylvania recorded that the Delaware River reached a crest of 38.85 feet, or 16.85 feet above flood stage. A project to dam the river near Tocks Island was in the works before the 1955 floods.  But several deaths and severe damages resulting from these floods brought the issue of flood control to the national level.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed the construction of the dam, which would have created a 37-mile (60-km) long lake between Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with depths of up to 140 feet. The area around the lake would be established as the Tocks Island National Recreation Area under the oversight of the National Park Service, to offer recreation activities such as hunting, hiking, fishing, and boating. In addition to flood control and recreation, the dam would be used to generate hydroelectric power and provide a clean water supply to New York City and Philadelphia. Starting in 1960, the present-day area of the Recreation Area was acquired for the Army Corps of Engineers through eminent domain. Approximately 15,000 people were displaced by the condemnation of property along the Delaware River and the surrounding area. An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 dwellings and outbuildings were demolished in preparation for the dam project and subsequent flooding of the valley. This included many irreplaceable historical sites and structures connected with the valley's Native American and colonial heritage."

The area was intended to encompass a narrow strip of shoreline surrounding the reservoir,[6] in part to make the project more cost-effective.[7] The dam project was embroiled in controversy, engendering strong opposition from environmental groups and embittered, displaced residents. Due to this opposition, the unavailability of funding for the dam, and a geological assessment revealing the dam would be located near active fault lines, the federal government ultimately decided to abandon the project in 1978. The lands acquired were then transferred to the National Park Service and added to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.[8][7][9][10]"

        "content": "Hurricane Newton was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula at hurricane strength since Hurricane Odile in 2014. The fifteenth tropical depression, fifteenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Newton formed from a tropical wave to the south of Mexico on September 4, 2016. Moving northwards through an environment conducive for additional development, Newton rapidly strengthened, reaching hurricane strength on the following day. Newton made landfall on the Baja California Peninsula just below peak strength on the same day. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the peninsula caused some slight weakening, but Newton remained a hurricane until it entered the Gulf of California, at which time increasing wind shear caused Newton to weaken at a faster pace, and the system made landfall in Sonora late on September 6 as a strong tropical storm. The cyclone continued to rapidly weaken over the rugged terrain of Sonora, and it degenerated into a remnant low just south of the Mexico\u2013United States border on September 7. The remnants of Newton dissipated early on the following day. In advance of Newton's arrival, authorities in Mexico took several steps to ensure the safety of residents, tourists as well as property. A large number of watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Mexico. In Baja California Sur, ports and airports were closed before the storm, several evacuation centers were opened for stranded tourists and residents, military personnel were deployed, and policemen deployed to prevent post-storm looting. Heavy rains and strong winds from Newton and its outer bands wrought widespread damage in western Mexico. Several communities were flooded across many states, which led authorities to rescue stranded people from them. Thousands of houses were also damaged due to rainfall. Near the location of landfall, the storm led to loss of power and access to drinking water while other communities were isolated due to damage to road infrastructure. In the Gulf of California, a shrimp boat capsized due to rough seas, leading to five deaths. The post-tropical remnants of Newton later brought heavy rain to the Southeastern United States, leading to minor damage. Overall, Newton caused $95.8 million (2016 USD) in damage and 12 deaths."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Newton can be traced to a tropical wave that crossed the west coast of Africa on August 25, 2016. Though the wave initially had some deep convection, the showers and thunderstorms associated with it decreased significantly after it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean.[1] The National Hurricane Center first mentioned the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis of the wave on August 28.[2] The wave traversed the tropical Atlantic quickly, reaching the Lesser Antilles the following day and Central America on September 1, finally moving into the vicinity of a surface trough located to south of the coast of Mexico on September 3. A low pressure area developed within the wave early on September 4, and associated deep convection became sufficiently organised for the system to be classified as a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC that day.[1] Operationally, the NHC did not initiate advisories until nine hours later.[3] Six hours after formation, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, whereupon it was assigned the name Newton. At the time of formation, Newton was located along the periphery of a mid-tropospheric ridge extending across the Gulf of Mexico and northern Mexico, with a surface trough covering the western United States and extending southwestward over the Pacific Ocean. This steering pattern caused Newton to move northwards, slowly at first, accelerating as it approached the trough.[1] Located over warm (30\u00a0\u00b0C) waters and in a favorable environment characterized by minimal deep-layer wind shear, Newton underwent a 36-hour period of rapid intensification between 1800 UTC on September 4 and 0600 UTC on September 6. Data from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter flight late on 5 September indicated that Newton attained hurricane strength at 1800 UTC that day while located 130 miles (210\u00a0km) west-southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico. The storm continued to strengthen after the plane departed the storm \u2014 objective Dvorak estimates continued to increase after the mission \u2014 and the NHC estimated that Newton attained peak intensity with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 90 miles per hour (145\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 977 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg) at 0600 UTC on September 6.[1] The northern and eastern parts of Newton's eyewall struck the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula a few hours after peak intensity, and the center of the storm passed just a few miles offshore of Cabo San Lucas. Newton weakened slightly as its eastern eyewall passed over the mountainous terrain of Baja California Sur, and made landfall near El Cu\u00f1a\u00f1o on the western side of the peninsula with estimated sustained winds of 85 miles per hour (135\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 979 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg) at 1400 UTC on that day. Passage over the Baja California Peninsula caused Newton to weaken gradually throughout the day, and its convection became increasingly asymmetric and displaced to the north. The storm, however, maintained hurricane strength over land, and, as indicated by microwave imagery around 0000 UTC on September 7, redeveloped a closed eyewall after emerging over the warm waters of the Gulf of California. This trend proved to be short-lived: increasing deep-layer wind shear caused Newton to weaken into a tropical storm by 0600 UTC about 60 miles (95\u00a0km) west of Guaymas. Two and a half hours later, Newton made its second and final landfall just south of Bah\u00eda de Kino in the state of Sonora with estimated winds of 65 miles per hour (105\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 998 millibars (29.5\u00a0inHg). The cyclone continued to rapidly weaken under the influence of increasing shear and rugged terrain, and lost all its deep convection later that day. Newton degenerated into a remnant low by 1800 UTC just south of the Mexico\u2013United States border, about 40 miles (64\u00a0km) southwest of Nogales, Arizona. The remnants turned northeast and dissipated near the Arizona-Mexico border soon after 0600 UTC on September 8.[1]"

Simultaneously, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of the Baja California Peninsula as well as mainland Mexico. By early on September 5, large parts of the coasts of the Mexican states of Sinaloa, Sonora, and Baja California Sur were under tropical cyclone watches and warnings, which were discontinued gradually as Newton moved inland and weakened. All watches and warnings were discontinued by 2100 UTC on September 5 as Newton lost strength over Sonora.[1] During the afternoon of September 5, authorities issued a \"yellow\" alert in southern Jalisco,[5] \"green\" alert for the state of Baja California Sur,[6] Sinaloa, northern and central Jalisco, Nayarit, Colima, and Michoacan. A blue alert was declared in Guerrero and Baja California.[5] Classes were suspended in Colima,[7] in three municipalities in northern Jalisco,[8] in Baja California Sur,[9] and in Mazatlan.[10] Around 14,000 tourists remained in Los Cabos as airlines cancelled flights ahead of Newton. Tourists were advised to stay in their hotels.[11] Another 1,500 people took shelter in Los Cabos, while authorities opened shelters across Baja California Sur with a total capacity of 16,000. More than a third of the flights at Los Cabos International Airport were cancelled.[12] The Third Military Zone in La Paz deployed 800 military personnel to throughout Baja California Sur to protect citizens from the advancing storm. At the same time, plans were activated to safeguard tourists in the state. The port of Los Cabos was closed by 7 p.m. on September 5, while the ports of La Paz, Loreto, Santa Rosal\u00eda and Comond\u00fa closed at midnight.[13] Local airports were closed late on the same day, and small boats were barred from using local ports.[14] Boat owners pulled fishing craft from water and business owners nailed boards and sheets of plywood to windows in Cabo San Lucas. Officials evacuated low-lying areas and opened 18 shelters in schools in Los Cabos and Cabo San Lucas, as well as 38 others elsewhere in Baja California Sur, while warning people against panic buying. Police officers were deployed at shopping malls to prevent looting as had occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Odile in 2014.[11]"

In the capital city of Tuxtla, almost 900 homes were damaged and six were demolished, leaving 3,500 displaced.[17] In Guerrero, a total of 695 homes were flooded and 12 communities were isolated. Due to the flooding, officials evacuated about 150 people in seven shelters. Due to the flooding in Guerrero, 817 troops, 25 radio stations, 24 first aid kits, and 124 automobiles were dispatched for cleanup.[18] In Petatlan, two people were swept away in a river; one was found alive, while the other died.[18] Seventy homes were damaged and 200 people were trapped in the resort town of Acapulco, prompting air evacuations via police, marines and the army.[19] Further north, severe flooding was reported in Colima and Jalisco. Two rivers overflowed, resulting in several communities being isolated.[20] The communities of El Sentinel and El Rebalse were the worst affected by the storm. Several people sought shelter in schools and other public spaces.[21] Statewide, 20 families were evacuated because of flooding.[22] While damage near the landfall location was minor, the hurricane's heavy rains deluged the municipality of Mulege. There, power and drinking water access was lost. In the municipality's seat of Santa Rosalia, dozens of houses and vehicles were buried in rocks and debris. Nearby, the communities of San Ignacio and Herocina Mulege were cut off from the outside world due to damage to the Mexican Federal Highway 1.[23] Five people were arrested for trying to loot two convenience stores in Los Cabos.[24] Offshore, in the Gulf of California, a shrimp boat capsized due to rough seas, resulting in five people being swept away.[25] Two dead bodies were later found ashore while the other three were briefly missing.[26] before being reported dead on September 8.[27] Damage across Baja California Sur reached 700\u00a0million pesos (US$37\u00a0million).[28] Guaymas suffered extensive impacts from the hurricane, with more than 3,000\u00a0homes damaged. Total losses in the municipality reached 1.1\u00a0billion pesos (US$58\u00a0million).[29] The remnants of Newton brought heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States, peaking at 5.67\u00a0in (144\u00a0mm) at Miller Carr Canyon in southeastern Arizona. Precipitation reached 3.43\u00a0in (87\u00a0mm) near Texico, New Mexico, the highest in that state.[30] Losses in Kansas were at US$752,100.[31]"

        "content": "The 2020 Brazil rainforest wildfires were a series of forest fires that were affecting Brazil, with 44,013 outbreaks of fires registered between January and August in the Amazonas and Pantanal.[2][3] Within the Amazon, 6,315 outbreaks of fire were detected in the same period.[4] Within the Pantanal, the volume of fires is equivalent to those of the past six years[5] and there have been actions by NGOs and volunteers to save endangered animals, such as the jaguar.[6] It was expected that the health systems of the Amazon region, already overloaded by the COVID-19 pandemic, would be even more overloaded due to respiratory diseases due to smoke emitted by the wildfires.[7][8] Expertise carried out points out that the fires in the Pantanal were started by human action[9] and the Environmental Police Station investigates who are possibly responsible.[10] Douglas Morton, head of NASA's Biospheric Sciences Laboratory, considers fires to be \"unprecedented\".[11] Although the Brazilian government has instituted a 120-day ban on burning in the Amazon, an analysis led by NASA indicates that this was of little effect.[12][13] Between May 28 and August 25, 516 fire points were detected covering an area of 376,416 hectares.[14] In August, President Jair Bolsonaro's response was that \"the media and foreign governments are presenting a false narrative about the Amazon\".[15] The same month Brazil's National Institute for Space Research reported that satellite data shows that the number of fires in the Amazon increased by 28% to ~6,800 fires in July compared to the ~5,300 wildfires in July 2019. This indicated a, potentially worsened, repeat of 2019's accelerated destruction of one of the world's largest protectable buffers against global warming in 2020.[16][17][18] Satellites in September recorded 32,017 hotspots in the world's largest rainforest, a 61% rise from the same month in 2019. In September INPE reported that 1,359\u00a0km2 of the Brazilian Amazon have burned off in August, which may put the effectiveness of the contemporary response against the deforestation \u2013 such as considerations of economic interventions and the current military operation \u2013 into question.[19] The 6,087\u00a0km2 of lost rainforest in 2020 as of early September \u2013 ~95% of the period in 2019[19] \u2013 is about the size of Palestine. In the Pantanal, part of the fire started in private areas or legal reserves (which is protected by law) and spread to indigenous territories.[20] On 13 September preliminary data based on satellite images, indicate that 1.5 million hectares have burned in the Pantanal region since the start of August, surpassing the previous fire season record from 2005.[21] On September 15 it was reported that 23,500\u00a0km2 \u2013 ~12% of the Pantanal \u2013 have burned off in 2020,[22] killing millions of vertebrates.[23]"

        "content": "The origins of Cyclone Gervaise were in early February 1975 from a circular area of convection, or thunderstorms, located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone southwest of Diego Garcia in the south-west Indian Ocean. The system organized as it moved generally to the southwest, a trajectory it would maintain for several days due to a subtropical ridge to its southeast, and an area of low pressure near the Mascarene Islands. On February\u00a02, the Mauritius Meteorological Services[a] named the storm Gervaise. Two days later, the storm attained hurricane status, or maximum sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[3] Late on February\u00a05, Gervaise passed about 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) southeast of St. Brandon. Continuing southwestward, the cyclone struck Mauritius on February\u00a06, with the calm of the eye lasting for three hours. That day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[b] estimated peak winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[4] On February\u00a07, Gervaise passed about 130\u00a0km (80\u00a0mi) southeast of R\u00e9union. The track shifted to the south and southeast over time, steered by a passing cold front. On February\u00a010, Gervaise dissipated within the cold front.[3] Gervaise first affected St. Brandon, producing wind gusts of over 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph), along with heavy rainfall. Cyclone Gervaise killed 10\u00a0people during its passage of Mauritius. Its strongest wind gusts occurred after the passage of the eye, peaking at 280\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) at Mon Desert. Heavy rainfall affected the island for several days, reaching 674\u00a0mm (26.5\u00a0in) at Grosse Roche. The high winds knocked down power lines, radio transmission with Vacoas for 24\u00a0hours, and many crops. About 25% of the island's sugar cane crop was lost. The storm damaged several houses, leaving thousands homeless. The cyclone last affected R\u00e9union, where it produced wind gusts of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph). Gervaise also dropped heavy rainfall on the island, reaching 548\u00a0mm (21.6\u00a0in) at Plaine des Cafres.[3] It caused substantial damage to properties, vegetation and wildlife. Moored yachts around the coast were washed hundreds of yards inland in places due to the storm surge and in the Mauritian capital Port Louis, a cargo ship of ca. 10,000 tonnes was washed up on to the quay. 34 injured, 3,706 homeless."

This was due to cooler than normal water temperatures and the Walker circulation \u2013 a broad atmospheric circulation \u2013 causing unusually moist conditions in the eastern Indian Ocean and unusually dry conditions in the western Indian Ocean. The basin includes the waters of the ocean south of the equator and west of 90\u00ba\u00a0E to the eastern coast of Africa. There were nine tropical or subtropical cyclones during the season, including five weak tropical disturbances or depressions, mostly in the northeastern portion of the basin or to the east of Madagascar. The first of these systems developed on 25\u00a0October 2010, which had its origins in the northeastern portion of the basin. On 29\u00a0November, the first named storm \u2013 Abele \u2013 also formed in the same area, strengthening to become one of the season's two tropical cyclones \u2013 storms with maximum sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). The strongest system of the season was Cyclone Bingiza, which attained peak winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) off the northeastern coast of Madagascar in February. Bingiza was also the only storm to cause severe effects on land, causing heavy damage and 34\u00a0fatalities across Madagascar. Moderate Tropical Storm Cherono developed in March and traversed much of the ocean, only brushing by the island of Rodrigues. The final system was a subtropical depression that intensified south of Madagascar, becoming extratropical on 16\u00a0April to end the season."

The Walker circulation \u2013 a broad atmospheric circulation \u2013 caused unusually moist conditions in the eastern Indian Ocean while producing an increase in subsidence and unusually dry conditions in the western Indian Ocean. In addition, sea surface temperatures were below normal from 5\u00b0\u201315\u00b0\u00a0S and west of 90\u00b0\u00a0E, which limited storm formation near the Chagos Archipelago, typically a common area of formation. By the end of the season, there were only three named storms, the fewest in 50\u00a0years, although there was also a subtropical cyclone with gale-force winds that could have been named. In terms of total days in which cyclones were active, the season was slightly behind the 1982\u201383 season, thus making the 2010\u201311 season the second-quietest on record. The season also marked a global trend of decreasing tropical cyclone activity over the preceding five years, although the basin experienced a sudden shift toward increased activity in the subsequent season.[4] M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's meteorological office in R\u00e9union (MFR) \u2013 the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the South-West Indian Ocean \u2013 tracked and named all tropical cyclones from the east coast of Africa to 90\u00b0 E.[5] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy\u00a0\u2013 United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region,[6] also issued advisories for storms during the season.[7]"

Decreasing wind shear and improved inflow favored further development.[17] On 28\u00a0November, the MFR designated the system as a zone of disturbed weather in the far northeastern portion of the basin.[18] Early the next day, the agency upgraded the system to Tropical Disturbance 02 after the convection organized further.[19] Also on 29\u00a0November, the TCWC Perth classified the disturbance as Tropical Low 02U,[20] and the JTWC designated it as Tropical Cyclone 03S about 1,295\u00a0km (805\u00a0mi) west of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.[21] After the storm's development, the convection pulsed around the circulation, and was initially disrupted by wind shear in the region.[22] Despite the circulation being exposed from the thunderstorms, the MFR upgraded the disturbance to a depression on 30\u00a0November,[23] and further to Moderate Tropical Storm Abele on 1\u00a0December.[24] By that time, the convection had consolidated over the center,[25] which developed an eye amid lower wind shear.[26] The MFR upgraded Abele to a severe tropical storm and later a tropical cyclone on 2\u00a0December, estimating peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[18] The JTWC assessed 1\u00a0minute winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph).[27] By that time, Abele had turned to the south and southeast ahead of an approaching trough.[28] Cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear caused the convection to weaken, and the winds dropped accordingly.[29] Late on 2\u00a0December, Abele crossed 90\u00b0E into the Australian region; the storm continued weakening and later became extratropical on 4\u00a0December, dissipating the next day.[18]"

Good outflow and warm waters favored further intensification.[55] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on 17\u00a0March, the MFR upgraded the system to a tropical depression,[53] and a few hours later, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S about 925\u00a0km (575\u00a0mi) southeast of Diego Garcia, an island in the central Indian Ocean.[56] Gradually intensifying, the system moved steadily to the west-southwest, steered around the northern periphery of a ridge.[56] Late on March\u00a017, the MFR upgraded the depression to Moderate Tropical Storm Cherono.[53] This marked the latest date for the third named storm of a season.[4] On March\u00a018, Cherono attained peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) according to the MFR,[53] and 1\u00a0minute winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) according to the JTWC.[7] After that time, the circulation became exposed from the convection, affected by dry air in the region,[57] as well as increased wind shear.[58] On 19\u00a0March, the JTWC discontinued advisories,[7] and operationally the MFR downgraded the system to a tropical depression that day,[58] although a post-season analysis indicated Cherono remained a moderate tropical storm for two more days.[53] At 21:00\u00a0UTC on 19\u00a0March, the storm passed about 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) south of Rodrigues island, producing winds of 31\u00a0km/h (20\u00a0mph).[59] The storm continued producing pulsing convection, increasing over the center on 20\u00a0March due to a temporary increase in wind shear.[60] However, the shear returned and the convection weakened on 21\u00a0March due to an approaching upper-level trough,[61] and Cherono weakened to tropical depression status.[53] The same trough turned the storm to the south and southeast.[62] On 23\u00a0March, the system became extratropical as it curved eastward. The low weakened further the next day, dissipating on 25\u00a0March.[53]"

Located in a baroclinic environment, the system was located beneath an upper-level low, resulting in an unusual structure. However, warm waters and low wind shear favored development.[64] Late on 11\u00a0April, the MFR classified the system as a zone of disturbed weather, and soon after designated it as a tropical disturbance.[65] On 13\u00a0April, the MFR reclassified the system as Subtropical Depression 09, about 360\u00a0km (220\u00a0mi) southeast of Fort Dauphin. The system's asymmetric structure \u2013 the strongest winds were located in a convective rainband to the south of the center \u2013 resulted in the subtropical designation.[66] Late on 13\u00a0April, the system attained gale-force winds, although it remained an unnamed subtropical depression.[65] The MFR later noted that the storm could have been named, but the agency decided against it due to the structure and the location.[4] After moving clockwise, the storm began moving southwestward,[65] steered by a ridge. The storm gradually intensified,[67] and the convection increased around the center, although the wind field remained very large. Despite decreasing water temperatures,[68] the storm attained peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) on 15\u00a0April.[65] That day, the system also developed a warm thermal core, similar in structure to a tropical cyclone.[69] Increased wind shear disrupted the convection, causing the storm to transition into an extratropical cyclone on 16\u00a0April.[70] The system turned to the southeast and was absorbed by an approaching cold front on 17\u00a0April.[63]"

The circulation moved southward away from R\u00e9union, becoming increasingly defined.[72] On January\u00a030, the MFR classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 04.[73] However, the system soon weakened after it encountered cooler waters and stronger wind shear, and the MFR discontinued advisories early on 31\u00a0January.[74] By 2\u00a0February, the remnants of the disturbance became extratropical while accelerating to the southeast.[75] On 14\u00a0February, a weak low was present north of Rodrigues island with disorganized convection due to easterly wind shear.[76] By the following day, the convection had become more persistent, accompanied by a broad circulation.[77] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on 15\u00a0February, the MFR classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 06 to the northeast of R\u00e9union.[78] Continued wind shear prevented significant development,[79] and the system moved southward, developing intermittently strong convection.[80] On 18\u00a0February, the MFR discontinued advisories,[81] although the remnant circulation persisted for several more days.[82] Toward the end of March, the ITCZ produced an increase in convection in the Australian basin, accompanied by a disorganized center. The system moved westward over an area of warm water temperatures,[83] and after crossing 90\u00baE into the basin, the MFR classified it as Tropical Disturbance 08 on 29\u00a0March after the convection organized more.[84] The circulation became better defined, and the MFR anticipated that the system would eventually intensify into a severe tropical storm.[85] However, poor inflow and unfavorable wind shear prevented the system from organizing,[86] and the MFR discontinued advisories on March\u00a031 after the circulation remained exposed from the convection.[87] The circulation persisted for a few more days before becoming poorly defined on 4\u00a0April.[88]"

        "content": " The 1933 Chesapeake\u2013Potomac hurricane[1] was among the most damaging hurricanes in the Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. The sixth storm and third hurricane of the very active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed in the eastern Atlantic, where it moved west-northwestward and eventually became a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.[nb 1] A strong ridge over New England allowed a continued northwest course, bringing the storm south of Bermuda and later toward the middle coast of the eastern United States. Advanced warning allowed hundreds of people to evacuate ahead of the hurricane making landfall. It did so in northeastern North Carolina on August\u00a023 with winds of about 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). Soon after, the eye crossed over Norfolk, Virginia, the first time that happened since 1821. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm over northern Virginia shortly before passing near Washington, D.C., becoming the worst tropical cyclone there since 1896. Curving northward, the storm moved through Pennsylvania and New York before losing tropical characteristics on August\u00a025. Now extratropical, the former hurricane moved across Atlantic Canada, dissipating on August\u00a028. Across the eastern United States, the hurricane left widespread damage amounting to over $40\u00a0million (equivalent to about $800 million in 2020[4]) and causing at least 47\u00a0deaths. Although the storm struck North Carolina, damage in the state totaled only about $250,000,[nb 2] largely to crops and transport. Along the Chesapeake Bay, the storm produced 100-year flooding from its storm surge, setting records that remained for 70\u00a0years. In Virginia, flooding covered downtown portions of Norfolk in the southeast and Alexandria in the north. Damage in the state was estimated at $17.5\u00a0million. Similarly heavy damage occurred in Maryland, including over $7\u00a0million to crops. High waves along the coast eroded beaches and created a new inlet at Ocean City. The highest rainfall associated with the hurricane was 13.28\u00a0in (337\u00a0mm) at York, Pennsylvania. In the state, the rains flooded several rivers which forced thousands to evacuate. In neighboring New Jersey, high waves wrecked boats and destroyed a fishing pier, while in New York, flooding caused traffic jams. In Atlantic Canada, heavy rainfall assisted firefighters in combating wildfires, and the associated winds caused isolated power outages."

        "content": "On August\u00a013, a tropical depression developed near the west coast of Africa, southeast of Cape Verde, with an associated closed circulation. Based on observations from a nearby ship, it is estimated the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm while moving generally to the west-northwest. For several days the storm continued this general trajectory, eventually shifting more to the northwest. Based on interpolation of reports, it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on August\u00a016 while halfway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles.[5] The Weather Bureau began tracking the system on August\u00a018.[6] Later that day, a ship reported a pressure of 948\u00a0mbar (28.0\u00a0inHg), suggesting winds of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h). This made the hurricane a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Another ship report on August\u00a020 indicated a pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg) while reporting hurricane winds, suggesting peak winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[5] After remaining near peak intensity for three days, the hurricane began steadily weakening while curving more to the west-northwest,[5] a rare track for the region due to steering from a ridge over New England.[7] On August\u00a021, the storm passed about 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) southwest of Bermuda. At 1000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023, the hurricane made landfall along the northern Outer Banks of North Carolina,[5] near Nags Head,[1] with a pressure of 963\u00a0mbar (28.4\u00a0inHg). Based on the steady weakening, coastal observations, and a larger than normal size, landfall winds were estimated at 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). A few hours later, the hurricane made another landfall on the North Carolina mainland after crossing the Albemarle Sound. While the hurricane continued to the northwest, the eye briefly moved over Norfolk, Virginia,[5] for the first time since the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane.[1] Early on August\u00a024, the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm while passing near Washington, D.C. Curving to the north, the storm crossed Pennsylvania and into New York, where it weakened further into a tropical depression. On August\u00a025, the former hurricane turned to the east near the Canada\u2013US border, and after interacting with a cold front, became extratropical. It emerged from Maine and briefly re-intensified, moving across southern Nova Scotia with gale-force winds. On August\u00a028, the circulation dissipated to the south of Newfoundland.[5]"

As the hurricane approached land, the warnings were extended southward to Southport, North Carolina. In Norfolk, Virginia, most ships either remained at port or sought shelter due to advance warning.[6] Residents were advised to evacuate in Ocean View, Virginia Beach, and Willoughby Spit,[9] and about 350\u00a0people left their houses in Virginia Beach.[10] Along the coast, the United States Coast Guard rescued more than 200\u00a0people, many of whom due to capsized boats.[7] A 1993 article published in the Monthly Weather Review considered the storm to have been \"one of the most severe storms that has ever visited the Middle Atlantic coast.\"[6] Flooding affected a larger portion of the northeastern United States than any other hurricane in the 1900s after Hurricane Agnes in 1972.[7] The Federal Emergency Management Agency later used high water levels from the storm as a 100-year event for the Chesapeake Bay region. The next storm to approach the storm surge levels was Isabel in 2003, which was lower in most locations in Virginia,[11] although higher in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore due to sea level rise.[12] This hurricane caused damage from North Carolina through New Jersey, due to the combination of high winds and storm tides,[6] and left at least 47\u00a0people dead overall.[7]"

Kohler hailing from Baltimore and bound for Haiti was driven ashore at Hatteras by the high winds. Across the region, the storm downed power lines, washed out highways, wrecked boats, and destroyed houses, and overall damage in the state was around $250,000.[14] As the hurricane moved into Virginia, winds were as strong as 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h) at Cape Henry, while Norfolk reported winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[5] The latter city reported a record high tide of 9.8\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) above normal at Sewell's Point, which flooded the downtown section with 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) of water. Water levels were 5 to 8\u00a0ft (1.5 to 2.4\u00a0m) higher than any previous high water mark in Newport News and most of Fort Eustis was flooded. In Hampton the storm surge flooded Langley Air Force Base, swamped homes and businesses, wrecked boats, and destroyed fishing piers. Rainfall in Chesapeake reached about 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm),[1] and reached about 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) in Norfolk.[6] Flooding near Norfolk damaged crops,[1] and after its downtown section was flooded, residents were forced to travel by boat. When the flood levels dropped, many fish were left behind in the streets.[7] High water levels of around 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) along the York River destroyed buildings at Gloucester Point.[1] In Virginia Beach, the storm knocked down about 600\u00a0trees, many of them about 100\u00a0years old, and over 79,000\u00a0people lost telephone service.[15] Due to advance warning, there was minimal damage to shipping in the region.[6] However, high waves damaged the steamer Madison with 90\u00a0people on board and caused it to drift off Cape Charles, which necessitated rescue from the Coast Guard.[10] Inland flooding occurred along the James River as far west as Richmond, where damage was limited to downed trees and broken windows. The pier of the Jamestown Ferry was washed out in Surry and a marina at Jordan Point near Hopewell was wrecked after the river reached the highest level on record. A powerful storm surge moved up the Chesapeake Bay and flooded waterfront locations. At Colonial Beach along the Potomac River, the surge flooded the town with 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water and wrecked a local amusement park. The Potomac in Alexandria was at its highest level since 1899, causing floods 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) deep along U.S. Route 1, and flooding the Old Town section. High winds in the city caused power outages, and flooding along the Cameron Run washed out a bridge. The combination of rain and winds damaged crops in Fairfax and Loudoun counties, mainly to corn and peaches.[1] Statewide, the storm caused $5.25\u00a0million in crop damage, largely to corn and tobacco.[15] Damage in the state was estimated at $17.5\u00a0million, and there were 15\u00a0deaths.[14] After the storm, about 350\u00a0people helped clear debris from the streets of Norfolk.[16]"

The storm damaged or destroyed several hotels in the region.[1] Power, telephone, and telegraph outages occurred from Cape Charles through Delaware.[6] In Baltimore, 7.62\u00a0in (194\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell in 24\u00a0hours, setting a record and causing flooding.[14] The storm surge wrecked a steamboat pier and promenade at Chesapeake Beach, and damaged or destroyed 70\u00a0houses in neighboring North Beach. In Cheverly, flooding caused nine cars of a train to derail,[7] killing four people.[16] Statewide, the storm caused about $7\u00a0million in crop damage, mostly to tobacco, tomato, and corn. The high tides caused $3\u00a0million in damage to the fishing industry, having damaged or destroyed many boats and docks. There was about $90,000 worth of damage to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis,[6] after docks were damaged.[7] Throughout the state, the hurricane caused about $10\u00a0million in property damage, with another $1.1\u00a0million to federal properties, about $960,000 in transportation damage, and $364,000 in utility damage.[14] In neighboring Delaware, road damage was about $150,000,[6] after three bridges were wrecked along DuPont Highway.[16] Rainfall in the state reached 13.24\u00a0in (336\u00a0mm) in Bridgeville. In Washington, D.C., the storm dropped 6.39\u00a0in (162\u00a0mm) of rainfall, at the time the highest on record for a single day total.[7] High winds knocked down trees and destroyed the roofs of several houses. Along the Anacostia River, flooding surpassed a seawall, and traffic was disrupted when the Benning Bridge was flooded with 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) of water. The Washington-Hoover Airport was also flooded.[1] Damage in the nation's capital was the worst since a tropical storm in 1896.[10] The highest rainfall associated with the hurricane was 13.28\u00a0in (337\u00a0mm) near York, Pennsylvania.[17] On August\u00a024, the minimum pressure in Philadelphia dropped to 996 millibars (29.4\u00a0inHg), which was the lowest on record in the month of August at the time. Wind gusts in the city reached 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h). In the surrounding area, winds and rainfall caused $1\u00a0million in damage, mostly to crops and houses, and there were four deaths.[14] Rainfall caused the worst flooding in the Lehigh Valley since 1902. In York County, floods destroyed 47\u00a0bridges, while in York proper, about 3,000\u00a0people evacuated along the swollen Codorus Creek.[7] Hurricane-force winds potentially affected portions of Delaware and southern New Jersey. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, winds reached 76\u00a0mph (122\u00a0km/h) at a height of 171\u00a0ft (52\u00a0m), which is 67\u00a0mph (108\u00a0km/h) at sea level.[5] At the time, this was the highest wind report for the station in the month of August.[14] Rainfall in Atlantic City totaled 8.12\u00a0in (206\u00a0mm), including 2.25\u00a0in (57\u00a0mm) that fell in an hour on August\u00a020,[7] which was the monthly average. Two people drowned along the Jersey Shore due to high waves,[18] and the storm capsized nine boats.[19] The waves destroyed a 300\u00a0ft (91\u00a0m) long fishing pier in Cape May.[10] High winds damaged the boardwalk while streets were flooded in Atlantic City, and there was about $3\u00a0million in damage.[14] The storm spawned a tornado in Wildwood. At Picatinny Arsenal, residents and members of the military helped prevent a dam from breaking.[7] Sustained winds of around 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) were observed across northern New York,[5] while the top of the Empire State Building reported a gust of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[16] Heavy rainfall in the state increased water levels along streams, causing one person to drown at Mount Tremper.[14] After a dam broke, 190\u00a0people at Godeffroy were stranded until they were rescued by a fire crew.[20] A power outage during the storm caused the Statue of Liberty torch to extinguish for the first time since 1929.[7] Streets and basements of New York City were flooded after the heavy rainfall.[19] The combination of flooding and fallen trees caused heavy traffic jams.[16] The former hurricane passed near southern Quebec as a tropical depression, and later crossed southern Nova Scotia as an extratropical cyclone. Along Lake Ontario, winds reached 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h), and in Montreal, winds reached 21\u00a0mph (34\u00a0km/h). After a dry summer, the storm's accompanying rainfall was beneficial, reaching 4.4 inches (110\u00a0mm) in Fredericton, New Brunswick and 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The rains helped farmers in Ontario and assisted firefighters in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In Montreal, 2.4 inches (61\u00a0mm) of rainfall flooded a tunnel. Gusty winds knocked down power lines in portions of Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Nova Scotia. Overall effects were minor, limited to some utility damage and delays for shipping.[21]"

        "content": " Hurricane Rafael was a long-lived category 1 hurricane that produced minor damage in the northeastern Caribbean Sea in mid-October\u00a02012. The seventeenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the 2012 hurricane season, Rafael originated from a tropical wave roughly 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) south-southeast of Saint Croix on October\u00a012; because the system already contained tropical storm-force winds, it skipped tropical depression status. Though initially disorganized due to moderate wind shear, a subsequent decrease allowed for shower and thunderstorm activity to develop in earnest by October\u00a014, 2012. While moving north-northwestward the following morning, Rafael intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane. A cold front off the East Coast of the United States caused the system to turn northward and eventually northeastward by October\u00a016, 2012, at which time Rafael attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). As the cyclone entered a more stable atmosphere and tracked across increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures, it began extratropical transition, a process the system completed by the following afternoon. However, Rafael's extratropical remnant persisted for another nine days, with the storm looping around a larger extratropical low over the north-central Atlantic, before turning southeastward and then eastward. Rafael's remnant later made landfall on Portugal on October\u00a026, before dissipating later that day. As a disorganized tropical cyclone in the northeastern Caribbean, Rafael produced major flooding across the region. As much as a foot of rain fell across portions of the Lesser Antilles, causing mudslides, landslides, and river flooding. In addition, the heavy rains led to significant crop loss. Sustained winds near hurricane force were recorded on Saint Martin, while tropical storm-force gusts occurred widespread. Lightning activity as a result of heavy thunderstorms caused many fires and power outages. One fatality occurred when a woman in Guadeloupe unsuccessfully attempted to drive her car across a flooded roadway. As Rafael passed just to the east of Bermuda as a hurricane, light rainfall was recorded. Gusts over 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) left hundreds of houses without electricity. Large swells from the system caused significant damage to the coastline of Nova Scotia, while many roads were washed away or obscured with debris, but overall, damage was minimal."

        "content": "The formation of Hurricane Rafael is attributed to a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on October\u00a05. The wave remained disorganized until roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles, at which time a broad area of low pressure developed and convection began to consolidate around it. As a result, the disturbance was introduced into the National Hurricane Center (NHC)'s 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook with a low chance of tropical development.[1] These chances were subsequently raised as further development occurred, with the system receiving a medium chance of development early on October\u00a010,[2] and a high chance of development as it approached the southern Leeward Islands late the following evening.[3] As the wave crossed into the eastern Caribbean Sea and slowed down, the previously broad and open surface low consolidated and became stacked with the mid-level center. The disturbance was already producing tropical storm-force winds,[4] and as a result, skipped tropical depression status to become Tropical Storm Rafael at 1800\u00a0UTC on October\u00a012. At this time, the cyclone was located roughly 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) south-southeast of St. Croix.[5] Despite being named, Rafael remained disorganized initially;[6] this was the result of the interaction between an upper-level trough and the cyclone itself. Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated the center of Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity.[7] Over the course of the next few days, however, the upper-level trough gradually weakened and backed westward, allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical storm. Wind shear lessened, allowing the center to become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system. As it began to execute a turn towards the north under the influence of an upper-level trough to its west, a central dense overcast (CDO) was noted on satellite imagery.[8] Following a series of intensity estimates, Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, while positioned about 650\u00a0mi (1045\u00a0km) south of Bermuda, although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight into the system.[5] As Rafael moved northward, it continued to intensify rapidly, in spite of moderate wind shear. An eye became visible on microwave imagery during the morning hours of October\u00a016, during which time the cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 969\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.61\u00a0inHg). By the afternoon hours of that same day, data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicated that Rafael was on the verge of a weakening trend, attributed to decreasing sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear. Though the system retained hurricane-force winds, it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a017, a process it completed by 1800\u00a0UTC that same day, after interacting with a cold front; at the time of the transition, Rafael was positioned well southwest of Nova Scotia. For the next couple of days, Rafael's remnant accelerated northeastward across the north-central Atlantic Ocean, before proceeding to loop counterclockwise around a larger extratropical low for two days, to the southeast of Greenland, from October\u00a019 to 20. During this time, Rafael's extratropical remnant strengthened even further, with the storm's minimum central pressure bottoming out at 966 millibars (28.5\u00a0inHg) at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a020. Afterward, the cyclone's remnant resumed its eastward motion, meandering towards the southeast for a few days, before turning eastward on October\u00a023, while situated over the Azores. Rafael's extratropical remnant gradually weakened over the next few days, as it moved towards Portugal. Rafael's remnant later made landfall on Portugal on October\u00a026, before dissipating by 1800\u00a0UTC that day.[5]"

        "content": "Shortly after the development of Rafael, a tropical storm watch was issued for the island of Puerto Rico; tropical storm warnings were issued for surrounding locations, including the British and U.S. Virgin Islands. By the morning hours of October 13, the warnings were discontinued for Saint Lucia and Martinique, but issued for Culebra and Vieques. The warnings were discontinued for Guadeloupe and Saint Martin by the pre-dawn hours of the following morning as Rafael pulled away, and expired for the remaining northeastern Caribbean Islands several hours later.[5] In preparation for the system, the Virgin Islands Territorial Management Agency (VITEMA) activated several emergency operation centers across the region, and requested assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), who deployed  a team of workers to cover the aftermath of Rafael. The departments of public works and power authority placed emergency crews on standby, while all ports out of the U.S. Virgin Islands were open to outbound vessel traffic only; the Coast Guard advised mariners to prepare for impending severe weather.[9] As a tropical storm, Rafael hit Guadeloupe with large amounts of rain, causing significant damage to homes and especially crops. According to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, up to 5.9 inches (150\u00a0mm) fell in 3 hours in the prefecture of Basse-Terre, and up to 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) in 48 hours between October\u00a013 and 14; an estimated 7.9 inches (200\u00a0mm) fell during that same timeframe in Grande-Terre.[10] Flooding and mudslides as a result of the heavy rain damaged 60 to 80% of the vegetable crops in Grande-Terre, and lightning as a result of strong storms sparked fires and led to power outages. Sustained winds of 24\u00a0mph (39\u00a0km/h) and gusts reaching 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h) occurred in Raizet; gusts reached 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) in La D\u00e9sirade. A woman was killed in Matouba, part of Saint-Claude, after attempting to drive her car across a flooded roadway; she was swept away.[11] Heavy rains in St. Kitts, amounting to 11.87\u00a0in (301\u00a0mm) in a 30\u2011hour span,[12] caused significant flooding and mudslides, especially around Basseterre. Traffic across the area was paralyzed as roads became impassable, and most businesses were closed for the duration of the storm. Many residents lost power and water supply as well.[13] A few people attempted to drive through flooded roads and required rescue.[12] Numerous weather stations in the French islands of Saint Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my and Saint Martin recorded gusts of 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) and 67\u00a0mph (108\u00a0km/h), respectively. Although several boats were grounded, overall damage remained fairly minor in the French territories. Road 2 between Manati, Puerto Rico and Vega Baja, Puerto Rico was flooded; several houses were also flooded at Toa Alta High.[14]"

This watch was subsequently upgraded to a tropical storm warning the following morning, but was dropped by early on October\u00a017 as the system passed northeast of the island.[5] In advance of the system, residents were urged to take their typical precautionary measures;[15] in addition, the main two airlines on Bermuda\u2014WestJet and United Airlines\u2014cancelled hundreds of flights on October\u00a016.[16] Officials warned of minor storm surge along low-lying coasts,[17] while the Bermuda Weather Service (BWS) warned of two to four inches of rainfall. Winds, while stronger than locals expected, did not cause significant damage.[18] The BWS noted that sustained winds of 34\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h), and gusts reaching 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h), occurred at the L.F. Wade International Airport as the storm made its closest approach;[19] these winds left about 600\u00a0houses without electricity according to the Bermuda Electric Light Company.[18] Rainfall was less than originally feared, peaking at 1.71 inches (43\u00a0mm).[19]"

Near Trepassey, the local breakwater was destroyed in three sections, allowing waves to wash inland.[23] As a result, a 9.1\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) wide and 1.5\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft) deep gap in one of the main roads was left behind. In an area known as the Lower Coast, 50 people were cut off from the surrounding area. Overall damage in the area was estimated at C$1\u20132\u00a0million.[21] Rainfall associated with the storm was light, amounting to 6\u00a0mm (0.24\u00a0in) in Cape Race.[24]"

It burned 41,534 acres (168.08\u00a0km2) inside the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge and burned for three months. The wildlife refuge is located in the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula, where many forest fires are prone to start because of several ecological factors. The area is densely populated by trees, which makes it easy for fires to spread quickly; a layer of shrubs and dead plant material on the ground serve as fuel for fires. Under this layer, the pocosin soil is high in organic material, which acts as a charcoal-like substance that helps fires start.[1] 450 firefighters battled it. 71 high capacity pumps moved billions of gallons of water."

Subsequently, on 17\u00a0November, Numa acquired subtropical characteristics[7] before reaching peak intensity on 18\u00a0November,[2][8] becoming a rare \"medicane\". After making landfall in Greece on 18 November, Numa rapidly weakened, and was later absorbed into another extratropical storm on 20 November.[9] The flooding triggered by Numa became the worst weather event Greece had experienced since 1977,[10] and the storm caused an estimated $100 million (2017 USD) in damages in Europe.[1] The National Observatory of Athens named the system Zenon.[10][11]"

        "content": "On 12 November, the Free University of Berlin named a low-pressure system over the British Isles Numa.[12] Moving southeastward, Numa quickly crossed the southern British Isles, and then France and Italy, before splitting into two low-pressure centres \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Numa I and Numa II \u201a\u00c4\u00ec on 13\u00a0November. Numa II was the stronger of the two, tracking down the centre of the Adriatic Sea, parallel to the Italian coastline and reaching an initial peak intensity of 995\u00a0hPa (29.4\u00a0inHg) on that day.[13] By 14\u00a0November, low-pressure centre Numa I had dissipated, and Numa II dominated the system, and the system was referred to simply as \"Numa,\" while it was located in the open Mediterranean, to the west of Greece.[14] Numa subsequently slowed and turned south, crossing southern Italy and emerging to the north of Sicily, before stalling over the island on 15\u00a0November.[15] Clearing Sicily to the southeast on 16\u00a0November,[16] Numa began to gain subtropical characteristics, while situated off the west coast of Greece, though by 16 November, the system was still extratropical.[16] Around this time, some computer models forecasted that Numa may soon transition into a warm-core subtropical or tropical cyclone, which would bring stronger winds and more flash flooding to Greece if this were to occur.[17] On 17 November, Numa stalled in the Ionian Sea and completely lost its frontal system.[18] On the afternoon of the same day, M\u221a\u00a9t\u221a\u00a9o France tweeted that Numa had attained the status of a subtropical Mediterranean depression.[19] According to ESTOFEX, Numa showed numerous 83-kilometre-per-hour (52\u00a0mph; 45\u00a0kn) flags of 10-minute sustained winds in satellite data.[20] During the next several hours, Numa continued to strengthen, before reaching its peak intensity on 18 November. Between 18:00 UTC on 17 November and 5:00 UTC on 18 November, Numa acquired evident tropical characteristics; between 22:00 UTC on 17 November and 01:00 UTC on 18 November, Numa began to display a hurricane-like structure;[2] ESTOFEX still reported 10-minute sustained winds of 83\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph; 45\u00a0kn) at about this time. Around the time of Numa's peak, the storm had a clear, well-defined eye structure,[8] with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noting an eyewall similar to that of a hurricane's.[7] Satellite ASCAT indicated that the storm had 1-minute sustained winds of 102\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph; 55\u00a0kn), equivalent to tropical storm intensity,[21][22] though the actual winds may have been higher, due to the small diameter of the storm. Later on the same day, Numa made landfall in Greece, producing a storm surge at the Gulf of Patras and damaging wind gusts, before rapidly weakening into a low-pressure area afterward. Subsequently, the system emerged into the Aegean Sea on 19 November.[23] On 20 November, Numa was absorbed into another extratropical storm approaching from the north.[9]"

The fire brigade had received over 600 calls relating to flooding in the days preceding Numa's arrival, dispatching more than 200 firefighters in 55 vehicles to villages across the country to assist.[24] Numa was linked to exceptionally heavy rainfall across the Balkans in mid-November, which lasted for over week, killing at least 21 people in Greece, with Athens being the worst affected area.[25][5][6][10] However, the National Observatory of Athens did not link the flooding to Numa, naming an earlier low which had initiated the flooding Eurydice.[26] The flooding associated with Numa became the deadliest weather event that Greece has experienced since 1977.[10][7] Numa began to bring heavy rainfall to already saturated areas of the Balkans beginning on 15\u00a0November, causing severe flooding, especially in central mainland Greece. By 16\u00a0November, at least 16 people had been killed by flooding in the towns of Mandra, Megara, and Nea Peramos to the west of Athens, with five people missing.[27] Many of those who were killed were elderly residents unable to escape their homes, as floodwaters quickly rose.[24] On 19 November, the death toll in Greece increased to 19, while 3 people still remained missing.[10] On 21 November, the death toll increased to 21, with 1 man still missing.[26] At least 86 people were rescued[25] and at least 37 people were hospitalised across Greece, and more than one third of buildings were destroyed in the town of Nea Peramos, including over 1,000 homes.[24] Thousands of homes were left without electricity or running water after being inundated by more than a metre of floodwater, with the national electricity grid suffering severe damage.[25] More than 20 schools remained closed on 17\u00a0November, with further flooding anticipated, while Numa stalled off the Greek coast.[25] In the aftermath of the flooding, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared three days of national mourning and a state of emergency,[25] saying it was \"the least we can do\". Food, water and blankets were distributed to victims in the worst affected towns.[27] The deputy governor of the worst-affected West Attica region, Yiannis Vassileiou, likened the flooding to Niagara Falls, while mayor of Mandra Yianna Krikouki referred to the flooding as \"biblical\", with the flooding leaving \"nothing standing\" in the town.[24][25] European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Hakan \u221a\u00e1avu\u2248\u00fco\u0192\u00fclu expressed their condolences to the people of Greece, following the tragedy.[25][28] A 364-cabin cruise ship was later opened up as a shelter for those made homeless by the disaster.[27]"

The third tropical cyclone and second named storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry developed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July\u00a024. The wave entered the Caribbean on July\u00a029 and spawned a low-pressure area, which organized into Tropical Storm Barry on August\u00a03. After fluctuations in intensity and track, the storm attained peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) over the Gulf of Mexico. Barry headed northward and moved ashore along the Gulf Coast before degenerating into a remnant low on August\u00a07. On the next day, Barry's remnants dissipated over Missouri. Unlike the devastating Tropical Storm Allison earlier in the season, Barry's effects were moderate. Nine deaths occurred: six in Cuba and three in Florida. As a tropical cyclone, Barry produced heavy rainfall that peaked at 8.9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) at Tallahassee, in Florida. Gusts in the area reached 79\u00a0mph (127\u00a0km/h), which was the highest wind speed recorded for the storm. The precursor tropical wave to Barry dropped large amounts of rain on southern Florida, leading to significant flooding and structural damage. Moderate flooding and wind damage occurred throughout the Florida Panhandle. As the storm's remnants tracked inland, parts of the Mississippi Valley received light precipitation. Barry caused an estimated $30\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD) in damage."

        "content": "On July\u00a024, 2001, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa, and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. Little cyclonic development occurred until July\u00a028, when convection began to increase along the wave. The wave moved into the eastern Caribbean on July\u00a029, and its convection continued to increase while it tracked west-northwest over the subsequent few days. The disturbance emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a01, with rainfall noted over southern Florida and the western tip of Cuba. That same day, a broad low-pressure system developed along the wave near the Dry Tortugas at the end of the Florida Keys, which began to intensify as it moved northwestward. At around 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a02, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating the system discovered that the low had organized into a tropical storm, which received the name Barry. Post-hurricane season reanalysis, however, revealed that the low had become a tropical depression six hours earlier. There is uncertainty as to whether Barry actually held tropical characteristics at the time of designation, because of an upper-level low that was situated over the cyclone's surface center.[1] When Barry became a tropical cyclone, its convection wrapped around roughly half of the center. Outflow in the eastern semicircle was good, although due to upper-level wind shear, it was restricted to southeast of the circulation.[2] The cyclone became embedded within a mid- to-upper-level trough between the ridge over the central U.S. and the ridge over the northwestern Caribbean. A strong, upper-level cyclonic shear axis extended from just south of Cape Hatteras to near Brownsville, Texas, which prevented Barry from accelerating in forward speed.[3] The ridge over the United States weakened, thus collapsing the steering pattern; this resulted in a west-southwestward drifting motion of the tropical storm by around August 3.[1] Early on August 3, strong westerly winds prevailed, and separated the center of circulation from what limited convection remained.[4] The storm quickly regained some convection, although maximum sustained winds remained weak, at about 40\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h).[5] Despite a slight drop in barometric pressure, post-season analysis revealed Barry weakened into a tropical depression early on August 4 due to the persistent wind shear and falling external pressure.[1] At 1800\u00a0UTC on August 4, the cyclone re-intensified slightly, and was upgraded to a tropical storm[1] as the shear decreased.[6] Early on August 5, a strengthening period began as deep convection ignited over and near the low-level center.[7] Prior to landfall, banding features developed on the eastern half of the circulation, despite some residual westerly shear.[8] Within seven hours, the barometric pressure dropped from 1004\u00a0mb to 990\u00a0mb and overall satellite presentation had begun to improve. Barry reached its peak intensity at 1800\u00a0UTC on August 5 with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), just shy of hurricane status.[1] An eye formed at around the same time. At 0500 UTC on August 6, Barry increased in forward speed and made landfall at Santa Rosa Beach, Florida with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[9] Moving inland, the system weakened rapidly to a tropical depression; the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the storm early on August 6.[10] By the evening hours, maximum sustained winds near the center were around 5\u00a0mph (8.0\u00a0km/h) to 10\u00a0mph (16\u00a0km/h), as the system slowed significantly and drifted northwest at about 7\u00a0mph (11\u00a0km/h).[11] The depression turned northwestward, and steadily weakened to a remnant low near Memphis, Tennessee on August 7, and the remnant low dissipated on August 8, over southeastern Missouri.[1]"

They were upgraded to a hurricane warning when the storm was predicted to reach hurricane intensity. Because that strengthening failed to occur, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning shortly before landfall. Westward, the warnings for Louisiana and Mississippi were discontinued. After Tropical Storm Barry made landfall, all tropical storm warnings for the Florida Panhandle were discontinued.[1] Flood warnings were issued for parts of Leon and Wakulla counties, while a flash flood watch was in effect for parts of southern Georgia.[11] A tornado watch was issued for the eastern Florida Panhandle, southern Georgia, as well as portions of central and eastern Alabama.[12] As Barry approached the Florida Panhandle, voluntary evacuations took place in eight counties.[13] Shelters opened in six counties, though most were placed on standby. In parts of Franklin County, mandatory evacuations were ordered, and in Okaloosa County, tolls on the Mid-Bay Bridge were suspended.[14] Forty C-130 cargo aircraft and about 300 personnel from Hurlburt Field were moved to the Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas to flee the storm's projected path. In Tallahassee, county officials filled sandbags in areas vulnerable to flooding.[13] At Grand Isle State Park, park rangers moved picnic tables out of tidal range and closed the camping grounds for a period of time.[15] Additionally, the storm forced NASA to delay a shuttle launch in southern Florida. Elsewhere, thousands of personnel were evacuated from several offshore oil platforms.[16] The city of New Orleans closed 60 of its 72 floodgates to avoid possible flooding.[17] Throughout southeastern Louisiana, including New Orleans, roughly 500\u00a0Red Cross volunteers and staff members were on standby.[16] The threat of the storm forced the cancellation of an 'N Sync concert at Pro Player Stadium.[18]"

Offshore, high seas sank a Cuban refugee boat, drowning 6 of its 28\u00a0passengers.[1] Three people in Florida were killed by the storm, and total damage is estimated at around 30\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD).[19] In southern Florida, the precursor to Barry produced 3\u00a0in (75\u00a0mm) to 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm), with rainfall peaking at 13\u00a0in (330\u00a0mm). The rain helped relieve persistent drought conditions;[1] however, it caused significant flooding in Martin County on August 2, where a total of 300\u00a0homes received water damage. About 63\u00a0structures and 6\u00a0mobile homes in the county sustained major damage.[20] In the Treasure Coast, catfish reportedly swam through flooded streets.[21] Winds downed a 60\u00a0ft (18\u00a0m) radio tower, striking a house.[22] Due to the initial slow movement of the storm, outer rainbands began affecting the Florida Panhandle on August 4, with the heaviest rainfall observed on August 5\u20136. The storm dropped 5\u00a0in (125\u00a0mm) to 9\u00a0in (225\u00a0mm); the highest official report was 8.9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) at Tallahassee, though unofficial reports ranged as high as 11\u00a0in (175\u00a0mm).[1] The rainfall inundated several structures in Bay County due to roof damage. Flooding occurred in Leon County and parts of Apalachicola National Forest, where torrential rains flowed into the Cascade Lakes, Lake Bradford and Munson Slough; the Munson Slough rose to its highest level since 1994. Numerous county and secondary roads were closed by floodwater in Walton, Washington, and Bay counties,[19] as well as in the Tallahassee area.[23] In and around Tallahassee, 100\u00a0vehicles were stalled by flood waters and towed, while four residents of an apartment complex on Allen Road were forced to evacuate due to rising waters.[24] Sporadic flooding also occurred in Franklin County and Wakulla County.[25] An indirect death occurred from a traffic accident due to heavy rain in Jackson County.[1] Wind gusts peaked at 79\u00a0mph (127\u00a0km/h) at the Eglin Air Force Base Range Station C-72.[1] Light to moderate winds were widespread, causing damage throughout Walton, Washington, Bay, Calhoun, Gulf and Okaloosa counties.[26] Trees were downed or damaged, and several structures suffered light wind damage.[27] Window damage was reported at a high-rise condominium building in Destin, while nearby, the Mid-Bay Bridge was closed due to high winds.[28] The Freeport Elementary School in Walton County sustained minor roof damage.[23][29] Storm surge was generally light, ranging from 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) to 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m), with only minor beach erosion as a result.[26] As a tropical system, Barry spawned a few weak tornadoes that caused minor damage. In an outer rain band, a lightning strike in Jacksonville killed one person. Another death is blamed on a rip current off of Sanibel Island.[1] In total, the storm left 34,000\u00a0customers in the state without power.[28]"

Damage to awnings and small structures was reported in Florala.[36] Barry's remnants produced light rainfall across Mississippi and Georgia, though no damage was reported.

On receipt of the second message, the Fenland District Council was notified immediately.

An alert for the coastal area to the East and South of Mundesley was issued at 1150 hours and a warning at 1810 hours.

It was estimated that \u00a31,600,000 (1978) worth of damage was caused to private property and goods in Cleethorpes. One of the big differences between 1978 and the storm surge during the Gale of January 1976 in the town, was that damage occurred much further inland. Damage was reported up to three-quarters of a mile away from the sea wall.[9] In Cleethorpes the damage spread over an area of 5\u00a0km2 (1.9\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in total.[1] The railway between Grimsby and Cleethorpes was left inoperable as the ballast was washed out from under the track.[8] Further south on the Lincolnshire coast the resorts of Sandilands and Mablethorpe saw 28 homes and 8 business premises left underwater, with caravans and chalets along the Lincolnshire coast damaged.[1] In Boston, Lincolnshire following the failure of a brick retaining wall, St Botolph's Church and 180 houses were flooded.[1] Waters in the church exceeded the levels seen in 1953.[10] In Sutton Bridge Wharf Street and Customhouse Street flooded as water overflowed the banks of the River Nene.[11]"

The costs of damage in King's Lynn though were less than during 1953 flood.[22] The storm surge breached the shingle ridge to the south of Heacham and the sea wall at Heacham North Beach, resulting in significant damage to property.[23] Hundreds of caravans near to Snettisham and Hunstanton were overturned by the storm.[13] With damage to caravans also occurring in Wolferton.[24] In Wells-next-the-Sea two major breaches occurred, flooding the adjacent marshes, damaging beach huts and grounding a 300-ton coaster on Wells quay car park.[1][24] The storm washed away over \u00bd mile (800 m) of track of the Wells Harbour Railway.[25] Severe flooding was reported at Walcott.[1] Though no major flooding was reported in Great Yarmouth. Along the coast in Suffolk, Lowestoft reported no major flooding, but noted increased erosion of cliffs around Benacre, Suffolk and Covehithe during the event. In Southwold the pavilion and some beach huts along the esplanade were damaged.[1] 25 properties flooded in Aldeburgh and 40 properties were reported as flooded in Felixstowe.[26] Major storm damage to the hamlet of Felixstowe Ferry was reported, with cars destroyed, boats stranded and houseboats damaged. with the next high tide due at 2.30 there were fears that the promenade and homes could flood, a full-scale emergency response was put into action, filling sandbags to stop the flood entering homes on the sea front.[27] In Essex, Harwich and Dovercourt saw parts of the town quay and approach roads flooded.[28] South Essex was sheltered from the main force of wind, with some breaches in rural locations, but compared to 1953 damages were light."

No residential or business property was reported as being flooded.[35] The storm brought considerable damage to the Seaview Caravan and Chalet Park in Swalecliffe due to overtopping of the sea defences.[30] There was also damage from overtopping of flood defences at Pegwell Bay, between Ramsgate and Sandwich on the east coast of Kent.[36] Flooding was also reported to the northwest and southeast of Sandwich, Kent.[37] Families were evacuated by boat from Deal, Kent.[38] Coastal flooding continued around the Kent coast into the English Channel with water coming over the top of sea defences at St Mary's Bay, Kent on Romney Marsh.[39]"

The shoreward end amusement arcade survived, along with one set of piles.[41] The iron legs of Hunstanton pier were found later washed up 8\u00a0km to the south.[1] The Southwold Pier was damaged.[1] Herne Bay Pier saw the main deck destroyed leaving only a short section intact and the pier-head isolated out at sea.[42] Margate jetty (to distinguish from stone harbour walls) which had been closed since 1976 because of safety issues was virtually destroyed by the 11 January 1978 storm surge isolating the lifeboat station.[43] Following the storm the RAF air sea rescue Wessex helicopter from Manston, landed some of the lifeboat crew onto the station and after checking for damage to the lifeboat slipway, the boat was launched and taken to Ramsgate."

Trailheads, trails, and camping in North Cascades National Park remained closed after the road reopened on August 9.[18] The highway was closed again due to the fire's growth as well as the formation of the Blue Lake Fire.[19] Smoke from this fire and other fires in inland Washington and British Columbia was pushed towards Western Washington and rapid convective mixing caused unhealthy air quality in Seattle on August 20\u201321.[20][21] The Gray Fire was ignited on August 18 near Medical Lake in Spokane County and grew to over 9,500 acres (3,800\u00a0ha) within a day. It prompted the evacuation of Medical Lake and parts of Cheney and shut down portions of Interstate 90 and State Route 902.[22] One death was determined to be from the Gray Fire while another was caused by the nearby Oregon Road Fire.[23] The Oregon Fire began on the same day as the Gray Fire, August 18.

According to Garc\u00eda, in addition to the never-published material developed for The World of Ice & Fire, Martin also created entirely new material for the book, having \"worked on just fleshing out a bit\" the long reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, which was previously only mentioned in \"Heirs of the Dragon\", an unpublished text that Martin abridged to form the novelette The Rogue Prince.[6] On July 22, 2017, Martin revealed on his blog that the material for Fire & Blood had grown so large that the decision had been made to publish the histories of the Targaryen kings in two volumes. The first volume, simply called Fire & Blood, covers the history of Westeros from Aegon's Conquest up to and through the regency of the boy king, Aegon III Targaryen. While the first volume of Fire & Blood has been published, the second volume was largely unwritten as of July 2017.[7] In April 2018, when announcing the publication date, Martin revealed the manuscript to be 989 pages long.[1] An excerpt was revealed in October 2018.[8]"

About 90 victims from 28 families were evacuated to a relief centre in Ringlet.[5] This was the second time that mud floods of this magnitude had ravaged the Bertam Valley since the 2013 mud floods. The mud floods had been largely attributed to illegal land clearing by foreign illegal immigrants who were involved in the rapidly expanding agricultural industry there.[6] Pahang Sultan Ahmad Shah has orders to stop the illegal farming and there is a claim of corruption involving the illegal land clearing.[7][8]"

Rail communications between Gujarat and Bombay State were cut off, only being restored after a month. Floods was also reported in parts of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana. It also intensified the annual monsoon season in these regions.[1]"

On July 19, a deluge of rain hit the Johnstown area during the night. Nearly 12 inches (300 millimetres) of rain fell in 24 hours when a thunderstorm stalled over the region, and six dams in the area over-topped and failed. The largest dam to fail was the Laurel Run Dam, releasing over 101\u00a0million U.S. gallons (380,000 cubic meters) of water that poured through the village of Tanneryville, killing 41 people. The combination of the other five dams[2] released another 27\u00a0million US gallons (100,000\u00a0m3), not counting the water from rains. Well over 128\u00a0million US gallons (480,000\u00a0m3) of water from the dams alone poured down the valley, and by dawn Johnstown was inundated with six feet (1.8\u00a0m) of water. The channel improvements were designed to carry 81,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (2,310\u00a0m3/s), but the 1977 flood discharge was measured as 115,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (3,300\u00a0m3/s).[3] Ron Shawley, executive director of Laurel Highland's Historical Village, returned to Johnstown on July 20 and stated \"It was like somebody dropped an atomic bomb on Johnstown\" and that \"I questioned what kind of force it would take to do that.\"[4]"

In 1936, while the U.S. Congress was debating flood control bills, heavy snow run-off and three days of continuous rainfall caused the Saint Patrick's Day flood of 1936. After this, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers undertook a study with the aim of redesigning Johnstown's infrastructure to permanently remove any future threat of serious flooding. On April 27, 1937, Congress passed sweeping flood control legislation and in August 1938 work began with extensive dredging and other flood control measures. On November 27, 1943, the Johnstown Channel Improvement Project was declared complete, with 9.1 miles (14.6 km) of improvements that included the Conemaugh, Stonycreek, and Little Conemaugh Rivers.[6] Colonel Gilbert Van B. Wilkes, Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, told a Johnstown audience the flood problems had been effectively solved. The city's residents began to feel secure that any flooding issues had been resolved and even promoted the area as \"flood free\" for many years. However, the Corps of Engineers had designed the flood control measures for protection against a standard project flood; protection to the level necessary to control a 500-year flood was not economically viable. In 1974, the Corps issued a report titled \"The Potential for Future Flooding in the Johnstown Area\", which failed to grasp the attentions of town leaders and the people of Johnstown."

This dam had a 42+1\u20442-foot-high (13.0\u00a0m) spillway, and when it failed about 101\u00a0million US gallons (380,000\u00a0m3) of water was released. After the dam failed, water rushed through the Tanneryville neighborhood. The Sandy Run Dam, a 28-foot-high (8.5\u00a0m), 63-year-old earthen dam with a spillway owned by the Highland Water and Sewer Authority, released a little more than 18\u00a0million US gallons (68,000\u00a0m3) of water when it failed, with its flood waters entering the Conemaugh between St. Michael and South Fork at Ehrenfeld. The Salix Water Dam on Otto Run, owned by the Adams Township Water Authority, was a 25-foot-high (7.6\u00a0m) earthen dam that held 2\u00a0million US gallons (7,600\u00a0m3) of water. When the dam failed, the flood waters ran into the South Fork Little Conemaugh River which joins the Conemaugh River in Sidman. The Cambria Slope Mine #33, on Sanders Run, had a spillway height of 32\u00a0ft (9.8\u00a0m) and was leased by the Bethlehem Mines Corporation, and held 7\u00a0million US gallons (26,000\u00a0m3) of water. Sanders Run flows adjacent to and joins Howells Run, skirting Ebensburg and draining into City Reservoir. The dam was a total failure.[7] An unnamed dam on Peggy's Run, Franklin Borough, was leased to Bethlehem Mines Corporation.

However, dry air quickly entered the system, causing it to rapidly weaken to a depression just off the coast of Gujarat, India. Over the following several days, the system took a slow, erratic track towards the south-southeast. After turning northeastward, the system made landfall near Porbandar on October\u00a010 and dissipated shortly thereafter. Throughout southeastern Pakistan and northwestern India, thousands of residents were evacuated prior to the cyclone's arrival. In these areas, the storm produced moderate to heavy rainfall, peaking at 145\u00a0mm (5.7\u00a0in) in Thatta, Sindh, Pakistan. These rains led to flash flooding in several areas. Nine people died in several incidents related to the storm in Karachi. The drainage system of Hyderabad sustained significant damage, leading to several protests and demonstrations by city residents. Offshore, 300 fishermen are believed to have gone missing during the storm; no reports have confirmed their whereabouts since they disappeared."

        "content": "Severe Cyclonic Storm Onil was first identified as an area of convection early on September\u00a030, 2004 situated roughly 465\u00a0km (290\u00a0mi) southwest of Mumbai, India. Satellite imagery depicted a poorly organized system with deep convection partially surrounding a low-level circulation. Situated over warm water and within an area of moderate wind shear,[1] the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system's chances of developing into a tropical cyclone as \"fair\".[2] Within several hours of being identified, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began monitoring the system as Depression ARB 03.[3] Despite a decrease in convection later on September\u00a030,[1] the IMD upgraded the cyclone to a deep depression, stating that three-minute sustained winds had reached 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph).[3] Early the next day, organization substantially improved,[1] prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[2] Around 0900\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01, the IMD upgraded the deep depression to Cyclonic Storm Onil.[3] Upon being named, the storm became the first tropical cyclone on record to be named in the northern Indian Ocean. The WMO/ESCAP Panel agreed in May 2004 that in September, tropical cyclones in the Northern Indian Ocean attaining gale-force winds would be given names.[4] Later on October\u00a01, the JTWC issued their first advisory on the storm, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 03A.[2] Tracking towards the northeast, Onil intensified as convection consolidated around the center of circulation.[1] Roughly 24\u00a0hours after being named, the system attained its peak intensity as a severe cyclonic storm with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23\u00a0inHg) according to the IMD with.[3] Upon reaching this strength, the system featured a pinhole eye surrounded by deep convection. Additionally, Dvorak technique intensity estimates reached 3.5, indicating a high-end tropical storm. However, the JTWC stated maximum winds to be 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), a low-end tropical storm.[2] As the storm neared the Indian coastline, dry air quickly entered the circulation, causing most of the convection associated with Onil to dissipate.[1] Located within 100\u00a0km (65\u00a0mi) of land, the JTWC downgraded the system to a tropical depression and the IMD downgraded Onil to a deep depression.[2][3] On October\u00a03, the center of Onil skimmed the coastline of northwestern India; however, the center did not cross land.[1] Around this time, the upper-level circulation detached from the low-level circulation, further weakening the storm.[2] Early on October\u00a04, the JTWC stated that the system had degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure system.[5] After executing a counter-clockwise loop, the depression slowly tracked south-southeastward, away from land. By October\u00a07, the system was reclassified as a tropical depression by the JTWC as it stalled several hundred kilometres southwest of Gujarat, India. The system maintained a relatively low intensity for the following several days before making landfall near Porbandar with winds of 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph).[5] Within hours of moving inland, Onil dissipated early on October\u00a010.[2]"

        "content": "In northwestern India, thousands of residents were evacuated in fears of Onil striking the region. According to one of the evacuated residents, this was the seventh evacuation due to a cyclone in the area since 1999.[6] On October\u00a010, the storm's remnants brought light to moderate rainfall in India; there was no known rainfall amount exceeding 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) throughout the region.[1] In southeastern Pakistan, an estimated 6,000 people were evacuated from coastal regions prior to Cyclone Onil's arrival.[1] Port officials warned fishermen not to venture out during the storm due to rough seas.[7] Cyclone Onil brought moderate to heavy rainfall and gusty winds. A maximum of 145\u00a0mm (5.7\u00a0in) of rain fell in Thatta, Sindh between October\u00a02 and 3.[1] In Hyderabad, heavy rains amounting to 98\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) caused a 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) section of a drainage system to collapse, prompting the evacuation of several hundred residents.[8][9][10] Throughout Sindh, an estimated 607 square kilometres (234\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land was inundated by flood waters, destroying roughly 70% of the cotton crop.[11] In the city of Karachi, nine people were killed in various incidents related to the storm at least 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) winds were reported. Two people were killed after being electrocuted by a downed power line outside their home. Many streets in the city were flooded and power lines were downed.[12] Another one of these people died while trying to clear a drain near her house when a wall collapsed on her.[13] Offshore, 163 fishermen were reported to be missing after being caught in the storm.[14] However, reports from Pakistani officials stated that at least 300 fishermen were missing.[8] In other areas, power was lost for more than 48\u00a0hours after Onil moved through the region.[15] Around Karo Gongro, 100 people were stranded along a major roadway after flash flooding struck the area.[16] In the wake of the storm, Pakistani officials set up 26 relief camps where residents were offered food and shelter.[15] Roughly 3,000 people sought refuge in these shelters.[11] Mobile units were also set up by the District Health Department to minimize the impacts of any post-storm diseases.[15] On October\u00a03, Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh expressed his grief over the damage caused by Cyclonic Storm Onil and stated that he would be touring the affected region within the following days.[17] At least 40\u00a0million Pakistani rupee ($469,000\u00a0USD) was allocated in relief funds by Sindh Minister Syed Papoo Shah.[8] On October\u00a04, port officials stated that it was safe for fishermen to resume their activities in the Arabian Sea.[18] Later that day, a rain emergency was declared for Hyderabad and emergency shelters were set up in the city. All officers in the Hyderabad Development Authority who were initially put on leave ahead of the cyclone were told to resume work to assist in clearing drainage systems.[19] Several days after the storm, reports indicated that there were more than 300 instances where the city's drainage system collapsed across the area, resulting in standing water in many structures. Residents in these areas, frustrated by the lack of quick action by the government, began holding protests about the flooding. In response to these protests, Shaukat Hayat Bhutto suspended Assistant Engineer Sewage manager, Qamar Memon, for his negligence on draining flood waters.[20]"

Those who did wake attempted to take refuge on the roofs of their huts but most of the huts were destroyed by the floodwater. Those who climbed onto the roof of the cookhouse survived even though it partially collapsed. About 11 men took refuge in one of the work trucks but the waters overturned it and they were swept away. One bonnet of a vehicle was eventually found 12 kilometres (7.5\u00a0mi) downstream.[1][4] No. 2 camp was about 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) further downstream where 47 more workers were staying. Fortunately, the alarm was raised early enough for them to reach higher ground. The only other casualty in the area was a man at Boyd's Camp by the Maraetaha Stream at the Gisborne end of the railway line.[4] The rain gauges in the Kopuawhara area had registered 8 inches of rain the day before the disaster and 20 inches within 10 hours prior to the flash flood.[5] The flow in the Waiau stream was calculated as having reached 33,900 cusecs.

        "content": "On December\u00a015, an area of low pressure was identified over the southern Andaman Sea. Remaining nearly stationary,[22] it gradually developed into a depression two days later.[23] Despite being at a low latitude of 5\u00b0N, favorable conditions allowed the system to steadily strengthen, attaining hurricane-force winds by December\u00a019.[22] Spanning approximately 965\u00a0km (600\u00a0mi), the cyclone reached its peak intensity on December\u00a021 as it approached Ceylon.[23] Based on satellite imagery, it was estimated that the storm had peak winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), with gusts as high as 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph).[23] This ranked the system as a modern-day super cyclonic storm.[24] Weakening somewhat, the system continued westward, moving over Tamil Nadu, before rapidly weakening. The system degenerated into a remnant low after emerging over the Arabian Sea on December\u00a024 and dissipated two days later.[22] Striking Ceylon as a super cyclonic storm, the storm wrought tremendous damage. Winds well in excess of hurricane-force battered the region for over six hours, destroying more than 5,000\u00a0homes.[22][25] In eastern Rameswaram, a passenger train carrying 115\u00a0people was swept away by a 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) surge, killing all on board.[25] Nearly every structure in Dhanushkodi was destroyed.[22] Press reports indicated that as many as 2,000\u00a0people died on Ceylon, including 350\u00a0fishermen offshore. In Tamil Nadu, an estimated 500\u00a0people were killed. Damage from the storm amounted to $150\u00a0million.[25]"

        "content": " Hurricane Hugo was a powerful tropical cyclone that inflicted widespread destruction across the northeastern Caribbean and the Southeastern United States in September 1989. The eleventh tropical cyclone, eighth named storm, sixth hurricane, and second major hurricane[a] of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season, Hugo arose from a cluster of thunderstorms near Cape Verde on September 10, 1989. This cluster coalesced into a tropical depression and strengthened into Tropical Storm Hugo as it tracked west across the Atlantic Ocean for several days. On September\u00a013, Hugo became a hurricane and continued to intensify through September\u00a015 when its sustained winds peaked at 160\u00a0mph (255\u00a0km/h), making it a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Between September\u00a017 and\u00a021, Hugo made landfall on Guadeloupe, Saint Croix, Puerto Rico, and lastly South Carolina, with major hurricane strength winds. The storm weakened inland and accelerated north over the Eastern United States, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a023 before it was last noted in the far northern Atlantic on September\u00a025. Hugo left extensive damage in its wake, causing 67\u00a0deaths and $11\u00a0billion (equivalent to $27\u00a0billion in 2023) in damage, which at the time, made it the costliest hurricane on record.[b] Guadeloupe bore the brunt of the storm in the Leeward Islands. Three thousand houses were unroofed, contributing to the displacement of 35,000\u00a0people from their homes. Hugo was Montserrat's costliest hurricane on record and brought down the island's entire power grid. Ninety percent of homes on the island suffered significant to total roof loss after the island was struck by the eyewall. The hurricane's impacts continued into the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, causing over $1\u00a0billion in damage. Wind gusts up to 168\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h) were measured in Saint Croix, where property damage exceeded $500\u00a0million with over 90\u00a0percent of buildings damaged; three people were killed on the island. Widespread damage occurred in Puerto Rico and much of the island suffered power and water service failures. Eight people were killed in Puerto Rico and nearly 28,000\u00a0people were left homeless. In the United States, coastal South Carolina was hit by record setting storm surge heights, reaching 20.2\u00a0ft (6.2\u00a0m) near  McClellanville. The surge and strong winds wrought extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure across South Carolina, and caused 13 deaths. Flood and wind impacts followed Hugo across much of the Eastern United States into Eastern Canada. There were widespread and significant agricultural impacts from Hugo. Guadeloupe sustained damage to the entirety of its banana crop and most of its coconut palms and sugar cane crop. Habitat loss caused bat populations in Montserrat to fall 20-fold, while the populations of several endemic bird species declined or were disrupted across the eastern Caribbean. Coastal bird populations in South Carolina were forced 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) inland. Additionally, forests between South Carolina and Virginia were heavily damaged; in South Carolina alone the loss of timber was estimated at $1.04\u00a0billion. Hugo was the strongest hurricane to strike the northeastern Caribbean since Hurricane David in 1979, and the strongest to make landfall on the continental U.S. since Hurricane Camille in 1969. The scale of the hurricane's impacts led to the retirement of the name Hugo from the Atlantic tropical cyclone name list."

        "content": "Hurricane Hugo was a Cape Verde hurricane that developed from a cluster of thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave first observed moving off the coast of Africa on September\u00a09, near Cape Verde.[7] (part of that same wave would later spawn Hurricane Raymond in the eastern Pacific).[8] A tropical depression developed from this disturbance roughly 125\u00a0mi (200\u00a0km) south of Cape Verde the following day.[9] The nascent cyclone intensified as it tracked west along the 12th parallel north and across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, reaching tropical storm strength on September\u00a011, and hurricane strength on September\u00a013, while located about 1,265\u00a0mi (2,035\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands. The presence of another area of low-pressure north of Puerto Rico produced a gap in the Azores High, causing Hugo to then gradually turn towards the west-northwest with its forward speed decelerating.[7] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on September 15, the first aircraft reconnaissance mission to probe Hugo reported that it had intensified to a Category\u00a05 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central barometric pressure of 918\u00a0mbar (27.11\u00a0inHg), which turned out to be its peak intensity.[7] Still several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands at the time, this made Hugo the easternmost Category\u00a05 hurricane on record in the Atlantic.[c][10] Its winds tapered as it approached the Caribbean; at 05:00\u00a0UTC on September 17, Hugo's eye passed over Guadeloupe with sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h). The next day, the hurricane made three landfalls, first on Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, with sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h), followed by Vieques and Fajardo in Puerto Rico, with sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) in each instance.[7] Hugo's encounter with Puerto Rico weakened the storm substantially, its eye became ill-defined in satellite imagery and its winds had diminished to around 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019. However, the hurricane's return to open waters provided suitable conditions for reintensification.[7][9] By this juncture, the broader weather patterns that steered Hugo had changed: the Azores High became a dominant influence north of the hurricane and an upper-level low emerged over Georgia.[7] These two features generated a strong southeasterly steering flow within which Hugo was contained, shaping its trajectory towards the Southeastern United States. As the hurricane accelerated away from Puerto Rico at about 14\u00a0mph (22\u00a0km/h), it became better organized and its eye became increasingly well defined.[9] On September 21, Hugo passed over the Gulf Stream and intensified markedly over a period of 30 hours, re-strengthening to a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[7][9] At 04:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a022, Hugo made its last landfall landfall on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, with sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h). Hugo's forward motion was beginning to accelerate northward at the time in response to an extratropical cyclone moving across the central U.S., and this curvature and acceleration continued as Hugo moved farther inland.[7] The intensity of the winds decreased after landfall, particularly as Hugo began interacting with the Appalachian Mountains; by dawn on September 22, Hugo was downgraded to a tropical storm when it was just west of Charlotte, North Carolina.[7][9] The next day, it transitioned into an extratropical storm near Erie, Pennsylvania, and continued across eastern Canada, eventually moving into the far northern Atlantic where it was last noted on September\u00a025.[7]"

        "content": "Between September 15 and September 22, aircraft from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) penetrated the eye of Hugo 76\u00a0times, documenting the location of the storm's center roughly once every two hours.[7] Among these planes was a WP-3D Orion serviced by the NOAA and nicknamed Kermit (callsign N42RF).[11][12] It had been deployed to Barbados alongside another WP-3D Orion as part of a research experiment coordinated by the Hurricane Research Division.[12] While penetrating the storm at an altitude of 1,500\u00a0ft (460\u00a0m), the plane encountered extreme turbulence and sustained winds of 190\u00a0mph (310\u00a0km/h), indicating a storm more intense than satellite estimates suggested.[13] Flight data showed that the plane likely encountered a mesovortex comparable to a weak tornado spanning a kilometer across.[12][14] One of Kermit's four engines overheated within the hurricane's eyewall, prompting its shutdown that caused the plane to quickly lose altitude as it entered the eye. The pilots regained control when the plane reached an altitude of 790\u00a0ft (240\u00a0m) at 17:28\u00a0UTC.[12][11] To avoid overworking the three remaining engines, the pilots orbited the center of Hugo for an hour within the 9-mile-wide (14\u00a0km) eye while bringing the plane to a gradual ascent. Fuel was also ejected from Kermit's lower fuselage. The plane climbed to an altitude of 7,200\u00a0ft (2,200\u00a0m) before departing the eye via the northeast eyewall and returning to Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados.[12]"

The watch was escalated to a hurricane warning three hours later. Concurrent watches and warnings for tropical storm conditions were in effect for Saint Vincent and Barbados. These initial alerts were discontinued following the storm's passage by September 18. A hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on September 15; this was superseded by a hurricane warning the following day that in turn was lifted on September 19. As Hugo tracked northwest across the Sargasso Sea between September 19\u201320, tropical storm warnings were issued for coastal areas of the Dominican Republic and The Bahamas. The NHC first issued hurricane watches for portions of the East Coast of the United States on September 20, escalating to a hurricane warning for some coastal areas on September 21. The coverage of these watches and warnings were incrementally revised leading up to Hugo's final landfall; at their greatest extent, hurricane watches were in effect between St. Augustine, Florida, and the Chesapeake Bay, while hurricane warnings were in effect between Fernandina Beach, Florida, and Oregon Inlet in North Carolina. All tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued by 16:00\u00a0UTC on September 22.[7]"

        "content": "Barbados served as a staging area for disaster response in the Caribbean due to its strategic position in the region and distance away from Hugo's forecast impacts.[16] Several relief agencies had convened in Barbados earlier in 1989 to coordinate hurricane response plans. These agencies were mobilized ahead of Hugo's arrival in the Lesser Antilles. They were joined by additional teams from the United States Agency for International Development and the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). Additional relief teams from the OFDA, Pan American Health Organization, Red Cross, and United Nations Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator were pre-positioned in Antigua to survey the damage and prioritize aid in Hugo's aftermath.[17]:\u200a1\u200a Civil defense officials in Dominica and Guadeloupe prepared shelters to house evacuees. Non-critical patients at Princess Margaret Hospital in Roseau, Dominica were sent home beginning on September 15 to free space for possible hurricane victims. The government of Dominica urged its citizens to take emergency precautions. The Dominican Ministry of Public Works prepositioned earthmoving equipment around Dominica to clear landslide debris. A curfew in Guadeloupe mandating that streets be clear of pedestrians and vehicles came into effect at 6\u00a0p.m. AST on September 17. Leading up to the curfew, residents rushed hardware stores and supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Many on the Atlantic-facing side of Guadeloupe evacuated farther inland.[5] Cable television played a significant role in keeping residents of Martinique updated on the hurricane's approach.[15] Though no formal evacuation order was enacted for Martinique, the prefect of Martinique recommended the evacuation of the low-lying Kinsale area on September 16. Twenty-four evacuation shelters were opened throughout the island.[18] Disaster preparedness plans were set into motion by Martinique's government ministries, dispatching crews to board windows and secure buildings.[19] Air France cancelled its three Martinique-bound flights from Paris scheduled for September 18;[5] flights to the Lesser Antilles were largely cancelled by the afternoon of September 16. Most buildings in Antigua were shuttered by noon on September 17 and all local ships were brought to their moorings. V. C. Bird International Airport closed and the island's electric grid was turned off.[5][20] Across both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, 217\u00a0shelters were opened; over 161,000\u00a0people sought refuge in these shelters.[21] Although warnings from the NHC afforded ample time for preparations, shelters were required to be provisioned longer than in typical hurricanes.[22] Some of these shelters took heavy damage during Hugo, and one required evacuation by civil defense authorities after its windows gave way to the wind.[23] Shelters in Saint Croix housed 1,000\u00a0evacuees.[24] Operations at Cyril E. King Airport in Saint Thomas were suspended on the afternoon of September 17.[25] Banks, courts, government offices, and schools were also closed throughout the region.[26] Evacuations in Puerto Rico began at dawn on September 17 and were completed in eight hours.[23] Most of the 166\u00a0shelters opened in Puerto Rico were public schools.[27] More than 2,000\u00a0troops from the United States National Guard were mobilized in Puerto Rico;[28] in San Juan, National Guardsmen and volunteers drove around the city issuing emergency instructions over loudspeakers.[24] At least 30,000\u00a0people evacuated in Puerto Rico, making it one of the largest evacuations in the territory's history; government and media representatives described the evacuation as \"the best coordinated weather event they could recall.\"[29][21] Three thousand people evacuated from southeastern Puerto Rico and five thousand evacuated from San Juan neighborhoods.[30] However, many were initially reluctant to leave.[31] La Perla was evacuated for the first time in living memory.[32] Hundreds of evacuees were brought to a stadium in Mayag\u00fcez.[24] The Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport terminated all scheduled flights at 6\u00a0p.m. AST on September 17. All international airlines evacuated their aircraft from Puerto Rico, though one Airbus A300 owned by American Airlines was left behind for emergency use.[24] Tourists left en masse on departing flights before the airport terminated operations.[33] Cruise ships with San Juan as their port of call were rerouted elsewhere. One person was killed in Utuado, Puerto Rico, after being electrocuted by a power line while preparing for the storm.[24][6]:\u200aA5\u200a On September 18, Puerto Rican Governor Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n ordered a shutdown of the island's electric grid to mitigate damage.[27] A state of emergency was declared in the Dominican Republic on September 18.[34]:\u200a1A\u200a Four international airports were closed that day and businesses began to fortify against Hugo's effects. Civil defense officials aided preparations in Puerto Plata and evacuated a beach there.[35]:\u200a14A\u200a A Boeing 727 charter evacuated 135\u00a0vacationers from the city.[36]:\u200aA-1"

        "content": "Hugo was the strongest storm to traverse the northeastern Caribbean since Hurricane David in 1979.[5][24] The Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model estimated that storm surge from Hugo led to coastal water levels 3\u20134\u00a0ft (0.91\u20131.22\u00a0m) above normal tidal heights along Saint Croix and the eastern end of Puerto Rico.[7] These equated to storm surge heights of around 7\u20138\u00a0ft (2.1\u20132.4\u00a0m).[55] Water levels of 2\u20133\u00a0ft (0.61\u20130.91\u00a0m) above normal were estimated to have occurred along the northern coast of Puerto Rico.[7] Rainfall on the Caribbean islands averaged between 5\u201310\u00a0in (130\u2013250\u00a0mm).[28] The NHC's preliminary report on the hurricane enumerated 28\u00a0fatalities in the eastern Caribbean while media reports tallied over 30.[7][48] As many as 100,000\u00a0people may have been left homeless throughout the region as a result of Hugo.[48] Guadeloupe and Montserrat were hardest-hit among the Leeward Islands, and collectively suffered over $1\u00a0billion in damage and recorded 21\u00a0fatalities.[7][50][56] Though less severe, widespread damage was also inflicted by Hugo across the remainder of the Leeward and Windward Islands. Extensive flooding occurred on Antigua, and power outages befell the island after utility poles were uprooted by the storm.[24] The damage was heaviest towards the southern portions of the island as the center of Hugo passed 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) south.[17]:\u200a3\u200a There were 2\u00a0deaths and 181\u00a0injuries. Another 509\u00a0people were left homeless following damage wrought to 15\u00a0percent of homes.[47] Partial damage was documented on 1,500\u00a0homes and total loss was documented on 106. Thirty percent of fishing vessels were also damaged by the hurricane, equating to thousands of boats.[17]:\u200a3\u200a[48] The total cost of damage reached nearly EC$200\u00a0million.[47] Hugo's damage toll in Saint Kitts and Nevis amounted to $46\u00a0million,[53] largely sustained by shoreline structures and crops.[50] This equated to 32\u00a0percent of the country's gross domestic product.[49] Homes, government buildings, and trees were damaged by the storm.[48][57] A fifth of the country was rendered homeless and the entire populace lost power and water.[53] Ninety percent of the residents of Nevis lost their homes. One person was killed after a wall collapsed upon him.[48][58] Dominica was most affected among the Windward Islands.[59] Hugo ruined 80\u00a0percent of the island's banana crop and interrupted water supplies.[50] Coastal roads were damaged by the hurricane's choppy seas; a washout along a primary thoroughfare isolated the village of Dubique.[48] Bridges and storm drains also took heavy damage.[60] Landslides isolated towns for many days.[50] The damage toll in Dominica totaled $20\u00a0million.[49] Winds in Martinique reached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) on the Caravelle peninsula. Some banana plantations near Macouba were damaged, though wind-related damage in Martinique was otherwise minimal. Moderate rains, peaking at 5.67 inches (144\u00a0mm) in La M\u00e9daille, led to some mudslides. Rough seas flooded parts of Fort-de-France and damaged piers along the Alfassa Boulevard. Beach erosion also occurred along Martinique beaches.[61] The hurricane moved near the Virgin Islands and made two landfalls in Puerto Rico as it egressed the Caribbean, causing considerable destruction. Estimates of the damage toll in this region vary but include over $50\u00a0million each for the British Virgin Islands and Netherlands Antilles, $2\u00a0billion for Puerto Rico, and $500\u00a0million for Saint Croix.[48][23][3][51] Hugo's center was 85\u00a0mi (137\u00a0km) southwest of Sint Maarten at its closest approach; a station there reported a maximum sustained wind 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) and a peak gust of 78\u00a0mph (126\u00a0km/h).[7] These winds unroofed homes and uprooted trees and power lines.[6]:\u200aA5\u200a Roughly 25\u00a0sailboats sustained severe damage and one boat with four people went missing.[48] Sint Eustatius and Saba of the Netherlands Antilles lost much of their vegetation. Many homes, piers, and public buildings suffered severe damage on the two islands.[62] Eleven people were killed in the Netherlands Antilles and caused $50\u00a0million in damage there.[51] The damage toll in the British Virgin Islands exceeded $50\u00a0million, with the loss of at least half of the islands' agriculture. Around 30\u00a0percent of homes were unroofed.[48] Power outages affected the British Virgin Islands. The Associated Press reported \"numerous injuries\" and \"scores of homes destroyed\" on Tortola, the largest island in the BVI.[57] A third of the island's private homes were wrecked.[48] The hurricane also caused widespread power outages in the Dominican Republic while tracking northwest towards the continental United States.[34]:\u200a4A"

Rainfall totals ranged from 3.1 inches (79\u00a0mm) along the southern part of Guadeloupe to 13.8 inches (350\u00a0mm) in more mountainous areas.[64] Hourly rainfall rates averaged roughly 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) per hour in the core of the hurricane.[66] A station in Gardel documented 3.66 inches (93\u00a0mm) of rain in one hour.[61] Along Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin, storm surge from Hugo elevated the seas from 8 to 10\u00a0ft (2.4 to 3.0\u00a0m) above mean sea level.[64] Telecommunications were knocked out by the storm throughout Guadeloupe as winds brought down power and telephone lines.[24][28] The island of La D\u00e9sirade completely lost radio contact with the outside world. Three thousand\u00a0houses, predominantly wooden shanties, were unroofed.[28] Approximately half of Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe's largest city, was destroyed.[65] Part of the control tower at Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre International Airport was wrecked and the airport's radio antenna was knocked down.[67][68]:\u200a12A\u200a Lower sections of Sainte-Rose were inundated by storm surge, resulting in considerable damage.[66] However, the storm's trajectory relative to Guadeloupe prevented a more damaging surge event from occurring.[66][69] Saint-Fran\u00e7ois was largely destroyed, with nearly half of houses remaining. Several tourist hotels there sustained heavy damage. Two people were killed in Le Moule, that been damaged at nearly 80\u00a0percent.[24] The entirety of Guadeloupe's banana crop and most of its coconut palms and sugar cane crops were ruined by Hugo. The storm also wiped out most of the island's fishing fleet,[50] and many ships were grounded by 24-foot (7.3\u00a0m) waves.[48] Debris blocked 70\u00a0percent of roads.[70] There were 11\u00a0fatalities attributed to Hugo in Guadeloupe.[65] Another 107\u00a0people were injured and 35,000\u00a0were rendered homeless. The damage toll in Guadeloupe amounted to $880\u00a0million.[50]"

        "content": "Although Montserrat was struck by many significant storms in the 18th and 19th centuries, the last major hurricane to strike the island before Hugo occurred in 1928.[71] The right-front quadrant of Hugo's eyewall moved over Montserrat on September 17, raking the island with sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[50] The island may have also experienced wind gusts up to 240\u00a0mph (390\u00a0km/h).[72] The hurricane exacted a heavy toll over the course of 14\u00a0hours.[73] Hugo was the costliest hurricane in Montserrat's history, inflicting $260\u00a0million in damage.[50] Entire villages were destroyed by the storm and vegetation was stripped bare.[17]:\u200a4\u200a Most houses on the island were razed or seriously damaged, displacing 11,000 of Montserrat's 12,000\u00a0residents.[50] At least minor damage was dealt to nearly every building on the island, with severe damage inflicted on half of all buildings.[73] Approximately ninety percent of homes suffered either major to total roof loss,[74] with the most severe damage occurring in the Kinsale and St. Patrick's areas. Impacts on upscale hotels contributed to the overall loss of 88\u00a0percent of hotel rooms on the island.[72] Structural and water damage was sustained by hotels.[48] All government buildings and schools in Montserrat were impacted.[75] The headquarters of the Montserrat government lost much of its roof. Air traffic control facilities at W. H. Bramble Airport were destroyed and the airport terminal was seriously damaged.[72] The 180-foot (55\u00a0m) stone jetty at Plymouth was destroyed by Hugo's 20-foot (6.1\u00a0m) waves.[50] Livingstone's port was destroyed.[73] Damage to the fishing sector, including ships, buildings, and equipment, totaled US$5.1\u00a0million.[17]:\u200a4\u200a The island's power grid was left entirely dysfunctional following the storm across both high and low voltage distribution networks.[74] All supply lines and the generator operated by Molec, Montserrat's electricity company, were incapacitated.[73] All major communications facilities were destroyed.[72] Heavy rainfall with accumulations of up to 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) triggered mudslides; one at the foot of Chances Peak wrecked 21\u00a0homes.[50] Radio and microwave transmission towers atop the mountain were toppled and twisted by the hurricane.[72] Strong winds also downed thousands of trees and utility poles.[76] Ten people were killed in Montserrat and 89\u00a0others were injured.[17]:\u200a4\u200a[50]"

There were 26\u00a0fatalities in the United States attributed directly to the weather conditions produced by Hugo; among the country's states and territories, South Carolina had the highest death toll with 13\u00a0direct fatalities. The American Red Cross enumerated 70\u00a0fatalities in the Carolinas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands both directly and indirectly caused by Hugo. The homes of more than 200,000\u00a0families nationwide were damaged or destroyed; 129,687\u00a0families were affected in the Carolinas and 87,700\u00a0families were affected in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.[80]"

        "content": "Hugo was the first significant hurricane to strike the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico region since Hurricane Betsy in 1956.[26] Hugo tracked through the Virgin Islands on September 18 and destroyed 30\u00a0percent of homes in the archipelago.[7][81] Generally 6\u20139\u00a0in (150\u2013230\u00a0mm) of rain fell across the Virgin Islands, peaking at 11.2\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm) at Hams Bluff Light in northwestern Saint Croix.[82] However, most rain gauges in the Virgin Islands were destroyed by the hurricane.[83] The eye of Hugo passed over Saint Croix at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September 18 (02:00\u00a0a.m. AST).[7] Hurricane-force winds lasted for an unusually long time, battering the island from the late evening of September 17 to the morning of September 18.[84] Peak sustained winds in Hugo at the time were estimated at 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h), making it a Category 4 hurricane.[7]  The winds unroofed homes and knocked out power in Saint Croix and Saint Thomas.[24] No official wind measurements were taken on Saint Croix as weather observers evacuated their post at Alexander Hamilton International Airport (now known as Henry E. Rholsen International Airport); the extent of the damage suggested that the entire island was within the envelope of the hurricane's strongest winds.[85] Anemometers on two U.S. Navy workboats recorded peak gusts of 161 and 168\u00a0mph (259 and 270\u00a0km/h). Unofficial reports alleged that Saint Croix experienced gusts in excess of 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h), but these were inconsistent with the severity of damage or were otherwise unsubstantiated.[25] Hugo killed 3\u00a0people and left 3,500\u00a0homeless on Saint Croix. Private and government property damage exceeded $500\u00a0million.[3] Electricity, power, and water services were cut by Hugo across the island. More than 90\u00a0percent of buildings were damaged and vegetation was stripped bare throughout the island.[85] Seventy percent of buildings were destroyed and as many as 75\u00a0percent of homes lost their roofs.[35]:\u200a14A\u200a[36]:\u200aA-4\u200a Many neighborhoods were completely reduced to rubble.[86]:\u200a14-A\u200a Surveys equated the severity of damage to that caused by an F1 or F2\u00a0tornado on the Fujita scale. In some areas, microbursts and the local topography may have amplified the winds, producing more extreme damage.[85] The heaviest damage on Saint Croix was inflicted upon its northern coast from the mouth of the Salt River to the island's eastern end. These coastal extents were directly exposed to intense rainbands associated with Hugo. The sloping terrain near Christiansted accelerated winds near the surface by as much as 20\u00a0percent, enhancing the damage wrought.[25] Stores were damaged in Christiansted.[24] Power and water distillation facilities operated by the Virgin Islands Water & Power Authority west of the city were disabled by the storm. The rupture of a fuel oil tank on the facility grounds caused an oil spill in the Christiansted harbor.[27] Severe damage occurred in south-central Saint Croix near the Hovensa oil refinery and Alexander Hamilton International Airport.[27] Oil tanks at the refinery were damaged, leaving the entire facility incapacitated.[48] The control tower, associated weather instrumentation, and aircraft at the airport were badly damaged.[25][27] A loose steel fuel tank collided into and destroyed a U.S. Customs shed.[86]:\u200a14-A\u200a A UH-1 helicopter and two heavy trucks belonging to the National Guard were destroyed by debris.[86]:\u200a14-A\u200a Less severe damage occurred in southwestern Saint Croix near Frederiksted.[25] Rough surf damaged the city pier, tearing away parts of its concrete decking.[27] Saint Thomas experienced hurricane-force winds and sustained widespread damage to property and vegetation; damage was less severe than on Saint Croix due to Saint Thomas's position farther away from the core of Hugo.[85] A field survey conducted by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that gusts of up to 121\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) occurred on the island.[25] Homes were unroofed and boats were heavily damaged or set adrift.[60] The antenna, tower, and transmitter of television station WBNB-TV in Charlotte Amalie were destroyed; the station would not return to the air because of the damage and the owner's inability to afford repairs.[87]"

An anemometer on the ship Night Cap registered a wind gust of 170\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h) while harbored at Culebra. The strongest wind recorded on Puerto Rico's main island was documented at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which reported a peak sustained wind of 104\u00a0mph (167\u00a0km/h) punctuated by a 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) wind gust. At Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport, sustained winds reached 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h), gusting to 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h).[7] The heaviest rain from Hugo in Puerto Rico occurred in the northeastern part of the island due to the hurricane's trajectory and orographic lifting induced by El Yunque.[83] A peak rainfall total of 17.60\u00a0in (447\u00a0mm) was recorded along the lower R\u00edo Blanco.[88] Flooding was mostly limited to the northeastern corner of Puerto Rico and in San Juan where rainfall was heaviest.[83] In these areas, over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rain fell in 48\u00a0hours.[3] The heavy rainfall drained into the Fajardo River and Mameyes River, causing them to set new records for discharge rates;[82] three other rivers reached discharge rates within 10\u201315\u00a0percent of their highest on record.[3] Flash floods occurred near the Pitahaya and Esp\u00edritu Santo rivers.[82] Floods impacted areas near Luqillo and low-lying portions of San Juan after water pumps lost power.[80][83] Two hundred landslides occurred in Puerto Rico, with the largest of these transporting 40,000\u00a0m3 (1,400,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of debris into a river.[83] Culebra and Vieques, two small islands east of Puerto Rico, experienced harsher impacts than the main island;[89]:\u200a1A\u200a between the two, Culebra experienced stronger winds and heavier damage.[25] The devastation in both islands was nonetheless thorough and widespread.[3] Hurricane reconnaissance observations and the resulting damage in Culebra suggested that the island was struck by 150-mph (240\u00a0km/h) wind gusts.[90] Southeasterly winds were accelerated by the hills on the sides of Ensenada Honda.[91] The homes of 80\u00a0percent of Culebra residents were wrecked.[23] A housing development near the Benjam\u00edn Rivera Noriega Airport was completely destroyed.[25] Many boats in Culebra were damaged,[80] including those that sought refuge in Ensenada Honda.[25] On Vieques, a peak gust of 98\u00a0mph (158\u00a0km/h) was registered, though the damage suggested that gusts of up to 132\u00a0mph (212\u00a0km/h) may have impacted the island.[25] The roof of a baseball stadium was pried off by the winds.[34]:\u200a4A\u200a A thousand families in Vieques were left homeless.[23] The worst damage on the principal island of Puerto Rico occurred along its northeast coast at Fajardo and Luquillo, where the angle of attack of Hugo's winds was most favorable for high storm surge.[80][92] At Luquillo, the storm surge reached 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m), with waves atop the elevated waters reaching at least 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m).[92] Two ferries were grounded at Fajardo by the storm surge; boats sustained over $50\u00a0million in losses while marinas sustained $25\u00a0million in damage.[27] An aerial survey from the U.S. Coast Guard found that winds unroofed 80\u00a0percent of homes between San Juan and Fajardo.[93] Roosevelt Roads Naval Station took heavy damage and lost power and water service.[94] Practically every building was damaged, though only minor injuries occurred.[95] High waves along the coast of the San Juan metropolitan area destroyed walls and sidewalks.[92] Condado suffered widespread damage and debris bestrewed its streets.[34]:\u200a4A\u200a A mobile home park in Lo\u00edza, one of the few in Puerto Rico, was wiped out by the storm surge and strong winds.[92] The winds overturned cars and toppled trees and streetlights around the city.[68]:\u200a1A\u200a[35]:\u200a14A\u200a Buildings in downtown San Juan suffered partial wall and window failures, though overall damage to buildings in the city was light.[25] Fifty airplanes were destroyed at Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport;[34]:\u200a4A\u200a repairs to the airport would cost $20\u00a0million.[89] :\u200a1A Power outages affected 80\u00a0percent of Puerto Rico.[89]:\u200a9A\u200a Power and water supplies in San Juan were cut for more than a week in some areas.[80] At Carra\u00edzo Dam, San Juan's primary supplier of water, five electric motors in the pumping station were inundated, disrupting water distribution; replacement of these motors cost $200,000.[27] The lake formed by the dam had begun to rise, and floodgates were rendered inoperable by power outages.[34]:\u200a1A\u200a Poor maintenance had left the dam vulnerable to a larger catastrophe; however, Hugo's rainfall was ultimately less than forecast.[27] Power distribution systems in San Juan and other communities were severely crippled, leading to power outages affecting thirty-five municipalities.[23] Many power poles in Puerto Rico held a disproportionate number of electrical conductors, resulting in greater power loss than would otherwise be expected for the conditions experienced. A destroyed communications antenna in El Yunque National Forest cut off communication to Vieques and Culebra.[27] Debris in the forest blocked Puerto Rico Highway 191 and strong winds unroofed the local headquarters of the United States Forest Service.[96] Fallen power lines and damage to over 120\u00a0homes marooned the mayor of Arroyo and several others;[35]:\u200a14A\u200a the municipality had been struck by waves 35\u00a0ft (11\u00a0m) high.[60] Damage to highways in Puerto Rico amounted to $40\u00a0million, though only one bridge required closure for repairs.[27] Crops on the island including banana and coffee sustained widespread losses.[52]"

        "content": "The eye of Hugo moved ashore South Carolina at Sullivan's Island at 04:00\u00a0UTC on September 22 (12:00\u00a0a.m. EDT). The storm's maximum sustained winds were estimated by the NHC to have reached 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) during landfall, making Hugo a Category 4 hurricane. This estimate was derived from an aircraft reconnaissance flight into the storm shortly before landfall; no weather stations were positioned along Bulls Bay, where Hugo's strongest winds likely occurred.[7]  This intensity made Hugo the strongest hurricane to strike the United States in 20\u00a0years.[97] The ship Snow Goose, anchored in the Sampit River 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km) west of Georgetown, clocked a 120-mile-per-hour (193\u00a0km/h) sustained wind using an anemometer mounted on the ship's mast.[7][2] In downtown Charleston, a sustained wind of 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a gust of 108\u00a0mph (174\u00a0km/h) were reported. Hugo produced an 8-foot (2.4\u00a0m) storm surge at Charleston, indicating that water levels rose 12.9\u00a0ft (3.9\u00a0m) above mean lower low water as Hugo made landfall.[7] Elsewhere along the South Carolina coast, Hugo produced storm tides as high as 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m).[7] The maximum recorded storm surge was 20.2\u00a0ft (6.2\u00a0m) along Seewee Bay south of McClellanville.[98] This rise in water induced by Hugo resulted in the highest storm tides ever recorded along the U.S. East Coast.[85] Between 3\u20138\u00a0in (76\u2013203\u00a0mm) of rain fell across a swath 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) wide over South Carolina.[7] The maximum rainfall in the state (and the continental United States) was 10.28\u00a0in (261\u00a0mm) as measured in Edisto Island.[88] Totals between 4\u20136\u00a0in (100\u2013150\u00a0mm) were commonplace along the coast of South Carolina.[80] The South Carolina Electric and Gas Company (SCE&G) called Hugo \"the single greatest natural disaster ever to strike the state\", inflicting $5.9\u00a0billion in property damage. The hurricane's trajectory swept across three major South Carolina cities.[99] According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Data publication, there were 35\u00a0deaths associated with Hugo in South Carolina. The hurricane's forces killed 13\u00a0people while another 22\u00a0fatalities were considered \"indirectly-related\".[98] Among the indirect fatalities were two people killed by house fires started by candles during the storm.[100] Another 420\u00a0people were injured throughout the state.[98] The Red Cross documented the destruction of 3,307\u00a0single-family homes and \"major damage\" to another 18,171.[101] Across eight counties, manufacturers incurred $158\u00a0million in damage to factories and $750\u00a0million in inventory and income losses.[102] Much of the South Carolina coast was subject to the ferocity of the hurricane's forces.[98] Hugo's storm surge wrecked the barrier islands, thoroughly razing many structures. Many homes on Wadmalaw Island and Johns Island were crushed by fallen trees.[100] The Ben Sawyer Bridge connecting the South Carolina mainland to Sullivan's Island was heavily damaged and became stuck in an open position.[80] Rows of beachfront homes on Sullivan's Island were razed by the surge. Ships at the marina in Isle of Palms were crumpled into a heap on the mainland shore.[98] Beach homes on Isle of Palms were moved 150\u00a0ft (46\u00a0m) off their foundations by an 11-foot (3.4\u00a0m) storm surge; in total, 60\u00a0homes were destroyed on the island.[103] The damage in Sullivan's Island and Isle of Palms combined was estimated to be approximately $270\u00a0million.[98] Every building on the two islands took damage from the hurricane.[2] Storm surge tore off the pavement from coastal roads and destroyed 80\u00a0percent at Folly Beach.[103] All coastal state parks with the exception of Hunting Island and Edisto Beach sustained significant damage.[98] Charleston County was at the epicenter of Hugo's devastation.[100] At McClellanville, near the point of maximum storm surge, shrimp boats were pushed as far as 0.5\u00a0mi (0.80\u00a0km) inland.[98] Commercial and recreational craft damaged other structures as they were carried ashore.[104] A high school used as a shelter for 1,125\u00a0local residents was inundated by the ocean's advance;[98][105] documentation had listed its elevation 11\u00a0ft (3.4\u00a0m) too high, leading to its mistaken selection as a shelter.[106] The storm surge accumulated within the Ashley, Cooper, and Santee rivers, forcing them over their banks and submerging low-lying areas 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) upstream. One person was killed by the rise of the Cooper River at Mount Pleasant. Seven to eight hundred boats were left in derelict condition,[100] and many in Shem Creek capsized.[2] Hugo's surge spilled over The Battery and overtook the first floors of homes in downtown Charleston. Eighty percent of roofs in the city were damaged, with many already susceptible to strong winds due to poor maintenance and weak structural integrity.[2][107] At least 3,200\u00a0historic structures in Charleston were damaged and 95\u00a0percent of urban trees were lost.[103] Naval Weapons Station Charleston sustained $95\u2013$100\u00a0million in damage. Two people were killed in Charleston by the collapse of their homes.[100] The U.S. Route 17 bridge across Awendaw Creek in Awendaw was destroyed by a 19.4\u00a0ft (5.9\u00a0m) storm tide.[2] Extensive losses to timber occurred at Francis Marion National Forest,[100] where 75\u00a0percent of marketable trees were felled.[99] Most trees were truncated 10\u201325\u00a0ft (3.0\u20137.6\u00a0m) above the ground, with others snapped or uprooted; the cost of damage was estimated by the U.S. Forest Service at between $95\u2013115\u00a0million.[108] Animals, including some from endangered species, were killed at Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge.[100] However, the lack of infrastructure near the refuge significantly reduced the damage wrought by Hugo's strongest winds.[109] Coastal impacts in South Carolina were extensive beyond Charleston County. The waterfront in Georgetown suffered heavily, with the destruction of 150\u00a0homes. Major damage was inflicted upon 350\u00a0homes and minor damage was inflicted upon another 500\u00a0homes, with their aggregate losses amounting to $87\u00a0million. Farms and businesses around Georgetown sustained $10\u00a0million in damage. Only a few beachfront homes withstood the hurricane in Pawleys Island. Debris from destroyed homes piled atop streets along the island's south end. Hugo caused about $944\u00a0million in damage in Horry County.[100] As protective sand dunes were whittled down by the hurricane, beaches along 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) of the coastal Carolinas recessed 50\u2013200\u00a0ft (15\u201361\u00a0m) inland.[110] Beaches were eroded by a 13-foot (4.0\u00a0m) surge up to the most outward row of homes in Garden City.[100][2] These coastal homes were razed or washed inland, dealing damage to additional homes.[111] M. L. Love, the administrator for Horry County, said that the city \"for all practical purposes is gone.\"[2] Severe beach erosion also occurred in Myrtle Beach and North Myrtle Beach.[100] Piers along the coast of Horry County were heavily damaged by storm surge. The pier at Sunset Beach was reduced to its pilings. Myrtle Beach Air Force Base sustained $2\u00a0million in damage from buildings and equipment.[100] With the Grand Strand and Myrtle Beach areas experiencing only low-end hurricane-force winds, the widespread wind damage in those areas was attributed to \"widespread underdesign and marginal building practices.\"[112] Lesser damage occurred along the southern South Carolina coast between Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, with winds there remaining below 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[103] Hugo's acceleration at landfall allowed strong winds to penetrate well inland, causing widespread wind damage across the eastern two-thirds of the state.[113] The NOAA classified wind damage as \"extensive\" in 15\u00a0counties. Devastated groves of pine trees were characteristic of the hurricane's impacts, in addition to numerous unroofed homes and cotton crops injured by the winds and rain.[98][80] Over one-third of all timber in the state was damaged,[98] with the damage most extensive near the coast and locations that were northeast of Hugo's eye as it moved across the state.[114] This quantity of timber was enough to build 660,000\u00a0homes. The total stock of growing softwood was cut by 21\u00a0percent while the total stock of growing hardwood fell by 6\u00a0percent.[115][116] Hugo was widely considered the most significant forest disaster in South Carolina history.[117] Across 23\u00a0counties, 4.4\u00a0million acres (1.8\u00a0million hectares) experienced the loss of 6.6\u00a0million board feet (15,600\u00a0m3) of timber, equivalent to three to four times the annual timber harvest; this was a greater loss of timber than observed in Hurricane Camille, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, and the Yellowstone fires of 1988, combined.[99] Berkeley, Clarendon, Florence, Lee, Sumter, and Williamsburg counties each experienced damage to more than 90\u00a0percent of timberland.[114] A conservative estimate valued the lost timber statewide at $1.04\u00a0billion.[99] Downed trees and wind-blown debris severed power lines, cutting power for most areas.[80] Three power plants were also disabled by the storm. SCE&G reported that 300,000 of its electricity customers lost power, with a complete loss of power east of Interstate 95. Utility services from the South Carolina Public Service Authority were crippled for 99\u00a0percent of the utility's customers.[99]  At Shaw Air Force Base near Sumter, 200\u00a0homes were destroyed and 1,000 sustained heavy damage;[118] the property damage toll for Sumter County was $237\u00a0million. The effects of Hugo in the Carolinas were most fatal in Berkeley County, where eight people were killed. Over a thousand homes and apartments were destroyed and 70\u201380\u00a0percent of the county's trees were blown down. Up to a quarter of York County's cotton crop was lost, with additional losses suffered by peach, sorghum, and soybean crops.[103]"

Along parts of the coast, 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) of beach eroded, including sand dunes that once stood 7\u20138\u00a0ft (2.1\u20132.4\u00a0m) tall. Sixty percent of the sand dunes in Long Beach were eliminated by the hurricane, further exposing areas inland to the storm's fury. Several piers were wrecked by Hugo: the pier at Yaupon Beach was destroyed while a fourth of the pier at Long Beach was lost; the end of the pier at Holden Beach also succumbed to the storm.[2] With the aid of Hugo's rapid forward motion, the swath of damaging winds produced by Hugo in interior South Carolina penetrated into western North Carolina while still a category 1 hurricane and brought extensive damage to areas that rarely experienced impacts from tropical cyclones.[2] Hugo produced a nearly 50-mile-wide (80\u00a0km) corridor of downed trees and power lines west of Charlotte,[80] and hurricane-force wind gusts extended 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) inland. The control tower at Charlotte Douglas International Airport clocked a 99\u00a0mph (159\u00a0km/h) gust,[119] forcing personnel in the airport's control tower to evacuate.[118] Windows were blown out of skyscrapers in Downtown Charlotte. The 400-foot (120\u00a0m) tall WSOC-TV antenna collapsed onto the television station below. Numerous trees in Charlotte were also blown down atop homes and power lines, triggering long-lasting power outages that affected 85\u00a0percent of Charlotte homes and businesses.[2] A six-month-old boy was killed after a tree toppled onto his mobile home; another 15\u00a0people were injured, primarily by falling trees.[119] The winds piled boats together and destroyed or damaged thousands of them in Lake Norman, located north of Charlotte.[119][80] Wind damage in Mecklenburg County amounted to over $500\u00a0million.[118] Millions of trees were felled across the Foothills and Piedmont of North Carolina; some areas endured the resulting power outages for weeks. The National Weather Service office in Wilmington described Hugo's winds as a \"unique event in weather history for this portion of inland North Carolina.\"[2]"

Bath and Bland counties registered 81-mph (130\u00a0km/h) gusts; these were the fastest gusts measured in Virginia in connection with the passing storm. As was the case in North Carolina, the winds downed numerous trees, causing widespread power outages and structural damage. Their arboreal debris obstructed hundreds of roads. Sporadic damage from Hugo occurred as far east as Interstate 95. The damage toll in Virginia was approximately $60\u00a0million, with over $40\u00a0million incurred in Carroll and Grayson County, Virginia counties;[122] six people were killed statewide.[7] While Hugo's quick traversal of the Southeastern U.S. enlarged the area of inland wind damage, it also attenuated rainfall totals;[2] rainfall was relatively light for a storm of Hugo's size.[119] In southwestern Virginia and western North Carolina, the topography of the Appalachian Mountains led to a localized area of heavier rainfalls, resulting in 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) rainfall totals.[80] While Hugo's rainfall was not sufficient to cause major river flooding in North Carolina, minor flooding impacted mountainous areas north and east of Asheville and highways in seven counties.[123] A nursing home in Boone, North Carolina, was evacuated following a flash flood. In Burnsville, North Carolina, flooding prompted the evacuation of 79\u00a0prisoners.[119] Rainfall totals of 1\u20134\u00a0in (25\u2013102\u00a0mm) occurred throughout southwestern Virginia, with a maximum of 6.5\u00a0in (170\u00a0mm) in Hillsville, Virginia. Some low-lying areas and streams flooded, including the New and Roanoke rivers; flooding along the South Fork of the Roanoke forced about 60\u00a0people to evacuate.[122]"

Flooding forced the evacuation of the Oakdale area in Harrison County, West Virginia.[103] Widespread flash flooding occurred across eastern Tennessee, forcing the evacuation of people from affected areas; some of the evacuees had fled South Carolina for the Great Smoky Mountains. Three hundred people were driven out of Carter County. Floods there swamped homes and the downtown area of Roan Mountain. Bridges and roads were washed out in Greene and Johnson counties.[125] Numerous creeks overflowed their banks in northeastern Ohio following heavy rainfall from the remnants of Hugo on the afternoon of September 22. In both Chardon and Medina, 4.3\u00a0in (110\u00a0mm) of rain fell in two hours. Floodwaters inundated urban areas and basements. In the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, flooding overtook cars and buses. High water and washouts forced the closure of U.S. Route 42 and Ohio State Route 94 in Medina County.[126] The juxtaposition of Hugo's extratropical remnants (a low-pressure system) over the eastern Great Lakes region and a strong high-pressure system off the U.S. East Coast generated a sharp contrast in pressure. This led to strong winds over the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. Nearly 85,000\u00a0homes and businesses lost power on Long Island. One person was killed in Norwich, New York, after a falling tree struck the car he was in.[119]  Fifteen counties in Pennsylvania reported high winds in connection with Hugo, with some sustaining damage to trees.[127] Connecticut was buffeted with winds of 40\u201350\u00a0mph (64\u201380\u00a0km/h), blowing down some trees and branches. This led to scattered and brief power outages that affected 30,000\u00a0electricity customers. Total property and crop damage in Connecticut amounted to at least $50,000.[128] Power outages also affected thousands of electricity customers in Massachusetts. Fallen trees and broken limbs caused scattered property damage throughout the state. In western parts of Massachusetts, some apple orchards reported damage to as much as 30\u00a0percent of their crops.[129] In Vermont, the high winds generated swells several feet high on Lake Champlain, freeing some boats from their moorings.

Heavy rainfall also occurred in Ontario, with precipitation in Ontario peaking at 4.5\u00a0in (110\u00a0mm), while a maximum amount of 1.85\u00a0in (47\u00a0mm) was reported in Toronto. As a result of the storm, blackouts and car accidents were reported in Toronto. Furthermore, heavy rains and high winds also occurred across the southern portions of Ontario.[130] The remnants of Hugo tracked northeastward and entered the Canadian province of Quebec. In Montreal, rainfall reached only 0.43\u00a0in (11\u00a0mm), while precipitation amounts in the province peaked at 3.73\u00a0in (95\u00a0mm). In addition to light rain, high winds were reported in the province. Winds in Montreal gusted up to 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), leaving 13,400 homes without electricity. 7,400 residence in Verdun and West Island also lost electricity when tree fell on power lines; it was restored about 12 hours later. While in Brossard and Chambly, power was lost to 5,000 homes and 1,000 homes in Valleyfield. In addition, high winds and heavy rainfall also occurred in the St. Lawrence River Valley.[130] Similar effects were reported in New Brunswick, though little rainfall occurred in the province. Winds gusting to 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h) was reported in Moncton. As a result of high winds, power poles were toppled and tree branches fell, which caused most of New Brunswick's 15,000 power failures. In addition, several tree and signs were blown over in Saint John and Moncton. The storm also significantly affected the apple crop in New Brunswick.

Cyril E. King Airport in Saint Thomas, having suffered less damage, resumed operations within 24\u00a0hours. Power was restored in most of Saint Croix and Saint Thomas within three months. The islands' telephone systems were badly crippled by the storm, and only limited service was restored to businesses in December\u00a01989. Some private residences in Saint Croix remained without telephone service until March\u00a01990.[27] Between 300\u2013500\u00a0prisoners were freed from prison in Saint Croix after the storm, either by escaping or by release due to food and water shortages in the prison.[48] The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dispatched a C-141 airlifter with government relief workers and communications equipment to Saint Croix.[134] The demographics of the Virgin Islands a year after Hugo reflected the hurricane's impact: roughly 10% of Saint Croix's populace did not return to the island within a year of Hugo. A smaller exodus occurred at Saint Thomas and Saint John.[104] Three days after the storm hit, the Governor of the United States Virgin Islands Alexander Farrelly asked President Bush for federal assistance in restoring order to the island.[135] On the island of Saint Croix, looting and lawlessness reigned in the aftermath of Hugo.[136][86]:\u200a1A\u200a FBI agents, U.S. marshals, and local police initially maintained a patrol of Frederiksted and Christiansted while the U.S. Coast Guard evacuated tourists from the island;[137][138]:\u200aA1\u200a the USCGC Bear evacuated 40\u00a0people and sent personnel onshore to monitor the situation.[138]:\u200aA6\u200a However, local law enforcement in Saint Croix was unable to stop widespread looting, with armed gangs reportedly taking root the streets of Christiansted.[93] The Atlanta Constitution reported that some members of the local police and National Guard also took part in looting.[138] For the first time since the Baltimore riot of 1968, American troops were deployed in response to a domestic civil disturbance; with the authorization of U.S. President George H. W. Bush under the Insurrection Act of 1807, the Pentagon sent 1,100\u00a0troops and federal marshals to augment the security presence as local police and the National Guard lost control of the situation.[137][48][138]:\u200aA1\u200a Among the deployments were 470\u00a0troops from the 16th Military Police Brigade, 560\u00a0troops from the 503rd Military Police Battalion, and three helicopters and medical support.[138]:\u200aA6\u200a Dubbed Operation Hawkeye, the operation involved elements of the Army, Navy and the Coast Guard, along with a contingent from the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI, forming Joint Task Force (JTF) 40 for Operation Hawkeye.[135] It also resulted in the first operational deployment of the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), when the New Mexico-1 Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) was deployed to assist in medical care needs of the stricken island.[139] The first contingent arrived in Saint Croix on the morning of September 21 to secure an airfield and devise the command structure for the other arriving troops.[140] National Basketball Association player Tim Duncan, born in Christiansted and a two-time NBA MVP, of the San Antonio Spurs attributed his basketball career to Hurricane Hugo's destruction. When Tim was 13 years old, he was a competitive swimmer who was considered one of the top United States competitors for the 400-meter freestyle. However, in the aftermath of Hugo, every swimming pool on Saint Croix was destroyed, including the Olympic-size swimming pool. With no pool to practice in, Duncan turned to basketball. Tim Duncan said, \"I'm very fortunate to be where I am today. Without Hugo, I might still be swimming.\"[141] On April 4, 2020, it was announced that Duncan would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 29.[142][143]"

On September 24, 47,500\u00a0businesses and homes in Puerto Rico were without power; the San Juan Star reported that a quarter of electricity customers in Fajardo remained without electric service on October\u00a09, three weeks after Hugo struck the island. Residents of Puerto Rico's northeastern coast were encouraged to boil water to curtail the spread of food- and waterborne diseases, though power outages prevented most from doing so. Repair costs for Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority poles and wires amounted to $50\u00a0million; some repair efforts may have been undermined by the looting of copper wire in Hugo's aftermath.[27] At least six workers were killed while repairing power lines.[3] Equipment from the continental U.S. for the restoration of Puerto Rican water supplies arrived beginning on September 22, with the capacity to produce over 200,000\u00a0gallons (760,000\u00a0liters) of potable water daily.

Several members of repair crews were killed or injured in South Carolina and Puerto Rico from ungrounded portable generators.[104] There were 24\u00a0deaths in the aftermath of Hugo in South Carolina.[4] Five people died of heart attacks while surveying Hugo's aftermath in Dorchester County.[100] SCE&G fully restored power to its customers in 18\u00a0days after deploying 4,703\u00a0personnel. The company also offered free bus service for a week and distributed dry ice to the public.[99] Between 15\u201320\u00a0thousand people were left homeless in Charleston County.[100] Homes were primarily rebuilt and repaired by non-profit and ad-hoc groups. Churches and other private non-profit groups managed replacement housing for Hugo victims in at least four South Carolina counties whose governments lacked such capabilities.[104] Temporary housing assistance was extended to 30,000\u00a0storm victims in the state by the FEMA at a cost of $31\u00a0million.[147]:\u200a2\u200a In addition to those offered housing grants, 243\u00a0families were moved to FEMA mobile homes beginning a week after Hugo until April\u00a01990.[147]:\u200a3\u200a State and local governments together contributed $8.25\u00a0million to public assistance projects.[147]:\u200a5\u200a After the storm, Governor Campbell said that the storm destroyed enough timber in South Carolina to \"frame a home for every family in the state of West Virginia.\" An immense salvage effort was undertaken to harvest downed pine trees for pulpwood before they deteriorated to the point where they could not be used. Still standing timber that appeared usable for lumber and plywood frequently had annular separations of the rings that made them dangerous to saw and nearly impossible to cut into plies, so they were also downgraded into pulpwood, leading to such a drop in pulpwood prices that eventually much of the salvage effort ceased.[148] United States Senator from South Carolina Fritz Hollings referred to FEMA as \"a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses\" during a speech on the floor of the United States Senate. An investigation was launched, which led to some reforms in FEMA procedures that helped the agency do a somewhat better job during Hurricane Andrew, the next catastrophic hurricane to strike the United States.[149] The economy of South Carolina continued to grow after Hugo, though some sectors did not benefit from recovery efforts. There was a 14\u00a0percent increase in traffic accidents in Charleston in the wake of the hurricane.

Forests with a greater vertical extent and higher species richness were more protected from the hurricane's effects.[64] Bat populations in Montserrat dropped 20-fold in response to extensive habitat loss and community composition transitioned from one dominated by small frugivores to one dominated by larger frugivores and omnivores.[154][155] Extensive defoliation was documented in the forests of Dominica, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico, where vegetation was stripped bare of their flowers, fruits, and leaves.[156] A survey of bird populations in Saint Croix observed that Hugo's aftermath may have stressed birds more than the hurricane's immediate meteorological forces. Frugivorous, nectarivorous, and seminivorous bird populations declined most among avian diet groups as a result of vegetation loss. The bridled quail-dove (Geotrygon mystacea) was driven out of its traditional habitats on Saint Croix. Declines in the populations of certain bird species were also noted in Saint John. The destruction of habitats forced the relocation of some avian species such as the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus) and northern waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis).[157] The populations or habitats of three endangered Puerto Rican birds were affected by Hugo: the Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata), the Yellow-shouldered blackbird (Agelaius xanthomus), and the Puerto Rican plain pigeon (Columba inornata wetmorei).[156] El Yunque National Forest lost 15\u00a0percent of its trees, valued at $5.2\u00a0million. However, the increased exposure to sunlight following the loss of tree canopies led to increased diversity of plant species.[96] In Montserrat, the endemic Montserrat oriole (Icterus oberi) was driven out of the South Soufriere Hills after losing much of its habitat.[156] Sewage contamination and poor water quality briefly impacted shellfish populations along the coast of South Carolina. The turbulent action generated by Hugo in streams lowered concentrations of dissolved oxygen and increased concentrations of toxic phenols. Nekton communities suffered increased mortality in river channels and marsh creeks near the Charleston harbor due to hypoxia and lowered salinity in the water, though their populations recovered within two months.[110] Increased salinization of coastal soil led to increased tree mortality and discoloration or defoliation of trees. These surge-battered forests were devoid of insects and terrestrial vertebrates for six months, though their populations were well-below pre-storm levels. Benthic invertebrates experienced a 97% decrease in population density but recovered to pre-storm levels in three months.[158] At least 25\u00a0coastal species of birds were displaced as far as 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) inland by the storm.[2] Across the Carolinas, Hugo's winds increased the quantity of downed brush, timber, and debris by up to 15\u00a0times their normal amounts, significantly increasing the risk of wildfires throughout the region.[110] FEMA designated $7\u00a0million towards forest fire mitigation in Hugo's aftermath.[99]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Allison was a tropical cyclone that produced severe flooding in the southern United States. The second tropical cyclone and the first named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season, Allison formed on June 24 in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Development of Allison was a result of the interaction of a tropical wave and the remnants of Pacific hurricane Hurricane Cosme. It moved south and became a tropical storm on June 26. By June 27, Allison made landfall near Freeport, Texas. Allison quickly weakened to a tropical depression later that day, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day. However, the storm's remnants persisted for another 10 days and meandered across the area, triggering flooding across the region, before dissipating on July 7. The storm caused heavy rainfall, amounting to 30\u00a0in (760\u00a0mm) in some places. In total, 11 fatalities resulted from the storm, as well as $560\u00a0million (1989\u00a0USD, $1.38\u00a0billion 2024\u00a0USD) in damage."

        "content": "Three meteorological phenomena combined to produce Tropical Storm Allison. First, Hurricane Cosme moved northward through Mexico in response to a strong mid to upper-level ridge. Its remnants entered the Gulf of Mexico on June 22, when a westward moving tropical wave reached the area. Finally, a strong anticyclone over the Gulf allowed for the disturbed area to organize into Tropical Depression Two in the western Gulf of Mexico on June 24.[1] The depression continued to organize as it drifted to the north, and became Tropical Storm Allison on June 26 off the Texas coast.[1] A ridge to Allison's north weakened in response to an approaching frontal trough, and the tropical storm accelerated to the north. Allison reached a peak of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) winds just before hitting near Freeport, Texas on June 27. It turned to the northeast with the front, weakened to a tropical depression on June 27, and became extratropical on June 28.[2] The frontal trough outran the system, and the building ridge to Allison's north forced the extratropical depression turned to the south and southwest. After executing a cyclonic loop over Texas, the ridge to the north began to erode, allowing Allison to track northeast and out of the state. Its circulation dissipated on July 1, but the remnants retained some organization, and continued to the northeast. On July 3 and July 4, the shortwave that influenced the remnants of Allison accelerated ahead of the storm, causing Allison to become stationary over the borders of Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana. A second shortwave trough brought the remnants of Allison southward into Alabama. It turned to the northwest, and the remnants of Allison became unidentifiable over Arkansas on July 7.[2]"

Severe flooding occurred, with more than 6,200\u00a0homes suffering water damage, which forced hundreds of residents to evacuate and stranding thousands of other people. Losses in Texas were estimated between $200\u00a0million and $400\u00a0million. Additionally, there were three deaths in the state, all of which due to drowning. In Brazoria County, rainfall amounts were generally between 6 and 7 inches (150 and 180\u00a0mm), causing flooding in the West Columbia area. Precipitation up to 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) in Chambers County inundated many streets and caused water intrusion into several homes. Along the Trinity Bay, tides reached almost 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) above normal at Anahuac. Low-lying areas around the mouth of the Trinity River were completely submerged for several days.[4] Local flooding was reported in Galveston County due to rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches (100 to 200\u00a0mm), particularly in Clear Lake, Galveston Island, Kemah, and Texas City. The highest storm surge in the area was 3.9 feet (1.2\u00a0m) above mean sea level, causing some beach erosion. An estimated 20 to 30 yards (60 to 90\u00a0ft) of sand was washed away, while Texas State Highway 87 was closed due to sand and debris spewed onto the roadway from the storm surge. Wind gusts up to 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) downed some trees limbs and power lines. Additionally, a tornado was spawned in Gilchrist and caused minor damage and one injury. In Hardin County, rains of 6 to 8 inches (150 to 200\u00a0mm) fell. The Pine Island Bayou overflowed, flooding homes in Pinewood Estates and Silsbee.[4] Up to 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) of rain fell in the southern portions of Liberty County. As a result, significant flooding occurred along the Trinity River. In Liberty and Moss Bluff, Texas, residents of 8\u00a0subdivisions were left isolated. Throughout the county, an estimated 2,500\u00a0people became stranded. Major streets in Dayton were inundated by as much as 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) of water. About 3,000\u00a0homes were flooded, with 500\u00a0people fleeing for higher ground. In Jasper County, precipitation amounts reaching 9 inches (230\u00a0mm) caused flooding in Buna and Kirbyville, as well as low-lying areas around the Sabine River. Throughout Matagorda County, several streets and low-lying areas were inundated by water due to rainfall amounts up to 10 inches (250\u00a0mm). Similar amounts of precipitation amounts in Montgomery County caused flooding along the San Jacinto River and Caney and Spring Creeks. Low-lying areas were submerged along the Sabine River in Newton County, due to up to 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rainfall. The Sabine River also exceeded its banks in Orange County, flooding several homes and streets.[4] In Jefferson County, up to 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rainfall was reported. Significant flooding occurred in areas around the Hillebrandt Bayou. About 200\u00a0homes and 50\u00a0businesses in Beaumont received water damage, with losses estimated nearly $1.5\u00a0million. Throughout the county, damage reached about $2.8\u00a0million. Two teenage boys drowned in Beaumont, after the raft they were riding on capsized and subsequently swept into a drainage pipe. Along the coast, storm surge ranged between 2 and 4 feet (0.61 and 1.22\u00a0m) in height along the Bolivar Peninsula. This caused minor beach erosion in Jefferson County, while portions of Texas State Highway 87 was also closed here due to sand and debris washed onto the roadway. Wind gusts in the county peaked at 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h).[4]"

The local hardest hit by the flooding was Winnfield, Louisiana, which experienced almost 30\u00a0in (760\u00a0mm) of rain from June 26 to July 1.[5][6] Rainfall from the storm extended eastward into the Mid-Atlantic States, producing flooding.[7] In Delaware, the rainfall led to record breaking discharge rates at three gauging stations, while one-third of the state's gauging stations reported significant discharges.[8] 13.9\u00a0in (350\u00a0mm) of rain fell at a site in Arkansas, the highest rainfall total from a tropical cyclone in the state.[9] Eleven people were reported killed from the storm. Three deaths occurred in Texas, five in Mississippi and three in Louisiana. Two teenage boys were killed when their raft got sucked into a drainage pipe from the runoff of Allison in Beaumont, Texas. An eighteen-year-old was killed in Harris County, Texas from drowning during a swim. The eight final deaths in Louisiana and Mississippi were by drowning. The extreme flooding in turn led to heavy damage, amounting to around $560\u00a0million (1989\u00a0USD).[10]"

One cabin in the Whetstone Creek area was burned. A temporary flight restriction was put in place for the area. Indian Creek Campground was closed.[2] By June 12, heavy smoked had permeated the area. The fire had expanded north into Deer Creek Canyon, Rilda Canyon and the plateaus above Mill Fork Canyon, which all feed into Huntington Canyon.[3] The next day, Highway 31 was closed and areas of Huntington Canyon were closed and select campgrounds were evacuated.[4] On June 14, the highway and Huntington Canyon reopened.[5] However, the next day, June 15, Highway 31 was closed once again due to fire activity and heavy use of the highway by fire crews. By the end of the day, the fire had grown 3,000 acres (12\u00a0km2) to 13,710 acres (55\u00a0km2) and was ten percent contained.[6][7] Officials re-opened Highway 31 through Huntington Canyon on June 16. The fire had minimal activity due to high humidity and cloud cover.[8] The northern part of the fire remained uncontained while crews focused on scattering cut vegetation, stabilizing soils, installing water bars to manage water and sediment, and removing hazardous, fire-weakened trees along roads in contained areas.[9] By June 22, Red Flag Warnings impacted the fire, pushing it into Crandall Canyon and keeping it active in Little Bear Canyon. The fire did not impact the Crandall Canyon Mine and memorial.[10] By June 27, the fire had burnt 17,767 acres (72\u00a0km2) and was 80 percent contained.

The fire continued to grow to 30,000 acres (121\u00a0km2) on July 2, prompting evacuations of 200-300 homes in Strawberry Gorge, Camelot Resort, the Current Creek subdivision, and Pinyon Ridge subdivision.  Red Cross evacuation centers were established at the Fruitland Chapel of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Duchesne High School.[4] By July 3, 191 fire personnel and 2 helicopters had been allocated to the fire, but hazardous conditions limited their ability to respond to the rapidly growing fire.[5]  The escalating situation prompted the evacuation of two more neighborhoods on July 4, and a Type 1 incident management team (IMT) arrived to assume management of the fire.[6] Over the next few days, firefighters successfully slowed the growth of the fire with the support of aerial resources, which by this point included Super Scooper aircraft.  A turning point occurred on July 7, when cloud cover and light rain helped to moderate fire activity, resulting in 30% containment of the fire.[7]  Favorable weather continued to aid firefighters over the next several days, with containment increasing to 60% by July 11, allowing local officials to lift some of the evacuation orders.[8][3] As fire activity continued to diminish, firefighters and other resources were released or reassigned.  Management of the fire was downgraded to a Type 2 IMT on July 18,[9] and remaining evacuation orders were lifted on July 22.[10]  However, the southwest section of the fire perimeter continued to prove problematic due to the inaccessibility of its terrain.  Containment was measured at 93% on July 23, but was subsequently lowered during the first week of August back down to 90%.[11]  Fire management was eventually downgraded again to a Type 3 IMT before being returned to local personnel.[1]  The final incident update was posted on August 31, and later reports indicated that full containment was finally achieved in October 2018.[12]"

The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources began habitat restoration efforts in November 2018, focusing their efforts on the river basin.  Department officials estimate that it will take 3-5 years for vegetation to fill back in and for fish populations to recover from the effects of the fire.[12][13][14] The fire is believed to the result of human activity, but the exact cause was never determined.[1][15]"

Around Coonabarabran, as much as 327 millimetres (over 13\u00a0inches) fell in a single day, whilst falls in the upper part of the Hunter Basin the following day were generally around 200 millimetres (7.9 inches).[2]"

        "content": "With such heavy rain on already very wet ground the Hunter, along with tributaries of the Darling (Castlereagh, Namoi and Macquarie especially). reached levels quite unprecedented since measurements were first taken about 100 years earlier. For instance, the Namoi's discharge, normally only about 25 cubic metres per second (880\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), reached a massive 9,000 cubic metres per second (320,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), whilst the Macquarie peaked at around 6,100 cubic metres per second (220,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). In Maitland the Hunter exceeded its August 1952 record height by nearly a metre,[1] flooding as many as 5,000 homes with as much as five metres of muddy water.[3] 15,000 people were evacuated,[1] most by boat or helicopter, whilst 31 homes were never rebuilt. In Dubbo, four thousand residents were evacuated as the main street was under more than a metre of turgid, muddy water,[1] and the same thing occurred all along the Macquarie River, and at Gilgandra, a third of the buildings were completely destroyed.[1] A hole torn in the main street was later found to contain two large semi-trailers.[1] The floods took altogether the lives of 25 people.[1] Some 2,000 cattle and many thousands of head of other livestock were drowned.[1] The damage to bridges, roads, railways and telephone lines took months to repair. There also were millions of pounds worth of crops destroyed."

        "content": " The 2010 Slovenia floods, on the weekend of 17\u201319 September 2010, were caused by heavy rains in Slovenia, resulting in one of the worst floods in the country's history. Among the regions affected were the capital Ljubljana, the Central Sava Valley, La\u0161ko, the Slovene Littoral and Lower Carniola.[3][4] Initial damage was estimated to reach \u20ac15 million.[5] Three people died.[1][2] In Ljubljana, the river Grada\u0161\u010dica \u2013 together with the Mali Graben stream \u2013 flooded several parts of the Vi\u010d District, and record water levels were reached.[3][6][7] Several transformers were shut down to prevent accidents, leaving some 3,000 people without electricity.[7] In Zagorje ob Savi, a great part of the town was flooded by the Sava river and several landslides were reported.[7][8] The town of La\u0161ko was flooded by the Savinja river and road connections were cut by the flood waters.[7][9] In the Littoral region, the Ri\u017eana and Dragonja rivers flooded several roads, closing all three border crossings with Croatia in the region. Parts of Portoro\u017e Airport and the Se\u010dovlje salt fields were flooded as well.[10] The Vipava River was flooding in the northern Littoral.[7] The Sava, Krka and Kolpa rivers flooded in the Lower Carniola. The towns of Kr\u0161ko, Bre\u017eice and Oto\u010dec were partially flooded.[8] In Upper Carniola, the town of \u017diri was affected by the Poljane Sora. In \u017delezniki, a town that was most affected in the floods exactly three years before,[11] no bigger problems were reported.[12] Some parts of Croatia along the Sava river were also flooded,[13] around 20 people were evacuated around Zagreb.[14] By Monday, 20 September, the water levels began to decrease, although landslides in some regions remained a threat.[15] Four days after the flooding, the area of the Municipality of Dobrepolje was still 6 meters above the usual water-level.[16]"
