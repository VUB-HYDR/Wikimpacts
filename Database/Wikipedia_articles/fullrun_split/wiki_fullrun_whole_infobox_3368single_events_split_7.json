        "content": " Tennessee (/\u00c0\u00e5t\u2026\u00f5n\u2026\u2122\u00c0\u00e0si\u00c0\u00ea/ \u201a\u00ec\u00f2 TEN-iss-EE, locally /\u00c0\u00e0t\u2026\u00f5n\u2026\u2122si/ TEN-iss-ee),[8][9][10] officially the State of Tennessee, is a landlocked state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the southwest, and Missouri to the northwest. Tennessee is the 36th-largest by area and the 15th-most populous of the 50 states. Tennessee's population as of the 2020 United States census is approximately 6.9 million.[11] Tennessee is geographically, culturally, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions of East, Middle, and West Tennessee. Nashville is the state's capital and largest city, and anchors its largest metropolitan area. Tennessee has diverse terrain and landforms, and from east to west, contains a mix of cultural features characteristic of Appalachia, the Upland South, and the Deep South. The Blue Ridge Mountains along the eastern border reach some of the highest elevations in eastern North America, and the Cumberland Plateau contains many scenic valleys and waterfalls. The central part of the state is marked by cavernous bedrock and irregular rolling hills, and level, fertile plains define West Tennessee. The state is twice bisected by the Tennessee River, and the Mississippi River forms its western border. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the nation's most visited national park, is in eastern Tennessee.[12] Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachian Mountains.[13] Its name derives from Tanasi (\u00b7\u00e8\u00ee\u00b7\u00e9\u00e6\u00b7\u00e8\u00e8), a Cherokee town preceding the first European American settlement.[14] Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later the Southwest Territory, before its admission to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. It earned the nickname \"The Volunteer State\" due to a strong tradition of military service.[15] A slave state until the American Civil War, Tennessee was politically divided, with most of its western and middle parts supporting the Confederacy, and most of the eastern region harboring pro-Union sentiment. As a result, Tennessee was the last state to officially secede from the Union and join the Confederacy, and the first former Confederate state readmitted to the Union after the war had ended during the Reconstruction era.[16] During the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from a predominantly agrarian society to a more diversified economy. This was aided in part by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the city of Oak Ridge, which was established during World War II to house the Manhattan Project's uranium enrichment facilities for the construction of the world's first atomic bombs. After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became a key center of scientific research. The state's economy is dominated by the health care, music, finance, automotive, chemical, electronics, and tourism sectors, and cattle, soybeans, poultry, corn, and cotton are its primary agricultural products.[17] Tennessee has played a major role in the development of many forms of popular music, including country, blues, rock and roll, soul, and gospel."

        "header": "Etymology",
        "content": "Tennessee derives its name most directly from the Cherokee town of Tanasi (or \"Tanase\", in syllabary: \u00b7\u00e8\u00ee\u00b7\u00e9\u00e6\u00b7\u00e8\u00e8) in present-day Monroe County, Tennessee, on the Tanasi River, now known as the Little Tennessee River. This town appeared on British maps as early as 1725. In 1567, Spanish explorer Captain Juan Pardo and his party encountered a Native American village named \"Tanasqui\" in the area while traveling inland from modern-day South Carolina; however, it is unknown if this was the same settlement as Tanasi.[b] Recent research suggests that the Cherokees adapted the name from the Yuchi word Tana-tsee-dgee, meaning \"brother-waters-place\" or \"where-the-waters-meet\".[19][20][21] The modern spelling, Tennessee, is attributed to Governor James Glen of South Carolina, who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s. In 1788, North Carolina created \"Tennessee County\", and in 1796, a constitutional convention, organizing the new state out of the Southwest Territory, adopted \"Tennessee\" as the state's name.[22]"

        "content": "The first inhabitants of Tennessee were Paleo-Indians who arrived about 12,000 years ago at the end of the Last Glacial Period. Archaeological excavations indicate that the lower Tennessee Valley was heavily populated by Ice Age hunter-gatherers, and Middle Tennessee is believed to have been rich with game animals such as mastodons.[23] The names of the cultural groups who inhabited the area before European contact are unknown, but archaeologists have named several distinct cultural phases, including the Archaic (8000\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1000 BC), Woodland (1000 BC\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1000 AD), and Mississippian (1000\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1600 AD) periods.[24] The Archaic peoples first domesticated dogs, and plants such as squash, corn, gourds, and sunflowers were first grown in Tennessee during the Woodland period.[25] Later generations of Woodland peoples constructed the first mounds. Rapid civilizational development occurred during the Mississippian period, when Indigenous peoples developed organized chiefdoms and constructed numerous ceremonial structures throughout the state.[26] Spanish conquistadors who explored the region in the 16th century encountered some of the Mississippian peoples, including the Muscogee Creek, Yuchi, and Shawnee.[27][28] By the early 18th century, most Natives in Tennessee had disappeared, most likely wiped out by diseases introduced by the Spaniards.[27] The Cherokee began migrating into what is now eastern Tennessee from what is now Virginia in the latter 17th century, possibly to escape expanding European settlement and diseases in the north.[29] They forced the Creek, Yuchi, and Shawnee out of the state in the early 18th century.[29][30] The Chickasaw remained confined to West Tennessee, and the middle part of the state contained few Native Americans, although both the Cherokee and the Shawnee claimed the region as their hunting ground.[31] Cherokee peoples in Tennessee were known by European settlers as the Overhill Cherokee because they lived west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.[32] Overhill settlements grew along the rivers in East Tennessee in the early 18th century.[33]"

        "content": "The first recorded European expeditions into what is now Tennessee were led by Spanish explorers Hernando de Soto in 1540\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1541, Tristan de Luna in 1559, and Juan Pardo in 1566\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1567.[34][35][36] In 1673, English fur trader Abraham Wood sent an expedition from the Colony of Virginia into Overhill Cherokee territory in modern-day northeastern Tennessee.[37][38] That same year, a French expedition led by missionary Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi River and became the first Europeans to map the Mississippi Valley.[38][37] In 1682, an expedition led by Ren\u221a\u00a9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle constructed Fort Prudhomme on the Chickasaw Bluffs in West Tennessee.[39] By the late 17th century, French traders began to explore the Cumberland River valley, and in 1714, under Charles Charleville's command, established French Lick, a fur trading settlement at the present location of Nashville near the Cumberland River.[40][41] In 1739, the French constructed Fort Assumption under Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville on the Mississippi River at the present location of Memphis, which they used as a base against the Chickasaw during the 1739 Campaign of the Chickasaw Wars.[42] In the 1750s and 1760s, longhunters from Virginia explored much of East and Middle Tennessee.[43] Settlers from the Colony of South Carolina built Fort Loudoun on the Little Tennessee River in 1756, the first British settlement in what is now Tennessee and the westernmost British outpost to that date.[44][45] Hostilities erupted between the British and the Cherokees into an armed conflict, and a siege of the fort ended with its surrender in 1760.[46] After the French and Indian War, Britain issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which forbade settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains in an effort to mitigate conflicts with the Natives.[47] But migration across the mountains continued, and the first permanent European settlers began arriving in northeastern Tennessee in the late 1760s.[48][49] Most of them were English, but nearly 20% were Scotch-Irish.[50] They formed the Watauga Association in 1772, a semi-autonomous representative government,[51] and three years later reorganized themselves into the Washington District to support the cause of the American Revolutionary War.[52] The next year, after an unsuccessful petition to Virginia, North Carolina agreed to annex the Washington District to provide protection from Native American attacks.[53] In 1775, Richard Henderson negotiated a series of treaties with the Cherokee to sell the lands of the Watauga settlements at Sycamore Shoals on the banks of the Watauga River. An agreement to sell land for the Transylvania Colony, which included the territory in Tennessee north of the Cumberland River, was also signed.[54] Later that year, Daniel Boone, under Henderson's employment, blazed a trail from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap, which became part of the Wilderness Road, a major thoroughfare into Tennessee and Kentucky.[55] The Chickamauga, a Cherokee faction loyal to the British led by Dragging Canoe, opposed the settling of the Washington District and Transylvania Colony, and in 1776 attacked Fort Watauga at Sycamore Shoals.[56][57] The warnings of Dragging Canoe's cousin Nancy Ward spared many settlers' lives from the initial attacks.[58] In 1779, James Robertson and John Donelson led two groups of settlers from the Washington District to the French Lick.[59] These settlers constructed Fort Nashborough, which they named for Francis Nash, a brigadier general of the Continental Army.[60] The next year, the settlers signed the Cumberland Compact, which established a representative government for the colony called the Cumberland Association.[61] This settlement later grew into the city of Nashville.[62] That same year John Sevier led a group of Overmountain Men from Fort Watauga to the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina, where they defeated the British.[63] Three counties of the Washington District broke off from North Carolina in 1784 and formed the State of Franklin.[64] Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties, now numbering eight, rejoined North Carolina by 1788.[65] North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized into the Southwest Territory on May 26 of that year.[66] The act allowed the territory to petition for statehood once the population reached 60,000.[66] Administration of the territory was divided between the Washington District and the Mero District, the latter of which consisted of the Cumberland Association and was named for Spanish territorial governor Esteban Rodr\u221a\u2260guez Mir\u221a\u2265.[67] President George Washington appointed William Blount as territorial governor.[68] The Southwest Territory recorded a population of 35,691 in the first United States census that year, including 3,417 slaves.[69]"

        "content": "As support for statehood grew among the settlers, Governor Blount called for elections, which were held in December 1793.[70] The 13-member territorial House of Representatives first convened in Knoxville on February 24, 1794, to select ten members for the legislature's upper house, the council.[70] The full legislature convened on August 25, 1794.[71] In June 1795, the legislature conducted a census of the territory, which recorded a population of 77,263, including 10,613 slaves, and a poll that showed 6,504 in favor of statehood and 2,562 opposed.[72][73] Elections for a constitutional convention were held in December 1795, and the delegates convened in Knoxville on January 17, 1796, to begin drafting a state constitution.[74] During this convention, the name Tennessee was chosen for the new state.[22] The constitution was completed on February 6, which authorized elections for the state's new legislature, the Tennessee General Assembly.[75][76] The legislature convened on March 28, 1796, and the next day, John Sevier was announced as the state's first governor.[75][76] Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796, as the 16th state and the first created from federal territory.[77][78] Tennessee reportedly earned the nickname \"The Volunteer State\" during the War of 1812, when 3,500 Tennesseans answered a recruitment call by the General Assembly for the war effort.[79] These soldiers, under Andrew Jackson's command, played a major role in the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, the last major battle of the war.[79] Several Tennesseans took part in the Texas Revolution of 1835\u201a\u00c4\u00ec36, including Governor Sam Houston and Congressman and frontiersman Davy Crockett, who was killed at the Battle of the Alamo.[80] The state's nickname was solidified during the Mexican\u201a\u00c4\u00ecAmerican War when President James K. Polk of Tennessee issued a call for 2,800 soldiers from the state, and more than 30,000 volunteered.[81] Between the 1790s and 1820s, additional land cessions were negotiated with the Cherokee, who had established a national government modeled on the U.S. Constitution.[82][83] In 1818, Jackson and Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby reached an agreement with the Chickasaw to sell the land between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers to the United States, which included all of West Tennessee and became known as the \"Jackson Purchase\".[84] The Cherokee moved their capital from Georgia to the Red Clay Council Grounds in southeastern Tennessee in 1832, due to new laws forcing them from their previous capital at New Echota.[85] In 1838 and 1839, U.S. troops forcibly removed thousands of Cherokees and their black slaves from their homes in southeastern Tennessee and forced them to march to Indian Territory in modern-day Oklahoma. This event is known as the Trail of Tears, and an estimated 4,000 died along the way.[86][87] As settlers pushed west of the Cumberland Plateau, a slavery-based agrarian economy took hold in these regions.[88] Cotton planters used extensive slave labor on large plantation complexes in West Tennessee's fertile and flat terrain after the Jackson Purchase.[89] Cotton also took hold in the Nashville Basin during this time.[89] Entrepreneurs such as Montgomery Bell used slaves in the production of iron in the Western Highland Rim, and slaves also cultivated such crops as tobacco and corn throughout the Highland Rim.[88] East Tennessee's geography did not allow for large plantations as in the middle and western parts of the state, and as a result, slavery became increasingly rare in the region.[90] A strong abolition movement developed in East Tennessee, beginning as early as 1797, and in 1819, Elihu Embree of Jonesborough began publishing the Manumission Intelligencier (later The Emancipator), the nation's first exclusively anti-slavery newspaper.[91][92]"

        "content": "At the onset of the American Civil War, most Middle and West Tennesseans favored efforts to preserve their slavery-based economies, but many Middle Tennesseans were initially skeptical of secession. In East Tennessee, most people favored remaining in the Union.[93] In 1860, slaves composed about 25% of Tennessee's population, the lowest share among the states that joined the Confederacy.[94] Tennessee provided more Union troops than any other Confederate state, and the second-highest number of Confederate troops, behind Virginia.[16][95] Due to its central location, Tennessee was a crucial state during the war and saw more military engagements than any state except Virginia.[96] After Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, secessionists in the state government led by Governor Isham Harris sought voter approval to sever ties with the United States, which was rejected in a referendum by a 54\u201a\u00c4\u00ec46% margin in February 1861.[97] After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln's call for troops in response, the legislature ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederacy on May 7, 1861.[98] On June 8, with Middle Tennesseans having significantly changed their position, voters approved a second referendum on secession by a 69\u201a\u00c4\u00ec31% margin, becoming the last state to secede.[99] In response, East Tennessee Unionists organized a convention in Knoxville with the goal of splitting the region to form a new state loyal to the Union.[100] In the fall of 1861, Unionist guerrillas in East Tennessee burned bridges and attacked Confederate sympathizers, leading the Confederacy to invoke martial law in parts of the region. Because of this, many southern unionists were sent fleeing to nearby Union states, particularly the border state of Kentucky. Other southern unionists, who stayed in Tennessee after the state's secession, either resisted the Confederate cause or eventually joined it.[101] In March 1862, Lincoln appointed native Tennessean and War Democrat Andrew Johnson as military governor of the state.[102] General Ulysses S. Grant and the U.S. Navy captured the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in February 1862 at the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.[103] Grant then proceeded south to Pittsburg Landing and held off a Confederate counterattack at Shiloh in April in what was at the time the bloodiest battle of the war.[104] Memphis fell to the Union in June after a naval battle on the Mississippi River.[105] Union strength in Middle Tennessee was tested in a series of Confederate offensives beginning in the summer of 1862, which culminated in General William Rosecrans's Army of the Cumberland routing General Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee at Stones River, another one of the war's costliest engagements.[106] The next summer, Rosecrans's Tullahoma campaign forced Bragg's remaining troops in Middle Tennessee to retreat to Chattanooga with little fighting.[107] During the Chattanooga campaign, Confederates attempted to besiege the Army of the Cumberland into surrendering, but reinforcements from the Army of the Tennessee under the command of Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Joseph Hooker arrived.[108] The Confederates were driven from the city at the battles of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge in November 1863.[109] Despite Unionist sentiment in East Tennessee, Confederates held the area for most of the war. A few days after the fall of Chattanooga, Confederates led by James Longstreet unsuccessfully campaigned to take control of Knoxville by attacking Union General Ambrose Burnside's Fort Sanders.[110] The capture of Chattanooga allowed Sherman to launch the Atlanta campaign from the city in May 1864.[111] The last major battles in the state came when Army of Tennessee regiments under John Bell Hood invaded Middle Tennessee in the fall of 1864 in an effort to draw Sherman back. They were checked by John Schofield at Franklin in November and completely dispersed by George Thomas at Nashville in December.[112] On April 27, 1865, the worst maritime disaster in American history occurred when the Sultana steamboat, which was transporting freed Union prisoners, exploded in the Mississippi River north of Memphis, killing 1,168 people.[113] When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, Tennessee was largely held by Union forces and thus not among the states enumerated, so it freed no slaves there.[114] Andrew Johnson declared all slaves in Tennessee free on October 24, 1864.[114] On February 22, 1865, the legislature approved an amendment to the state constitution prohibiting slavery, which was approved by voters the following month, and would go into effect later on in the year. This made Tennessee the only Southern state to abolish slavery at the time.[115][116] Tennessee ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery in every state, on April 7, 1865,[117] and the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted citizenship and equal protection under the law to former slaves, on July 18, 1866. Both amendments went into effect after Tennessee's readmission to the union due to the fact that other states had not yet ratified it.[118] Johnson became vice president when Lincoln was reelected, and president after Lincoln's assassination in May 1865.[102] On July 24, 1866, Tennessee became the first Confederate state to have its elected members readmitted to Congress.[119]"

        "content": "The years after the Civil War were characterized by tension and unrest between blacks and former Confederates, the worst of which occurred in Memphis in 1866.[120] Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment before its readmission to the Union, it was the only former secessionist state that did not have a military governor during Reconstruction.[118] The Radical Republicans seized control of the state government toward the end of the war, and appointed William G. \"Parson\" Brownlow governor. Under Brownlow's administration from 1865 to 1869, the legislature allowed African American men to vote, disenfranchised former Confederates, and with martial law, took action against the Ku Klux Klan, which was founded in December 1865 in Pulaski as a vigilante group to advance former Confederates' interests.[121] In 1870, Southern Democrats regained control of the state legislature,[122] and over the next two decades, passed Jim Crow laws to enforce racial segregation.[123] A total of 251 lynchings, predominately of Black people, took place in Tennessee.[124][125] A number of epidemics swept through Tennessee in the years after the Civil War, including cholera in 1873, which devastated the Nashville area,[126] and yellow fever in 1878, which killed more than one-tenth of Memphis's residents.[127][128] Reformers worked to modernize Tennessee into a \"New South\" economy during this time. With the help of Northern investors, Chattanooga became one of the first industrialized cities in the South.[129] Memphis became known as the \"Cotton Capital of the World\" during the late 19th century, and Nashville, Knoxville, and several smaller cities saw modest industrialization.[129] Northerners also began exploiting the coalfields and mineral resources in the Appalachian Mountains. To pay off debts and alleviate overcrowded prisons, the state turned to convict leasing, providing prisoners to mining companies as strikebreakers, which was protested by miners forced to compete with the system.[130] An armed uprising in the Cumberland Mountains known as the Coal Creek War in 1891 and 1892 resulted in the state ending convict leasing.[131][132] Despite New South promoters' efforts, agriculture continued to dominate Tennessee's economy.[133] The majority of freed slaves were forced into sharecropping during the latter 19th century, and many others worked as agricultural wage laborers.[134] In 1897, Tennessee celebrated its statehood centennial one year late with the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition in Nashville.[135] A full-scale replica of the Parthenon in Athens was designed by architect William Crawford Smith and constructed for the celebration.[136][137]"

Alvin C. York of Fentress County became one of the most famous and honored American soldiers of World War I. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor for single-handedly capturing an entire German machine gun regiment during the Meuse\u201a\u00c4\u00ecArgonne offensive.[141] On July 9, 1918, Tennessee suffered the worst rail accident in U.S. history when two passenger trains collided head on in Nashville, killing 101 and injuring 171.[142] On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th and final state necessary to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave women the right to vote.[143] In 1925, John T. Scopes, a high school teacher in Dayton, was tried and convicted for teaching evolution in violation of the state's recently passed Butler Act.[144] Scopes was prosecuted by former Secretary of State and presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and defended by attorney Clarence Darrow. The case was intentionally publicized,[145] and highlighted the creationism-evolution controversy among religious groups.[146] In 1926, Congress authorized the establishment of a national park in the Great Smoky Mountains, which was officially established in 1934 and dedicated in 1940.[147] When the Great Depression struck in 1929, much of Tennessee was severely impoverished even by national standards.[148] As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created in 1933 to provide electricity, jobs, flood control, improved waterway navigation, agricultural development, and economic modernization to the Tennessee River Valley.[149] The TVA built several hydroelectric dams in the state in the 1930s and 1940s, which inundated communities and thousands of farmland acreage, and forcibly displaced families via eminent domain.[150][151] The agency quickly grew into the country's largest electric utility and initiated a period of dramatic economic growth and transformation that brought many new industries and employment opportunities to the state.[149][152] During World War II, East Tennessee was chosen for the production of weapons-grade fissile enriched uranium as part of the Manhattan Project, a research and development undertaking led by the U.S. to produce the world's first atomic bombs. The planned community of Oak Ridge was built to provide accommodations for the facilities and workers; the site was chosen due to the abundance of TVA electric power, its low population density, and its inland geography and topography, which allowed for the natural separation of the facilities and a low vulnerability to attack.[153][154] The Clinton Engineer Works was established as the production arm of the Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge, which enriched uranium at three major facilities for use in atomic bombs. The first of the bombs was detonated in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in a test code-named Trinity, and the second, nicknamed \"Little Boy\", was dropped on Imperial Japan at the end of World War II.[155] After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became an institution for scientific and technological research.[156]"

Board of Education in 1954, Oak Ridge High School in 1955 became the first school in Tennessee to be integrated.[157] The next year, nearby Clinton High School was integrated, and Tennessee National Guard troops were sent in after pro-segregationists threatened violence.[157] Between February and May 1960, a series of sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Nashville organized by the Nashville Student Movement resulted in the desegregation of facilities in the city.[158] On April 4, 1968, James Earl Ray assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis.[159] King had traveled there to support striking African American sanitation workers.[160][161] The 1962 U.S. Supreme Court case Baker v. Carr arose out of a challenge to the longstanding rural bias of apportionment of seats in the Tennessee legislature and established the principle of \"one man, one vote\".[162][163] The construction of Interstate 40 through Memphis became a national talking point on the issue of eminent domain and grassroots lobbying when the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) attempted to construct the highway through the city's Overton Park. A local activist group spent many years contesting the project, and in 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the group and established the framework for judicial review of government agencies in the landmark case of Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe.[164][165] TVA's construction of the Tellico Dam in Loudon County became the subject of national controversy in the 1970s when the endangered snail darter fish was reported to be affected by the project. After lawsuits by environmental groups, the debate was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court case Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill in 1978, leading to amendments of the Endangered Species Act.[166] The 1982 World's Fair was held in Knoxville.[167] Also known as the Knoxville International Energy Exposition, the fair's theme was \"Energy Turns the World\". The exposition was one of the most successful, and the most recent world's fair to be held in the U.S.[168] In 1986, Tennessee held a yearlong celebration of the state's heritage and culture called \"Homecoming '86\".[169][170] Tennessee celebrated its bicentennial in 1996 with a yearlong celebration called \"Tennessee 200\". A new state park that traces the state's history, Bicentennial Mall, was opened at the foot of Capitol Hill in Nashville.[171] The same year, the whitewater slalom events at the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games were held on the Ocoee River in Polk County.[172] In 2002, Tennessee amended its constitution to establish a lottery.[173] In 2006, the state constitution was amended to outlaw same-sex marriage. This amendment was invalidated by the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges.[174] On December 23, 2008, the largest industrial waste spill in United States history occurred at TVA's Kingston Fossil Plant when more than 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash slurry was accidentally released into the Emory and Clinch Rivers.[175][176] The cleanup cost more than $1 billion and lasted until 2015.[177]"

Culturally, most of the state is considered part of the Upland South, and the eastern third is part of Appalachia.[178] Tennessee covers roughly 42,143 square miles (109,150\u00a0km2), of which 926 square miles (2,400\u00a0km2), or 2.2%, is water. It is the 16th smallest state in land area. The state is about 440 miles (710\u00a0km) long from east to west and 112 miles (180\u00a0km) wide from north to south. Tennessee is geographically, culturally, economically, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions: East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee.[179] It borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi on the south, and Arkansas and Missouri on the west. It is tied with Missouri as the state bordering the most other states.[180] Tennessee is trisected by the Tennessee River, and its geographical center is in Murfreesboro. Nearly three\u201a\u00c4\u00ecfourths of the state is in the Central Time Zone, with most of East Tennessee on Eastern Time.[181] The Tennessee River forms most of the division between Middle and West Tennessee.[179] Tennessee's eastern boundary roughly follows the highest crests of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the Mississippi River forms its western boundary.[182] Due to flooding of the Mississippi that has changed its path, the state's western boundary deviates from the river in some places.[183] The northern border was originally defined as 36\u00ac\u221e30\u201a\u00c4\u2264 north latitude and the Royal Colonial Boundary of 1665, but due to faulty surveys, begins north of this line in the east, and to the west, gradually veers north before shifting south onto the actual 36\u00ac\u221e30\u201a\u00c4\u2264 parallel at the Tennessee River in West Tennessee.[182][184] Uncertainties in the latter 19th century over the location of the state's border with Virginia culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court settling the matter in 1893, which resulted in the division of Bristol between the two states.[185] An 1818 survey erroneously placed Tennessee's southern border 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) south of the 35th parallel; Georgia legislators continue to dispute this placement, as it prevents Georgia from accessing the Tennessee River.[186] Marked by a diversity of landforms and topographies, Tennessee features six principal physiographic provinces, from east to west, which are part of three larger regions: the Blue Ridge Mountains, Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, and Cumberland Plateau, part of the Appalachian Mountains; the Highland Rim and Nashville Basin, part of the Interior Low Plateaus of the Interior Plains; and the East Gulf Coastal Plain, part of the Atlantic Plains.[187][188] Other regions include the southern tip of the Cumberland Mountains, the Western Tennessee Valley, and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. The state's highest point, which is also the third-highest peak in eastern North America, is Kuwohi, at 6,643 feet (2,025\u00a0m) above sea level.[189] Its lowest point, 178 feet (54\u00a0m), is on the Mississippi River at the Mississippi state line in Memphis.[5] Tennessee has the most caves in the United States, with more than 10,000 documented.[190] Geological formations in Tennessee largely correspond with the state's topographic features, and, in general, decrease in age from east to west. The state's oldest rocks are igneous strata more than 1 billion years old found in the Blue Ridge Mountains,[191][192] and the youngest deposits in Tennessee are sands and silts in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain and river valleys that drain into the Mississippi River.[193] Tennessee is considered seismically active and contains two major seismic zones, although destructive earthquakes rarely occur there.[194][195] The Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone spans the entirety of East Tennessee from northwestern Alabama to southwestern Virginia, and is considered one of the most active zones in the Southeastern United States, frequently producing low-magnitude earthquakes.[196] The New Madrid Seismic Zone in the northwestern part of the state produced a series of devastating earthquakes between December 1811 and February 1812 that formed Reelfoot Lake near Tiptonville.[197]"

These mountains, which average 5,000 feet (1,500\u00a0m) above sea level in Tennessee, contain some of the highest elevations in eastern North America. The state's border with North Carolina roughly follows the highest peaks of this range, including Kuwohi. Most of the Blue Ridge area is protected by the Cherokee National Forest, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and several federal wilderness areas and state parks.[198] The Appalachian Trail roughly follows the North Carolina state line before shifting westward into Tennessee.[199] Stretching west from the Blue Ridge Mountains for about 55 miles (89\u00a0km) are the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, also known as the Tennessee Valley[c] or Great Valley of East Tennessee. This area consists of linear parallel ridges separated by valleys that trend northeast to southwest, the general direction of the entire Appalachian range.[200] Most of these ridges are low, but some of the higher ones are commonly called mountains.[200] Numerous tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the Ridge and Valley region.[201] The Cumberland Plateau rises to the west of the Tennessee Valley, with an average elevation of 2,000 feet (610\u00a0m).[202] This landform is part of the larger Appalachian Plateau and consists mostly of flat-topped tablelands.[203] The plateau's eastern edge is relatively distinct, but the western escarpment is irregular, containing several long, crooked stream valleys separated by rocky cliffs with numerous waterfalls.[204] The Cumberland Mountains, with peaks above 3,500 feet (1,100\u00a0m), comprise the northeastern part of the Appalachian Plateau in Tennessee, and the southeastern part of the Cumberland Plateau is divided by the Sequatchie Valley.[204] The Cumberland Trail traverses the eastern escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains.[205] West of the Cumberland Plateau is the Highland Rim, an elevated plain that surrounds the Nashville Basin, a geological dome.[206] Both of these physiographic provinces are part of the Interior Low Plateaus of the larger Interior Plains. The Highland Rim is Tennessee's largest geographic region, and is often split into eastern and western halves.[207] The Eastern Highland Rim is characterized by relatively level plains dotted by rolling hills, and the Western Highland Rim and western Nashville Basin are covered with uneven rounded knobs with steep ravines separated by meandering streams.[208] The Nashville Basin has rich, fertile farmland,[209] and porous limestone bedrock very close to the surface underlies both the Nashville Basin and Eastern Highland Rim.[210] This results in karst that forms numerous caves, sinkholes, depressions, and underground streams.[211] West of the Highland Rim is the Western Tennessee Valley, which consists of about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) in width of hilly land along the banks of the Tennessee River.[212] West of this is the Gulf Coastal Plain, a broad feature that begins at the Gulf of Mexico and extends northward into southern Illinois.[213] The plain begins in the east with low rolling hills and wide stream valleys, known as the West Tennessee Highlands, and gradually levels out to the west.[214] It ends at steep loess bluffs overlooking the Mississippi embayment, the westernmost physiographic division of Tennessee, which is part of the larger Mississippi Alluvial Plain.[215] This flat 10 to 14 miles (16 to 23\u00a0km) wide strip is commonly known as the Mississippi Bottoms, and contains lowlands, floodplains, and swamps.[216][217]"

Most of West Tennessee is in the Lower Mississippi River watershed.[220] The entirety of the state is in the Mississippi River watershed, except for a small sliver near the southeastern corner traversed by the Conasauga River, which is part of the Mobile Bay watershed.[223]"

Generally, the state has hot summers and mild to cool winters with generous precipitation throughout the year. The highest average monthly precipitation usually occurs between December and April. The driest months, on average, are August to October. The state receives an average of 50 inches (130\u00a0cm) of precipitation annually. Snowfall ranges from 5 inches (13\u00a0cm) in West Tennessee to over 80 inches (200\u00a0cm) in East Tennessee's highest mountains.[239][240] Summers are generally hot and humid, with most of the state averaging a high of around 90\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (32\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC). Winters tend to be mild to cool, decreasing in temperature at higher elevations. For areas outside the highest mountains, the average overnight lows are generally near freezing.

Its Grand Divisions also manifest into distinct cultural regions, with East Tennessee commonly associated with Southern Appalachia,[348] and Middle and West Tennessee commonly associated with Upland Southern culture and sometimes even Deep Southern culture.[349] Parts of West Tennessee, especially Memphis, are sometimes considered part of the Deep South.[350] The Tennessee State Museum in Nashville chronicles the state's history and culture.[351] Tennessee is perhaps best known culturally for its musical heritage and contributions to the development of many forms of popular music, particularly in the country genre.[352][353] Notable authors with ties to Tennessee include Cormac McCarthy, Peter Taylor, James Agee, Francis Hodgson Burnett, Thomas S. Stribling, Ida B. Wells, Nikki Giovanni, Shelby Foote, Ann Patchett, Ishmael Reed, and Randall Jarrell. The state's well-known contributions to Southern cuisine include Memphis-style barbecue, Nashville hot chicken, and Tennessee whiskey.[354]"

Many consider Memphis's Beale Street the epicenter of the blues, with musicians such as W. C. Handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909.[352] Memphis was historically home to Sun Records, where musicians such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Charlie Rich began their recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s.[352] Stax Records in Memphis became one of the most important labels for soul artists in the late 1950s and 1960s, and a subgenre known as Memphis soul emerged.[355] The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry.[356][357] Nashville became known as \"Music City\", and the Grand Ole Opry remains the nation's longest-running radio show.[353] Many museums and historic sites recognize Tennessee's role in nurturing various forms of popular music, including Sun Studio, Memphis Rock N' Soul Museum, Stax Museum of American Soul Music, and Blues Hall of Fame in Memphis, the Ryman Auditorium, Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum, National Museum of African American Music, and Music Row in Nashville, the International Rock-A-Billy Museum in Jackson, the Mountain Music Museum in Kingsport, and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum in Bristol.[358] The Rockabilly Hall of Fame, an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly, is also based in Nashville. Several annual music festivals take place throughout the state, the largest of which are the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis, the CMA Music Festival in Nashville, Bonnaroo in Manchester, and Riverbend in Chattanooga.[359]"

Separate criminal courts serve 13 of the 31 judicial districts; circuit courts handle criminal cases in the remaining districts. Local courts include general sessions, juvenile and domestic, and municipal courts.[407] Tennessee maintains four dedicated law enforcement agencies: the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP), the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC). The Highway Patrol is the primary entity that enforces highway safety regulations and general non-wildlife state laws. It is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Safety. The TWRA is an independent agency tasked with enforcing all wildlife, boating, and fishery regulations outside of state parks. TDEC enforces state environmental laws and regulations. The TBI is the primary state-level criminal investigative department. State park rangers are responsible for all activities and law enforcement inside the Tennessee State Parks system. Tennessee, like many other southern states, has a strong reputation for harsh criminal punishment.

Democratic strength is largely concentrated in Nashville, Memphis, and parts of Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Clarksville. Several suburban areas of Nashville and Memphis also contain significant Democratic minorities. Tennessee is one of thirteen states which holds its presidential primaries on Super Tuesday.[420] Tennessee does not require voters to declare a party affiliation when registering. The state is one of eight states which require voters to present a form of photo identification.[421] Tennessee has one of the highest rates of felony disenfranchisement, with nearly 10% of its voting-age population ineligible to vote. The state also has the highest rate of Black and Latino felony disenfranchisement.[422][423] Between the end of the Civil War and the mid-20th century, Tennessee was part of the Democratic Solid South, but had the largest Republican minority of any former Confederate state.[424] During this time, East Tennessee was heavily Republican and the western two-thirds mostly voted Democratic, with the latter dominating the state.[425] This division was related to the state's pattern of Unionist and Confederate loyalism during the Civil War.[425] Tennessee's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South. The first has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881, and Republicans or their antecedents have held it for all but four years since 1859.[426] The second has been held continuously by Republicans or their antecedents since 1855.[427] During Reconstruction, freedmen and former free blacks were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party. Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. However, the Democratic Party regained control of the state in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics, but in the 1880s, the White-dominated state government passed Jim Crow laws, one of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. These served to disenfranchise most African Americans, and their power in state and local politics was markedly reduced. After the disenfranchisement of blacks, the Republican Party became a primarily white sectional party supported mostly in East Tennessee. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved legislation allowing cities to adopt a commission form of government based on at-large voting as a means to limit African American political participation.[428] Not until after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were African Americans able to regain their full voting rights.[429] Between the end of Reconstruction and the mid-20th century, Tennessee voted consistently Democratic in Presidential elections, except in two nationwide Republican landslides in the 1920s. Tennesseans narrowly supported Warren G. Harding over Ohio Governor James Cox in 1920,[430] and more decisively voted for Herbert Hoover over New York Governor Al Smith in 1928.[431] During the first half of the 20th century, state politics were dominated by the Democratic Crump machine in Memphis.[432] For most of the second half of the 20th century, Tennessee was a swing state in presidential elections.[433] During this time, Democratic presidential nominees from Southern states, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton, tended to fare better in Tennessee than their Northern counterparts, especially among split-ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas. In the 1950s, Tennessee twice voted for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during World War II.[434] Howard Baker, first elected in 1966, became the first Republican U.S. Senator from Tennessee since Reconstruction.[435] The Republican Southern strategy did not have as much of an effect in Tennessee as in most Southern states, but the elections of Winfield Dunn as governor and Bill Brock to the U.S. Senate in 1970 further helped make the GOP competitive among Whites in statewide elections.[436] In the 2000 presidential election, Vice President Al Gore, who had previously served as a Democratic U.S. Senator from Tennessee, failed to carry his home state, an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support.[437] Beginning in the early 21st century, Tennessee transitioned into a solid Republican state, primarily due to rural white voters who have rejected the increasing liberalism of the Democratic Party.[438][439] In 2004, Republican President George W. Bush increased his margin of victory in the state from a 4% to a 14% margin in 2000.[440][441] In 2007, Ron Ramsey became the first Republican Speaker of the State Senate since Reconstruction,[442] and the following year the Republicans gained control of both houses of the state legislature for the first time since Reconstruction.[443] Voters, however, continued to elect moderate Republicans, such as centrists Bill Haslam and Lamar Alexander, until the late 2010s with the rise of Trumpism in the GOP at a nationwide scale.[444] Since 2016, Tennessee has been the most populous state to vote Republican by more than 60% in presidential elections,[445] and in 2020 voted Republican by the largest margin of any state in terms of number of votes.[446]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Zeta was a very late-developing tropical storm that formed in the central Atlantic Ocean during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, one month after the season's official end. Becoming a tropical depression on December 30, and intensifying the following day into the season's 28th storm (including one unnamed subtropical storm), Zeta continued into January 2006.[1] It was one of only two Atlantic tropical cyclones to span two calendar years (the other being Hurricane Alice in 1954\u201355). Zeta originated from an area of low pressure on December 29, which previously developed within an upper-level trough. After becoming a tropical storm, Zeta remained organized, defying predictions of a quick demise, and even grew slightly more intense. The storm reached its peak strength on January 2, 2006, before degenerating into a remnant low on January 6 and dissipating on the next day. Several ships encountered the storm, and several crews in the 2005 Woodvale Atlantic Rowing Race were affected by rough seas and high winds. Even so, as no land areas were threatened by Zeta, the NHC did not issue any tropical storm watches or warnings.[1]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Zeta originated from an upper-level trough that interacted with a weakening frontal system in late-December 2005. By December\u00a028, the trough had developed into a low pressure area roughly 750\u00a0mi (1,210\u00a0km) west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The following day, a low-level circulation developed and convective activity began to increase around the low. By December\u00a030, sufficient shower and thunderstorm activity had developed for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as a tropical cyclone, Tropical Depression 31. Over the following several hours, convective banding developed around the storm's center and by 0600\u00a0UTC, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Zeta, the record 28th tropical or subtropical cyclone to form during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.[1] Operationally, however, the NHC did not begin issuing advisories on Zeta until 1700\u00a0UTC.[2] Traveling slowly northwestward in response to a mid-level low to the southwest, the storm gradually intensified in a region of favorable anticyclonic outflow.[1] By the afternoon of December\u00a030, dry air caused the system to become slightly disorganized and led forecasters to anticipate further weakening of the storm, with Zeta forecast to begin dissipating in 36 hours and become a remnant low 12 hours later. In addition, there was evidence of some westerly wind shear beginning to impinge on the system at the time.[3] Early on the next day, wind shear began affecting Zeta even more, with much of the convection east of the circulation center. However, the circulation remained tight and well-defined, and the storm maintained its intensity.[4] A few hours later, a deep burst of convection over the low-level circulation center allowed the storm to intensify a bit, with a central dense overcast forming. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model also began to forecast Zeta to become a hurricane, but forecasters found this unlikely to occur.[5] A mid-level ridge to the north caused Zeta turn westward before nearly stalling due to upper-level westerlies.[1] An eye-like feature was briefly present, and the storm attained its initial peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[6] Soon after, increasing wind shear caused convection to become disorganized, resulting in a brief weakening period.[7] On January 1, 2006, Zeta began re-organizing despite high shear, with outflow of the system becoming less restricted and the cloud pattern more symmetric.[8] Forecaster Lixion Avila stated it felt like \"previous tropical cyclone Epsilon all over again\" as the storm refused to weaken despite guidance insisting it would with (similar to Epsilon) cooler upper-atmospheric temperatures being the only thing favoring intensification. As a result he had \"no choice but to forecast weakening again and again.\"[9] Bursts of convection continued to keep the storm alive in the face of moderate upper-level wind shear.[10] On January 2, Zeta began to gradually intensify \"against all odds and forecasts\".[11] Convection remained over the center, and the storm's outflow expanded as well.[12] Forecaster Avila praised the GFDL model for being the only one to not forecast weakening, but hesitated to follow it based on the GFDL insisting on it becoming a hurricane and the \"approaching hostile environment forecast[ed] by every other model.\"[11] Around 0000\u00a0UTC on January 3, Zeta attained its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 994\u00a0hPa (29.35\u00a0inHg) about 1,035\u00a0mi (1,665\u00a0km) to the northwest of the Cape Verde Islands.[1] The storm would maintain this intensity for 24 hours as it began tracking towards the southwest in response to a mid-level trough located east of the storm.[13]\nTropical Storm Zeta continued to defy forecasts of weakening.[14] The effects of wind shear finally took their toll late on January 4, and Zeta's convection began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm the following day.[1] The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed to have been an error and the storm was \"regretfully\" upgraded back to tropical storm status the next advisory.[15][16] Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and degenerated into a remnant low later that day. With this transition, the very active 2005 hurricane season belatedly came to a close. The remnant low retained its identity for another day, before dissipating southeast of Bermuda during January 7.[1] NHC forecaster James Franklin noted that the atmosphere \"seem[ed] to want to develop tropical storms ad nauseam\".[3] Due to the fact that Zeta, along with previous storms Epsilon and Vince, defied forecasts of weakening, the NHC remarked that they needed a better understanding of storms in the subtropics.[17]"

It was the ninth named storm, third typhoon and the second super-typhoon of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season. The low-pressure area which became Typhoon Muifa originally formed on 23 July. It gradually drifted to the west, becoming a tropical depression. As it turned north and neared the Philippines it rapidly strengthened, becoming a Category 5 typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS). In the Philippines, the storm claimed eight lives and caused much damage. The system brought down trees; the northeast Philippines experienced strong winds and heavy rains, leaving motorists stranded on several roads and expressways. Muifa also sank a Malay ship with 178 passengers. The system then drifted north, weakening steadily until it curved to the west and threatened Micronesia. The typhoon hit Okinawa, Japan with 41 inches of rain, flooding the small island and injuring 37 people in a 30-hour period. The storm disrupted air travel, leaving 13,630 people stranded on the island. The system then steadily drifted west, nearing Taiwan and prompting emergency warnings and high alerts; however, the storm missed the island. The typhoon moved further west towards mainland China, causing thousands to flee from their homes. A level-4 high-wave warning was issued, and some 11,000 rescue workers mobilized in 120 teams."

Late on 23 July, one of the last low-pressure systems developed further to a weak tropical disturbance, which formed southeast of Chuuk in Micronesia.[1] The system drifted to the west, and on 25 July the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression. At that time, it was located approximately 505 nautical miles (935\u00a0km; 581\u00a0mi) west of Guam.[2] At midnight that day, the JMA began monitoring the system as a tropical depression.[3] Early on 28 July, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm.[4] A few hours later the JMA also upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it Muifa.[5] Also on 28 July, the storm entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR); the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) named it Kabayan.[6] The storm drifted north over the next day, while maintaining tropical-storm strength. On the night of 29 July, Muifa was upgraded to a severe tropical storm.[7] Overnight, the storm strengthened rapidly and was upgraded to a typhoon the next morning.[8] According to the JTWC, Muifa had strengthened from a tropical storm to a super typhoon in less than 24 hours; it reported that the storm was reaching one-minute sustained wind speed of 140 knots (260\u00a0km/h; 160\u00a0mph). However, the typhoon weakened later in the day. According to the JTWC, on 31 July the typhoon encountered an upper-level trough and weakened to a category-4 typhoon on the SSHS.[9] The system gradually moved north, then turned west and drifted towards Okinawa before turning northwest again (when it was finally downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC).[10] Soon afterwards, the JMA downgraded Muifa to a severe tropical storm.[11] After weakening to a tropical storm, Muifa made landfall at the estuary of the Yalu River on 8 August and the JTWC issued its final warning. Early on 9 August, Muifa weakened to a tropical depression in northeast China and later became a low-pressure area."

The storm was expected to bring rainfall to more than ten provinces, over an area of one million square kilometers.[25] On 6 August, as the typhoon approached, over 200,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas; however, although 140 more flights were cancelled the typhoon was no longer expected to directly impact the nation.[26] The meteorological agency announced that heavy rain and strong winds would affect the nation for three days, beginning on 7 August.[27] Some 11,000 rescue workers in 120 teams were mobilized to respond to the storm and protect as many people as possible.[28] The National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center issued a red alert (the highest alert in the four-level high-wave warning system) as the system swept across the East China Sea at typhoon strength. Waves as high as 9\u201311 meters were expected throughout the East China Sea.[29] Shanghai railway authorities established an emergency response plan: if Muifa's winds were less than 62\u00a0km/h in Shanghai, the subway would be manually operated at low speed. If winds were greater than 89\u00a0km/h, the trains would be cancelled.[30] Both airports in Shanghai were closed, and all outdoor events were also cancelled or postponed.[31] As the system neared land, the Shanghai government urged residents to stay indoors with first-aid kits and emergency supplies.[32] A message from the federal government of the United States to Americans living in China advised them to \"stock up on emergency supplies of food, water, and cash in case of storm-related power outages\".[33] As the system brushed Shanghai, residents of Qingdao began their preparations for the storm. Although weaker, the system's heavy surf battered Qingdao's waterfront and the beaches were closed.[34] As reported on 9 August, some 1.35 million people were evacuated as the system approached its final landfall in northern China.[35]"

As the system began to strengthen, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its first warning on the system as it strengthen to a tropical depression on June 13.[1] Moving westward, Tropical Depression 09W continued to strengthen and on June 14, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency[3] upgraded the depression to tropical storm status. After becoming a tropical storm, Dianmu remained stationary west of Yap where it continued to strengthen.[1] The Japan Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to typhoon status at 1800 UTC.[3] Dianmu then moved north-northwestward at speeds between 6-9\u00a0kts (11\u201317\u00a0km/h, 7-10\u00a0mph) as it winds reached 241\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to upgrade the storm to supertyphoon status on June 15. The following day, Dianmu continued northward as the storm reached category 5 status. At the same time, the storm entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) area of responsibility and was given the name Helen.[1] Dianmu reached its maximum intensity as its winds reached up to 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph)[4] and the barometric pressure fell to 915\u00a0millibars. The JMA assessed the typhoon attaining a 10-minute peak of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) winds.[1] After maintaining Supertyphoon status for 42\u00a0hours,[5] the storm began to weaken as it swung westward. The typhoon briefly regained supertyphoon status on June 18 before finally weakening again a few hours later. The next day, Dianmu swung northward as the center was located 410\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) southeast of Okinawa. As it turned northward, dry air entered the storm causing the center to become ragged and eventually resulted in the storm weakening further as the winds dropped to 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) on June 19.[1] On June 20, the center of Dianmu bypassed Okinawa by 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) to the east as the storm continued to weaken. Satellite imagery showed the storm losing its deep convection and significant outflow and its winds dropped to 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). As the storm approached Japan, it interacted with a trough which was position northwest of the storm. The resulting interaction with the trough caused the storm to drop below typhoon status. As the storm edged closer to Japan, it began to gradually take on the characteristics of an extratropical cyclone before it made its first landfall in Shikoku before making its second landfall in Honsh\u016b on June 21. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final advisory on Dianmu at 1800 UTC while the JMA continued to issue advisories until June 23.[1] The extratropical remnants of Dianmu then dissipated over the Bering Sea on June 25.[6]"

The storm produced heavy rainfall, rough seas and gale-force winds but did little damage.[11] A weather station in Yap reported a 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph) gust.[12] Dianmu then brushed past Ulithi Atoll dropping 102.8\u00a0mm (4.01\u00a0inches) of rain over the atoll. A weather station in Palau reported 121.7\u00a0mm (4.76\u00a0inches) of rain from the Dianmu's passage.[1] Overall, there were no reported damage from Dianmu's impact on the Ulithi Atoll, Yap or Palau.[1] Several stations in Okinawa and other Japanese islands reported sustained winds of at least tropical storm force. A weather station in Okinawa reported the highest sustained winds of 104\u00a0km/h (64\u00a0mph). Another weather station in Kochi reported a wind gust of 206\u00a0km/h (128\u00a0mph) during Dianmus passage.[1] One fatality was reported in Okinawa when a surfer drowned in the rough seas.[8] In mainland Japan, Dianmu brought strong winds and heavy rainfall across southern, central and eastern portions of the country. A weather station in Owase recorded a 24\u2011hour rainfall total of 207.5\u00a0mm (8.14\u00a0inches).[1] In Cape Muroto, a weather station reported winds gusting to 177\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[9] High winds from Dianmu damaged power lines which left 25,000 residents without electricity.[9] The landfall of Dianmu also disrupted oil and crude shipments.[13][14] Elsewhere in Japan, Dianmu damaged or destroyed 79 homes and flooded 18 others.[15] Damage in Japan amounted to 6.85\u00a0billion JPY ($68\u00a0million 2004 USD, $73\u00a0million 2006 USD), mostly agricultural damage.[2] Dianmu's outer rainbands dropped heavy rainfall across southern and eastern parts of South Korea. A weather station in Jeju Island reported 295.5\u00a0mm (11.6\u00a0inches); another weather stations in South Korea recorded 150 - 184.7\u00a0mm (5.9 - 7.2\u00a0inches) of rain. The heavy rainfall from Dianmu resulted in moderate flash flooding as the rainfall caused the Nakdonggang River to overflow its banks.[10]\nThe floodwaters left two people dead and four more missing.[16]"

        "content": " The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a member of the genus Panthera and the largest living cat species native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands. Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their own. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims of human\u201a\u00c4\u00ecwildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is legally protected in all range countries. National conservation measures consist of action plans, anti-poaching patrols and schemes for monitoring tiger populations. In several range countries, wildlife corridors have been established and tiger reintroduction is planned. The tiger is among the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in captivity since ancient times and has been trained to perform in circuses and other entertainment shows. The tiger featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and has continued to appear in culture worldwide."

It was proposed to recognise only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris in mainland Asia and the smaller P. t. sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands.[11] This two-subspecies proposal was reaffirmed in 2015 through a comprehensive analysis of morphological, ecological and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) traits of all putative tiger subspecies.[10]\nIn 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy in accordance with the 2015 two-subspecies proposal and recognised only P. t. tigris and P. t. sondaica.[12] Results of a 2018 whole-genome sequencing study of 32 samples from the six living putative subspecies\u201a\u00c4\u00eethe Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian and Sumatran tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00eefound them to be distinct and separate clades.[13] These results were corroborated in 2021 and 2023.[14][15] The Cat Specialist Group states that \"Given the varied interpretations of data, the [subspecific] taxonomy of this species is currently under review by the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group.\"[16] The following tables are based on the classification of the tiger as of 2005,[9] and also reflect the classification recognised by the Cat Classification Task Force in 2017.[12]"

Results of genetic analyses indicate that the tiger and snow leopard are sister species whose lineages split from each other between 2.70 and 3.70 million years ago.[37] The tiger's whole genome sequencing shows repeated sequences that parallel those in other cat genomes.[38] The fossil species Panthera palaeosinensis of early Pleistocene northern China was described as a possible tiger ancestor when it was discovered in 1924, but modern cladistics places it as basal to modern Panthera.[39][40] Panthera zdanskyi lived around the same time and place, and was suggested to be a sister species of the modern tiger when it was examined in 2014.[39] However, as of 2023, at least two subsequent studies considered P. zdanskyi likely to be a synonym of P. palaeosinensis, noting that its proposed differences from that species fell within the range of individual variation.[41][42] The earliest appearance of the modern tiger species in the fossil record are jaw fragments from Lantion in China that are dated to the early Pleistocene.[39] Middle- to late-Pleistocene tiger fossils have been found throughout China, Sumatra and Java. Prehistoric subspecies include Panthera tigris trinilensis and P. t. soloensis of Java and Sumatra and P. t. acutidens of China; late Pleistocene and early Holocene fossils of tigers have also been found in Borneo and Palawan, Philippines.[43] Fossil specimens of tigers have also been reported from the Middle-Late Pleistocene of Japan.[44] Results of a phylogeographic study indicate that all living tigers have a common ancestor that lived between 108,000 and 72,000 years ago.[31] Genetic studies suggest that the tiger population contracted around 115,000 years ago due to glaciation. Modern tiger populations originated from a refugium in Indochina and spread across Asia after the Last Glacial Maximum. As they colonised northeastern China, the ancestors of the South China tiger intermixed with a relict tiger population.[28][27]"

        "header": "Hybrids",
        "content": "Tigers can interbreed with other Panthera cats and have done so in captivity. The liger is the offspring of a female tiger and a male lion and the tigon the offspring of a male tiger and a female lion.[45] The lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, so that ligers grow far larger than either parent species. By contrast, the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene while the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene; hence, tigons are around the same size as their parents.[46] Since they often develop life threatening birth defects and can easily become obese, breeding these hybrids is regarded as unethical.[45]"

Belly hairs tend to be longer than back hairs. The density of their fur is usually thin, though the Siberian tiger develops a particularly thick winter coat. The tiger has lines of fur around the face and long whiskers, especially in males.[47] It has an orange colouration that varies from yellowish to reddish.[55] White fur covers the underside, from head to tail, along with the inner surface of the legs and parts of the face.[47][56] On the back of the ears, it has a prominent white spot, which is surrounded by black.[47] The tiger is marked with distinctive black or dark brown stripes, which are uniquely patterned in each individual.[47][57] The stripes are mostly vertical, but those on the limbs and forehead are horizontal. They are more concentrated towards the back and those on the trunk may reach under the belly. The tips of stripes are generally sharp and some may split up or split and fuse again. Tail stripes are thick bands and a black tip marks the end.[56] The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species.[58] Stripes are advantageous for camouflage in vegetation with vertical patterns of light and shade, such as trees, reeds and tall grass.[57][59] This is supported by a Fourier analysis study showing that the striping patterns line up with their environment.[60]\nThe orange colour may also aid in concealment, as the tiger's prey is colour blind and possibly perceives the tiger as green and blended in with the vegetation.[61]"

The white tiger has a white background colour with sepia-brown stripes. The golden tiger is pale golden with reddish-brown stripes. The snow-white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale sepia-brown ringed tail. White and golden morphs are the result of an autosomal recessive trait with a white locus and a wideband locus, respectively. The snow-white variation is caused by polygenes with both white and wideband loci.[62] The breeding of white tigers is controversial, as they have no use for conservation. Only 0.001% of wild tigers have the genes for this colour morph and the overrepresentation of white tigers in captivity is the result of inbreeding. Hence, their continued breeding will risk both inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability in captive tigers.[63] Pseudo-melanistic tigers with thick, merged stripes have been recorded in Simlipal National Park and three Indian zoos; a population genetic analysis of Indian tiger samples revealed that this phenotype is caused by a mutation of a transmembrane aminopeptidase gene. Around 37% of the Simlipal tiger population has this feature, which has been linked to genetic isolation.[64]"

Unclaimed home ranges, particularly those that belonged to a deceased individual, can be taken over in days or weeks.[57] Male tigers are generally less tolerant of other males within their home ranges than females are of other females. Disputes are usually solved by intimidation rather than fighting. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, as long as they do not come near him. The most serious disputes tend to occur between two males competing for a female in oestrus.[94] Though tigers mostly live alone, relationships between individuals can be complex. Tigers are particularly social at kills and a male tiger will sometimes share a carcass with the females and cubs within this home range and unlike male lions, will allow them to feed on the kill before he is finished with it. However, a female is more tense when encountering another female at a kill.[95][96]"

Males also use the flehmen to detect the markings made by tigresses in oestrus.[47] Tigers will move their ears around to display the white spots, particularly during aggressive encounters and between mothers and cubs.[99] They also use their tails to signal their mood. To show cordiality, the tail sticks up and sways slowly, while an apprehensive tiger lowers its tail or wags it side-to-side. When calm, the tail hangs low.[100] Tigers are normally silent but can produce numerous vocalisations.[101][102] They roar to signal their presence to other individuals over long distances. This vocalisation is forced through an open mouth as it closes and can be heard 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi) away. They roar multiple times in a row and others respond in kind. Tigers also roar during mating and a mother will roar to call her cubs to her. When tense, tigers moan, a sound similar to a roar but softer and made when the mouth is at least partially closed. Moaning can be heard 400\u00a0m (1,300\u00a0ft) away.[47][103] Aggressive encounters involve growling, snarling and hissing.[104] An explosive \"coughing roar\" or \"coughing snarl\" is emitted through an open mouth and exposed teeth.[47][104][99] In friendlier situations, tigers prusten, a soft, low-frequency snorting sound similar to purring in smaller cats.[105] Tiger mothers communicate with their cubs by grunting, while cubs call back with miaows.[106] When startled, they \"woof\". They produce a deer-like \"pok\" sound for unknown reasons, but most often at kills.[107][108]"

        "content": "The tiger is a carnivore and an apex predator feeding mainly on large and medium-sized ungulates, with a preference for sambar deer, Manchurian wapiti, barasingha, gaur and wild boar.[109][110][111]\nAbundance and body weight of prey species are assumed to be the main criteria for the tiger's prey selection, both inside and outside protected areas.[112]\nIt also preys opportunistically on smaller species like monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, porcupines and fish.[47][57] Occasional attacks on Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceroses have also been reported.[113]\nMore often, tigers take the more vulnerable calves.[114]\nThey sometimes prey on livestock and dogs in close proximity to settlements.[47] Tigers occasionally consume vegetation, fruit and minerals for dietary fibre and supplements.[115] Tigers learn to hunt from their mothers, though the ability to hunt may be partially inborn.[116] Depending on the size of the prey, they typically kill weekly though mothers must kill more often.[54] Families hunt together when cubs are old enough.[117] They search for prey using vision and hearing.[118] A tiger will also wait at a watering hole for prey to come by, particularly during hot summer days.[119][120] It is an ambush predator and when approaching potential prey, it crouches with the head lowered and hides in foliage. It switches between creeping forward and staying still. A tiger may even doze off and can stay in the same spot for as long as a day, waiting for prey and launch an attack when the prey is close enough,[121] usually within 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft).[54] If the prey spots it before then, the cat does not pursue further.[119] A tiger can sprint 56\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) and leap 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft);[122][123] it is not a long-distance runner and gives up a chase if prey outpaces it over a certain distance.[119] The tiger attacks from behind or at the sides and tries to knock the target off balance. It latches onto prey with its forelimbs, twisting and turning during the struggle and tries to pull it to the ground. The tiger generally applies a bite to the throat until its victim dies of strangulation.[47][124][125][126] It has an average bite force at the canine tips of 1234.3 newtons.[127] Holding onto the throat puts the cat out of reach of horns, antlers, tusks and hooves.[124][128] Tigers are adaptable killers and may use other methods, including ripping the throat or breaking the neck. Large prey may be disabled by a bite to the back of the hock, severing the tendon. Swipes from the large paws are capable of stunning or breaking the skull of a water buffalo.[129] They kill small prey with a bite to the back of the neck or head.[130][54] Estimates of the success rate for hunting tigers range from a low of 5% to a high of 50%. They are sometimes killed or injured by large or dangerous prey like gaur, buffalo and boar.[54] Tigers typically move kills to a private, usually vegetated spot no further than 183\u00a0m (600\u00a0ft), though they have been recorded dragging them 549\u00a0m (1,801\u00a0ft). They are strong enough to drag the carcass of a fully grown buffalo for some distance. They rest for a while before eating and can consume as much as 50\u00a0kg (110\u00a0lb) of meat in one session, but feed on a carcass for several days, leaving little for scavengers.[131]"

Interactions between the three predators involve chasing, stealing kills and direct killing.[132] Large dhole packs may kill tigers.[133] Tigers, leopards and dholes coexist by hunting different sized prey.[134] In Nagarhole National Park, the average weight for tiger kills was found to be 91.5\u00a0kg (202\u00a0lb), compared to 37.6\u00a0kg (83\u00a0lb) for leopards and 43.4\u00a0kg (96\u00a0lb) for dholes.[135] In Kui Buri National Park, following a reduction in prey numbers, tigers continued to kill favoured prey while leopards and dholes increased their consumption of small prey.[110] Both leopards and dholes can live successfully in tiger habitat when there is abundant food and vegetation cover.[134][136] Otherwise, they appear to be less common where tigers are numerous. The recovery of the tiger population in Rajaji National Park during the 2000s led to a reduction in leopard population densities.[137] Similarly, at two sites in central India the size of dhole packs was negatively correlated with tiger densities.[138] Leopard and dhole distribution in Kui Buri correlated with both prey access and tiger scarcity.[139] In Jigme Dorji National Park, tigers were found to inhabit the deeper parts of forests while the smaller predators were pushed closer to the fringes.[140]"

        "content": " The tiger generally mates all year round, particularly between November and April. A tigress is in oestrus for three to six days at a time, separated by three to nine week intervals.[47] A resident male mates with all the females within his home range, who signal their receptiveness by roaring and marking.[141][142] Younger, transient males are also attracted, leading to a fight in which the more dominant, resident male drives the usurper off.[143][141] During courtship, the male is cautious with the female as he waits for her to show signs she is ready to mate. She signals to him by positioning herself in lordosis with her tail to the side. Copulation typically lasts no more than 20 seconds, with the male biting the female by the scruff of her neck. After it is finished, the male quickly pulls away as the female may turn and slap him.[141] Tiger pairs may stay together for up to four days and mate multiple times.[144] Gestation lasts around or over three months.[47] A tigress gives birth in a secluded location, be it in dense vegetation, in a cave or under a rocky shelter.[145] Litters consist of as many as seven cubs, but two or three are more typical.[143][145] Newborn cubs weigh 785\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1,610\u00a0g (27.7\u201a\u00c4\u00ec56.8\u00a0oz) and are blind and altricial.[145] The mother licks and cleans her cubs, suckles them and viciously defends them from any potential threat.[143] Cubs open their eyes at the age of three to 14 days and their vision becomes clear after a few more weeks.[145] They can leave the denning site after two months and around the same time they start eating meat.[143][146] The mother only leaves them alone to hunt and even then she does not travel far.[147] When she suspects an area is no longer safe, she moves her cubs to a new spot, transporting them one by one by grabbing them by the scruff of the neck with her mouth.[148]\nA tigress in Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve maximised the time spent with her cubs by reducing her home range, killing larger prey and returning to her den more rapidly than without cubs; when the cubs started to eat meat, she took them to kill sites, thereby optimising their protection and access to food.[149]\nIn the same reserve, one of 21 cubs died in over eight years of monitoring and mortality did not differ between male and female juveniles.[150]\nTiger monitoring over six years in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve indicated an average annual survival rate of around 85 percent for 74 male and female cubs; survival rate increased to 97 percent for both males and female juveniles of one to two years of age.[151]\nCauses of cub mortality include predators, floods, fires, death of the mother and fatal injuries.[148][152][153][151] After around two months, the cubs are able to follow their mother. They still hide in vegetation when she goes hunting. Young bond through play fighting and practice stalking. A hierarchy develops in the litter, with the biggest cub, often a male, being the most dominant and the first to eat its fill at a kill.[154] Around the age of six months, cubs are fully weaned and have more freedom to explore their environment. Between eight and ten months, they accompany their mother on hunts.[117] A cub can make a kill as early as 11 months and reach independence as a juvenile of 18 to 24 months of age; males become independent earlier than females.[155][151] Radio-collared tigers in Chitwan started leaving their natal areas at the age of 19 months.[89] Young females are sexually mature at three to four years, whereas males are at four to five years.[47] Generation length of the tiger is about 7\u201a\u00c4\u00ec10 years.[156]\nWild Bengal tigers live 12\u201a\u00c4\u00ec15 years.[157] Data from the International Tiger Studbook 1938\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2018 indicate that captive tigers lived up to 19 years.[158] The father does not play a role in raising the young, but he encounters and interacts with them. The resident male appears to visit the female\u201a\u00c4\u00eccub families within his home range. They socialise and even share kills.[159][160] One male was recorded looking after cubs whose mother had died.[161] By defending his home range, the male protects the females and cubs from other males.[162] When a new male takes over, dependent cubs are at risk of infanticide as the male attempts to sire his own young with the females.[163] A seven-year long study in Chitwan National Park revealed that 12 of 56 detected cubs and juveniles were killed by new males taking over home ranges.[153]"

Though tiger hunting was prohibited in 1977, the population continued to decline and is considered extinct in South China since 2001.[173][174] Tiger populations in India have been targeted by poachers since the 1990s and were extirpated in two tiger reserves in 2005 and 2009.[175]\nBetween March 2017 and January 2020, 630 activities of hunters using snares, drift nets, hunting platforms and hunting dogs were discovered in a reserve forest of about 1,000\u00a0km2 (390\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in southern Myanmar.[176] Nam Et-Phou Louey National Park was considered the last important site for the tiger in Laos, but it has not been recorded there at least since 2013; this population likely fell victim to indiscriminate snaring.[177] Anti-poaching units in Sumatra's Kerinci Seblat landscape removed 362 tiger snare traps and seized 91 tiger skins during 2005\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2016; annual poaching rates increased with rising skin prices.[178]\nPoaching is also the main threat to the tiger population in far eastern Russia, where logging roads facilitate access for poachers and people harvesting forest products that are important for prey species to survive in winter.[179] Body parts of 207 tigers were detected during 21 surveys in 1991\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2014 in two wildlife markets in Myanmar catering to customers in Thailand and China.[180]\nDuring the years 2000\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2022, at least 3,377 tigers were confiscated in 2,205 seizures in 28 countries; seizures encompassed 665 live and 654 dead individuals, 1,313 whole tiger skins, 16,214 body parts like bones, teeth, paws, claws, whiskers and 1.1\u00a0t (1.1 long tons; 1.2 short tons) of meat; 759 seizures in India encompassed body parts of 893 tigers; and 403 seizures in Thailand involved mostly captive-bred tigers.[181] Seizures in Nepal between January 2011 and December 2015 obtained 585 pieces of tiger body parts and two whole carcasses in 19 districts.[182] Seizure data from India during 2001\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2021 indicate that tiger skins were the most often traded body parts, followed by claws, bones and teeth; trafficking routes mainly passed through the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Assam.[183]\nA total of 292 illegal tiger parts were confiscated at US ports of entry from personal baggage, air cargo and mail between 2003 and 2012.[184] Demand for tiger parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine has also been cited as a major threat to tiger populations.[185]\nInterviews with local people in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans revealed that they kill tigers for local consumption and trade of skins, bones and meat, in retaliation for attacks by tigers and for excitement.[186]\nTiger body parts like skins, bones, teeth and hair are consumed locally by wealthy Bangladeshis and are illegally trafficked from Bangladesh to 15 countries including India, China, Malaysia, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan and the United Kingdom via land borders, airports and seaports.[187]\nTiger bone glue is the prevailing tiger product purchased for medicinal purposes in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.[188] \"Tiger farm\" facilities in China and Southeast Asia breed tigers for their parts, but these appear to make the threat to wild populations worse by increasing the demand for tiger products.[189] Local people killing tigers in retaliation for attacking and preying on livestock is a threat in several tiger range countries, as this consequence of human\u201a\u00c4\u00ecwildlife conflict also contributes to the decline of the population.[190][191][192][193][194]"

These policies have led to many years of \"zero poaching\" and the country's tiger population has doubled in a decade.[196]\nAnti-poaching patrols in the 1,200\u00a0km2 (460\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) large core area of Taman Negara lead to a decrease of poaching frequency from 34 detected incidents in 2015\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2016 to 20 incidents during 2018\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2019; the arrest of seven poaching teams and removal of snares facilitated the survival of three resident female tigers and at least 11 cubs.[212]\nArmy and police officers are deployed for patrolling together with staff of protected areas in Malaysia.[196] Wildlife corridors are important conservation measures as they facilitate tiger populations to connect between protected areas; tigers use at least nine corridors that were established in the Terai Arc Landscape and Sivalik Hills in both Nepal and India.[213]\nCorridors in forested areas with low human encroachment are highly suitable.[214][215]\nIn West Sumatra, 12 wildlife corridors were identified as high priority for mitigating human\u201a\u00c4\u00ecwildlife conflicts.[216]\nIn 2019, China and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding for transboundary cooperation between two protected areas, Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park and Land of the Leopard National Park, that includes the creation of wildlife corridors and bilateral monitoring and patrolling along the Sino-Russian border.[217] Rescued and rehabilitated problem tigers and orphaned tiger cubs have been released into the wild and monitored in India, Sumatra and Russia.[84][218][219]\nIn Kazakhstan, habitat restoration and reintroduction of prey species in Ile-Balkash Nature Reserve have progressed and tiger reintroduction is planned for 2025.[220]\nReintroduction of tigers is considered possible in eastern Cambodia, once management of protected areas is improved and forest loss stabilized.[221] South China tigers are kept and bred in Chinese zoos, with plans to reintroduce their offspring into remote protected areas.[15][116] Coordinated breeding programs among zoos have led to enough genetic diversity in tigers to act as \"insurance against extinction in the wild\".[222]"

Modern authors speculate that sustaining on meagre human flesh forced the cat to kill more and more.[230] Tiger attacks were particularly high in Singapore during the mid-19th century, when plantations expanded into the tiger's habitat.[231] In the 1840s, the number of deaths in the area ranged from 200 to 300 annually.[232] Tiger attacks in the Sundarbans caused 1,396 human deaths in the period 1935\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2006 according to official records of the Bangladesh Forest Department.[233] Victims of these attacks are local villagers who enter the tiger's domain to collect resources like wood and honey.

In ancient Rome, tigers were displayed in amphitheatres; they were slaughtered in venatio hunts and used to kill criminals.[235] The Mongol ruler Kublai Khan is reported to have kept tigers in the 13th century. Starting in the Middle Ages, tigers were being kept in European menageries.[236] Tigers and other exotic animals were mainly used for the entertainment of elites but from the 19th century onward, they were exhibited more to the public. Tigers were particularly big attractions and their captive population soared.[237] In 2020, there were over 8,000 captive tigers in Asia, over 5,000 in the US and no less than 850 in Europe.[238] There are more tigers in captivity than in the wild.[222] Captive tigers may display stereotypical behaviours such as pacing or inactivity. Modern zoos are able to reduce such behaviours with exhibits designed so the animals can move between separate but connected enclosures.[239] Enrichment items are also important for the cat's welfare and the stimulation of its natural behaviours.[240] Tigers have played prominent roles in circuses and other live performances. Ringling Bros included many tiger tamers in the 20th century including Mabel Stark, who became a big draw and had a long career. She was well known for being able to control the tigers despite being a small woman; using \"manly\" tools like whips and guns. Another trainer was Clyde Beatty, who used chairs, whips and guns to provoke tigers and other beasts into acting fierce and allowed him to appear courageous. He would perform with as many as 40 tigers and lions in one act. From the 1960s onward, trainers like Gunther Gebel-Williams would use gentler methods to control their animals. Sara Houcke was dubbed \"the Tiger Whisperer\" as she trained the cats to obey her by whispering to them.[241] Siegfried & Roy became famous for performing with white tigers in Las Vegas. The act ended in 2003 when a tiger attacked Roy during a performance.[242] In 2009, tigers were the most traded circus animals.[243] The use of tigers and other animals in shows would eventually decline in many countries due to pressure from animal rights groups and greater desires from the public to see them in more natural settings. Several countries restrict or ban such acts.[244] Tigers have become popular in the exotic pet trade, particularly in the United States[245] where only 6% of the captive tiger population in 2020 were being housed in zoos and other facilities approved by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.[189] Private collectors are thought to be ill-equipped to provide proper care for tigers, which compromises their welfare. They can also threaten public safety by allowing people to interact with them.[189] The keeping of tigers and other big cats by private people was banned in the US in 2022.[246] Most countries in the European Union have banned breeding and keeping tigers outside of licensed zoos and rescue centres, but some still allow private holdings.[247]"

In a 2004 online poll involving more than 50,000 people from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog.[248] Similarly, a 2018 study found the tiger to be the most popular wild animal based on surveys, as well as appearances on websites of major zoos and posters of some animated movies.[249] While the lion represented royalty and power in Western culture, the tiger played such a role in various Asian cultures. In ancient China, the tiger was seen as the \"king of the forest\" and symbolised the power of the emperor.[250] In Chinese astrology, the tiger is the third out of 12 symbols in the Chinese zodiac and controls the period between 15:00 and 17:00 o'clock in the afternoon. The Year of the Tiger is thought to bring \"dramatic and extreme events\". The White Tiger is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations, representing the west along with the yin and the season of autumn. It is the counterpart to the Azure Dragon, which conversely symbolises the east, yang and springtime.[251] The tiger is one of the animals displayed on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The big cat was depicted on seals and coins during the Chola dynasty of southern India, as it was the official emblem.[252] Tigers have had religious and folkloric significance. In Buddhism, the tiger, monkey and deer are the Three Senseless Creatures, with the tiger symbolising anger.[253] In Hinduism, the tiger is the vehicle of Durga, the goddess of feminine power and peace, whom the gods created to fight demons. Similarly, in the Greco-Roman world, the tiger was depicted being ridden by the god Dionysus. In Korean mythology, tigers are messengers of the Mountain Gods.[254] In both Chinese and Korean culture, tigers are seen as protectors against evil spirits and their image was used to decorate homes, tombs and articles of clothing.[250][255][256] In the folklore of Malaysia and Indonesia, \"tiger shamans\" heal the sick by invoking the big cat. People turning into tigers and the inverse has also been widespread; in particular weretigers are people who could change into tigers and back again. The Mnong people of Indochina believed that tigers could shapeshift into humans.[256] Among some indigenous peoples of Siberia, it was believed that men would seduce women by transforming into tigers.[250] William Blake's 1794 poem \"The Tyger\" portrays the animal as the duality of beauty and ferocity. It is the sister poem to \"The Lamb\" in Blake's Songs of Innocence and of Experience and he ponders why God would create such different creatures. The tiger is featured in the mediaeval Chinese novel Water Margin, where the cat battles and is slain by the bandit Wu Song, while the tiger Shere Khan in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894) is the mortal enemy of the human protagonist Mowgli. The image of the friendly tame tiger has also existed in culture, notably Tigger, the Winnie-the-Pooh character and Tony the Tiger, the Kellogg's cereal mascot.[257]"

Fourteen people died and thousands were made homeless when floodwaters poured over the top of the Thames Embankment and part of the Chelsea Embankment collapsed. It was the last major flood to affect central London, and, along with the disastrous North Sea flood of 1953, helped lead to the implementation of new flood control measures that culminated in the construction of the Thames Barrier in the 1970s."

        "header": "Causes of the flood",
        "content": "During Christmas 1927, heavy snow fell in the Cotswolds in west-central England, where the Thames has its source. A sudden thaw occurred over New Year's Eve, followed by unusually heavy rain, doubling the volume of water coming down the river. The sudden rise in water level coincided with a high spring tide and a storm surge caused by a major extra-tropical cyclone in the North Sea. The storm surge raised the water levels in the Thames Estuary, measured at Southend, to 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) above normal.[4] The funnelling of the water further up the river caused its level to rise even higher. The situation was worsened by capital dredging that had been carried out between 1909 and 1928, deepening the river channel by about 2 metres (6.6 feet) to allow access for deeper-draughted vessels to the Port of London. This had the side-effect of making it easier for seawater to flow up the Thames on a high tide, increasing the flow on a mean tide by about 4% and raising the tidal range by about 0.7 metres (2.3 feet).[5] This produced the highest water levels ever recorded in the Thames in London. The flood peaked at about 1:30 am on 7 January when a level of 5.55 metres (18\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches) above the datum line was recorded, nearly a foot higher than the previous record.[6] Extensive flooding resulted as the river overflowed the Embankments from the City of London and Southwark up to Putney and Hammersmith.[4] Serious flooding was also reported in Greenwich, Woolwich and other locations further downriver, causing major property damage.[7][8]"

        "header": "Consequences",
        "content": "The damage caused by the flood took several years to repair. Millbank, the most seriously affected area, was largely rebuilt from scratch; many of the run-down dwellings and warehouses that had characterised the area were so badly damaged that they had to be demolished, while the rest were torn down as part of the area's post-flood regeneration. They were replaced with modern office blocks and apartment buildings. Imperial Chemical House (designed by Sir Frank Baines, the Principal Architect of the Government's Office of Works) was one of the new buildings constructed in the area in 1927\u201329. The current headquarters of MI5, Thames House, was built to a very similar (though not identical) design in 1929\u20131930 on the other side of Horseferry Road, with the two buildings forming a landmark pair of office blocks facing the river.[9] A new Lambeth Bridge was constructed to replace its dilapidated predecessor, and Horseferry Road was widened to afford access to the bridge. The height of the Embankments was raised and the river wall was strengthened along substantial parts of the river. Proposals were made for the construction of a Thames flood barrier, but these came to nothing, due to concerns that such a barrier would impede shipping access to the London docks. The flood of January 1928 was the last major flood in the city centre, although the North Sea flood of 1953 came within millimetres of overtopping the Embankment, and did flood Bermondsey and some other low-lying parts of the city. Another flood affected the lower Thames in 1959. In response to the threat of such floods happening again, plans were made in the mid-1960s to build a flood barrier on the Thames to guard against the threat of storm surges. By then, much of London's shipping had moved to Tilbury Docks further downriver, greatly reducing the navigational difficulties that a barrier would present. The Thames Barrier project finally got under way in 1974, with the barrier officially opening in 1984."

        "content": "A considerable area of the city centre was flooded by this unprecedented combination of events. The first section of the riverbank to give way was opposite the Tate Gallery at Millbank, where a 75-foot (23\u00a0m) section of the Chelsea Embankment collapsed. The gallery was flooded almost to the tops of the doors on the ground floor (a depth of between five and eight feet 1.5\u00a0to 2.4\u00a0m),[10] which caused damage to many paintings in the gallery's collections, most notably those of J. M. W. Turner.[10][11] Near Lambeth Bridge the embankment gave way, sending a wall of water through a generally poor and run-down area; there, nine people drowned (and one died of a heart attack brought on by shock) in their basement apartments, unable to escape from where they were living. Another two people died in Hammersmith, and two more in Fulham.[11] Another 4,000 Londoners were made homeless[11] as water filled the streets to a depth of four feet (1.2\u00a0m).[4] Westminster Hall and the House of Commons were also flooded, as were the London Underground stations and lines along the riverside. The moat at the Tower of London, which had been empty for over 80 years, was refilled by the river, and the Blackwall and Rotherhithe Tunnels were submerged.[12] Other buildings that flooded were Lots Road Power Station and Wandsworth Gas Works.[11] The Manchester Guardian described the scene on the morning of 7\u00a0January: Remarkable scenes were witnessed all along the Embankment. At the Houses of Parliament the water \"cataracted\" over the parapet into the open space at the foot of Big Ben. The floods penetrated into Old Palace Yard, which shortly after one o'clock was about a foot under water in parts. Flooding was worst at Charing Cross and Waterloo bridges, where the river sweeps round. Water poured over the Embankment, and the road was covered in a depth of several inches. At intervals along the Embankment stood tramcars derelict and deserted. Later attempts were made to tow them through the floods by means of motor-lorries. Taxicabs and motor-cars splashed along the far side of the road. The public subway, Westminster Bridge, was flooded to a depth of four feet. There were miniature waterfalls at Cleopatra's Needle and the Royal Air Force Memorial, and the training ship President floated at street level.[13] The flood was short-lived, and the waters subsided by the end of the day. However, it took considerably longer to drain the many roads, tunnels, basements and cellars that had been flooded.[14]"

It was not named by the National Hurricane Center as it was operationally classified as an extratropical low. It developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, an unusual region for late-season tropical cyclogenesis. Nonetheless, the system was able to generate a well-defined centre convecting around a warm core on 4\u00a0October. The system was short-lived, crossing over the Azores later on 4\u00a0October before becoming extratropical again on 5\u00a0October. No damages or fatalities were reported during that time. Its remnants were soon absorbed into a cold front. That system went on to become Hurricane Vince, which affected the Iberian Peninsula.

Upon reclassification, the storm was entered into HURDAT, the official hurricane database."

        "content": "The system originated out of an upper-level low just west of the Canary Islands on 28\u00a0September. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest. On 3\u00a0October, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (740 kilometres; 460 miles) southwest of S\u00e3o Miguel Island in the Azores.[1] Early on 4\u00a0October, convection increased as the surface low organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression.[2] Around the same time, the depression turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the area, the storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on 5\u00a0October, the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day.[2] The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on 8\u00a0October.[3] At the time, the system was not believed to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that the system was indeed one. The first finding was the cloud pattern, which had deep convection around the centre and was better organized with a well-defined centre of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system,[4] until an unrelated cold front passed the Azores.[5] Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was only subtropical.[2]"

        "content": "In the first week of December, a westward-moving upper-level low led to the formation of a broad surface trough well to the east of the northern Lesser Antilles.[1][2] With a strong ridge to its northeast, the trough tracked slowly westward, producing scattered convection and some cyclonic turning.[2] On December 8 convection began to persist in association with the trough and an upper-level low.[3] Early on December 9, officials at the Tropical Prediction Center began classifying the system using the Hebert-Poteat technique,[4] and several tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated its development of tropical characteristics.[5] The system, which consisted of a sharp trough with an area of gale force winds to its north, continued westward through an area of moderately warm sea surface temperatures.[6] On December 10 a low-level circulation developed within the system, though its convection had become disorganized and well-removed from the center.[7] Southerly wind shear left the structure asymmetric,[8] and convection steadily increased closer to the center. With an upper-level low situated just south of the center, the National Hurricane Center classified it as Subtropical Storm Olga at 0300\u00a0UTC on December 11 while located about 55\u00a0miles (85\u00a0km) east of San Juan, Puerto Rico.[9] Upon being classified as a subtropical cyclone, Olga maintained well-defined outflow, and located to the southeast of a strong ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean, the cyclone tracked west-southwestward.[9] The storm strengthened slightly while paralleling the north coast of Puerto Rico,[10] before later making landfall over the north central coast of Puerto Rico at 0700 UTC on December 11.[11] After an increase in convection near the center, Olga transitioned into a tropical storm and made landfall near Punta Cana, Dominican Republic at 1800\u00a0UTC on December 11 at peak intensity.[11] Operationally, it was thought that the storm had transitioned to a tropical cyclone while over land, after a Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm reported a tighter wind gradient and peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[12] Convection rapidly weakened as the storm crossed central Hispaniola, and upon reaching the Caribbean Sea the system lacked the convection required for the classification of a tropical cyclone; rainbands well to its northeast maintained stronger winds, though the center became ill-defined with dry air and strong wind shear.[13] Late on December 12, convection increased slightly over the center, though by that time the cyclone weakened to tropical depression status.[14] As significant convection failed to persist, the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Olga earlier on December 13 while located about 80\u00a0miles (130\u00a0km) northwest of Kingston.[15] Its remnants continued west-northwestward with a clear low-level circulation, producing scattered thunderstorms over Cuba and the Cayman Islands with its moisture extending northward into southern Florida.[16] A small cluster of deep convection developed just east of the center, and the low-level circulation remained well-defined as it approached the coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[17] The remnants of Olga turned northward into the Gulf of Mexico as a cold front approached the center from the northwest.[18] Late on December 16 and early on December 17, the low intensified as it approached the west coast of Florida, with sustained winds of tropical storm force, and gusts to hurricane force, being reported at Clearwater Beach.  Ultimately, the approaching cold front absorbed the low as it moved across the Florida peninsula.[1] The cold front was associated with a powerful winter storm that affected much of Eastern America during that weekend and killed at least 25 across six US states and three Canadian provinces tapped Olga's moisture, drawing it northeastward mainly offshore the East Coast."

Extended periods of heavy rainfall also resulted in flash flood warnings for portions across the island.[22] Ferry service between Fajardo and the islands of Culebra and Vieques was temporarily suspended during the passage of the storm.[23] In the Dominican Republic, officials opened shelters in 15\u00a0provinces, with citizens in low-lying areas recommended to stay elsewhere during the passage of the storm;[24] citizens in 22\u00a0communities were evacuated.[25]"

Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400\u00a0UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6\u00a0million\u00a0gallons (6.1\u00a0million\u00a0liters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66\u00a0foot (20\u00a0m) wave of water that caught many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15\u00a0minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35\u00a0people[27] and left homes in seven towns flooded.[28] Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000\u00a0people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500\u00a0houses were damaged.[29] Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5\u00a0billion (2007\u00a0DOP, $45\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD).[30] In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country.[31] On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h).[32] While still moving through the western Caribbean sea, heavy rains fell along a trough in its northeast quadrant beginning on December 14, with a total of 7.08\u00a0inches/179.8\u00a0mm falling at Nettles Island, Florida.  The remnant low intensified due to occasional convection forming near and northeast of the center as it approached the Sunshine State.  Clearwater Beach recorded a pressure as low as 1002\u00a0mb as well as sustained winds reaching 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 78\u00a0mph (126\u00a0km/h) between 4 and 5 on the morning of December 16.  As a cold front approached, the low pressure area became ill-defined and dissipated before reaching Florida's Space Coast.[1]"

        "content": "On October 6, 2006, the first concerns of a possible lake-effect snow (LES) event were raised, as medium and long range numerical weather models began to indicate conditions would be potentially favorable for lake effect precipitation, resulting in mixed snow-rain conditions. The long term forecast from the Buffalo office of the National Weather Service (NWS), as well as the Environment Canada discussion, both indicated possible LESs, but predicted that accumulations would be minimal.[7] By October 9, however, forecasters became concerned, given the high snow fall rates typical of snow squalls, accumulations would be possible even with temperatures above the freezing mark.[8][9] The Buffalo NWS and associated weather offices in the U.S and Canada did not issue any special advisories or make significant mention of the possibility of a major snow fall event until early afternoon on October 11.[7] The NWS Buffalo issued a special advisory for the possibility of LES with minor accumulations of less than 2 inches (5.1\u00a0cm). Environment Canada followed suit issuing a special weather advisory for Canadian areas which would also be affected. The warm front associated with the developing low pressure system brought rain and thunderstorms to much of western New York and southern Ontario since the early morning hours of the 11th. The quickly approaching cold front passed the Port Colborne reporting station in Ontario at 11:35 pm EST October 11[10] and the Buffalo Airport reporting station at 12:46 am EST October 12. With the passage of the cold front, polar continental air began to flood in behind it, and by 3:30 am EST, a lake effect squall began to form over Lake Erie in the strong westerly winds. The first lake effect rain was reported at 3:54 am EST at the Buffalo Airport. The morning of October 12 saw the first deep concern among forecasters that a large snowfall event was possible.[7] Indications at the time were still mainly that of a rainfall event with ice pellets and some wet snow mixed in. Towards the afternoon of the October 12, a warning was issued by the NWS Buffalo for the possibility of one to six inches of wet snow. Environment Canada also released a similar warning, advising the public that conditions like those found in typical winter LESs were possible, although only minor accumulation was expected, if any. On that day, the NWS Buffalo dubbed the storm \"Lake Storm Aphid\", in accordance with their naming scheme for lake-effect storms for that year.[3] The first reports of ice in the form of small hail and ice pellets were reported at the Buffalo Airport at 12:14 pm,[11] the temperature at the time was 41\u00a0\u00b0F (5\u00a0\u00b0C) after which it fell to 37\u00a0\u00b0F (3\u00a0\u00b0C) by 1:00 pm and 36\u00a0\u00b0F (2\u00a0\u00b0C) by 1:38 pm.[11] Then at 1:51 pm, the first rain-snow mix was reported, and by 2:09 pm the rain had changed over entirely to snow, with the temperature dropping to 33.8\u00a0\u00b0F (1.0\u00a0\u00b0C) by 2:13 pm.  This prompted the NWS in Buffalo to issue a LES warning at 2:36 pm for Niagara, Orleans, Northern Erie and Genesee counties.[12] The warning, which would become effective as of 8:00 pm through to 6:00 am, called for one to three inches of snow, with possible accumulations of up to 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) well inland; the warning also made specific mention of possible tree damage and power outages.[12] The changeover to snow resulted from increased mixing within the squall; as colder air continued to flood in from the west, the atmosphere continued to destabilize vertically as the temperature difference between the lake water and the air several kilometers above grew larger. This allowed the squall to grow vertically in height and achieve much faster updraft speeds.  At the 2:54 pm, radar indicated the first 20,000\u00a0ft (6,100\u00a0m) echo-top; at the same time, lightning was detected. Despite heavy snow at times, accumulation was limited to grassy areas and locations which were not in direct contact with the ground, such as tree branches and power lines. The first notable ground accumulations started to occur just after 4:54 pm, when snow fall rates jumped to 1 inch per hour (2.5\u00a0cm/h) within thunderstorms inside the squall. At 6:48 pm, the NWS decided to update the LES warning, making it effective immediately and  emphasizing extensive tree damage and the loss of power was imminent. By 8:00 pm, numerous reports of downed trees and power lines, and other damage began to flood the NWS Buffalo offices; by this time 3\u00a0in (7\u00a0cm) had accumulated on the ground. As much as 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) fell in the Buffalo area, but in the nearby greater Toronto area, there was no snowstorm at all."

        "content": "The storm's effects were highly localized: it dumped up to 2 feet (61\u00a0cm) of snow on some areas of the Buffalo metro region, while other areas saw very little snow, or no snow at all. The event was described by the NWS Office in Buffalo, New York, as \"astounding\", \"unbelievable\" and \"incredible\" and by the Toronto Star as \"one of the most devastating snow storms in US history\".[2][14] It was also an example of the \"particularly rare meteorological phenomenon\" known as thundersnow. These were the two snowiest October days recorded in Buffalo since the NWS began keeping track 137 years ago. In affected areas, wet, heavy lake effect snow with a snow-water equivalent (SWE) ratio of between 6:1 and 12:1 (in comparison, the \"powder\" so prized by skiers is 25:1) and with a weight in excess of 9.8 pounds per square foot)[15] piled onto trees which were still in full leaf, leading to significant damage [to trees] on a scale usually associated with hurricanes.[2] An estimated 400,000\u00a0people were without power on Friday the 13th,[16] some 100,000 households remained without power for a week,[17] and a few thousand remained without power for ten days.[18] During the power outage, whenever generators went on sale, they typically ran out within thirty minutes.  Lowe's and Home Depot stores were sold out immediately after the storm hit. Despite the conditions, a Buffalo Sabres hockey game against the New York Rangers was not postponed at HSBC Arena despite the power outage, and the game still had a full attendance of 18,690. Effects of the storm were responsible for three fatalities between Thursday night, when the storm hit, and Friday morning, two from automobile accidents, and one from a falling branch. Ten more deaths followed in the first days of the aftermath, some from pre-existing health (usually heart) conditions and other causes, and several from carbon monoxide poisoning. Injuries blamed on the storm and its aftermath numbered in the several hundred and included those from chainsaw accidents and carbon monoxide poisoning due to people running generators inside homes.[19] Conservative initial damage estimates to clean up the estimated 6 to 8.6\u00a0million cubic yards of debris were at least US$130\u00a0million,[19][20] but even ten days after the storm hit, estimates of the number of tons of debris and the final costs of clearing them were \"a moving target\".[21]\nThe storm closed the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport for several hours on Thursday, October 12, and again on Friday, October 13, and closed a 100-mile (160-km) stretch of the New York State Thruway for several hours on Friday, October 13. Many, if not most, businesses were closed for at least a few days, and schools for at least a week. Most schools reopened on Monday, October 23, after six consecutive \"snow days\", but a few in the most heavily affected areas reopened later that week.[22] Affected parts of Erie, Genesee, Orleans and Niagara counties in Western New York were declared a \"major disaster\" area by President George W. Bush on October 24, 2006.[23] As many as 90 percent of the city's trees were estimated to be damaged,[24][25] including many in the city's cherished parks and parkways, which were designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The damage constituted a significant setback to Buffalo's \nurban reforestation agenda,[26] which had aimed to increase the city's tree canopy from its estimated 2003 levels of 12% to more closely approach the national average of 30%. Buffalo's suburbs, also hard hit by the storm, do have a canopy cover approaching 20 to 30%.[27] Although the two-foot snow cover melted by October 15,[28] cleanup efforts were impeded in the first days after the storm by the tangle of fallen trees, fallen branches and downed power lines: power grid crews could not reach the downed power lines because of fallen trees, and tree removal crews could not clear debris because of the dangers of the downed power lines.[29] Even after roads were cleared and power was restored, the cleanup and restoration was estimated to take weeks or months.[18][30]"

        "content": "Each jurisdiction had very similar Emergency Operation Plans and this made for a very consistent manner in how activities such as clean-up and response would be organized.  Initially, the snow of this storm began to fall just like any other day in the winter season throughout the Buffalo region.  Local fire departments were the first to respond to tree limbs blocking road ways, car accidents, and other incidents on top of \"usual calls for help\".  As the storm worsened, police departments had officers staged at major intersections to help in the direction of traffic.  Highway departments were called back into work to assist in the removal of tree limbs off roadways.  At this point the snow started to come down at a heavier rate and the crews could not keep up with the trees that were obstructing roadways.  As a result, plows could not get through to clear the snow and the whole region was \"stranded in place\".  Falling tree limbs greatly contributed to the loss of electricity in all municipalities affected.  Downed power lines that were charged also prevented people from driving over them (plowing of the streets).  Local departments soon became overwhelmed and requested assistance from the town and city disaster co-coordinators.  Requests were made to Erie County for assistance and then up to the state level.  \"On October 13, 2006, New York Governor George Pataki declared a state of emergency for Erie, Niagara, Genesee and Orleans Counties and dispatched State equipment and crews to assist in clearing debris.  Local mayors and town supervisors also declared states of emergency in their respective municipalities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency initially issued a temporary disaster declaration allowing for federal assistance, including financial, for local governments, but which did not address or provide for assistance to individual households affected by the Storm.\"(Szukala). From here the governor declared a state of emergency and eventually received a presidential declaration which declared a federal state of emergency.  The Emergency Operations Plan allowed for effective communication between agencies which helped the disaster run in a smoother manner.[3]"

A total of 32 states of local emergency were declared[5] and 28 emergency operations centres were activated[6] as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders.[7] Five people were confirmed dead as a direct result of the flooding and over 100,000 people were displaced throughout the region. Some 2,200 Canadian Forces (CF) troops were deployed to help in flooded areas in addition to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Alberta Sheriffs Branch response. Total damage estimates exceeded C$5 billion and in terms of insurable damages, made the 2013 Alberta floods the costliest disaster in Canadian history at $1.7 billion, until the occurrence of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire.

A high-pressure system in northern Alberta blocked the passage to a low-pressure area to the south, 19\u201321 June. This blocked circulation and easterly winds pumped humidity on the rising slopes of the Rocky Mountains foothills, causing heavy rain into the province with rainfall amounts of over 200 millimetres (7.9\u00a0in) to fall in less than two days[when?] in many regions of the province, particularly west and southwest of Calgary. In Canmore, a town in Alberta's Rockies, over 220 millimetres (8.7\u00a0in) fell in just 36 hours,[when?] nearly half of the town's annual average rainfall.[9] In the town of High River, rainfall amounts at one weather station recorded 325 millimetres (12.8\u00a0in) in less than 48 hours. The rain falling on already saturated ground, coupled with the steep watershed and heavy snow loads remaining in the front ranges of the Rocky Mountains, resulted in a rapid increase in the size and flow of several rivers.[10] At the peak of the flooding, the Bow and Elbow rivers were flowing through Calgary at three times their peak levels from a 2005 flood that caused C$400 million in damages.[9] Within 48 hours,[clarification needed] by 8 a.m. MDT on June 21, the flow rate on the Bow River had reached 1,458 cubic metres (51,489 cubic ft.) per second (m3/s), five times its normal rate for this time of the year. The Elbow and Highwood rivers reached flow rates of 544 m3/s (inside Calgary) and 734 m3/s respectively, ten times their averages for this time of year.[11] According to data tracked by Alberta's Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Resource Development,[12][13][notes 1] \"in the space of a day or two, the flows of the three rivers rocketed up five to 10 times their normal rates.\"[when?][14]"

That same day, the river also reached a record high flow rate of 1,750\u00a0m3/s (62,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).[24] Through social media,[notes 3] websites and blogs[notes 4] with a constant stream of updated contributions from the Calgary's mayor,[notes 5] numerous city councillors,[notes 6] the Calgary Police, media at all levels, and numerous Calgarians with Twitter,[notes 7] Flickr and Facebook accounts, the flood was extremely well-covered.[19][25][26][notes 8] The city's largest indoor arena, the Scotiabank Saddledome, was among the facilities damaged as flood waters were reported to have filled up to the first ten rows of the lower seating bowl.[27]  The Calgary Stampede grounds adjacent to the arena were also severely flooded, less than two weeks before the scheduled opening of the annual exhibition and rodeo, however officials vowed the event would go on.[28] While emergency officials began to announce the partial lifting of some evacuation orders on June 22,[29] Mayor Naheed Nenshi stated that it would be several days before power could be restored to the downtown core.[30] City workers, assisted by Canadian Forces personnel from The Calgary Highlanders, reinforced a particularly large erosion of river bank near 8th Avenue S.E., which endangered several houses in the neighbourhood of Inglewood.[31][32] Calgary's central business district, home to many of Canada's oil company headquarters, remained inaccessible until June 26.[33] A spokesman for Imperial Oil, Canada's second-largest producer and refiner, said the company was working on plans to maintain essential operations, including allowing employees to work from other locations.[33] Shorcan Energy Brokers, which provides live prices for many Canadian crude grades, operated out of Toronto on June 21 rather than at its usual Calgary base, although no trades in either Western Canada Select heavy blend or light synthetic crude from the oil sands were executed.[33] Net Energy Inc, the other main Calgary crude broker, was closed on Friday, June 21, and there was no trading.[33] As the water began to recede, the city lifted evacuation orders for several communities.  It allowed 65,000 residents to return to their homes and business on June 23 to assess for damage, but parts of 14 communities remained off-limits.[34] On June 27, the Bonnybrook Bridge collapsed under the weight of a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train. One of the pilings of the 101-year-old rail bridge had been scoured by floodwaters on the Bow River and undermined. CPR officials said that because the scour occurred underwater, they had not been able to inspect it, due to river conditions. However, rail regulations require the ability to inspect underwater.[35] The buckled bridge caused the train to derail. As the train was carrying hazardous petrochemicals, an evacuation was ordered for the local area and regions downstream, and the train was slowly pumped dry.[36]"

All 13,000 residents of High River were ordered to evacuate on June 20, and the community was largely abandoned within three days as the town suffered what local officials called \"unprecedented\" damage.[40] Among internationally recognized sites flooded in High River was the \"Maggie's Diner\" standing set for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) series Heartland.[41] During the state of emergency in High River, the RCMP entered numerous homes in the area and seized hundreds of firearms, along with magazines and ammunition. Although the RCMP claimed that it only seized firearms that were in plain view, many residents have complained that their firearms were well hidden, and that the RCMP caused significant damage inside homes while searching for firearms. There are further complaints that RCMP members subjected homes to second or even third searches in their quest for firearms in plain view.[42] The Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP concluded that the RCMP had exceeded its authority by seizing firearms that were properly secured or not in plain view, by not keeping proper records of the damage caused when they broke into homes, and by failing to report the seizure of firearms to a justice of the peace. The report concluded that, although they were not legally required to do so, communicating adequately with the public during the crisis would have prevented much confusion among partners and anger among residents.[43] While residents of other communities were returning and beginning their cleanup, High River remained off limits a week after the flooding first hit.  Residents grew increasingly frustrated at what they perceived as a lack of communication from local officials, particularly the lack of a timeline to return.[44] Officials argued the town remained unsafe; some residences remained accessible only to divers, while E. coli had been discovered in the water.[45] The neighbourhood of Beechwood estates, with many luxury homes worth over a million dollars, was among those hard hit by the flood. The Province of Alberta decided to purchase 94 homes located in designated floodways (including the 32 in Beechwood), demolish most of them and return the area to its natural state as a floodplain. Twenty-six of the houses were auctioned off for relocation.[46][47]"

The bureau called the cost \"staggering\", and said the figure continued to rise.[63] The Albertan government granted the Siksika nation $93M to rebuild their communities; $10M of this grant would be used to train and upgrade the vocational skills needed to perform construction repairs.[64]"

On September 5, the fire hopped over the Columbia River into Washington state, near Archer Mountain.[15] The fire trapped 153 hikers and forced them to stay overnight six miles up the trail, trapped on the other side by the Indian Creek Fire. The first rescuer, a Forest Service ranger named Sharon, reached the hikers around 10\u00a0p.m. An attempt to drop supplies to the hikers, and to airlift out the youngest children, was aborted because the narrow terrain and night made the maneuver too hazardous. The hikers\u2014who generally had been on a hot summer day hike\u2014huddled together and tried to sleep on the bare ground. Several additional staff from the Forest Service and the Hood River Crag Rats arrived overnight with space blankets and some provisions. The next morning, Crag Rats, Pacific Northwest Search and Rescue, along with Mountain Wave Search and Rescue, escorted the hikers out to Wahtum Lake and bussed them back to the Eagle Creek Trailhead.[3] The community of Cascade Locks, Oregon was the first to experience mandatory evacuations, with 283 structures, including 15 businesses, being threatened by the fire. Salmon hatcheries at Cascade Locks were forced to release 600,000 fish six months earlier than expected.[16] The fire also threatened historic structures in the Eagle Creek Day Use Area, specifically those built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.[17] The fire also threatened the Multnomah Falls Lodge, which was saved by water tenders.[18] As of September 27, the Eagle Creek Fire had burned 48,665 acres (197\u00a0km2) and was 46% contained.

It also affected parts of southwest Washington, Idaho, and Nevada.[1][3] In Oregon, 17 or 18 people died as a result of the disaster, and it caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.[3] The flooding on the Willamette covered 152,789 acres (61,831.5\u00a0ha).[4] The National Weather Service rated the flood as the fifth most destructive weather event in Oregon in the 20th\u00a0century.[5] California Governor Pat Brown was quoted as saying that a flood of similar proportions could \"happen only once in 1,000 years,\" and it was often referred to later as the Thousand Year Flood.[1] The flood killed 19 people, heavily damaged or completely devastated at least 10 towns, destroyed all or portions of more than 20 major highway and county bridges, carried away millions of board feet of lumber and logs from mill sites, devastated thousands of acres of agricultural land, killed 4,000 head of livestock, and caused $100\u00a0million in damage in Humboldt County, California, alone.[6][7]"

This melted the snow, but left the soil frozen and impermeable.[8] Some places received the equivalent of a year's rain in just a few days. Albany received 13 inches (330\u00a0mm) of rain in December, almost double its average December rainfall of 7 inches (200\u00a0mm).[3] Detroit recorded an extra 18 inches (460\u00a0mm) of rain, and at Crater Lake, where the average normal December rainfall is 12 inches (300\u00a0mm), there was over 38 inches (970\u00a0mm) of rain.[clarification needed][3] As rivers and streams overflowed and the soil became saturated, mudslides occurred, roads closed, and reservoirs overflowed.[3] Many towns were isolated.[3] By the end of the flood, every river in Oregon was above flood stage, and more than 30 major bridges were impassable.[3]"

Hospital staff, parks department employees, and inmates from the Oregon State Penitentiary placed sandbags around the hospital to prevent floodwaters from coming in. Eventually, the flooding coupled with a loss of power led to the decision to evacuate patients to Salem General Hospital on Center Street. 121 patients were evacuated from Salem Memorial by hospital staff, doctors, ambulance crews, and the National Guard. The hospital was able to reopen five days later after extensive work to repair the flooding damage.[10] The Southern Pacific (SP) rail line between Portland and San Francisco was out of service for eighteen days as crews repaired damage from landslides near the 4,885-foot (1,489\u00a0m) Cascade Summit; and the parallel Willamette Pass highway was blocked for several days. Salt Creek washed out 25 miles (40\u00a0km) of Oregon Route 58 and undermined the SP viaduct footings. Landslides covered 700 feet (210\u00a0m) of SP track near Oakridge, and swept away 130 feet (40\u00a0m) of the Noisy Creek bridge 20 miles (32\u00a0km) north of Crescent Lake. The Willamette River washed out 300 feet (91\u00a0m) of SP track between Portland and Albany.[11]"

Riverside communities like Klamath, Orleans, Myers Flat, Weott, South Fork, Shively, Pepperwood, Stafford, and Ti-Bar were completely destroyed by flood waters; some of them were never rebuilt and none regained their former status. Metropolitan, Rio Dell, and Scotia were significantly damaged.[7] The Pacific Lumber Company sawmill at Scotia lost 40\u00a0million board feet (94,000\u00a0m3) of logs and lumber washed downstream.[12] Crescent City, still recovering from the tsunami created by the 1964 Alaska earthquake only nine months earlier, also suffered from the floods.[7] Over 22 inches (550\u00a0mm) of rain fell on the Eel River basin in a span of two days. By December 23, 752,000 cubic feet per second (21,300\u00a0m3/s) of water rushed down the Eel River at Scotia (still upstream from the confluence of the Van Duzen River),[6] 200,000 cubic feet per second (5,660\u00a0m3/s) more than the 1955 flood, and more than the average discharge of the entire Mississippi River basin.[13] Just under 200,000 cubic feet per second (5,660\u00a0m3/s) of water flowed down the South Fork Eel River alone, causing severe damage along its entire length.[6] Every stream gauge on the Eel River was destroyed[7] except the one at Fernbridge[14] where the bridge survived the flood. The flood crest at Miranda was 46 feet (14\u00a0m). Signs were later placed on top of tall poles to mark the unusual height of the water.[15] The Smith River, located in Del Norte County near the Oregon border, reached flows of 228,000 cubic feet per second (6,460\u00a0m3/s) at Hiouchi,[16] easily surpassing the 1955 flood's previous record of 165,000 cubic feet per second (4,670\u00a0m3/s).[7] The town of Gasquet received 26.6 inches (676\u00a0mm) of rain over an eight-day period, and Crescent City received 9.2 inches (230\u00a0mm).[7] The Klamath River reached flows of 557,000 cubic feet per second (15,800\u00a0m3/s),[17] submerging the town of Klamath under 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) of water.[7] The Trinity River, one of the Klamath's largest tributaries, also flooded and wrought destruction along its length. The Trinity, however, did not break the 1955 flood's records because of the newly constructed Trinity Dam, which stored 372,200 acre-feet (459,100,000\u00a0m3) of runoff from the storm.[7] Nonetheless, 231,000 cubic feet per second (6,540\u00a0m3/s) of water rushed down the river at Hoopa.[18] Between December 20 and December 26, 10,390,000 acre-feet (12.82\u00a0km3) of water flowed into the Pacific Ocean from the combined rivers and streams on the North Coast (of California).[7]"

The fifteenth tropical or subtropical cyclone and fourteenth named storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole developed on October 10 near Bermuda from a broad surface low that developed as a result of the interaction between an upper level trough and a decaying cold front. The storm turned to the northeast, passing close to Bermuda as it intensified to reach peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on October 11. Deep convection developed near the center of the system as it attempted to become a fully tropical cyclone. However, it failed to do so and was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone late on October 11. Nicole dropped moderate amounts of rainfall in Bermuda, while rough seas caused problems for cruise lines. In Canada, the remnants of the storm combined with an extratropical storm to produce strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused damage to trees and power lines. The remnant storm also produced gale-force winds across New England, while swells from the storm provided welcome surf conditions along the East Coast of the United States."

        "content": "An upper-level trough and a decaying cold front persisted across the western Atlantic Ocean in early October. The interaction between the two led to the formation of an area of low pressure on October 8 to the southwest of Bermuda. The system lacked a single well-defined circulation, though it possessed gale-force winds as it moved northwestward.[1] The system gradually became better organized,[2] and though there were no signs of tropical development on October 9, computer models suggested a subtropical storm could form.[3] On October 10, a well-defined low-level circulation developed as a band of clouds formed in the northern portion of the system. Shortly thereafter, curved bands developed in the northwestern portion of the center, while the strongest winds associated with the storm occurred more than 115 miles (185\u00a0km) from the center. Based on the broad wind field and the cloud signature, it is estimated the system organized into Subtropical Storm Nicole on October 10 while located about 140 miles (230\u00a0km) southwest of Bermuda.[1] The first National Hurricane Center forecast on Nicole noted the development of convection over the western portion of the center, and that if the trend continued, transitioning into a tropical cyclone would be possible. The first discussion also predicted a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[4] A mid-level trough turned the storm northeastward, and early on October 11 it passed about 60 miles (97\u00a0km) northwest of Bermuda.[1] Shortly after passing Bermuda, Nicole developed persistent deep convection near the center, while Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit overpasses indicated the potential of a warm core within the system.[5] Though Nicole attempted to acquire tropical characteristics, strong upper-level wind shear prevented the transition. As the storm accelerated northeastward under the influence of a large extratropical cyclone south of Nova Scotia, it briefly reached peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Late on October 11, the circulation of Nicole became indistinguishable from the larger extratropical cyclone, and advisories on the system were discontinued at 18:00\u00a0UTC as Nicole was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone.[1]"

The agency also issued a Tropical Storm Watch shortly after the storm developed. All warnings were canceled after the storm passed the island. Winds on Bermuda peaked at 44\u00a0mph (71\u00a0km/h) in association with Nicole, while gusts peaked at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) prior to the storm developing.[1] Nicole and the precursor extratropical storm dropped heavy precipitation, amounting to 5.86 inches (149\u00a0mm) over a three-day period at the Bermuda International Airport. Thunderstorms were also reported on the island.[9] Poor weather conditions from Nicole forced the cancellation of several events at the tourist-driven Bermuda Music Festival, including acts by Isaac Hayes, Gerald Albright, and Anita Baker. Strong winds knocked down power lines, leaving over 1,800 homes and businesses without power. Unsettled conditions also resulted in airport delays.[10] High winds delayed or altered the courses of four cruise ships.[11] High waves of 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7\u00a0m) in height left several cruise ship passengers seasick; one sick passenger was rushed to a local hospital on Bermuda.[12] The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued seven bulletins on the storm, though the system only briefly entered the centre's response zone before it dissipated.[13] Due to moisture from Nicole combined with the extratropical storm, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for large portions of the Canadian Maritimes.[14] The remnants of Nicole combined with a powerful extratropical cyclone to produce strong winds across the Maritimes. Winds gusted to hurricane-force on western Cape Breton, with the strongest gusts reaching 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). The strong winds uprooted trees and downed power lines and combined with rough seas to cause cancellations for ferry crossings and restricted access to the Confederation Bridge. The storm complex also dropped over 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) of rainfall, causing flooding in eastern Nova Scotia. The storm's passage during the middle of apple harvest caused troubles for Annapolis Valley.[15] The remnants of Nicole combined with an extratropical system to produce strong winds in New England, with gusts of up to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). In Maine, the winds snapped branches off trees, and also downed trees and power lines. Power outages were reported, primarily in coastal portions of Washington and Hancock Counties.[16] Nicole produced moderate swells along the East Coast of the United States. Conditions for surfing were best in New York and Rhode Island, where swells of over 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) occurred.[17] Eleven ships reported tropical storm force winds in association with Subtropical Storm Nicole. The maximum recorded wind was 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) while the storm was at peak intensity, while the minimum recorded pressure was 995 mbar as Nicole was being absorbed by the extratropical storm.[1] Since 2002, subtropical storms have been assigned names from the predetermined list of names used for tropical cyclones. Nicole was the first named subtropical storm since the policy change that did not become a fully tropical cyclone. Hurricane Gustav in 2002 formed as and was named as a subtropical cyclone, although it later became a fully tropical cyclone and later strengthened into a hurricane. In 1972 and 1973, four subtropical storms were named using the Phonetic alphabet. All other subtropical cyclones remained unnamed.[18]"

The tornado, highly visible for most of its path, was at the time the most observed and best-documented tornado in recorded history; hundreds of people photographed or filmed the F3 tornado as it moved just west of Downtown Dallas. The film of this tornado is still known for its unusually high quality and sharpness, considering the photography techniques and technology of the 1950s.

        "content": "At around 4:30\u00a0p.m. CST (some sources say 4:15\u00a0p.m. CST), a tornado touched down in southern Dallas County, south of modern-day Interstate 20 near Redbird Airport, and traveled northward for about 45\u00a0minutes through the Dallas neighborhoods of Oak Cliff, Kessler Park, West Dallas (only 2.5\u00a0mi (4.0\u00a0km) west of Downtown Dallas) and Love Field before lifting over Bachman Lake, west of Dallas Love Field, just after 5:00\u00a0p.m. CST. As it first touched down, the tornado was barely visible, with only a debris cloud showing at the base of the thin funnel cloud. 13\u00a0minutes later, the tornado funnel became more visible and was seen clearly to touch the ground. The tornado reached its maximum intensity, likely in the upper range of F3, as it approached the Trinity River. In this area, between Singleton Boulevard and Riverside Drive, homes were completely swept off their foundations, and nearby railroad cars were overturned; while such damage would usually be consistent with F4 intensity, the homes had been poorly constructed, lacking wall studding and being \"set on piers 8 to 12\u00a0ft (2.4 to 3.7\u00a0m) on center.\" Thus the tornado was officially rated F3, which is consistent with photogrammetric estimates of 175-mile-per-hour (282\u00a0km/h) peak winds in the worst-damaged area. Some time after crossing the Trinity River, the tornado weakened, and shortly afterward passed over a parking lot about 3\u20444\u00a0mi (1.2\u00a0km) west of the U.S. Weather Bureau office at Dallas Love Field. The funnel then entered the rope stage and dissipated just north of Bachman Lake. In all, the Dallas tornado killed 10\u00a0and injured at least 200\u00a0(some sources say 216) others. Damage was estimated at $4\u00a0million (1957\u00a0USD). The tornado completely destroyed about 131\u00a0(some sources say 154) homes, badly damaged 111, and mildly damaged 287. Nearly 600\u00a0(some sources list 574) structures and more than 500\u00a0homes were damaged, including between nine and 28\u00a0permanent apartment buildings that were completely destroyed. Some businesses and schools were also damaged, but the Parkland Memorial Hospital was narrowly spared, as was Dallas Love Field. Another, though officially unconfirmed, tornado in Collin County, north of the city, may have briefly touched down just east of the dissipating Dallas tornado and caused damage. The Dallas tornado was heavily documented, filmed, and photographed by several eyewitnesses as it passed through residential and commercial areas of Dallas. Visible for much of its 17-mile (27\u00a0km) path, the tornado, at the time, was the most observed in recorded history: 125\u00a0observers produced thousands of photographs and hours of high-quality, 16-mm film measuring 2,000\u00a0ft (610\u00a0m) in length. The tornado was highly visible due to its slow, 30-mile-per-hour (48\u00a0km/h) forward speed, a lack of precipitation, and its coincidence with ideal, late-afternoon lighting. Occurring shortly before the end of the workday, the tornado passed just west of Downtown Dallas and was seen by many business and factory workers. Many TV studios had time to film the tornado from rooftops. A researcher from the Severe Weather Forecast Unit in Kansas City noticed that several old theories were proven false during the Dallas tornado. One of the theories was that all air and debris flowed inward into the funnel and then upward, but on the outside edges of the funnel debris and people were even lifted. WFAA-TV in Dallas produced a 30-minute documentary about the tornado about one week later. The tornado became the subject of several scientific papers analyzing the life cycle of and wind speed speeds in a tornado. Among the studies was the first-ever photogrammetric analysis of wind speeds in a tornado. The film of the tornado is still regarded as being of exceptionally high quality and sharpness. Additionally, structural surveys following this and the Fargo tornado later in the year provided data that contributed to the development of the Fujita scale.[32]"

As the cradle approached the shore, they noticed a cat leaping frantically from one corner to another, desperately maintaining balance. It turned out, the cat's acrobatics managed to keep the crib upright, preventing it from overturning. The cat allegedly succeeded so well that even the peacefully sleeping baby's bedding remained dry. The artist Lawrence Alma-Tadema captured this legend in his 1856 painting \"The Inundation of The Biesbosch\"."

Developing as a weak frontal wave on 8 January 1993, the system moved rapidly northeast. The combination of the absorption of a second low-pressure area to its southeast, a stronger than normal sea surface temperature differential along its path, and the presence of a strong jet stream aloft led to a rapid strengthening of the storm, with its central pressure falling to an estimated 914\u00a0hPa (914.0\u00a0mb; 26.99\u00a0inHg) on 10 January. Its strength was well predicted by forecasters in the United Kingdom, and warnings were issued before the low initially developed. Gale-force winds covered the far northern Atlantic between Western Europe and Atlantic Canada, due to the intensity of this storm, with hurricane-force winds confined near its centre of circulation. After reaching its peak intensity, the system weakened as it moved into the far northeast Atlantic, dissipating by 17 January. This storm caused severe blizzards across much of Scotland. It also led to the final breakup of the oil tanker MV Braer, from which the storm derived its name; it had been stranded in rocks off the Shetland Islands by a previous storm nearly a week beforehand."

        "content": "A weak frontal wave, a low-pressure system forming along a weather front with very strong temperature contrast, developed on the afternoon of 8 January to the southeast of Newfoundland with a central pressure of 1,008\u00a0hPa (29.8\u00a0inHg). The system moved at a quick pace to the east-northeast at around 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph), deepening slowly. As the storm tracked more northeasterly, development accelerated, and early on the morning of 9 January its central pressure had fallen to 988\u00a0hPa (29.2\u00a0inHg). A new low pressure area formed along the system's cold front to its south. By noon, the forward motion of the main cyclone accelerated to nearly 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and its central pressure began to bomb, then down to 974\u00a0hPa (28.76\u00a0inHg) as it passed through the far northern Atlantic. This strengthening was enhanced by a strong jet stream with measured winds of 440\u00a0km/h (270\u00a0mph),[1] and a stronger than normal sea surface temperature gradient along its path from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland towards Iceland.[2] The new low south of the main low strengthened quickly, and its central pressure dropped to 982\u00a0hPa (29.00\u00a0inHg). During the evening of 9 January, the main cyclone to the north continued to bomb out, with a central pressure down to 958\u00a0hPa (28.29\u00a0inHg). Soon afterwards, it absorbed the deepening low to its south and this merger caused a period of extreme intensification. By early morning of 10 January, the pressure at the strong cyclone's center had fallen to 926\u00a0hPa (27.34\u00a0inHg) northwest of Great Britain as it slowed its northeast motion. Hurricane-force winds of 122\u00a0km/h (76\u00a0mph) were recorded at a weather ship just to its southeast. Towards sunrise, the center of the cyclone lay 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Iceland. The system continued to slow as it turned north-northeast, reaching its estimated lowest pressure of 914\u00a0hPa (26.99\u00a0inHg) later that morning. Weather buoys in the region with identifiers of 44746 and 64043 were not designed to read pressures below 925\u00a0hPa (27.3\u00a0inHg), so when their pressures dropped to that reading, they stayed there until the storm moved away.[3] The system's strongest winds were within 280\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) of its centre. Early during the afternoon of 10 January, a tremendous pressure differential existed between the centre of the cyclone and a high-pressure area over Spain, which had a central pressure of 1,035\u00a0hPa (30.6\u00a0inHg). This caused an extensive area of gale-force winds which stretched from Newfoundland to Spain, and northeastwards between Greenland and northern Norway. A large area of hurricane-force winds existed within this area of gales. The centre of the low transcribed a loop before resuming a slow northeast motion into the far northeast Atlantic. However, the system began to weaken, and by the evening of January 10, its central pressure had risen to 920\u00a0hPa (27.17\u00a0inHg). By the evening of 12 January, its central pressure rose to 952\u00a0hPa (28.11\u00a0inHg). During the evening of 13 January, its central pressure rose to 961\u00a0hPa (28.38\u00a0inHg) while located in the far northeast Atlantic. Within four days, the low dissipated west of Norway.[3]"

Winds gusted to 194\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) at two locations: the weather ship Cumulus and North Rona, north of Scotland.[1] Wind gusts of over 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) were measured across northwest Scotland.[3]  The highest precipitation amount recorded with this system across Great Britain was 37.2 millimetres (1.46\u00a0in) at Cilfynydd in South Wales. Periods of rain impacted the British Isles early in the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day, with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain.[6] Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland.[1] Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours.[6] Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing temperature readings.[3] Wind and waves associated with this storm were too much for the tanker MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500\u00a0tons of light crude oil spilled into the ocean surrounding the islands.[1] The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks.[7]"

It was the last large storm flood in the north of the Netherlands. Floodwaters reached the towns and cities of Groningen, Zwolle, Dokkum, Amsterdam, and Haarlem. Many villages near the sea were devastated entirely, such as in the west of Vlieland and villages behind the sea dykes in Groningen Province.[3][4][5] The local communities had to cope with population loss, economic decline, and poverty. No area of the coast between the Netherlands and Denmark was spared. Everywhere, dyke breaches were followed by wide flooding of the flat country. Between T\u00f8nder in Slesvig and Emden in East Frisia, about 9,000 people drowned. The Netherlands had 2,500 victims. The worse-affected areas were in the County of Oldenburg, around Jever, Kehdingen, and the principality of East Frisia. Butjadingen lost 30% of its population. In all the affected coastal areas, a large number of cattle were lost. In East Frisia, 900 houses were washed away completely. The damage to dykes and sluices was immense. Survivors remained unaware of the fate of missing family members for a long time. For example, of 284 persons missing from Werdum in East Frisia, only 32 of them had been found by 5 February 1718.

Floods from the Ice Age eventually left these bedrocks, as well as others along the Columbia River Gorge exposed at the surface of the Earth.[4]\nIt is 70 feet (21 meters) high. Hat Rock was the first landmark passed by the Lewis and Clark Expedition once they reached the Columbia River, and is one of the few remaining sites that has not been submerged by the river. On October 19, 1805, Clark noted in his journal \"a rock on the Lard... resembling a hat\".[5][6] During the construction of the nearby McNary Dam in 1951, 175 acres were purchased by Oregon State Parks from Charles and Eileen Kirk for $5,000. Another 191 acres were leased from the Army Corps of Engineers in 1953, with 2 small additional parcels purchased in the following years.[5] On June 10, 2023, a wildfire began known as the Hat Rock Fire. It burned over 16,816 acres before being 100% contained by June 13.[7][8]"

In the state, the winds damaged some crops and power lines, but no serious damage was reported. The system became a tropical storm after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean before quickly transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on February\u00a04.

Winds were estimated at 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h), and it tracked rapidly northward, initially to the north-northwest. After passing near Canc\u00fan along the Yucatan Peninsula, it turned northeastward and brushed the northwest coast of Cuba. Early on February\u00a03, the storm approached Key West, and shortly thereafter moved ashore near Cape Sable, Florida. It quickly crossed the state, passing near Miami before emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean.[1] The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h), as well as sustained tropical storm force winds for about four hours; the station also recorded a barometric pressure of 1004\u00a0mbar (29.66\u00a0inHg).[2] After leaving Florida, the storm continued rapidly northeastward and transitioned into a tropical cyclone. Late on February\u00a03, it reached its peak strength with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). On February\u00a04, it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of North Carolina.[1] Around that time, gale-force winds extended 100 miles (160\u00a0km) to the east of the center.[3] Later that day, it passed over Cape Cod, and early on February\u00a05, it moved into eastern Maine. The Hurricane Research Division assessed the storm as losing its identity shortly thereafter, over New Brunswick.[1] However, a map produced by the U.S. Weather Bureau indicated that the storm continued northward into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and later crossed eastern Quebec and Labrador. By February\u00a06, it reached the ocean again, deepening to a minimum pressure of 988 millibars (29.2\u00a0inHg). At that point, the Weather Bureau track ended, and as such the ultimate fate of the storm is unknown.[4]"

The agency also issued a small craft advisory southward through Charleston, South Carolina.[5] Offshore, the storm produced winds of up to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h),[5] as well as waves up to 35 feet (11\u00a0m) in height. The combination of the winds and rough waves drove a freighter ashore along Portsmouth Island in the Outer Banks,[3] after the engine was damaged when water entered the fuel line.[5] The 26\u00a0person crew initially planned to evacuate, but they later decided to stay on the freighter as the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist.[3] The seas damaged a portion of the ship, but the entire crew was rescued without any injuries.[7] The storm later brushed New England, bringing rain, fog, warmer temperatures, and gusty winds. The combination resulted in downed power poles and tree limbs, leaving 10,000\u00a0houses without electricity.[3] The storm was described as a \"freak\", forming about three months after the end of the hurricane season. The chief forecaster at Miami U.S. Weather Bureau, Grady Norton, remarked that he was unsure how the cyclone developed.[5] It is the only tropical or subtropical storm on record during February, and was the earliest tropical cyclone to strike the United States.[1] Its structure initially was uncertain, and the storm was not included in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season summary published by the Miami Weather Bureau office.[8] Ultimately it was included in the tropical cyclone database. Had it been operationally treated as a tropical cyclone, it would have been named Tropical Storm Able.[1]"

It moved steadily towards the east-northeast at 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) passing through Tappan before devastating the southern edge of Port Huron some 20\u00a0minutes later (Grazulis, 1990) resulting in widespread F3 and F4\u00a0damage. Two people were killed in Port Huron and 68 more were injured. Close to 400\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed in the United States with monetary losses totalling $2.6\u00a0million ($24.4\u00a0million 2018 USD)(Grazulis, 1990).[1] Before crossing the St. Clair River into Canada, the parent thunderstorm dumped heavy amounts of rain and golf-ball-size hail on the city of Sarnia. This circumstance was credited with clearing the streets of motorists and pedestrians, thus reducing the potential number of tornado-related casualties.[2] By 5:45\u00a0p.m., however, the over 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) wide tornado roared into Canada[3] just south of Sarnia Harbour (Grazulis, 1990). Moving to the northeast, the tornado passed directly through the downtown area where nearly a hundred commercial buildings sustained damage. A four-floor hotel on the waterfront lost many of its upper floors, as did a furniture store on Christina Street. The auditorium of the Imperial Theatre completely collapsed.[4] Nearby however, a steel-reinforced telephone exchange building received minimal damage, as a result of its sturdy construction.[2] At least 150\u00a0homes on the more suburban outskirts of the city were damaged and in some instances reduced to rubble. Before exiting Sarnia, the tornado curved even further to the northeast and began to weaken, as its path narrowed to approximately 30\u00a0m (33\u00a0yd) across.[2] The nearby radio station CHOK was severely damaged by the tornado as well.[5] As it moved into rural Lambton and Middlesex Counties, more F4\u00a0damage was inflicted upon farmsteads and homes near Nairn, before the tornado dissipated south of Stratford around 7\u00a0pm EDT (Grazulis, 1990). This suggests a total path length exceeding 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi), though it is highly probable that this damage path was made up of more than one tornado, possibly as many as four.[6] At the very least, there were two other storm tracks that day both of which parallelled the Sarnia storm to its north and south.[2] One of these tracked from Strathroy to northeast of London whereas the other originated near Lambton Shores before weakening near St. Mary's. Significant tornado damage in the F2 to F4\u00a0range was also reported with these storms, and it is likely that these parent supercells were also of the cyclic variety. As many as nine individual tornadoes may have touched down during this outbreak.[6] Financial losses in Canada totalled $15\u00a0million; five people were killed, 48 were injured, and 500 were left homeless.[2][7] Overall, the tornado was on the ground for 2\u00a0hours and 39\u00a0minutes, tracked 75\u201390 miles (121\u2013145\u00a0km), and was 1\u20131.5 miles (1.6\u20132.4\u00a0km) wide at its peak. Seven people were killed, 117\u00a0others were injured, and damages were estimated $17.6\u00a0million (1953\u00a0USD).[2][7]"

In the days to come, radio stations in Detroit, Windsor, and London would aid in the relief effort by relaying messages and emergency information from CHOK to listeners around the region. Nevertheless, the work of local radio announcers such as Karl Monk at CHOK and Robin Busse at WTTH, who had kept listeners informed of the storm as it developed until their stations were knocked off the air, was credited for saving many lives. Both CHOK-AM (1070\u00a0kHz) and CHOK-FM (97.5\u00a0MHz) were knocked off the air; while the AM station returned to the air later that day, the FM station was never rebuilt and its licence was cancelled in 1957. CHOK would remain an AM-only station until adding an FM rebroadcaster 55\u00a0years later.[5]"

Whoever sought help and relief under his proactive supervision were promptly supported. Elephants and horses were also put in service for relief work by him.[13] A relief fund of 500,000 Rupees was borne by the state, and 1,000,000 more raised by public subscription, with the Nizam and Kishen Pershad making the largest donations.[8] The government declared an official holiday of ten days for people to deal with their own crises.

A dam was built under noted engineer Nawab Ali Nawaz Jung Bahadur in 1920 across the river, ten miles (16\u00a0km) upstream from the city, called Osman Sagar. In 1927, another reservoir was built on Esi (tributary of Musi) and named Himayat Sagar.

It brought a wintry mix, including a heavy snowstorm, to eastern Canada and Maine on the 19th. In the Gulf of Mexico, high wind speeds. A second winter storm developed in Texas and brought another round of heavy wintry precipitation from Arizona into the Great Lakes region.

The system generated a broad surface low pressure system, as well as clusters of atmospheric convection.[1] The next day, Alma made landfall on Nicaragua, pulling deep tropical moisture into the region. Upper level outflow was spreading outwards from the tropical storm with a high pressure system over the Caribbean.[2] A surface trough developed and extended from inland Honduras to just south of the Cayman Islands, which sparked further development of strong convection.[3] Later that day, the remnants of Alma merged with another tropical wave in the western Caribbean, which sparked the development of a new surface low.[4] On May 31, the remnants of Alma were situated along the coast of Belize as a 1004\u00a0mbar low-pressure system. A broad upper-level ridge was anchored over the Gulf of Honduras, which covered the entire region and maintained deep tropical moisture.[5] Satellite imagery and a NOAA buoy reported sustained tropical storm-force winds. Despite moving ashore, the system was named Tropical Storm Arthur about 45\u00a0mi (72\u00a0km) north-northwest of Belize City.[6] In post-analysis, it was determined that Arthur had developed more than 12\u00a0hours earlier, late on May 30, and made landfall early on May 31 with 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) winds in northeastern Belize.[4] While over land, Arthur maintained minimal tropical storm force winds, concentrated primarily over open waters to the east and northeast.[7] Despite being over land for several hours, the storm maintained a fairly organized structure. The storm contained a large low-level center, accompanied by convective banding, and was developing new convective cells. Initially, it was thought Arthur would continue generally westward due to a ridge to its north, and later re-intensify in the Bay of Campeche.[8] The associated thunderstorm activity became separated from the center of circulation,[9] and early on June 1, the center became difficult to locate due to becoming disorganized. It remained a tropical storm over land for nearly 24\u00a0hours before weakening to a tropical depression later that day.[10] While drifting southwestward over land, Arthur weakened further, and the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system late on June 1.[11] By June\u00a04, the remnants of Arthur were diminishing over southeastern Mexico without any redevelopment.[12] Thunderstorms briefly redeveloped two days later, as its associated circulation crossed over the Bay of Campeche into Veracruz,[13] although it dissipated soon after.[14]"

Also, ports were closed on the islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and in Chetumal.[15] Small boats were restricted from leaving some ports, but evacuations were deemed unnecessary.[16] Tropical storm warnings were issued as soon as the storm was first classified for the coast of Belize and the coast of Mexico south of Cabo Catoche, and remained in effect until Arthur weakened to a tropical depression.[4] While crossing Belize, Arthur dropped heavy rainfall, estimated as high as 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm).[4] The storm produced rainfall as far south as Belize City and kicked up strong surf on the island of Ambergris Caye.[15] Winds from Arthur forced the closure of two of Mexico's three main oil exporting ports in the Gulf of Mexico due to rough seas.[17] The storm's remnants, combined with recent heavy rains from Tropical Storm Alma, triggered flash flooding and caused rivers in southern and northern Belize to overflow.  The flooding damaged one bridge and one highway, and several other bridges were under water. One village was evacuated, and shelters in Corozal and Orange Walk were opened. In rural areas the electricity was cut off due to safety issues.[18] Dozens were stranded on their roof due to high water, and work to repair an important highway was halted when flood waters washed away the repaired section. Papaya plantations, shrimp farms and rice crops were also affected by the unsettled weather.[19] In all, about 100,000\u00a0people were affected by the flooding,[18] and nine fatalities were reported; five of which were directly attributed to Arthur.[20] A total of 714\u00a0houses were damaged,[4] and damage in Belize was estimated at $78\u00a0million (2008\u00a0USD).[20] British helicopters helped rescue stranded people following the storm, and Mexico provided a helicopter to help carry supplies to areas affected by the flooding. Prime Minister Dean Barrow declared a disaster area in southern Belize's Stann Creek Valley. Additionally, the government rushed food, water and clothing to about 13,000\u00a0people.[19] When Arthur later moved over Mexico, it dropped heavy rainfall, with a maximum 24-hour total of 8.34\u00a0in (212\u00a0mm) in Pijijiapan, Chiapas. There were no reports of damage or deaths in the country.[21] \nArthur was the first tropical storm to form in May in the Atlantic since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981, and the last until Tropical Storm Alberto in May 2012.[22]"

Approximately one-fifth of Pakistan's total land area was affected by floods, with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province facing the brunt of the damage and casualties (above 90% of all the deaths occurred in the province).[5][6][7][8] Nationwide, there were 1,985\u00a0deaths.[1] According to Pakistani government data, the floods directly affected about 20 million people, mostly by destruction of property, livelihood and infrastructure.[9] UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had initially asked for US$460 million (\u20ac420 million) for emergency relief, noting that the flood was the worst disaster he had ever seen. Only 20% of the relief funds requested had been received on 15 August 2010.[10] The U.N. had been concerned that aid was not arriving fast enough, and the World Health Organization reported that ten million people were forced to drink unsafe water.[11] The Pakistani economy was harmed by extensive damage to infrastructure and crops.[12] Damage to structures was estimated to exceed US$4 billion (\u20ac2.5 billion), and wheat crop damages were estimated to be over US$500 million (\u20ac425 million).[13] Total economic impact may have been as much as US$43 billion (\u20ac35 billion).[3][4]"

The increased convective activity during the premonsoon phase agrees with the projected increase in the intensity of heavy rainfall events over northern Pakistan. Large-scale circulation analysis reveals an upper-level cyclonic anomaly over and to the west of Pakistan[22]\u2013a feature empirically associated with weak monsoon. The analysis also suggests that the anomalous circulation in 2010 is not sporadic but rather is part of a long-term trend that defies the typical linkage of strong monsoons with an anomalous anticyclone in the upper troposphere.\nAn article in the New Scientist[23] attributed the cause of the exceptional rainfall to \"freezing\" of the jet stream, a phenomenon that reportedly also caused unprecedented heat waves and wildfires in Russia as well as the 2007 United Kingdom floods.[24] In response to previous Indus River floods in 1973 and 1976, Pakistan created the Federal Flood Commission (FFC) in 1977. The FFC operates under Pakistan's Ministry of Water and Power. It is charged with executing flood control projects and protecting lives and property of Pakistanis from the impact of floods. Since its inception the FFC has received Rs 87.8 billion (about US$900 million). FFC documents show that numerous projects were initiated, funded and completed, but reports indicate that little work has actually been done due to ineffective leadership and corruption.[25]"

On 30 July 500,000 or more people had been displaced from their homes.[26] On 30 July, Manuel Bessler, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, stated that 36 districts were involved, and 950,000 people were affected,[30] although within a day, reports increased that number to as high as a million,[31] and by mid-August they increased the number to nearly 20 million affected.[32] By mid-August, according to the governmental Federal Flood Commission (FFC), the floods had caused the deaths of at least 1,540 people, while 2,088 people had received injuries, 557,226 houses had been destroyed, and over 6 million people had been displaced.[25] One month later, the tally had risen to 1,781 deaths, 2,966 people with injuries, and more than 1.89 million homes destroyed.[9] The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial minister of information, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said \"the infrastructure of this province was already destroyed by terrorism. Whatever was left was finished off by these floods.\"[33] He also called the floods \"the worst calamity in our history.\"[34] Four million Pakistanis were left with food shortages.[35] The Karakoram Highway, which connects Pakistan with China, was closed after a bridge was destroyed.[36] The ongoing devastating floods in Pakistan will have a severe impact on an already vulnerable population, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In addition to all the other damage the floods caused, floodwater destroyed much of the health care infrastructure in the worst-affected areas, leaving inhabitants especially vulnerable to water-borne disease.[37] In Sindh, the Indus River burst its banks near Sukkur on 8 August, submerging the village of Mor Khan Jatoi.[35] Law and order disappeared, mainly in Sindh. Looters took advantage of the floods by ransacking abandoned homes using boats.[38] In early August, the heaviest flooding moved southward along the Indus River from severely affected northern regions toward western Punjab, where at least 1,400,000 acres (570,000\u00a0ha) of cropland were destroyed,[35] and toward the southern province of Sindh.[39] The affected crops included cotton, sugarcane, rice, pulses, tobacco and animal fodder. Floodwaters and rain destroyed 700,000 acres (3,000\u00a0km2) of cotton, 200,000 acres (800\u00a0km2) acres each of rice and cane, 500,000 tonnes of wheat and 300,000 acres (1,000\u00a0km2) of animal fodder.[40][41] According to the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association, the floods destroyed 2 million bales of cotton, which increased futures prices.[42][43] 170,000 citizens (or 70% of the population) of the historic Sindh town of Thatta fled advancing flood waters on 27 August.[44] By mid-September the floods generally had begun to recede, although in some areas, such as Sindh, new floods were reported; the majority of the displaced persons had not been able to return home.[9]"

The power infrastructure of Pakistan also took a severe blow from the floods, which damaged about 10,000 transmission lines and transformers, feeders and power houses in different flood-hit areas. Flood water inundated Jinnah Hydro power. The damage caused a power shortfall of 3.135 gigawatts.[45] Infectious diseases (e.g. gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, and skin diseases) due to lack of clean drinking water and sanitation pose a serious new risk to flood victims.[46][47] On 14 August, the first documented case of cholera emerged in the town of Mingora, striking fear into millions of stranded flood victims, who were already suffering from gastroenteritis and diarrhoea.[48][49][50] Pakistan also faced a malaria outbreak.[51] The International Red Cross reported that unexploded ordnance, such as mines and artillery shells, had been flushed downstream by the floods from areas in Kashmir and Waziristan and scattered in low-lying areas, posing a future risk to returning inhabitants.[52] The United Nations estimated that 800,000 people were cut off by floods in Pakistan and were only reachable by air. It also stated that at least 40 more helicopters are needed to ferry lifesaving aid to increasingly desperate people. Many of those cut off are in the mountainous northwest, where roads and bridges have been swept away.[53] By order of President Asif Ali Zardari, there were no official celebrations of Pakistan's 63rd Independence Day on 14 August, due to the calamity.[54]"

A major concern was that farmers would be unable to meet the fall deadline for planting new seeds in 2010, which implied a loss of food production in 2011, and potential long term food shortages.[55] The agricultural damage reached more than 2.9 billion dollars, and included over 700,000 acres (2,800\u00a0km2) of lost cotton crops, 200,000 acres (810\u00a0km2) of sugar cane and 200,000 acres (810\u00a0km2) of rice, in addition to the loss of over 500,000 tonnes of stocked wheat, 300,000 acres (1,200\u00a0km2) of animal fodder and the stored grain losses.[56][57] Agricultural crops such as cotton, rice, and sugarcane and to some extent mangoes were badly affected in Punjab, according to a Harvest Tradings-Pakistan spokesman. He called for the international community to fully participate in the rehabilitation process, as well as for the revival of agricultural crops in order to get better GDP growth in the future. In affected Multan Division in South Punjab, some people were seen to be engaging in price-gouging in this disaster, raising prices up to Rs 130/kg. Some called for Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited to write off all agricultural loans in the affected areas in Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pukhtunkhwa especially for small farmers.[58] On 24 September, the World Food Programme announced that about 70% of Pakistan's population, mostly in rural areas, did not have adequate access to proper nutrition.[59] Already resurgent in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, agricultural devastation brought on by the floods left Pakistan more susceptible to an increase in poppy cultivation, given the crop's resiliency and relatively few inputs.[60]"

As a result, Pakistan was unlikely to meet the International Monetary Fund's target budget deficit cap of 5.1% of GDP, and the existing $55 billion of external debt was set to grow.[84] Crop losses were expected to impact textile manufacturing, Pakistan's largest export sector. The loss of over 10 million head of livestock along with the loss of other crops would reduce agricultural production by more than 15%. Toyota and Unilever Pakistan said that the floods would sap growth, necessitating production cuts as people coped with the destruction. Parvez Ghias, the chief executive of Pakistan's largest automotor manufacturer Toyota, described the economy's state as \"fragile\". Nationwide car sales were predicted to fall as much as 25%, forcing automakers to reduce production in October\u20132010 from the prior level of 200 cars per day.

On 14 August, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Pakistan to oversee and discuss the relief efforts.[46][47] A Pakistani army spokesman said that troops had been deployed in all affected areas and had rescued thousands of people.[33] Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani visited the province and directed the Pakistan Navy to help evacuate the flood victims.[92] By early August, more than 352,291 people have been rescued.[93] By the end of August, the Relief Web Financial Tracking service indicated that worldwide donations for humanitarian assistance had come to $687 million, with a further $324 million promised in uncommitted pledges.[94] Since the early stages of the emergency, the United Nations had warned of a potential \"second wave of death\" that would result from post-flood disease and food shortages,[95][96] stating that 3.5 million children were at risk of death if they did not get assistance,[97] including due to cholera.[98][99] UN spokesperson Maurizio Giuliano stated that \"an already colossal disaster [was] getting worse and requiring an even more colossal response\",[100] referring to the relief operations as \"a marathon at sprint pace\"[101] and acknowledging shortcomings in the response insofar as the needs were outpacing available resources[102][103][104][105] also due to endless rains.[106][107][108] He indicated that the floods had a worse impact than several other recent natural disasters combined, and that they were the worst natural disaster in United Nations history.[109][110] According to UNOCHA, by 2011, a total of $2,653,281,105 had been raised in humanitarian support, the largest amount by the US (25.8%), followed by private individuals and organisations (13.4%) and Japan (11.3%).[111] With need for substantial support to repair infrastructure, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that the Pakistani government enlarge its tax base by asking the wealthy citizens of Pakistan to contribute more for their country; by that time both the US and the EU each had contributed about US$450 million, \u20ac395 million for the relief effort.[112]"

        "content": "The center Argentine region, primarily the C\u00f3rdoba Province, has a temperate climate with a low-humidity winter. Rainfall season is limited to the spring and summer, while winters usually lack rains. This has been changing to a more humid climate, according to some opinions, due to climate change.[10] During August 2020, the center region of Argentina experienced a drought, aggravated by an increase in winds, which favored the spread of wildfires.[11][12] Particularly, the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba Mountains Range went by over 100 days without rains,[11] with temperatures reaching 39\u00a0\u00b0C (102\u00a0\u00b0F).[6] The El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation phenomenon was, by September 2020, in a neutral phase, with an increase of a La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon likelihood.[13] The C\u00f3rdoba vegetation cover is composed of \"native mount\" species\u2014trees such as Prosopis (Spanish: algarrobos), pepper trees (molles), desert hackberries (talas), espinillos, and quebrachos\u2014thorny shrubs, and in mountain areas grasslands with dry grasses. This vegetation is a big combustion risk during the dry season.[14] Winter months usually harbor the most wildfires, with August being the month with the largest number of fires. In the 1999\u20132017 period, 5,528 fires stroke the C\u00f3rdoba Mountains, affecting 700,385 hectares (1,730,690 acres).[15] In the 21st century, the largest number of fires was registered in 2003, with 364 fires, and the biggest affected areas being recorded in 2013, with 106,206 hectares (262,440 acres).[15] 95% of wildfires in Argentina are a consequence of human action, some intentional and others caused by neglect or carelessness after bonfires, the dropping of cigarette butts, or the burning of trash getting out of control.[2][16][15] Some intentional fires are believed to have been started by ranchers to clean pastures for further agricultural or husbandry usage of lands, and others for real state use, such as the construction of gated communities.[12][17][18]"

They could drag ashes and burnt material, affecting drinkable water quality.[21] An agricultural state of emergency was declared in the affected areas, and relief packages were established.[25][26]"

The system rapidly gained strength in the open waters of the Pacific Ocean, gaining enough winds to be declared a tropical depression on the morning of August 29. The depression rapidly intensified, becoming a tropical storm within six hours. Now named Amy, the cyclone bent northeast around Saipan with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). After passing Saipan, Amy strengthened into a typhoon during the afternoon of August 30. Continuing to rapidly strengthen over water, Amy reached its peak wind speed of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) on the evening of September 1, far to the northeast of the Philippines. After peaking with a pressure of 935\u00a0millibars, the typhoon weakened back to 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h) and soon 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), which it sustained for several days.[1] Crossing to the northeast of Luzon, Amy maintained strength, rapidly approaching the island of Taiwan on September 4. The storm slowly weakened to a 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) typhoon off the coast of Taiwan, making landfall on September 5 near the city of Yilan City. Amy weakened over land slightly before making landfall near Fuzhou later that day. Amy crossed over mainland China for several days, slowly weakening into a minimal tropical storm before crossing back into the waters of the East China Sea near Yancheng. Amy strengthened back to winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) before weakening into a tropical depression off the coast of South Korea. The depression made landfall near Incheon on September 7, weakening over land. After crossing out into open waters, the remains of Amy became extratropical on September 8, affected by the cold air.[2] The extratropical remains of Amy continued northeast along the North Korean mainland, crossing the island of Sakhalin on September 9. The remains of Amy were lost off the eastern coast of Sakhalin on September 10, west of the Kamchatka Peninsula.[3]"

Because of this, research has shown that the old sediments are no longer a threat to ecosystems and the river will not have to be dredged and treated to control contamination.[4] The Ha! Ha!

The tornado formed over the Sandusky Bay during the late afternoon hours and hit the city of Sandusky where it killed eight and destroyed 100 homes and 25 businesses.[2] After moving east over Lake Erie for several miles, the tornado then struck the town of Lorain just west of Cleveland, where greater than 500 houses were destroyed and 1,000 others were damaged in addition to many businesses in the downtown area. At least 72 people were killed here, including 15 people inside a collapsed theater and eight others inside the bath house located where the tornado came onshore. This tornado still ranks among the deadliest in United States history.[2][3][4] There were uncertainties as to whether or not the Sandusky-Lorain tornado was a single tornado event due to the 25-mile path of the storm across Lake Erie between Sandusky and Lorain; however, many eyewitnesses reported a single storm crossing the lake before coming onshore again in Lorain.[5][2] Other tornadoes struck Castalia (Erie County), Huron Township (Erie County) and Geauga Lake (Portage County) in addition to Erie and Meadville in northwestern Pennsylvania. At least five additional people were killed by other tornadoes on the same day.[4]"

H. Pond, Director of Red Cross civilian relief, here early tonight. Colonel Pond announced that he had arranged for tents for 1,000 persons to be shipped directly to Lorain from Camp Perry. Eighty dead have been taken from the State Theatre (sic) in Lorain, the chief of police of Elyria reported at 9:30 to-night. Estimates of 300 dead and 1,500 injured are not exaggerated. The storm carried telegraph and telephone wires down with it, isolating Sandusky, Lorain and other points in the northern part of the State, making confirmation of reports impossible. A motorist who drove from Loraine (sic) notified the Cleveland Plain Dealer that not only was East Lorain demolished, but the city of Lorain itself was swept away. Reports received over crippled railroad wires from Sandusky late tonight state that between fifty and seventy-five persons were killed or drowned there today when the tornado struck that city. The Sandusky water works and several large buildings along the lake front were blown down. Considerable damage along the shore line east of Cedar Point is reported. Some Summer homes are said to have been blown down and several persons killed. Martial Law Declared in Lorain An automobile ferry plying between Sandusky and Marblehead broke loose from its moorings at Sandusky and struck a pier. Fifteen passengers on the ferry are reported to have been drowned. Martial law has been declared in Lorain by Mayor George Hoffman. Police deputized American Legion members to cooperate with them and the National Guard. Looting is said to be going on freely. Lorain is without water, light, telephones, and food, and has little gas. First reports received here from a staff correspondent of The Plain Dealer, who motored back to the first available telephone east of Lorain, were to the effect that 200 were killed in the collapse of the State Theatre at Lorain, and that forty other were dead in other parts of the city. Reports from various other sources place the number of the dead as high as 500. Rain continued to fall in Lorain for several hours. Confirmation of the collapse of the theatre and washout of the Black River bridge at Lorain was brought to Cleveland by A. Downer, conductor on the Lake Shore Electric Railway, the first eyewitness of the disaster to reach this city. Many women and children were killed, motorists told him. Practically every house on Broadway, the main street of the city east and west, was blown down, Downer reported, and automobiles were picked up and overturned on the sidewalks. Eyewitness Describes Scene The American Shipyards at Lorain are reported to have been razed. Two boats belonging to Henry Ford were reported to have broken loose. Reports here that small passenger steamers plying between Sandusky and Lake Erie Island resorts have been lost, but could not be confirmed late tonight. One of the first eyewitness stories of the cyclone to reach Cleveland was brought back by L.F. Forster of Bay Village. He was in Lorain within a few minutes after the cyclone struk and he walked over several blocks of the devastated area, saw unroofed buildings, fallen trees, and telephone poles, heard screams of some of the injured and afterward saw refugees fleeing the city. \"My wife and I and a party of friends were driving toward Lorain,\" he said. \"It must have been 5:30 when the storm struck. We were about three or four miles east of the city and a heavy rain was falling.\" Saw Fires in Wrecked Town. \"At a gasoline station we met another automobile that had stopped there. It had just come from Lorain and from the man and woman in it we learned there had been a cyclone. They said they had seen houses toppling over, roofs flying through the air, and trees and telephone poles mowed down as a by a huge scythe. \"Their car was a sedan. They said the wind blew so hard that they had to sit on the floor to keep it from shattering their ear drums. \"We drove on toward Lorain until a tangle of fallen trees made further progress impossible. Then we got out and walked into the town. \"The town was a wreck. I had an uncanny feeling as I looked at houses without roofs or without walls, as I picked my way through the wreckage in the streets. \"I recall looking into one house from which the front wall had been blown out. I could see into the bedrooms and noticed the beds stood there neatly made. In the distance we could see some houses in flames, although there appeared to be no general conflagration. \"The river bridge was demolished except for the footpath, which was still standing. People were running about excitedly in the streets, some of them with injured hands and legs. Many had been pinned under falling buildings and trees. \"One wall of a grocery had been demolished, and the merchandise was scattered over the street. We saw a moving picture theatre which had collapsed. The balcony had fallen across the doorway. Whether anybody was in the theatre or not I do not know. Some men were trying to reach any injured who might be inside. \"We left this scene of desolation and retracted our steps to the car. Driving back to Bay Village, we overtook a number of refugees who came pouring out of the city a few minutes after the storm struck. \"One of these was a man who said he owned a four-family apartment house which had been wrecked. Two people were found buried in the debris, he said. \"We met a man hurrying toward Lorain, who besought us for news. He said his wife and family were in the wrecked area. Ambulances and automobiles were rushing storm victims to the Elyria Hospital.\" First Relief Train is Blocked. Nickel Plate trainmen reported that all the Government houses north of the railroad tracks in South Lorain had been blown down. Two men were killed there and thousands of dollars worth of property damaged. Property damage at Akron, Ohio, was estimated at more than $1,000,000. FCleveland companies of the Ohio National Guard were being assembled in anticipation of orders to proceed to Lorain after messengers brought word that troops were wanted to aid in the relief work and preserve order. About fifty members of the 112th Engineers Corps were rushed to Lorain in taxicabs upon receipt of Governor Donahey's orders. They were in charge of Colonel Ralph R. White. A Nickel Plate train is ready to take the rest of the troops as soon as they can be mobilized. The first relief train sent from here by the Nickel Plate Railroad reached East Lorain late tonight, but could not proceed to Lorain because of the bad condition of the tracks, the Nickel Plate dispatched announced. A second Nickel Plate train is due at Lorain at 11 P.M. The first relief train made no report of the conditions found at Lorain. A relief train was sent to the scene by the Nickel Plate Railroad, while all police emergency cars and other available automobiles left here with nurses and physicians. Rescuers Send Call for Help.\" The Elyria fire department, which succeeded in reaching Lorain, sent out a frantic appeal for help, reporting that several hundreds were injured when the theatre collapsed. A street in South Lorain also is reported to have been undermined. From Sandusky came reports that a car ferry blew over. Interurban service between here and Lorain, Sandusky, and intermediate points is at a standstill. The entire Elyria Fire and Police Departments and ambulance equipment have been sent to Lorain. The only way to reach Lorain from Cleveland is through Elyria, and roads are jammed with refugees headed away from Lorain and relief parties on the way there.\"[6] Marysville Journal-Tribune published the following article on May 14, 1925: TORNADO HELP COSTS MILLION Columbus, May 14. -- Financial report of the Ohio relief commission of the American Red cross.

The twenty-fifth namable storm of the season, Gamma first developed as a tropical depression on November\u00a014 just west of the Windward Islands from a tropical wave that left the west coast of Africa on November\u00a03. Although tropical storm-force winds did not impact the islands, the storm brought damagingly heavy rainfall to Trinidad and to St. Vincent and the Grenadines, including causing two deaths on Bequia due to a muslide. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gamma on November\u00a015 over the Caribbean Sea while moving away from the Windward Islands. However, unfavorable wind shear weakened the storm to a tropical depression later that day and caused it to degenerate into a tropical wave on November\u00a016 about halfway between Colombia and Jamaica. Continuing westward across the Caribbean, the remnants of Gamma interacted with a low-pressure area on November\u00a018. This likely aided the system into re-developing into Tropical Storm Gamma along the north coast of Honduras that day. After re-emerging into the Caribbean, the cyclone strengthened and peaked with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). Despite predictions of the storm striking Cuba and potentially Florida, Gamma instead drifted over the Gulf of Honduras and weakened due to a wind shear, dengerating into a remnant low on November\u00a021, which struck Honduras before dissipating the next day. Intense flooding and landslides occurred in Honduras, especially along the north coast. The storm destroyed about 2,000\u00a0homes and displaced thousands of people, including approximately 50,000\u00a0people who became isolated after dozens of bridges were swept away. Banana crops alone suffered $13\u201318\u00a0million in damage, while 34\u00a0fatalities occurred in the country.

        "content": "Tropical Storm Gamma originated out of a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on November 3. For a late-season tropical wave, the system kept an unusually high amount of convection as it trekked across the Atlantic Ocean.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to actively track the wave on November\u00a013, when it was located about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) off the coast of Barbados.[2] That day, a low-pressure area formed along the axis of the wave, with moderate easterly wind shear initially keeping convection displaced well to the east.[1] However, wind shear soon abated, making conditions conducive for tropical development.[3] Early on November\u00a014, radar imagery from Martinique indicated that convective banding formed near and just east of the low-level circulation.[4] Consequently, Tropical Depression Twenty-Seven developed at 00:00\u00a0UTC over the far eastern Caribbean Sea about 55\u00a0mi (90\u00a0km) west of Saint Vincent.[1] An upper-level trough near the Greater Antilles continued to provide westerly shear that briefly stalled the development,[4][5] but the system's strong convection persisted.[5][6] A break in the shear on November\u00a015 enabled the storm to briefly strengthen. Post-season analysis showed during this period the system reached tropical storm status and should have been christened Gamma, as ships well to the northwest reported near-tropical storm-force winds and Dvorak satellite intensity estimates reached T2.5, indicating sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). But as this was not seen at the time, the storm remained classified Tropical Depression Twenty-Seven.[1] A deep-layered subtropical high pressure ridge over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico propelled the system westward across the Caribbean at more than 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) and the storm's upper circulation was entirely separated from its deep convection and low level circulatory center.[1][7][8] The NHC, believing that the system was dissipating, announced that it was issuing its last advisory on November\u00a016.[9] Around 18:00\u00a0UTC, Gamma degenerated into a tropical wave about halfway between Colombia and Jamaica.[1] The deep-layered subtropical high pressure ridge initially caused the remnants of Gamma to continue generally westward at 23\u201325\u00a0mph (37\u201340\u00a0km/h), until the system slowed down while approaching Honduras on November\u00a017.[1] A low-pressure area, which had formed over Panama in early November and had produced rainfall in the region, merged into the waning remnants of Tropical Depression Twenty-Seven near Honduras on November 18.[10] Although the NHC described the interaction of these two systems as complex, the low likely aided the remnants of Gamma in redeveloping into a tropical storm around 18:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a018 along the north coast of Honduras about 15\u00a0mi (25\u00a0km) southwest of Lim\u00f3n.[1] The system's strengthening was slow,[11] owing to the presence of high wind shear.[12] It reached peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h)[1] before the shear exposed the center[13][14] and its weakening trend began.[15] Despite flares of convection,[15] Gamma weakened into a tropical depression on November 20[16] and further into a remnant low early on November 21.[1][17] The low quickly dissipated on November 22 near the Honduran-Nicaraguan border.[1]"

That afternoon the storm moved away from Belize the southernmost portion of the tropical storm warning was lifted, followed in totality a few hours later.[1] That night, Mexico also lifted its watching and warnings. It was not until the following day, November 20, that the warnings were lifted from the Bay Islands of Honduras.[1] Because the storm regenerated shortly before it was predicted to make landfall, few advanced preparations for the storm were taken in Honduras. However, constant rainfall for well over a day as Gamma wandered offshore caused floods that forced over 30,000 people to abandon their homes[19] for state-run shelters.[20]"

Overflowing rivers destroyed seven homes and make several roads impassable.[22] The island's airport was temporarily closed when the tropical depression flooded the terminal and left debris on the runway. Heavy rains caused flooding and landslides, which washed away two bridges on the island of Trinidad, outside the capital Port-of-Spain.[21] Although tropical storm-force winds did not impact mainland Honduras,[1] an unofficial report of 4.44 inches (113\u00a0mm) of rain was reported on Roatan Island,[1] and more than 30 inches (760\u00a0mm) of rain fell along the northern coast between November 16 and 19 before Gamma even reached the country.[23] The rainfall triggered flooding and landslides in the northern departments of Gracias a Dios, Col\u00f3n, Atl\u00e1ntida, Cort\u00e9s, Yoro, Santa B\u00e1rbara, and the Bay Islands which killed 34 people and left 13 missing .[19][23] These areas had already been affected by Hurricane Wilma and Hurricane Beta about a month earlier.[19] Dozens of bridges were washed away cutting off more than 50,000\u00a0people[24] and 2,000 homes were destroyed[19] 5,200 acres (21\u00a0km2) of banana crop was destroyed, totalling $13\u201318\u00a0million (2005\u00a0USD) in damage.[1] In Belize, Gamma contributed to the crash of a private plane, operating from an exclusive jungle resort. All three people aboard were killed as it passed through Gamma's outer bands.[24] Five fishermen from Sarteneja were lost at sea during the storm when a large wave capsized their boat.[25] The only country suffering lasting damage from the storm was Honduras.[26] After the storm turned out to sea and Gamma's rains desisted, Honduran helicopters began rescuing those stranded by flood waters.[26] The United Nations' World Food Programme spent $460,000 (2005\u00a0USD) airlifting 645\u00a0tonnes of food, enough for 195,000\u00a0five-person families, to northern Honduras.[27] The Red Cross also provided food aid, hygiene kits, blankets and other humanitarian aid to families that had sustained damage to their property or were displaced into shelters.[26] Both of these organizations already had active distribution networks in the country as they were responding to hurricanes Stan, Wilma, and Beta, all of which caused fatalities in Honduras that year.[27][28] The government of Andaluc\u00eda, in Spain, donated 40\u00a0million lempiras to aid in disaster efforts, and the United States employed helicopters from a nearby military base to assist Honduran ones in the distribution of food aid.[26][29] Relative to the hurricanes of previous weeks, the humanitarian needs following Gamma were minimal, and were simply blended into the ongoing efforts.[27]"

The fire was active in the Pike National Forest and adjoining areas, covering a total of 18,247 acres (29\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 74\u00a0km2).[2] The fire had caused the evacuation of over 32,000 residents of Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs and Woodland Park, several small mountain communities along the southwestern side of U.S. Highway 24, and partial evacuation of the United States Air Force Academy.[3][4] There were 346 homes destroyed by the fire.[5] U.S. Highway 24, a major east\u2013west road, was closed in both directions.[6]  The Waldo Canyon Fire resulted in insurance claims totaling more than US $453.7 million.[7] It was the most destructive fire in Colorado state history, as measured by the number of homes destroyed, until the Black Forest Fire surpassed it almost a year later when it consumed 486 homes and damaged 28 others.[8][9]"

It likely started in the afternoon of June 22, 2012 when a report of the smell of smoke in the area was received by local agencies. Firefighters from the Pike National Forest as well as local agencies responded immediately but were unable to locate the source in very steep terrain before nightfall. The ground search resumed in early morning the following day.  The initial smoke column was first spotted and caught on video by cyclists on the range, as the fire began to spread quickly, soon reaching one of the ridges.[10][11]:\u200a5\u200a Air support was requested at 12:24\u00a0p.m. by the Colorado Springs Fire Department.[12]  Helicopters began dropping water on the fire within hours.[10][11]:\u200a5\u200a Erratic winds caused the fire to spread rapidly in the northwest and south directions. By 3 p.m., the fire grew to 600 acres spreading towards the towns of Chipita Park, Green Mountain Falls, and Cascade, Colorado.[13]  It also spread towards the western and northwestern areas of the Colorado Springs area and Manitou Springs. Residents began to evacuate as the fire intensified.[13][14] Planes dropped retardant slurry on what they believed was the Pyramid Mountain Fire, which was a less than 20 acre fire in the same area the night before. As the fire intensified, flames seemed to reach 150 feet above the treetops.[15] Numerous fire resources, including multiple ground crews, helicopters, and seventy fire trucks were called in, a staging area for firefighters was established, and the CSFD mobile command unit was activated. The city's emergency operations center was opened. The city also asked fire departments from Stratmoor Hills, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, Cimarron Hills and Peterson Air Force Base to fill four city stations.  Three more were left empty. Ground crews, including Colorado Springs Utilities' Catamount Wildland Fire Team and multiple other agencies, began to cut a firebreak above Cedar Heights, an effort that would continue in the following days.[15] US Highway 24 was closed at 31st Street and through Ute Pass on June 24.[16]:\u200a8\u200a By that day, eleven thousand people had evacuated their homes and shelters were set up for evacuees in Colorado Springs[17] and Woodland Park.[16]:\u200a8\u200a The Norris-Penrose Equestrian Center provided shelter for evacuated horses including those from the Academy Riding Stables in Garden of the Gods, Flying W Ranch, Dreamcatchers Equine Rescue, and Rock Ledge Ranch.[18]"

        "header": "Intensification",
        "content": "The fire crossed Rampart Range Road on June 25 when a flaming deer leaped across the road. The fire spread quickly into Queens Canyon due to the dry terrain, hot conditions, and steep topography, which made it difficult for fire fighters to manage the fire. Around noon, two C-130 aircraft from the 302d Airlift Wing at nearby Peterson Air Force Base[19] and two from the 153d Airlift Wing in Wyoming were made available for their first air dump of retardant near the Queens Canyon area.[20] On June 26, 2012, Colorado Springs experienced a record high temperature of 101\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C), which aided the fire's rapid expansion through Queen's Canyon and creating significant smoke. The fire crested Queen's Canyon and winds from the west nearing 65\u00a0mph gusts (the cyclonic winds of the collapsing pyrocumulus cloud from the fire storm) pushed the fire down the slope and into the Mountain Shadows, Oak Valley Ranch, and Peregrine neighborhoods.[21] The fire moved about 2 miles per hour towards the city.[22] Embers were carried by the wind to a distance of up to a quarter mile away and caused multiple small spot fires of brush and low vegetation.[22]  Once the fire crossed into neighborhoods, the fuel for the fire was houses, and the fire spread house-to-house.[22] By late afternoon and evening, multiple structures were burned including the Flying W Ranch, a Colorado Springs landmark built in 1953. Within the time span of twelve hours, 346 homes in western Colorado Springs had burned to the ground, and hundreds more were reported as damaged by fire and smoke.[21][23][a] The fire, though, generally went out where fire-mitigation efforts had been implemented, such as homes in the Cedar Heights area. In 2001, fire mitigation efforts were implemented by the city's fire department and area residents for houses with the highest risk of fire damage.[22] By June 27, businesses\u2014such as call centers, data centers, and data research centers[22]\u2014and 30,000 or more people had been evacuated. The Colorado Veterinary Medical Reserve Corps tended to animals that were affected by the evacuated, subject to smoke-related symptoms, or anxiety due to the natural flight reflex to get away from the smoke.[25] A firefighter with the Denver Fire Department and a US Geological Survey (USGS) aerial survey team estimated by photographic topography that 300 or more homes had burned to the ground on June 27.[26] The fire threatened to spread to Crystola and parts of Woodland Park in Teller County.[27] The specialized Vandenberg Air Force Base Hot Shots team arrived in Colorado Springs[28] and helped limit what could have been significant eastward movement of the fire. Fire fighters were affected by fatigue and injuries. One Company Officer expressed \"safety concerns\" after he worked a 36-hour shift.  Six firefighters suffered minor injuries, and 52 firefighters were sent home due to fatigue.[15] At the height of the fire, 1,500 firefighters stayed at the Holmes Middle School campus. Some days, more than 300 grateful people lined up to welcome them back after their shifts.[29] The Pikes Peak Community Foundation created The Waldo Canyon Fire Fighter's Fund on June 28 to support the efforts of public and volunteer fire departments in El Paso and Teller Counties. This fund provided financial resources for the fire departments for food, cots, firefighting equipment, or future wildfire mitigation efforts in the Pikes Peak region.[30] During a two-and-a-half hour visit on June 29, President Barack Obama toured the Mountain Shadows neighborhood, thanked Fire Station 9 firefighters, and visited the American Red Cross evacuation shelter at Southeast YMCA Family Center.[31] Memorial Health System (MHS) emergency room physicians and nurses treated adults and children with breathing problems from the heavy smoke in the area. University of Colorado Health (UCHealth) and Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora offered donations, supplies and medical staff to assist in treating patients. Volunteers also assisted in the City of Colorado Springs\u2019 emergency command center.[32] William Everett, a 74-year-old Vietnam veteran, and his wife, 73-year-old Barbara, died from \"thermal injuries and smoke inhalation\" as they were in the process of evacuating their house when the home caught fire.[15] On Sunday, July 1, firefighters were able to contain 55 percent of the fire, but the city still remained under a red flag warning throughout the day.[33] Most of the 35,000 people displaced by the Waldo Canyon fire were allowed to return to their homes, despite continued risk of fire damage to their homes, theft of their homes' contents, or bears. About 3,000 residents remained under evacuation orders.[34] Mandatory evacuations in some areas of Northwestern Colorado Springs were expected to be lifted by evening.[35] More than $85,000 was raised at the televised \"A Community Rises\" benefit concert was held July 4 at the Colorado Springs World Arena from attendees, the World Arena, and Colorado Springs Philharmonic. Online donations through Pikes Peak United Way increased the total to $288,807.00. Other grants, including $125,000 from El Pomar Foundation, brought the final number to well over $500,000. The benefit was organized by the Philharmonic, World Arena, Colorado Springs Independent, Focus on the Family, Pikes Peak United Way and other media.[36]"

The team said that the landscape looked like that of the moon.[41] The team was concerned that increased flooding in the area of the fire scar could lead to mudslides along roads and into neighborhoods. \"What ends up happening is big boulders, trees, all these burnt trees can fall over, get in these drainages, move downhill very quickly and then cause debris dams and then cause roads to fail and perhaps failures onto Highway 24 or into neighborhoods... this will continue to impact this area absolutely for at least 10 years. Those who live near the burn area need to stay alert and be prepared.\"[42] El Paso County published a \"Relief and Recovery Assistance Guide\" to connect residents with disaster assistance and information.[43]"

To mitigate possible damage, the Forest Service cleaned culverts, removed sediment, installed warning signs and more, at a cost of about $5 million. Colorado Springs Utilities spent about $8.2 million to fix a damaged pipeline and access road near West Monument Creek, add sediment catchment basins at Flying W Ranch and at Glen Eyrie, and planned to construct a debris fence, temporary floodwall and auxiliary spillway at the Alpine Autism Center. About $6 million in projects for the city include build sediment ponds built by Air Force Academy cadets and volunteers along the slopes of Blodgett Peak Open Space.[45] Aerial mulching for emergency stabilization via helicopters treated 3,038 acres with AgStraw and over 8,000 tons of Woodshred mulch by September.[46]  CDOT and El Paso County have focused on the Highway 24 area, working to secure slopes along the route and improve drainage. CDOT's long-term improvements, which began in 2013, included a concrete retaining wall to manage debris flow and replacing 18-inch drainage pipes with pipes at least twice as large. The county plans to add a basin to catch sediment and debris upstream of Rainbow Falls, with work beginning late 2013. Manitou Springs doubled the size of two storm drains to handle the flow from Williams Canyon Creek, purchased three early-warning sirens, and removed trees from Fountain Creek that were catching debris.[45]"

Some 185 new home permits had been issued and 63 of those were completed.[51] As people returned to their homes and began rebuilding, some found that copper hardware or other items had been stolen from their homes.[52][c] In June 2014, almost 250 houses had been built to replace the 347 houses that had been destroyed by the fire. In the Mountain Shadows neighborhood, 77% of the houses were rebuilt, on average 13.8% larger than their original homes. Many of the residents have implemented fire mitigation plans, although building larger homes makes more fuel for fires. Those that didn't rebuild have put up their lots for sale.[53] Over 450 houses that survived the actual fire demonstrated in the following months hidden damage due to exposure to high temperatures (up to 2,000 degrees F), ash or embers, and corrosive particulate infiltration.[54] Disgruntled about the fire and unable to get insurance company to pay their claims, nearly 50 families from the Mountain Shadows, Peregrine and Rockrimmon neighborhoods formed the  Waldo Canyon Fire Victims Association, the later group was renamed the Catastrophic Insurance Complaints in Colorado Association. They met with elected officials, including Mayor Steve Bach in early January, 2013 to reduce the bureaucratic processes. Some of the homeowners said they wouldn't get full payment from their insurance companies until they have rebuilt their homes or replaced damaged property, which they must do by June 26, 2013, one year after the fire.[55] The Waldo Canyon Fire Assistance Fund of $940,299.93 was given to twenty local non-profit groups by January 2013. The funds were given out in the form of grants approved by an advisory committee made up of people with emergency response experience and a victim of the fire. The fund was established with a seed grant of $125,000 from El Pomar Foundation and donations from the community.[56] The Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum staff recognized the historical significance of the fire and asked for residents to tell their stories and collected artifacts from the fire.[57]  The  exhibit called From the Ashes: The Waldo Canyon Fire debuted on June 22, 2013.[58] Officials from all the impacted districts said returning to a consistent and predictable schedule and school activities would help staff and students alike find normalcy and move on.[59][d] Businesses that rely on tourism were affected by the 2012 fire, losing up to 50% of their revenue for that year. Low interest loans through the Colorado Enterprise Fund were offered to small businesses who lost business due to the fire. Businesses could receive loans up to $10,000 with a zero percent interest rate for twelve months and then 12 percent interest after that. There were also opportunities for support for organizations that were members of the Colorado Springs Business Alliance.[60]"

Closed areas include areas south of the reservoir; Waldo Canyon, Williams Canyon and Blodgett Peak trails, the trail to Nichols Reservoir, and other trails that enter steeper, more severely burned areas.[61][62] The United States Forest Service and Colorado Parks and Wildlife reported in February 2015 that there does not seem to be a lasting negative effect of wildlife in the area of the Waldo Canyon fire. Big horn sheep appear to have gotten out of the way of the fire to not have a loss in life and are thriving in the bigger open spaces left by the fire.

It found that there were times when firefighters were unclear of what they should be doing and unable to reach someone via command; that there was poor planning, notification, and staffing for the northwest Colorado Springs neighborhoods evacuation and firefighting resources; and that the city's damage would have been much more significant without the firefighting equipment and crews.[15] On February 7, 2013, the city of Woodland Park issued its own After Action Report, with an analysis of the city's strengths and recommendations. There were three top logistical recommendations, including mapping during evacuation notification phases, and evacuation validation marking system, and provisions to increase staffing at the City Hall to manage incoming calls.[16] A two-year study of the Waldo Canyon Fire burn site began February 2013 with engineers and scientists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the request of U.S. Senators Michael Bennett and Mark Udall. The NIST is being aided by input from the U.S. Forest Service, Colorado Springs firefighters, and use of the city's existing three-dimensional imaging of the Mountain Shadows area. Colorado Springs was partially chosen for the city's programs and building codes to manage fire risk.[64] On March 27, the Fire Adapted Communities Coalition released a 48-page report about the success of the areas that had been a part of a ten-year ongoing fire mitigation program.[22][e] On April 3, 2012, the City of Colorado Springs released its 111-page Final After Action Report to evaluate the effectiveness of the response to the fire and determine any actionable items for the future.[11]:\u200a1,\u200a5\u200a Recommendations included training and improvement in real-time documentation, logistics, incident management, and internal and partner agency communications.[11]:\u200a7\u200a On April 19, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office released its 26-page After Action Report.[12][f] The state Forest Service and Colorado State University completed a study in 2013 that found that about 20% of Colorado's population and 25% of Colorado homes are in a \"red zone\", or a place with high likelihood of fires. El Paso County is one of the top three counties for fire danger with 45% of its residents within a red zone.[g] Colorado has seen a 300 percent increase in wildfires between 2003 and 2013.[69]"

It formed during the peak of the busy 1959 Pacific typhoon season near Guam, and moved generally to the west-northwest. Continued observations from the hurricane hunters allowed the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to track Sarah from its origins to its peak as a powerful typhoon, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 305\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph) on September\u00a015. Shortly thereafter, the typhoon struck the small Japanese island of Miyako-jima, where the barometric pressure fell to 908.1\u00a0mbar (26.82\u00a0inHg), the second-lowest on record for the country. Sarah turned to the north and northeast, weakening from its peak intensity. On September\u00a017, the typhoon made landfall just west of Busan, South Korea with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), the nation's strongest landfall at the time and only to be surpassed by Typhoon Maemi in 2003. Sarah later became extratropical over the Japanese island of Hokkaido on September\u00a018, although the remnants persisted for several days, crossing into the Russian Far East and later dissipating on September\u00a023. On Miyako-jima, Sarah damaged all of the crops and destroyed about 6,000\u00a0houses. Damage was estimated at $2\u00a0million,[nb 1] and there were seven deaths. The damage prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency to give Sarah the special name of the \"Miyakojima Typhoon\". However, the effects were worst in South Korea, and Sarah was described as the worst typhoon there in 50\u00a0years. Wind gusts there peaked at 169\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), the highest at the time in the country. High winds and waves heavily damaged the port of Busan. Nationwide, the storm destroyed over 14,000\u00a0homes and left 782,126\u00a0people homeless, causing over $100\u00a0million in damage. At least 669\u00a0people were killed in South Korea, and an additional 1,200\u00a0fishermen were lost offshore the country.

        "content": "On September\u00a010, a tropical disturbance persisted within the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Pohnpei. When the hurricane hunters approached the system at 02:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011, they observed a center with several small circulations about 130\u00a0km (81\u00a0mi) east of Guam. On that basis, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center[nb 2] classified the system as Tropical Depression Sarah. The depression passed near or just north of Guam, as tracked by radar. By late on September\u00a011, the hurricane hunters were reporting flight-level winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). Early on September\u00a012, the JTWC upgraded Sarah to a tropical storm after the circulation became better defined. The storm exhibited a parabolic trajectory that was slightly to the west of the typical September storm. It moved westward initially but gradually curved to the northwest. A hurricane hunters flight at 14:15\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012 observed a 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) eye diameter, prompting the JTWC to upgrade Sarah further to typhoon status, with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[1][nb 3] After becoming a typhoon, Sarah quickly intensified; at 08:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, the hurricane hunters reported flight-level winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[1] Subsequent analysis estimated that the typhoon attained these winds at 00:00\u00a0UTC that day. At 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014, the JTWC estimated that Sarah intensified to the equivalent of a Category\u00a05 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale,[2] based on aircraft estimates. The typhoon intensified further, and late on September\u00a014 the hurricane hunters reported flight-level winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), estimating surface winds of 315\u00a0km/h (195\u00a0mph).[1] The intensity was adjusted slightly downward in a post-analysis, with peak winds of 305\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph) at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015 about 415\u00a0km (258\u00a0mi) east of Taiwan. In addition, the typhoon attained a minimum barometric pressure of 905\u00a0mbar (26.7\u00a0inHg).[2] About three hours after Sarah reached peak winds, the typhoon moved directly over Miyako-jima, an island of Japan east of Taiwan. Sarah weakened while curving to the north, and it passed west of Okinawa late on September\u00a015.[1] The winds dropped quickly; by 24\u00a0hours after peak intensity, Sarah's winds had decreased from 305 to 185\u00a0km/h (190 to 115\u00a0mph). The typhoon turned and accelerated to the northeast toward the Korean peninsula, re-intensifying slightly. By late on September\u00a016, the winds increased to 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) while Sarah passed just east of Jeju island. The typhoon weakened again to winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a017.[1] That day, Sarah made landfall a few miles west of Busan, South Korea at that intensity;[1][3] this made Sarah the strongest typhoon to strike the country since records began in 1904, and it remained as such until Typhoon Maemi surpassed it in 2003.[3] The typhoon very quickly emerged into the Sea of Japan, its circulation becoming poorly defined. On September\u00a018, Sarah became extratropical after moving over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.[1] The remnants continued to the northeast initially before turning sharply westward, passing over Sakhalin. The circulation progressed into Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East before turning back east. Former Typhoon Sarah struck Sakhalin a second time on September\u00a020 while moving east-southeastward. After passing through the Kuril Islands, the remnants of Sarah dissipated on September\u00a023.[2]"

        "content": "Early in its duration, Sarah brought gusty winds and passing showers to Guam.[1] Shortly after reaching peak intensity, Sarah passed near the island of Miyako-jima.[1] The pressure there fell to 908.1\u00a0mbar (26.82\u00a0inHg), which was the lowest recorded for the station and the second-lowest on record for Japan, both as of 2003.[7] The typhoon produced sustained winds of 196\u00a0km/h (122\u00a0mph) and gusts up to 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) before the anemometer broke. The winds destroyed over 6,000\u00a0homes and wrecked all of the crops. Sarah also left the island without power for an extended period of time after damaging power lines. The combination of high winds and rough seas destroyed a fishing pier and 670\u00a0m (2,200\u00a0ft) of seawall,[1] as well as several tidal weirs.[8] Sarah also sank four fishing boats and damaged seven others.[9] On Miyako-jima, Sarah killed seven people, injured 88\u00a0others, and left $2\u00a0million in damage.[1] The heavy damage on the island prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency to give Sarah the special name of the \"Miyakojima Typhoon\".[10] Sarah was part of a series of typhoons striking the island in 1959, causing food shortages that forced the population to change their diet.[11] The storm brushed Okinawa with gusts of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[1] Sarah was the worst typhoon to strike the Korean peninsula in 50\u00a0years.[1] The peak wind gust in South Korea was 169\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), which was the highest for a typhoon at the time, with records dating back to 1904; as of 2010, the value has fallen to the ninth place.[12] Damage was heaviest at Busan where the storm struck. The port there sustained over $100,000 in damage, and nearby American military bases had over $900,000 in damage. Coastal floods washed away or damaged 15,379\u00a0homes in the Busan area, leaving 25,834\u00a0people homeless. The waves also damaged or sank 5,400\u00a0boats. Nationwide, floods damaged 127,000\u00a0hectares (313,000\u00a0acres) of crop fields. Throughout South Korea, Sarah destroyed over 14,000\u00a0homes and left 782,126\u00a0people homeless, thousands of whom were injured. The Ministry of Social Affairs estimated property damage at over $100\u00a0million, and the typhoon killed at least 669\u00a0people.[1] After the storm, the CARE relief agency launched an appeal in the United States, collecting $18,500 worth of shoes and underwear for storm victims.[13] The Australian Red Cross also provided assistance to the country, including money, sheets, and blankets.[14] Due to the ongoing Korean War and Sarah, South Korea lost much of its fishing fleet, resulting in diminished catches over the subsequent decades.[15] The typhoon also caused a rise in the wholesale price index, in conjunction with political uncertainty.[16] A fleet of 46\u00a0boats left Oenarodo near Busan on August\u00a028 to fish near Komundo Island. The fleet failed to return after the passage of Typhoon Sarah, and local newspapers reported all 1,200\u00a0fishermen were lost.[17] Late in its duration, Sarah struck Hokkaido,[1] producing a 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) storm surge at Taisei along the southwest coast that left behind a sediment layer 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) inland.[18] Before the storm arrived, the United States evacuated planes from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni to Misawa Air Base, although Sarah approached closer to the latter base.[19] The storm affected much of the nation, flooding many communities,[1] including 14,360\u00a0houses. Across the country, the typhoon damaged 778\u00a0boats. The storm also damaged 3,566\u00a0ha (8,810 acres) of crop fields. Nationwide, Sarah destroyed 16,632\u00a0homes, injured 509\u00a0people, and killed 47.[20] Overall, Typhoon Sarah caused around 2,000\u00a0deaths, making it among the deadliest typhoons on record.[21]"

The outbreak began in the Great Plains, where, over a two-day period, several tornadoes touched down, some of which were significant. The North Platte area was damaged by an EF3 that was produced by a supercell that spawned many tornadoes throughout its lifespan. The tornadic activity then shifted the Southern United States over subsequent days, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi.[2] These states were struck by a series of tornadoes for 3 days, most of which were relatively weak on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. However, a few reached EF2 intensity and caused considerable damage. Tornado activity continued across the Ohio Valley on the 23rd, with one confirmed fatality in southern Illinois."

Early that night, a tornado-producing supercell moved across southwestern Nebraska, where four tornadoes were confirmed. The first was an EF3, the second was an EF1, the third was an EF3, and the fourth was an EF2. Severe damage was noted just to the west of the city of North Platte, Nebraska. The following day, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Moderate risk of Severe Weather, encompassing much of central and eastern Texas, into southeastern Oklahoma and extreme western Arkansas.

        "content": " The Columbus Day storm of 1962 (also known as the big blow of 1962,[2] and originally in Canada as Typhoon Freda) was a Pacific Northwest windstorm that struck the West Coast of Canada and the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States on October 12, 1962. Typhoon Freda was the twenty-eighth tropical depression, the twenty-third tropical storm, and the eighteenth typhoon of the 1962 Pacific typhoon season. Freda originated from a tropical disturbance over the Northwest Pacific on September 28. On October 3, the system strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name Freda, before becoming a typhoon later that day, while moving northeastward. The storm quickly intensified, reaching its peak as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon on October 5, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 948 millibars (28.0\u00a0inHg). Freda maintained its intensity for another day, before beginning to gradually weaken, later on October 6. On October 9, Freda weakened into a tropical storm, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on the next day. On October 11, Freda turned eastward and accelerated across the North Pacific, before striking the Pacific Northwest on the next day. On October 13, the cyclone made landfall on Washington and Vancouver Island, and then curved northwestward. Afterward, the system moved into Canada and weakened, before being absorbed by another developing storm to the south on October 17. The Columbus Day storm of 1962 is considered to be the benchmark of extratropical wind storms. The storm ranks among the most intense to strike the region since at least 1948, likely since the January 9, 1880 \"Great Gale\" and snowstorm. The storm is a contender for the title of the most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 \"storm of the century\" and the \"1991 Halloween Nor'easter\" (\"the perfect storm\").  The system brought strong winds to the Pacific Northwest and southwest Canada, and was linked to 46\u00a0fatalities in the northwest and Northern California resulting from heavy rains and mudslides."

        "content": "On the morning of September 28, a tropical disturbance formed south of Eniwetok Atoll. After moving westward and making a large bend around the island, the new system slowly gained strength, and on the morning of October 3, the system became a tropical storm about 500 miles (800\u00a0km) from Wake Island, over the central Pacific Ocean.[3] Now named Freda, the system rapidly intensified as it proceeded northeastward over the open Pacific waters. On that afternoon, Freda intensified into a typhoon, with 1-minute sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). On October 4, the typhoon quickly intensified, reaching its peak of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) on the next day, with a minimum central pressure of 948 millibars (27.99\u00a0inHg), making the storm the equivalent of a Category 3 typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. After stabilizing to the north, Freda maintained its strength through the Pacific, before beginning to weaken slowly on October 6. Making a turn to the northeast, Freda maintained typhoon-status winds for several more days, before weakening into a tropical storm on October 9, as it started experiencing the effects of cold air.[4] Moving northeastward at a steady rate of 16\u00a0mph (26\u00a0km/h), the storm slowly underwent an extratropical transition, becoming extratropical operationally on the morning of October 10, still with winds of 45\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h).[4] The system became an extratropical cyclone as it moved into colder waters and interacted with the jet stream. However, post-season analysis concluded that the system continued weakening as it continued northeastward, crossing the 180th meridian later that afternoon, before completing the transition that evening.[5] The extratropical low redeveloped intensely off the coast of Northern California, due to favorable upper-level conditions, producing record rainfall across the San Francisco Bay Area that delayed some games in the 1962 World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the New York Yankees. The low moved northeastward, and then hooked straight north, as it neared southwest Oregon. The storm then raced nearly northward at an average speed of 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h), with the center situated just 50 miles (80\u00a0km) off the Pacific Coast. There was little central pressure change until the cyclone passed the latitude of Astoria, Oregon, at which time the low began to degrade. On October 13, the center passed over Tatoosh Island, Washington, before making landfall on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where it weakened rapidly. The cyclone then curved northwestward, before turning back eastward and moving into Canada. As the cyclone moved through Canada, another cyclone formed on its southern periphery, which absorbed the original cyclone by October 17.[6] The extratropical cyclone deepened to a minimum central pressure of at least 960\u00a0hPa (28\u00a0inHg), and perhaps as low as 958\u00a0hPa (28.3\u00a0inHg), a pressure which would be equivalent to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS). Since the system was an extratropical cyclone, its wind field was neither as compact nor as strong as a tropical cyclone, though its wind field was significantly larger. All-time record-low land-based pressures (up to 1962) included 969.2\u00a0hPa (28.62\u00a0inHg) at Astoria, 970.5\u00a0hPa (28.66\u00a0inHg) at Hoquiam, Washington, and 971.9\u00a0hPa (28.70\u00a0inHg) at North Bend, Oregon. The Astoria and Hoquiam records were broken by a major storm on December 12, 1995 (which measured 966.1\u00a0hPa (28.53\u00a0inHg) at Astoria); however, this event did not generate winds as intense as the Columbus Day Storm of 1962."

At Cape Blanco on the southern Oregon coast, an anemometer that lost one of its cups registered wind gusts in excess of 145 miles per hour (233 kilometers per hour); some reports put the peak velocity at 179\u00a0mph (288\u00a0km/h).  The north Oregon coast Mt. Hebo radar station reported winds of 170\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h).[8] At the Naselle Radar Station in the Willapa Hills of southwest Washington, a wind gust of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) was observed.[7] In Salem, Oregon, a wind gust of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) was observed.[7] At Corvallis, Oregon, an inland location in the Willamette Valley, one-minute average winds reached 69 miles per hour (111\u00a0km/h), with a gust to 127\u00a0mph (204\u00a0km/h), before the station was abandoned due to \"power failure and instruments demolished\". Observations at the weather station resumed the next day.[7] About 80 miles (130\u00a0km) to the north, at Portland, Oregon's major metropolitan area, measured wind gusts reached 116\u00a0mph (187\u00a0km/h) at the Morrison Street Bridge in downtown Portland. In Vancouver, Washington around 9 miles north of downtown Portland, a peak gust of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h) was observed at Pearson Field. Many anemometers, official and unofficial, within the heavily stricken area of northwestern Oregon and southwest Washington were damaged or destroyed before winds attained maximum velocity. For example, the wind gauge atop the downtown Portland studios of KGW radio and TV recorded two gusts of 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h), just before flying debris knocked the gauge off-line[9] shortly after 5 p.m. For the Willamette Valley, the lowest peak gust officially measured was 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h) at Eugene. This value, however, is higher than the maximum peak gust generated by any other Willamette Valley windstorm in the 1948\u20132010 period. In the interior of western Washington, officially measured wind gusts included 78 miles per hour (126\u00a0km/h) at Olympia, 88\u00a0mph (142\u00a0km/h) at McChord Air Force Base, 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) at Renton at 64 feet (20\u00a0m) and 98\u00a0mph (158\u00a0km/h) at Bellingham. In the city of Seattle, a peak wind speed of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) was recorded; this suggests gusts of at least 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Damaging winds reached as far inland as Spokane. Wind gusts of 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h), the National Weather Service minimum for \"High Wind Criteria,\" or higher were reported from San Francisco, to Vancouver, British Columbia."

        "content": "At least 46 fatalities were attributed to this storm, more than for any other Pacific Northwest weather event.[10] Injuries went into the hundreds. In terms of natural disaster-related fatalities for the 20th century, only Oregon's Heppner Flood of 1903 (247 deaths), Washington's Wellington avalanche of 1910 (96 deaths), the Great Fire of 1910 (87 deaths), and Eruption of Mount St. Helens of 1980 (57 deaths) caused more. For Pacific Northwest windstorms in the 20th century, the runner up was the infamous October 21, 1934, gale, which caused 22 fatalities, mostly in Washington. In less than 12\u00a0hours, more than 11 billion board feet (26,000,000 m3) of timber was blown down in northern California, Oregon and Washington combined; some estimates put it at 15 billion board feet (35,000,000 m3). This exceeded the annual timber harvest for Oregon and Washington at the time. This value is above any blowdown measured for East Coast storms, including hurricanes; even the often-cited 1938 New England hurricane, which toppled 2.65 billion board feet (6,300,000 m3), falls short by nearly an order of magnitude. Estimates put the dollar damage at approximately $230\u00a0million to $280\u00a0million for California, Oregon, and Washington combined. Those figures in 1962 US dollars translate to $1.8 to $2.2 billion in 2014 US dollars. Oregon's share exceeded $200\u00a0million in 1962 US dollars. This is comparable to land-falling hurricanes that occurred within the same time frame (for example, Audrey, Donna, and Carla from 1957 to 1961).[11] The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.

At the north end of the Valley, two 500-foot (150\u00a0m) high voltage transmission towers were toppled. Radio and TV broadcasting were affected in the Portland area. KGW-TV lost its tower at Skyline and replaced the temporary tower with a new one on January 28, 1963. KOIN radio lost one of two AM towers at Sylvan. KPOJ-AM/-FM lost much of its transmitting equipment, plus one of two towers was left partially standing at Mount Scott. KPOJ-FM was so badly damaged it wouldn't return to the air until February 9, 1963. KWJJ-AM lost one of its towers and a portion of its transmitter building at Smith Lake. KISN-AM also lost a tower at Smith Lake. Seven-month-old TV station KATU did not receive any damage at its Livingston Mountain site, 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) north of Camas, Washington. However, KATU didn't have a generator and power was cut off. The heavy-duty design of the radio towers on Portland's West Hills today, with extensive and robust guy cables, is a direct result of the lessons learned from the 1962 catastrophe. For northwest Oregon, the entire power distribution system had to be rebuilt from the ground up. Some locations did not have power restored for several weeks.[10] This storm became a lasting memory for local power distributors.  Indeed, a number of high wind related studies appeared in the years after the storm in an attempt to assess the return frequency of such potentially damaging winds. The state capitol grounds at Salem, and the state's college campuses, resembled battlefields with heavy losses of trees. The Campbell Hall tower at Oregon College of Education (now Western Oregon University) in Monmouth crashed to the ground,[14] an event recorded by student photographer Wes Luchau in the most prominent picture-symbol of the storm. East of Salem, the wind destroyed a historic barn that served as a clandestine meeting place by pro-slavery Democratic members of the state Legislature in 1860.[citation needed] The Oregon State Beavers\u2013Washington Huskies college football game went on as scheduled Saturday, October 13 in Portland, in a heavily damaged Multnomah Stadium. Much of the roof was damaged and seats damaged by falling debris were replaced by portable chairs.[15] Crews cleared debris from the grandstand and playing field right up to kickoff.[15] Most of the electricity, including the scoreboard and clock, was still out and players dressed by candlelight in the locker rooms.[16] The Huskies came from behind to beat the Beavers 14\u201313, despite a strong performance by quarterback Terry Baker, who would win the Heisman Trophy later that year.[16][17]"

Laura's remnants later impacted the Netherlands, Germany, and Norway. The 12th named storm of the season, Laura formed out of a large extratropical area of low pressure located about 1,015 miles (1,633\u00a0km) west of the Azores on September\u00a029. Laura slowly developed tropical characteristics throughout the day as it moved over warmer waters. On the afternoon of September\u00a030, Laura had acquired enough tropical characteristics to be designated a tropical storm. Shortly after being declared tropical, Laura began to undergo an extratropical transition, which did not fully take place until the morning of October\u00a01. Laura degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone later that morning, and the final advisory by the National Hurricane Center was issued. The remnants of Laura contributed to heavy rainfall and power outages in the British Isles, the Netherlands, and Norway on October\u00a05 to 8."

        "content": "On September\u00a026, a very large extratropical area of low pressure developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred miles west of the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a027. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction.[1] By September\u00a029, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura.[2] Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying.[3] A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.[4] During the afternoon, satellites revealed that Laura had developed a deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature.[5] By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still under the influence of an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow.[6] However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura was on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September\u00a030, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical.[7] Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude,[8] 40.6\u00b0N.[1] Laura peaked as a tropical cyclone, attaining maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 994 millibars (29.4\u00a0inHg).[1] Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.[9] Overnight, convection associated with Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics, but still retained its status.[10] Early on October\u00a01, the extratropical transition was fully apparent. Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal and there was little convection around the center of the system.[11] With minimal shower and thunderstorm activity remaining around the center of Laura, the storm degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area on October\u00a01 while still producing tropical storm-force winds. The next day, the remnant system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and began to re-intensify as it rapidly tracked towards the north. Early on October\u00a03, the system slowed down as it turned towards the east and strengthened into a hurricane-force cyclone, with winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 990 millibars (29\u00a0inHg), reaching its extratropical peak. After accelerating towards the east, another large extratropical cyclone absorbed the remnants of Laura while located several hundred miles west of the British Isles on October\u00a04.[1]"

        "content": "As a tropical cyclone, Laura never approached land, and no damages or fatalities occurred. Since the storm remained over open waters for most of its life, several ships and oil platforms recorded tropical storm-force winds. The highest recorded winds were at an oil platform with the call sign VEP717 at 03:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01. Winds were recorded up to 47 knots (54\u00a0mph; 87\u00a0km/h).[1] Despite the lack of impact, the storm's remnants were caught in an upper-level jet stream, and steered towards Europe.[22] There, they contributed to heavy rainfall across portions of Britain on October\u00a05, causing localized accumulation of flood waters. As a result, Glebe Road near Windermere, England was closed in both directions, and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale, previously saturated soil, combined with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding. Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed due to poor driving conditions.[23] One person had to be rescued from her car after driving into a flooded street. The UK Environment Agency issued 76 flood watches and 21 severe flood warnings as a result of the rainfall.[24] On October\u00a08, the remnants of Laura reached the Netherlands. At the time, its rain bands began interacting with a cold front associated with a well-developed low west of Norway,[25] dropping up to 113\u00a0mm (4.4\u00a0in)[26] of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands. Consequently, streets and homes in the village of Hippolytushoef were reportedly inundated. The large amounts of precipitation broke the daily and monthly rainfall records for October, which were previously set in 2006.[27] Gradually passing through Norway, the remnants of the storm caused significant damage to electric utilities. As a result, more than 10,000 people lost power in southern parts of the country.[28]"

The steel base structure is covered with 1292 wooden planks.[4] The bridge was built in six months between June and November 1929 at a cost of $350,000[4] (equivalent to $4.9 million in 2023 dollars). In 1931, the Incline Railway, or simply the Incline (also known as a funicular), was added beside the bridge to reach the bottom of the gorge.[7] In the 1950s, a miniature railroad was built by the edge of the gorge and an aerial tram was opened in 1969.[7] In the early 1980s, the bridge was renovated with new cable anchors, suspension rods and paint.[4] A Skycoaster attraction was added in 2003, with riders being swung out over the edge of the gorge.[11] In June 2013, a wildfire destroyed most of the park's buildings and the aerial tram, and damaged the Incline. The bridge sustained only slight damage to the wooden deck and was otherwise undamaged, along with the Skycoaster.[9] The park was rebuilt and partially reopened in August 2014.[12] The park had a grand reopening in May 2015 with new gondolas and a new zip-line crossing the gorge on the east side of the bridge.[13][14]"

Piper, president of the Royal Gorge Bridge and Amusement Company of San Antonio, Texas. Piper hired George E. Cole as the Chief Engineer and the bridge was completed in about six months with no deaths or serious injuries.[4] The formal opening occurred on December 8, 1929. Piper agreed to a twenty-year lease of the gorge and surrounding land, which is owned by Ca\u00f1on City, paying a $1,000 yearly fee (equivalent to $14,000 in 2023 dollars) to the city, with a reduced fee of $500 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023 dollars) in some years of hardship.[7] In 1931, the 3\u00a0ft (914\u00a0mm) narrow gauge incline railway was built to the bottom of the gorge through a narrow cleft just west of the north end of the bridge.[7][19] The first suicide occurred later the same year when a man from Pueblo, Colorado jumped off the bridge.[7] In 1937, a lighting system was installed to illuminate the bridge and the gorge walls.[7] In 1947, after struggling for many years through the Great Depression and World War II, Piper sold the bridge and leasing rights to a group of local Colorado businessmen and Clint Murchison, a Texan who made a fortune in oil, gas, and real estate. A long-time employee of the park stated that Murchison, who died in 1969, never visited the bridge he had bought, even after he became the sole owner.[7] In the 1950s, a lodge was built by the gorge and the Silver Rock Railway 2\u00a0ft (610\u00a0mm) narrow gauge train with a Chance Rides miniature C.P. Huntington locomotive began running along the edge of the gorge near the bridge.[7] In 1956, Murchison and his Royal Gorge Bridge Company based in Dallas agreed to pay the city a percentage of its revenue instead of the $1,000 yearly fee for the lease. The percentage arrangement has proven very favorable for the city in the ensuing years, allowing it to lower property taxes significantly. The property tax rate has since become the lowest in Colorado.[7]"

The bid was won by Murchison's company, which signed another twenty-year contract with the city.[7] The aerial tram was opened in 1969, crossing the gorge just east of the bridge. Also in 1969, following the death of Murchison, his sons, John and Clint Jr., inherited the bridge and lease.[7] In 1979, Lucille Murchison, the wife of John Murchison, inherited the bridge and lease after her husband's death.[7] The bridge and the incline railway were listed in the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1983. The official government registration papers indicate that the city of Ca\u00f1on City had become the owner of the bridge and incline railway at some point since the 1940s, besides owning the land they leased to the Royal Gorge Bridge Company.[3] The bridge underwent significant renovations from 1980 to 1984. New cable anchors and suspension rods were installed and the bridge was re-painted. The cost of the renovations was over $2.8 million, more than the original purchase price when adjusted for inflation up until the 1980s.[4] In 1984, Leisure and Recreational Concepts, a Dallas-based company, was hired by Murchison to oversee operations at Royal Gorge Bridge and Park.[7] In July 1998, William Fehr, the owner of a gravel business based in Parkdale at the entrance to the gorge, purchased the rail lines through the gorge. The sale came after the Southern Pacific and the Union Pacific had merged in 1996 and decided to run their trains on better tracks through northern Colorado. As a part of the purchase, and unbeknownst to Fehr at the time, the sale included the \"air rights\" above the tracks through the gorge, including the space occupied by the Royal Gorge Bridge. An air rights fee had been negotiated with the railroad companies for $200 per year since 1929, plus another $200 per year for the space occupied by the base of the incline railway. In January 1999, Fehr placed a bid to purchase the entire concession from the city, since the operating company's lease was due to expire in 2001. When the bid was declined without consideration, Fehr decided to increase the fee for the air rights to $750,000 a year. The city began investigating legal procedures to possibly condemn the air rights.[7][20] Eventually, the city and Fehr agreed on permanent easements that cost the city a one-time fee of $99,000.[21]"

He was to go over the bridge while fellow skydiver Jeb Corliss was to go under it. Misjudging his distance from the bridge,  Weston struck a railing while traveling an estimated 120\u00a0mph, severing his leg at the hip. He fell onto a ledge in the gorge under a parachute that had opened on impact, though it is assumed he had already died.[23][24][25] Between March and May 2012, three people committed suicide by jumping off the bridge. The average number of suicides in the previous twelve years had been one per year according to the general manager for the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park.

A grand reopening ceremony took place on May 8, 2015 after the completion of $30 million in repairs.[12][13] The rebuilding plan did not include the wildlife park and those animals were relocated.[9] The bridge entry is open daily from 7\u00a0am until dusk with the visitor center, rides and attractions opening at 10\u00a0am, weather permitting.[15] Attractions that have been refurbished or rebuilt since the fire include a visitor center with an observation deck, a water clock, gondolas to replace the aerial trams, Plaza Theater and Historical Expo, Children's Playland,[30] and the original Royal Rush Skycoaster.[11] The Cloudscraper Zip Line\u00a0\u2014 the highest in North America\u00a0\u2014 opened on March 28, 2015.[14][31] The damaged Incline Railway and the Silver Rock Railway are not listed among current rides and attractions.[30] In January 2016, the Royal Gorge Company of Colorado paid the city a record high $2.1 million lease payment. Attendance in 2015 was the highest in the park's history at nearly 350,000 visitors. The attendance figure represented an increase of 20% from the attendance of about 292,000 in 2012, the last full year of operations before the 2013 fire.[32] For the 2013 season the city was paid $1.68 million by the park's operating company, mostly from business continuation insurance. Park officials estimated after the fire that more than 26 million people had visited the park since it opened in 1929.[33]"

They had formed committees to lobby government officials and found themselves caught in political processes that ultimately resulted in the city and its residents sustaining devastating damage. In August 1935, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill for nine flood control reservoirs to be built above Pittsburgh. However, while the Senate debated this bill, the tremendous 1936 flood occurred. The Congress did not actually appropriate any funds for the project until the 1937 flood which threatened, but spared the city and went on to devastate the Ohio River Valley."

They and their tributaries were already over their banks and were threatening the city of Pittsburgh. On Tuesday, March 17, the waters reached flood stage of 25 feet. Heavy rains overnight caused the waters to rise quickly, and on March 18, the water peaked at about 46 feet, 21 feet above flood stage. Four days later, on March 21, the water finally receded to 24 feet."

Steel mills that were located around the three rivers suffered devastating damage and 60,000 steel workers within a thirty-mile radius were out of work due to the damage that the mills suffered. Sixty five percent of the downtown business district had been under water from the Point all the way up to Grant Street. Electric power failed on March 17 and full electric service was not restored for eight days. KDKA radio was able to broadcast without interruption throughout the flood but Pittsburghers were unable to listen because they did not have electricity to run their radios. The contamination of the water supply led Pittsburgh residents to be told to boil water for fear of a typhoid epidemic. This fear was never realized; whether it was from the boiling of water or just luck is unknown. At least 69 deaths occurred in western Pennsylvania, including 45 in the city.[1] There was no train service because the railroad tracks that ran along the three rivers were blocked or washed away by the flood. Trolleys were also affected by the power loss and some were abandoned where they were when power was lost. Roads around the rivers were washed away or buckled and there was a gasoline shortage because there was no electricity to run the pumps. St. Patrick's Church was able to hold dedication ceremonies on St. Patrick's Day despite the rain, but nearby St. Stanislaus suffered severe flooding and pews were seen floating down the street. The pastor had to be rescued from the second floor. Relief workers consisting of police, firemen and the National Guard secured the city and protected public safety. The absence of electricity caused the pumps at the water intake facility to fail, and left firefighters unable to fight fires. These fires had been burning for days because of the lack of water pressure in the fire hydrants. The Red Cross provided food, clothing and medical supplies, while the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps rescued people from flooded houses and assisted in the cleanup after waters receded. On March 20, days after the initial flooding, receding waters and debris fields caused rumors that the massive 16th Street Bridge had collapsed. Although false, the hysteria forced the Pittsburgh Police to declare all bridges closed until they were spot checked.[1] Many buildings in Pittsburgh, particularly in or near downtown, have markers indicating the height reached by floodwaters. The flood eventually led to calls for the construction of a dam upstream on the Allegheny to prevent future floods of this magnitude. Laws providing for the construction of the dam were passed in 1936 and 1938, but it would take nearly three decades, and a bitter fight with the Seneca Nation of Indians, before the Kinzua Dam was finally completed in 1965. The Kinzua Dam, despite the delays, was completed in time to protect Pittsburgh from serious damage when Hurricane Agnes hit in 1972.[2]"

Waters raged from New York and Connecticut to New Hampshire and Maine. The Connecticut River reached flood stage at 38 feet, and 28 people died in Connecticut alone, as Hartford was paralyzed by the rising water. The National Guard was called in to save stranded residents. Significant flooding also occurred in New Hampshire, as the Merrimack River crested above 18 feet. In total, storm costs were over $520 million. (equivalent to $6.6 billion in 2015 dollars).[7][8]"

It was preceded by weeks of continuous rains and snows that began in Oregon in November 1861 and continued into January 1862. This was followed by a record amount of rain from January 9\u201312, and contributed to a flood that extended from the Columbia River southward in western Oregon, and through California to San Diego, as well as extending as far inland as the Washington Territory (now Idaho), the Utah Territory (now Nevada and Utah), and the western New Mexico Territory (now Arizona). The event dumped an equivalent of 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) of water in California, in the form of rain and snow, over a period of 43 days.[3][4] Immense snowfalls in the mountains of far western North America caused more flooding in Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, as well as in Baja California and Sonora, Mexico the following spring and summer, as the snow melted. The event was capped by an intense, warm storm that melted the heavy snow load that had accumulated during the earlier storms. The resulting snow-melt flooded valleys, inundated or swept away towns, mills, dams, flumes, houses, fences, and domestic animals, and ruined fields. It has been described as the worst disaster ever to strike California.[5] The storms caused an estimated $100 million (1861 USD) in damage, roughly equal to $3 billion in 2021. The governor, state legislature, and state employees were not paid for a year and a half.[2] At least 4,000 people were estimated to have been killed in the floods in California, which was roughly 1% of the state population at the time.[1]"

        "header": "Background",
        "content": "The weather pattern that caused this flood was not from an El Ni\u00f1o\u2013type event. From the existing Army and private weather records, it has been determined that the polar jet stream was to the north because the Pacific Northwest experienced a mild rainy pattern for the first half of December 1861. In 2012, hydrologists and meteorologists concluded that the precipitation was likely caused by a series of atmospheric rivers that hit the Western United States along the entire West Coast, from Oregon to Southern California.[6] An atmospheric river is a wind-borne, deep layer of water vapor with origins in the tropics, extending from the surface to high altitudes, often above 10,000 feet, and concentrated into a relatively narrow band, typically about 400 to 600 kilometres (250 to 370\u00a0mi) wide, usually running ahead of a frontal boundary, or merging into it.[7][8]  With the right dynamics in place to provide lift, an atmospheric river can produce astonishing amounts of precipitation, especially if it stalls over an area for any length of time. The floods followed a 20-year-long drought.[9] During November, prior to the flooding, Oregon had steady but heavier-than-normal rainfall, with heavier snow in the mountains.[10]:\u200a76\u201383\u200a Researchers believe the jet stream had slipped south, accompanied by freezing conditions reported at Oregon stations by December 25. Heavy rainfall began falling in California as the longwave trough moved south over the state, remaining there until the end of January 1862, causing precipitation to fall everywhere in the state for nearly 40 days. Eventually, the trough moved even further south, causing snow to fall in the Central Valley and surrounding mountain ranges (15 feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada).[11][12]"

It was cold enough at the higher elevations that much snow fell in the Cascade Range, which, when later melted by the warm rains produced a great quantity of water that flooded into the Willamette River and other streams in the Cascades. Tributaries of the Willamette originating in the Oregon Coast Range did not rise as high. A tropical depression that came in at the beginning of December produced strong, warm southerly winds in Oregon, with extremely heavy rain. Flooding was heaviest on rivers with tributaries arising from the snow-covered Cascade Range.[10] The crest of the Willamette flood was reached at Salem on December 3; at Oregon City on the 4th; at Milwaukie, between Oregon City and Portland, on the 5th; at Albany on December 8. The crests at Albany and Salem were the highest ever known at any time. In Oregon, the flood was one of the largest in the recorded history of the Willamette Valley and the rest of Western Oregon. An article in the December\u00a014, 1861, Oregon City Argus, described the course of the flood at Oregon City: During the month of November the rain had been falling almost continuously, and a vast amount of snow must have accumulated in the mountains... Tuesday evening a gloom settled on a scene such as probably never was witnessed in our Valley before. The ceaseless roar of the stream made a fearful elemental music widely different from the ordinary monotone of the Falls; while the darkness was only made more visible by the glare of torches and hurrying lights, which with the shouts of people from the windows of houses surrounded by the water, all conspired to render the hour one of intense and painful excitement. The flood has covered the highest mark of January '53, and is still rapidly rising. As late as anything could be seen the mills were still standing, but the insatiate monster is still creeping up inch by inch, winding its swelling folds round the pillars and foundations of all the houses in its way, crushing and grinding them in the maw of destruction, and sweeping the broken fragments into a common vortex of ruin. All night as on the night previous, people whose homes were being invaded hurried to places of security, glad to escape even with the sacrifice of all their goods. The light of Wednesday morning revealed a scene of desolation terrible in its extent no less than in its completeness. The Oregon City and Island Mills, Willamette Iron Works, Foundry and Machine Shop were all gone...[10]:\u200a76\u201377 Flood waters were so high that at Oregon City at the flood's crest on December 5, the steamer St. Clair was able to run the falls, and steamers were able to visit points at some distance from the normal river channel. Although large amounts of wheat and flour were swept away, some was recovered when Oregon City's Island Mill was found on Sauvie Island downriver from Portland. The nearby town of Linn City was completely destroyed by flooding and was not rebuilt.[13] The flood destroyed the historic towns of Champoeg, site of the first provisional government in Oregon, and Orleans, across the Willamette River from Corvallis. Neither was rebuilt.[10]:\u200a78 The flooding was also severe in other parts of Oregon; to the south, the Umpqua River had the greatest flood known even to the oldest Native Americans, and water was 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6\u00a0m) higher than the 1853 flood. It rose from November 3 to December 3, subsided for two days, then rose again until the 9th. At Fort Umpqua, communication upriver was cut off above Scottsburg, and the river was full of floating houses, barns, rails and produce. The Coquille River swept away settlers' property and there was also great damage on the Rogue River and on other small streams.\"[10]:\u200a78\u201379 Economic losses from flood damage were severe, as the rivers in Oregon were the main routes of travel. The riverfront was the building site of mills, freight depots, and storehouses for grain and other foodstuffs. Business houses and many residences were near the landings. Farm buildings were mostly on sites convenient to the rivers and supplies of feed for livestock. Loss of so much wheat flour and the new demand coming since 1860 from the recently opened Idaho gold fields caused a spike in its price from $7 to $12 per barrel."

Flooding on the Columbia River and the snow in the mountains closed off supplies to the new mining towns on the Salmon River, causing starvation among the miners of Florence, cut off from December until May 1862. By early July, as the heavy burden of snow in the mountains finally melted, the runoff caused great flooding. The Boise River flooded from extremely high runoff and is believed to have been four times larger than its largest recorded flood in 1943.

The ground was covered with snow 1 foot [30\u00a0cm] deep, and on the mountains much deeper... The water in the river ... seemed like some mighty uncontrollable monster of destruction broken away from its bonds, rushing uncontrollably on, and everywhere carrying ruin and destruction in its course. When rising, the river seemed highest in the middle... From the head settlement to the mouth of the Trinity River, for a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, everything was swept to destruction. Not a bridge was left, or a mining-wheel or a sluce-box. Parts of ranches and miners cabins met the same fate. The labor of hundreds of men, and their savings of years, invested in bridges, mines and ranches, were all swept away. In forty-eight hours the valley of the Trinity was left desolate. The county never recovered from that disastrous flood. Many of the mining-wheels and bridges were never rebuilt.[21] Two years later William H. Brewer saw near Crescent City, the debris of the flood: The floods of two years ago brought down an immense amount of driftwood from all the rivers along the coast, and it was cast up along this part of the coast in quantities that stagger belief. It looked to me as if I saw enough in ten miles along the shore to make a million cords of wood.... One I measured was 210 feet [64\u00a0m] long and 3 1/2 feet [1.1 m] at the little end, without the bark.[22]:\u200a495"

Transportation, mail, and communications across the state were disrupted for a month.[24] Water covered portions of the valley from December 1861, through the spring, and into the summer of 1862.[17] The rainy season commenced on the 8th of November, and for four weeks, with scarcely any intermission, the rain continued to fall very gently in San Francisco, but in heavy showers in the interior. According to the statement of a Grass Valley paper, nine inches of rain fell there in thirty-six hours on the 7th and 8th inst.... the next day the river-beds were full almost to the hilltops. The North Fork of the American River at Auburn rose thirty-five feet, and in many other mountain streams the rise was almost as great. On the 9th the flood reached the low land of the Sacramento Valley.[10] In Knight's Ferry, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada astride the Stanislaus River, about 40 miles (64\u00a0km) east of Modesto, the town's homes, its mill, and most of its businesses were ruined by the flood. The bridge spanning the river initially withstood the flood waters but was destroyed when the debris of the bridge at Two-Mile Bar, only a short distance up river, torn from its foundation, crashed into the Knights Ferry Bridge, crushing the truss supports and knocking it from its rock foundation.[25]  All Sacramento, excepting one street, part of Marysville, part of Santa Rosa, part of Auburn, part of Sonora, part of Nevada City, and part of Napa were under water.[26] Some smaller towns like Empire City and Mokelumne City were entirely destroyed."

The New York Times reported on January 21, 1862, that a trapper who had spent more than 20 years in California had frequently boated over the city's site, and in 1846, the water at the location was 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) deep for sixty days.[26] On 27 December 1861, the Sacramento River reached a flood level of 22\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches (6.88\u00a0m) above the low water mark, after rising 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) during the past 24 hours.[17] By 1861, the Sacramento flood plain had quickly become inhabited by a growing population during the Gold Rush, and had begun to serve as the central hub for Valley commerce and trade and as the home of the California State Legislature. The landscape was recognized as a flood-prone landscape located at the confluence of the American and Sacramento River. John Muir noted the extent of seasonal flooding in Sacramento, \"\u2026The greatest floods occur in winter, when one could suppose all the wild waters would be muffled and chained in frost and snow\u2026rare intervals warm rains and warm winds invade the mountains and push back the snow line from 2000 to 8,000 feet, or even higher, and then come the big floods.\"[27] However, the series of storms that led to the Great Flood of 1862 averaged precipitation levels that records show only occur once every 500 to 1,000 years.[28] The geographical range of flooding in the state was noted by a traveling geologist from Yale University, William Brewer, who wrote that on January 19, 1862, The great Central Valley of the state is under water\u2014the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys\u2014a region 250 to 300 miles long and an average of at least 20 miles wide, a district of 5,000 or 6,000 square miles, or probably three to three and a half million acres! Although much of it is not cultivated, yet a part of it is the garden of the state. Thousands of farms are entirely under water\u2014cattle starving and drowning. From December to January 1862 the series of storms carrying high winds and heavy precipitation left city streets and sidewalks underwater. Photographs show  canals in place of city streets and boats docked to storefronts.[29] On Inauguration Day, January 10, 1862, the state's eighth governor, Leland Stanford, traveled by rowboat to his inauguration building held at the State Legislature office. Much of Sacramento remained under water for 3 months after the storms passed. As a result of the flooding, from January 23, 1862, the state capital was moved temporarily from Sacramento to San Francisco.[17]"

When the floodwaters entered from the higher ground on the east, the levee acted as a dam to keep the water in the city rather than let it flow out. Soon the water level was 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) higher inside than the level of the Sacramento River on the outside.[10] John Carr wrote of his riverboat trip up the Sacramento River when it was at one of its highest stages of flood: ...\u00a0I was a passenger on the old steamer Gem, from Sacramento to Red Bluff. The only way the pilot could tell where the channel of the river was, was by the cottonwood trees on each side of the river. The boat had to stop several times and take men out of the tops of trees and off the roofs of houses. In our trip up the river we met property of every description floating down\u2014dead horses and cattle, sheep, hogs, houses, haystacks, household furniture, and everything imaginable was on its way for the ocean. Arriving at Red Bluff, there was water everywhere as far as the eye could reach, and what few bridges there had been in the country were all swept away.[10] Dozens of wood houses, some two stories high, were simply lifted up and carried off by the flood, as was \"all the firewood, most of the fences and sheds, all the poultry, cats, rats and many of the cows and horses\". The Chinese in their poorly built shantytowns were disproportionately affected.[17] A chain gang was sent to break open the levee, which, when it finally broke, allowed the waters to rush out of the city center and lowered the level of the flooding by 5\u20136 feet (1.5\u20131.8\u00a0m). Eventually the waters fell to a level on a par with the lowest part of the city.[10]"

Due to the high costs associated with flood recovery, the city of Sacramento reached out to the aid of the Transcontinental Railroad Co., which was a major turning point in levee resilience and reconstruction. Prior to the great flood, levee breaks and failures caused much destruction from flooding. The Transcontinental Railroad had laid tracks across the Sierra Nevada and stationed its major repair and production line in Sacramento. The Chinese workforce of over 14,000 reconstructed levees under the guidance of Charles Crocker, the head contractor for Central Pacific Railroad.[31] In response to a weak levee system and seasonal flooding, flood plain architecture was incorporated in residential infrastructure, evident in Victorian buildings throughout Midtown to Downtown Sacramento. Flood design includes raised front porches with stairs leading down to the street. In addition, small hollow spaces are built into the basement level to allow for basement flooding and aeration.[32] Old Town Sacramento was raised 15 feet above flood level. Ruins of the old city remain underneath the streets as tunnels leading nowhere, with hollow sidewalks, filled in entrances, trap doors, and rubble where storefronts and walkways used to be. Large wooden beams and soil brought in from surrounding areas helped to stabilize and build a foundation on top of the once-flooded city.[33]"

No mail was received at Los Angeles for five weeks. The Los Angeles Star reported that: The road from Tejon, we hear, has been almost washed away. The San Fernando mountain cannot be crossed except by the old trail ... over the top of the mountain. The plain has been cut up into gulches and arroyos, and streams are rushing down every declivity.[35] The plains of Los Angeles County, at the time a marshy area with many small lakes and several meandering streams from the mountains, were extensively flooded, and much of the agricultural development that lay along the rivers was ruined. In most of the lower areas, small settlements were submerged. These flooded areas formed into a large lake system with many small streams. A few more powerful currents cut channels across the plain and carried the runoff to the sea.[36] In Los Angeles County, (including what is now Orange County) the flooding Santa Ana River created an inland sea lasting about three weeks with water standing 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) deep up to 4 miles (6\u00a0km) from the river.[23] In February 1862, the Los Angeles, San Gabriel, and Santa Ana Rivers merged. Government surveys at the time indicated that a solid expanse of water covered the area from Signal Hill to Huntington Beach, a distance of approximately 18 miles (29\u00a0km).[37]:\u200a38 At Santa Barbara County, the narrow coastal plains were flooded by the rivers coming out of the mountains. The San Buenaventura Mission Aqueduct that was still drawing water from a tributary of the Ventura River for the town of Ventura water system, was abandoned due to the damage in the area that became the separate Ventura County in 1873.[38] In San Bernardino County, all the fertile riverside fields and all but the church and one house of the New Mexican colony of Agua Mansa, were swept away by the Santa Ana River, which overflowed its banks. A local priest rang the church bell on the night of January 22, 1862, alerting the inhabitants to the approach of the flood, and all escaped.[39][40] In San Diego, a storm at sea backed up the flood water running into the bay from the San Diego River, resulting in a new river channel cut into San Diego Harbor. The continuous heavy downpour also changed the look of the land, the previously rounded hills were extensively cut by gulleys and canyons.[37] To the north, in the Owens Valley, similar snow and flooding conditions as those to the east in Aurora, Nevada (see below), led to the local Paiute suffering the loss of much of the game they depended on. Cattle, newly driven into the valley to feed the miners, competed with the native grazers and ate the native wild plant crops the Paiute depended on to survive. Starving, the Paiute began to kill the cattle and conflict with the cattlemen began, leading to the subsequent Owens Valley Indian War."

Full of sediment, the silted water smothered the oyster beds.[17]  One-quarter of California's estimated 800,000 cattle were killed by the flood, accelerating the end of the cattle-based ranchero society. One-fourth[17] to one-third of the state's property was destroyed, and one home in eight was carried away or ruined by the flood-waters.[24] Mining equipment such as sluices, flumes, wheels and derricks were carried away across the state.[17] An early estimate of property damage was $10\u00a0million.[26] However, later it was estimated that approximately one-quarter of the taxable real estate in the state of California was destroyed in the flood.[41] The state almost had to declare bankruptcy due to the costs of the damage and the loss of tax revenue.[5]"

Two feet (61\u00a0cm) of wet heavy snow fell on December\u00a020, 1861, accumulating on the valley floor. Snow was followed by a period of very cold temperatures which froze the snow, followed by a three-day rain starting on December 25, 1861. By January 2, 1862, the town of Dayton and the area surrounding it had been flooded.[42] In the vicinity of Aurora, there had been light snowfall in November, then mild weather until Christmas Eve, when there began a heavy and rapid snowfall for days. The temperature dropped below zero and the passes over the Sierra were closed. During the second week of January, it warmed slightly, and the snow became a torrential rain. Esmerelda and Willow gulches overflowed their banks and flooded Aurora. With water standing up to 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) deep in many buildings, adobe buildings turned to mud and collapsed. After a week, it cooled again, and snow began to fall again. Within a few days, the snow was deeper than it had been before the rains had begun to fall. Samuel Young of Aurora recorded in his diary that the snow and rain had fallen for 26 days out of 30 since December\u00a024, 1861.[43]"

On January\u00a020, 1862, the Colorado River began to rise, and on the afternoon of January 22 it rose suddenly in three hours from an already high stage nearly 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m), overflowing its banks and turned Fort Yuma in California into an island in the midst of the Colorado River. At 1 o\u2019clock on the morning of January 23, the river reached its crest.[47] Jaeger City a mile down river from Fort Yuma, and Colorado City, across the Colorado River from it were washed away. The river overflowed its banks to the extent that there was water 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) deep on a ranch in the low-lying ground just above Arizona City where the Gila River joined the Colorado. The riverside home of steamboat entrepreneur George Alonzo Johnson and the nearby Hooper residence were the only places in the town unharmed because they were built on high ground.[48] Colorado City had to be rebuilt on higher ground after the 1862 flood.[49] The Gila River also flooded, covering its whole valley at its mouth where it met the Colorado from the sand hills on the south to the foothills on the north. Twenty miles (32\u00a0km) to the east of Fort Yuma, it swept away most of the mining boomtown of Gila City along with a supply of hay being gathered there to supply the planned advance of the California Column into Confederate Arizona. Further east the road was flooded, buildings and vehicles swept away and traffic was disrupted for some time thereafter by the mud covering the road to Tucson.[50] The great flood in the Gila and Colorado rivers, covered their bottom lands with mud. Much of the livestock along the rivers drowned and the crops of the Indians along the river were destroyed.[51] The overflow of the 1862 Colorado River spring flood waters reached the Salton Sink via the Alamo and New Rivers, filling it and creating a lake some 60 miles (97\u00a0km) long and 30 miles (48\u00a0km) wide.[52]"

Mesilla, built on the west bank of the Rio Grande, was left by the movement of the river on its east bank where it remains today. The flood impeded the Union Army's California Column as it pursued the retreating Confederate Army of New Mexico. On July 8, 1862, Lt. Col. Edward E. Eyre, First California Volunteer Cavalry wrote: The Rio Grande has been unusually high this summer, almost the entire bottom between Fort Craig and Mesilla being still overflowed. It is impossible at this time to approach Mesilla on the west side of the river, a new channel having been washed out on that side of the town, through which the largest portion of the water flows; besides, the bottom for a long distance is overflowed, and, the soil being of a loose nature, animals mire down in attempting to get through it.[53] Instead of crossing at Mesilla, the high waters and shift of the river forced Eyre's detachment to cross the Rio Grande upriver at the San Diego Crossing below Fort Thorn, after a week awaiting the water to go down, that enabled the Confederates' escape into Texas."

The mouth of this slough was only 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) from the mouth of the river and sheltered from the extremes of the tidal bore of the Colorado River and deep enough to prevent stranding on shoals or mud flats at low tide.[54]  This made it an ideal anchorage for maritime craft to load and unload their cargo and passengers from the steamboats that took them up and down river without the danger from the tides that they were having to risk in the estuary at Robinson's Landing. In the month of March 1865, the schooner Isabel, from San Francisco, commanded by W. H. Pierson, found and entered this slough and discharged her cargo there for the first time. Subsequently, the steamers, sailing ships and later ocean-going steamships loaded and off-loaded their cargoes there, and the steamboat company established Port Isabel 2.5 miles (4.0\u00a0km) above the mouth of the slough. The port lasted until 1878. After the Southern Pacific Railroad reached Yuma, it was abandoned the following year, the shipyard there being removed to Yuma.[55]"

The eighth named storm of the 2020\u201a\u00c4\u00ec21 European windstorm season, Filomena formed over the Atlantic Ocean close to the Canary Islands on 7\u00a0January, subsequently taking a slow track north-eastwards towards the Iberian Peninsula and then eastwards across the Mediterranean Sea. As Filomena was crossing the Iberian Peninsula, the leading edge of the storm collided with cold air that was being channeled down from the Arctic by an area of high pressure centred over the United Kingdom; the constant supply of cold air and slow movement of Filomena resulted in persistent heavy snowfall, reaching up to 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) in Madrid. At least 5 people were killed due to the effects of cold weather in Spain during the passage of Filomena: three in Madrid and two in M\u221a\u00b0laga. Impacts elsewhere were minimal as Filomena moved away from the high to its north, lost its supply of cold air and weakened, and the storm was last noted over Ukraine on 15\u00a0January.

During the time of Filomena's passage over the Iberian Peninsula, a powerful high-pressure system, named Anticyclone Antje by the Free University of Berlin (FUB), was centred over the United Kingdom, bringing cold air from the Arctic across the British Isles and down into the vicinity of Storm Filomena. This cold air became entrained into the leading edge of Filomena as it pushed north-eastwards against the southern edge of the area of high pressure, leading to heavy snowfall. After emerging into the Mediterranean Sea, Filomena accelerated eastwards away from the area of high pressure, losing its supply of cold air in the process. Filomena crossed Italy on 11\u00a0January[7] with minimal impacts, before stalling again between Italy and Greece on 11\u201a\u00c4\u00ec12\u00a0January.[7][8] Considerably weakened by this time, Filomena then moved over Turkey and stalled for a third time on 13\u201a\u00c4\u00ec14\u00a0January,[9][10] before accelerating northwards across the eastern Black Sea on 15\u00a0January.[11] Filomena was last noted as a weak low over eastern Ukraine later that day,[11] before being absorbed by a deeper low named Cyclone Dimitrios by the FUB by 16\u00a0January.[12]"

This prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system early the next day.[2] However less than 3 hours later, the JTWC decided to issue advisories on the system designating it as Tropical Depression 22W, before the JMA reported that the depression had become a tropical storm and named it Nalgae.[1][3][4] The storm slowly drifted to the west and kept on intensifying gradually. On September 29, microwave imagery showed Nalgae developed an eyelike feature and well defined convective banding in all the quadrants. The system had a tiny radius of winds, though it was still strengthening significantly and was very well defined.[5] On the evening of September 28, the JMA reported that Nalgae continued to intensify, as they upgraded it to a severe tropical storm with winds of over 55 knots (102\u00a0km/h; 63\u00a0mph).[6] On that night, the PAGASA initiated advisories on Nalgae, giving it the local name Quiel, as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).[7] On the morning of September 29, the JTWC reported that Nalgae developed a small microwave eye like feature and multiple convective bands wrapped tightly into the center. Using the Dvorak technique, the JTWC estimated the average 1-minute sustained wind speed of Nalgae to be at 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph).[8] On that evening, the JMA further upgraded Nalgae to a typhoon.[9] Nalgae continued to drift westwards at approximately 13 knots (24\u00a0km/h; 15\u00a0mph) and continued to intensify. On the night of September 29, Nalgae's outflow to the east got more enhanced and the outflow in all other directions remained radial. Nalgae was running west quite quickly because of a strong and a deep subtropical ridge located to the east of the system. The JTWC anticipated Nalgae to continually strengthen before it made landfall over Luzon, Philippines.[10]  Continuing on its quick westward run, Nalgae developed a tiny 5 nautical miles (9.3\u00a0km; 5.8\u00a0mi) eye with a small break in the eyewall around the eastern periphery, because of a slight vertical wind shear as estimated by the JTWC. There was deep convective banding extending approximately 120 nautical miles (220\u00a0km; 140\u00a0mi) from the center and the overall outflow remained good. based on Dvorak intensity estimates, the winds of Nalgae were then raised to 95 knots (176\u00a0km/h; 109\u00a0mph).[11]"

The PAGASA weather bureau chief Graciano Yumul said that \"The ground is still supersaturated and it cannot absorb more water. This will just flow down to rivers and towns, and there is a big possibility that landslides, flash flooding and flooding could occur.\" The search and rescue operations for Typhoon Nesat were halted because of the fierce weather brought by Nalgae. The NOLCOM chief Major General Jessie Dellosa said \"Our rescue operations are ongoing with the use of watercraft and rubber boats. We are also continuously coordinating with the local government units to rescue the affected residents in Calumpit and Hagonoy.\"[18] The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council director Benito Ramos said that thousands of rescue workers were deployed across Luzon and the island's sparsely populated northeast coast was evacuated following the orders from the president Benigno Aquino III. Ramous said \"We're implementing persuasive evacuation operations. If I have to handcuff people to remove them from their homes I could be charged with human rights violations.\"[19] Nalgae was making a similar path across the saturated Luzon Island as Typhoon Nesat. The wind gusts brought by Nalgae toppled trees and blew away tin roofs of some houses in Isabela's provincial capital of Ilagan. Nalgae continued to worsen the flooding and destruction brought by Nesat. Nalgae was far more stronger than Nesat and plummeted the nation with more winds and rains.[20] The governor of Isabela province, Faustino Dy said that \"Hundreds of people in coastal areas had been evacuated as rain and strong cut power lines, uprooted trees and blocked roads with debris.\" He added that \"Nalgae could cause floods on Luzon's central plains before passing through La Union province, a tobacco-growing area, and then heading off into the South China Sea.\" Also, the PAGASA announced that an estimated 10\u201318\u00a0mm per hour of rains were experienced in several areas across the nation filling up dams and causing river systems to swell.[21] As the storm continued to move inland with strong winds, many structures including billboards, tarpaulins and wooden materials in the town of Cauayan were damaged. The barriers of the Isabela highway were also destroyed by the typhoon. The government responded quickly and cleared off all the debris on the highway and made it usable again.[22] According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDDRMC), the onslaught of the typhoon resulted in the death of 1 person living in the Mountain Province, a landlocked province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. It was reported that Sonny Marcos, a passenger on board a passenger van was buried alongside the Halsema Highway, the highest altitude highway in the Philippines that stretches from Baguio to Bontoc, Mountain Province.[23] [24][25] Nalgae only took about six hours to blow through the Luzon island. Office of Civil Defense administrator Benito Ramos told \"We are asking everyone still refusing to leave their homes to let authorities evacuate them.[26] The extremely strong winds blown by Nalgae set off a rockslide in northern Bontoc provincecausing boulders to roll down a mountainside and smash on a passing van, killing one man. In the rice-growing province of Bulacan north of Manila, several hundreds of people in several towns remained trapped on their rooftops as the floodwaters brought by Nesat never retreated and more flooding and rain was brought by Nalgae. Rescuers aboard rubber boats could not reach them because the alleyways were too narrow. Officials said that two army helicopters would be later deployed to rescue the victims.[27] The province of Pampanga was badly affected - mainly due to the already prevailing floods from the previous typhoon Typhoon Nesat (Pedring). The floods continued till 5 October - much after the rains subsided. Boats were brought out to navigate the roads that had turned into rivers. The ground floor of most houses remained under water up to 4 days after Quiel passed."

        "content": "The Rescue workers scrambled through the floodwaters on October 2, so that they could be able to deliver food, water and other relief materials to hundreds of villagers stuck on rooftops since several days after the twin typhoons ravaged the nation. Seven towns north of Manila including Calumpit in rice-growing Bulacan province continued to be under waist-high waters after the rains brought by Nalgae, the 17th tropical cyclone to affect the disaster-prone nation in 2011. Helicopters were able to deliver food via air, but could rescue none of those who were on the rooftops since 4 days.[28] The main problem with the evacuations was such that most of the victims refused to leave. The residents could do nothing but wade through the floodwaters, only to find the town hall completely submerged in water.[29] AirAsia, a Malaysian-based low-cost airline said that they would provide free aid to the victims of the twin typhoons in the Philippines. They announced that they would allocate special space in their cargo on its daily Manila bound flight. They also asked people who were interested to donate for the Filipinos could contact them at their email address, airasiacares@airasia.com.[30][31] On October 3, Philippine authorities rushed aid to thousands of people marooned in their flooded homes for a week since Nesat and Nalgae together battered the nation. After a long time, the flood water slowly started receding and the rescue workers were able to deliver food and other relief materials to those in need. In Calumpit. one of the worst hit towns, a construction worker in line for receiving the relief materials said to a new agency, \"We have no food to eat, and no clean drinking water.\"[32] Although floodwaters have begun to subside, thousands of families continued to stay in the evacuation centers as more than 43,000 houses were damaged by the typhoon Nesat alone. In the Pampanga province the typhoon breached several dikes or small channels developed for the flow of drain water. The destructive landslides brought by Nalgae cut off large portions of the Philippine highways isolating the town of Carranglan in Nueva Ecija.[33] Also, after the water receded, most of the victims refused to leave their homes and head for the evacuation centers as they feared that their houses could be easily robbed in such a situation. They asked for food and relief materials to be delivered to their house instead.[34] It was later reported that at least 8 million people living in the Philippines have experience faced much worse floods than the earlier destruction caused by typhoon Nesat. The disaster management chief Benito Ramos said \"The fight is not over yet. I hope the (Nesat) floods will wash out to Manila Bay before the (Nalgae) runoff hits the area. If the latter catches up to the former, there won\u2019t be any rooftops left to see above the floodwaters.\" The local weather agency announced that the water levels on the tributaries of major central Luzon rivers were still continuing to rise fast and posed a threat to the nearby towns and villages.[35]"

All three fires were started by lightning. As the fire moved into heavy dead timber in early June, thousands of firefighters struggled to prevent movement of the fires into populated areas.[1] It was composed of the West Fork fire, northeast of Pagosa Springs, Colorado, south of Wagon Wheel Gap, and southwest of South Fork, Colorado; the Papoose fire south of Creede, Colorado; and the small Windy Pass fire, near the Wolf Creek ski area. As of the afternoon of July 8: Much of the complex was in the Weminuche Wilderness but has burned into surrounding areas in the San Juan and Rio Grande National Forests and private land. The fires, particularly the West Fork fire, burned in dead trees killed by the spruce beetle. Due to the intensity of the West Fork fire which for some days was burning in windy conditions no attempt was made to directly attack it. Aggressive, and so far successful, efforts were made to prevent the Windy Pass fire from reaching the ski area. South Fork and Wagon Wheel Gap were evacuated and U.S. Highway 160 and State Highway 149 were closed to the west of South Fork. Route 160 was reopened at 6 AM June 29; Route 149 was reopened June 30. Most personnel were engaged in structure protection efforts to the west of South Fork, on the low terrain near the Rio Grande River to the north of the fires, and at tourist facilities south of Creede.[1][3] On the 19th of July when the last incident update was made the fires had a total area of 109,615 acres and were 66% contained with 43 personnel engaged in combating them; the fire was described as \"smoldering.\" There are two incident command posts, one in Pagosa Springs, Colorado for the portion of the fire on the west side of the Continental Divide, the other in Del Norte, Colorado for the portion on the east side. As of July 8 the portion of the West Fork fire west of the Continental Divide remained at 0% containment while the portion east of the Continental Divide was 25%.[1] There was about .20 of an inch of precipitation on some parts of the fire June 30 due to a thunderstorm, but strong and erratic winds also stimulated the fire. On July 4, 2013 the fires were described as \"creeping and smoldering\" with fire suppression efforts being directed at preventing the expansion of the fire into heavy stands of dead and down fuel. Growth of the fire had continued on the southeastern side of the Papoose fire but as of July 8 widespread showers had moderated fire behavior. As of July 14 humidity was gradually increasing as the monsoon season approached with occasional thunderstorms expected and flash flood warnings issued for the area. As of July 19 precipitation had considerably dampened the fire, but smoldering and smoke continued. \nAs of 2023, the West Complex fire is the 5th largest in Colorado state history. In 2020 3 fires larger than it burned more the 600,000 acres total pushing the West Fork complex down the list.[1]"

        "content": " Typhoon Saomai, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Osang, was a long-tracked and intense tropical cyclone that brought flooding rainfall in Japan and the Korean Peninsula in September\u00a02000. The torrential precipitation in Japan was considered some of the worst in the past century. Saomai, the second strongest typhoon in the western Pacific in 2000, developed from an area of disturbed weather in open sea on August\u00a031. The system was initially quick to intensify, reaching an initial peak intensity as a typhoon on September\u00a04. Wind shear caused a hiatus in Saomai's strengthening phase, and as a result Saomai weakened back to a tropical storm as it tracked northwest for the next few days. On September\u00a09, the system regained typhoon intensity and began to rapidly intensify, reaching peak intensity on September\u00a010 with maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph).[nb 1] Over the ensuing two days Saomai would weaken slightly before making landfall on Okinawa Island. The typhoon later entered the East China Sea, where it recurved towards the northeast before making landfall on South Korea as a severe tropical storm, later transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a016. Saomai's remnants would move into Russia before dissipating three days later. As a developing typhoon, the outer rainbands of Saomai affected the Mariana Islands, causing moderate damage. Localized power outages were reported, and damage totaled to US$650,000.[nb 2] Even before Saomai made landfall on Okinawa, the typhoon caused rough seas off the coast of Japan that resulted in several shipping incidents. Concurrently, the approach of a front into the country interacted with the typhoon, resulting in unprecedented rainfalls in Japan. Due to the floods, approximately 400,000\u00a0people were evacuated in three prefectures. In Nagoya, observed rainfall totals were the highest since records began in 1891. Despite making landfall on Okinawa, damage was not as severe, though several landslides and strong winds were reported. Overall, damage in Japan and its outlying islands totaled JP\u00a524.8\u00a0billion (US$223\u00a0million) and eleven fatalities were reported. As Saomai tracked near China, its outer rainbands and strong waves prompted the evacuation of 20,000\u00a0people and caused record high stream heights. In South Korea, eight people were killed and damage figures equated to US$71\u00a0million. Widespread power outages took a toll on as many as 422,000\u00a0homes and heavy rains flooded numerous fields of crops. Minor damage occurred in North Korea, though the damage wrought by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in the month was exacerbated by Saomai's impacts. In Russia, where the typhoon made landfall as an extratropical storm, nine people were killed due to car accidents spurred by rainfall caused by the Saomai. Overall, Saomai's effects resulted in the death of 28\u00a0people and roughly US$6.3\u00a0billion in damage.[1]"

        "content": "Typhoon Saomai emerged from an area of convection that developed well east of Guam in late-August. Though the disturbance was associated with a low-pressure area, the circulation center was too weak to support persistent shower activity.[2] Despite the satellite presentation, the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031.[3] Over the next few days, the system organized and curved towards the west from its initial northerly track.[2][3] At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02, the JMA upgraded the small depression to tropical storm intensity.[3] Within Saomai, convection deepened near the center, signifying continued intensification. A cold central dense overcast eventually developed,[2] and at 1200\u00a0UTC the next day, Saomai became a severe tropical storm. Early on September\u00a04, the tropical cyclone intensified further into a typhoon.[3] At the time, Saomai was still well northeast of Guam.[2] Upon reaching typhoon strength, Saomai attained an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[3] Shortly after, despite the fact that a primitive eye had begun to develop, wind shear increased, shearing the storm's convection away.[2] As a result, the JMA downgraded Saomai below typhoon strength on September\u00a05,[3] and at roughly the same time a subtropical ridge to the storm's southeast steered Saomai southward. This break in the storm's westerly course was short lived, and early on September\u00a06, Saomai assumed its previous heading. Over time the shearing conditions gradually abated, and rainbanding about the cyclone was showing signs of organization and strengthening. On September\u00a08, Saomai finally re-developed a central dense overcast,[2] prompting the JMA to upgrade the tropical storm back to typhoon intensity at 0000\u00a0UTC the following day. Back in  favorable conditions, the typhoon entered a phase of rapid intensification beginning six hours later.[4] During this period a well-defined eye developed, and the storm's eyewall significantly intensified.[2] At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, Saomai reached its peak intensity with sustained winds estimated at 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.32\u00a0inHg). The intense typhoon held this intensity for approximately nine hours before it began to weaken.[3] Following peak intensity, Saomai's eye became cloud-filled, and the storm began to develop concentric eyewalls.[2] Shortly after 1000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, the typhoon made landfall on central Okinawa, Japan with sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 945\u00a0mbar (945\u00a0hPa; 27.9\u00a0inHg).[3] Saomai quickly passed over the island, and concurrently its weakening phase came to a halt. After tracking into the East China Sea, the typhoon began to track towards the northeast in response to a mid-latitude trough. At its westernmost point along its track, Saomai was located approximately 345\u00a0km (214\u00a0mi) east of Wenzhou, China. Atmospheric conditions became increasingly more hostile as Saomai tracked northeast, and the typhoon became elongated and ragged in appearance.[2] At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, Saomai was downgraded to severe tropical storm intensity as the cyclone began to undergo extratropical transition.[2][3] At around 2030\u00a0UTC that day, Saomai made its final landfall as a tropical system west of Pusan, South Korea;[2] after emerging into the Yellow Sea the storm was declared extratropical at 0600\u00a0UTC the next day. These remnants later tracked inland near Vladivostok, Russia before dissipating on September\u00a019.[3]"

In Tianan, some banana trees were damaged by the storm's affects. Damage from the islands amounted to US$650,000, with $600,000\u00a0to infrastructure.[6] The presence of the nearby tropical cyclone caused the delaying of two flights and the cancellation of another at Antonio B.

Another occupant of the boat was rescued three hours after the sinking by police helicopter.[7] The waves also caused a dozen containers from the South Korean Heunga Nagoya to fall into the sea 5.5\u00a0km (3.4\u00a0mi) off the coast of Susami and Wakayama Prefecture.[8] Off of Oita Prefecture, the waves were the impetus for red tides, resulting in significant marine loss.[9] The approach of the typhoon towards Okinawa coincided with the approach of a weather front over mainland Japan, resulting in prolonged rainfall over the mainland. The rains caused extensive flooding, prompting the Cabinet of Japan to make reassurances in the repair of the ensuing damage.[10] Rail service along the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka was suspended for more than 18\u00a0hours at one point, the longest delay to be enforced in the rail's service history.[11][12] As a result, 50,000\u00a0passengers were forced to wait out the storm in the line's stopped trains.[13] Toyota closed 24\u00a0of its manufacturing plants, resulting in the incompletion of 10,000\u00a0vehicles.[12] Similarly, Mitsubishi stopped production at two of its facilities in Nagoya.[14] Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, and Japan Air System cancelled a combined 114\u00a0flights, which adversely affected about 21,000\u00a0people.[15] Across the country, rainfall peaked at 1,000\u00a0mm (39\u00a0in) in Miyagawa, Mie; the same station also recorded 522\u00a0mm (20.6\u00a0in) of rain in a single 24-hour period.[16] As a result of the flooding in Mie, 2,819\u00a0homes were inundated and 25\u00a0landslides occurred. Several buildings succumbed to the water and thus collapsed.[17][18] Extensive power outage occurred in Kagoshima Prefecture, affecting approximately 4,500\u00a0households. In addition, the heavy rains caused damage to agriculture, including sugar cane crops. Damage in the prefecture totaled JP\u00a5356\u00a0million (US$3\u00a0million).[19] Similar effects were felt across Kyushu.[20] Several flights into Nagasaki Prefecture were cancelled; the rains there also caused agricultural damage totaling JP\u00a599\u00a0million (US$900,000).[21] Flooding also occurred on Shikoku, where rainfall totals peaked at 976\u00a0mm (38.4\u00a0in) in Funato, K\u014dchi.[16] Severe damage occurred elsewhere in K\u014dchi, where combined forestry and agricultural damage figures reached JP\u00a52.1\u00a0billion (US$19\u00a0million).[22] In Tokushima Prefecture, several landslides occurred, disrupting transportation routes.[23] Record rainfall was observed in Aichi Prefecture, with 511\u00a0mm (20.1\u00a0in) of rain in Tokai and 532\u00a0mm (20.9\u00a0in) of rain in Nagoya in a span of a single day; both observations were the highest since records began in 1891. Due to the threat of landslides in Nagoya, the municipal government ordered the evacuation of 140,000\u00a0families. In the ward of Nakagawa-ku, two rivers overflowed their banks and over-topped the surrounding embankment.[11] Two tornadoes occurred in the prefecture, with one striking Mihama and another striking Minamichita; the former tornado injured 22\u00a0people, of which two were hospitalized.[24] Another 41,000\u00a0families encompassing 400,000 people were evacuated across Aichi, Gifu, and Mie prefectures as a precautionary measure.[15][25] Damage in Okinawa, the site of Saomai's first landfall, was considerable but not unprecedented. On September\u00a010, the provincial government established a disaster warning headquarters on Daito Island to more efficiently deal with the typhoon's effects.[26]  Rainfall peaked on Mount Yonaha, where a station recorded 537\u00a0mm (21.1\u00a0in) of rain.[16] During the storm, 31\u00a0roads sustained damage and 26\u00a0landslides occurred. Damage in Okinawa Prefecture reached JP\u00a5636\u00a0million (US$6\u00a0million).[26] Overall, Saomai caused the destruction of 609\u00a0homes and the inundation of 70,017\u00a0others in Japan. Damage costs in the country totaled JP\u00a524.8\u00a0billion (US$223\u00a0million). Eleven people were killed and 103\u00a0others suffered injury.[16] At the height of the storm, over 17,000\u00a0people had been displaced in emergency shelters.[27]"

Other suspensions of transportation included the refuge of 362\u00a0fishing boats in ports and the closure of 10\u00a0national parks and 43\u00a0mountain paths. As a result, about 16,600\u00a0campers and hikers were evacuated to safer areas.[29] As a result of the inclement weather, the operation of 149\u00a0passenger ships were cancelled.[30] On September\u00a013, the Korea Meteorological Administration\u00a0(KMA) issued a typhoon warning for waters south of South Korea and Jeju Province.[31] The administration anticipated heavy rainfall, though not as much as what had taken place in Japan.[32] Offshore, an Indonesian freighter with 39\u00a0crewmen became stranded by the typhoon in waters south of Pusan. The crew were rescued by maritime police, but 270\u00a0tons of oil spilled into the ocean from a broken oil container.[30] In South Korea, the northern and southern Gyeongsang provinces were the most heavily impacted. At least 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres) of paddy fields were flooded.[30] Heavy rains caused the Nakdong River to breach a section of embankment, prompting the evacuation of 100\u00a0families. Flood warnings were issued by the KMA on sections of the river for the first time in 2000.[33] In South Gyeongsang, an electricity pylon collapsed, cutting power supply to about 700\u00a0houses.[34] Strong winds uprooted trees and destroyed homes and fishing boats in Pusan.[35] Countrywide, losses were initially estimated at KR\u20a920\u00a0billion (US$18\u00a0million),[30] though these figures later rose to US$71\u00a0million.[nb 3] As a result of Saomai, eight people were killed, and 411\u00a0others were displaced. More than 600\u00a0buildings were either inundated or destroyed entirely.[35] At the height of the storm, roughly 422,000\u00a0households were without power, primarily in northern and southern Gyeongsang provinces.[36] Relatively minor damage occurred in North Korea,[37][38] previously impacted by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in September.[39] Rainfall peaked at 147\u00a0mm (5.8\u00a0in) in Kaesong.[2] Saomai somewhat exacerbated the unprecedented damage caused by Prapiroon, and damaged maize crops which were set to be harvested in the coming weeks.[40]"

Over 20,000\u00a0people were evacuated by the Chinese government onto higher land.[42] The most severely affected Chinese province was Zhejiang.[41] A station in Dinghai District observed 102\u00a0mm (4.0\u00a0in) of rain in 18\u00a0hours, equivalent to more than half of that station's monthly average.[2] In Zhoushan, 20,000\u00a0hectares of farmland were inundated and 2,500\u00a0homes collapsed.[41] Off the island, ten fishing boats collided, and another oil tanker capsized.[43] Areas in Gaoting were submerged under as much as 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) of water.[42] Off the coast, 225\u00a0boats and 130\u00a0piers were damaged.[41] In Shanghai, 20\u00a0streets were flooded and hundreds of homes were flooded with water.[44] At nearby Hongqiao Airport, an Airbus A340 bound for Paris slipped off the runway. Though no people were injured, the airport was closed for eight hours. The typhoon also caused the Huangpu River to rise to its third highest level in recorded history.[43] Despite being a much weaker storm upon impacting Russia,[2] Saomai's rains flooded coal retrieval sites, cutting down on electric power supplies in Primorsky Krai. Due to the shortages, electric power was transferred there from other surrounding areas.[45] Furthermore, a 50\u00a0percent decrease in electricity output was documented at the local power station in Luchegorsk. To the south, an overflowing of the Kazachka River prompted the evacuation of over 60\u00a0people. Overall, 55\u00a0automobile accidents occurred in eastern Russia, leading to nine fatalities and 76\u00a0people injured.[46]"

JMA assigned the international number of 0913 and the name Mujigae to the storm.[7] However, at that time, Mujigae's low-level circulation center was partially exposed with convection confined to the western portion of the low-level circulation center due to a moderate amount of vertical wind shear associated with an anticyclone to the northeast of Mujigae. This affected the system which prevented Mujigae from further intensifying.[8][9] Mujigae then made landfall early the next day and passed over Northern Hainan Island with observations from Meilan, Hainan, showing that Mujigae was a 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) Tropical depression.[10] However, the JMA did not downgrade Mujigae to a tropical depression at this time.[11] As Mujigae moved into the Gulf of Tonkin, the low-level circulation center became less organized with the JTWC forecasting that Mujigae would dissipate within six hours of making landfall on Vietnam.[12] Mujigae then made landfall on Vietnam early on 12 September.[13] The JTWC then issued their last advisory with the JMA downgrading Mujigae to a tropical depression and their final advisory as Mujigae's remnants had dissipated.[13][14][15]"

The depression enhanced the southwest monsoon that brought torrential rains to the area. In Laguna, two children were killed due to landslides caused by torrential rains brought by Maring. Late on 8 September, both the JMA and the PAGASA declared the system was a minor tropical depression. On 9 September, all classes in Manila were suspended due to incessant rain and flooding. The National Disaster Coordinating Council reported that at least three villages in Malabon were submerged in 18\u00a0inch deep floodwaters. At least four streets in the area were impassable for light vehicles. Six provinces were given Public Storm Signal Number One.[18] In Valenzuela City, 15 low-lying barangays located in the city's first district were submerged. In Bulacan, five towns and two cities were flooded with water levels reaching four feet. In Bataan, the town of Dinalupihan was placed under the state of calamity after 22 barangays were affected by flash floods. In Pampanga, the NDCC placed the towns of Santa Ana, San Luis, Minalin, Mexico, Macabebe, Masantol, Apalit, Guagua, Sasmuan, Lubao, and Bacolor in state of calamity due to swelling rivers in Tarlac.

Tracking westward, the disturbance initially was slow to develop, although on September 30, the system was classified as a tropical depression. Following an improvement of its convective structure and an increase in associated convection, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Hattie on October 1. Following the development of an eye, Hattie attained typhoon intensity on October 2. The typhoon continued to slowly deepen as its forward speed slowed. Despite a decrease in cloud top temperatures around the eye, Hattie was estimated to have attained peak intensity on October 5. After recurving to the north and then northeast, Hattie began to slowly weaken due to increased wind shear. On October 7, Hattie lost typhoon intensity, and after tracking directly over Tokyo, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the next day. Although the inner core of Typhoon Hattie stayed offshore Japan, torrential rains were accountable for 68 landslides through the country. A total of 1,100 homes were flooded. Three people were killed, one was reported missing and nineteen others were injured, including six in Kyoto. Elsewhere, power lines were downed in 1,035 spots in Okinawa, mostly from sugar cane, vegetables, and flowers. Nationwide, damage was estimated at $9.9 million (1990 USD)."

        "content": "While Typhoon Gene was recurving just offshore Japan, an area of disturbed weather first developed in the Western Pacific monsoon trough 185\u00a0km (115\u00a0mi) east of Guam.[3] At 06:00 UTC on September 28, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system.[4] Additional organization was limited by strong westerly winds aloft,[3] but early on September 30, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression.[5][nb 1] Thunderstorm activity subsequently flared up, and an hour later, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the disturbance. The development of a central dense overcast prompted the JTWC to designate the system a tropical depression. By noon on October 1, its convective structure improved and shower activity had increased.[3] Based on this, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Hattie.[7][nb 2] Tropical Storm Hattie tracked west-northwest at a steady pace. Meanwhile, Hattie began to intensify at the climatological rate of one Dvorak T-number per day due to decreased wind shear and improved upper-level outflow. Thunderstorm activity quickly consolidated around a reformed low-level circulation[3] and the JMA upgraded Hattie into a severe tropical storm on October 2.[5] Shortly thereafter, Hattie developed a small but distinct eye and based on satellite intensity estimates,[3] Hattie was upgraded into a typhoon by both agencies.[7] Later that day, the typhoon began to decelerate as it approached a break in the subtropical ridge to its north. Despite a decrease in cloud top temperatures surrounding the eye, normally a sign of weakening, increased Dvorak intensity estimates justified the JTWC raising the intensity of Hattie to 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) at 00:00 UTC on October 4, equal to a mid-grade Category\u00a02 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. According to the JTWC, this would also be Hattie's highest maximum sustained wind.[3] Twenty-four hours later, the JMA estimated that Hattie peaked in intensity, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[5] On the evening of October 5, Typhoon Hattie began to recurve to the north,[9] rounding the aforementioned ridge[3] after passing through the Ryukyu Islands.[9] The system maintained its intensity until that evening, when increasing wind shear aloft began to take toll on the cyclone. Shower and thunderstorm activity quickly decreased near the center,[3] and both the JTWC and JMA agreed that Hattie lost typhoon intensity on the morning of October 7.[7] Hattie then accelerated to the northeast, passing directly over Tokyo on October 8. After becoming devoid of all convection, the JTWC reported that Hattie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC that day.[3] The JMA followed suit at roughly the same time, though the agency continued to track Hattie for an additional 18 hours.[5]"

All schools and government offices were closed during the passage of Hattie.[9] The storm, in conjunction with Typhoon Flo and Typhoon Gene, dropped 380 to 510\u00a0mm (15 to 20\u00a0in) of precipitation over Okinawa; this rainfall provided significant drought relief that forced officials to lift water rationing. Damage to military bases on Okinawa totaled to $1.6 million.[3] Across Okinawa, power lines were downed in 1,035 spots and agricultural damage totaled to \u00a5926 million yen, mostly from sugar cane, vegetables, and flowers.[13] On the eastern end of Japan's Shikoku Island, in Tokushima Prefecture, 687 homes were damaged and an additional 121 houses were destroyed.[14] There, three people were killed and 14 were wounded as the bus they were riding in was struck by a landslide.[3] A block wall of a house collapsed in Nakamura, injuring one person. Throughout K\u014dchi Prefecture, 81 homes were damaged. Damage in the prefecture amounted to \u00a5279 million yen.[15]  Heavy rains in Miyazaki Prefecture triggered 11 landslides.

In Oita Prefecture, there were 10 landslides and roads were damaged in 15 locations. One person was also rendered missing.[19] On the entire island of Kyushu, 136 flights and many ferry services were cancelled.[9] On the Kii Peninsula, around 3,400 customers lost power in Shirahama, Susami, and Hikawagawa.[20] Nine homes suffered damage in Osaka prefecture.[21] Three people were hurt in the city of Shizuoka after a tree fell on a train.[22] In Kyoto, six train passengers were injured by flying glass when the typhoon's powerful winds toppled trees onto their coach.[1] Across Mie Prefecture, sixteen dwellings were damaged and three more were flattened.[23] Heavy rain associated with Hattie led to 68 landslides through the country. Extensive flooding affected 1,100 houses. Three people were killed, one was reported missing, and 19 others were injured.[9] Damage was estimated at $9.9 million.[9][13][15][nb 3][nb 4]"

In early April, however, the rains came to an abrupt halt, and the ensuing drought lasted until July.[2]  These months of continuing dry conditions saw the drought index rise to 700 (out of 800), indicating wildfire potential similar to that usually found in western states.[1] Exacerbating the wildfire risk was the fact that development in Florida had proceeded with many new communities being built on former rural, wooded properties, often with heavy vegetation within feet of structures, and without municipal water systems and fire hydrants.[1]"

What rain came with the thunderstorms was inadequate to prevent or stop the fires.[1]  In late May and early June, numerous separate fires were igniting in Brevard, Osceola, Orange, Seminole, St. John's, Flagler, and Volusia counties, near the communities of Flagler Estates, Daytona Beach, and Palm Coast.[3]  The Big Bend region also experienced major fires in the Apalachicola and Osceola National Forests.[2] With dry conditions persisting and alarm over the fires growing, on June 7, Governor Lawton Chiles declared a state of emergency.[2] By mid-June, fires burning near I-95 forced its closure in the area. During the middle two weeks of June, each day saw the fires grow larger and everyday life more interrupted, and on June 25, in consideration of the upcoming Independence Day celebration, the Governor declared all sales and possession of fireworks illegal.[4]  Friday and Saturday, June 26 and 27 saw some abatement of conditions with the arrival of rain, and Monday the 28th, Federal agencies brought in firefighting resources including helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.  By July 1, however, increasing winds once again worsened conditions,[4] and the firebreak of I-95 was soon jumped as embers were blown eastward from fires burning in woodlands west of the interstate.[2] By July 4, 135 miles of I-95 from Jacksonville to Titusville was closed,[4] and Division of Forestry models indicated that several fires could merge into one conflagration stretching from Daytona to St. Augustine.[3] The entire population of Flagler County, some 35,000 residents, was ordered to evacuate.[5] The Pepsi 400, usually held at Daytona International Speedway on the Fourth of July weekend, was postponed.[6] That was the day that news media, learning that firefighters were short of bandanas used as protective face covers, sent out the call for as many bananas as could be supplied, and firefighters were inundated with truckloads of the fruit.[4]  On July 5, the tide finally turned as rains and humidity increased.  By mid-July, with most fires under control, over 2000 individual wildfires had burned in Florida, destroying nearly 500,000 acres, 150 structures, and 86 vehicles.[1]"

Similarly, there were many people in Massachusetts without power for up to two weeks, raising many questions about the slow response of some utility companies.[19] Several weeks after the New England storm, a similar ice storm struck the Midwestern United States, knocking out power to a million people and leading to at least 38 deaths.[20]"

Authorities evacuated several villages and towns. According to BBC News, Greece experienced the worst heatwave since 1987.[6][7] These fires were the worst fires in Greece since the 2007 Greek forest fires which burnt more than double the area (270,000 hectares) of the 2021 fires (125,000 hectares). The largest wildfires were in Attica, Olympia, Messenia, and the most destructive in northern Euboea[8][9][10][11] from which ferries evacuated about 2000 people.[6] In 2021, approximately 125,000 hectares of forest and arable land were burnt during the worst fire season since 2007, with over 50,000 hectares burnt in northern Euboea alone.[6][12] The World Meteorological Organization connected the fires with the regional heatwave and wildfire season made worse by climate change.[13][14] A fire had also broken out in the island of Rhodes a few days before the mass outbreak and resulted in a mass evacuation as well as leaving many people without power or water. Although many farms were destroyed, there were no casualties or burned homes.[15] Several wildfires were also reported in multiple parts of the island of Crete."

He confessed to police of starting 9 devastating fires in the Phthiotis region, however police suspect him of starting a total of 14. He travelled from location to location starting these fires on his bicycle from 5 August to 17 August.[23] In 2007, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report said that \"Warmer, drier conditions will lead to more frequent and prolonged droughts, as well as to a longer fire season and increased fire risk, particularly in the Mediterranean region.\"[24] The fires were some of several extreme weather events around the world in 2021."

        "content": "Typhoon Thad originated from an active monsoon trough several hundred miles east of the Philippines in mid-August\u00a01981. On August\u00a010, a weak surface circulation was first noted on satellite imagery. At that time, the center was embedded within the monsoon trough. Within five days, the system developed outflow.[1] Midday on August\u00a015, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first classified the system.[2][nb 1] Based on data from Hurricane Hunters, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015. Situated south of a subtropical ridge, the cyclone was located within a favorable environment for further development.[1] Early on August\u00a016, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm.[4][nb 2] Following an increase in organization, the JTWC upgraded the system into Tropical Depression 15 that day.[1] Initially, the depression was expected by the JTWC to move north before accelerating towards the northwest. On August\u00a017, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm. At this time, the agency anticipated Thad to re-curve well east of Japan. By 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018, the JTWC upgraded Thad to typhoon status as the cyclone developed a ragged eye.[1] Six hours later, the JMA followed suit. During the evening of August\u00a018, the agency estimated that Thad reached its peak intensity of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg).[2] Early the next day, the JTWC estimated peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). According to the JMA, Thad would maintain its peak wind speed until August\u00a021, when the storm weakened slightly.[2] However, the JTWC suggested that Thad began to deteriorate on August\u00a020. The next day, forecasts from the JTWC indicated that the typhoon was expected to re-curve and accelerate due to a trough located south of Japan. However, since the trough moved into the Sea of Japan instead, a subtropical ridge developed east of Typhoon Thad. On August\u00a022, however, Thad accelerated northward in the general direction of Japan. At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023, the JTWC downgraded Thad into a tropical storm while moving onshore in central Japan.[1] Several hours later, the JMA followed suit, even though Thad had moved well inland by that time.[2] By this time, cooler air had taken toll on the storm,[1] and that afternoon, data from both agencies indicated that Thad finished its transition into an extratropical cyclone.[4] By that time, Thad merged with a trough over the Tatar Strait.[1] However, the JMA continued monitoring the system until the morning of August\u00a025.[2]"

Four flights were also cancelled;[12] however, by August\u00a024, air traffic had returned to normal.[14] Along the Kanto Plain near Tokyo, Thad wrecked 22\u00a0houses, damaged 31 bridges, damaged roads in 145\u00a0places, and flooded 27\u00a0rivers.[12] According to police reports, five individuals drowned and six others were initially reported missing in Suzaka, because of flooding from the nearby Ayu River that crushed houses along the bank. In Akita, a fishing boat with nine people aboard was capsized by strong winds; all nine were rendered as missing by police.[7] Elsewhere, one person was killed by a falling tree and a fisherman drowned when his boat overturned.[6] In the Ibaraki Province, just north of Tokyo, officials ordered the evacuation of 5,000\u00a0dwellings in the city of Ryugasaki,[12] 2,500 of which were flooded.[14] After the nearby Kogai River threatened to overflow their banks, over 1,000\u00a0families were evacuated.[9] Another 4,000\u00a0families were evacuated in Fujishiro,[15] though by August\u00a025, the majority of the evacuated had returned to their homes.[10] In the island of Hokkaido, air service was suspended; damage was severe in the area.[16] However, the capital city of Tokyo avoided the worst of the storm.[6] In all, Thad was considered the worst storm to strike the nation in two years.[17]"

It is remembered not for its minor damage, but for its haunting pictures which became the subject of worldwide press attention. The tornado was captured by an elevated camera operated by the local television station WPLG.[2] The tornado formed at 1:53\u00a0p.m. EDT, initially touching down in the Silver Bluff Estates area.[3] It then swept through Downtown Miami bypassing the city's skyscrapers. It crossed the MacArthur Causeway and the Venetian Causeway towards Miami Beach, sideswiping the cruise ship MS Sovereign of the Seas. The tornado lifted from the water halfway through Biscayne Bay and touched down briefly again in Miami Beach, flipping over a car and then dissipating. The Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma had noted the possibility for tornadoes in the area and warned that there might be more to come. The tornado ultimately caused 12\u00a0injuries and $525,000 in damage,[4] though no injuries were serious.[5] The tornado's passage also cut power to 21,000\u00a0people.[5] While hurricanes are often seen as the biggest weather threat to Miami, tornadoes are relatively common in South Florida, although the vast majority of the ones that strike Miami-Dade County are small, relatively weak F0 or F1 tornadoes. Most of these tornadoes form as either waterspouts off Biscayne Bay, as part of the frequent afternoon thunderstorms, or spawned from a tropical storm or hurricane."

        "content": " The St. Francis Dam, or the San Francisquito Dam, was a concrete gravity dam located in San Francisquito Canyon in northern Los Angeles County, California, United States, that was built between 1924 and 1926. The dam failed catastrophically in 1928, killing at least 431 people in the subsequent flood,[2][3] in what is considered to have been one of the worst American civil engineering disasters of the 20th century and the third-greatest loss of life in California history.[4][5][6] The dam was built to serve the growing water needs of the city of Los Angeles, creating a large regulating and storage reservoir that was an integral part of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. It was located in San Francisquito Canyon of the Sierra Pelona Mountains, about 40 miles (64\u00a0km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and approximately 10 miles (16\u00a0km) north of the present day city of Santa Clarita. However, a defective soil foundation and design flaws led to the dam's collapse just two years after its completion. Its failure ended the career of William Mulholland, the general manager and chief engineer of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply (now the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power).[7]"

        "content": "In the early years of Los Angeles, the city's water supply was obtained from the Los Angeles River. This was accomplished by diverting water from the river through a series of ditches called zanjas. At that time, a private water company, the Los Angeles City Water Company, leased the city's waterworks and provided water to the city. Hired in 1878 as a zanjero (ditch tender), William Mulholland proved to be a brilliant employee who, after doing his day's work, would study textbooks on mathematics, hydraulics and geology, thereby teaching himself geology and engineering. Mulholland quickly moved up the ranks of the Water Company and was promoted to superintendent in 1886.[8] In 1902, the City of Los Angeles ended its lease with the Water Company and took control over the city's water supply. The Los Angeles City Council established the Water Department \u2013 renamed the Bureau of Water Works and Supply in 1911 \u2013 with Mulholland as its superintendent. Mulholland was concurrently named as the Bureau's chief engineer following the organization's name change.[8][9] Mulholland achieved great recognition among members of the engineering community when he supervised the design and construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which at the time was the longest aqueduct in the world. It used gravity alone to bring the water 233 miles (375\u00a0km) from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles.[10] The project was completed in 1913, on time and under budget, despite several setbacks. Excluding incidents of sabotage by Owens Valley residents in the early years, the aqueduct has continued to operate well throughout its history and remains in operation today.[11]"

        "header": "Planning and design",
        "content": "It was during the process of building the aqueduct that Mulholland first considered sections of San Francisquito Canyon as a potential dam site. He felt that there should be a reservoir of sufficient size to provide water for Los Angeles for an extended period in the event of a drought or if the aqueduct were damaged by an earthquake.[12] In particular, he favored the area between where the hydroelectric power plants Powerhouses No. 1 and No. 2 were to be built, with what he perceived as favorable topography, a natural narrowing of the canyon downstream of a wide, upstream platform which would allow the creation of a large reservoir area with a minimum possible dam.[13] A large camp had been set up to house the workers near this area, and Mulholland used his spare time becoming familiar with the area's geological features. In the area where the dam would later be situated, Mulholland found the mid- and upper portion of the western hillside consisted mainly of a reddish-colored conglomerate and sandstone formation that had small veins of gypsum interspersed within it. Below the red conglomerate, down the remaining portion of the western hillside, crossing the canyon floor and up the eastern wall, a drastically different rock composition prevailed. These areas were made up of mica schist that was severely laminated, cross-faulted in many areas, and interspersed with talc. Later, although many geologists disagreed on the exact location of the area of contact between the two formations, a majority opinion placed it at the inactive San Francisquito Fault line. Mulholland ordered exploratory tunnels and shafts excavated into the red conglomerate hillside to determine its characteristics and had water percolation tests performed. The results convinced him that the hill would make a satisfactory abutment for a dam should the need ever arise.[14] A surprising aspect of the early geologic exploration came later, when the need for a dam arose. Although Mulholland wrote of the unstable nature of the face of schist on the eastern side of the canyon in his annual report to the Board of Public Works in 1911,[15] this fact was either misjudged or ignored by Stanley Dunham, the construction supervisor of the St. Francis Dam. Dunham testified, at the coroner's inquest, that tests which he had ordered yielded results which showed the rock to be hard and of the same nature throughout the entire area which became the eastern abutment. His opinion was that this area was more than suitable for construction of the dam.[16] The population of Los Angeles was increasing rapidly. In 1900 the population was slightly over 100,000. By 1910, it had become more than three times that number at 320,000, and by 1920 the figure reached 576,673.[17] This unexpectedly rapid growth brought a demand for a larger water supply. Between 1920 and 1926, seven smaller reservoirs were built and modifications were made to raise the height of the water bureau's largest of the time, the Lower San Fernando reservoir, by seven feet, but the need for a still-larger reservoir was clear. Originally, the planned site of this new large reservoir was to be in Big Tujunga Canyon, above the community now known as Sunland, in the northeast portion of the San Fernando Valley, but the high asking prices of the ranches and private land which had to be acquired were, in Mulholland's view, an attempted hold-up of the city. He ceased attempts at purchasing those lands and, either forgetful of or disregarding his earlier acknowledgement of geological problems at the site,[18] renewed his interest in the area he had explored twelve years earlier, the federally owned and far less expensive private land in San Francisquito Canyon.[13][19]"

        "header": "Construction and modification",
        "content": "The process of surveying the area and determining the location for the St. Francis Dam began in December 1922. Clearing of the site and construction began without any of the usual fanfare for a municipal project of this nature. The Los Angeles Aqueduct had become the target of frequent sabotage by angry farmers and landowners in the Owens Valley and the city was eager to avoid any repeat of these expensive and time-consuming repairs. The St. Francis Dam, sometimes referred to as the San Francisquito Dam, was only the second concrete dam to be designed and built by the Bureau of Water Works and Supply. The first was the nearly dimensionally-identical Mulholland Dam, on which construction had begun one year earlier. The design of the St. Francis Dam was in fact an adaptation of the Mulholland Dam, with modifications made so as to suit the site. Most of the design profiles and computation figures of stress factors for the St. Francis Dam came from this adaptation of the plans and formulas which had been used in the constructing of the Mulholland Dam. This work was done by the engineering department within the Bureau of Water Works and Supply.[20][21] In describing the shape and type of the St. Francis Dam, the word curved is used although, by today's standards, due to the amount of curve in its radius, the dam would be considered arched, therefore making it of the arch-gravity design. It was not so called because the science of arch-gravity dams was still in its infancy. Little was known in the engineering community about the arch effect, how it worked and how loads were transmitted, other than that it did help with stability and support. As such, the dam was designed without any of the additional benefits given by the arch action, which led to its profile being considered conservative, given its size.[22][23] Annually, as did most other city entities, the Bureau of Water Works and Supply and the ancillary departments reported to the Board of Public Service Commissioners on the prior fiscal year's activities. From these we know that the preliminary studies of the area which became the site of the St. Francis Dam, and topographical surveys for the dam, were completed by June 1923. They called for a dam built to the elevation of 1,825\u00a0ft (556\u00a0m) above sea level, which is 175\u00a0ft (53\u00a0m) above the stream bed base. These early calculations for a reservoir created by the dam revealed it would have a capacity of approximately 30,000\u00a0acre\u22c5ft (37,000,000\u00a0m3).[24][25] On July 1, 1924, the same day Mulholland was to submit his annual report to the Board of Public Service Commissioners, Office Engineer W. W. Hurlbut informed him that all of the preliminary work on the dam had been completed. In his report presented to the Board, Mulholland wrote that the capacity of the reservoir would be 32,000 acre-feet (39,000,000 m3). Hurlbut, who also presented the Board with his annual report, Report of the Office Engineer, gave a clarification for this change from the prior year's estimate. In his report he wrote that: ...at the St. Francis Reservoir the dam site has been cleared and the foundation trench started. All concrete placing equipment has been contracted for and it is expected actual work of pouring the concrete will start in approximately ninety days. Additional topographic surveys have been completed and disclose a storage capacity of 32,000 acre feet at elevation 1825 feet above sea level. Construction of the dam itself began five weeks later, in early August, when the first concrete was poured.[26][27] In March 1925, prior to Mulholland's report to the Board of Public Service Commissioners, Hurlbut again reported to Mulholland on the progress of the St. Francis project. He stated the reservoir would now have a capacity of 38,000 acre-feet (47,000,000 m3) and that the dam's height would be 185 feet (56\u00a0m) above stream bed level. Hurlbut wrote, in an explanation of these changes that was presented to the Board of Public Service Commissioners, that: Additional surveys and changes in the plans for this reservoir have disclosed the fact that at crest elevation of 1835 feet above sea level the reservoir will have a capacity of 38,000 acre-feet.[28][29] This 10-foot (3.0\u00a0m) increase in the dam's height over the original plan of 1923 necessitated the construction of a 588-foot (179\u00a0m) long wing dike along the top of the ridge adjacent to the western abutment in order to contain the enlarged reservoir.[30] A distinctive aspect of the St. Francis Dam was its stepped downstream face. While the height of each step was a constant 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m), the width of each step was unique to its respective elevation above sea level. This width varied between 5.5 feet (1.7\u00a0m) near the stream bed base at 1,650 feet (500\u00a0m) and decreased to 1.45 feet (0.44\u00a0m) at an elevation of 1,816 feet (554\u00a0m), the base of the spillways and upright panels.[31] When completed on May 4, 1926, the stairstep-faced dam rose to a height of 185 feet above the canyon floor. Both faces leading up to the crest were vertical for the final 23 feet (7.0\u00a0m). On the downstream face, this vertical section was fashioned into 24 feet (7.3\u00a0m) wide sections. A portion of these made up the spillway, which consisted of eleven panels in total divided into two groups. Each spillway section had an open area that was 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) high and 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) wide for the overflow to pass. The dam also had five 30-inch (76\u00a0cm) diameter outlet pipes through the center section which were controlled by slide gates attached to the upstream face."

        "content": "Water began to fill the reservoir on March 12, 1926.[32] It rose steadily and rather uneventfully, although several temperature and contraction cracks did appear in the dam, and a minor amount of seepage began to flow from under the abutments. In accord with the protocol for design, which had been established by the Engineering department during construction of the Mulholland Dam, no contraction joints were incorporated.[33] The most notable incidents were two vertical cracks that ran down through the dam from the top; one was approximately 58 feet (18\u00a0m) west of the outlet gates and another about the same distance to the east. Mulholland, along with his Assistant Chief Engineer and General Manager Harvey Van Norman, inspected the cracks and judged them to be within expectation for a concrete dam the size of the St. Francis. At the beginning of April, the water level reached the area of the inactive San Francisquito Fault line in the western abutment. Some seepage began almost immediately as the water covered this area. Workers were ordered to seal off the leak, but they were not entirely successful, and water continued to permeate through the face of the dam. A two-inch pipe was used to collect this seepage and was laid from the fault line down to the home of the dam keeper, Tony Harnischfeger, which he used for domestic purposes. Water that collected in the drainage pipes under the dam to relieve the hydrostatic uplift pressure was carried off in this manner as well.[34] In April 1927 the reservoir level was brought to within 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) of the spillway, and during most of May the water level was within 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) of overflowing. There were no large changes in the amount of the seepage that was collected and, month after month, the pipe flowed about one-third full. This was an insignificant amount for a dam the size of the St. Francis, and on this subject Mulholland said, \"Of all the dams I have built and of all the dams I have ever seen, it was the driest dam of its size I ever saw.\" The seepage data recorded during the 1926\u20131927 period shows that the dam was an exceptionally dry structure.[34] On May 27, 1927, the problems in the Owens Valley escalated once again with the dynamiting of a large section of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, part of the California Water Wars. A second incident took place a few days later, destroying another large section. In the days that followed, several more sections of the aqueduct were dynamited which caused a complete disruption of the flow. The near-full reservoir behind the St. Francis Dam was the only source of water from the north and withdrawals began immediately.[35] During this time, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department received an anonymous phone call that a carload of men were on their way from Inyo County with the intention of dynamiting the dam and \"to get some officers on the way as quick as possible.\"[36][35] Within minutes, all personnel of the Bureau of Power and Light and the Bureau of Water Works and Supply either working or residing within the canyon had been notified. Cars carrying dozens of officers from both the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff's Departments rushed to the area. Although no sign of the threat that brought all this about materialized, for many days after, the canyon resembled an armed encampment.[35] The Daily Record of High Water Elevations of the St. Francis Dam shows that between May 27 and June 30 alone, 7000 to 8000 acre-feet of water was withdrawn. Through June and July the Owens Valley fight continued, as did interruptions in the flow from the aqueduct. This in turn caused continued withdrawals from the reservoir.[35] In early August, opposition to Los Angeles's water projects collapsed after the indictment of its leaders for embezzlement. The city subsequently sponsored a series of repair and maintenance programs for aqueduct facilities that stimulated local employment.[37][38] The St. Francis reservoir level rose once again, although not without incident. Late in 1927, a fracture was noticed which began at the western abutment and ran diagonally upwards and toward the center section for a distance. As with others, Mulholland inspected the fracture, judged it to be another contraction crack and ordered it filled with oakum and grouted to seal off any seepage. At the same time, another fracture appeared in a corresponding position on the eastern portion of the dam, starting at the crest near the last spillway section and running downward at an angle for sixty-five feet before ending at the hillside. It too was sealed in the same manner. Both of these fractures were noted to be wider at their junction with the hillside abutments and narrowed as they angled toward the top of the dam.[39] The reservoir continued to rise steadily until early February 1928, when the water level was brought to within one foot of the spillway. During this time though, several new cracks appeared in the wing dike, and new areas of seepage began from under both abutments.[40] Near the end of February, a notable leak began at the base of the wing dike approximately 150 feet (46\u00a0m) west of the main dam, discharging about 0.60 cubic feet per second (4.5 U.S. gallons, or 17 liters, per second). The fracture was inspected by Mulholland, who judged it to be another contraction or temperature crack and left it open to drain. During the first week of March, it was noticed that the leak had approximately doubled. Due in part to some erosion taking place, Mulholland ordered an eight-inch (20.3\u00a0cm) concrete drain pipe to be installed. The pipe led the water along the dike wall, discharging it at the west abutment contact with the main dam.[41] This gave the hillside a very saturated appearance, and the water flowing down the steps of the dam where it abutted the hill caused alarm among the canyon residents and others traveling on the road 700 feet (210\u00a0m) to the east, as at that distance it appeared the water was coming from the abutment. On March 7, 1928, the reservoir was three inches below the spillway crest and Mulholland ordered that no more water be turned into the St. Francis Dam.[42] Five days later, while conducting his morning rounds, Harnischfeger discovered a new leak in the west abutment. Concerned not only because other leaks had appeared in this same area in the past but more so that the muddy color of the runoff he observed could indicate the water was eroding the foundation of the dam, he immediately alerted Mulholland. After arriving, both Mulholland and Van Norman began inspecting the area of the leak. Van Norman found the source and by following the runoff, determined that the muddy appearance of the water was not from the leak itself but came from where the water contacted loose soil from a newly cut access road. The leak was discharging 2 to 3 cubic feet (15 to 22\u00a0US\u00a0gal; 57 to 85\u00a0L) per second of water by their approximation. Mulholland and Van Norman's concern was heightened not only by the leak's location but by the inconsistent volume of the discharge, according to their testimony at the coroner's inquest. On two occasions as they watched, an acceleration or surging of the flow was noticed by both men.[43][44] Mulholland felt that some corrective measures were needed, although this could be done at some time in the future.[45] For the next two hours Mulholland, Van Norman and Harnischfeger inspected the dam and various leaks and seepages, finding nothing out of the ordinary or of concern for a large dam. With both Mulholland and Van Norman convinced that the new leak was not dangerous and that the dam was safe, they returned to Los Angeles.[45][46]"

        "header": "Collapse and flood wave",
        "content": "Two and a half minutes before midnight on March 12, 1928, the St. Francis Dam catastrophically failed. There were no surviving eyewitnesses to the collapse, but at least five people passed the dam less than an hour before without noticing anything unusual. The last,[47][48] Ace Hopewell, a carpenter at Powerhouse No. 1, rode his motorcycle past the dam about ten minutes before midnight. At the coroner's inquest, Hopewell testified he had passed Powerhouse No. 2 without seeing anything there or at the dam that caused him concern. He stated at approximately one and one-half miles (2.4\u00a0km) upstream he heard, above his motorcycle's engine noise, a rumbling much like the sound of \"rocks rolling on the hill.\" Hopewell stopped, got off his motorcycle and smoked a cigarette while checking the hillsides. The rumbling had begun to fade, and Hopewell assumed the sound was a landslide common to the area. Hopewell finished his cigarette, got back on his motorcycle and left. He was the last person to see the St. Francis Dam intact and survive. At both of the Bureau of Power and Light's receiving stations in Los Angeles and at the Bureau of Water Works and Supply at Powerhouse No. 1, there was a sharp voltage drop at 11:57:30 p.m.[49] Simultaneously, a transformer at Southern California Edison's (SCE) Saugus substation exploded, a situation investigators later determined was caused by wires up the western hillside of San Francisquito Canyon about ninety feet above the dam's east abutment shorting.[50][31] Given the known height of the flood wave, and the fact that within seventy minutes or less after the collapse the reservoir was virtually empty, the failure must have been sudden and complete. Seconds after it began, little of the dam remained standing, other than the center section and wing wall. The main dam, from west of the center section to the wing wall abutment atop the hillside, broke into several large pieces and numerous smaller pieces. All of these were washed downstream as 12.4 billion gallons (47 million m\u00b3) of water began surging down San Francisquito Canyon. The largest piece, weighing approximately 10,000 tons (9,000 metric tons) was found about three-quarters of a mile (1.2\u00a0km) below the dam site.[51] Somewhat similarly, the dam portion east of the center section had also broken into several larger and smaller pieces. Unlike the western side, most of these came to rest near the base of the standing section. The largest fragments fell across the lower portion of the standing section, coming to rest partially on its upstream face. Initially, the two remaining sections of the dam remained upright. As the reservoir lowered, water undercut the already undermined eastern portion, which twisted and fell backwards toward the eastern hillside, breaking into three sections.[51] Harnischfeger and his family were most likely among the first casualties caught in the initial 140 feet (43\u00a0m) high flood wave, which swept over their cottage about one-quarter mile (400\u00a0m) downstream from the dam. The body of a woman who lived with the family was found fully clothed and wedged between two blocks of concrete near the base of the dam. This led to the suggestion she and Harnischfeger may have been inspecting the structure immediately before its failure. Neither Harnischfeger's body nor that of his six-year-old son were found.[52] Five minutes after the collapse, the then 120-foot-high (37\u00a0m) flood wave had traveled one and one-half miles (2.4 km) at an average speed of 18 miles per hour (29\u00a0km/h), destroying Powerhouse No. 2 and taking the lives of 64 of the 67 workmen and their families who lived nearby. This cut power to much of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. Power was quickly restored via tie-lines with SCE, but as the floodwater entered the Santa Clara riverbed it overflowed the river's banks, flooding parts of present-day Valencia and Newhall. At about 12:40 a.m. SCE's two main lines into the city were destroyed by the flooding, re-darkening the areas that had earlier lost power and spreading the outage to other areas served by SCE. Nonetheless, power to most of the areas not flooded was restored with power from SCE's Long Beach steam electric generating plant.[53] Near 1:00 a.m. the mass of water, then 55\u00a0ft (17\u00a0m) high,[54] followed the river bed west and demolished SCE's Saugus substation, cutting power to the entire Santa Clara River Valley and parts of Ventura and Oxnard. At least four miles of the state's main north\u2013south highway was under water and the town of Castaic Junction was being washed away.[55] The flood entered the Santa Clarita River Valley at 12\u00a0mph (19\u00a0km/h). Approximately five miles downstream, near the Ventura\u2013Los Angeles county line, a temporary construction camp SCE had set up for its 150-man crew on the flats of the riverbank was hit. In the confusion, SCE personnel had been unable to issue a warning and 84 workers perished.[56] Shortly before 1:30 a.m., a Santa Clara River Valley telephone operator learned from the Pacific Long Distance Telephone Company that the St. Francis Dam had failed. She called a motorcycle officer with the State Motor Division,[57] then began calling the homes of those in danger. The officer went door-to-door warning residents about the imminent flood.[58][59] At the same time, a deputy sheriff drove up the valley, toward the flood, with his siren blaring, until he had to stop at Fillmore.[48] The flood heavily damaged the towns of Fillmore, Bardsdale and Santa Paula before emptying both victims and debris into the Pacific Ocean 54 miles (87\u00a0km) downstream south of Ventura, at what is now the West Montalvo Oil Field, around 5:30 a.m., at which point the wave was almost two miles (3 km) wide and still traveling at 6\u00a0mph (9.7\u00a0km/h). Newspapers across the country carried accounts of the disaster. The front page of the Los Angeles Times ran four stories, including aerial photos of the collapsed dam and the ruins of Santa Paula. In a statement, Mulholland said, \"I would not venture at this time to express a positive opinion as to the cause of the St. Francis Dam disaster... Mr. Van Norman and I arrived at the scene of the break around 2:30\u00a0a.m. this morning. We saw at once that the dam was completely out and that the torrential flood of water from the reservoir had left an appalling record of death and destruction in the valley below.\"[60] Mulholland stated that it appeared that there had been major movement in the hills forming the western buttress of the dam, adding that three eminent geologists, Robert T. Hill, C. F. Tolman and D.W. Murphy, had been hired by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners to determine if this was the cause."

      {
        "header": "Investigation",
        "content": "There were at least a dozen investigations into the disaster. With unprecedented speed, eight of these had begun by the weekend following the collapse. Almost all involved investigative panels of prominent engineers and geologists. The more notable of these groups and committees were those sponsored by Governor C. C. Young, headed by A. J. Wiley, the renowned dam engineer and consultant to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Boulder (Hoover) Dam Board; the Los Angeles City Council, which was chaired by the Chief of the Reclamation Service, Elwood Mead; Los Angeles County Coroner Frank Nance, and Los Angeles County District Attorney Asa Keyes. Others were convened: the Water and Power Commissioners started their own inquiry, as did the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, who hired J. B. Lippincott. The Santa Clara River Protective Association employed the geologist and Stanford University professor emeritus, Dr. Bailey Willis, and eminent San Francisco civil engineer and past president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Carl E. Grunsky. There were still others, such as the state railroad commission and several political entities who only sent investigators or representatives.[61] Although they were not unanimous on all points, most commissions quickly reached their conclusions. The governor's commission met on March 19 and submitted their 79-page report to the governor on March 24, only eleven days after the collapse. Although this may have been sufficient time to answer what they had been directed to determine, they had been deprived of the sworn testimony at the coroner's inquest, which was scheduled to be convened March 21, the only inquiry that took into consideration factors other than geology and engineering.[62] The need for immediate answers was understandable, having its roots in the Swing\u2013Johnson Bill in Congress. This bill, which had first been filed in 1922, and failed to be voted on in three successive Congresses, was again before Congress at the time. This bill ultimately provided the funding for constructing the Hoover Dam. Supporters and responsible leaders alike realized the jeopardy in which the bill stood. Although the water and electricity from the project were needed, the idea of the construction of such a massive dam of similar design, which would create a reservoir seven hundred times larger than the St. Francis, did not sit well with many in light of the recent disaster and the devastation.[63] The bill was passed by Congress and signed into law by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge on December 21, 1928.[64][65] The governor's commission was the first to release its findings, titled Report of the Commission appointed by Governor C. C. Young to investigate the causes leading to the failure of the St. Francis dam near Saugus, California. The report became the most widely distributed analysis. Along with most of the other investigators, they perceived the new leak as the key to understanding the collapse, although the commission believed that \"the foundation under the entire dam left very much to be desired.\" The report stated, \"With such a formation, the ultimate failure of this dam was inevitable, unless water could have been kept from reaching the foundation. Inspection galleries, pressure grouting, drainage wells and deep cut-off walls are commonly used to prevent or remove percolation, but it is improbable that any or all of these devices would have been adequately effective, though they would have ameliorated the conditions and postponed the final failure.\"[66] They placed the cause of the failure on the western hillside. \"The west end,\" the commission stated, \"was founded upon a reddish conglomerate which, even when dry, was of decidedly inferior strength and which, when wet, became so soft that most of it lost almost all rock characteristics.\" The softening of the \"reddish conglomerate\" undermined the west side. \"The rush of water released by failure of the west end caused a heavy scour against the easterly canyon wall ... and caused the failure of that part of the structure.\" There then \"quickly followed ... the collapse of large sections of the dam.\"[67] The committee appointed by the Los Angeles City Council for the most part concurred in attributing the collapse to \"defective foundations\", and wrote, \"The manner of failure was that the first leak, however started, began under the concrete at that part of the dam which stood on the red conglomerate; this leak increased in volume as it scoured away the foundation material already greatly softened by infiltrated water from the reservoir which removed the support of the dam at this point and since no arch action could occur by reason of the yielding conglomerate abutment, made failure of the dam inevitable.\" Likewise, they concluded the failure most likely followed a pattern similar to that which was proposed by the governor's commission, although they did acknowledge that \"the sequence of failure is uncertain.\"[68] The committee ended their report with, \"...having examined all the evidence which it has been able to obtain to date reports its conclusions as follows: The consensus of most of the investigating commissions was that the initial break had taken place at or near the fault line on the western abutment, which had been a problem area since water first covered the area. The prevailing thought was that increasing water percolation through the fault line had either undermined or weakened the foundation to a point that a portion of the structure blew out or the dam collapsed from its own immense weight. This was supported by a chart made by the automatic water level recorder located on the dam's center section. This chart clearly showed that there had been no significant change in the reservoir level until forty minutes before the dam's failure, at which time a small though gradually increasing loss was recorded.[70] The only theory to vary greatly from the others was that of Willis, Grunsky and his son. They believed that the portion of the east abutment below the dam was the first to give way, clearing the way for the collapse to take place. Their investigations, while somewhat collaborative, culminated in two separate reports (one by the Grunskys and the other by Willis) which were completed in April 1928. These reports, according to Grunsky, \"were reached independently\" and \"are in substantial agreement.\"[71] Willis and the Grunskys agreed with the other engineers and investigators about the poor quality and deteriorating conditions of the entire foundation, although they maintained that a critical situation developed on the east abutment. Willis, the geologist of the investigative team, was most likely the first to discover the \"old landslide\" within the mountains which had made the eastern abutment for the dam. In his report, he discussed it at great length and the Grunskys drew substantially on it, as they did his analysis of the schist, for their own report. The Grunskys, as civil engineers, took the lead in that area of the investigation, and in describing the role played by \"hydrostatic uplift\".[71] Uplift takes its name from its tendency to lift a dam upward. Although many designers and builders of dams had become aware of this phenomenon by the late 1890s to early 1900s, it was still not generally well understood or appreciated. Nevertheless, it was becoming a matter of debate and a concern to dam builders of this era that water from a reservoir could seep under a dam and exert pressure upward. Due for the most part to inadequate drainage of the base and side abutments, the phenomenon of uplift destabilizes gravity dams by reducing the structure's \"effective weight\", making it less able to resist horizontal water pressure. Uplift can act through the bedrock foundation: the condition most commonly develops where the bedrock foundation is strong enough to bear the weight of the dam, but is fractured or fissured and therefore susceptible to seepage and water saturation.[7][67] According to their theories, water from the reservoir had permeated far back into the schist formation of the eastern abutment. This lubricated the rock and it slowly began to move, exerting a tremendous amount of weight against the dam, which according to the Grunskys was already becoming less stable due to \"uplift\". Making the situation worse, Willis established, was that the conglomerate, on which the western abutment of the dam rested, reacted upon becoming wet by swelling. In fact, the amount of swelling was such that it would raise any structure built upon it.[72]\nThis hypothesis was reinforced when surveys taken of the wing wall after the failure were compared with those taken at the time it was built. They reveal that in some areas the wall was two to six inches higher than when built.[73] Therefore, the dam was caught between forces that were acting on it much like a vise, as the red conglomerate swelled on one side, and the moving mountain pressed in on it from the other. In his report, Grunsky concluded: As soon as the dam was loosened on its base the toe of the structure spalled off. This was probably the beginning of its breaking up, and probably occurred sometime after 11:30 PM during the 23 minutes in which the water in the reservoir apparently fell 3/10 of a foot. Thereupon, quite likely, a part of the east end of the dam, meanwhile undermined, went out and the dam at this end lost its hillside support. Hydrostatic uplift at the already loose west and the weight of the remaining portion of the undermined east end caused a temporary tilting of the dam towards the east, accompanied by a rapid washing away of the hillside under the dam at its west end which then also began to break up. The reservoir water was now rushing with tremendous force against both ends and against the upstream face of all that was standing of the dam. This rush of water carried away huge blocks of concrete from both ends of the dam...[71][69] There was and remains a difference of professional opinions on the amount of time that elapsed, shown by the chart made by the Stevens automatic water level recorder, from when the line indicating the reservoir level broke sharply downward until it became perpendicular. Most investigating engineers feel the amount of time indicated on the chart is thirty to forty minutes, not the twenty-three minutes that Grunsky stated.[74] In support of his theory of the dam tilting, Grunsky pointed to an odd clue near the western lower edge of the standing section. Here a ladder had become wedged in a crack that had opened apparently during this rocking or tilting process and then had become tightly pinched in place as the section settled back on its foundation. Measurements taken proved the crack must have been much wider at the time that the ladder entered it. Further, surveys indeed showed the center section had been subjected to severe tilting or twisting. These surveys established that the center section had moved 5.5 inches (14\u00a0cm) downstream and 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) toward the eastern abutment.[71] Although this investigation was insightful and informative, the theory, along with others which hypothesized an appreciably increasing amount of seepage just prior to the failure, becomes less likely when it is compared against the eyewitness accounts of the conditions in the canyon and near the dam during the last thirty minutes before its collapse.[75] Grunsky hypothesized, though failed to explain, the action of the dam tilting as he described. This action would have the dam in motion as a single unit while conversely, testimony given at the coroner's inquest indicates that the dam was fractured transversely in at least four places. Furthermore, the two cracks, which bordered each side of the standing center section, would have served as hinges to prevent this.[76]"

        "content": "The center section of the St. Francis Dam, which had become known as \"The Tombstone\" due to a newspaper reporter's description of it as such, became an attraction for tourists and souvenir hunters.[69] It was toppled with dynamite in May 1929, and the remaining blocks were demolished with bulldozers and jackhammers to discourage exploration of the ruins by the public. The wing dike was used by Los Angeles firemen to gain experience in using explosives on building structures. The dam was not rebuilt, though Bouquet Reservoir in nearby Bouquet Canyon was built in 1934 as an early replacement, with additional capacity added with the completion of the Castaic Dam decades later in 1973.[31] The exact number of victims remains unknown. The official death toll in August 1928 was 385, but the remains of victims continued to be discovered every few years until the mid-1950s.[77] Many victims were swept out to sea when the flood reached the Pacific Ocean and were never recovered, while others were washed ashore, some as far south as the Mexican border. The remains of one victim were found deep underground near Newhall in 1992, and other bodies, believed to be victims of the disaster, were found in the late 1970s and 1994. The death toll is currently estimated to be at least 431.[78] At the coroner's inquest, the leak that Harnischfeger had spotted was cited as evidence that the dam was leaking on the day of the break, and that both Mulholland and the Bureau of Water Works and Supply were aware of it. Mulholland told the jury he had been at the dam the day of the break due to the dam keeper's call, but neither he nor Van Norman had observed anything of concern, nor found any dangerous conditions. Mulholland further testified that leaks in dams, especially of the type and size of the St. Francis, were common. During the inquest Mulholland said, \"This inquest is a very painful thing for me to have to attend but it is the occasion of it that is painful. The only ones I envy about this thing are the ones who are dead.\"[79] In subsequent testimony, after answering a question he added, \"Whether it is good or bad, don't blame anyone else, you just fasten it on me. If there was an error in human judgment, I was the human, I won't try to fasten it on anyone else.\"[80] The coroner's inquest jury determined that one of the causative factors for the disaster lay in what they had termed as \"an error in engineering judgment in determining the foundation at the St. Francis Dam site and deciding on the best type of dam to build there\" and that \"the responsibility for the error in engineering judgment rests upon the Bureau of Water Works and Supply, and the Chief Engineer thereof.\" They cleared Mulholland as well as others of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply of any criminal culpability, since neither he nor anyone else at the time could have known of the instability of the rock formations on which the dam was built. The hearings also recommended that \"the construction and operation of a great dam should never be left to the sole judgment of one man, no matter how eminent.\"[81] Mulholland retired from the Bureau of Water Works and Supply December 1, 1928.[82] His assistant, Harvey Van Norman, succeeded him as chief engineer and general manager. Mulholland was retained as Chief Consulting Engineer, with an office, and received a salary of $500 a month. In later years, he retreated into a life of semi-isolation. Mulholland died in 1935, at the age of 79.[7]"

        "content": "At present, the popular hypothesis is that collapse may have begun with the eastern abutment of the dam giving way, possibly due to a landslide. This scenario, having its roots in the works of Willis and Grunsky, was expanded upon by the author Charles Outland in his 1963 book Man\u2011Made Disaster: The Story of St. Francis Dam. The material on which the eastern abutment of the dam had been built may itself have been part of an ancient landslide, but this would have been impossible for almost any geologists of the 1920s to detect. Indeed, the site had been inspected twice, at different times, by two of the leading geologists and civil engineers of the day, Grunsky and John C. Branner of Stanford University; neither found fault with the San Francisquito rock.[87] J. David Rogers,[88] inspired by the work of Outland, investigated the failure and published an extensive scenario, albeit somewhat controversial, of the possible geological and rock mechanic actions which may have led to the dam's failure. He attributed the failure to three major factors: the instability of the ancient landslide material on which the dam was built, the failure to compensate for the additional height added to the dam's design, and the design and construction being overseen by only one person.[31] A critique of Rogers' historical analysis of the dam's collapse was published in the journal California History in 2004 by historians Norris Hundley Jr. (Professor Emeritus, UCLA) and Donald C. Jackson (Professor, Lafayette College). While accepting most of his geological analysis of the failure, the article makes clearer the differences and deficiencies of the structure built in San Francisquito Canyon and how it fell short of the standards for large-scale concrete gravity dams as practiced by other prominent dam engineers in the 1920s.[67]"

An external review panel to evaluate the structure, convened by the State of California, followed in 1930. The same year, the City of Los Angeles Board of Water & Power Commissioners appointed their own Board of Review for the dam. Although the state's panel did not recommend modification of the dam, both panels came to similar conclusions: that the dam lacked what was then considered sufficient uplift relief, which could lead to destabilization, and was unacceptable. Again in 1931, a fourth panel, the Board of Engineers to Evaluate Mulholland Dam, was appointed to assess the structure. As well, an external study group appointed by the Board of Water & Power Commissioners produced a \"Geological Report of the Suitability of Foundations\". Certain design deficiencies were uncovered in the plans made by the engineering department during the planning phase of the dam. These had to do with the dam's base width in conjunction to its ability to resist uplift and sliding and to withstand earthquake loading.[90] The decision was made to permanently keep the Hollywood Reservoir drawn down. It was also decided to keep the amount stored in the reservoir to no more than 4,000\u00a0acre\u22c5ft (4,900,000\u00a0m3) and to place an enormous amount of earth, 330,000\u00a0cu\u00a0yd (250,000\u00a0m3), on the dam's downstream face to increase its resistance against hydraulic uplift and earthquake forces, and to screen it from public view. This work was carried out in 1933\u201334.[91][92]"

Subsequently, the Chilean government declared Valpara\u00edso a disaster zone, which was later expanded to a state of constitutional exception, which allowed the Chilean Army to take control of the city, with the purpose of guarding the people's safety and maintaining public order. Several areas of the city were evacuated.[12] During the wildfire, there were at least six general power outages in the city, which occurred between 18:00 and 01:00 local time, making it more difficult to extinguish the fire. This also made it easier for thieves to loot abandoned and damaged homes as a result of the evacuation. The fire is now regarded as the most catastrophic in the city's history. President Michelle Bachelet confirmed that \"it may be the worst fire in the history of Valpara\u00edso\" and did not rule out that the number of victims and the damage estimate could increase as the ruins are inspected to determine the number of destroyed houses. She also sent \"a message of support to all those hundreds of families who lost their homes, their things, and in some cases, their loved ones\".[8] It was reported that many Valpara\u00edso residents were suffering from smoke inhalation.[13] the impoverished neighbourhoods of Mariposa and La Cruz hills were the most affected areas.[14] ONEMI reported that at least 850 hectares of vegetation (grassland, scrub and eucalyptus) were destroyed, and that twelve helicopters and three air tankers were struggling against the fire outbreaks that were still active in some hills. In total, according to the state organization, around 3,500 people from the CONAF, firefighters, police (carabineros de Chile), the army, health services and the ONEMI itself are working to combat and control the wildfire. The ONEMI has also sent trucks with mattresses, blankets, water, masks, tents and food rations for the victims of the wildfire, hosted in three schools and a Catholic church.[8] The fire at Camino La P\u00f3lvora was worsened by another fire at Fundo Las Cenizas, which forced the authorities to request interregional support of firefighters. With strong winds and difficult access, the process of extinguishing the fire has proven challenging.[15] The Chilean Red Cross chapter started the \"Todos con Valpara\u00edso y su gente\" (Everyone with Valpara\u00edso and its people) campaign, to help victims of the wildfire.[16] Other NGOs and institutions have also collaborated in relief efforts.[17] Esval (the local water supply company) announced an outage of supply on 13 April at Achupallas, Re\u00f1aca Alto, Santa Julia, Villa Dulce Ampliaci\u00f3n, Curauma, and Placilla de Pe\u00f1uelas.[17] The wildfire re-activated in areas of Cerro Ramaditas, Rocuant, and Cuesta Colorada on 13 April, between 20:45 and 21:15 local time; the outbreaks of fire left 100 additional destroyed houses.[18] Two fire engines collided as they were reaching the area, leaving two injured firefighters.[19] On 14 April (two days after the wildfire started), about twenty-one aircraft worked on the fire extinguishment.[20] Local firefighters reported an outbreak of fire at Ramaditas and Mariposa hills; while the ONEMI reported on 14 April afternoon there was an active fire in Fundo Los Perales. The office also announced three (out of thirteen) people killed by the wildfire were identified. The government announced the grant of 500\u00a0million Chilean pesos (approx. one million US dollars) to the commune of Valpara\u00edso, because of the emergency.[21]"

The Mayor of London reported that the number of fire brigade emergency calls was seven times the normal.[17]"

Although a fire station is located in the east of the village, the crews had been called out to other fires.[6][2][13] The fire brigade was called at 13:06, and a fire engine arrived seven minutes later, by which time the fire had expanded.[6][18] One firefighter told LBC News that \"it felt apocalyptic, just crazy, we were chasing it and we had no chance of stopping it\".[19][20] Residents took shelter in the nearby St Mary and St Peter's Church. The church filled with smoke while they were sheltering and the fire burned through the graveyard around the building, but the church itself was not damaged.[14][21] Parish churchwarden Tim Stock said that his family had \"lost everything\" but had managed to evacuate his family and pets.[14][22] Claire Taylor said that her house burned down \"within two minutes\" and that she lost almost all her family's possessions.[23][4][24] One resident said that grass fires in the area were quite common \"but it's nothing like this...this is like the apocalypse.\"[25] Stock commented that \"it was like a warzone...all the windows had exploded out, all the rooves had caved, it was like a scene from the Blitz\".[26]"

Twenty years in the fire service and I've never really seen devastation like it.\"[13][32] Paul Davies, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, commented that the heatwave would have been \"impossible in the pre-industrial era\".[19] LFB Assistant Commissioner Jonathan Smith commented \"we are increasingly being challenged by new extremes of weather as our climate changes and we're developing long-term strategies to deal with more incidents like this in the future.\"[6] Another grass fire began burning in the area three days later,[33] and another in August.[34] Three Conservative Party councillors elected to Havering Council for the Rainham & Wennington ward subsequently switched to Havering Residents Association as they felt unsupported following the wildfire.[35]"

A powerful extratropical cyclone traversing the Pacific Ocean produced localized supercell thunderstorms along coastal Oregon. The Portland branch of the National Weather Service issued a record-breaking ten tornado warnings that morning for their forecast area. One particular cell spawned an EF2 tornado at 8:18\u00a0a.m. PDT (15:18\u00a0UTC) which traveled through the center of Manzanita. Although it lasted only two minutes, the tornado damaged 128\u00a0homes, rendered one uninhabitable, and downed one-third of the city's trees. No injuries or deaths were reported and damage reached $1\u00a0million. A state of emergency was declared for Manzanita immediately after the tornado; however, clean-up operations had to be delayed for two days as another storm system impacted the region. In the months following the tornado, approximately $70,000 was raised through various donations."

        "content": "During the overnight hours of October\u00a013\u201314, 2016, a powerful extratropical cyclone approached the Pacific Northwest. The Storm Prediction Center noted a low possibility for thunderstorms in association with this system as it neared the coast, and primarily focused on the large-scale damaging wind threat. Atmospheric instability only reached modest levels locally, represented by convective available potential energy (CAPE) values of 200\u2013400 J/kg.[1] Low-level wind shear reached values just supportive enough for tornadic development within low-topped thunderstorms developing along a cold front offshore.[2] Subsequent enhancement of mid-level lapse rates from cold air aloft in combination with the aforementioned factors yielded a localized environment favorable to low-topped supercells along the immediate Oregon coast.[3] Several potentially tornadic storms developed during the morning hours and impacted the state,[4] prompting a flurry of tornado warnings by the Portland branch of the National Weather Service. Ten tornado warnings were issued that day, the most ever by the office in a 24-hour period and almost as many as the total number issued between 1986 and 2015.[5][6] At 8:16\u00a0a.m. PDT (15:16\u00a0UTC), a warning was issued for Tillamook County for a rotating thunderstorm.[7] Two minutes later, a waterspout moved ashore along Treasure Cove Lane in Manzanita. The tornado traveled approximately 0.7 miles (1.1\u00a0km) through the center of the city,[8][9] reaching a maximum width of 225 yards (206\u00a0m) and causing extensive damage, before dissipating two minutes later near Highway 101.[8][10] Peak winds in the tornado were estimated at 125\u2013130\u00a0mph (201\u2013209\u00a0km/h), ranking it as a high-end EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.[8] The parent thunderstorm soon encountered a more stable environment and weakened as it continued inland.[4] A second tornado, also originating as a waterspout, was confirmed in Oceanside\u201418 miles (29\u00a0km) south of Manzanita\u2014around 9:00\u00a0a.m. PDT (16:00\u00a0UTC), dissipated without causing damage, and was rated EFU.[11] With two confirmed tornadoes, the October\u00a014, 2016, event marked the first time since November\u00a012, 1991, that more than one tornado touched down in a single day in Northwest Oregon.[9] Furthermore, the Manzanita tornado was only the fifth tornado in Tillamook County since reliable records began in 1950.[12]"

Assessments by the Tillamook County Sheriff and National Weather Service showed that 128 of the city's 600\u00a0homes sustained varying damage.[10][13] Some homes had their windows blown out.[14] Two businesses were destroyed and one home was rendered uninhabitable; multiple structures lost their roof.[10] One home was shifted 19 inches (48\u00a0cm) off its cinderblock foundation.[15] Approximately one-third of the trees in Manzanita were downed or otherwise damaged.[10] Damage in the city amounted to $1\u00a0million.[8] The tornado and thunderstorm left 500 of the city's residents without power;[16] 2,500\u00a0people suffered power outages across Tillamook County from the storms as a whole.[17] Manzanita Mayor Garry Bullard declared a state of emergency immediately following the tornado.[14] A public shelter was temporarily opened at the Calvary Bible Church by the American Red Cross for displaced residents,[9] and volunteers from the relief group arrived to provide aid.[10] However, residents were initially advised to shelter in place due to continued inclement weather.[18] Additionally, 35\u00a0members of the Emergency Volunteer Corps of Nehalem Bay traveled to the city to help direct traffic and provide any assistance requested of them. The group opened two emergency shelters and provided food to residents and emergency officials.[17] As a precautionary measure, volunteer firefighters were called in and an extra ambulance was provided by Tillamook County to the city.[14] Soon after the tornado, another powerful storm system\u2014associated with the remnants of Typhoon Songda\u2014impacted the region,[14] forcing residents to make quick, temporary repairs and delaying clean-up efforts until October\u00a016.[19] Heavy machinery, including snowplows,[20] was brought in to clear roads, with assistance from local contractors. State and local officials asked people to avoid the damaged area for three days after the tornado.[21] Residents of Manzanita, a tourism-driven community, banded together to establish a relief fund for affected home and business owners.[19] In the months following the tornado, approximately $70,000 was raised through donations: $31,000 through various GoFundMe charities (including $1,000 from the company itself), $18,000 from mail-in individual donations, $17,000 through local fundraisers, and $2,625 though CARE.[22] The City of Manzanita spent $35,000 to remove debris by November\u00a010.[23] Reconstruction of damage homes began in November; however, insurance freezes delayed efforts.[24] More than 200\u00a0trees were replanted by community members after Thanksgiving.[22] Widespread strong winds from the parent storm system left 15,000\u00a0people without power in Oregon. Winds gusted up to 103\u00a0mph (166\u00a0km/h) at Cape Meares while Portland saw its rainiest October\u00a013 since reliable records began. The inclement weather prompted multiple schools to delay openings on October\u00a013 and 14.[14]"

        "content": " The Woolsey Fire was a wildfire that started in Los Angeles County and spread north to  neighboring Ventura County, both located in the U.S. state of California. The fire ignited on November 8, 2018 and wasn't fully contained until November 21, 2018. The fire burned 96,949 acres (39,234 hectares) of land, destroyed 1,643 structures,[4] killed three people, and prompted the evacuation of more than 295,000 people.[3] It was one of several fires in California that ignited on the same day, along with the nearby Hill Fire and the destructive Camp Fire in Northern California.[6][7] The fire started in Woolsey Canyon on the Santa Susana Field Laboratory property, and burned 80% of the site, a complex of industrial research and development buildings belonging to Boeing, in the Santa Susana Mountains above the Simi Valley near the boundary between Los Angeles and Ventura counties.[8][9] The Santa Ana winds, which often are a factor for Southern California fires, pushed the fire in a southerly direction throughout the first day.[10][11] The Ventura Freeway (US 101) between the San Fernando Valley and the Conejo Valley was closed as the fire crossed and headed into the rugged Santa Monica Mountains. The fire raced through the chaparral-covered steep canyons where it encountered historic movie and TV sets, small ranches, and the houses of celebrities.[12] Hundreds of houses in Malibu were destroyed or damaged on both sides of Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1). Many of these were on Point Dume that juts out from the narrow coastal terrace that lies between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean. The mitigation measures Pepperdine University had in place successfully protected the campus, with students sheltering in place, to the south. The entire sparsely populated portion of the Malibu coast west to the community of Solromar, which includes state and national parklands, suffered damage from the fire. The fire cost at least $6 billion (2018 USD) in property damage.[5] Thousands of residents were kept away from their houses in numerous neighborhoods along the Ventura Freeway and the communities along the Malibu coast. The evacuations frustrated residents as they lasted for many days as the fire continued to threaten houses especially when the winds increased and fanned the flames. The evacuated residents were incrementally allowed to return to see if their houses were damaged or destroyed as the fire continued to spread through the rugged wilderness at the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains. Authorities in many of the damaged communities declared that they needed to prevent residents from returning quickly as neighborhoods were crowded with crews repairing downed power lines and other hazardous conditions. In the months after the fire, residents criticized what they thought was a slow and inadequate response by cities and counties during public meetings held by public officials. While this and other fires were burning, President Donald Trump blamed poor forest management by the state. One fire scientist explained that forest management (good or bad) had a minor influence on the severity of the fires, and that Woolsey was not a forest fire.[13] The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating an equipment problem near the point of origin reported by Southern California Edison."

During the overnight hours into the early morning of November 9, the fire crossed U.S. Route 101 near Calabasas and spread through Liberty Canyon in Agoura Hills. Aerial suppression of the fire was unable to commence until 5:00\u00a0a.m. PST, November 9, when winds lessened enough. On the morning of November 9, Assistant L.A. County Fire Chief Williams told KBUU-LP that his request for 70 strike teams had been denied.[23] The blaze spread rapidly throughout the day burning through the mountains and along the 101 Freeway, eventually reaching Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu by the afternoon devastating numerous houses there. Firefighters and firetrucks who did not know the area were reported idle by many frustrated citizens.[24][25] Several homeowners stayed despite the mandatory evacuation to defend their houses.[26][27] Pepperdine University in Malibu recommended that students shelter in place in specific buildings on campus rather than use the crowded highway to evacuate. Farther north, the flames spread to portions of Thousand Oaks, Bell Canyon, Westlake Village, Oak Park[28] and the West Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles forcing residential evacuations and the closure of numerous business and corporate offices in the region.[29] On the day before the Hill and Woolsey fires started, residents in the Conejo Valley experienced the shooting of thirteen people in a bar including a police officer and the perpetrator. As the fires threatened the community and otherwise disrupted their routine, memorial services had to be postponed.[30] By November 9, Cal Fire and the United States Forest Service were also helping local services with the fire.[31][32] This resulted in 3,242\u00a0firefighters being deployed to contain the blaze by the morning of November 10.[1] The fire had engulfed more than 70,000 acres (28,000 hectares) of land, forcing the evacuation of an estimated 295,000 people from 105,000 residences.[33] This included an unprecedented total evacuation of Bell Canyon,[1] Malibu,[28] Agoura Hills, Malibou Lake, and Oak Park.[1] Before sunrise on November 14, the fire flared up in rugged wilderness at the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains with winds blowing strongly.[34] The fire burned well away from populated neighborhoods, but was threatening scattered home sites. The flare-up sent a huge column of smoke over Point Mugu and out to sea.[35] By November 21 at 6:11\u00a0p.m. PST, the fire was 100% contained.[1]"

The fire caused trails to be shut for months as 88% of the federal parkland was burned.[36] The fire created a challenge to native plants as black mustard with bright yellow flowers quickly established itself post-fire.[37] Thirteen mountain lions with radio collars were within the fire area according to National Park Service researchers.[38] Repairs were needed to the Ventura Freeway at the proposed location of the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing designed to benefit the mountain lions.[39] Two people were found dead in a vehicle on Mulholland Highway in Malibu.[40] Emergency personnel were unable to reach the victims when a report of a critical burn victim was relayed, due to downed power lines.[28][41] On Tuesday November 13, a third victim was discovered in the 32000 block of Lobo Canyon Road in Agoura Hills.[42] The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced on January 22, 2019, that charred human remains had been found in the burn area in Malibu and that homicide detectives were trying to determine if the victim had been killed in the flames or had met with foul play.[43] The fire destroyed 1643 structures and damaged 364,[44] including at least 1600\u00a0houses destroyed by the fire.[28][45] Several celebrities were among those who lost their houses, including Jonathan Banks,[46] Kim Basinger,[47] Tracey E.

At least two were destroyed or significantly damaged.[73] Three Jewish summer camps JCA Shalom, Gindling Hilltop, and Camp Hess Kramer were almost completely devastated in the fire.[74] There were two cases of looting in Ventura County, one of which resulted in a car chase.[40] Reporters and officials rescued animals from houses, and brought them to shelters and vets.[75] Other animals at locations such as Malibu Wines were either evacuated or cared for at the locations.[76] Local fire officials opened Zuma Beach as an evacuation point for large animals, with pictures by the Los Angeles Times, showing llamas, alpacas, and horses tied to lifeguard stations and poles.[77] Clean up of materials like asbestos, pesticides, plastics, and electronic devices began almost immediately after the flames were out.

Part of a larger severe weather event that impacted the Central United States, the tornado first touched down in Lee County at 6:39\u00a0p.m. CDT (23:39\u00a0UTC). It progressed through the counties of Ogle, DeKalb, and Boone before finally dissipating at 7:20\u00a0p.m. CDT. Along the tornado's 30.14-mile (48.51\u00a0km) path, numerous structures were heavily damaged or destroyed, especially in the small town of Fairdale where two fatalities and eleven injuries were recorded. A few well-constructed homes were swept completely away, indicative of peak winds near 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h), the upper bounds of an EF4 tornado. In the aftermath of the event, hundreds of citizens assisted in cleanup and recovery efforts. Economic losses from the tornado reached $19\u00a0million (equivalent to $24,000,000 in 2023)."

        "content": "On April\u00a04, 2015, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued their Day 6 severe weather outlook, highlighting a substantial and widespread risk for severe weather from southeastern Oklahoma to northeastern Illinois valid for April\u00a09.[2] This threat area was maintained in the Day 5 outlook and narrowed to a corridor from southern Missouri into northern Illinois in the Day 4 outlook.[3][4] On April\u00a07, a Day 3 Enhanced risk was issued across most of Illinois, eastern Missouri, and small portions of adjacent states. No further changes to the threat level were made, although the Enhanced risk was significantly expanded late on April\u00a08 to include portions of the southern Great Lakes, lower Ohio Valley, Ozark Plateau, and Ark-La-Tex region.[5] Around midday on April\u00a09, the SPC issued a 10% hatched tornado threat area across much of northern Illinois and small portions of nearby states, signifying the potential for several tornadoes, of which one or two had the potential to be strong (EF2 or stronger on the Enhanced Fujita scale).[6] The catalyst for the severe weather outbreak came as a positively-tilted shortwave trough progressed across the central High Plains into the Great Plains and eventually through the western Great Lakes region. A weaker disturbance pushed from the Ozarks into the Northeastern United States, acting to strengthen southwesterly winds aloft across the risk area. At the surface, a weak area of low pressure initially centered over northeastern Kansas early on April\u00a09 progressed steadily northeast while intensifying, reaching the trisection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois by late that evening. A cold front stemming from the low progressed eastward across the Mid-South, whereas an arching warm front slowly pushed northward across eastern Iowa and northern Illinois. Modest surface heating ahead of the cold front allowed mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values to reach 1,000\u20131,500 J/kg, and a mass of rich moisture transported northward from the Gulf of Mexico pushed dewpoints into the lower 60s \u00b0F across the Enhanced risk area.[7] Winds at 850 mb (4,781\u00a0ft) strengthened at or above 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) below winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) at 700\u00a0m (2,300\u00a0ft), creating a favorable setup for sustained supercells. Although the overall directional component of low-level winds was expected to be less than ideal as a whole, a small area of southeasterly surface winds developed near the surface low in northern Illinois.[6] At 1:50\u00a0p.m. CDT (18:50\u00a0UTC), the SPC issued a tornado watch for northern and central Illinois, far northwestern Indiana, far southern Wisconsin, and portions of Lake Michigan. A 60% chance of two or more tornadoes was assessed across the watch box, with a 40% chance of at least one strong tornado.[8] Isolated shower activity began forming across the region just prior to the issuance of watch,[9] eventually growing into a line of strong to severe thunderstorms, including supercells.[10] One such high-precipitation supercell was first severe warned at 6:11\u00a0p.m. CDT (23:11\u00a0UTC); the National Weather Service office in Chicago, Illinois warned of winds up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and quarter- to golf ball-sized hail.[11] The weather forecast office upgraded the severe thunderstorm warning to a tornado warning at 6:35\u00a0p.m. CDT (23:35\u00a0UTC), and four minutes later, trained storm spotters reported a damaging tornado north of Ashton.[12] This was one of several tornadoes observed across the Central United States on April\u00a08 and April\u00a09.[13]"

        "content": "The tornado first began at 6:39\u00a0p.m. CDT (23:39\u00a0UTC) on April\u00a09, just northeast of Franklin Grove, Illinois. It touched down over a field, producing swirls in crops, before moving northeast and causing EF1 damage to the Crest Foods plant. The tornado soon exited Lee County and entered Ogle County, inflicting EF1 damage to two farm outbuildings that were completely destroyed and EF0 damage to a similar structure that had a portion of its roof uplifted. Intensifying to EF3 strength, much more severe damage was noted along South Skare Court as the tornado entered an area of semi-rural subdivisions to the northwest of Rochelle. A few homes in this area were destroyed at EF3 intensity, with other homes nearby sustaining EF2 damage. One large house had a room ripped off on its second floor, while a split-level home was almost completely leveled.[14] As the tornado crossed South Richard Road, it intensified to very high-end EF4 strength and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled a few inches from its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened, producing EF2 to EF3 damage as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached and crossed IL 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed in this area.[14] Very high-end EF4 damage was again observed near the intersection of IL 64 and IL 251, where a row of five homes was completely leveled, two of which were swept away. Anchor bolts were again present at these residences, though the foundations were of cinder-block construction. Intense ground scouring was evident nearby, a car was thrown a full mile (1.6 km), and debris was wind-rowed long distances through fields in this area. Winds were again estimated at 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h), with the damage at this location again being near-EF5 in intensity. Further to the northeast, the tornado inflicted high-end EF4 damage as a large farmstead was completely destroyed. A well-constructed barn was obliterated, and a 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) reinforced concrete silo was reduced to a pile of rubble. A large farmhouse on the property was completely swept away, and nearby trees were severely stripped and debarked. The tornado weakened as it crossed North Moore Road, where a warehouse building had a collapse of its non-bearing exterior walls. One small barn or outbuilding had a collapse of exterior walls while another had a few metal roof panels ripped off. After crossing Interstate 39, it caused moderate roof damage to a large residence and tossed and rolled a heavy barn. The tornado continued to produce generally EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings before exiting Ogle County, and it was briefly accompanied by an EF0 satellite tornado that damaged crops to its southeast.[14] After entering DeKalb County, the large tornado directly impacted the small community of Fairdale. Approximately 71 homes sustained some degree of damage, including 13 that were destroyed. Several houses on the northwest side of town sustained damage consistent with an upper-end EF3 tornado, with all walls collapsed. A few houses that were nailed to the foundation\u2014not bolted\u2014were swept clean. Neighbors Geraldine Schultz and Jacklyn Klosa were both killed in their homes, and an additional 11 people were injured throughout the town, including Geraldine's husband, Clarence.[15] Continuing northeast across Wheeler Road, one residence had a large portion of its roof ripped off, a second residence had its exterior walls collapsed, and a two-story 80-year-old well-constructed barn was destroyed. A large garage was destroyed and had its debris deposited well downstream, and significant denuding and debarking of trees was evident. Near the intersection of Irene Road and McNeal Road, a well-built seven-year-old house lost its second story and many exterior walls. A two-story well-built barn with cinder block attachment was totally destroyed, and a nearby two-story rebar-reinforced cinder block silo was ripped apart. Large farm equipment was tossed 0.25\u20130.5\u00a0mi (0.40\u20130.80\u00a0km), and convergent scouring of road pavement was noted in this area. After passing over rural terrain, the tornado finally dissipated at 7:20\u00a0p.m. CDT (00:20\u00a0UTC) over Cherry Valley Road, ending its 30.14\u00a0mi (48.51\u00a0km) and 41-minute path of destruction.[14]"

Both the governor and Illinois U.S. Senator Mark Kirk toured the area.[28] Total economic losses from the tornado reached $19\u00a0million (equivalent to $24,000,000 in 2023[1]).[29][30][31][32]"

A tropical disturbance formed in the middle of July\u00a01991 in the eastern portion of the Western Pacific monsoon trough, and while tracking to the west-northwest, was designated a tropical depression on July\u00a021. Thunderstorm activity associated with the depression increased markedly on July\u00a022, and two days later, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Caitlin. The storm turned northward as it rounded a subtropical ridge while gradually intensifying. Caitlin became a typhoon on July\u00a025 and peaked in intensity on July\u00a027 near Okinawa. The typhoon began to weaken as it turned northeast over the Korea Strait. On July\u00a030, Catlin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it entered the Sea of Japan. Across the Philippines, heavy rains triggered mudslides that claimed 16\u00a0lives and forced over 20,000\u00a0others to be evacuated. Due to the storm, reservoir levels in Okinawa on the island rose from only 35% to over 80% of its capacity and crop damage amounted to $7.4\u00a0million USD. On Kagoshima Prefecture, 72\u00a0homes were damaged and five million people were left without power. Twenty-three people suffered injuries in Nagasaki Prefecture while 116\u00a0ships were damaged offshore. On the Goto Islands, 32\u00a0people were rendered homeless.  Throughout Japan, six fatalities were reported and thirty-nine others sustained injuries. A total of 64\u00a0houses were destroyed while 1,472\u00a0others were flooded. Moreover, 120\u00a0ships and 263\u00a0ha (650\u00a0acres) of farmland were destroyed. Damages totaled \u00a510.1\u00a0billion ($75\u00a0million USD). In South Korea, two people were killed and another two were listed as missing. Heavy rains caused flooding across residential areas and destroyed farmland. Around 30\u00a0ships were destroyed or damaged. Damage throughout the country was estimated at $6.3\u00a0million USD."

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Caitlin can be traced back to a disturbance that formed in the middle of July in the eastern portion of the Western Pacific monsoon trough that extended south of Pohnpei in the eastern Caroline Islands. The disturbance moved west-northwestward, and although the low level center was initially displaced to the west of the deep convection, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began tracking the system at 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020.[1] On the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system a tropical depression.[2][nb 1] Wind shear began to diminish on July\u00a022, coinciding with falling pressures at Yap and increased convective activity. At 05:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a023, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the JTWC, and eight hours later, the JTWC declared the system Tropical Depression 09W.[1] On July\u00a024, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started watching the storm and assigned it the local name Ising.[4] A rapid increase in convection prompted both the JTWC and JMA to upgrade the depression into Tropical Storm Caitlin the same day.[5][nb 2] Tropical Storm Caitlin tracked west-northwestward until July\u00a024, when a semi-permanent subtropical ridge weakened near 130\u00b0E, which caused the tropical storm to make a sharp northward turn; this turn was forecast well in advance by the Navy Operational Global Prediction System. Caitlin slowly intensified,[1] and on the evening of July\u00a024, the JMA classified Caitlin as a severe tropical storm.[2] Satellite imagery depicted a cloud-filled eye,[1] and midday on July\u00a025, the JTWC upgraded Caitlin into a typhoon,[7] with the JMA following suit that evening.[1] At the time of the upgrade, Typhoon Caitlin was located around 440\u00a0km (275\u00a0mi) south of Okinawa.[8] Continuing to intensify,[5] Caitlin turned to the north-northwest. The typhoon passed 110\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi) west of Kadena Air Base at 15:32\u00a0UTC on July\u00a027. Less than three hours later, the JTWC reported that Caitlin attained its peak intensity of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[1] Meanwhile, the JMA estimated a peak intensity of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[2] After passing Okinawa, the typhoon tracked north-northeastward around the periphery of a broad subtropical ridge. On July\u00a029, Caitlin, while weakening, accelerated towards the northeast through the Korea Strait, and gradually transitioned into a typhoon force extratropical low as it moved into the Sea of Japan. The JTWC issued its final warning was issued early on July\u00a030 when satellite imagery indicated the system had lost most of its tropical characteristics.[1] Six hours later, the JMA also declared Caitlin extratropical.[2]"

Guerrero, the first person of native Chamorro descent to rise to the highest office in the territory, three Guamanian Governors have been affiliated with the party: Ricardo J. Bordallo, Carl T.C.

This dominance continued even when the Territorial Party was formed near the end of the decade and there was finally two-party competition in the electoral process. A leading figure of the Popular Party was Speaker Antonio B. Won Pat who was later elected as Guam's first delegate to the U.S. Congress.[2] In 1961, the Popular Party of Guam had secured affiliation with the national Democratic Party and was rechristened the Democratic Party of Guam.[1] The Democrats gained control of the Legislature in the 1966 elections and retained the majority for the next eight years.[2]"

Leon Guerrero's term from 1963 until 1969 was marked by the recovery from Typhoon Karen, including support for Guam under the Guam Rehabilitation Act, the establishment of the Guam Economic Development Authority, and the establishment of the Guam Tourist Commission, later to become the Guam Visitors Bureau.[7] In the first race for elected governor, Manuel F. Leon Guerrero teamed up with Dr. Antonio C. \"Tony\" Yamashita, President of the University of Guam. They were challenged by Speaker Joaquin C. Arriola and retired Judge Vicente Bamba and team of Senator Ricardo J. \"Ricky\" Bordallo and Richard F. \"Dick\" Taitano, former Director of the Office of Territories. Guerrero/Yamashita were defeated during the primary election by Bordallo/Taitano.

Governor Bordallo had the largest inauguration Guam had ever seen with about 15,000 people in the Plaza de Espana.[8] In May 1976, Supertyphoon Pamela devastated Guam, leaving extensive damage.[9] Government officials preliminarily estimated that 80% of the buildings were damaged to some degree, of which half were destroyed.[10] President Gerald Ford declared Guam a major disaster area.[11] Governor Bordallo seized upon the devastation of Typhoon Pamela as an opportunity to reconstruct Guam and pursue what was called a Marshall Program for Guam. Governor Bordallo secured about $367 million in federal funds to Guam.[8] During his second term, retired Lieutenant colonel Edward Diego \"Eddie\" Reyes, served as Lieutenant Governor. Bordallo chaired the Commission for Self-Determination and spearheaded the drafting of the Guam Commonwealth Act developed by June 4, 1986. He addressed Guam's education problems with his 1983 \"Blueprint for Excellence\" and worked on the accreditation status of the University of Guam."

Reyes and Gloria B. Nelson. The Gutierrez-Bordallo team received 9,555 votes while the Reyes-Nelson team received only 6,450 votes.[12] In the 1994 General Election, the Democratic team of Gutierrez-Bordallo faced the Republican team of Thomas V.C. Tanaka and Doris Flores Brooks. During the general election, Tanaka-Brooks outspent the Gutierrez-Bordallo team by over $100,000, but Carl Gutierrez and Madeleine Bordallo won the election in a landslide with 23,405 votes, while Tanaka-Brooks had 19,281.[12] Upon assuming office on January 2, 1995, Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez focused his work in the areas of infrastructure so that all the marginalized people will be brought into the 20th century before it went out and also pushing for economic development by aggressively completing 85% of his Vision 2001 plan by the end of 1999. Despite a super majority Republican Legislature that opposed virtually every executive initiative, the Gutierrez-Bordallo administration was successful in guiding the island through the rough waters of economic downturns throughout the region. The tourism economy was also severely affected by the crash of Korean Airlines Flight 801 on August 6, 1997. During the rescue efforts, Gutierrez was one of the first responders and the first to reach the burning plane along with Dep. Fire Chief Chuck Sanchez and his security police officer Cecil Sulla. Gutierrez was credited with saving several lives, including 11-year-old Rika Matsuda [13] and Barry Small, an injured helicopter mechanic from New Zealand, who called Governor Gutierrez a \"Hero.\" Gutierrez received the Eagle Award, the highest award given to a civilian by the U.S. National Guard Bureau. He was recognized by the governments of Japan and the Republic of Korea. In December 1997, Typhoon Paka struck Guam. The strong winds from Paka left around 1,500\u00a0buildings destroyed on the island,[14] of which 1,160 were single-family homes.[15] A further 10,000\u00a0buildings sustained damage to some degree,[14] with 60% of the homes on the island reporting major damage.[15] In all, about 5,000\u00a0people were left homeless due to the typhoon. Additionally, an estimated 30\u201340% of the public buildings received major damage.[15] Buildings on the island made of reinforced concerted fared well, as opposed to light metal-frame structures, which more often were completely destroyed. Large tourist hotels near Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a, on which Guam is dependent, received generally minor damage, such as broken windows and damaged power generators.[14] A complete island-wide power outage followed the typhoon; damage to the main electrical transmission and distribution system was estimated at USD16\u00a0million. Following the passage of the typhoon, 25% of the homes on Guam were left without water.[15] Telephone service remained working after the storm, due to most lines being underground. Strong waves washed away a few coastal roads in the northern portion of the island, leaving them temporarily closed. The waves surpassed the seawall at Apra Harbor, damaging the road and infrastructure of the seaport; many boats were washed ashore after breaking from their moorings. Strong winds damaged a radar system and lights along the runway of the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, though most airport facilities received light damage. The Andersen Air Force Base also sustained heavy damage, with hundreds of downed trees and many facilities left damaged.[14] Across Guam, damage was estimated at USD500\u00a0million.[15] About 100\u00a0people were injured,[16] but the typhoon caused no deaths on the island.[15]"

There were two Democratic teams that challenged the Gutierrez-Bordallo team in the primary. Senator Thomas C. Ada and Senator Lou Leon Guerrero ran as a team, as did Senator Angel L.G. Santos and Jose T. \"Pedo\" Terlaje. The Gutierrez-Bordallo carried the 1998 Democratic primary with 16,838 votes, compared with only 9,788 for Ada-Leon Guerrero and 6,295 for Santos-Terlaje.[17] In the 1998 General Election, Gutierrez-Bordallo faced the Republican team of Former Governor Joseph Franklin Ada and Senator Felix Perez Camacho. The election resulted in a second term for Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez and Lieutenant Governor Madeleine Z. Bordallo, who won with 24,250 votes, compared with 21,200 votes for Ada-Camacho.[17] In the 1998 Gubernatorial election against former governor Joe Ada, an election challenge by Ada/Camacho went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision by the Supreme court was 9\u20130 in favor of Gutierrez/Bordallo, thus ending the Republican challenge. Just following the reelection of Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez and Madeleine Z. Bordallo, President William Jefferson Clinton visited Guam on November 23, 1998.[18] The visit was the first since 1986 when a sitting U.S. president had visited Guam. Thousands of Guamanians gathered on the field in front of the Ricardo J. Bordallo Governor's Complex to see President Clinton. The crowd was treated to a rousing rendition of the Star Spangled Banner by Joseph \"Uncle Tote\" Cunningham and several speakers addressed the assembled crowd.[19] President Clinton was introduced by youth speaker Michael F.Q. San Nicolas.[20] Gutierrez's credibility and integrity have been under constant attack by those who oppose him and his style of leadership. Beginning when he was still in office, efforts are continuing to try to find him guilty of purported crimes. He has never been found guilty of any crime, winning all cases that went to trial. Other cases were thrown out of court because they had no merit. His second term in office was marked by political instability caused by the 1998 election challenges, a supermajority Republican (12\u20133) Guam Legislature, an unsuccessful Recall Movement in 2000 after the Supreme court decision came out giving Gutierrez/Bordallo the win, the \"rolling\" power outages left behind by the Ada/Blas administration,  the destruction of the island's infrastructure by Supertyphoons Chata'an, Paka, and Pongsona."

Bush concurred, and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts.[15] Over 6,000 firefighters worked to fight the blazes; they were aided by units of the United States Armed Forces,[16] United States National Guard,[17] almost 3,000 prisoners convicted of non-violent crimes,[18] and 60 firefighters from the Mexican cities of Tijuana and Tecate.[19] The fires forced approximately 1,000,000 people to evacuate from their homes, becoming the largest evacuation in California's history.[20] Major contributing factors to the extreme fire conditions were drought in Southern California, hot weather, and the unusually strong Santa Ana winds, with gusts reaching 112\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).[5][21] California's \"fire season,\" which traditionally runs from June to October, has become a year-round threat, due to a mixture of perennial drought and the increasing number of homes built in canyons and on hillsides, surrounded by brush and forest.[22] The fires had numerous sources. Several were triggered by power lines damaged by the high winds.[23][24] One fire started when a semi-truck overturned.[25] Another was suspected as having been deliberately caused; the suspect was shot and killed in flight by state authorities.[26] A 10-year-old boy admitted that he accidentally started the Buckweed Fire by playing with matches.[27] The causes of the remaining fires remain under investigation. The last active fire of the October 2007 fires, the Harris Fire, was fully extinguished on November 16, 2007, about 27 days after the series of wildfires had begun to ignite.[28][29] The October 2007 wildfires collectively caused over $2 billion in property damages.[8][9] During the season, the National Interagency Fire Center reported that two firefighters were killed. One died in a helicopter crash, and the second was killed in a bulldozer rollover.[30]"

This combination of wind, heat, and dryness turned the chaparral into fire fuel. Officials believed that some of the fires generated their own winds, similar to the Oakland firestorm of 1991. The effects of the smoke were felt as far away as Brentwood in the East Bay, near Stockton, where it impacted local weather. High-speed Santa Ana winds also rendered the use of dropping water from fire fighting aircraft inefficient: until such winds abate, most payloads of water are just dispersed by the wind over an area so large that the water evaporates before it can reach a large fire on the ground. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported, Santa Ana winds blowing up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) combined with temperatures into the 90s to create in the worst possible fire conditions.[35] At one point, swirling winds threatened to bring fire into densely populated urban areas.[22] At the height of the Santa Ana winds on October 22, sustained wind speeds reached 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), with wind gusts up to 112\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) reported.[5]"

This outage also caused 230 people to be without power in Malibu.[37] The California Independent System Operator Corp declared an energy transmission emergency in southern California on October 23, due to wildfires affecting the lines. 500,000-, 230,000- and 138,000-volt lines were disabled in San Diego, and some lines in other areas were also disabled. 24,992 people lost power, due to the lack of power from the power grid.[36] During the crisis, Mexico provided power to help augment the electrical needs of the San Diego area.[38] Authorities have stated that the evacuations, which displaced more than 900,000 people, have been the largest evacuation number in the history of California.[39] By mid-morning on October 22, 2007, thousands of evacuees were taking shelter in Qualcomm Stadium and other locations throughout San Diego.[40] On the afternoon of October 22, 2007, the Marines evacuated some planes from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to other military bases in California and Arizona.[41] The Navy moved all non-essential personnel from Naval Base San Diego barracks onto nearby vessels to accommodate refugees.[17] The San Diego Wild Animal Park moved some animals to the on-site animal hospital for their protection.[42] The Horno Fire had charred 6,000 acres (24\u00a0km2) in Camp Pendleton by 4:00 A.M PDT, on October 24, 2007. It caused the closure of Interstate 5 and it also caused Amtrak California to stop Pacific Surfliner service between Oceanside and San Clemente.[43] Traffic was being diverted to Interstate 15, which had itself been closed earlier.[44]\nIllegal migrant workers were endangered by the crisis, sometimes staying at work in the fields within mandatory evacuation zones. Many had lived in the canyons nearby and distrusted officials.[45] When fleeing the fires, some were arrested, while others were turned away from shelters due to lack of adequate identification.[46] Some Mexican firefighters expressed concern about their countrymen, while others felt the migrant workers were aware of the risks they were taking.[47] Only a few cases of looting were documented. Six people were arrested for stealing supplies from Qualcomm stadium,[48] another was arrested for theft after being found in possession of stolen goods in the Jamul fire area,[49] and two were arrested near the Tecate border crossing.[50]"

Officials estimated that 10,000 people were gathered at Qualcomm Stadium, the largest shelter point in San Diego. Besides food, blankets and water, volunteers provided toys for children, massages, and a live rock and roll band performance.[53] CERT teams, in various cities, received their first activation since the program's inception in this region. Trained volunteers provided assistance ranging from coordinating relief, to acting as a fire department auxiliary.[54][55]  Religious groups such as Victim Relief Ministries, Giving Children Hope, Hope Force International, Apostolic World Relief, and the Salvation Army responded by opening places of worship, donating supplies, and feeding workers and evacuees.[56][57] The Department of Defense contributed twelve engines for firefighting efforts. The National Guard called more than 2,400 troops,[58] with 17,000 available if needed; of which 100 California National Guard medical personnel provided medical assistance.[17] Six crews from the Navy's Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 85 based at Naval Air Station North Island were assigned to battle the Witch Creek fire. They flew MH-60 Seahawk helicopters equipped with a 420-gallon water bucket and they were the only local Navy teams trained to fight fires from the air. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar contributed several aircraft as well as fire fighting trucks to operations based in Ramona.[16] One of the larger airtankers, the Martin Mars, sent through a private contract from its home in Port Alberni, British Columbia on October 25, landing on Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, California. It has a 7,000 gallon capacity. Two other airtankers and their crews from Quebec worked on the fires, part of an annual three-month contract with the state of California.[59] California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in seven California counties where fires burned. President George W. Bush concurred[15] and visited the region on Thursday, October 25, 2007.[60][61] Rep. Duncan Hunter criticized state fire officials for delaying the use of Marine helicopters until CalFire spotters were in position to coordinate their efforts. However, California Fire Marshal Kate Dargan said that the Marines and officials at CalFire were following procedures worked out with the military after serious problems with air coordination during the 2003 California wildfires. Other state officials also praised the federal response. Aaron McLear, a spokesman for Schwarzenegger, said the governor \"is getting everything he needs from the federal government\".[62] NBC Nightly News reported that with the evacuations reaching about 950,000\u00a0people, this was the largest peacetime movement of Americans since the Civil War era,[63] although similar evacuation figures were cited for Hurricane Rita[64] and Hurricane Katrina.[65] On November 6, 2007, the state of California reported that the fires were under control. On November 9, the last vole of wildfires were finally contained. According to the state's consolidated report on the fires, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger \"called on the Blue Ribbon Task Force to assess the next steps to take at federal, state and local levels of government to prevent and fight future fires. Additionally, the Governor asked the task force to review the Governor\u2019s Blue Ribbon Fire Commission\u2019s recommendations, generated after the 2003 fires, to evaluate if the recommendations are still the best and most effective ways in preventing and fighting fires.\"[66]"

Fanned by powerful Santa Ana winds, the Witch Creek Fire rapidly spread westward and consumed large portions of San Diego County. During its duration, flames reached 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30\u00a0m) high, and the Witch Fire exhibited the characteristics of a firestorm at its height. On the morning of October 22, 2007, about a day after the Witch Creek Fire had ignited, residents of San Diego County were ordered to evacuate through the Reverse 911 system. Eventually, the Witch Creek Fire led to the evacuations of 500,000 people across San Diego County. It also contributed to mass evacuations across much of Southern California, which saw 1,000,000 residents evacuate, the largest in Californian history.[3] The Witch Fire caused at least $1.142\u00a0billion (equivalent to $1.678\u00a0billion in 2023) in insured damages alone, becoming the costliest wildfire of 2007. As of 2022,[update] the Witch Fire is the nineteenth-largest wildfire in modern California history,[4] as well as the seventh-most destructive wildfire on record in California.[5]"

From there, the fire jumped over Interstate 15 and continued west, causing significant damage in Lake Hodges, Del Dios, and Rancho Santa Fe.[7] Strong Santa Ana winds pushed the fires west towards the coast.[8] San Diego County Sheriff William B. Kolendar stated that the Witch Creek Fire could be \"well in excess of the Cedar Fire of 2003\".[9] While many coastal communities were evacuated as the fire moved west, the shifting winds prevented it from directly threatening those areas.

The extremely powerful Santa Ana winds fanned the wildfires in Southern California, causing many of the wildfires to rapidly expand westward.[10] At 1:30 a.m. on October 22, the Guejito Fire ignited southeast of the San Diego Wild Animal Park, within the San Pasqual River drainage. By early morning, the Guejito Fire had expanded to Interstate 15, forcing the closure of the freeway in both directions, which disrupted some evacuations from areas affected by the Witch Creek Fire.[10][11] In less than an hour, the Witch Creek Fire caught up with the Guejito Fire to the west, and the two fires combined into a single, massive wildfire before dawn. With powerful Santa Ana winds gusting over 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), the Witch Creek Fire then jumped over Interstate 15, rapidly burning into Rancho Bernardo.[10][11] Residents located between the Del Dios Highway and State Route 56 along with the unincorporated area of Escondido were ordered to evacuate.[8][12] A firefighter stated that the conditions they faced were \"twice as bad\" as the Cedar Fire in 2003, with firefighters separating houses into those that they could save and those that they couldn't.[13] The Witch Creek Fire continued to race westward, and by that night, mandatory evacuation orders had been expanded westward to Escondido and Del Mar, all the way up to the coast.[12] A dispatch from the city of Del Mar's web site stated that all Del Mar residents had to evacuate[14] Evacuations were also ordered for Scripps Ranch neighborhood, specifically everything south of Scripps Poway Parkway, north of MCAS Miramar, east of Interstate 15, and west of Highway 67. The Mesa Grande Indian Reservation was also evacuated due to the Witch Fire.[15] Residents of the Barona Indian Reservation were advised to leave, though the evacuation was not mandatory.

Due to the fires, there was no power or phone service in the town.[19] On Wednesday, October 24, the Santa Ana winds began to subside, and the prevailing winds shifted directions, with the onshore flow blowing in from the west; this caused the Witch Creek Fire to reverse directions and begin burning eastward, ending the threat to the coastal communities. This also allowed the fire to burn previously unburned fuel (which was passed over during the initial rapid spread of the fire), threatening communities further east that had so far avoided the worst of the Witch Creek Fire.[10][20] On the same day, some of the evacuation orders in place for Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos, 4S Ranch, and other areas west of Rancho Bernardo were lifted, after the western part of the Witch Creek Fire was contained. However, the evacuation orders in place for eastern and northern Rancho Bernardo, around Lake Hodges, were still in place.[21] The California Highway Patrol closed Interstate 5, after the Ammo Fire burned across the freeway; the Ammo Fire also forced the closures of the Amtrak California Surfliner service between Oceanside and San Clemente. These routes had previously been used to evacuate residents from the Witch Creek Fire areas.[22] Traffic from Interstate 5 was diverted to Interstate 15, which had reopened since the portion of the Witch Creek Fire around Interstate 15 had been extinguished.[23] That day, after the winds had reversed, the Witch Fire began approaching the nearby Poomacha Fire to the north, which was burning near Palomar Mountain, with firefighters and officials fearing that the two wildfires would soon merge.[24] By this time, the Poomacha Fire had grown to 35,000 acres (142\u00a0km2), and also began burning towards Palomar Mountain, to the north. Despite the fact that the Poomacha Fire was still much smaller than the Witch Creek Fire, firefighters were unable to establish a fire perimeter around the younger fire, due to the fact that other larger fires had rendered available firefighters and equipment scarce for the Poomacha Fire.[10][24] On October 25, the Witch Fire and the Poomacha Fire merged into one complex fire, with the two wildfires joining to the south of Palomar Mountain.[10]"

The power line that caused the Witch fires shorted three times in three hours, but the utility did not cut power to it for six hours.[45] In August 2017, administrative law judges S. Pat Tsen and Sasha Goldberg ruled that the utility did not reasonably manage its facilities and that the wildfires were not outside of its control. Therefore, they ruled that the utility could not pass its uninsured costs along to its ratepayers. The PUC agreed in early December in a 5\u20130 vote.[45][46] Legal claims after the fires totaled $5.6\u00a0billion (equivalent to $8.2\u00a0billion in 2023[40]), $2.4\u00a0billion (equivalent to $3.5\u00a0billion[40]) after the utility settled 2,500 lawsuits for damages.[47] The $379\u00a0million (equivalent to $557\u00a0million[40]) it had sought to pass along to customers represented uninsured costs.[45]"

        "content": "  Typhoon Gordon, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Goring, was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage and loss of life in the Philippines and Southern China in July 1989. Gordon developed into a tropical depression near the Northern Mariana Islands on July\u00a09 and quickly intensified as it tracked west-southwestward. On July\u00a013, the storm attained typhoon status and subsequently underwent a period of rapid intensification. By July\u00a015, the storm attained its peak strength as a Category\u00a05 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). After striking the northern Philippines, Gordon moved through the South China Sea and slowly weakened. On July\u00a018, the storm made landfall in southern China and was last noted the following day as it dissipated over land. Throughout Gordon's path from the Philippines to China, the storm caused widespread damage and loss of life. Across the Philippines, 90 people were killed by the typhoon and an estimated 120,000 people were left homeless. Though a weaker storm when it struck China, damage was more severe due to extensive flooding. Several coastal cities were completely inundated. Throughout the country, at least 200 people died and losses reached 1.2\u00a0billion yuan ($319\u00a0million USD).[nb 1] Additionally, 14 people drowned offshore and 2 others died in Hong Kong."

        "content": "In early July, widespread showers and thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific underneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July\u00a09, a single cumulonimbus cloud west of Wake Island became associated with the TUTT and quickly organized. By July\u00a011, the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W.[nb 2] Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320\u00a0km (200\u00a0mi) east of the Northern Mariana Islands. The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone; and second, it became tropical while situated underneath a cold-core low.[2] Following the system's classification as a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained a west-southwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north. On July\u00a012, it is estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Gordon by the JTWC.[2] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Goring.[3] During the afternoon of July\u00a013, Gordon briefly turned southwestward as it attained typhoon status before returning to a more westerly track later that day.[2] As the TUTT gradually warmed, Gordon was able to undergo a prolonged period of rapid intensification, despite having restricted outflow. Over a 30-hour period from July\u00a014 to 15, the storm's central pressure decreased by 70\u00a0mbar (hPa; 2.07\u00a0inHg), just below the threshold for explosive intensification. At the end of this phase, Gordon attained its peak strength as a Category\u00a05 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[2] Around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915 mbar (hPa; 27.02\u00a0inHg).[4][nb 3] Once classified a super typhoon, Gordon acquired a slight northerly component to its track and maintained a general west-northwestward trajectory for the remainder of its existence. Late on July\u00a015, Gordon made landfall in northern Luzon, Philippines, at peak intensity. Remaining over land for several hours, the storm quickly weakened before entering the South China Sea. The system maintained minimal typhoon status as it developed a large, ragged eye by July\u00a017. Slight weakening took place hours before Gordon made landfall as a strong tropical storm near Zhanjiang in Southern China on July\u00a018. Briefly moving over the warm, shallow waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, Gordon's convective structure tripled in size; however, the system continued to weaken. Later that day, the storm made its final landfall in southern Guangxi Province. Once onshore, Gordon quickly weakened and was last noted on July\u00a019 by the JMA over southern Guangxi.[2][4]"

Torrential rains accompanying the storm, measured up to 747\u00a0mm (29.4\u00a0in) at Clark Air Base, caused widespread flooding and landslides.[2][8] Across Cagayan Valley, flash flooding prompted thousands of residents to evacuate to higher ground. Travel in much of the region was severely impaired as landslides blocked off roads.[9] Baguio was mostly isolated from surrounding areas as the main roads leading in and out of the city were blocked off.[10] In Paoay, a bridge was washed out and high winds from the typhoon tore the roof off a public market.[11] According to the Philippine Red Cross, nearly 11,000 people were in evacuation shelters by the evening of July\u00a016 in Ilocos Norte.[12] In La Union, three towns were submerged in flood waters up to rooftops of homes after a river burst its banks.[13] Throughout the country, 90 fatalities resulted from the typhoon. Additionally, 386 people were injured while another 3 were listed as missing. A total of 8,845 homes were destroyed and another 46,269 sustained damage.[3] An estimated 120,000 people were left homeless due to Gordon.[2] Losses from the typhoon amounted to 1.36\u00a0billion pesos (US$62\u00a0million).[3][14] By July\u00a018, relief operations began across northern Luzon.[15] Philippine President Corazon Aquino declared a state of calamity for five provinces and three towns by this time.[16]"

Thousands of people were evacuated from low-lying areas along the coast. Approximately 11,000 Vietnamese boat people were also moved to emergency shelters.[20] Winds up to 192\u00a0km/h (119\u00a0mph) battered parts of Hong Kong, downing numerous trees, snapping power poles and blowing out windows.[19] Driven by the intense winds, airborne debris injured 31, 6 of whom required hospitalization.[21] Two fatalities took place in the territory: one on Lantau Island and another in Tai O. Some flooding took place as a result of Gordon, especially along coastal areas where the typhoon brought a storm surge of 1.36\u00a0m (4.5\u00a0ft).[19] In Macao, high winds from the typhoon uprooted trees and broke windows. Flooding triggered by Gordon's heavy rains stranded cars and inundated stores.

The base became part of the vast US Naval Base Marshall Islands. At the end of WW\u00a0II, Ebon Atoll became a part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands under the control of the United States, until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986.

At the 2021 census, the atoll had a population of 469 people.[9] The same report also notes that Ebon is among the atolls and islands of the Marshalls with a positive net migration rate \u2013 even though the population has gone down with 196\u00a0people since the 1999 census. It is also curious to note that various German sources claim a significantly higher population \u2013 ranging from 1,000 to 2,000\u00a0people \u2013 in a 46-year period, 1860\u20131906. Moreover, in an unpublished interview series with Leonard Mason in 1949\u20131950, Dwight Heine (an Ebon local) tells of a legendary typhoon that swept Ebon sometime in the 1850s, the aftermath of which left the atoll population decimated.[10][a] Before the typhoon hit, Heine says, the Ebon population numbered several thousand. Today, people permanently inhabit four of the islets on the atoll. The main island, Ebon [Epoon], houses a medical facility and the council house, and has the largest population. T\u014dk\u0101 has fewer residents but is more densely populated than Ebon. The other two are Enekoion [\u0100ne-ko-ion] and Enilok [\u0100ni-look]. Of the four, \u0100ni-look is the only one without an elementary school, so children usually move to family members on T\u014dk\u0101 during school years. Many people have land rights on other islets and live there sporadically to work with copra production.

Being situated in the mountains, it has been isolated for most of its history from the rest of the country, making its local culture and language, known as Wenzhounese, particularly distinct, even from its direct neighbours. The city is also the native land of many emigrants to Europe and the United States, with many Wenzhounese immigrants abroad becoming entrepreneurs, restaurateurs, and retail and wholesale businesspeople in their adopted countries.[7] Wenzhou people make up a large proportion of the Chinese residents in Italy, constituting approximately 90% of Tuscany's Chinese population.[8] Significant concentrations of Wenzhounese also live in New York City, as well as across France and Spain.[9]"

There are some coastal plains, notably around the mouth of the Ou (where the city proper of Wenzhou is located), the Nanxi River, a tributary of the Ou, and further south, around the mouth of the Feiyun River (in Rui'an, a county-level city). Coastal plains are used intensively for agriculture but also host much of the population and industry. The 339 kilometres (211\u00a0mi) long coastline gives the city abundant marine resources and has many islands.[citation needed] Dongtou, one of the districts in Wenzhou, has also been called the \"County of One Hundred Islands.\" Dongtou County was renamed as Dongtou District in September 2015 following the State Council-sanctioned administrative region adjustments. Wenzhou boasts wonderful landscapes with rugged mountains and tranquil waters, including three state-level scenic spots, namely the Yandang Mountains, the Nanxi River and the Baizhangji Fall-Feiyun Lake, and two national nature reserves, the Wuyanling Ridge and the Nanji Islands. Yandang Mountain has been named as a World Geopark, while the Nanji Islands are listed a UNESCO Marine Nature Reserve of World Biosphere Reserves. Scenic areas account for 25% of the city's land space."

From the 1990s, low-voltage electric appliances manufacturing became one of the major industries in Wenzhou, with some of the large private enterprises setting up joint ventures with GE and Schneider. In 1994, exploration for oil and natural gas commenced in the East China Sea 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) off the coast of Wenzhou. Companies such as Texaco, Chevron, Shell and JAPEX have started to drill for oil but the operations have been largely unsuccessful. Wenzhou is a city full of vibrant business activities. When China began economic reforms in 1978, Wenzhou was the first city in China to set up individual and private enterprises as well as shareholder cooperatives. It has also taken the lead in carrying out financial system reform and structural reform in townships. Being a pioneer in utilizing marketing mechanism to develop urban constructions, Wenzhou has won a number of firsts in China and set many national records. From 1978 through 2016, the GDP of Wenzhou, a third-tier city in China, has increased from 1.32 billion RMB to 504.54 billion RMB with the gross fiscal revenue increasing from 0.135 billion RMB to 72.4 billion RMB, and the disposable net per capita income for rural residents increasing from 113.5 RMB to 22,985 RMB.

The Local cluster comprised 400 manufacturers in 2001 with a total output of 5 billion Yuan, representing 65 percent of the domestic market share. The cluster is the first in China in terms of market share and sold it products to 60 countries.[28] There are many areas in which people of Wenzhou opened the first example of private economy in post-1949 China. For instance, Juneyao Airlines started in July 1991, which is the first private airline company in China. Jinwen Rail Way is also the first rail way company which is built with private capital."

Chiang Ching-kuo argued that the park should be built in Longtan District in Taoyuan considering the potential benefits that could be drawn from National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and future relationship between the military field and the park. However, Shu Shien-Siu argued that the park should be built in Hsinchu because what Taiwan and the park needed was creativity and private economic power that would stem from the people instead of the government and the military. Therefore, Siu said that it was not a wise decision to draw too much relation between the military and the science and industrial park.  Also, Longtan District was a relatively remote place as compared to Hsinchu and thus, the potential of the park would be greatly diminished if it were to be built in Longtan District. More importantly, Siu's decision made in 1976 is commonly praised today as he foresaw the right model of the park. Siu wanted the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park to be like Silicon Valley which is adjacent to Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley. Thinking differently from Chiang Ching-kuo, Siu saw the potential advantages and tremendous resources the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park could benefit from the National Tsing Hua University and National Chiao Tung University. Therefore, Siu determined to manage to build the park in Hsinchu, where both universities are located at. Today, Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park is commonly considered as the Silicon Valley of the Orient and the high-tech industry stands as the biggest contributor to Taiwan's economy."

        "content": "In 1961, Shu Shien-Siu founded the Department of Mathematics at National Tsing Hua University, one of the most prestigious universities in Taiwan. A year later in 1962, Siu founded the Summer Mathematics Conference, the first-ever mathematical conference in the history of Taiwan.[77] When Siu became the president of National Tsing Hua University in 1970, there were only 3 academic departments and no college on campus and the university only held a population of over 660 people including faculty members. In order to expand the size of the university and contribute to the growth of Taiwan, Siu organized to establish the college of engineering that consists of five departments and expanded the Institute of Nuclear Engineering and Science by transforming it into the college of nuclear science which consists of two departments and one institute. From 1971 to 1973, Siu managed to employ a total of 165 professors with doctoral degrees. Also, during his presidency, Siu carried out the 15-year strategic plan for the university and placed heavy emphasis on the construction of buildings on campus such as the Department of Chemistry, the auditorium, the gymnasium and dormitories for students and housing buildings for academic staff as Siu sought to increase the bond between the academic staff and the students.[77][78][79] By the time he left National Tsing Hua University in 1975, the university had a total of nine departments, three colleges, and 13 institutes with a student population of over 2200(including graduate students) and academic staff population of over 160. In 1975, after Siu's five years of presidency, National Tsing Hua University placed first in all three fields of Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry in Taiwan.[79] As Siu was deeply influenced by the Yongjia School of Thought when he grew up in Wenzhou, during his presidential career at the university, Siu placed heavy emphasis on the idea of practicality instead of the traditional Chinese belief of the importance of theory, and also made it clear that as students, the interaction with the society will always be more important than that within the campus. One of the most influential quotes of Siu is \"What we need the most are the practitioners, who directly involve, but not the theorists\" (\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u9700\u8981\u7684\u662f\u5b9e\u884c\u5bb6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7406\u8bba\u5bb6). That main idea held by Siu to build the university in its early stage of development is almost identical as one of the central philosophies of Yongjia School of Thought, the cultural gene of the city of Wenzhou. Such a unique form of philosophy of Siu would later be proven to have a tremendous impact on the school and Taiwan's history as today, National Tsing Hua University is known for its emphasis on practicality in Taiwan.[77][78][79]"

Geographic isolation and the immigration of Southern Min speakers from nearby Fujian have caused Wenzhounese to evolve into a very phonologically divergent hybrid difficult for outsiders to understand. As a result, even the adjacent Taizhou Wu variety has little mutual intelligibility with Wenzhounese. Conversely Wenzhouness itself has spread to the Chinese immigrant communities in the Flushing and Brooklyn Chinatowns of New York City. The esoteric Wenzhounese language is reputed to have been used during the Second Sino-Japanese War during wartime communication and in the Sino-Vietnamese War for programming military ciphers (code).[87][88] Due to its unique grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, the language is basically impossible for any non-local to understand.

In 2006, it was reported that between 15 and 20% of the city's population was Christian.[92] In 2012, according to official data the city's Christians were at least one million (about 11% of the 2010 population).[93] Because of its large concentration of Christians, the city has been dubbed the \"Jerusalem of the East\" or \"China's Jerusalem\" in some media reports.[89] In recent years, the prominence of Wenzhou's Christian community has made it the target of some controversial government action. In 2014 CNN reported that local Communist Party authorities had demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than 300 church crosses.[94] More recent reports have updated the numbers to over 200 churches destroyed and 2,000 crosses removed.[95] The Chinese government denies that the demolition of churches constitutes persecution of Christians, pointing instead to violations of land-use regulations as the reason for its actions. However, independent human rights groups and news agencies have met this denial with skepticism.[96] The New York Times, for example, reported that internal government documents the newspaper had obtained revealed that these demolitions represented part of a deliberate strategy to reduce the public profile of Christianity in the region. Specifically, the Times cites a nine-page statement of provincial policy, singling-out the Christian community as targets for the regulation of \"excessive religious sites\" and \"overly popular\" religious activities. \"The priority,\" the document states, \"is to remove crosses at religious activity sites on both sides of expressways, national highways and provincial highways,\" as well as to, \"Over time and in batches, bring down the crosses from the rooftops to the facade of the buildings.\"[97] The provincial policy has met with some resistance.

All of them have exerted significant influence in the history of Chinese philosophy, literature and science. Wenzhou is also the origin of China's landscape poetry, the founder of which, Xie Lingyun, was the chief of Wenzhou's Yongjia Prefecture in the Northern and Southern dynasties period. In Song Dynasty, there were 4 distinguished poets from Yongjia representing the River and Lake Poetry. Moreover, Wenzhou is the birthplace of Nan Drama of China, which is the origin of Chinese traditional drama of which includes drama forms such as Peking Opera and Yue Opera.[104] \"The Romance of a Hairpin\", a tale about Wang Shipeng and Qian Yulian, is well known among locals and serves an inspiration for many who have endured life pains but still have faith in love.  For instance, \"Tale of Lute\", a play by Gao Zecheng of Ming Dynasty, is renowned abroad as one of the most outstanding works of Chinese drama along with Kun Opera of Yongjia which is recognized as the verbal and non-material human heritage. Dancing in public is also part of the Wenzhou culture.  Wenzhou, the birthplace of China's private economy, likewise is the birthplace of China's export-oriented industrialization. From the Southern Song Dynasty, in contrasted to the Confucianism represented by Zhu Xi and Lu Jiuyuan in China urging people to study to be officials in the future, the theory of Wenzhou's Yongjia School represented by Ye Shi, emphasized the importance of business. The theory has an enduring impact on the mindset of Wenzhou natives and has become the \"cultural gene\" in the economic development of Wenzhou ever since."

Numerous books have been published about the business sense of people from Wenzhou. Hence, when China switched from its planned economy to its so-called capitalist economy with Chinese (socialist) characteristics in the late 1980s, its people adjusted well to the new system and took advantage of it. A popular common saying calls Wenzhounese the \"Jews of the Orient\" (\u4e1c\u65b9\u7684\u72b9\u592a\u4eba).[citation needed] Wenzhounese have been stereotyped by other Chinese[which?] as real estate speculators.

Trail Ridge Road, the popular section of U.S. Route 34 through Rocky Mountain National Park was closed for many days due to the proximity of the fire and the potential for low visibility and heavy smoke.[19][18] The subsequent snowstorm dropped 6-14 inches of snow on the fire, but only temporarily halted the spread.[17] For the next week after the initial fire explosion, cooler temperatures and moisture kept the fire suppressed, leading to firefighters expanding containment on the fire to 15%, mostly on the western edge of the fire.[20] Air tankers and helicopters were continuing to drop fire slurry and water on hot spots and fire lines in preparation for warmer temperatures and lower humidity. Red flag warnings were in effect for most of Colorado's Front Range the following week as the fire grew another 8,000 acres to the east, subsequently grounding aircraft from fighting the fire.[21] On the evening of September 27, wind gusts over 60 miles per hour pushed the fire northeast and southeast another 13,000 acres, resulting in mandatory evacuations reaching through the Highway 14 corridor once again, and many campsites on the northern end of Rocky Mountain National Park.[22] Air quality alerts went into effect for many cities being affected by the wildfire smoke.[23] By the end of September, the fire had burned 125,006 acres (195 sq. mi.) and containment hovered around 30%. Firefighters were concentrating their efforts on the north side of the fire as to protect structures in the areas surrounding Kinikinik.

[30] An air quality alert was put into effect on the evening of October 18. [23] Over the six day period of growth between October 13 and 18, the fire gained 68,000 acres to the east and southeast and was now encroaching on the north end of Estes Park and was only eight miles west of Horsetooth Reservoir in Fort Collins and four miles northwest of the Loveland city limits.[4] By October 19, the Larimer County Sheriffs Office had confirmed that at least 100 structures had burned within the fire limits.[31] Due to the proximity to the East Troublesome Fire during firefighting efforts, and the spot of another fire near Estes Park, the Cameron Peak Fire Incident Management Team took control of the fire, dubbed the \"Thompson Zone.\"[2] The \"Thompson Zone\" portion of the East Troublesome fire eventually led to the evacuation of the entire town of Estes Park on October 22.[2] Many residents of Estes Park posted pictures to social media showing pitch black skies due to the intense smoke from the fire, also showing the long lines of vehicles trying to flee town.[32] The Cameron Peak Fire Incident Management Team held control of the \"Thompson Zone\" portion of the East Troublesome fire until officials could get the fire under control and re-assume control.[2] Cooler temperatures and snowstorms helped firefighters regain control of the blaze over the final week of October, allowing for helicopters and air tankers to do water and slurry drops in affected areas.[4] By the end of the month, the fire had burned 208,663 acres (326 sq mi.) and had forced the evacuation of over 16,000 people in various mountain communities, including the evacuation of the entire town of Estes Park, Grand Lake and portions of Granby.[33] Firefighters were aided by snowstorms and cool temperatures for the remainder of the month and containment had increased to 64%. Fire officials assessed containment lines on the east perimeter of the fire near Masonville and Horsetooth Mountain for the following weeks.[34]"

Containment was increased to 85% on the same day.[36] By the following day, fire crews were concentrating on repairing dozer lines and continuing containment for the fire on all edges.[37] The Cameron Peak fire was declared 100% contained on December 2, 112 days after igniting. Firefighters decided to let the last remaining portion of the fire, contained to a small pond where it was still smoldering underneath the soil, burn out northwest of the Colorado State University Mountain Campus[38]"

The wildfire burned concurrently with the East Troublesome Fire near Kremmling, Colorado, torching a combined 400,000 acres.[2] At its peak, the fire had over 1,000 personnel fighting it, with multiple helicopters and air tankers providing water and slurry drops. The fire closed 2 million acres of land in Rocky Mountain National Park, Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests.[39] The fire led to over 20,000 people being evacuated throughout mountain communities west of Fort Collins and Loveland. On November 6, the Larimer County Damage Assessment Teams (DAT) completed their report of all known structure damage due to the fire, and found that a total of 469 structures had been destroyed by the fire, including 224 residential structures and 220 outbuildings. There were 17 business structures from the Shambhala Mountain Center that were impacted by the fire, and 42 of the residential structures impacted by the fire were primary residences, mostly in the Redstone Canyon area.[2] Most of the worst damage from the fire occurred on three separate occasions and impacted various communities. Damage from the Labor Day weekend expansion occurred in Poudre Canyon south of Highway 14 near Archer\u2019s Poudre River Resort and the Monument Gulch area.[2] Damage from the weekend expansion of September 26 and 28 occurred in or near Poudre Canyon between the Fish Hatchery and Rustic, the Manhattan Road area, and the Boy Scout Ranch Road area and damage from the October 14 expansion occurred in or near Upper and Lower Buckhorn areas, Crystal Mountain, Bobcat Ridge, Buckskin Heights, Redstone Canyon, Storm Mountain, The Retreat, and Pingree Park.[2] Over the duration of the fire, it was controlled by 10 different incident command teams, including six Type 2, three Type 1 and one Type 3 team.[2] The fire's rapid spread was contributed by extreme temperatures, low humidity and heavy winds over the 112 days it was fought.[2] Wind gusts over the fire topped out at 80 miles per hour in September and October on multiple occasions, moving the fire in all directions.[2] One of the biggest contributing factors to the fires large spread was the large amount of beetle kill trees and many drought-stricken trees within the burn area.[2] Many ponderosa pines, Engelmann spruce, and mixed conifers added fuel to the fire's growth through the mountains.[2] The contribution of beetle kill, drought and harsh terrain made it difficult for firefighters to safely attack the fire.[2] Heavy winds made it hard to get aircraft into the fire zone to attack the fire, being grounded on numerous occasions due to red flag conditions across Colorado.[2] Firefighters worked on protecting homes threatened by the fire with heavy equipment and built fire lines.[2]"

The Cameron Peak fire cost over $132 million to fight and contain, with market property loss estimated at $6.3 million, and total structure loss estimated near $100 million.[39][40] The fire exacerbated already exhausted business dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, setting back business owners in mountain towns by thousands, some over tens of thousands.[41] A survey sent out to 700 businesses by the Estes Park Economic Development Group yielded 88 replies, stating that 83% of business owners suffered some sort of economic impact due to the fires.[41] Colorado Congressman Joe Neguse pushed for wildfire relief in a COVID-19 stimulus package.[42] A letter written to Democratic and Republican law makers in the House of Representatives and Senate calls for cash for cities to keep firefighters on payroll, payment of resources, investments of risk-mitigation systems, federal support for late-season hotshot crews and other federal-level fire response efforts, local-level recovery efforts to revitalize the health of the environment, water quality and community economies after wildfires.[42] On March 11, President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which will send aid to Americans struggling from the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill will provide funding for keeping first responders on payroll, especially in communities that were stretched thin the last 12 months.[43] The state of Colorado will receive $6 billion with Larimer County receiving $69 million.[43] Within the county, the city of Fort Collins is expected to receive $27.5 million in funding, followed by Loveland at $9.5 million, Berthoud at $1.9 million and Estes Park at $1.3 million.[43] On March 21, Colorado governor Jared Polis signed two bills aimed at helping provide wildfire response and management for the future.[44] The first bill will provide $30.8 million to support the purchase of a Firehawk helicopter for wildfire mitigation and the leasing of a type 1 helicopter or other available and appropriate aviation source that is configured for wildfire mitigation.[44] The bill will also allow for the Division of Fire Prevention and Control to use money from the Wildfire Emergency Preparedness Fund to provide wildfire suppression assistance to local agencies across Colorado.[44] The other bill will provide $13 million in forest restoration, wildfire risk mitigation, wildfire preparedness and post-fire recovery and mitigation efforts.[44]"

Many areas within the burn scar burned intensely and will take many years for the native Ponderosa Pines to regrow.[47] A proposed 387 acre tree thinning operation would clear Colorado's forests of trees that are fuel to burn during wildfires because of beetle kill and environmental factors.[48] Colorado has around 2.5 million trees dead from insects, diseases and lack of management.[48] Officials also project that winter weather will deposit ash and other debris from the fire into the rivers that feed into watersheds across the Colorado Rockies.[49] The potential for runoff from the fires polluting rivers poses a risk for aquatic life living within Colorado's rivers.[49] Native plant life is also currently listed at risk due to more invasive plants growing along the burn areas.[50] The United States Forest Service (USFS) released its Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) report on January 5, citing that the potential impacts on life and safety are considered \"major.\"[50] In the report, it was found that 36% within the 326 square miles of land the fire burned had suffered high soil burn severity, which poses a high risk of erosion or flooding due to the soil not being able to absorb moisture.[50] 44% of the burn area suffered low burn severity and 20% was left unburned.[50] The Forest Service predicts that while some areas will recover over the next several years, it could be a decade or longer before many of the higher burn areas recover fully.[50]"

Mesa County Rd. X 1/2 after High Lonesome Ranch were closed.[7] The fire continued to grow, threatening oil and gas drilling infrastructure. A temporary flight restriction was put in place for the fire area on August 4.[8] The fire began burning northwards onto Horse Mountain. Air quality began to decline and an Air Quality Health Advisory was put in place for northern Mesa County and southwestern Garfield County.[9] Within 36 hours the fire had grown to 11,846 acres (4,794\u00a0ha) by the evening of August 5.[10] Red Flag Warnings were put in place on the 6th and additional road closures were put in place. Smoke began to impact De Beque, Colorado and areas along Interstate 70.[11] Extremely low humidity, high temperatures and strong winds enabled the fire to grow to over 20,000 acres (8,094\u00a0ha) by the evening of August 7. The fire had moved down Forshay Gulch on the north side of Horse Mountain, before eventually spreading to Lion and Bledsaw Gulches and along 200 Rd.[12] The fires continued growth resulted in evacuation warnings being put in place for residents in rural, western Garfield County and a small group of homes were evacuated along County Roads 200 and 202.[13] On August 9, evacuations were put in place for more residences in the area.[14] A red flag warning was put into place on August 11 and the fire was seven percent contained. The fire began burning in closer to Roan Creek and on the south slope of Kimball Mountain.[15] Red flag winds pushed the fire over 50,000 acres (20,234\u00a0ha) on August 11.[16] On August 15, the fire burned onto Garfield Mesa and additional road closures were put in place. The air quality was impacted in Craig and Meeker.[17] The fire moved north of Fruita, resulting in more road closures. Air tankers began providing support, dumping retardant to slow the fire's spread.[18] On August 18, residents on a portion of Roan Creek Rd were allowed to return to their homes. An evacuation warning was put in place for areas of County Road 205, Kimball Mountain Rd and County Road 256. A thunderstorm moved through the western flank and caused wind gusts up to 40 MPH in near Echo Lake, resulting in firefighters having to evacuate the area due to the fire's erratic behavior and fast spread. This caused the fire to grow to an estimated 125,000 acres (50,586\u00a0ha).[19] This growth resulted in additional evacuation orders in Garfield County for residents east of Highway 139 and closures of 639,111 acres (258,639\u00a0ha) of BLM land north of Loma, Fruita, Grand Junction and Palisade.[20][21][22] By August 24, the Pine Gulch Fire was 44 percent contained.[23] Two days later, on August 26, Highway 139 reopened.[24] The next day, suppression repair began. A flash flood warning was announced for the eastern portion of the fire due to forecasted thunderstorms. A small debris flow took place near Kimball Creek Rd.[25] On August 28, the fire had burned 139,006 acres (56,254\u00a0ha) and was named the largest wildfire in Colorado history.

Damage between Pleasant Grove and McDonald Chapel indicated that trees were felled in a single direction, so the damage was not listed as tornadic at first, but was considered part of the tornado in posthumous analysis.[1] Next, the tornado struck McDonald Chapel, with a path 200 yards (183\u00a0m) wide, devastating the community.[4] Almost total destruction occurred in a swath 150\u2013200 yards (137\u2013183\u00a0m) wide. As it passed through McDonald Chapel, eyewitnesses described the tornado funnel as appearing filled with fire and smoke.[1] Many homes in McDonald Chapel were leveled, several of which were swept completely away. The most intense damage appeared to be F5 in intensity, but an F4 rating was rewarded because the homes were very poorly constructed.[4] One of the homes reportedly had almost all of its brick foundation swept away,[1] and a few larger homes were also leveled.[4] The tornado continued across parts of Edgewater, Pratt City, Fultondale, Village Creek, and Tarrant before lifting northwest of Trussville, near the Jefferson-St. Clair County line.[1] The tornado passed just one to two miles north of downtown Birmingham as well as the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. About 400 homes across northern Jefferson County were either damaged or destroyed.[4] Most of the 25 deaths occurred at McDonald Chapel.[1] The tornado event was similar to other deadly tornadoes on April 4, 1977, April 8, 1998, and April 27, 2011. The 1977 and 1998 tornadoes were rated F5, and killed 22 and 32 people, respectively, across most of the same areas that were hit in 1956. The 2011 event was rated high-end EF4, and killed 20 people in the area along with 44 others in Tuscaloosa earlier along its path. With 25 fatalities, the McDonald Chapel F4 was the deadliest tornado of 1956, surpassing the Grand Rapids F5 that killed 18 people on April 3."

It was the first fire known to have burned across the crest of the Sierra Nevada (followed by the Caldor Fire later in the season).[10][11] Smoke from the Dixie Fire caused unhealthy air quality across the Western United States,[12] including states as far east as Utah and Colorado.[13][14][15] The Dixie Fire was the most expensive wildfire (measured by cost of the firefighting effort) in United States history, costing $637.4 million to suppress.[16]"

        "header": "Background",
        "content": "A number of factors contributed to the size and intensity of the Dixie Fire. 2021 was the hottest summer ever recorded in California.[17] That year also saw further intensification of what scientists have found to be the most extreme megadrought in at least 1,200 years in the Western/Southwestern United States, amplified by high temperatures, low precipitation, and anthropogenic climate change: during the 2021 water year (the period between October 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021), Northern California received less than half of its usual precipitation.[18][19][20] The Sierra snowpack, measured during its typical peak on April 1, was just 59 percent of the historical average, and runoff just 20 percent of the amount forecast.[18] Reservoirs in the state shrunk, and vegetation dried out to the point where both living and dead conifers were drier than kiln-dried lumber.[21] Rigorous fire suppression policies in the United States also meant that much of the area burned by the Dixie Fire had little fire history, going back more than 40 years.[22] The resulting overcrowded forests became more vulnerable to drought, as well as bark beetle infestations that were the primary cause of death for more than 163 million trees in California between 2010 and 2019.[23]  Bark beetle-affected forests (especially species common in the Sierra Nevada such as the lodgepole pine) are chemically altered, and the dead and dying trees are more flammable and more susceptible to intense crown fires.[24]"

        "header": "Ignition",
        "content": "The Dixie Fire began on July 13, 2021, beneath a Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) 12-kilovolt power distribution line located on the northern side of the Feather River Canyon in a remote area above Highway 70 and Cresta Dam, midway between Paradise and Belden.[25][26] Transmission lines (also operated by PG&E) further down the canyon were the cause of the devastating and fatal Camp Fire in 2018.[27] At approximately 6:48\u00a0a.m. PDT a large Douglas fir, 65 feet (20\u00a0m) tall and 16 inches (41\u00a0cm) in diameter, fell onto the power line. Why the tree fell is unknown\u2014an arborist with Cal Fire said the tree was weakened after burning in the 2008 Butte Lightning Complex,[25] while another arborist hired by PG&E noted possible root rot.[28] When the tree fell onto the line, two fuses blew but one remained active, keeping the power line energized. The tree, in contact with both the line and the ground, created an electrical fault. Electric arcing slowly ignited fuels on the ground over the following hours.[25] At 1:30\u00a0p.m., a PG&E troubleman (a type of lineworker) came to address the resulting power outage. Access roads were in poor condition, and the troubleman was forced to stop at a bridge undergoing repairs. The troubleman left and returned at approximately 4:30\u00a0p.m., arriving at the power lines 10 minutes later. Noticing the two blown fuses, the troubleman was in the process of shutting off the third when he smelled smoke\u2014looking down, he observed a fire approximately 600\u2013800 square feet (56\u201374\u00a0m2) in size, burning among pine needles beneath the powerlines. The troubleman shut off the third fuse, then took a fire extinguisher from his truck and unsuccessfully attempted to put the fire out. He was able to raise his supervisor by radio, who called 911. In the meantime, the troubleman returned to the fire with another fire extinguisher and a McLeod tool, attempting to rake and dig a firebreak.[25][29] As the fire became visible from Highway 70 on the opposite side of the Feather River Canyon, it prompted multiple reports to 911. A fire engine strike team leader returning home from the Beckwourth Complex called 911 at roughly 5:12\u00a0p.m., reporting a well-established fire about 40 by 40 feet (12\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a012\u00a0m).[25][29] By 5:15\u00a0p.m., the Oroville emergency command center had dispatched a full wildland response, including six fire engines, two bulldozers, two handcrews, two water tenders, two airtankers, and a helicopter. Aircraft were overhead by 5:42\u00a0p.m., reporting that the now-named Dixie Fire was two acres (0.81\u00a0ha) with a slow rate of spread.[25][29] Air tankers promptly began to drop fire retardant\u2014more than 7,000 gallons over the course of the evening\u2014and helicopters scooped water from the Feather River below.[30] By 6:31\u00a0p.m., aircraft had completed a line of retardant around the entire perimeter and the fire remained two acres (0.81\u00a0ha). Ground personnel, however, faced the same access issues that had plagued the PG&E troubleman, including the damaged bridge and rough dirt roads.[25][29] At 7:49\u00a0p.m. a drone was reported in the vicinity of the fire, and all aircraft were ordered to leave the area. Because it was so late and regulations generally do not permit firefighting aircraft to fly in the dark, air operations were not able to resume that night. The drone's appearance meant about 45 minutes of flying time was lost, which Butte County district attorney Mike Ramsey said played a large role in the fire escaping control. The drone's operator was never identified, despite a multi-agency investigation that involved state and local agencies, the FAA and the FBI.[31][25][29] With aircraft no longer able to help, limited ground access, and the fire exposed to nightly up-canyon winds, the Dixie Fire began to grow considerably.[25]"

By July 19 it had burned 40,500 acres (16,400\u00a0ha); over the next two days, the fire more than doubled in size to 85,000 acres (34,000\u00a0ha), driven by high winds.[33] As of July 21, the fire was 15 percent contained, with nearly 4,000 firefighters and numerous aircraft assigned to the incident.[34] By July 23, flames had traveled north almost to Highway 89 and Lake Almanor, after jumping over Butte Valley Reservoir. On the east flank, the fire was advancing toward Bucks Lake and Indian Valley, and on the west, it was burning toward Butte Meadows. It had grown to 167,430 acres (67,760\u00a0ha) with 18 percent containment.[35] Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for Plumas, Butte, Lassen and Alpine counties due to the Dixie, Fly and Tamarack Fires.[36] By then, the Dixie Fire had become the largest wildfire of the year in California.[37] On July 24 the fire expanded rapidly east, burning through Paxton and then Indian Falls, destroying around a dozen structures.[38] Firefighters successfully kept the fire north of Bucks Lake, while flames approached the Indian Valley communities of Crescent Mills, Greenville and Taylorsville on the east. Later that night it merged with the smaller Fly Fire, which had started the previous day north of Quincy and burned over 4,300 acres (1,700\u00a0ha).[39] The Dixie Fire grew to 181,289 acres (73,365\u00a0ha) with 19 percent containment.[40] On July 30 the fire was at 240,595 acres (97,365\u00a0ha), becoming the 11th largest wildfire in California history, having grown 20,000 acres (8,100\u00a0ha) in a single day. However, much of the growth was due to islands of unburned vegetation within the fire perimeter, as well as back burning operations to protect homes in Butte Meadows and Jonesville.[41] Firefighters also contained the eastward spread of the fire with back burning from Mount Hough down to Quincy.[42]"

        "content": "At the start of August, the fire was most active on the north flank, having split into two main branches, with one burning up the western shore of Lake Almanor, and the other burning northeast toward Indian Valley. Fire activity was greatly decreased along the south side from Bucks Lake to Quincy, as well as the west side around Butte Meadows. Beginning on August 3, after several days of calmer weather, a major wind event drove the fire up the west shore of Lake Almanor, threatening Chester and other nearby communities. Firefighting efforts were concentrated on protecting the town, while the fire front continued sweeping north into Lassen County, the Lassen National Forest and the eastern side of Lassen Volcanic National Park.[44] On the evening of August 4, the northeast flank of the fire jumped containment lines at Indian Valley and burned through the town of Greenville. An estimated 75 percent of structures in Greenville were destroyed, including much of the downtown and numerous nearby homes. The firestorm was compared to \"a huge tornado\" and took less than half an hour to destroy the town before leaping to the other side of Indian Valley and continuing northeast towards Mountain Meadows Reservoir.[45] The whole Dixie Fire grew to over 320,000 acres (130,000\u00a0ha), an increase of 50,000 acres (20,000\u00a0ha) in two days, and was 35 percent contained. It became the sixth-largest wildfire in California history, surpassing the North Complex Fire that had burned nearby in 2020.[46][47] On August 5, the fire burned much of Canyondam as it approached the eastern shore of Lake Almanor.[48] By the morning of August 8, the fire had grown to 463,477 acres (187,562\u00a0ha), surpassing the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire to become the second largest fire in the state's history, with containment falling to 21 percent.[49][4] Starting on August 13 increased winds pushed flames primarily to the east. The northern section of the fire expanded around the north side of Lake Almanor, heading east and south and threatening Westwood.[50] The fire's eastern section, having burned past Indian Valley, continued to race east towards Antelope Lake.[citation needed] It became the first fire to ever cross from the west side of the Sierra Nevada to the valley floor on the east side.[10][11] In the evening of August 16, winds of up to 30\u00a0mph (48 kmh) drove embers from the Dixie Fire over the Diamond Mountains and into the Honey Lake Valley. A number of spot fires ignited south of Janesville and crossed Highway 395, destroying several homes.[51] This put areas south of Johnstonville under mandatory evacuation warning, including the town of Janesville. Continued southwest winds threatened to push the fire towards Susanville.[52] In Lassen National Park, the area burned within the park had doubled to 22,000 acres (8,900\u00a0ha), and firefighters were building line to protect Manzanita Lake and Old Station areas.[53] On August 18, the Dixie Fire merged with the Morgan Fire, which had been started by lightning August 12, near the south entrance of Lassen National Park. In addition to burning north into the park, the Morgan Fire had threatened the communities of Mineral and Mill Creek just to the south. The Morgan and Dixie fires were joined by a backfire set in order to reduce fuels adjacent to the two towns.[54] By the end of the day, the Dixie Fire had grown to over 635,000 acres (257,000\u00a0ha), an increase of more than 80,000 acres (32,000\u00a0ha) since August 15, with containment at 33 percent.[55][56] By August 22, the Dixie Fire approached Milford but crews were able to protect the structures and containment rose to 37 percent, the highest since the fire began. Growth of the fire slowed overnight due to increased humidity but overall weather conditions remained challenging.[57]"

        "content": "In late July and early August 2021, U.S. Forest Service investigators investigated a spree of wildland arson set by former university professor Gary Stephen Maynard in the vicinity of the Dixie Fire. Investigators connected Maynard to at least five fires, all of which were stopped at one acre (0.40\u00a0ha) or less and which did no serious damage. The Moon, Ranch, and Conard fires were set behind crews battling the Dixie Fire.[58] Prosecutors seeking to prevent Maynard's release while awaiting trial argued that the fires might have endangered those personnel, leaving them trapped between the Dixie Fire and Maynard's fires, had investigators not been tracking him.[59][60] On July 20, 2021, mountain bikers reported the Cascade Fire on the slopes of Mount Shasta. A responding Forest Service investigator encountered Maynard attempting to free his car from a rut on a dirt road nearby, and took a photo of the car and its tire tracks. The next day, investigators responding to the Everitt Fire in a nearby part of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest noted identical tire tracks. Both fires were determined to have been caused by arson; additionally, burnt newspaper and a match were found where Maynard's car had been stuck. After linking Maynard to the two fires via several other methods, including surveillance footage and his use of an EBT card, investigators received a warrant to track Maynard's phone and vehicle. On August 3, 2021, during a traffic stop in Susanville, a Forest Service agent placed a tracking device on Maynard's car. On August 5, the agents tailing Maynard discovered the roadside Moon Fire, in an area of the Lassen National Forest under an evacuation order for the fast-growing Dixie Fire. Maynard continued to camp in the forest despite emergency closure orders, and on August 7 agents discovered the Ranch and Conard fires burning near Maynard's campsite. Tracking data supported his presence at the scenes of ignition.[60] Maynard was arrested on August 7 by a California Highway Patrol officer, and indicted by a federal grand jury on November 18, 2021. Multiple people who encountered Maynard prior to his arrest and indictment expressed concerns about his mental state. Maynard's arrest, and that of Alexandra Souverneva a month later for starting the destructive Fawn Fire near Redding, prompted many to downplay the role of climate change and spread rumors and conspiracy theories about the causes of California wildfires.[61] On February 1, 2024, Maynard pled guilty to three charges of arson. He was scheduled to be sentenced May 9, 2024 and faced fines of up to $250,000 for each fire and up to 20 years in prison. Ultimately, he was sentenced to five years and three months in prison, three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $13,081 in restitution for the three counts of arson on federal property.[62]"

The eastern zone was mostly Plumas National Forest and the western zone was mostly Lassen Volcanic National Park and Lassen National Forest. The eastern zone extended to the escarpment south of Milford, where firefighters continued efforts to protect the town. By September 6, containment had reached 57 percent, but extreme fire activity continued and strong winds pushed the fire down off the escarpment to containment lines at the base of the slope.[63][64] By September 10, fire crews were \"mopping up\" heat near the fire's edge south of Milford. In the West Zone, winds pushed the fire to the northeast, threatening the communities of Hat Creek and Old Station.[65] Old Station was put under an evacuation order on September 8, and by the 10th, the fire had jumped containment lines and crossed Highway 44.[66]  Fire crews began using Union Pacific Railroad\u2019s fire train, which can deliver 30,000 gallons of water per load to fill water tenders.[65] On September 9 the weather became more favorable, especially in the West Zone, with calm winds, overnight temperatures down into the 30s, up to a quarter-inch of rain, and rising humidity resulting in minimal fire activity. Favorable conditions were expected to continue throughout the week.[67] As of September 13, the few remaining areas of persistent heat and flames were all within the interior of the burned area,[68] and containment had increased to 86 percent by September 16.[69] By September 18, the fire was 88 percent contained; firefighters reinforced containment lines and monitored/patrolled the fire for hot spots within the fire lines in advance of a red flag warning.[70] Rain and work by firefighters on September 19 kept fire activity within the existing perimeter, and the increase in reported acreage on that date reflected area burned within that perimeter.[71] On September 22, containment reached 95 percent and firefighters successfully completed containment around the last portion of uncontained fire in the Devil's Punchbowl area of the East Zone.[72] On October 1, Devil's Punchbowl was devoid of heat based on infrared data and InciWeb indicated a 94 percent overall containment for the Dixie Fire (East and West Zone).[73] The Dixie Fire resulted in the most expensive wildfire suppression effort in United States history, in part due to a reliance on contracted and higher-paid local and private firefighters. The final cost of containing the Dixie Fire came to $637.4 million, split between multiple agencies such as CAL FIRE and the U.S. Forest Service.[74][16]"

The Lassen County Health and Social Services Department later clarified that evacuees from all counties were welcome at Lassen College and the Lassen County Sheriff's Department promised to investigate the circumstances surrounding the removal of evacuees.[92] On July 24, Lassen National Park was closed to backcountry camping, and the Warner Valley and Juniper Lake areas were closed to all visitors.[93] On August 5, the entire park was closed to visitors as the Dixie Fire burned into the eastern side of the park.[45] As of August 2, State Routes 32, 89, 147, 36, and 70 were closed to through traffic in the area of the Dixie Fire.[94]"

Prosecutors agreed to the deal because of the minute criminal fines they could have extracted from the company (barely more than $300,000). Attorney General of California Rob Bonta declined to bring any legal action against PG&E.[101] On January 17, 2023, Shasta, Plumas, Lassen, Butte and Tehama counties and five other public entities impacted by the Dixie Fire announced that they had reached a $24 million settlement with PG&E. The settlement did not mark an admission of liability by PG&E, which stated that the purpose of the settlement was to avoid future litigation.[102] In October 2023 the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) proposed a $45 million fine for PG&E, comprising $2.5 million to be paid into California\u2019s general fund, $2.5 million to go to Native American tribes affected by the fire, and $40 million to be spent by PG&E on digitizing records (the company's neglect in transitioning records from paper to electronic had been held up as a factor in its failure to inspect power lines and hazardous trees). The commission was scheduled to vote on the proposed fine in November.[103] In late January 2024, PG&E fully agreed to the proposed $45 million settlement.[104]"

At the time, the Tubbs Fire was the most destructive wildfire in California history,[7][1] burning parts of Napa, Sonoma, and Lake counties, inflicting its greatest losses in the city of Santa Rosa. Its destructiveness was surpassed only a year later by the Camp Fire of 2018.[8] The Tubbs Fire was one of more than a dozen large fires that broke out in early October 2017, which were simultaneously burning in eight Northern California counties, in what was called the \"Northern California firestorm\".[9] By the time of its containment on October 31, the fire was estimated to have burned 36,810 acres (149\u00a0km2);[10][11] at least 22 people were believed to have been killed in Sonoma County by the fire.[12] The fire started near Tubbs Lane in the rural northern part of Calistoga, in Napa County. It destroyed more than 5,643 structures,[1][3][13] half of which were homes in Santa Rosa.[14] Santa Rosa's economic loss from the Tubbs Fire was estimated at $1.2\u00a0billion (2017 USD), with five percent of the city's housing stock destroyed.[4] The Tubbs Fire also incurred an additional $100\u00a0million in fire suppression costs.[5] After an investigation lasting over a year, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) determined that the Tubbs Fire was \"caused by a private electrical system adjacent to a residential structure\"[15] and that there had been no violations of the state's Public Resources Code.[16] However, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) later agreed to settle victims' claims as part of a general $13.5 billion bankruptcy plan involving liabilities from other wildfires, and also issued payments to Sonoma County and the city of Santa Rosa as part of a separate settlement with local governments.[17]"

In northern Santa Rosa, the peak wind gusts at 9:29\u00a0p.m. hit 30\u00a0mph; an hour later, they were 41\u00a0mph.[20] Pushed by strong winds from the northeast, the front of the fire moved more than twelve miles in its first three hours.[19] The Mark West Springs area, north of Santa Rosa in unincorporated Sonoma County, was directly in the path of the fire. Notably, over a thousand animals at the Safari West Wildlife Preserve remained unharmed, saved by owner Peter Lang, who, aged 76, single-handedly fought back the flames for more than 10 hours, using only garden hoses.[21][22] Sonoma County officials could have sent out an emergency alert to every cellphone in the region on Sunday night as the fire grew, but chose not to, saying such a widespread alarm would have hampered emergency efforts. Instead, location based SMS and email alerts were broadcast \u2013 the first of these text messages going out at 10:51\u00a0pm, using a system called SoCo Alerts to notify people via cellphone; both are limited to those who sign up for these services. Officials also used a reverse 911 system that called landlines in certain areas.[23] At 11:58\u00a0pm, firefighters called for an evacuation order encompassing the area between the cities of Calistoga and Santa Rosa.[24]"

The zone included several schools and the Oakmont Village retirement neighborhood.  Evacuations for the area were lifted by late the following Wednesday.

Fire officials searched for dangerous hot spots that could re-ignite the blaze, and utility workers began cleaning up the demolished neighborhoods.[55] Historical archives of Hewlett-Packard (consisting of over 100 boxes of documents from William Hewlett and David Packard, who had founded the company in Silicon Valley in 1938) were completely lost when two buildings on the Fountaingrove headquarters campus of Keysight Technologies were incinerated.[56] A former HP employee who had previously been in charge of the archives commented that \"a huge piece of American business history is gone\", and Keysight disputed criticism that the archives (which it had acquired at the time of its founding as a HP spin-off in 2014) had been inadequately protected.[56]"

New homes in the fire zones are required to meet building code requirements for fire-resistant materials for siding, roofing and decks, with protected eaves to keep out windblown embers.[77] Those measures made little difference in the Tubbs Fire. For example, despite a 100-foot fire break that ringed much of the Fountaingrove II subdivision, which consisted of 600 upscale homes in the same path as the Hanly Fire,[82] virtually the entire subdivision was destroyed by the Tubbs Fire.[83][84]"

The judge's ruling on this trial had important ramifications for how Tubbs Fire victims were to be compensated and the schedule for the bankruptcy.[97][98] On August 16, 2019, the judge ruled that the trial can proceed \"on a parallel track\" because \"it advances the goals of this bankruptcy.\"[99][100][101] By November 2019, this trial was scheduled to begin January 7, 2020 in San Francisco.[102] PG&E needed to get its bankruptcy plan approved by June 30, 2020 to be included in the fund for fire costs created by the new state law AB\u00a01054.[103][104][105][106] After the judge's ruling, the company's stock price sank by 25%.[107] On December 6, 2019, in an effort to avert the trial,[17] PG&E proposed to settle the wildfire victim claims for a total of $13.5\u00a0billion, which would cover liability for its responsibility originating from the Camp Fire, Butte Fire, and also a series of wildfires beginning on October 8, 2017, collectively called the 2017 North Bay Fires.[108] (The Tubbs Fire is considered to be one of the 2017 North Bay Fires.[109]) The offer was tendered as part of PG&E's plan to exit bankruptcy.[110] The court case was superseded by the PG&E Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) of December 9, 2019[111] and by the bankruptcy reorganization plan, wherein PG&E agreed to settle claims from the Tubbs Fire.[112] On July 1, 2020, the PG&E Fire Victim Trust (FVT) was established as part of the reorganization plan[113] of the 2019 bankruptcy of PG&E to administer the claims of the wildfire victims.[114][109] Also on July 1, PG&E funded the Fire Victim Trust (FVT) with $5.4 billion in cash and 22.19% of stock in the reorganized PG&E, which covers most of the obligations of its settlement for the wildfire victims.[115][116][117] As of June 2020, PG&E had two more payments totaling $1.35 billion in cash scheduled to be paid in January 2021 and January 2022, to complete its obligations to the wildfire victims.[118] In October 2020, on the third anniversary of the Tubbs Fire, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that as part of a separate $1 billion settlement with local governments, Sonoma County had received almost $150 million from PG&E and the city of Santa Rosa city had received $95 million, with officials \"facing tough decisions about how to spend all the money.\"[17] By that time, around 2,100 homes had been rebuilt, with more in progress.[17]"

The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in Japan, with other tropical cyclone warning centres for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii (the Joint Typhoon Warning Center), the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Although the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year.[4] Within most of the northwestern Pacific, there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are several main requirements for typhoon formation and development. It must be in sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the lower-to-middle levels of the troposphere, have enough Coriolis effect to develop a low pressure centre, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and a low vertical wind shear. Although the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms may occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is very rare during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of Japan. The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls, with China and Japan being less often impacted. However, some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives. Taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific tropical cyclone basins. However, Vietnam recognises its typhoon season as lasting from the beginning of June through to the end of November, with an average of four to six typhoons hitting the country annually.[5][6] According to the statistics of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, from 1950 to 2022, the Northwest Pacific generated an average of 26.5 named tropical cyclones each year, of which an average of 16.6 reached typhoon standard or above as defined by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.[7]"

        "content": "The etymology of typhoon is either Chinese or Persian-Hindustani origin. Typhoon may trace to \u98a8\u7661 (meaning \"winds which long last\"), first attested in 1124 in China. It was pronounced as [h\u0254\u014b ts\u02b0i] in Min Chinese at the time, but later evolved to [h\u0254\u014b t\u02b0ai]. New characters \u98a8\u98b1 were created to match the sound, no later than 1566.[8][9] The word was introduced to Mandarin Chinese in the inverted Mandarin order \u98b1\u98a8 [t\u02b0a\u026a f\u0264\u014b], later picked up by foreign sailors to appear as typhoon.[8] The usage of \u98b1\u98a8 was not dominant until Chu Coching, the head of meteorology of the national academy from 1929 to 1936, declared it to be the standard term.[10][11] There were 29 alternative terms for typhoon recorded in a chronicle in 1762, now mostly replaced by \u98b1\u98a8,[12] although \u98a8\u7661 or \u98a8\u98b1 continues to be used in Min Chinese- and Wu Chinese- speaking areas from Chaozhou, Guangdong to Taizhou, Zhejiang.[8] Some English linguists proposed the English word typhoon traced to the Cantonese pronunciation of \u98b1\u98a8 [t\u02b0\u0254i fu\u014b] (correspond to Mandarin [t\u02b0a\u026a f\u0264\u014b]), in turn the Cantonese word traced to Arabic.[13] This claim contradicts the fact that the Cantonese term for typhoon was \u98a8\u820a [fu\u014b k\u0250u] before the national promotion of \u98b1\u98a8.[8] \u98a8\u820a (meaning \"winds which long last\") was first attested in 280, being the oldest Chinese term for typhoon.[9] Not one Chinese historical record links \u98b1\u98a8 to an Arabic or foreign origin.[10][11] On the other hand, Chinese records consistently assert foreigners refer typhoon as \"black wind\".[10][11] \"Black wind\" eventually enters the vocabulary of Jin Chinese as \u9ed1\u8001\u98a8 [x\u0259\u0294 lo f\u0259\u014b].[14] Alternatively, some dictionaries propose that typhoon derived from (\u0637\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0646) t\u016bf\u0101n, meaning storm in Persian and Hindustani.[15][16] The root of (\u0637\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0646)  t\u016bf\u0101n possibly traces to the Ancient Greek mythological creature Typh\u00f4n.[16] In French typhon was attested as storm in 1504.[17] Portuguese traveler Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto referred to a tuf\u00e3o in his memoir published in 1614.[18] The earliest form in English was \"touffon\" (1588),[16] later as touffon, tuffon, tufon, tuffin, tuffoon, tayfun, tiffoon, typhawn.[10][11]"

Tropical storms also receive official names from RSMC Tokyo.[19] Should the storm intensify further and reach sustained wind speeds of 48 knots (55\u00a0mph; 89\u00a0km/h) then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm.[19] Once the system's maximum sustained winds reach wind speeds of 64 knots (74\u00a0mph; 119\u00a0km/h), the JMA will designate the tropical cyclone as a typhoon\u2014the highest category on its scale.[19] Since 2009 the Hong Kong Observatory has divided typhoons into three different classifications: typhoon, severe typhoon and super typhoon.[20] A typhoon has wind speed of 64\u201379 knots (73\u201391\u00a0mph; 118\u2013149\u00a0km/h), a severe typhoon has winds of at least 80 knots (92\u00a0mph; 150\u00a0km/h), and a super typhoon has winds of at least 100 knots (120\u00a0mph; 190\u00a0km/h).[20] The United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially classifies typhoons with wind speeds of at least 130\u00a0knots (67\u00a0m/s; 150\u00a0mph; 241\u00a0km/h)\u2014the equivalent of a strong Category\u00a04 storm in the Saffir-Simpson scale\u2014as super typhoons.[21] However, the maximum sustained wind speed measurements that the JTWC uses are based on a 1-minute averaging period, akin to the U.S.'s National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center. As a result, the JTWC's wind reports are higher than JMA's measurements, as the latter is based on a 10-minute averaging interval.[22]"

        "content": "There are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation, they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form. Normally, an ocean temperature of 26.5\u00a0\u00b0C (79.7\u00a0\u00b0F) spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) is considered the minimum to maintain the special mesocyclone that is the tropical cyclone. These warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems. A minimum distance of 500\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi) from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis.[23]\nWhether it be a depression in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon trough, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. About 85 to 90\u00a0percent of Pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough.[24] Even with perfect upper-level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Vertical wind shear of less than 10\u00a0m/s (20\u00a0kn, 33\u00a0ft/s) between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development.[23][25] Typically with Pacific typhoons, there are two jets of outflow: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the westerlies, and a second towards the equator.[24] In general, the westerly wind increases associated with the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins. As the oscillation propagates from west to east, it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season.[26] On average, twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western Pacific Ocean, near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south, along the same meridian, or line of longitude.[27] There is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the North Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other is normally quiet, and vice versa. The main reason for this appears to be the phase of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, or MJO, which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.[28]"

This makes this basin the most active on Earth.[30] Pacific typhoons have formed year-round, with peak months from August to October. The peak months correspond to that of the Atlantic hurricane seasons. Along with a high storm frequency, this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record. One of the most recent busy seasons was 2013. Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific Ocean and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian Ocean. The area just northeast of the Philippines is the most active place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist. Across the Philippines themselves, activity reaches a minimum in February, before increasing steadily through June and spiking from July through October, with September being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago. Activity falls off significantly in November, although Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest Philippine typhoon on record, was a November typhoon.[31] The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central Luzon and eastern Visayas.[32] A ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30\u00a0percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receive less than 10\u00a0percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones.[33] The genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency.[34]"

Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September\u2013November tropical cyclone impacts during El Ni\u00f1o and neutral years. During El Ni\u00f1o years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130\u00b0E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago.[37] During La Ni\u00f1a years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the subtropical ridge position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines.[37] Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to Jeju Island, Korea.[38] Typhoon paths follow three general directions.[30] A rare few storms, like Hurricane John, were redesignated as typhoons as they originated in the Eastern/Central Pacific and moved into the western Pacific."

In the Philippines, the most active season since 1945 for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993, when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country.[46] There was only one tropical cyclone that moved through the Philippines in 1958. The 2004 Pacific typhoon season was the busiest for Okinawa since 1957.[47] Within Guangdong in southern China, during the past thousand years, the most active decades for typhoon strikes were the 1660s and 1670s.[48] The highest reliably-estimated maximum sustained winds on record for a typhoon was that of Typhoon Haiyan at 314\u00a0km/h (195\u00a0mph) shortly before its landfall in the central Philippines on November 8, 2013.[49] The most intense storm based on minimum pressure was Typhoon Tip in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 1979, which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals (26\u00a0inHg) and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165\u00a0knots (85\u00a0m/s, 190\u00a0mph, 310\u00a0km/h).[50] The deadliest typhoon of the 20th century was Typhoon Nina, which killed nearly 100,000 in China in 1975 due to a flood that caused 12 reservoirs to fail.[51] After Typhoon Morakot landed in Taiwan at midnight on August 8, 2009, almost the entire southern region of Taiwan (Chiayi County/Chiayi City, Tainan County/Tainan City (now merged as Tainan), Kaohsiung County/Kaohsiung City (now merged as Kaohsiung), and Pingtung County) and parts of Taitung County and Nantou County were flooded by record-breaking heavy rain.

Throughout this time, the Kingdom of Lupah Sug had been established centuries before Islam arrived. The advent of Islam around 1138 through merchants and traders had a distinct influence on Southeast Asia. The coming of Arabs, Persians and other Muslims paved the way for the arrival of religious missionaries, traders, scholars and travelers to Sulu and Mindanao in the 12th century. A landmark born of the social process was the founding of the Sultanate of Sulu. Year 1380 CE, The Sunni Sufi Scholar Karim-ul Makhdum came to Sulu and introduced Islam to the Philippines. In 1450\u00a0CE, Johore-born Arab adventurer Sayyid Abubakar Abirin came to Sulu and lived with Rajah Baguinda Ali. The Sunni Sufi Teacher and Sayyid Abubakar eventually married Ali's daughter, Dayang-dayang Paramisuli, and inherited Rajah Baguinda's polity (which was a principality before), which he turned into the Sultanate of Sulu and become its first Sultan. To consolidate his rule, Sayyid Abubakar united the local political units under the umbrella of the Sultanate. A Sultanate that followed the Ash'ari Aqeeda, Shafi'i Madh'hab and Sufism. He brought Sulu, Zamboanga Peninsula, Palawan, and Basilan under its aegis."

The Sultanate of Sulu formally recognised Spanish sovereignty in Tawi-Tawi and Sulu in middle of 19th century, but these areas remained partially ruled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations, garrisons, and pockets of civilian settlements, until they had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish\u2013American War."

On August 20, Sultan Jamalul Kiram II and Brig. Gen. John C. Bates signed the Bates Agreement that continued the gradual emasculation of the Sultanate started by Spain (Treaty of 1878) until March 1915 when the Sultan abdicated his temporal powers in the Carpenter Agreement. The Agreement eliminated opposition to the civilian government of Gov. Clinton Solidum. The Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Gov. Carpenter was created by Philippine Commission Act 2309 (1914) and ended on February 5, 1920, by Act of Philippine Legislature No. 2878. The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes was organized and briefly headed by Teofisto Guingona Sr. With the enactment by the US Congress of the Jones Law (Philippine Autonomy Law) in 1916, ultimate Philippine independence was guaranteed and the Filipinization of public administration began. Sulu, however, had an appointed American governor until 1935, and the Governor General in Manila had a say in Sulu affairs. At any rate, the essence of local governance forged by Rajah Baguinda continued to permeate the ethos of Sulu politics despite centuries of colonial presence. History points to a local government in Sulu that antedates other similar systems in the country. The province hosted the Daru Jambangan (Palace of Flowers) which was the royal palace of the Sultan of Sulu since historical times. The palace, located in Maimbung was made of wood, and was destroyed in 1932 by a huge storm."

The Japanese were eventually expelled by the Americans and the natives of Sulu, and the Americans started to push for the independence of the Philippines as 'one country'. This prompted various leaders from Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago to campaign against being lumped with the Catholic natives of Luzon and the Visayas. Despite the campaign against the 'one Philippines model', the United States granted independence to the Philippines, effectively giving control of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago to the Filipino government in Manila. It was during this period that the fighting 21 of Sulu rose with Lt.Abdulrahim Imao and Sayyid Captain Kalingalan Caluang who distinguished himself through extraordinary valor and leadership, earning widespread recognition and commendation. The Fighting 21 of Sulu was narrated by Ernesto M. Espaldon in his book. Among Sayyid Captain Kalingalan Caluang's  notable accolades was the prestigious Bronze Star Medal, awarded on February 4, 1944, under Executive Order \u21169419 by the Commanding General of the 41st Infantry Division, for his meritorious achievements in the Sulu Archipelago, Philippine Islands.

During that time, the Mindanao sentiment to become a free country on its own was also felt in Sulu. In 1948, Hadji Kamlon, a World War II veteran, started an uprising on Luuk, Sulu. He surrendered in 1949 but started another uprising in 1952. He then surrendered on July 31, 1952, to Secretary of Defense Ramon Magsaysay. However, he started a third uprising a week later. He surrendered again on November 9, 1952, but would start another uprising in early 1953. He would then surrender on August 11, 1953, after an encounter with Philippines Government troops. He violated the terms of his surrender a week later. Two years later, on September 24, 1955, he would then surrender after an encounter with government troops in Tandu Panuan, Luuk.

Sulu is bordered by two seas; the Sulu Sea to the north, and the Celebes Sea to its south. Sulu has over 157 islets, some of which remain unnamed.[1] The islands are organized into four groups:[1]"

Although consisting of a mixed community of Muslims, the Tausugs dominate the Sulu Archipelago. The Tausug were among the first inhabitants of the Philippines to embrace Islam as a religion and a way of life. They are referred to as 'people of the current', reflective of their close ties to the sea."

A majority of Sulu's Muslim population practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, Chinese Muslim and Malaccan missionaries from the 14th Century onwards. Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan's stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a \"purer\" Islamic way of life and worship. A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam. The majority of Sulu Christians are Catholics.[1] They are under the jurisdiction of Archdiocese of Zamboanga through its suffragan Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo. Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and a number of other Protestant denominations. Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Christianity or Islam while retaining many of their Chinese beliefs."

The Bajau-Sama language is also spoken, as are the official languages of Filipino and English. Many locals and barter traders can speak Sabah Malay, while Chavacano is also spoken by Christian and Muslim locals who maintain contacts and trade with the mainland Zamboanga Peninsula and Basilan."

Its fertile soil and ideal climate can grow a variety of crops such as abaca, coconuts, Sulu coffee,[34] oranges, and lanzones as well as exotic fruits seldom found elsewhere in the country such as durian and mangosteen. Fishing is the most important industry since the Sulu Sea is one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. The province also has an extensive pearl industry, with a pearl farm on Marungas Island. The backs of sea turtles are made into beautiful trays and combs. During breaks from fishing, the people build boats and weave mats. Other industries include coffee processing and fruit preservation. The handicrafts of Sulu have both Islamic and Malay influences. Skilled artisans make boats, bladed weapons, bronze and brassware, pis cloth, embroidered textiles, shellcraft, traditional house carvings, and carved wooden grave markers. The province used to be one of the most prosperous in the southern Philippines. However, due to conflicts, terrorism, and the establishment of jihadists groups following Wahhabism such as the Abu Sayyaf, the province's economy has suffered badly and has been reduced to its current state."

However, its built-up (or metro) area is much bigger with 12,543,024 inhabitants including Rongcheng and Jiedong districts, Jiexi county and Puning city in Jieyang plus all of Chaozhou city largely conurbated. This is de facto the 5th built-up area in mainland China between Hangzhou-Shaoxing (13,035,026 inhabitants), Xi'an-Xianyang (12,283,922 inhabitants) and Tianjin (11,165,706 inhabitants). Shantou, a city significant in 19th-century Chinese history as one of the treaty ports established for Western trade and contact, was one of the original special economic zones of China established in the 1980s, but did not blossom in the manner that cities such as Shenzhen, Xiamen and Zhuhai did. However, it remains eastern Guangdong's economic centre, and is home to Shantou University, which is under the provincial Project 211 program in Guangdong."

        "content": "Shantou was a fishing village part of Tuojiang Du (\u9b80\u6c5f\u90fd), Jieyang County during the Song dynasty. It came to be known as Xialing (\u5ec8\u5dba) during the Yuan dynasty. In 1563, Shantou became a part of Chenghai County in Chao Prefecture (Chaozhou). As early as 1574, Shantou had been called Shashanping (\u6c99\u6c55\u576a). In the seventeenth century, a cannon platform called Shashantou Cannon (\u6c99\u6c55\u982d\u70ae\u81fa) was made here, and the place name later was shortened to \"Shantou\". Locally it has been referred to as Kialat. Connecting to Shantou across the Queshi Bridge is Queshi (\u7910\u77f3) which had been known by the local people through the 19th century as Kakchio. It was the main site for the American and British consulates. Today the area is a scenic park but some of the structures from its earlier history are somewhat preserved. In 1860, Shantou was opened for foreigners and became a trading port according to Treaty of Tientsin.[6] It became a city in 1919, and was separated from Chenghai in 1921. 1922 saw the devastating Swatow Typhoon, which killed 5,000 out of the 65,000 people then inhabiting the city.[7] Some nearby villages were totally destroyed.[8] Several ships near the coast were totally wrecked.[9] Other ones were blown as far as two miles inland.[8] The area around the city had around another 50,000 casualties.[9] The total death toll was above 60,000,[10] and may have been higher than 100,000.[9] In the 1930s, as a transport hub and a merchandise distribution centre in Southeast China, Shantou Port's cargo throughput ranked third in the country. A brief account of a visit to the city in English during this period is the English accountant Max Relton's A Man in the East: A Journey through French Indo-China (Michael Joseph Ltd., London, 1939). On 21 June 1939, Japanese troops invaded Shantou.[11] Japanese forces occupied Shantou until 15 August 1945.[12] The Communist People's Liberation Army captured Shantou on 24 October 1949, 23 days after the People's Republic of China was founded.[13] With higher-level administrative authority, Shantou governed Chaozhou City and Jieyang City from 1983 to 1989.[14]"

There has been a trend for the last three decades that shows an increase in the overall number of wildfires as well as the fire season length in the state of Oregon.[1] In 2017 Oregon experienced a total of 1,069 reported wildfires: with 779 human ignited and 290 ignited by lightning strikes.[2]  These fires burned a total area of 451,863 acres.[3] The catalyst for these fires was the abnormal weather patterns that persisted throughout 2017. Fire season typically begins in Oregon in May.[4] Fires burning through September 2017 led to the month being dubbed \"Smoketember\" in Oregon,[5] with air quality in western Oregon listed  from \"Unhealthy\" to \"Hazardous\" in early weeks. NASA published images of the Oregon, shown the typically green state to be highly obscured by smoke, as seen from space.[6] 2017 was unusual for the large number of fires occurring west of the Cascade Range in dense Douglas-fir forest in contrast to the frequent-fire pine ecosystems to the east. Large fires include the Chetco Bar Fire in Curry County, Oregon, and the Eagle Creek Fire in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, which was started by illegal fireworks use.[7] Fires in the Columbia River Gorge shut down Interstate 84, the state's major east\u2013west freeway, for several days in early September.[8]"

Between the dates of October 1, 2016, and April 26, 2017, Portland International Airport received 45.5 inches (116 centimeters) of rain. The month of February 2017 was the wettest February on record in Oregon with 10.36 inches (26 centimeters) of rain.[9] During the month of August, the weather station at Portland International Airport recorded a monthly average temperature of 73.6 degrees Fahrenheit (23.1 C) with the daily average temperature hitting 87 degrees Fahrenheit (30.5 C). The average temperature during the month of August 2017 was five degrees higher than the average August temperature recorded since 1941. It stands to be the second hottest August on record.[10] The extreme winter and summer weather that occurred in 2017 was met by some dangerous weather patterns in the late summer months. Early August through September in Southern Oregon saw several waves of thunderstorms. These storm systems brought rainfall which helped slow the growth of existing wildfires. However, the storms also brought lighting which resulted in the ignition of new fires. These storms travel on fast moving paths. After one these storms moves over an area, it quickly returns to a hot dry state. This allows for the newly ignited fires to spread quickly and develop into full wildfires.[11]"

Although temperatures will be higher, winters are expected to experience more rainfall.[12] These seasonal extremes are exactly the type of trends that were experienced in 2017. Climatic patterns such as these provide ample rainfall throughout the spring which allows for high rates of plant growth. The high temperatures in the summer then quickly dries up the new growth.  This leads to large spread availability of dry grasses and small diameter fuels. The combination of these climate driven phenomenon are what led to the extreme fire season in Oregon in 2017."

        "content": "Another problem plaguing Oregon in 2017 was invasive cheatgrass. This grass has its origins in Eurasia and has become a huge problem in Oregon. In burned areas this grass quickly replaces native vegetation such as sagebrush. Cheatgrass is especially dangerous in regards to wildfires because it is highly dependent on water and typically dries out a month before native Oregon grasses. The high rainfall in 2017 allowed cheatgrass to spread abundantly throughout eastern Oregon.  In areas that have cheatgrass, fire seasons have essentially been lengthened by a month due to the sooner availability of fuel.[13]  Due to its ability to both cause fires and repopulate burned areas cheatgrass is in a positive feedback loop of continual dispersal.[14]"

Up until this day, the crews were not using technology to gather acreage data, but estimates. As a precautionary response, the Rogue River \u2013 Siskiyou National Forest closed select forest service roads and trails.[4] As of August 2, the fire had expanded to 2,907 acres (12\u00a0km2). Fears of an upcoming heatwave led to the creation of public use restrictions on fires in the area.[5] By August 9, three additional trails were closed and on August 12, additional use restrictions were put in place regarding campfires and smoking.[6][7] On August 19, the fire, in Brookings effect wind, had spread 22,042 acres (89\u00a0km2) and the first mandatory evacuations were put in place - for the top of Gardner Ridge Road and Cate Road past Hazel Camp area, Wilson Creek area, and along the Chetco River 3 miles up the North Bank Chetco River Road from Social Security Bar to the Wilderness Retreat area.[citation needed][8] Another mandatory evacuation was put in place, on August 21, for areas between Highway 101 and Carpenterville Road, north to the Pistol River.[9] Six days later, on August 24, the fire had burned 102,333 acres (414\u00a0km2), burning in steep and rugged terrain about five miles north of Brookings, Oregon.[10] The smoke from the fire began impacting visibility along Highway 101 and creating dramatic hazes in Gold Beach and in Brookings.[11] By August 30, the National Guard had joined the fire fighting efforts.[12] Entering September, the fire continued to burn with mandatory evacuations being put in place all residents on Illinois River Road within US Forest Service Boundaries, including the Oak Flat community.[13] As of September 10, the fire was at 182,284 acres (738\u00a0km2) and was 5% contained. The fire had spread into Curry County.[1] In Josephine County, crews began structure assessments of the communities of O'Brien, Cave Junction, and Selma.[14] Governor Kate Brown, US Forest Service Chief Tony Tooke, Senator Ron Wyden, Major General Michael Stencel, and House Representative Peter DeFazio visited the fire camp.[15] The fire was announced as being 100% contained on November 2.[1]"

The Chetco Bar Fire damaged over 191,000 acres (773\u00a0km2) of land, the majority of which was US Forest Service land and private land. The fires burned 190 acres (1\u00a0km2) of redwood tree stands, with 6 acres (0\u00a0km2) being 75 to 100 percent completely destroyed.[16] BAER reported that the probability of damage and loss of soil resources is \"very high and high,\" due to the high soil burn severity in 1,621 acres (7\u00a0km2) and substantial loss of stored carbon, which serves as the long term nutrient supply for vegetation and microfauna. Geological hazards are also of concern, including rock falls, landslides, debris flows, slope failures, and soil erosion. Hillslopes have lost much of their overstory, ground cover, and roughness causing a decline in water storage, which increases the likelihood of flooding. Coho salmon habitats have seen increases in debris.[16] Regarding human risk, BAER reported concerns with roads and rivers, streams and creeks. 136 miles of roads received fire treatment, including debris removal and repairing water culverts. 18.5 miles of trails received fire treatment, primarily to assist with water drainage. Recreational sites saw signage placement for warning the public about safety concerns, tree removal, hazardous waste clean up and some properties have been closed. The highest concern recreation areas are SF Chetco, Mineral Hill Fork Creeks, Eagle Creek and Panther Creek.[16] Cultural values were found to be at risk after the fire, with heritage sites experiencing low to high intensity effects to the surrounding vegetation. Sites impacted include the Wheeler Ridge Japanese Bombing Site, the Quail Prairie Mountain Lookout and a prehistoric Native American site.[16] The Chetco Bar Fire's impacts on wildlife has been reported as \"high\" in the Eagle Creek area of the Chetco River. Forest wide, 26 nest patches of northern spotted owls were impacted with 85 percent sustaining moderate to high burn intensities. 37 percent of suitable marbled murrelet nesting habitat was burned at moderate to high severity.[16] BAER reported concerns with municipal water supplies in Brookings and Harbor, primarily with intakes experiencing channel scour during high peak flow events. Port of Brookings Harbor experienced increased debris and sediment during winter 2017.[16] It also impacted local viewing of the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017."

The fire broke out in Daxing'anling Prefecture, Heilongjiang on May 6, 1987.[1] It also spread into the Soviet Union.

In 1987, the area surrounding the Amur River in the region had been unusually hot and was experiencing a drought, leading to an overabundance of parched vegetation.[5][4] These conditions were ideal for a large wildfire to occur. Because the area was sparsely populated at the time, the exact cause of the fire was not very clear at first; any small ignition could have turned into a major firestorm in the conditions present. Later and widely believed Chinese reports state that the fire was started \"when an untrained 18-year-old worker accidentally ignited gas spilled from his brush cutter.\"[6] According to Harrison Salisbury, the roots of the disaster lay in excessive cutting down of trees without any effort to let the forest regrow, which triggered multiple fires in the region.[6] Whatever the causes were, the resulting firestorm quickly gained momentum, fueled by high winds in the region. Workers reported their truck engines stopping as the fire deprived the oxygen supply in the air as well as burning projectiles raining down on them ahead of the fire.[6] A total of 191 people were killed by the fire,[7] and a further 250 were left injured.[4] In addition, 33,000 Chinese were made homeless.[8] It remains the deadliest forest fire in the People's Republic of China."

China, despite its shortage of advanced firefighting equipment, sent over 60,000 soldiers and workers to try and extinguish the fire.[6] Because the forest was a major source of wood for China as well as the fact that it was close to the Gobi desert and thus a factor in desertification in northern China, China spent much effort on extinguishing the flames. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, simply let the fire burn out on its side of the border because its vast timber reserves were not seriously threatened by the fire.[4] When the fire finally stopped over a month later, the differences in responses were clear: The Soviet Union had lost more forest (15 million acres compared to 3 million in China), while China was more devastated economically.[3][5][6] In the aftermath, China punished individuals for causing the fire; the aforementioned 18-year-old worker, along with his employer, were jailed. The forestry minister was fired. In addition, a local fire chief who saved his house and left the rest of his town to burn was sentenced to four years in prison.[6] The lessons learned from the Black Dragon fire helped to improve response to wildfires throughout the world as well as demonstrate the impact that governments can have on the environment. The effect that the fire had on the environment in the region generated new found concern and speculation about the future about the forest's ecology.[3]"

        "content": "The tornado initially touched down along Old Gentilly Road to the east of the New Orleans Industrial Canal. EF0 damage was noted at the beginning of the path as homes sustained minor roof damage. EF1 damage occurred near Wilson Avenue as a two-story motel had much of its poorly attached roof uplifted and sustained buckling of exterior walls on the second floor. The tornado moved northeastward, attaining high-end EF2 intensity by the time it reached the Chef Menteur Highway (US 90). Metal power poles were bent, wooden power poles were snapped, a business was severely damaged, and an apartment complex sustained significant roof damage and collapse of a brick fascia exterior wall in this area. Damage surveys indicate that as the tornado continued on this northeastward track, it became multiple-vortex in structure, with a second circulation north of the first taking over as the predominant one. This second vortex, as the tornado did when it originally touched down, moved in a northeastward direction and produced EF2 damage near the Flake Street/Grant Avenue intersection. A small, poorly constructed home along Flake Street was rolled off of its cinder block foundation and completely destroyed, while nearby homes sustained shingle and porch damage. East of Crowder Boulevard, a continuous swath of mainly EF2 damage was noted as the now large and destructive tornado moved through residential areas, severely damaging numerous homes, many of which had their roofs ripped off. A few of these homes sustained some failure of exterior walls. Vehicles in this area were flipped and damaged, some of which were tossed into homes. On Arthur Drive and Charlene Drive, a small pocket of EF3 damage was noted as two homes lost most of their exterior walls, and had one or two of their interior walls collapse due to winds estimated by the NWS to have been around 140 miles per hour (230\u00a0km/h).[32] Along Grant Street, Schaumburg Elementary School sustained minor roof damage and broken windows as it was impacted by the outer edge of the circulation. Children inside the school took shelter in an interior hallway as the tornado struck and were not injured. Just east of this point, a large area of mid-range EF3 damage was observed. This damage was confined to an area along and just north of Grant Street between Read Boulevard and Chalmark Drive, where dozens of homes lost much to all of their roof structures and sustained collapse of multiple exterior walls. Large, two-story brick homes had only one or two interior corner walls left standing on their top floors, and a two-story apartment building sustained total roof loss and collapse of numerous second floor walls, with some collapse of first floor exterior walls noted as well. It was determined that the tornado reached peak its intensity in this area, with winds estimated at 150 miles per hour (240\u00a0km/h). The tornado then caused high-end EF2 damage further to the east as it moved through additional residential areas. Many homes in this area had roofs torn off and sustained some collapse of exterior walls. A second small area of mid-range EF3 damage was noted near Hauck Drive, where a large church was left with only one exterior wall standing, and sustained total collapse of most interior walls. Winds at this location were again estimated around 150 miles per hour (240\u00a0km/h).[31] The tornado essentially followed the Chef Menteur Highway as it continued eastward, significantly damaging homes and other structures at EF2 strength along this segment of the path. A small strip mall and a church sustained major roof damage and had every window blown out. A gas station was also heavily damaged and had its service station canopy shredded. Homes had their roofs completely removed, and many concrete light poles were snapped. A final segment of low-end EF3 damage occurred further east as several large metal power pylons along the highway were bent in half. High-end EF2 damage occurred in neighborhoods just north of the highway, as numerous homes sustained significant roof and exterior wall loss. Past Bullard Avenue, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and the damage path shifted southward. Numerous small trees were snapped near the I-510 and Almonaster Avenue interchange. The tornado then restrengthened to EF2 intensity as it caused heavy damage to NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility. Windows were blown out, and large metal industrial buildings sustained major structural damage. The large, two-story office building that houses the National Finance Center suffered significant roof damage and collapse of both the brick facade and cinder block exterior walls in a few places. Vehicles in the National Finance Center parking lot were severely damaged. The tornado then continued eastward across unpopulated marshy areas before dissipating over Lake Borgne.[31] In all, the tornado significantly damaged or destroyed at least 638 homes and 40 businesses along its 10.1-mile-long (16.3\u00a0km) path, and hundreds of trees and power poles were snapped. Thirty-three people were injured, six severely; however, no fatalities took place.[31] Two public schools\u2014 Schaumburg Elementary and Einstein Charter School\u2014both sustained some damage to buildings and property, with collective damage reaching $1.7\u00a0million.[33] NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility suffered more than $1\u00a0million in damage.[34] At the time, it was the strongest tornado to strike the New Orleans metropolitan area. However, it would be surpassed on March 22, 2022 by a high-end EF3 tornado, which killed one person and injured multiple others as it caused considerable damage in Arabi.[35][36]"

        "content": "  Typhoon Noul (pronounced [no.ul]), known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Dodong, was a relatively small but powerful tropical cyclone that affected several areas but caused minor damage. The sixth named storm and third typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Noul formed as a tropical depression over the eastern Caroline Islands on May\u00a02, 2015. It moved generally to the west and west-northwest, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm and later typhoon. On May\u00a09, Noul began rapid deepening as it developed a well-defined eye. Early the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated peak 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), while the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Noul struck northeastern Luzon in the Philippines at that intensity and greatly weakened. After passing east of Taiwan, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast and weakened due to unfavorable conditions. On May\u00a012, Noul became extratropical south of Japan, and the remnants continued to the northeast for several days, dissipating on May\u00a016. The typhoon first affected Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia, bringing  296\u00a0mm (11.65\u00a0in) of rainfall and causing about US$100,000 in damage. Noul forced 3,803\u00a0people to evacuate in the Philippines and stranded thousands others due to travel cancellations. Two people died while preparing for the storm. Its effects were limited to two provinces, amounting to \u20b116.3\u00a0million (US$366,000) in damage. Later, heavy rainfall in Taiwan helped ease water restrictions. The storm caused heavy crop damage in the Miyako District of Okinawa, totaling \u00a52.8\u00a0billion (US$23.3\u00a0million)."

        "content": "The origins of Noul were related to a strong westerly wind burst that also led to the formation of later Typhoon Dolphin.[1] By April\u00a030, 2015, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted and pulsed about 230\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Chuuk State within the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The system had a broad circulation amid an environment favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, including low to moderate wind shear.[2] The circulation slowly consolidated,[3] developing improved outflow and increasingly organized convection.[4] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a02, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression about 850\u00a0km (530\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Chuuk.[5] At 00:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 06W.[6] The nascent tropical cyclone moved northwestward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge.[7] Aided by decreasing wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the convection organized into a central dense overcast.[8] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a03, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Noul.[5] (Korean: \ub178\uc744; literally: afterglow, red sky)[9] The strengthening ridge turned the storm to the west toward the Philippines.[10] On May\u00a05, an eye developed in the center of the storm while Noul was near Yap State, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the storm to typhoon status.[11] At 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Noul to a severe tropical storm, and later to typhoon status at 06:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a06.[5] The storm's spiral rainbands became increasingly organized,[12] although the eye initially remained cloud-filled.[13] Early on May\u00a07, Noul crossed 135\u00ba\u00a0E into the area of responsibility of PAGASA \u2013 the Philippines' weather bureau \u2013 who assigned the local name Dodong.[14] Due to radial outflow, low vertical wind shear, and water temperatures above 30\u00b0C, Noul started rapid deepening on May\u00a09 while approaching the Philippine island of Luzon, forming a sharply well-defined 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) eye embedded in a deepening symmetric core; therefore, the JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon late on the same day.[15] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a010, the JMA estimated peak 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph).[5] At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[16] As the typhoon neared the northeast tip of Luzon, satellite imagery showed rapid deterioration of the storm's core structure and warming of the cloud tops. According to PAGASA, at around 08:45\u00a0UTC on May\u00a010, Noul made landfall in the Philippines at Pananapan Point in Santa Ana, Cagayan.[17] However, the JMA and JTWC tracks do not show landfall, but instead show the center staying offshore. After its closest approach to Luzon, the storm's structure continued to deteriorate, becoming elongated and less organized due to increasing wind shear and land interaction.[18] By late on May\u00a010, the eye largely disappeared from satellite imagery as Noul turned northward over water, steered around the subtropical ridge.[19] A large residual eye persisted in the center of the waning convection,[20] although stronger wind shear increasingly disrupted the storm's structure. An approaching trough steered Noul to the northeast, bringing it east of Taiwan on May\u00a011.[21] By early on May\u00a012, the storm had become increasingly elongated as dry air became entrained in the center, with the structure resembling a \"comma\"-shape, according to the JTWC. The agency downgraded it to a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC that day as the storm accelerated through Amami \u014cshima.[22] Six hours later, the storm became extratropical off the southern coast of Japan.[5][23] The extratropical remnants of Noul continued to the northeast. Around 12:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a012, the storm passed through the Kant\u014d region of southeastern Japan. The center quickly moved back over water and passed just east of Hokkaido on May\u00a013. Noul slowed its forward motion while remaining south of the Kuril Islands and Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a016, the remnants of Noul dissipated near the International Date Line,[5] after being absorbed by another large extratropical storm.[24][25]"

Damage on the island was estimated at US$100,000.[28] The storm delayed a supply ship to outlying islands of the state that were previously affected by Typhoon Maysak a month prior.[27]"

In response to the storm, PAGASA raised warning signal 4, the highest level, for northeastern Cagayan as well as the offshore Batanes and Babuyan Islands. Neighboring provinces had lower warning signals. A total of 3,803\u00a0people evacuated their homes in Cagayan and Isabela to 27\u00a0storm shelters; families returned home by late on May\u00a010 after the storm moved ashore without causing much damage. Flights and ferry routes were canceled, stranding 10,000\u00a0people. The Philippine Army deployed 18\u00a0soldiers to assist in storm preparations, utilizing boats and helicopters.[29] Fisherfolk were advised not to go out to sea east of Luzon.[30] People were also evacuated from the vicinity of Mount Bulusan after rains from Noul threatened to cause lahars and mudslides from ash of a recent eruption.[31] They were allowed to return after Noul recurved to the north and the threat did not materialize.[32] Two people in Cagayan died due to electrocution while attempting to fix their roofs ahead of the storm.[33][34] Upon striking the Philippines, the typhoon produced high winds and heavy rainfall to Luzon.[33] Noul knocked down trees and damaged houses,[35] resulting in power outages to seven communities; the power was restored within one day.[29] The storm's rains were beneficial to local farmers after an extended dry spell.[34] In Santa Ana where the storm moved ashore, the storm caused minor damage to seven schools. Across Cagayan, the storm damaged \u20b12.7\u00a0million (US$61,000) worth of corn and rice crops, as well as minor damage to fisheries. There was minor infrastructure damage in neighboring Ilocos Norte. Overall, Noul caused \u20b116.3\u00a0million (US$366,000) in damage.[29]"

Also in the outlying islands, schools and offices were closed in anticipation of the storm, while boats sought shelter at harbors.[36] Heavy rains from the storm's outer bands and a frontal system brought much needed rain to areas of northern Taiwan suffering from a severe drought. A total of 93\u00a0mm (3.7\u00a0in) of rain fell at the Shihmen Dam,[37] amounting to an increase of approximately 7\u00a0million tonnes of water in the reservoir,[38] and bringing it to 30.5% capacity.[37] Several major cities were able to lift water rationing as a result.[38] Rainfall amounted to 69\u00a0mm (2.7\u00a0in) at the Baoshan Reservoir, 60.5\u00a0mm (2.38\u00a0in) at the Mingte Reservoir, and 52.5\u00a0mm (2.07\u00a0in) at the Feistui Reservoir.[37] On May\u00a011, Noul impacted the Ryukyu Islands of Japan as a weakening typhoon. The Yaeyama Islands experienced unexpectedly strong winds, with Ishigaki measuring its highest sustained winds during May on record at 104\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph); records there began in 1897. To the east, sustained winds of 131\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) and gusts to 172\u00a0km/h (107\u00a0mph) were observed on Shimoji-shima.[39] Across Okinawa, the storm's high winds and waves damaged crops,[40] accounting for \u00a52.8\u00a0billion (US$23.3\u00a0million) in crop damage. Most of the crop damage occurred in the Miyako District,[41] where the storm also caused power outages.[42] On Tokunoshima island, the storm damaged 13\u00a0houses and injured six people.[43] The typhoon also caused 47\u00a0flights to be canceled, stranding 4,300\u00a0people. Noul dropped heavy rainfall across Japan that set daily May records, including 143\u00a0mm (5.6\u00a0in) on Ishigaki Island. Rainfall also spread into the main islands of Japan, reaching 180\u00a0mm (7.1\u00a0in) in the T\u014dkai region.[44] One person in Kyoto sustained significant injuries after falling amid high winds.[45] The storm also delayed oil shipments from Japan's oil refineries.[46] The remnants of Noul, in conjunction with later Typhoon Dolphin, shifted the broader weather pattern to bring record warmth to Alaska, making the temperatures warmer than that of Washington, D.C.[47]"

The Prime Minister of Spain Mariano Rajoy and Jorge Gomes, Portugal's secretary of state of internal administration, believed most of the fires were lit by arsonists.[7] By 15 October 2017 winds increased, due in part to Hurricane Ophelia passing between the Azores and the peninsula, which helped fan wildfires in both Portugal and Spain. In Portugal, on its worst day, firefighters battled over 440 fires.[8] The country sought assistance from European neighbours and Morocco.  The Portuguese Minister of Internal Administration Constan\u00e7a Urbano de Sousa, who resigned as a consequence, said \"We have all our firefighters out there doing everything they can\".[citation needed] Four months earlier, the June 2017 Portugal wildfires had caused 66 deaths in Portugal, for a total of 115 deaths (111 in Portugal, 4 in Spain) between the two incidents."

By Saturday, July 8, the fire was a reported 2,000 acres in size with an estimated 10 homes destroyed and a mere 2% containment. A reported five people had already been injured as a result of the fire, four of which were civilians.[5] Over the course of the day, the fire reportedly doubled in size to over 4,400 acres as nearly 1,000 fire personnel were on scene fighting the fire.[6] More structures were seen burning in the area although there were unknown estimate as to how many were homes.[6] On Sunday morning, July 9, evacuation orders were extended to include Oro Bangor Highway from Swedes Flat Road to Avocado Road, including all connection roads and areas, leaving 750 structures threatened by the fire. However, containment was up by 17 percent.[6] By mid afternoon, that day, the fire was 5,000 acres in size with 17 percent of the fire contained.[6] The fire had grown to 5,800 acres on the evening of July 10 as over 5,400 structures were still threatened, however over 1,700 firecrews had contained 40 percent of the incident.[7] At the height of the fire, evacuation orders were put into effect for more than 4,000 residents and an additional 7,400 people were put under an evacuation advisory, according to officials. Gov. Jerry Brown issued a state of emergency for the Butte County area on Sunday, July 9.[8] The Wall Fire was 100% contained by 9:45 am, July 17. In total, it burned 6,033 acres (2,441\u00a0ha).

        "content": "On June\u00a02, the Storm Prediction Center outlined a Moderate risk of severe weather across a large portion of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States regions, allowing a series of shortwave troughs to undercut the vortex across the northern half of the country. Strong southerly flow ahead of a fast-moving cold front contributed to robust moisture return, with dewpoints in excess of 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C) into central New York, in excess of 60\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C) across the Washington metropolitan area, and in excess of 70\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) into the Ohio River Valley. Combined with a very unstable atmosphere, exhibited by convective available potential energy values forecast above 3,000\u00a0J/kg, forecasters remarked on the potentially for a classic northwest flow event.[2] Into the afternoon hours, a main shortwave accompanied by 500\u00a0mb winds up to 80 knots (90\u00a0mph; 150\u00a0km/h) pushed toward Lake Michigan.[3] This feature enhanced a low-level convergence zone and surface barometric pressure falls associated with a lee trough east of the Appalachian Mountains, and generally contributed to widespread favorable wind profiles conducive for supercells. Given forecast storm relative helicity values of 300\u2013600\u00a0m2/s2, the possibility of isolated significant, F2 or stronger on the Fujita scale, tornadoes were possible.[4] Storms first developed across portions of Ontario southward into Ohio,[5] and scattered supercells evolved across southern New York, Pennsylvania, the Delmarva region, and North Carolina over subsequent hours as the cold front continued eastward. This activity ultimately weakened as it encountered a loss of daytime heating and moisture closer to the coastline with the Atlantic Ocean.[6]"

        "content": "The most significant tornado of the outbreak was a violent F4 tornado that tracked across Pennsylvania and Maryland during the evening hours of June\u00a02. The parent supercell responsible for the tornado persisted for over 200 miles (320\u00a0km).[38] The tornado first touched down at 9:00\u00a0p.m. EDT (01:00\u00a0UTC) in extreme eastern Fayette County, Pennsylvania, where it only sheared or uprooted trees.[36] The tornado crossed into Somerset County, where it rapidly grew to a maximum width of 1,760 yards (1,610\u00a0m) and intensified to F3 strength. Though the tornado moved across generally rural areas, it still encountered many farms which were completely demolished. A manufactured home was blown off its foundation. In conjunction with other tornadoes in the county that afternoon, about 30 to 40 properties sustained some form of damage. Over 100 heads of cattle were killed in one destroyed barn alone, and many other farms suffered the loss of dozens of livestock too.[23] The tornado crossed into Garrett County, Maryland, now at F2 strength. It destroyed several buildings as it moved through the town of Finzel, including a small house and a cinder-block garage.[37] As the tornado crossed into Allegany County, it acquired multiple-vortex characteristics and reached violent F4 intensity with winds up to 210 miles per hour (340\u00a0km/h), the highest on record in Maryland. It descended Big Savage Mountain and entered Frostburg. In this area, at least eight homes were destroyed, including a two-story house that was obliterated. Dozens of other houses were damaged. An equal number of cars were damaged, some of which were totaled.[38] Structures in this area were particularly susceptible to the tornado, as Frostburg resides on the Allegheny Plateau at an elevation around 2,000\u00a0ft (610\u00a0m) and thus faced full exposure to tornadic winds.[52] Additional damage was incurred to structures in Eckhart Mines and Clarysville before the tornado crossed Dans Mountain. It continued north of Cresaptown before lifting. In total, the tornado was on the ground for 36.8 miles (59.2\u00a0km) and 50\u00a0minutes.[38][36][23][37] Approximately 29 houses were destroyed and another 125 were damaged along the tornado's path, and about half of the homes remaining nevertheless suffered moderate to major damage. Thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted. Debris from the Frostburg area was carried upwards of 100 miles (160\u00a0km) downstream toward Sterling, Virginia.[52] Initial monetary cost from the tornado ranged from $4.5\u20135\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD). Five people were injured.[38] It is one of three violent F4 tornadoes on record in Maryland, with the other two occurring in 1926 and 2002.[53]"

It displaced a manufactured home off its foundation by about 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) and inflicted significant damage to its front side. An adjacent farm vehicle, pickup truck, and storage shed stopped the structure from rolling down a nearby steep hill. A storage building was severely damaged near this location, with its roof completely ripped off and some of its metal beams removed from the siding. The tornadic funnel ascended to the tree top level for a time but descended once more as it flattened a large barn. Roofing material from the barn was thrown up to 300 yards (270\u00a0m) downstream. A newly built home with a large rear deck suffered only minor damage in this vicinity.[45] The tornado continued into Wyoming County and affected structures along a small hill, causing minor damage to their siding and roofs. As it crossed Lake Carey and impacted surrounding structures, it reached F3 intensity. Every structure along a narrow strip of land across Lake Carey was either severely damaged or completely flattened. At one house, an elderly woman and her grandson were sucked out of their second story home, resulting in their deaths. The tornado continued up another hill east of the lake and continued to inflict significant damage to homes. One of the houses was reduced to its bare foundation and a portion of its back wall In total, 42 homes around this area were significantly damaged or demolished. Over a dozen small and anchored boats were tossed out of the water and onto the shoreline. The tornado continued into East Lemon Township, heavily damaged three houses. One of the houses had its roof ripped off and its garage destroyed, while a second had its back deck destroyed and all of its back windows blown out. One injury occurred in the township.[46] The tornado moved into Lackawanna County, where it struck the campus of Keystone Junior College, blowing out windows and twisting gutters. After 35 miles (56\u00a0km), the tornado finally lifted in North Abington Township.[47]"

It traveled a total of 12 to 15\u00a0km (7.5 to 9.3\u00a0mi).[3] It passed over bodies of water and became a waterspout, sending volumes of water into the air. Fishes at a nearby pond were picked up and deposited across the area. The water level in the pond reportedly fell by a foot. Moving through a marsh, the tornado also deposited large amounts of clay across the field. Many houses were destroyed and trees uprooted during the event, while residents heard a \"strange noise\" for many minutes. Intense lightning activity was interpreted from reports of a red fiery glow in the sky.[3] There were no meteorological stations in the vicinity of the tornado, hence many scientific parameters cannot be determined.[3] According to government officials however, the travel speed of the tornado is thought to be up to 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph).[4] According to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, the tornado was assigned an F2 rating on the Fujita scale with wind speeds of 198\u00a0km/h (123\u00a0mph) (written as 55\u00a0m/s (180\u00a0ft/s)).[1][5] Field surveys indicate the average radius of the tornado ranged from 60 to 80\u00a0m (200 to 260\u00a0ft). At its maximum, the tornado was 100 to 150\u00a0m (330 to 490\u00a0ft) wide. A 17\u00a0km2 (6.6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) area was affected by strong tornadic winds, with a 1\u00a0km2 (0.39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) area suffering extreme damage.

Some 1,731 families across eight unions in Brahmanbaria were affected.[7] Numerous homes, most of which were small and of frail construction, were completely destroyed, though a few well-built structures sustained major damage as well. Debris was scattered in all directions, and homes that were hit ranged from lightweight metal shacks, to small masonry homes. Several people were killed after being picked up and thrown by the tornado, and two of the fatalities were a woman and her baby, tossed 250 yards from their home. The woman was pronounced dead while her child was transported to the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, where she died later that evening.[8] The body of another woman was found near a latrine, and three relatives of one survivor were among the fatalities.[8] The partial collapse of a district jailhouse resulted in the death of a guard, but all the other occupants survived.[9][10] Several thousand trees were uprooted or snapped by the tornado, while utility poles and lines suffered major damage. Some 300 livestock and 900 poultry were killed by the tornado as well.[6] Farm fields were scoured by the tornado, and over 1,200 acres of agricultural land used to grow rice and vegetables were either destroyed or damaged.

Kidd Kidd went on to sign a recording contract with Wayne's record label imprint, Young Money Entertainment. He joined the label as a member of Southern hip hop group Sqad Up, alongside fellow New Orleans\u2013based rappers, Gudda Gudda and T-Streets.[3] The group would ultimately disband and leave Young Money in 2004, due to disputes between members. Kidd Kidd would later rejoin the label and make an appearance on Lil Wayne's 2008 hit single \"Mrs. Officer\", however after not appearing in the video, Kidd Kidd severed ties with Wayne once again.[4] In June 2011, two weeks after meeting New York City\u2013based rapper 50 Cent, Kidd Kidd was shot six times.[4] In July 2011, it was announced Kidd Kidd secured a recording contract with 50 Cent's G-Unit Records.[5] 50 Cent empathized with Kidd Kidd's situation, reminiscent to his own shooting in 2000, and instead of walking away much like Columbia Records did to him, 50 Cent chose to help Kidd Kidd.[6] He has gone on to appear on numerous 50 Cent's projects, such as The Big 10 (2011), The Lost Tape (2012) and 5 (Murder by Numbers) (2012). After being prominently featured on 50 Cent's fifth album Animal Ambition, which was released in June 2014, Kidd Kidd was added to the East Coast hip hop group named G-Unit. On April 11, 2018, Kidd Kidd announced that he had left G-Unit Records to focus on his own label RLLNR Entertainment[7]"

Forming out of an area of disturbed weather on January 7, 1988, Roy quickly intensified as it moved through the Marshall Islands. By January 9, the storm intensified into a typhoon and attained its peak intensity the following day. At its peak, sustained winds reached 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph).[nb 1] Slight weakening took place before the storm moved through the Mariana Islands. Continuing westward, the system eventually struck the Philippines as a minimal typhoon before dissipating over the South China Sea on January 19. Throughout its track, Typhoon Roy was responsible for two fatalities and $28.5\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD) in losses, mainly in the Mariana Islands. Light to moderate structural damage took place across the Marshall Islands as the system moved through the region as a tropical storm. On January 12, the typhoon caused widespread damage to Guam and Rota as it brushed the two islands, destroying at least 200 homes."

        "content": "Typhoon Roy originated from an area of disturbed weather in early January 1988 in the central Pacific. Above average sea surface temperatures in the area allowed for gradual development as convection increased. By January 6, the JTWC began monitoring the disturbance for the possibility of it developing into a tropical cyclone; a mirror system was present in the Southern Hemisphere at the same time. The system south of the equator eventually developed into Tropical Cyclone Anne.[2] By January 7, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression;[3] shortly thereafter, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the depression. Early on January 8, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 01W, at which time the system was located near the Marshall Islands.[2] Tracking nearly due west, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Roy six hours after the first advisory based on satellite data.[2] By this time, the JMA had already classified Roy as a tropical storm.[3] Continued deepening took place as the storm moved through the Marshall Islands; weather radar data from Kwajalein Atoll indicated the formation of an eye several hours after Roy was named; this was later supported by satellite information on January 9, at which time the storm was upgraded to a typhoon. Embedded within a moderate east-southeasterly flow along the south side of a subtropical ridge, the typhoon accelerated, obtaining a forward speed of 40\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph).[2] During the afternoon of January 10, Roy reached its peak intensity as a low-range Category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale, attaining peak winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph).[2] At the same time, the JMA estimated that the storm attained peak winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) along with a barometric pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76\u00a0inHg).[3] Upon reaching this strength, the storm was situated roughly 945\u00a0km (587\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Guam. Over the following few days, Roy gradually slowed and weakened as it neared the Mariana Islands. The storm made its closest approach to the islands early on January 12, passing within 14\u00a0km (8.7\u00a0mi) south of Rota. As the storm passed through the region, a new ridge built east of the typhoon, causing Roy to temporarily track southwestward before resuming a westward movement.[2] Moving along the southern edge of the ridge, Roy accelerated again as it headed towards the Philippines.[2] On January 14, the storm crossed 135\u00b0E, prompting the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration to issue advisories on Roy, assigning it with the local name Asiang.[1] As it neared the country, wind shear began to increase, resulting in further weakening. On January 16, Roy made landfall in the Bicol Region as a minimal typhoon before weakening to shear and increased friction with the mountains of the Philippines. Later that day, the system weakened to a tropical storm before entering the South China Sea. The JTWC downgraded Roy to a tropical depression during the afternoon of January 17 and ceased issuing advisories early the next day.[2] However, the JMA continued to monitor Roy as a tropical storm until the morning of January 18 and declared the system dissipated early on January 19, at which time the depression was situated roughly 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[3]"

Sustained winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) and gusts up to 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) affected the area, resulting in minor structural damage. Later that day, the intensifying storm passed close to Kwajalein Atoll, bringing strong winds and large swells. Moderate structural damage took place on Kwajalein Island where winds gusted up to 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph). Just to the north, more severe damage was recorded on Ebeye Island where low-lying areas were inundated by waves between 6.1 and 6.7\u00a0m (20 and 22\u00a0ft).[2] Approximately one third of the homes on Ebeye were destroyed by the storm.[4] One person was killed and damage was estimated at $5\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD).[2] An estimated 3,500 people were left homeless as a result of Roy in the Marshall Islands.[5] Ahead of Roy's arrival in the Mariana Islands and Guam, the public was given sufficient warning by the local disaster preparedness team.[2] An estimated 1,200 people evacuated to shelters across Guam and all flights to and from the island were canceled for January 12.[6] On January 12, Typhoon Roy passed through the Mariana Islands and Guam, causing moderate structural damage and extensive crop losses. On Guam alone, agricultural losses reached $23.5\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD; $60.5\u00a0million 2024 USD). Most structural damage was limited to broken windows on the island. Located within 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) of Roy's eye during its passage of the Mariana Islands, Rota received the worst damage from the cyclone. Winds on the island gusted up to 193\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), wreaking havoc to structures and vegetation.[2] At least 200 of the 450 of homes on Rota were destroyed and the remainder were damaged;[7] 95% of the power poles fell across the island, resulting in severe disruption to daily life.[2] Roughly 80% of the concrete homes had their windows blown out.[8] Four people were injured after the roof of one building was blown into another where people had sought shelter.[2] One person died after suffering a heart attack induced by the storm.[9] In the wake of the storm, the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared a state of emergency for Guam.[7][10] The last area affected by Typhoon Roy was the Philippines, which was struck by the storm on January 16.[2] Prior to the storm's arrival, typhoon warnings were raised for 29 provinces in the country, including the capital city of Manila.[11] In the Bicol Region, winds likely reached typhoon intensity; however, no known damage took place in the area. Continuing westward, the Roy brought gale-force winds to parts of southern Luzon before moving into the South China Sea.[2][12] Low-lying areas in the storm's path were flooded by heavy rains and strong winds downed power lines in Sorsogon.[13]"

It also attained the second-highest sustained winds during January, estimated at 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph).[14] According to the JTWC, Roy was the third-most intense typhoon during the month, attaining peak winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) and an estimated pressure of 927 mbar (hPa; 27.37\u00a0inHg).[15] In addition to intensity records, Typhoon Roy also was an unusually long-lived storm, spanning 12 days from formation to dissipation. This ranks it as the second-longest lived storm during January, just 12\u00a0hours short of Typhoon Alice in 1979.[16] Due to the severity of damage wrought by Typhoon Roy, the name was retired following its usage and replaced with Ryan.[17] Since little damage took place in the Philippines, the name Asiang was not retired and was later used for another cyclone.[1]"

        "content": "Chile has been suffering from a megadrought since 2010 \u2013 the worst for a thousand years.[3][4] These drought conditions exacerbate summer fires because the vegetation becomes more flammable.[5] Since 30 January 2023, the \u00d1uble region has maintained a preventive early warning due to the threat of forest fires as a result of high temperatures.[6] The fires coincided with an unprecedented heat wave in the south of the country, with temperatures reaching 40 degrees Celsius in southern areas.[7][8] Ren\u00e9 Garreaud from the University of Chile said the extremely high temperatures are driven by warm, naturally-recurring Puelche winds blowing from the east, superimposed on a warmer climate.[9] The interior minister, Manuel Monsalve, confirmed that 17 people had been arrested for possibly starting fires by such activities as welding or burning wool.[10] While the wildfires may have been directly caused by human elements, the underlying drought conditions which have contributed to the severity of the wildfires have been attributed to a mix of worsening climate change conditions and the Pacific weather pattern known as La Ni\u00f1a.[11] Though South America has a long history of drought, Chile is among the most vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events, changes in seasonal temperatures and rainfall, wildfires, and sea-level rise (flooding).[12] Poor territorial planning has been blamed for the ease of spread of the wildfires.[13] In late August 2022, Christi\u00e1n Little, director of National Forest Corporation (CONAF), explained in the Chilean Congress that there was a major risk of wildfires, large and simultaneous, from October 2022 to January 2023.[14] It was argued that while 2022 had been a year with significant rains[A] this had contributed to growth of grass that could produce fires in the dry season. The agriculture committee of the congress was updated by CONAF with a new harsher forecast in January 2023.[14] According to an estimate of CONAF about 41% of the wildfires in \u00d1uble, Biob\u00edo and Araucan\u00eda regions, from July 2022 to late February 2023, have been man-made and intentional.[16][17][18] On a national level during the same period 25% of wildfires are thought by CONAF to be intentional.[16][19] The eventual spread of fires by wildlife such as rabbits-on-fire has been mentioned by officials but knowledge about this is mainly based on anecdotes and forest experts doubt the efficiency and relevance of this method of spread as rabbits-on-fire are likely move only a few meters before perishing or going out.[20][21][13] As of 18\u00a0February, 256 fires were burning across the country while a further 151 were under control. After a period of reprieve, fires began reigniting on 18\u00a0February in south-central Chile.[1] By 20\u00a0February, the National Disaster Prevention and Response Service (Senapred) announced that 173 foci had been extinguished, but that 70 were still active.[22] Various specialists have pointed out the \"human\" and political causes of the fires that recurrently strike Chile. In 1974, the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet signed a decree designed to subsidise the intensive forestry industry and the monoculture of eucalyptus - a highly inflammable species - in the centre and south of the country.[citation needed] The NGO Bosque Nativo deplores \"the great deficiencies in the management of these monocultures. The majority of plantations are in the hands of two large industrial companies\" and points to \"a lack of control over these forestry companies. This would allow the state to guarantee sustainable management of these plantations, taking into account economic, social and environmental aspects. The regulation of the real estate sector, accused of taking advantage of the fires to develop, is also demanded by several NGOs. President Gabriel Boric has asked parliamentarians to urgently examine a draft law aimed at banning construction on burnt land for at least 30 years.[23] In 2017, central and southern Chile had already been hit by very large fires, with eleven deaths and 467,000 hectares burnt. Following these fires, the Centre for Climate and Resilience Sciences (CR2) published a report in 2020 recommending regulation of the forestry industry: \"In a climate change scenario that favours an increase in the frequency, extent and intensity of fires, [...] it is very important to generate policies aimed at the control of invasive alien species [mainly pines and eucalyptus] and the restoration of native ecosystems to reduce the probability of catastrophic events.\"[23]"

        "content": " Typhoon Mujigae, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Kabayan, was the costliest typhoon to impact China in 2015. The typhoon first passed over the Philippines as a developing tropical cyclone from October\u00a01 to 3, 2015. It then caused widespread damage in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan from October\u00a03 to 6. Afterwards, as Mujigae weakened inland, it brought heavy rain to parts of Mainland Southeast Asia. Mujigae originated from an area of disturbed weather that formed just east of the Philippines on September\u00a030. The disturbance slowly organized amid a favorable environment, becoming a tropical depression later that day. It traveled steadily west-northwestwards and made landfall in Central Luzon late on October\u00a01, before crossing into the South China Sea the next morning. Mujigae strengthened rapidly on October\u00a03, becoming a mature typhoon with 10-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph), and a minimum pressure of 950\u00a0hPa (28.05\u00a0inHg). The typhoon then made landfall over Zhanjiang, Guangdong, and weakened swiftly, dissipating inland over Guangxi on October\u00a05. As a developing system, Mujigae brought gusty winds, moderate rain, and rough seas to the island of Luzon in the Philippines. The adverse weather forced ports and schools to close, while numerous landslides and flash floods damaged roads, houses, and agricultural land. Large waves caused by the storm capsized several fishing boats, necessitating search-and-rescue operations by the Philippine Navy and Coast Guard. In total, Mujigae killed at least four in the Philippines, left 12\u00a0missing, and caused damage valued at \u20b146.9\u00a0million (US$1.03\u00a0million).[nb 2] Mujigae's most severe impacts occurred in China, with the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan being the worst hit. The typhoon affected 7.5\u00a0million people across the three provinces, causing 27 fatalities and economic losses of \u00a527\u00a0billion (US$4.3\u00a0billion). The outer bands of the typhoon spawned destructive tornadoes in Guangzhou and Foshan that killed seven and left 223\u00a0injured. Infrastructural damage left by the tornadoes resulted in widespread disruptions to telecommunications, electricity, and water supplies. Elsewhere, fallen trees, landslides, and collapsing buildings accounted for most of the fatalities. In preparation for the storm, ships and offshore workers were recalled to port, flights were delayed or canceled, train services were suspended, and tourist attractions were shut. These disrupted tourism amid China's \"Golden Week\" holidays following their National Day. Hong Kong and Macau experienced gusty winds and heavy rain from October\u00a03 to 5 as Mujigae passed to the south, but were left relatively unscathed. Immediate post-storm relief was provided by the National Disaster Reduction Center of China and the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The National Development and Reform Commission later issued more funds for reconstruction efforts in Guangdong and Guangxi. Towards the end of Mujigae's lifespan, its outer rainbands brought heavy rains to parts of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, causing localized flash floods. Consequently, some homes and crops were damaged."

        "content": "At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030, a tropical disturbance developed near 11\u00b054\u2032N 130\u00b018\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff11.9\u00b0N 130.3\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.9; 130.3, about 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) east of the Philippines. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) deemed the disturbance to have become a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC and gave it the identifier 22W. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also classified the system as a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[2][nb 4] The depression was lopsided at this time, with the bulk of thunderstorm activity to the west of the system's center.[4] Amid low vertical wind shear and good outflow helping the growth of thunderstorms, the depression improved further in organization through October\u00a01, as it moved west-northwestwards under the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north.[5] The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration named the system Kabayan at 02:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01.[6] The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC as it began producing 10-minute sustained winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph),[nb 5] giving it the name Mujigae.[nb 6] The JTWC, however, continued to classify the system as a tropical depression as it approached the Philippines.[2] No further intensification occurred on October\u00a01 as Mujigae's circulation interacted with the Sierra Madre mountain range.[9] Mujigae made landfall between Baler and San Luis in Aurora Province, Central Luzon, at roughly 20:00\u00a0UTC,[10] and quickly crossed the island of Luzon, entering the South China Sea by 02:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02.[11] Once over water, Mujigae soon resumed intensifying, taking advantage of 28\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures and strong outflow despite slightly elevated wind shear.[12] The JTWC finally assessed Mujigae to be a tropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02; the JMA upgraded Mujigae further to severe tropical storm status six hours later.[2] A nascent eye feature became visible on microwave satellite imagery, while associated thunderstorms grew more intense and wrapped more tightly into the system's circulation.[13] Meanwhile, Mujigae continued tracking steadily west-northwest and exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility late on October\u00a02.[14] A 30-hour period of rapid intensification began at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a03, aided greatly by the anomalously warm waters of the South China Sea, which even exceeded 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) around Hainan. Monthly mean sea surface temperatures in the area were the warmest since 1990, giving Mujigae ample energy to draw upon for strengthening in spite of moderate easterly wind shear.[15] During this strengthening phase, the China Meteorological Administration's Shanghai Typhoon Institute launched four rocket-carried dropsondes into Mujigae from Wanning, Hainan, in a successful attempt to analyse the typhoon's interior structure.[16] The JMA estimated that Mujigae's winds increased from 100 to 155\u00a0km/h (62 to 96\u00a0mph) and the central pressure dropped from 985\u00a0hPa (29.09\u00a0inHg) to 950\u00a0hPa (28.05\u00a0inHg) from 00:00\u00a0UTC October\u00a03 to 00:00\u00a0UTC October\u00a04, after which it peaked in intensity. The JTWC assessed that Mujigae continued to strengthen for a further three hours and attained peak 1-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph),[2] the equivalent of a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[17] At its peak, Mujigae possessed a sharply-defined eye just 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) wide, centered in a symmetric central dense overcast.[18] Shortly after, Mujigae made landfall in Potou District, Zhanjiang, Guangdong province, at 06:10\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04.[19] Rapid weakening commenced as the center of circulation moved over land, staying north of the Gulf of Tonkin.[20] Mujigae weakened to a tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04 and the JMA ceased monitoring the system as a tropical depression at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05. The JTWC continued tracking Mujigae while it moved inland over Guangxi province and last noted it as a dissipating tropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05.[2]"

        "content": "Mujigae (known locally as Tropical Storm Kabayan) passed over Luzon from October\u00a01 to 3, bringing moderate rain and winds gusting up to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Public Storm Warning Signal No.\u00a01 was raised in the provinces of Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Aurora, and Northern Quezon on October\u00a01, and further extended to Benguet, Tarlac, Ilocos Sur, and Zambales on October\u00a02. Public Storm Warning Signal No.\u00a02\u2014the highest warning level issued for Mujigae\u2014was raised in La Union and Pangasinan on October\u00a02. All warnings were lifted by the evening of October\u00a02 as Mujigae began to move away from the Philippines.[21] The tropical storm affected roughly 59,600\u00a0people during its passage over the Philippines. A peak 24-hour rainfall total of 134.0\u00a0mm (5.28\u00a0in) occurred in Iba, Zambales. In Central Luzon, a total of 703\u00a0houses were damaged, of which 97 were destroyed. A landslide in Gabaldon, Nueva Ecija required the evacuation of 30\u00a0families, while another landslide in Buenavista, Marinduque damaged a wall.[21] Several incidents of flash flooding were reported, with 50\u00a0barangays (village-level administrative districts) inundated with up to 0.9\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft) of water.[22] A person in Maria Aurora municipality drowned in a flash flood, while another from Bongabon municipality was killed by a snake bite.[23][24] The body of a fisherman was found in Agno municipality on October\u00a03, two days after he went fishing out at sea and was reported missing.[21] In total, roughly 6,480\u00a0people evacuated to seven shelters. Classes were suspended across much of Luzon on October\u00a02.[25] Ports were closed in the Bicol Region and Southern Tagalog on October\u00a02 and 3 because of rough seas, leaving up to 212\u00a0passengers and 53\u00a0rolling cargoes stranded.[26][27][28] Twelve roads and two bridges were blocked by flooding and mudslides.[25] Power outages occurred on October\u00a02 and 3 in parts of Aurora, Benguet, and Pangasinan, including in Baguio, though services were quickly restored.[29] Damage to agriculture and infrastructure in Ilocos and Central Luzon was valued at \u20b146.9\u00a0million (US$1.03\u00a0million), mostly from the provinces of Aurora, Pampanga, and Pangasinan. Following the storm, local government units and the Department of Social Welfare and Development gave \u20b12.37\u00a0million (US$52,100) worth of disaster relief to Aurora, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija provinces.[21] Numerous incidents occurred at sea as fishermen continued operations despite being advised against doing so by government agencies and the Philippine Coast Guard.[30][31] Several fishing boats were capsized by large waves, leaving fishermen adrift in the water for up to four days before they were picked up by other boats or were swept back to shore.[32] As many as 121\u00a0fishermen were missing on the night of October\u00a03.[23] The Philippine Navy activated two Islander aircraft and several ships to conduct search and rescue operations,[21] in conjunction with vessels from the Coast Guard.[30] They were largely successful in locating the missing fishermen, with the number of missing decreasing to 56 by October\u00a05.[31] A \"partial and unofficial report\" from the Coast Guard on October\u00a06 stated that three fishermen had been confirmed dead;[33] a body of another fisherman was recovered from the waters off Pangasinan on October\u00a07.[34] The searches were called off between October\u00a07 and 10, leaving 12 still missing.[21]"

With economic losses estimated at \u00a527\u00a0billion (US$4.3\u00a0billion), Mujigae was the costliest typhoon to impact China in 2015. At landfall in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, the China Meteorological Administration estimated Mujigae to have winds of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg), making Mujigae the strongest typhoon to make landfall in China in the month of October since 1949. The three provinces experienced strong winds of at least 76\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph), with a peak gust of 242\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) recorded in Zhanjiang. Torrential rain fell over the region throughout the four days, leading to rainfall accumulations of 100\u2013500\u00a0mm (3.9\u201319.7\u00a0in). The outer rainbands of Mujigae also produced tornadoes in parts of Guangdong on October\u00a04.[35][36] Power outages occurred in much of the region and transport lines were cut. Mujigae came ashore during a week-long holiday (known as a \"Golden Week\") following China's National Day, disrupting the plans of many tourists seeking to travel to the southern coast.[37][38] Mujigae's track and rapid intensification prior to landfall drew comparisons to Typhoon Rammasun, which had significantly impacted similar areas a year earlier.[39]"

        "content": "Ahead of the storm, the China Meteorological Administration issued red alerts for the province, expecting wind gusts exceeding 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and rainfall accumulations of 250\u2013280\u00a0mm (9.8\u201311.0\u00a0in).[40] The Qiongzhou Strait was closed to marine traffic on the evening of October\u00a02, and nearly 40,000\u00a0fishing boats west of Shanwei returned to port to shelter in Guangdong.[41] Coastal tourist attractions in the province were closed from October\u00a03.[42] The suspension of ferry services to offshore islands left 503\u00a0tourists on Fangji Island stranded; strong winds hampered attempts to return them to the mainland.[43][44] The National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center issued warnings for storm surge and large waves that same day.[45] Flights out of Zhuhai and Zhanjiang were canceled.[43] China Southern Power Grid readied 24,000\u00a0workers to address any power disruptions.[38] Authorities evacuated 170,400 people in vulnerable areas.[46] Mujigae made landfall in Potou District, Zhanjiang, on the afternoon of October\u00a04. The typhoon brought high winds and heavy rain to over 3.53\u00a0million people in Guangdong,[46] and spawned at least three tornadoes in the province.[47] One tornado touched down in Guangzhou's Panyu District, killing three and injuring 134.[48] The tornado damaged several houses and factories, blew down trees, and damaged power cables. Large parts of Panyu and Haizhu Districts thus lost power for the first time in 23\u00a0years. Tourists visiting the Canton Tower in Haizhu had to be evacuated after it suffered a blackout. The power outages had a further knock-on effect on communications and water infrastructure, resulting in greater disruption.[47] Another tornado touched down in Shunde District, Foshan, causing four deaths and 89\u00a0injuries,[48][46] while inflicting roughly \u00a5180\u00a0million (US$29\u00a0million) of damage. The tornado touched down for 32\u00a0minutes and traveled 30.85\u00a0km (19.17\u00a0mi) northwest, leaving a damage swath of diameter between 20 and 570\u00a0m (22 and 623\u00a0yd).[49] It was also noted to have possessed twin funnels at peak intensity.[50] The Foshan tornado was rated EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, based on observations of collapsed tower cranes and destroyed factories and warehouses. A third tornado\u2014this time a waterspout\u2014occurred near the coast of Shanwei.[49][47] For context, tornadoes in China are rather uncommon: on average less than 100 occur in a year, and in the 50\u00a0years prior to 2015, only 20 were at or above EF3 intensity. Hence, when Mujigae struck China in 2015, the country had no tornado forecasting or warning systems, likely contributing to an elevated number of fatalities and more extensive damage.[50][51] Damage was most severe in Zhanjiang, the site of Mujigae's landfall. The city experienced widespread blackouts and disruptions to water supplies and telecommunications, which hampered damage assessments.[52] The waters of Zhanjiang Bay experienced an atypical period of elevated biodegradation of organic matter, following increased surface runoff entering the bay; this usually causes algal blooms instead.[53] The storm sank two fishing boats docked in the city's port, drowning three and leaving four missing. A collapsed building in Xiashan District killed another.[54] Elsewhere, landslides killed a total of seven people: four in Xinyi, Maoming, two in Luoding, Yunfu, and one in Guangning County, Zhaoqing.[46] Overall, in Guangdong, Mujigae killed at least 18\u00a0people and left four missing. The typhoon damaged 3,374 houses and 282,700 hectares (699,000 acres) of crops across the province. Direct economic losses reached \u00a523.24\u00a0billion (US$3.730\u00a0billion).[46]"

Meanwhile, 530\u00a0passengers were stranded at Nanning Wuxu International Airport as two flights were delayed by more than five hours and two others were scrapped. Services along the Guangxi coastal high-speed railway between Nanning and Beihai were halted from noon on October\u00a04 to midnight on October\u00a05.[55] Scenic attractions were closed beginning October\u00a04 and tourists evacuated.[56] About 135,100 people living in vulnerable areas were moved to safety.[57] The center of Mujigae crossed into Guangxi from Guangdong on the evening of October\u00a04, though heavy rains and gusty winds persisted in Guangxi through October\u00a04 and 5.[56] The typhoon affected 2.67\u00a0million people in the province.[57] The strongest winds were recorded in Bobai County, where winds gusted up to 119\u00a0km/h (74\u00a0mph), and a peak rainfall total of 418.6\u00a0mm (16.48\u00a0in) was observed at Shengtang Mountain in Jinxiu Yao Autonomous County. Numerous flash floods and landslides occurred in the mountains of southeast Guangxi, damaging roads and buildings.[56] A person was crushed and killed by a fallen tree in Nanning;[58] the typhoon killed a total of two people in the province.[59] Damage to power lines caused 1.155\u00a0million residents of Guangxi to lose power on October\u00a05.[60] The typhoon completely destroyed 954\u00a0houses, severely damaged another 1,532\u00a0houses, and left 5,478 more with mild damage. About 144,800 hectares (358,000 acres) of cropland was affected by rain and wind, of which 6,650 hectares (16,400 acres) were deemed a complete loss.[57] Direct economic losses were at least \u00a5919\u00a0million (US$148\u00a0million), of which \u00a5752\u00a0million (US$121\u00a0million) was from agriculture and \u00a546.8\u00a0million (US$7.52\u00a0million) was from property damage.[61]"

Rainfall totals from October\u00a02 to 5 ranged around 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in), reaching up to 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) over the southwestern part of Lantau Island. The weather conditions caused 39\u00a0aircraft to be diverted from Hong Kong International Airport,[77] and disrupted ferry services to and from Macau.[78] At least 30\u00a0incidents of fallen trees and 14\u00a0incidents of flooding were recorded, with a fallen tree near Fanling station halting train services by damaging overhead cables.[77] A runner participating in a race between Lantau and Sunset Peaks suffered a broken arm when he slipped off the track amid the adverse weather conditions.[79] The final round of the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship ended prematurely due to thunderstorms on the morning of October\u00a04.[80] Nearby Macau experienced a similar situation from October\u00a03 to 5.[81] Typhoon Signal No. 3 was raised from the evening of October\u00a03 to the morning on October\u00a05 as heavy rains and gusty winds buffeted the territory.[82] Some flooding occurred in low-lying regions.[77] The Fire Services Bureau received 27 reports of fallen trees; in total they responded to 59 typhoon-related incidents. Thunderstorms forced the cancellation of six outdoor events and delayed at least 15 flights from Macau International Airport.[81] Ferry operator TurboJET suspended services from Macau to Shenzhen and Hong Kong.[83] A woman at the University of Macau suffered cuts on her limbs from broken glass and was sent to hospital.[81] The adverse weather caused Macau's tourist visitation numbers to drop by 16\u00a0percent in the week following the typhoon, erasing gains from China's Golden Week holidays.[84] As Mujigae weakened inland over China, it brought torrential rain to parts of Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos.[85] The combination of Mujigae and a cold front brought up to 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) of rain to mountainous regions in the Vietnamese provinces of Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh, L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, and Cao B\u1eb1ng.[86] Meanwhile, heavy rains in Northeast and Central Thailand had the beneficial effect of filling reservoirs, but caused several flash floods on October\u00a04 and 5. One such flood in Nakhon Sawan Province ruined 2,000\u00a0rai (320 hectares; 790 acres) of cropland, while another in Chachoengsao Province inundated 40\u00a0houses, causing damage to agricultural equipment and electrical appliances. In Ratchaburi Province, a crocodile farm was flooded, and some of the crocodiles escaped. Other provinces affected by flash floods included Chanthaburi and Kamphaeng Phet.[87][88]"

Outages in Hainan and Guangxi were fully resolved on October\u00a05 and 7, respectively.[91][92][93] On October\u00a027, the Chinese government announced that \u00a5300\u00a0million (US$48\u00a0million) of funds would be set aside for disaster relief efforts in Guangdong and Guangxi in addition to drought-stricken North China. This would cover reconstruction efforts and living expenses for those affected by Mujigae in the two provinces.[94] A further contribution of \u00a5103\u00a0million (US$16.5\u00a0million) was announced by the National Development and Reform Commission on November\u00a05.[95]"

Hansel and Gretel are siblings who are abandoned in a forest and fall into the hands of a witch who lives in a bread,[3] cake, and sugar house. The witch, who has cannibalistic intentions, intends to fatten Hansel before eventually eating him. However, Gretel saves her brother by pushing the witch into her own oven, killing her, and escaping with the witch's treasure.[4] Set in medieval Germany, \"Hansel and Gretel\" has been adapted into various media, including the opera H\u221a\u00a7nsel und Gretel by Engelbert Humperdinck, which was first performed in 1893.[5][6]"

Shortly after this period, close written variants like Martin Montanus' Garten Gesellschaft (1590) began to appear.[4] Scholar Christine Goldberg argues that the episode of the paths marked with stones and crumbs, already found in the French \"Finette Cendron\" and \"Hop-o'-My-Thumb\" (1697), represents \"an elaboration of the motif of the thread that Ariadne gives Theseus to use to get out of the Minoan labyrinth\".[8] A house made of confectionery is also found in a 14th-century manuscript about the Land of Cockayne.[5]"

Even their final version in the 7th edition (1857) remains unclear about her role, for it refers to the woodcutter's wife twice as \"the mother\" and once as \"the stepmother\".[2] The sequence where the duck helps them across the river is also a later addition. In some later versions, the mother died from unknown causes, left the family, or remained with the husband at the end of the story.[13] In the 1810 pre-publication manuscript, the children were called \"Little Brother\" and \"Little Sister\", then named H\u221a\u00a7nsel and Gretel in the first edition (1812).[9] Wilhelm Grimm also adulterated the text with Alsatian dialects, \"re-appropriated\" from August St\u221a\u2202ber's Alsatian version (1842) in order to give the tale a more \"folksy\" tone.[11][b] Goldberg notes that although \"there is no doubt that the Grimms' H\u221a\u00a7nsel und Gretel was pieced together, it was, however, pieced together from traditional elements,\" and its previous narrators themselves had been \"piecing this little tale together with other traditional motifs for centuries.\"[14] For instance, the duck helping the children cross the river may be the remnant of an old traditional motif in the folktale complex that was reintroduced by the Grimms in later editions.[14]"

        "header": "Plot",
        "content": "Hansel and Gretel are the young children of a poor woodcutter. When a famine settles over the land, the woodcutter's second wife tells him to take the children into the woods and leave them there to fend for themselves. The woodcutter opposes the plan, but his wife repeats her demands until he reluctantly agrees. They are unaware that in the children's bedroom, Hansel and Gretel have overheard them. After the parents have gone to bed, Hansel sneaks out of the house and gathers as many shiny white pebbles as he can, then returns to his room, reassuring Gretel that God will not forsake them. The next day, the children's stepmother gives them small pieces of bread before she and their father take them into the woods. As the family walks deeper, Hansel leaves a trail of white pebbles. After their parents abandon them, the children stay in the woods until night falls and the moonlight reveals the white pebbles shining in the dark. The children then safely follow the trail back home, much to their stepmother's rage. Once again, provisions become scarce and the stepmother angrily orders her husband to take the children further into the woods and leave them there. Hansel attempts to gather more pebbles, but finds his stepmother has locked the door. The following morning, the children's stepmother gives them smaller pieces of bread, before she and their father take them back into the woods. As the family treks, Hansel leaves a trail of bread crumbs for him and Gretel to follow back home. However, after they are once again abandoned, the children find that the birds have eaten the crumbs and they are lost in the woods. After three days of wandering, the children follow a dove to a clearing in the woods, and discover a cottage with bread walls, a cake roof, and sugar windows. Hungry and tired, the children begin to eat the house, when the door opens and the elderly woman that lives there emerges and takes the children inside, giving them delicious food to eat and soft beds to sleep in. What the children do not know is that their kind hostess is an evil witch who had built the bread house to lure them inside so she can cook and eat them. The next morning, the witch locks Hansel in a stable and enslaves Gretel. The witch feeds Hansel regularly to fatten him up, but serves Gretel nothing but crab shells. The witch then tries to touch Hansel's finger to see how fat he has become, but he cleverly offers a thin bone he found in the cage. As the witch's eyes are too weak to notice the deception, she is fooled into thinking Hansel is still too thin for her to eat. After four weeks of this, the witch grows impatient and decides to eat Hansel anyway. She prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to the open oven and asks her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the witch's intent, pretends she does not understand what the witch means. Frustrated, the witch demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves her into the hot oven, slams and bolts the door shut, leaving the witch to burn to death. Gretel frees Hansel from the stable and the pair discover boxes full of pearls and precious stones. Putting the jewels into their pockets, the children set off for home. A white duck (or swan in some versions) ferries them across an expanse of water, and at home they find only their father; his wife had died from an unknown cause. The children's father had spent all his days missing them, and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the witch's wealth, the children and their father all live happily ever after."

In particular, Gretel's pretense of not understanding how to test the oven (\"Show Me How\") is characteristic of 327A, although it also appears traditionally in other sub-types of ATU 327.[15] As argued by Stith Thompson, the simplicity of the tale may explain its spread into several traditions all over the world.[16] A closely similar version is \"Finette Cendron\", published by Marie-Catherine d'Aulnoy in 1697, which depicts an impoverished king and queen deliberately losing their three daughters three times in the wilderness. The cleverest of the girls, Finette, initially manages to bring them home with a trail of thread, and then a trail of ashes, but her peas are eaten by pigeons during the third journey. The little girls then go to the mansion of a hag, who lives with her husband the ogre. Finette heats the oven and asks the ogre to test it with his tongue, so that he falls in and is incinerated. Thereafter, Finette cuts off the hag's head. The sisters remain in the ogre's house, and the rest of the tale relates the story of Cinderella.[5][8] In the Russian Vasilisa the Beautiful, the stepmother likewise sends her hated stepdaughter into the forest to borrow a light from her sister, who turns out to be Baba Yaga, a cannibalistic witch. Besides highlighting the endangerment of children (as well as their own cleverness), the tales have in common a preoccupation with eating and with hurting children: The mother or stepmother wants to avoid hunger, and the witch lures children to eat her house of candy so that she can then eat them.[17] In a variant from Flanders, The Sugar-Candy House, siblings Jan and Jannette get lost in the woods and sight a hut made of confectionary in the distance. When they approach, a giant wolf named Garon jumps out of the window and chases them to a river bank. Sister and brother ask a pair of ducks to help them cross the river and escape the wolf. Garon threatens the ducks to carry him over, to no avail; he then tries to cross by swimming. He sinks and surfaces three times, but disappears in the water on the fourth try. The story seems to contain the \"child/wind\" rhyming scheme of the German tale.[18] In a French fairy tale, La Cabane au Toit de Fromage (\"The Hut with the Roof made of Cheese\"), the brother is the hero who deceives the witch and locks her up in the oven.[19] In the first Puerto Rican variant of \"The Orphaned Children\", the brother pushes the witch into the oven.[20] Other folk tales of ATU 327A type include the French \"The Lost Children\", published by Antoinette Bon in 1887,[21][22] or the Moravian \"Old Gruel\", edited by Maria Kosch in 1899.[22]"

        "content": "Structural comparisons can also be made with other tales of ATU 327 type (\"The Children and the Ogre\"), which is not a simple fairy tale type but rather a \"folktale complex with interconnected subdivisions\" depicting a child (or children) falling under the power of an ogre, then escaping by their clever tricks.[23] In ATU 327B (\"The Brothers and the Ogre\"), a group of siblings come to an ogre's house who intends to kill them in their beds, but the youngest of the children exchanges the visitors with the ogre's offspring, and the villain kills his own children by mistake. They are chased by the ogre, but the siblings eventually manage to come back home safely.[24] Stith Thompson points the great similarity of the tales types ATU 327A and ATU 327B that \"it is quite impossible to disentangle the two tales\".[25] ATU 327C (\"The Devil [Witch] Carries the Hero Home in a Sack\") depicts a witch or an ogre catching a boy in a sack. As the villain's daughter is preparing to kill him, the boy asks her to show him how he should arrange himself; when she does so, he kills her. Later on, he kills the witch and goes back home with her treasure. In ATU 327D (\"The Kiddlekaddlekar\"), children are discovered by an ogre in his house. He intends to hang them, but the girl pretends not to understand how to do it, so the ogre hangs himself to show her. He promises his kiddlekaddlekar (a magic cart) and treasure in exchange for his liberation; they set him free, but the ogre chases them. The children eventually manage to kill him and escape safely. In ATU 327F (\"The Witch and the Fisher Boy\"), a witch lures a boy and catches him. When the witch's daughter tries to bake the child, he pushes her into the oven. The witch then returns home and eats her own daughter. She eventually tries to fell the tree in which the boy is hiding, but birds fly away with him.[24]"

The motif of the trail that fails to lead the protagonists back home is also common to \"Ninnillo and Nennella\", \"Finette Cendron\" and \"Hop-o'-My-Thumb\",[26] and the Brothers Grimm identified the latter as a parallel story.[27] Finally, ATU 327 tales share a similar structure with ATU 313 (\"Sweetheart Roland\", \"Foundling-Bird\", \"Okerlo\") in that one or more protagonists (specifically children in ATU 327) come into the domain of a malevolent supernatural figure and escape from it.[24] Folklorist Joseph Jacobs, commenting on his reconstructed proto-form of the tale (\"Johnnie and Grizzle\"), noticed the \"contamination\" of the tale with the story of \"The Master Maid\", later classified as ATU 313.[28] ATU 327A tales are also often combined with stories of ATU 450 (\"Little Brother and Sister\"), in which children run away from an abusive stepmother.[4]"

        "header": "Analysis",
        "content": "According to folklorist Jack Zipes, the tale celebrates the symbolic order of the patriarchal home, seen as a haven protected from the dangerous characters that threaten the lives of children outside, while it systematically denigrates the adult female characters, which are seemingly intertwined between each other.[6][29] The death of the mother or stepmother soon after the children kill the witch suggests that they may be metaphorically the same woman.[30] Zipes also argues that the importance of the tale in the European oral and literary tradition may be explained by the theme of child abandonment and abuse. Due to famines and lack of birth control, it was common in medieval Europe to abandon unwanted children in front of churches or in the forest. The death of the mother during childbirth sometimes led to tensions after remarriage, and Zipes proposes that it may have played a role in the emergence of the motif of the wicked stepmother.[29] Linguist and folklorist Edward Vajda has proposed that these stories represent the remnant of a coming-of-age, rite of passage tale extant in Proto-Indo-European society.[31][32] Psychologist Bruno Bettelheim argues that the main motif revolves around dependence, oral greed, and destructive desires that children must learn to overcome, after they arrive home \"purged of their oral fixations\". Others have stressed the satisfying psychological effects of the children vanquishing the witch or realizing the death of their wicked stepmother.[6]"

        "content": "The Carlton Complex Fire began as four relatively small fires (the Stokes Fire, the Gold Hikes Fire, the French Creek Fire and the Cougar Flat Fire) which were ignited by lightning strikes in the Methow Valley on July 14.[1] A low snowpack and lack of precipitation that spring, along with two weeks of high temperatures and low humidity had created an extreme fire risk in the region.[4] Three of the fires burned near the town of Carlton, and one near Pearrygin Lake State Park.[5] A smokejumper pilot based out of nearby Winthrop noticed the Gold Hikes fire in its early stages, but the Washington State Department of Natural Resources sent the crew to fight a wildfire in Oregon rather than contain the local fires.[6] By July 15, the Stokes Fire had grown to 600 acres (2.4\u00a0km2) and seven homeowners in the Carlton area had been advised to evacuate.[7] The following day, eleven homes in the Methow Valley were destroyed, and the fire jumped both the Methow River and Washington State Route 153.[8] The Federal Emergency Management Agency authorized the use of federal funds, and a national fire management team took control of the firefighting efforts.[8] Due to hot, dry conditions and wind gusts of up to 30 miles per hour (48\u00a0km/h), the fire grew significantly on July 17, expanding in all directions.[9] Plumes of smoke rose over 25,000 feet (7,600\u00a0m) in the air, large enough for the fire to generate its own weather. Embers picked up by the plume created spot fires up to 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) away.[4] The total size of the complex increased from about 18,000 acres (72.8\u00a0km2) that morning to 167,712 acres (678.7\u00a0km2) by the end of the day.[2] During a single nine-hour period, the fire grew at an average rate of 3.8 acres (15,000\u00a0m2) per second.[10] That evening, at around 8\u00a0pm Pacific Daylight Time, the fire reached the town of Pateros.[2] The town had been considered safe, as it is surrounded by a large 158-acre (0.6\u00a0km2) apple orchard, which would typically serve as a firebreak.[11] The Okanogan County Sheriff's Office placed the entire town under evacuation notice shortly before the fire arrived.[9] Sheriff's deputies and fire crews drove around town giving evacuation orders by megaphone.[11][12] The next day, the Sheriff's Office estimated that 95 homes in the area had been destroyed.[9] On July 18, the fires converged near Brewster, creating one large, continuous wildfire. The entire town of Malott was evacuated, as were some areas near Brewster and Winthrop.[13] Weather conditions helped to slow the growth of the fire over the next few days, although there was still very little containment by firefighters. Firefighting crews from around the country began to arrive, and there were 1,622 personnel working to suppress the fire by July 20.[14] Rain slowed the fire on July 24, allowing crews to reach 60% containment by July 26.[15] The number of firefighting personnel rose to around 3,000.[16] As firefighting efforts intensified and the weather continued to become cooler and more humid, crews were gradually able to control the fire. On August 24, over a month after the fires began, the Carlton Complex was declared 100% contained.[17]"

One man suffered a heart attack while protecting his home, and another never fully recovered after falling from a bulldozer while defending family property.[18] The fire surpassed the size of the 1902 Yacolt Burn in southwest Washington, making it the largest single fire in state history.[2] The following year, during the 2015 wildfire season, Okanogan County experienced another large complex of fires. The Okanogan Complex\u2014located slightly to the east of where the Carlton Complex had burned\u2014consumed an even greater amount of land, although it never converged into a single fire.[2] In October 2014, around 70 property owners filed property damage claims against the state worth a total of more than $9 million, alleging that the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) was negligent in responding to the fires, some of which began on DNR land. The claims were denied by the Washington Attorney General's office.[19]"

The land surrounding the falls was developed by Simon Benson in the early-twentieth century, with a pathway, viewing bridge, and adjacent lodge being constructed in 1925. The Multnomah Falls Lodge and the surrounding footpaths at the falls were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Contemporarily, the state of Oregon maintains a switchback trail that ascends to a talus slope 100 feet (30\u00a0m) above the falls, and descends to an observation deck that overlooks the falls' edge.

McArthur, in Oregon Geographic Names, suggested that S. G. Reed, a prominent mercantile clerk in Portland and native of Massachusetts, may have been the first to apply the name with the idea of popularizing sites along the Columbia River for steamboat excursions.[15]"

Lancaster recommended to the Progressive Business Men's Club of Portland that a trail be built from the base of Multnomah Falls extending to the top of Larch Mountain.[15] The Club raised several hundred dollars to finance the trail, and Portland financier Simon Benson and his son Amos S. Benson pledged an additional $3,000.[15] The United States Forest Service appropriated a total of $1,500 and agreed to survey and build the trail in addition to the lookout on Larch Mountain. Benson financed Italian stonemasons to construct a bridge at the falls to allow visitor access.[19] This bridge, named the Benson Footbridge, spans the lower falls at a height of 105 feet (32\u00a0m), and provides an expansive view of the upper falls.[15] On Labor Day 1915, Benson donated over 1,400 acres (570\u00a0ha) of land which included most of the falls as well as nearby Wahkeena Falls, to the city of Portland.[15]  The Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company subsequently donated the land at the base of Multnomah Falls contingent upon their agreement that a lodge would be constructed at the site the same year.[20] Late that year, architect A. E. Doyle, who designed Portland's Meier & Frank Building, was commissioned by the city to design the Multnomah Falls Lodge, which was completed in 1925.[17] The lodge, built in a \"Cascadian\" architectural style using native split fieldstone laid irregularly. The building features a steeply-pitched cedar-shingled gable roof with dormers and large chimneys.[15] In the early through the mid-twentieth century, the lodge provided both meals and lodging to travelers.[20] Contemporarily, it provides meals, a gift shop, and an interpretive center.[20] The lodge and footpaths were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.[17]"

Columbia Area Transit operates the Columbia Gorge Express to Portland and Hood River. During the summer season and holidays the parking lot along the freeway access can fill up very quickly which prompts a gate to come down and a reader board sign along the freeway before the offramp flashes that the parking lot is full.

It caused a 70-foot (21\u00a0m) splash of water and gravel to wash over the footbridge, causing minor injuries to twenty members of a wedding party that happened to be on the bridge posing for photos at the time.[26] On January 9, 2014, a falling rock damaged a portion of the bridge walkway and concrete railing, leading the Forest Service to close the bridge until repairs were completed.[27] In September 2017, the lodge was threatened by the Eagle Creek Fire in the Columbia River Gorge, which resulted in the lodge and fall access being closed to the public. The lodge reopened on November 29, 2017, though the U.S. Forest Service announced that footpath access to the waterfall would remain closed until an indeterminate date due to concerns over landslides.[28] The trail to the Benson Bridge reopened in June 2018,[29] while the remaining trails along upper Multnomah Creek and to Wahkeena Falls, the top of Larch Mountain, Devil's Rest, and Angel's Rest were repaired and reopened in November 2018.[30] "

He was raised in South Cle Elum, Washington, and attended Central Washington College of Education before volunteering for military service shortly before the United States entered World War II. Munro and his shipmate Raymond Evans were known as the Gold Dust Twins, so-called because they were inseparable.[3] During the Guadalcanal Campaign, Munro was assigned to Naval Operating Base Cactus at Lunga Point, where small boat operations were coordinated. At the Second Battle of the Matanikau in September 1942, he led the extrication of a force of Marines whose position had been overrun by Japanese forces. He died of a gunshot wound at age 22 while using the Higgins boat that he was piloting to shield a landing craft filled with Marines from Japanese fire. Several ships, buildings, and monuments have been dedicated to Munro, and a street in his hometown is named after him. The anniversary of his death is annually observed in Cle Elum and at Coast Guard Training Center Cape May. His grave has been designated a historical site by Washington state. He is the namesake of the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building, Munro Hall at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy,[4] the \"Douglas Munro March\", the Navy League's Douglas A. Munro Award, the Coast Guard Foundation's Douglas Munro Scholarship Fund, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars' Douglas Munro\u2013Robert H. Brooks Post. He is the only non-Marine to have his name enshrined on the Wall of Heroes of the National Museum of the Marine Corps."

He performed in a drum and bugle corps sponsored by the American Legion, the Sons of the American Legion Drum and Bugle Corps, eventually becoming the corps' drillmaster. Munro was also a member of Cle Elum's Boy Scout Troop 84. He attended Cle Elum High School, where he was a member of the school's wrestling team.[6]:\u200a8,\u200a16\u200a Following his 1937 high school graduation, Munro enrolled in the Central Washington College of Education due to its proximity to Cle Elum, so that he could continue performing in the Sons of the American Legion.[5]:\u200a2\u200a Munro was a yell king (a male cheerleader) at Central Washington.[6]:\u200a10\u200a[12] In 1939, with the threat of war growing, Munro decided to withdraw from college and enlist in the military.[6]:\u200a15\u200a He reportedly told his sister he had chosen the Coast Guard because its primary mission was saving lives. Slightly built, Munro spent the week before his induction eating heavily to meet the Coast Guard's minimum weight standard.[5]:\u200a2,\u200a3\u200a He spent most of his last night in Cle Elum with his friend Marion \"Mike\" Cooley, with whom, according to Munro's biographer, Gary Williams, he had been \"almost inseparable\" since childhood.[6]:\u200a16 Munro underwent entrance processing in Seattle, where he met and became friends with Ray Evans.[13] Munro would spend the rest of his Coast Guard career with Evans, and the pair became known to shipmates as \"the Gold Dust Twins\".[14][d]"

Munro and Evans volunteered for reassignment to the attack transport USS Hunter Liggett, which was being outfitted and manned by the Coast Guard as part of preparations for War Plan Orange.[13][16]:\u200a323\u201324\u200a[17][18] By mid-1942, Hunter Liggett had been assigned to Transport Division 17, tasked with supporting the Guadalcanal Campaign.[6]:\u200a41\u200a In preparation for the planned amphibious operations, Navy personnel began training as small boat handlers under Coast Guard tutelage; owing to the shortage of coxswains, Munro and Evans volunteered to join the training.[6]:\u200a78\u200a Prior to the initial landings at the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu\u2013Tanambogo, Munro was posted to Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner's staff aboard USS McCawley.[19]:\u200a14\u200a Cross-trained as both a coxswain and a signalman, he was ordered to ferry troops to shore during the third attack wave, then beach his boat and attach himself to a U.S. Marine unit to help manage ship-to-shore communication.[6]:\u200a95\u201396 Following the Allied victory at Tulagi and Gavutu\u2013Tanambogo, Munro and Evans were among Coast Guard and Navy personnel who staffed Naval Operating Base (NOB) Cactus at Lunga Point on the northern coast of Guadalcanal. NOB Cactus served as a communication hub between land forces and offshore vessels.[19]:\u200a14\u200a[20] Established on August 9 by Coast Guard Commander Dwight Dexter, NOB Cactus is the only known instance of a naval operating base primarily led by Coast Guard personnel.[21] Munro volunteered for assignment at Lunga Point; Dexter was his favorite officer.[22] According to U.S. Marine Master Sergeant James Hurlbut, Munro and Evans lived at the base in an approximately 80-square-foot (7.4\u00a0m2) hut \"they had made from packing boxes and scrap material\", which he also described as \"quite a swank establishment for Guadalcanal\".[23] On September 20, 1942, Munro volunteered to lead a small boat search-and-rescue mission seeking to recover the crew of a Navy airplane that had been forced down off Savo Island. During the operation, Munro's craft came under intense fire from Japanese shore positions, though he was able to maneuver the boat back to base with only minor injuries to his crew. The downed aircrew was ultimately found and rescued by a flying boat.[6]:\u200a42 On September 27, Lt. Colonel Chesty Puller ordered three companies of Marines to attack the flank of Japanese positions on the west side of the Matanikau River. Munro was placed in charge of two landing craft tank (LCT) and eight Higgins boats tasked with transporting the Marines to their landing points.[5]:\u200a4\u200a Preceded by a beach-clearing ship-to-shore bombardment from the destroyer USS\u00a0Monssen, the amphibious force landed and began moving inland towards its objective.[6]:\u200a47\u200a Meanwhile, Munro withdrew his boats to Lunga Point as ordered, carrying with him injured sailors and Marines, among them Navy coxswain Samuel B. Roberts, who had been mortally wounded while using his landing craft to draw Japanese fire away from the Marines.[5]:\u200a4\u200a[24] The U.S. Marine Corps landing force came under attack in a Japanese counteroffensive and quickly found itself encircled on a hill. With the Marines in danger of being overrun, Monssen opened fire on the Japanese positions with her 5-inch (127\u00a0mm) caliber guns, managing to clear a narrow corridor to the beach. Using Monssen's signal lamp, Puller ordered the Marines to fight their way to the shore.[25] At Lunga Point, the landing craft were instructed to return and extract the besieged Marines.[24] Commander Dexter asked Munro and Evans if they would take charge of the mission, to which Munro answered, \"Hell yes!\"[5]:\u200a4\u200a[24] As the boats under Munro's charge approached the recovery points, they came under heavy fire from the Japanese at a ridge abandoned by the Marines. Munro used a .30 caliber machine gun aboard his landing craft to direct suppressing fire against the enemy positions as the other boats recovered the Marines. With Japanese troops moving against the beach, Munro piloted his boat closer to shore to act as a shield. Though the initial extraction was successful, one of the LCTs became grounded on a sandbar. Munro directed the other LCT to help extricate the grounded vessel as he maneuvered his own boat to shield the Marines from Japanese fire from the shore. Munro was shot in the base of his skull and lost consciousness.[5]:\u200a4 The LCT was ultimately freed and the boats resumed their withdrawal. When out of range of Japanese forces, Munro briefly regained consciousness before succumbing to his wounds. According to Evans, his dying words were, \"Did they get off?\"[5]:\u200a4\u20135\u200a[10] Evans said later that \"... seeing my affirmative nod, he smiled with that smile I knew and liked so well, and then he was gone\".[24]"

A memorial service was held on November 1 at the Holy Nativity Episcopal Church in South Cle Elum. The Washington State Guard and American Legion volunteers provided sentries and a cordon of honor outside the church.[6]:\u200a168 Colonel Puller, the Marine officer who had ordered the attack in which Munro perished, nominated the Coast Guardsman for the Medal of Honor, the highest U.S. personal military decoration.[6]:\u200a64\u200a[24] The nomination was endorsed by Admiral William Halsey Jr., and President Franklin Roosevelt approved the decoration on or about May 1, 1943.[6]:\u200a64\u200a The medal was presented to Munro's parents on May 24 by Roosevelt in a White House ceremony.[10] The citation reads: For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty as Officer-in-Charge of a group of Higgins boats, engaged in the evacuation of a Battalion of Marines trapped by enemy Japanese forces at Point Cruz, Guadalcanal, on September 27, 1942. After making preliminary plans for the evacuation of nearly 500 beleaguered Marines, Munro, under constant risk of his life, daringly led five of his small craft toward the shore. As he closed the beach, he signaled the others to land, and then in order to draw the enemy's fire and protect the heavily loaded boats, he valiantly placed his craft with its two small guns as a shield between the beachhead and the Japanese. When the perilous task of evacuation was nearly completed, Munro was killed by enemy fire, but his crew, two of whom were wounded, carried on until the last boat had loaded and cleared the beach. By his outstanding leadership, expert planning, and dauntless devotion to duty, he and his courageous comrades undoubtedly saved the lives of many who otherwise would have perished. He gallantly gave up his life in defense of his country.[26] To date, Munro is the only member of the U.S. Coast Guard to have received the Medal of Honor.[27][28] Munro's remains were recovered from Guadalcanal in 1947 and were reinterred at Laurel Hill Memorial Park in Cle Elum in 1948, his family having declined a full military burial at the Arlington National Cemetery. In 1954, the City of Cle Elum expanded Munro's gravesite with the installation of two decommissioned Mk22 naval deck guns to either side of the tombstone.[5]:\u200a5\u200a[6]:\u200a95,\u200a97\u200a Munro's parents were later buried on either side of their son's grave at Laurel Hill.

An F1 tornado then injured one in rural Perry County, Missouri. Back in Illinois, another F3 tornado struck Vergennes, the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds in Southern Du Quoin, and Sesser, injuring 11.[1] As tornado activity wound down in the Midwest that evening, it quickly began to pick up in Alabama. An F2 tornado struck Leighton, Wheeler Darn Village, and Rogersville, killing one and injuring another. Later, another F2 tornado passed through areas just east of the killer tornado, causing mostly heavy tree damage in rural Lawrence and Limestone Counties.

        "content": " Typhoon Nabi (pronounced [na.bi]), known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Jolina, was a powerful typhoon that struck southwestern Japan in September 2005. The 14th named storm of the 2005 Pacific typhoon season, Nabi formed on August\u00a029 to the east of the Northern Mariana Islands. It moved westward and passed about 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) north of Saipan on August\u00a031 as an intensifying typhoon. On the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to super typhoon status, with winds equivalent to that of a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. The Japan Meteorological Agency estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on September\u00a02. Nabi weakened while curving to the north, striking the Japanese island of Kyushu on September\u00a06. After brushing South Korea, the storm turned to the northeast, passing over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September\u00a08, before dissipating on September\u00a012. The typhoon first affected the Northern Mariana Islands, where it left US$2.5\u00a0million in damage,[nb 1] while damaging or destroying 114\u00a0homes. The damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4\u00a0million in damage. About 250,000\u00a0people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left \u00a54.08\u00a0billion[nb 2] (US$36.9\u00a0million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322\u00a0mm (52.0\u00a0in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61\u00a0daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29\u00a0people and caused \u00a594.9\u00a0billion (US$854\u00a0million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon affected the Kuril Islands of Russia, where it dropped the equivalent of the monthly precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35\u00a0people."

        "content": "On August\u00a028, a large area of convection persisted about 1,035\u00a0km (643\u00a0mi) east of Guam. Located within an area of moderate wind shear, the system quickly organized while moving westward, its track influenced by a ridge to the north.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, a tropical depression formed from the system,[3] classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] as Tropical Depression 14W. In initial forecasts, the agency anticipated steady strengthening,[5] due to warm sea surface temperatures in the area.[6] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 4] upgraded it to a tropical storm.[7] As such, the JMA named the storm Nabi.[nb 5][2] About 12\u00a0hours later, the JMA upgraded Nabi further to a severe tropical storm,[3] after the convection organized into spiral rainbands.[6] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, Nabi intensified to typhoon status, reaching ten-minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[3] On August\u00a031, Nabi passed about 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) north-northeast of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands during its closest approach.[8] The typhoon continued to intensify quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September\u00a01, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a super typhoon and later estimated peak one-minute winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph); this is the equivalent of a Category\u00a05 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. By contrast, the JMA estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on September\u00a02, with a barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[2][3] While at peak intensity, the typhoon developed a large 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) wide eye.[9] For about 36\u00a0hours, Nabi maintained its peak winds, during which it crossed into the area of responsibility of PAGASA;[2][3] the Philippine-based agency gave it the local name \"Jolina\", although the storm remained away from the country.[2] On September\u00a03, Nabi began weakening as it turned more to the north, the result of an approaching trough weakening the ridge.[2] Later that day, the winds leveled off at 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), according to the JMA. On September\u00a05, Nabi passed near Kitadait\u014djima and Yakushima, part of the Dait\u014d and \u014csumi island groups offshore southern Japan.[7] Around that time, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon reintensified slightly to a secondary peak of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph).[3] After turning due north, Nabi made landfall near Isahaya, Nagasaki around 05:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, after passing through the Amakusa of Kumamoto.[10] Shortly thereafter, the storm entered the Sea of Japan.[7] The typhoon turned to the northeast into the mid-latitude flow, influenced by a low over the Kamchatka Peninsula.[11] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, the JTWC discontinued advisories on Nabi, declaring it extratropical,[12] although the JMA continued tracking the storm. On the next day, Nabi moved across northern Hokkaido into the Sea of Okhotsk. The JMA declared the storm as extratropical on September\u00a08, which continued eastward until the JMA ceased monitoring the storm's remnants on September\u00a010, while situated south of the Aleutian Islands.[7] The remnants of Nabi weakened and later moved into southwestern Alaska on September\u00a012, dissipating soon afterward.[13]"

The government of the Northern Mariana Islands advised Tinian and Saipan residents along the coast and in poorly-built buildings to evacuate, and several schools operated as shelters.[16] About 700\u00a0people evacuated on Saipan,[17] and the airport was closed, stranding about 1,000\u00a0travelers.[18] As a precaution, schools were closed on Guam on August\u00a031, after a tropical storm warning was issued for the island the night prior. The island's governor, Felix Perez Camacho, also declared a condition of readiness 2,[16] as well as a state of emergency.[19] Due to the typhoon, several flights were canceled or delayed at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam.[20] Ahead of the storm, United States Forces Japan evacuated planes from Okinawa to either Guam or mainland Japan to prevent damage.[21] Officials at the military bases on Okinawa advised residents to remain inside during the storm's passage. While Nabi was turning to the north, the island was placed under a Condition of Readiness 2.[22] At the military base in Sasebo, ships also evacuated,[23] and several buildings were closed after a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared.[24] In Kyushu, officials evacuated over a quarter of a million people in fear of Typhoon Nabi affecting Japan.[25] These continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides. The first order during the storm took place in the Arita district. In Miyazaki City, 21,483\u00a0households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river. Another 10,000\u00a0residences were vacated in Nobeoka following similar reports.[26] The entirety of the West Japan Railway Company was shut down.[2] Canceled train services affected 77,800\u00a0people on Shikoku.[27] Ferry service was also shut down, cutting off transportation for tens of thousands of people. In addition, at least 723\u00a0flights were cancelled because of the storm.[28] Japan's second-largest refinery, Idemitsu Kosan, stopped shipments to other refineries across the area, and Japan's largest refinery, Nippon Oil, stopped all sea shipments. The Cosmo Oil Company, Japan's fourth largest refinery, stopped all shipments to Yokkaichi and Sakaide refineries.[29] About 700\u00a0schools in the country were closed. Approximately 1,500\u00a0soldiers were dispatched to Tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi's arrival, and to clean up after the storm.[30] Officials in the Miyazaki Prefecture issued a flood warning for expected heavy rains in the area.[26] In South Korea, the government issued a typhoon warning for the southern portion of the country along the coast, prompting the airport at Pohang to close,[31] and forcing 162\u00a0flights to be canceled.[32] Ferry service was also disrupted,[32] and thousands of boats returned to port.[33] The storm also prompted 138\u00a0schools to close in the region.[32] Earlier, the storm spurred fears of a possible repeat of either typhoon Rusa in 2002 or Maemi in 2003, both of which were devastating storms in South Korea.[34] Officials in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning for Vladivostok, advising boats to remain at port.[35]"

Saipan International Airport reported sustained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph), with gusts to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Also on the island, Nabi produced 173\u00a0mm (6.8\u00a0in) of rainfall. The storm destroyed two houses and left 26\u00a0others uninhabitable, while 77\u00a0homes sustained minor damage, largely from flooding or roof damage. Nabi damaged 70\u201380% of the crops on Saipan and also knocked down many trees, leaving behind 544\u00a0tonnes (600\u00a0tons) of debris. The entire island was left without power, some without water, after the storm. On Tinian to the south, Nabi damaged or destroyed nine homes, with heavy crop damage. On Rota, there was minor flooding and scattered power outages. Farther south, the outer reaches of the storm produced sustained winds of 69\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph) at Apra Harbor on Guam, while gusts peaked at 101\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph) at Mangilao.[17] Gusts reached 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) at the international airport on Guam, the highest during 2005. The storm dropped 115\u00a0mm (4.5\u00a0in) of rainfall in 24\u00a0hours on the island.[36] Flooding covered roads for several hours and entered classrooms at Untalan Middle School, forcing hundreds of students to evacuate. Damage in the region was estimated US$2.5\u00a0million.[17] After Nabi exited the region, it produced high surf for several days on Guam and Saipan.[36] Later in its duration, Nabi brushed southeastern South Korea with rainbands.[2] Ulsan recorded a 24\u2011hour rainfall total of 319\u00a0mm (12.6\u00a0in),[2] while Pohang recorded a record 24\u2011hour total of 540.5\u00a0mm (21.28\u00a0in).[37] The highest total was 622.5\u00a0mm (24.51\u00a0in) of rainfall.[38] The periphery of the storm produced gusts of 121\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) in the port city of Busan,[33] strong enough to damage eight billboards and knock trees over.[2] Heavy rains caused several traffic accidents and injuries in Busan,[33] while strong waves washed a cargo ship ashore in Pohang.[2] Throughout South Korea, the storm led to six fatalities and caused US$115.4\u00a0million in damages.[39][38] In the Kuril Islands of Russia, Nabi dropped about 75\u00a0mm (3.0\u00a0in) of rain, equivalent to the monthly average. Gusts reached 83\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph), weak enough not to cause major damage. During the storm's passage, high waves washed away unpaved roads in Severo-Kurilsk.[40]"

There were minor power outages and some houses were damaged.[52] In the Amami Islands between Okinawa and mainland Japan, Nabi produced gusts of 122\u00a0km/h (76\u00a0mph) in Kikaijima.[53] Waves of 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in height affected Amami \u014cshima.[54] While moving through western Japan, Nabi dropped heavy rainfall that totaled 1,322\u00a0mm (52.0\u00a0in) over a three-day period in Miyazaki Prefecture,[53][55] the equivalent to nearly three times the average annual precipitation.[56] The same station in Miyazaki reported a 24\u2011hour rainfall total of 932\u00a0mm (36.7\u00a0in), as well as an hourly total of 66\u00a0mm (2.6\u00a0in).[53] Within the main islands of Japan, Nabi dropped 228.6\u00a0mm (9.00\u00a0in) of rainfall per hour in the capital Tokyo.[2] During the storm's passage, there were 61\u00a0daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan.[2] The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment displaced by the rains was estimated at 4,456\u00a0m3/km2, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630\u00a0m3 (22,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of driftwood was recorded.[57] However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures.[58][59] In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115\u00a0km/h (71\u00a0mph) in Muroto. A station on Tobishima in the Sea of Japan recorded a gust of 119\u00a0km/h (74\u00a0mph).[53] The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings.[60] In Wajima, Ishikawa, Nabi produced a Foehn wind, causing temperatures to rise quickly.[61] Throughout Japan, Nabi caused damage in 31 of the 47\u00a0prefectures,[62] leaving over 270,000\u00a0residences without power.[2] Torrential rains caused flooding and landslides throughout the country.[63] The storm destroyed 7,452\u00a0houses and flooded 21,160\u00a0others.[53] Several car assembly plants were damaged in southwestern Japan,[2] while others were closed due to power outages, such as Toyota, Mazda, and Mitsubishi.[64] In addition, the storm wrecked about 81\u00a0ships along the coast.[53] On the island of Kyushu, damage in \u014cita Prefecture on Kyushu reached \u00a511.7\u00a0billion (US$106\u00a0million), the fifth highest of any typhoon in the preceding 10\u00a0years; about 20% of the total there was related to road damages.[65] In nearby Saga Prefecture, crop damage totaled about \u00a51.06\u00a0billion (US$9.6\u00a0million), mostly to rice but also to soybeans and various other vegetables.[66] Crop damage as a whole on Kyushu totaled \u00a54.08\u00a0billion (US$36.9\u00a0million).[56] In the capital city of Tokyo, heavy rainfall increased levels along several rivers, which inundated several houses.[67] Strong winds damaged \u00a528.8\u00a0million (US$259,000) in crop damage in Gifu Prefecture,[68] and \u00a527.1\u00a0million (US$244,000) in crop damage in Osaka.[69] In Yamaguchi Prefecture on western Honshu, Nabi damaged a portion of the historical Kintai Bridge, originally built in 1674.[70] In Yamagata Prefecture, the winds damaged a window in a school, injuring several boys from the debris.[71] One person was seriously injured in Kitakata, Fukushima after strong winds blew a worker from scaffolding of a building under construction.[72] Effects from Nabi spread as far north as Hokkaido, where heavy rainfall damaged roads and caused hundreds of schools to close.[73] In Ashoro, an overflown river flooded a hotel,[74] and a minor power outage occurred in Teshikaga.[75] Ahead of the storm, high waves and gusty winds led to one drowning when a woman was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu, Kagawa. A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes,[76] killing three people. A man who was listed as missing was found dead in a flooded rice field. In Tarumi, a landslide buried a home in mud, killing two people.[63] Nabi caused a portion of the San'y\u014d Expressway to collapse in Yamaguchi Prefecture, killing three people.[67] In Fukui Prefecture, the winds knocked an elderly man off a bicycle, killing him.[77] Overall, Nabi killed 29\u00a0people in Japan and injured 179\u00a0others, 45 of them severely. Damage was estimated at \u00a594.9\u00a0billion (US$854\u00a0million).[53]"

Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with \u00a512.6\u00a0billion (US$11.4\u00a0million). The total was split between \u00a549\u00a0billion (US$44\u00a0million) in housing claims and \u00a57.9\u00a0billion (US$71\u00a0million) in car claims.[82] The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas in the days after the storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.[83] On November\u00a08, nearly two months after the dissipation of Typhoon Nabi, President George W. Bush declared a major disaster declaration for the Northern Mariana islands. The declaration allocated aid from the United States to help restore damaged buildings, pay for debris removal, and other emergency services. Federal funding was also made available on a cost-sharing basis for the islands to mitigate against future disasters.[84] The government ultimately provided $1,046,074.03 to the commonwealth.[85] Due to the similar pronunciation to the word \"prophets\" in Arabic, and the conflict of religious views,[86] the Typhoon Committee of the World Meteorological Organization agreed to retire the name Nabi. The agency replaced it with the name Doksuri, effective January\u00a01, 2007,[87] and was first used during the 2012 Pacific typhoon season."

        "content": " Typhoon Sarika, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Karen, was a powerful tropical cyclone which affected the Philippines, South China, and Vietnam in mid-October 2016. The twenty-first named storm and the tenth typhoon of the annual Pacific typhoon season, Sarika developed from a tropical disturbance east of the Philippines on October\u00a013. The system steadily strengthened as it traveled westwards, becoming a tropical storm later that day and then a typhoon on October\u00a015. Rapid intensification commenced as Sarika turned to the west-northwest towards Luzon, reaching its peak intensity just before making landfall in Aurora early on October\u00a016. Sarika weakened significantly as it crossed land, emerging over the South China Sea as a minimal typhoon, then weakening further to a severe tropical storm on October\u00a017. Sarika maintained its strength for the rest of the day and made landfall in Hainan province in China on October\u00a018. Turning to the northwest, Sarika weakened quickly as it emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin, before moving onshore once again in Guangxi province on October\u00a019. The system dissipated shortly after. Sarika produced significant impacts in the Philippines as a strong typhoon. Strong winds and flooding rainfall caused landslides, power outages, and disruptions of telecommunications services. Nearly 13,000\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed, and more than 200,000\u00a0people were displaced. Agricultural damage in the Philippines was severe, totaling \u20b13.63\u00a0billion (US$76.4\u00a0million).[nb 1] Damage to infrastructure was valued at \u20b1226\u00a0million (US$4.76\u00a0million). No fatalities occurred, though several mountaineers and sailors were rescued. While not as strong at subsequent landfalls in China, Sarika combined with the northeast monsoon to produce heavy rains across South China and northeast Vietnam. Hong Kong saw its October hourly rainfall record broken by thunderstorms from Sarika on October\u00a019. A person went missing after a boat capsized near Wang Chau Island. Gusty winds and torrential rains affected Hainan, Guangxi, and Guangdong. In particular, Sarika was the strongest October typhoon to hit Hainan since 1971, where nearly 6,000\u00a0houses were damaged, 130,000\u00a0people lost access to telecommunications services, and almost 381,000 hectares (940,000 acres) of banana, cassava, papaya, and rubber crops were impacted. Direct economic losses in the province reached \u00a54.56\u00a0billion (US$686\u00a0million). Another 165,000 hectares (410,000 acres) of crops were damaged in Guangxi and Guangdong. In total, Sarika killed at least one person and caused economic losses reaching US$894\u00a0million."

        "content": "Sarika was first noted by the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as a disorganized tropical disturbance on October\u00a011, while it was about 1,050\u00a0km (650\u00a0mi) southeast of Manila.[2] The system quickly consolidated within a favorable environment of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures of about 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), leading the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[3] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a013, the system's low-level circulation center became increasingly symmetric as it tracked northwestwards and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression.[4][5][nb 2] The JTWC followed suit six hours later.[7] Intensification slowed thereafter as an upper-level anticyclone suppressed outflow on the eastern side of the system. However, the system managed to intensify into a tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a013 as it traveled west-northwestwards along a subtropical ridge.[8][4][7] At this point, the system was given the name Sarika by the JMA.[9][nb 3] The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which had been tracking the storm since October\u00a012, assigned it the local name Karen.[11] On October\u00a014, the anticyclone that had been hampering outflow diminished, allowing the system to once again quickly gain organization.[12] The system intensified into a severe tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC, and then a typhoon at 00:00\u00a0UTC the next day.[4] As Sarika traversed warm seas with surface temperatures reaching 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F),[13] the system developed a small, well-defined eye that was apparent on both infrared and microwave satellite imagery, signalling the onset of rapid intensification.[14] Sarika reached peak intensity as a very strong typhoon at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, assessed by the JMA to have sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 935\u00a0hPa (27.61\u00a0inHg).[4][nb 4] The JTWC simultaneously assessed Sarika to have winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category\u00a04 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[7] Just half an hour later, Sarika made its first landfall near Baler, Aurora in the Philippines.[16] Significant weakening occurred in the six hours that Sarika traversed Luzon as the mountainous terrain disrupted its circulation,[17] with the JMA and JTWC estimating that winds fell to 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[4][7] The system recovered a ragged eye as it continued west-northwest under the influence the subtropical ridge,[18] and exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility on October\u00a016.[19] Despite continued favorable conditions, Sarika struggled to reintensify as its eye remained ragged,[20] with the JMA assessing that it weakened further to a severe tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a017.[4] The JTWC, however, maintained that the system remained a typhoon as it crossed the South China Sea.[7] The broad system turned northwest late on October\u00a017 as it began to round the subtropical ridge.[20] At 01:50\u00a0UTC on October\u00a018, Sarika made landfall on Hainan Island near Hele, Wanning with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) according to the JMA.[21][4] Bringing wind gusts of 162\u00a0km/h (101\u00a0mph) to the island, Sarika became the strongest October typhoon to impact Hainan since 1971.[22] The system weakened quickly into a tropical storm as it moved across Hainan,[4] before emerging into the Gulf of Tonkin at 16:00\u00a0UTC.[22] Sarika's convective structure continued to fall apart,[23] and the system weakened into a tropical depression prior to its final landfall near Fangchenggang, Guangxi at 06:10\u00a0UTC on October\u00a019.[4][22] Sarika dissipated inland over Guangxi before 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a020.[4]"

Power interruptions occurred in several regions; 246,000\u00a0people in Catanduanes were left without power at the height of the storm.[51][16] Communication towers belonging to PLDT were downed in Agoo, La Union. Smart Communications experienced partial loss of its services in Aurora, while Globe Telecom experienced significant loss of service across Southern Luzon. Water supplies were disrupted in Tagkawayan, Quezon, as well as parts of Pamplona, Camarines Sur. Across the Philippines, roads were blocked in 48\u00a0places and 23\u00a0bridges were rendered impassable by floods, landslides, and rockslides. Floods occurred in 122\u00a0barangays in the provinces of Panganiban, Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, and Bataan.[16] The Bustos, Ambuklao, and Magat dams opened their floodgates as their water levels neared or overshot the normal high water level.[52] A total of 12,777\u00a0homes were damaged, of which 1,421 were completely destroyed. Damage to infrastructure totaled \u20b1226\u00a0million (US$4.76\u00a0million).[16] The adverse weather conditions necessitated several land and sea rescues. In the waters off Catbalogan, Samar, strong winds and large waves capsized a service vessel carrying eleven people on October\u00a014, and partially sank another boat carrying five people on October\u00a015. Everyone on board the two vessels was brought to safety. A group of 16\u00a0mountaineers stranded on Mount Pulag were rescued on October\u00a016. Another 100\u00a0mountaineers were rescued in the vicinity of Mount Tarak, near Mariveles, Bataan.[29] Three people were rescued from a flash flood in San Andres, Quezon. Search and rescue teams rescued 100\u00a0families in Lagonoy, Camarines Sur.[16] According to the NDRRMC, no fatalities occurred in relation to Sarika in the Philippines.[53][nb 5] Significant crop damage occurred in the Philippines from the combined effects of Sarika and Typhoon Haima, which struck Northern Luzon a week later. Roughly 394,470 hectares (974,800 acres) of paddy fields were affected \u2013 about 15% of the national total. Only 12,118 hectares (29,940 acres) were lost, however, meaning that the typhoons had limited impact on national rice production. Maize and high value crops were also affected, though to a much smaller extent since the harvest had mostly completed in September.[55] Livestock losses and damage to irrigation systems occurred mainly in the Bicol Region. Agricultural damage in the Philippines attributed to Sarika reached \u20b13.63\u00a0billion (US$76.4\u00a0million).[16]"

An area of disturbed weather developed within the vicinity of the Caroline Islands during the second week of July. A tropical depression developed southeast of Guam on July\u00a012, and on the next day, intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking generally west-northwest, Warren deepened into a typhoon on July\u00a014. The storm subsequently entered a period of rapid intensification, commencing with Warren reaching its highest intensity on July\u00a016. The following evening, the typhoon brushed Luzon, resulting in a weakening trend, although Warren was still a typhoon when it made landfall near Shantou. Warren rapidly dissipated inland. Across the Philippines, 3,560 houses were damaged and 21,329 more were destroyed, displacing 19,224 families. Six people were killed and damage was estimated at US$11.4\u00a0million. In Hong Kong, severe flooding occurred, especially in low-lying areas, several trees were downed, and there were reports of five landslides. There, 13 people were injured.

        "content": "Typhoon Warren developed from an area of disorganized convection in the eastern Caroline Islands that was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on July\u00a011. An increase in organization and improved upper-level outflow promoted the JTWC to raise its development chances. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system, which was located around 330\u00a0km (205\u00a0mi) southeast of Guam, at 05:30\u00a0UTC on July\u00a012.[2] Shortly thereafter, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the system a tropical depression[3][nb 2][nb 3] At noon, satellite images showed a central dense overcast and satellite intensity estimates supported winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). At 16:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a012, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical depression. Tracking westward, the depression passed within 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) north of Guam. On the morning of July 13, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Warren by the JTWC,[2] although post-storm analysis revealed that the depression actually became a tropical storm late on July\u00a012.[6] At 00:00 UTC on July 14, the JMA declared the system a tropical storm,[6] with the JTWC upgrading Warren to a typhoon that evening.[2] Tracking west-northwestward[7] while also accelerating, Warren continued to gradually deepen. On the morning of July\u00a015, the JMA designated Warren a severe tropical storm.[3] At the time of the upgrade, Warren was located around 1,360\u00a0km (845\u00a0mi) east of Manila.[7] Twenty-four hours later, the JMA upped Warren into a typhoon.[3] Around this time, the storm entered a rapid intensification phase, with the JTWC estimating that Warren reached its peak intensity of 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph), equal to a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, on July\u00a016.[2] Around the same time, the JMA estimated that Warren achieved its peak intensity of 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[3] While tracking across the Philippine Sea, many tropical cyclone forecast models showed Warren tracking northward near Taiwan and eventually recurving out to sea. Forecasters at the JTWC continued to predict a westward motion because satellite imagery and mid-level synoptic analysis showed a subtropical ridge to its north.[2] According to the JTWC, the typhoon weakened slightly on July\u00a017, though data from the JMA suggested that Warren maintained its maximum intensity[6] until Warren skirted Luzon that evening. Land interaction resulted in some weakening,[2] with the JTWC and JMA lowering the intensity of the typhoon to 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018.[6] After entering the South China Sea,[7] Warren made landfall near the city of Shantou on the morning of July\u00a019.[2] At the time, the JTWC estimated winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) while the JMA reported winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[6] The storm rapidly weakened overland, and the storm dissipated on July\u00a020 over the province of Guangdong.[7]"

As of August 4, 2022, there have been four large wildfires that have burned 30,800 acres (12,500\u00a0ha) across the US state of Washington. This season started quieter than normal due to unusually colder weather that kept Eastern and Southeastern Washington burning index's largely below normal into July.[1] As of October 2022, a total of 140,000 acres (57,000\u00a0ha) of land in the state was burned \u2013 the fewest number of acres burned since 2012.[2]"

The weather conditions contributed to the initiation and expansion of fires on the west slopes of the Cascades,[16] and the worst air quality of the season so far occurred in Seattle that weekend.[17] Fires included the Nakia Creek Fire in Southwest Washington and one on private timberland near Loch Katrine in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness 30 miles east of Seattle.[18][19] Flames from the Loch Katrine fire could be seen from Seattle.[20] On October 18 and 19, due to wildfire smoke, Seattle had the worst air quality of any major city in the world.[21]"

The largest fire of the season, the East Fork Fire, burned an area of 89,568 acres.[6] In total, the suppression costs for the fires amounted to at least $103 million (2020 USD).[4] Of the 1,547[1] fires in Utah during 2020, 1,202 (78%) were human-caused, surpassing 2015's record of 937. These fires accounted for nearly 100,000 of the 329,732 total acres burned during this season.[7] The significant rise in human-caused fires was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, as it forced recreation outside at higher rates.[8]"

Soudelor had severe impacts in the Northern Mariana Islands, Taiwan, and eastern China, resulting in 40\u00a0confirmed fatalities. Lesser effects were felt in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. The thirteenth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Soudelor formed as a tropical depression near Pohnpei on July 29. The system strengthened slowly at first before entering a period of rapid intensification on August 2. Soudelor made landfall on Saipan later that day, causing extensive damage. Owing to favorable environmental conditions, the typhoon further deepened and reached its peak intensity with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) and a central atmospheric pressure of 900 hPa (mbar; 26.58\u00a0inHg) on August 3. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed one-minute sustained winds at 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph), making Soudelor a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon. Steady weakening ensued thereafter as the storm moved generally west-northwest. Soudelor made landfall over Hualien, Taiwan, late on August 7 and emerged over in the Taiwan Strait early the next day. The typhoon soon moved inland over eastern China and degraded to a tropical depression by August 9. Soudelor was the second worst storm to strike Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands in nearly 30\u00a0years (following Typhoon Yutu of 2018). Hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed and power was expected to take a month to restore. Two people died in Guam due to rip currents. In Taiwan, torrential rains and destructive winds caused widespread damage and disruptions. A record-breaking 4.85\u00a0million households lost power on the island. At least 8\u00a0people died and 420\u00a0others sustained injury there; a ninth person died in the storm's aftermath. Portions of eastern China saw their heaviest rains in 100\u00a0years, resulting in deadly floods and landslides. Typhoon Soudelor killed 45 people in eastern China after parts of the country were hit by the heaviest rains in a century. Total economic losses were counted to be \u00a524.627\u00a0billion (US$3.97\u00a0billion).[1]"

        "content": "On July 28, 2015, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 1] began monitoring a tropical disturbance about 415\u00a0km (258\u00a0mi) north of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The system featured a developing low level circulation accompanied by deep convection.[3] Moving generally west under the influence of a subtropical ridge,[4] the disturbance gradually organized amid favorable environmental conditions. A tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell enhanced upper-level outflow, offsetting the negative effects of moderate wind shear; high sea surface temperatures and ocean heat content provided ample energy for further development.[5] At 14:30\u00a0UTC on July 29, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system.[6] Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] began monitoring the system as a weak tropical depression;[8] the agency began full advisories on the system at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July 30.[9] The JTWC followed suit later that day, designating the system as Tropical Depression 13W.[10] The cyclone achieved tropical storm intensity by 12:00\u00a0UTC, at which time it was assigned the name Soudelor, a title of legendary rulers in the Pohnpeian language.[11][12][13] A central dense overcast developed over the circulation center shortly thereafter.[14] Some structural degradation took place on July 31 owing to subsidence from a TUTT cell to the north.[15][16] Following a retreat of the TUTT cell northward,[17] Soudelor's convective structure improved with well-defined banding features wrapping into the circulation by August 1.[18] The organizing storm, with a redeveloped central dense overcast, soon entered a region favoring rapid intensification, including low wind shear, sea surface temperatures of 31\u201332\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u201390\u00a0\u00b0F) and high ocean heat content.[19] Therefore, the JMA upgraded Soudelor to a severe tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[20] Rapid intensification ensued on August 2 as the storm approached the Northern Mariana Islands with both agencies classifying Soudelor as a typhoon.[21][22][23] The typhoon developed an unusually small eye only 8\u00a0km (5.0\u00a0mi) in diameter, among the smallest ever observed in a tropical cyclone. At 14:54\u00a0UTC, Soudelor made landfall along the southern coast of Saipan.[21] After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle,[24] Soudelor continued rapid intensification, reaching peak intensity on August 3. The JMA estimated peak ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 900\u00a0hPa (27\u00a0inHg),[25] while the JTWC estimated peak one-minute maximum sustained winds of 285\u00a0km/h (177\u00a0mph), classifying Soudelor as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon. Intensity leveled off thereafter, and after maintaining Category 5 intensity for 24 hours, Soudelor was downgraded to a Category 4 super typhoon late on August 4.[26] On August 5, PAGASA reported that the Typhoon Soudelor entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility assigning the name Hanna.[27] Soudelor weakened further to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon and stayed at that intensity for a day. On August 7, the typhoon reintensified to reach a secondary peak as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon,[26] and later that day, Typhoon Soudelor made landfall over Xiulin, Hualien in Taiwan at 20:40 UTC on August 7 (04:40 TST on August 8), and it arrived in the Taiwan Strait from Taixi, Yunlin around 03:00 UTC (11:00 TST) on August 8.[28][29] Around 14:10 UTC (22:10 CST) on the same day, Soudelor made landfall over Xiuyu District, Putian, Fujian in China as a Category 1-equivalent typhoon.[30][31] Quickly degrading, Soudelor moved erratically northwest. 24 hours after landfall, Soudelor was downgraded to a depression, before becoming extratropical six hours later The remnants re-looped eastward, before briefly re-attaining gale-force winds as it moved offshore near Yancheng, Jiangsu. The remnants were last noted on August 13, affecting Kyushu and Ch\u016bgoku region.[citation needed]"

The island's power plant lost part of its roof and was flooded.[37] Damage to the island's electrical infrastructure was tremendous, with 150\u00a0power poles and 114\u00a0transformers damaged or destroyed.[38] A total of 464\u00a0residents sought refuge in public shelters.[39] Acting Governor Ralph DLG Torres declared \"a state of disaster and significant emergency\". Philip Dauterman of the Commonwealth Health Center in Saipan likened damage to that caused by Typhoon Pongsona which struck Guam in December 2002.[37] In addition, John Hirsh from the American Red Cross said that Soudelor is the most damaging cyclone to hit Saipan since Typhoon Kim in 1986 struck the island nearly thirty years prior.[40] Initial assessments by the Emergency Operations Center indicate that 384\u00a0homes were destroyed. A separate assessment by the American Red Cross showed 808\u00a0homes affected. Of this total, 158\u00a0were destroyed, 296\u00a0sustained major damage, and 354\u00a0were affected or sustained minor damage.[41] Total damage exceeded US$21\u00a0million (2015 USD) on Saipan. Forty people were injured across the island.[34] On August 8 and 9, two people drowned in separate rip current incidents in western Guam.[42] The local power company, Commonwealth Utilities Corp., stated they only had 77\u00a0replacement power poles and no transformers. Repairs to the electric grid, water supply network, and wastewater systems were expected to take three to four weeks.[38] Three Mobil gas stations re-opened on August 4 for first responders and emergency services.[43] Relief supplies from Guam and Hawaii were sent to Saipan that day. Members of the Guam National Guard, Guam Power Authority, and the Coast Guard also provided assistance.[39] On August 6, United States President Barack Obama declared the Northern Mariana Islands a federal disaster area, allowing residents to receive government aid. Saipan was granted individual assistance while Tinian and Rota received public assistance.[44][45] By September, the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved US$25.9\u00a0million in aid to residents of Saipan.[46]"

Ishigaki Island saw a peak gust of 198\u00a0km/h (123\u00a0mph). Farther north at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa Island, gusts reached 84\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph). Heavy rains accompanied these winds, with Yonaguni reporting 451\u00a0mm (17.74\u00a0in) during the storm's passage.[47] Structural impact was relatively minor, mainly confined to damaged roofs on Yonaguni island. Three people sustained minor injuries in the region.[48] Losses to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries across the Yaeyama District reached \u00a5360\u00a0million (US$2.9\u00a0million). A total of 6,748 hectares (16,670 acres) of crops sustained damage.[49] In Miyako-jima, crops sustained significant damage from salt; relatively little rain coupled with strong winds allowed sea spray to travel farther inland than normal. Preliminary estimates placed losses at \u00a594.52\u00a0million (US$761,000).[50] On August 10, a family of four was swept out to sea near Irabu-jima by residual swells from the typhoon; three drowned while the fourth, an 8-year-old girl, was rescued.[51]"

Additionally, 420\u00a0people sustained injuries.[54] All 279 domestic flights were canceled on August 8, as well as at least 37 international flights.[55] The center of the storm made landfall in eastern Taiwan at 04:40\u00a0a.m. local time on August 8. By mid-morning, Soudelor had maximum sustained winds of 173\u00a0km/h (107\u00a0mph; 93\u00a0kn), according to Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau (CWB).[56] Northern and mountainous areas of Taiwan saw the strongest winds, with Pengjia Islet reporting sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and a peak gust of 211\u00a0km/h (131\u00a0mph). A gust of 230\u00a0km/h (143\u00a0mph) was reported in Su'ao; however, this value was later retracted by the CWB due to possible accuracy concerns. Taoyuan International Airport in Taoyuan reported a gust of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[47] These winds caused Taipei 101's tuned mass damper to sway a record 100\u00a0cm (39\u00a0in).[57] Taiping Mountain in eastern Taiwan's Yilan County saw the heaviest rains from the typhoon, with accumulations peaking at 1,334\u00a0mm (52.52\u00a0in).[47][56] Rainfall in the Wulai District reached 722\u00a0mm (28.4\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours, the second-highest on record behind Typhoon Matsa in 2005. Twelve-hour accumulations amounted to a record 632\u00a0mm (24.9\u00a0in).[58] At the height of the storm, 4.85\u00a0million households lost electricity.[54] This was the largest blackout on record in Taiwan due to a typhoon, surpassing the previous record of 2.79\u00a0million after Typhoon Herb in 1996.[59] Water supply to 429,248\u00a0homes and land line telephone service to 64,992\u00a0homes was cut during the storm.[54] A contaminated Nanshi River suffered a drastic overflow, and soon mixed with the primary water source of the Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area.[60] The river's turbidity reached record levels in just two hours, catching Taipei's Water Department off-guard.[58] The excess water overwhelmed the regional purification system. As a result, the water supply to approximately 5\u00a0million households in Taipei was polluted for the next few days.[61] Agricultural damage in Taiwan exceeded NT$3.03\u00a0billion (US$94.8\u00a0million). The banana crop suffered the greatest impact, with 5,436 hectares (13,430 acres) damaged; losses from the crop reached NT$460.15\u00a0million (US$14.3\u00a0million).[62] Six windmills of Taipower were destroyed.[63] Approximately 100\u00a0people were listed as missing after contact was lost with Xiaoyi village (Siaoyi) in Wulai District of New Taipei City during the storm on August 8. Reports from firefighters dispatched to search for residents reported that homes in the area had \"disappeared\" following a large landslide.[64][65] All residents were later accounted for on August 10.[66] A soldier was crushed to death while trying to clear debris on August 13.[67]"

At 5:59 pm on August 15, the McDougall Creek fire was discovered and reported to B.C. Wildfire Services about 10 km northwest of West Kelowna. On the evening of August 17, 2023, a constant wind gust caused the wildfire to rapidly spread across the mountains. At 1:25 pm PT on August 17, the evacuation alert was expanded, and an evacuation order was issued by the City of West Kelowna for 68 properties. Throughout the evening of August 17, further evacuation orders were issued by emergency officials. At around 9:55 pm, August 17, the wildfire jumped over Okanagan Lake sparking new wildfires north of Kelowna forcing a state of emergency by the city and further evacuations.[5][6] Just after 10:20 am PT, August 18, Kelowna International Airport announced that they were suspending flights to and from the airport until further notice.[7] Just after 6:15 pm, August 18, the province declared a state of emergency due to the changing and worsening fire condition. The province also advised against nonessential travel to the BC Interior.[8] On August 19, the province announced in a ministerial order that non-essential travels into the B.C. Interior and southeast B.C. would be restricted[9] until September 4, 2023. The order restricts accommodations such as hotels, inns, motels, provincial parks, RV parks, bed and breakfasts, and public campgrounds in West Kelowna, Kelowna, Kamloops, Osoyoos, Oliver, Penticton, and Vernon to essential purposes only.[10] On August 23, the province lifted most wildfire-related travel restrictions in the southern interior, with the exception of West Kelowna. Bowinn Ma, Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness, urged people to continuously avoid fire-affected communities and respect evacuation orders and alerts.[11] As of September 1, the wildfire was estimated at 13,712 hectares in size and still classified as out of control. The wildfire was still actively burning along the west and southwest flanks.[12] On September 21, the B.C. Wildfire Services reported that the wildfire was \"being held\" and that was fire was \"not likely to spread past predetermined boundaries under current conditions.\"[13] The area restriction order remained in place until October 3. However, four regional district parks remained closed to the public.[14]"

An area of disturbed weather formed several hundred kilometers south-southeast of Okinawa on September 18. Gradual development occurred as it tracked generally westward, and on September 22, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression. The depression intensified into a tropical storm the next day. Continuing to steadily intensify, Gene turned northwest and became a severe tropical storm on September 25. In the evening, Gene was declared a typhoon, and on September 26, attained its maximum intensity. Gene leveled off in intensity while recurving towards Japan. After brushing Kyushu and Shikoku on September 29 and Honshu on September 20, Gene weakened back to a tropical storm. On September 30, Gene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which was last noted on October 1. The typhoon hit the Japanese archipelago ten days after Typhoon Flo, which killed 40 people. The southwestern portion of the country suffered the worst damage from the typhoon. Nationwide, six fatalities were reported and twenty others sustained injuries. In Miyazaki Prefecture, three people were killed and ten others were wounded. Throughout the prefecture, 4,688 houses were damaged and ninety-two others were destroyed, which led to 18,449 homeless. A total 210 houses were destroyed while 13,318 others were flooded. Elsewhere, 229 houses were damaged in Kagoshima Prefecture and seventy more were destroyed; consequently, 194 people lost their homes. There, almost 30,000 homes lost power. Overall, there were 340 landslides and roads were damaged at 182 locations. All Nippon Airways cancelled ninety domestic flights and Japan Airlines cancelled ten flights. Over 200,000 people were affected by cancellation of flights and train services. Thirty-one ships and 10,560 acres (4,270 hectares) of farmland were damaged.

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Gene, the fifth tropical cyclone of September 1990, can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather with a surface pressure of 1008\u00a0mbar (29.8\u00a0inHg) first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 06:00 UTC early on September 18. Little development occurred over the next five days,[1] although the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the disturbance as a tropical depression on the morning of September 22.[2][nb 1] A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued at 06:00 UTC on September 23, followed by an increase in the disturbance's organization.[1] Around that time, the system was located roughly 1,170\u00a0km (725\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Okinawa.[4] Further development was aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to its west and the warm ocean waters of the Kuroshio Current. Initially, the disturbance tracked generally westward, south of a subtropical ridge. Shower activity steadily increased and a Dvorak estimate of T2.0/55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) prompted the JTWC to designate it a tropical depression midday on September 23.[1] Twelve hours later, the JMA reported that the depression had strengthened into a tropical storm,[5][nb 2] and after the system improved in organization and its outflow expanded,[1] the JTWC followed suit.[7] At this time, Tropical Storm Gene was situated 980\u00a0km (610\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Okinawa.[4] Tropical Storm Gene intensified at the climatological rate of one T number per day as it tracked westward on a course initially resembling a straight runner.[1] At 00:00 UTC on September 25, the JMA classified Gene as a severe tropical storm.[2] The storm then turned northwest as it approached a break in the subtropical ridge. Although restricted upper-level outflow prevented rapid intensification, a Dvorak intensity estimate of T4.0/120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph)[1] lead to both agencies to declare Gene a typhoon on the evening of September 25.[5] Around the time of the upgrade, Gene was located 380\u00a0km (235\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Okinawa.[4] At 00:00 UTC on September 26, the JMA raised its intensity to 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) for its maximum sustained winds, while the agency also estimated a minimum pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg).[2] However, the JTWC suggested that Gene was still slowly strengthening, and did not attain its maximum intensity of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) until 18:00 UTC that day.[7] Gene recurved to the northeast on September 27 in response to a shortwave trough[1] while passing through the Ryukyu Islands.[4] According to the JTWC, Gene maintained its peak intensity until 06:00 UTC on September 29,[1] although the JMA estimated that a weakening trend had begun six hours earlier.[2] The typhoon continued to recurve and skirted Kyushu and Shikoku on September 29 before tracking just south of Honshu the following day.[4] Based on surface observations, the JTWC downgraded Gene into a tropical storm at 06:00 UTC that day,[1] with the JMA doing the same at around the same time. The JMA classified Gene as an extratropical cyclone at noon,[2] even though the JTWC did not follow suit until six hours later.[1] Finally, the JMA stopped tracking the extratropical remnants of Gene on October 1.[5]"

Aircraft with water and firefighters controlled the fire.[2] Estimates suggest that 5,000 hectares of forest and bush were affected in the Sierra Cabrera mountain range between Turre and Moj\u00e1car in Spain on 14\u201315 July. 500 people were evacuated, as dozens of firefighters and soldiers controlled the fires, including the use of five helicopters and three aircraft.[citation needed] On 23 July, the fires on the Sierra Cabrera on which Moj\u00e1car sits flared again, causing damage to the village and other houses in the area and the evacuation of around 1,500 residents.[1] Outside the French city of Marseille, 1,300 hectares (3211 acres) were destroyed.[1] In Corsica, wildfires led to the destruction of approximately 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) of bush and forest resulting in the injuries of five firemen.[1] More than 320 wildfires affected patches of forest across Greece, although they did affect buildings.[3] Most of them were located on the island of Euboea and the southern Peloponnese.[4] On 23 July, over 15 hectares of land were destroyed in a landfill site in Bodrum, southwestern Turkey. Over 200 volunteers and 100 firefighters tried to contain the fires across Turkey, which saw temperatures of 48\u00a0\u00b0C (118\u00a0\u00b0F) on 25\u201326 July.[5]"

        "content": "In the Mediterranean region, the current fire frequency due to human activity is considered much larger than the natural rate.[6] 95% of forest fires in Spain are human-induced.[7][8] The 2009 Mediterranean wildfires occurred during a particularly hot and dry summer period, increasing the risk of wildfires burning out of control once ignited.[2] Temperatures peaked at 44\u00a0\u00b0C (111\u00a0\u00b0F) in mainland Spain and reached 37\u00a0\u00b0C (99\u00a0\u00b0F) in Gran Canaria.[3] These conditions, combined with insufficient fire-fighting resources and an inadequate official response in some of the affected countries, exacerbated the extent of the damage. Uncontrolled legal and illegal scrub burning by farmers is a major cause of forest fires in the Mediterranean region.[9] Arson, while still a significant factor, has diminished in Spain and Greece in recent years. Decreasing property values generally and the introduction of legislation in Spain to tackle the issue has diminished the financial incentive to illegally clear forested land for development by burning.[10] Isolated cases of areas in Spain affected by fires caused by lightning strikes include Aragon (Spain), as reported by El Pais[1] and Moj\u00e1car, as suggested by the Spanish Forest Fire Organisation (INFOCA).[citation needed] The wildfires outside of Marseille, France, were reported as being caused by military training using tracer bullets.[1] The local government of Corsica believed the fires were caused by arson.[1]"

The second tropical cyclone of the season, Isa developed from a disturbance in the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands on April 12. It moved erratically at first, though after attaining tropical storm status it curved westward due to the subtropical ridge to its north. Isa very gradually intensified, and on April 20 the typhoon reached peak 1-min winds of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph), as reported by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center; Japan Meteorological Agency reported maximum 10-min winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph). After turning northward, it accelerated to the northeast, and merged with a larger extratropical cyclone on April 24. Early in its duration, Isa caused light rainfall and moderate winds on Pohnpei. Later, a stationary rainband from the typhoon dropped heavy precipitation on Guam during its dry season. Damage in the Guam National Weather Service area of responsibility totaled $1\u00a0million (1997\u00a0USD$, 1.9\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD), the majority of it from crop damage.

        "content": "In early April, the monsoon trough established itself across Micronesia near the equator. An area of convection within the trough developed in the Caroline Islands on April 9, and resembled the characteristics of a monsoon depression. Shortly thereafter, a large, yet weak low-level circulation formed within the system. The system drifted erratically for several days as it slowly organized; the system underwent several cycles of developing and losing convection. On April 11, the system maintained a persistent area of well-organized deep convection, and subsequent to an increase in upper-level outflow, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W at 1800\u00a0UTC on April 11. Strong influence from the monsoonal westerlies left the depression drifting and slowly executing a loop to the northwest. Based on sufficient satellite classifications, JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isa early on April 12 while it was located 105\u00a0km (65\u00a0mi) of Pohnpei.[1] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) simultaneously classified the system as a tropical depression and upgraded it to a tropical storm early on April 13.[2] With the subtropical ridge to its north,[3] Isa tracked to the north and gradually curved to the west. It slowly intensified, due to it being a large tropical cyclone, and late on April 13 JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status;[1] at the same time, JMA continued to assess Isa as a minimal tropical storm, and did not upgrade it to a typhoon until April 16.[2] Isa maintained a nearly due-westward movement, although tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a quick turn to the north. The JTWC recognized the northward model bias, which was described as under-analyzing the strength of the subtropical ridge. By April 16, the typhoon attained the equivalence of a Category\u00a03 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and despite a potential threat to Guam the typhoon remained 260\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi) south of the island. It gradually curved to the north, and on April 20 JTWC classified Super Typhoon Isa as reaching peak 1-min winds of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph). At this point, Isa became an annular typhoon, with a large eye and a lack of spiralform rainbands, while moving nearly due northward, through a weakness in the subtropical ridge.[1] Simultaneously, JMA assessed the typhoon as attaining peak 10-min winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph).[2] Shortly after peaking in intensity, Isa began to weaken, and by April 21 it dropped below \"super typhoon\" status. It accelerated to the northeast under the flow of the mid-latitudes, and the typhoon weakened more rapidly;[1] JMA downgraded Isa to a tropical storm on April 22,[2] which was followed suit by the JTWC the next day as upper-level wind shear increased. At 0600\u00a0UTC on April 23, the JTWC issued the last advisory on the system,[1] and the next day JMA classified Isa dissipated as it became absorbed by a cloud band from a large extratropical cyclone to the east of Japan.[1][2]"

        "content": "Isa first affected Pohnpei as a tropical storm on April 12. While passing near the island, the storm produced moderate winds across the island, peaking at 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). The winds downed several trees and tree limbs which destroyed 40% of the island's power lines. A few buildings reported roof damage. About 15% of the crops on Pohnpei were damaged, including losses to the banana and breadfruit crops.[4] After the passage of the typhoon, President of the Federated States of Micronesia Jacob Nena declared Pohnpei as a major disaster area due to the damage from Typhoon Isa and subsequent flooding; on April 20 heavy rainfall caused widespread mudslides and 19\u00a0fatalities on the island, though they were not related to Isa.[4][5] In Guam, the threat of Typhoon Isa postponed a flight from Guam to Honolulu, Hawaii for 48\u00a0hours. The flight was the last in Operation Pacific Haven\u00a0[de], which was a multimillion-dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6,600\u00a0Kurds in a political asylum to the mainland of the United States.[6][7] The threat of the typhoon also canceled the first round of the Omega Tour golf event, which was the second professional golf tournament in the island's history.[8][9] Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam, one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island, which dropped heavy rainfall of 15\u201325\u00a0cm (6\u201310\u00a0in) across the island. The rainfall was welcome as it occurred during the dry season,[1] and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45% above normal from the period between January through April.[10] The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) at the island's Naval Air Station; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island. The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings, particularly on the south side of the island. The combination of winds and sea salt caused damage to the island's tomato, okra, cucumber, and soybean crops.[4] Typhoon Isa later dropped light rainfall on the island of Rota.[10] Across its path, damage from the storm totaled over $1\u00a0million (1997\u00a0USD, $1.9\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).

        "content": "Following the formation of Typhoon Yancy, there was a pronounced surge of southwesterly flow in the Western Pacific monsoon trough west of Guam. Thunderstorm activity began to persist east of Yancy, but further development was slow to occur because of strong vertical wind shear. Early on August\u00a015, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started watching a persistent area of disturbed weather west of Guam.[1] Initially, the disturbance tracked west-northwest[2] and then eastward, but further development was inhibited by strong vertical wind shear.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression. Banding quickly wrapped around the center around a low-level circulation[3][nb 3] as the disturbance passed through the Mariana Islands.[2] By the evening of August\u00a016, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and the following morning, upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[1][nb 4] The depression turned west-northwest in response to a shortwave trough that tracked north of the system.[1] At noon on August\u00a017, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm,[3] although the JTWC did not follow suit until early on August\u00a018,[6] when ship reports indicated a tighter pressure gradient and winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[1] Tropical Storm Zola continued northwest and tracked through region of divergence aloft, which aided intensification.[1] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018, the JMA upgraded Zola into a severe tropical storm.[7] Further intensification was initially halted because the storm remained embedded in the monsoon trough, but on August\u00a019, Zola began to detach from the monsoonal trough, coinciding with an expansion of the storm's equatorial outflow channel. The cyclone subsequently resumed intensification while turning northwest in response to a subtropical ridge between China and Japan. Following the appearance of a ragged 45\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) eye on weather satellite imagery and a Dvorak classification of T4.0/120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph),[1] Zola was classified as a typhoon at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020 by the JTWC.[6] The JMA followed suit later that same morning.[3] Further intensification was aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough that provided an excellent poleward outflow channel. Based an increase in the storm's organization, the JTWC raised the intensity of the storm to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021, its peak intensity.[1] Around this time, the JMA estimated that Zola peaked in intensity, with winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg).[7] Increased southwesterly wind shear took toll on the typhoon,[1] and the storm weakened slightly prior as it passed between Kyushu and Shikoku,[2] with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of 175 and 130\u00a0km/h (110 and 80\u00a0mph) respectively at the time of landfall[7] on western Honshu.[2] After recurving to the northeast over the Sea of Japan,[1] Zola weakened to a tropical storm on August 22[7] and transitioned into a mid-latitude cyclone while interacting with the westerlies early on August\u00a023.[1] Both agencies ceased tracking the system at this time.[7]"

The initial fire area had not burned since 1871, and therefore the burn was seen as natural and beneficial.[4] The fire was monitored by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge, and was allowed to grow unchecked to over 4,000 acres (16\u00a0km2; 6.3\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)."

More resources were ordered to protect these areas.[5] By June 11, over 400 persons were fighting the fire, and hotshot crews and bulldozers were utilized to create fire breaks.[6] Air tankers and helicopters were also used to dump water and fire retardant near homes threatened by the fire. A temporary \"tent city\" was established at Skyview High School to house firefighters and support staff, and a no fly zone was established around the fire area. Smoke from the fire and others blazing simultaneously in Interior Alaska contributed to a visible haze of smoke over Anchorage and much of south-central Alaska. Fire managers began to take crews off the fire and reassign them after light but sustained rain fell on the fire for several days starting on July 18.[7] By July 21, the fire had stopped expanding, and around 200\u00a0staff remained at the fire to monitor and conduct mop-up operations of remaining hot spots near populated areas."

The fire burned 341,471 acres (138,188 hectares) between early April and late June in the southern Sangre de Cristo Mountains, in San Miguel, Mora, and Taos counties. It was the most significant fire of the record-breaking 2022 New Mexico wildfire season, as well as the largest wildfire of the year in the contiguous United States.[2] The fire destroyed at least 903 structures, including several hundred homes, and damaged 85 more.[3][4] The Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire formed from the merger of two separate wildfires: the Hermits Peak Fire began on April 6 when the U.S. Forest Service lost control of a prescribed burn, and the Calf Canyon Fire began on April 9 when an improperly extinguished Forest Service pile burn from January rekindled. The two fires burned into each other during a major wind event on April 22, 2022. Afterwards, the combined blaze was managed as a single incident, growing to surpass the 2012 Whitewater-Baldy Complex fire to become New Mexico's largest ever before it was fully contained on August 21.[5][6]"

Controlled or prescribed burns date back to indigenous land practices in the United States and are commonly conducted; they play a beneficial role in helping thin out fuels to prevent more severe wildfires, as well as in balancing ecosystems that depend on the introduction of fire.[9][10][11][12] However, seasonal winds in the afternoon of April 6 caused spot fires to ignite outside the project boundary, and the prescribed burn was declared a wildfire.[13] It was officially named the Hermits Peak Fire, after a nearby mountain of the Sangre de Cristo range called Hermit Peak. Crews worked to contain the incident, and by April 19, the Hermits Peak Fire had burned 7,573 acres and was 91% contained.[14] On April 9, a new fire ignited several miles to the west of the Hermits Peak Fire, also within the Santa Fe National Forest. It was officially named the Calf Canyon Fire, after the nearby Calf Canyon Road. This fire was caused by leftover burn piles from a prescribed fire from January 2022.[15] The fire grew to 123 acres by April 21, and that evening made a run to the north, growing significantly.[16]"

A red flag warning was issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) extending from 9:00 AM to midnight local time, including winds from 60 to 74 miles per hour and temperatures in the upper 70s. The two fires grew rapidly to the northeast, exhibiting extreme fire behavior such as crowning and long-range spotting, and many structures were lost.

Several days later, an 'unprecedented' period of severe fire weather began on May 7 and continued for nearly a week, fueling rapid growth of the fire, particularly on the northern flank. The fire often produced pyrocumulus and occasionally pyrocumulonimbus clouds, reaching tens of thousands of feet into the air.[2] The smoke columns were highly visible for long distances, including in Santa Fe, Taos, Moriarty, and Albuquerque, New Mexico. On May 16, due to the size and complexity of the incident, management of the suppression effort was reorganized. The fire was split into a north zone and a south zone: a Type 1 incident management team (IMT) managed the north zone, and a Type 3 IMT managed the south zone.[19][20] Personnel from across the U.S. contributed to the suppression effort. At one point, on May 27, there were over 3,000 personnel on the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire.[21] On August 21, it was declared the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire was 100% contained.[22] The final footprint of the wildfire spanned approximately 45 miles north to south, and around 20 miles from west to east."

However, hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed. The Southwest Coordination Center says 899 structures were destroyed in the fire, and a further 84 damaged. Governor of New Mexico Michelle Lujan Grisham said on May 17 that although she lacked hard figures, the number of homes/structures destroyed could be between 1,000 and 1,500.[27] After the two fires merged during the April 22 catastrophic wind event, 277 structures were reported destroyed, including 166 homes.[4] A breakdown of the buildings burned after that point is not yet available.

These included Mesilla Valley State Park, Coyote Creek State Park, Morphy Lake State Park, Storrie Lake State Park, and Pecos Canyon State Park.[30] On May 19, officials closed three of New Mexico's five national forests\u2014Santa Fe National Forest, Carson National Forest, and the Cibola National Forest\u2014as a result of the already-burning fires and the potential for future ignitions during the ongoing extreme fire danger. The forests were set to reopen July 18, 2022, closer to the arrival of monsoon moisture, although the closures could be rescinded earlier, according to the USFS.[31] On May 23, the USFS announced that effective 8 a.m. on May 25, the Lincoln National Forest was also closed until at latest July 30.[32]"

Ash that enters the water system could make the water untreatable, forcing the town to rely on water supplies temporarily diverted and stored in reservoirs.[33][34] At one point the town had less than 20 days of clean water left, and despite proposed stopgap solutions the only long-term fix proposed is replacing the town's entire water filtration system, at a potential cost of $100 million.[35]"

A U.S. Forest Service official apologized on behalf of the agency for causing the wildfire on April 11, at which point the Hermits Peak Fire was less than 1,300 acres and had destroyed no structures.[38] During a May 3 news briefing on the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire, Governor of New Mexico Michelle Lujan Grisham said the federal government needed to be held accountable for the wildfire, saying \"We should expect restitution and direct investment from the feds.\"[39] Grisham also signaled a desire for broader policy changes surrounding prescribed burns, declaring in the same May 3 news briefing that \"New Mexico is going to work diligently to make sure the feds have a whole new set of rules that keep us safer.\"[40] The discussion came as the Biden administration laid out plans to increase controlled burns, among forest thinning and other tactics, as part of a 50-billion-dollar program to lessen wildfire danger.[41] Governor Grisham also referenced the 2000 Cerro Grande Fire, which was likewise the result of an escaped prescribed burn conducted by federal personnel and also destroyed hundreds of structures.[42] Member of Congress Theresa Leger Fernandez, the representative for New Mexico's 3rd congressional district, sent a letter to United States Forest Service Chief Randy Moore in the first week of May, saying she was \"shocked that the Forest Service would perform a prescribed burn during these conditions.\"[43] The letter called for an internal investigation of the Las Dispensas prescribed burn, a review of the Service's protocols for prescribed burns, and an admission of responsibility for the Hermits Peak Fire. The USFS defended the decision to begin the prescribed burn and the practice of prescribed burning in general, and said it was conducting a review of the Las Dispensas prescribed burn.[44]"

One state senator suggested suing the federal government in order to get financial aid for the recovery effort, saying that the state should \"tell the government this is the way the cow is going to eat the cabbage today, and if you don't like it, we'll see you in court.\"[51] On September 30, 2022, the Hermits Peak Fire Assistance Act (\u201cHPFAA\u201d) was signed into law by President Biden.  The lawsuit was dropped,[52] but relief efforts by FEMA were inadequate due to policies and procedures more appropriate to flood and hurricane disasters than to fires.[53] Despite being made aware of these problems since a G.A.O. report in 2019,[54] FEMA had not implemented the necessary changes.[53] In December 2023 a new lawsuit was initiated because of FEMA's failures.[55][56]"

During McBride's three months with the club, he did not disappoint Moyes, scoring four goals in eight games, including his first game with the club, a 4\u20133 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He made close friends during the short time with players such as Leon Osman (with whom he still plays soccer) and Richard Wright.[16]\nEverton, unlike Preston, merely sought to extend McBride's loan period, but MLS rejected it, preferring a transfer over an extended loan for McBride.[17]"

It killed 117 people, injured over twice as many, and left hundreds homeless. The worst devastation occurred in the city of New Richmond, which took a direct hit from the storm. Over half of the town was left in ruins due to the tornado, which also caused minor damage to surrounding communities. The damage was reported to be over $300,000 (USD) ($10,987,000 in 2023).[2][3][1] As of 2019, it is ranked as the ninth deadliest tornado in United States history,[4] as well as the deadliest ever recorded in Wisconsin.[5]"

        "content": "June 12, 1899 was the day of the Gollmar Brothers Circus, which drew hundreds of visitors to New Richmond, Wisconsin. The town had 1,600 regular inhabitants besides the visitors. At around 3:00 pm, clouds began to build, and the sky became dark. As the circus ended for the day at around 4:30 pm, a heavy rain with some hail began to fall. The rain let up at around 5:00 pm and people began to head home for the day. By 6:00 pm, the streets of New Richmond were full of tourists, travelers, and residents.[6] At around 5:30 pm, the tornado was reported to have first touched down about five miles south of Hudson, on the eastern bank of Lake St. Croix. The tornado was described as a boiling cloud, and was reported to have skirted the hills to the east of Lake St. Croix before moving off to the northeast. Passing clear of Hudson and following both the Willow River and the Omaha Railroad, the tornado destroyed away several farms near the rural communities of Burkhardt and Boardman as it traveled on its northeast course. At Boardman, there were four deaths reported. The first reported casualty was Kate Heffron, a 55 years old woman that lost her life when the tornado destroyed her home and farm. The home and farm of 70-year-old Louisa Hurd also sustained a direct hit; Ms. Hurd and 13-year-old Gertie Wears were both killed as the home was swept away. Wears had stopped in along with her father and brother to visit, both of whom managed to reach the cellar before the storm hit. John Neitge, a young farmer from Deer Park who had been driving through with his intended bride, had also stopped at the Hurd farm to seek shelter from the storm. He was struck and killed by flying debris, while his bride was uninjured.[2][6] There was little warning in New Richmond before the tornado struck. The tornado was illuminated by lightning, but it was visible for only a few minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. As the tornado approached it became more visible, and a panic ensued with people scrambling to take shelter. Shortly after 6:00 pm, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of town, a wealthy and influential area. \nMany of the large homes were quickly swept away and destroyed in the tornado. [citation needed] The greatest destruction caused was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch lined with stores, offices, and tenements built of brick and stone. A large amount of fatalities occurred in this area, as many people had taken shelter in the masonry structures, but were killed by cascades of heavy debris as the buildings were destroyed. The city bank was also destroyed,[7] along with the town's Methodist Church. The tornado threw a 1.5-ton safe a full block away, and the only remnant of the church was the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet away.\nThe tornado also tore an iron-frame bridge from its supports and threw it onto an adjacent riverbank. It also destroyed the City Hall, in addition to the adjacent water tower, which caused a cascade of water to be released onto the streets below. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working-class residents lived. Almost every home in the area was destroyed, and the neighborhood was left with scattered debris and empty foundations. Substantial damage to large trees occurred too, some of which were observed later to be stripped clean of all bark and limbs. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was destroyed.[citation needed][peacock\u00a0prose] After leaving New Richmond, the tornado moved toward the northeast, continuing along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line. Most of its destruction after that point was confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of the town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, and passed barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. It came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, frightening residents who had experienced a similar tornado which had struck the town in September 1884.[8] A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson, was killed instantly when the tornado leveled his farmstead, leaving his wife and son seriously injured. Moving northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado swept through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away.[9] Several homes and farms in the vicinity of the hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away. The storm continued east into Barron County, and hit the farming community of Arland. Almost the entire settlement was demolished but no fatalities or serious injuries were reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.[10]"

        "content": "The storm had blown down telegraph lines in the immediate area, so two riders were sent to Roberts, ten miles to the south, to send messages into St. Paul with news of the tornado. Altogether, the tornado and the subsequent fires that burned throughout the following night destroyed the entire business district along with more than half the residences in the town, with total damage adding up to over 300 buildings. The only significant surviving structures were the Lumber and Roller Mills located on the banks of the Willow River, the latter of which was narrowly missed by the tornado, the town's public school, and the Catholic Church, which acted as either makeshift shelters or morgues. Only the extreme northwestern and southeastern portions of the city were spared. The town's electrical plant and water facilities were destroyed, so there was no way to counter the fires that burned through the scattered debris. Many bodies found in the aftermath the tornado were burnt beyond recognition\u2014it was impossible to tell if they died from the tornado or from being trapped and burned alive.[6][11] In the days following the tornado, the list of those killed in the tornado gradually grew, as several injured people died in various St. Paul hospitals. On June 22, 57-year-old Ward Gould died from complications caused by internal injuries sustained in the storm, officially bringing the death toll to 117: four at Boardman, two in Polk County, and the remaining 111 in the vicinity of New Richmond, including five victims who were never identified. 66 were residents of New Richmond, another 31 had resided in the adjacent townships of Richmond, Stanton and Erin Prairie, and the remainder were mostly from other communities nearby, such as Hudson, Stillwater, Star Prairie, Baldwin and Glenwood City.[12] Among the dead were 26 children under the age of 16, including a 10-year-old boy whose body was never found.[13] The town was damaged so severely that it essentially had to be rebuilt completely. Damage claims exceeded $300,000 ($7\u00a0million in 2006), however, damages may have been as high as $600,000 ($14\u00a0million in 2006).[6][14]"

At the time of its occurrence, it ranked as the third deadliest tornado in American history, outflanked only by the 1840 Great Natchez Tornado and the 1896 St. Louis-East St. Louis tornado. Since 1899, the record has only been surpassed six times, those being the Amite-Purvis Tornado in 1908, the Tri-State Tornado in 1925, the Tupelo and Gainesville tornadoes in 1936, the 1947 Woodward Tornado and most recently the 2011 Joplin Tornado.[citation needed] According to the research compiled by meteorologist and tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis, the New Richmond Tornado was the first determined F/EF5 in American history to cause a death toll exceeding 100, as the rating for the Natchez tornado has never been officially determined[16] (though is likely at least an F4 tornado), and the St. Louis\u2013East St. Louis tornado ranked only as an F4. In addition, the Amite-Purvis (1908 Dixie tornado outbreak), and Gainesville (1936 Tupelo\u2013Gainesville tornado outbreak), tornadoes have also both been classified as only F4 tornadoes.[17]"

Nepartak started to weaken on July 7 and then crossed Taiwan later, before emerging into the Taiwan Strait and weakening into a severe tropical storm on July 8.

        "content": "A low-pressure area developed  south of Guam on June 30.[7] During July 2, the Japan Meteorological Agency started to monitor a broad tropical depression that had developed about 780\u00a0km (485\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Yap State.[8][9] The depression was located within a favourable environment for further development with low vertical wind shear, while global computer models indicated that the system would slowly develop further as it interacted with an upper level low.[9] During that day as the depression intensified as it moved north-westwards in a weak steering environment, while deep atmospheric convection started to wrap into the system's consolidating low level circulation centre.[10][11] Early on July 3, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Depression 02W.[11] The system was subsequently named Nepartak by the JMA after it had intensified into a tropical storm, and an Ascat pass had shown that winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) existed within the storms eastern quadrant.[8][12] The naming of Nepartak brought to an end a record 199 day period without a tropical storm within the Western North Pacific basin.[13][14] After being named, Nerpartak started to accelerate north-westwards, as a subtropical ridge to the north of the system, became better established and acted as the dominant steering mechanism.[15] Over the next couple of days the system gradually intensified further as its upper level outflow improved, as a TUTT cell positioned to the north of Nepartak propagated westwards.[8][16] Thus, around 12:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm, and the system developed a large central dense overcast (CDO) with tightly curved convective banding.[8][17] Both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Nepartak to a typhoon early the next day, and afterwards the system underwent a period of rapid deepening.[18][19] The system entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility approximately at 06:00 UTC (14:00 PHT), upon which PAGASA assigned it the local name Butchoy.[20] Due to low vertical wind shear, excellent dual-outflow channels and very warm sea surface temperatures, above 30\u00b0C over the Philippine Sea, the compact and symmetric typhoon acquired annular characteristics and a well-defined eye on the evening on July 5. This prompted the JTWC to upgrade it to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon around 18:00 UTC.[21] On July 6, the JTWC estimated that Nepartak had become a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon.[22] Featuring a distinct eye, Nepartak reached its peak intensity at around 06:00 UTC, about 835\u00a0km (519\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Taitung, Taiwan. The JMA estimated the central pressure at 900 hPa (26.58 inHg) and ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 205 km/h (125 mph).[8] The JTWC estimated one-minute maximum sustained winds at 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph).[8] Maintaining peak intensity for a day, Nepartak started to slow down and weaken on July 7, owing to the topography of Taiwan inhibiting the inflow on the western side of the low-level circulation.[23] By 12:00 UTC, Nepartak's eye had become ragged and cloud-filled. Around that time, the typhoon passed close to a buoy near Orchid Island. The buoy observed a minimum pressure of roughly 897 hPa (26.49 inHg).[24] This observation was scrutinized by a National Taiwan University team,[25] and on September 13, the Institute of Oceanography of the National Taiwan University said that after calibrating the pressure sensor, they found that the lowest atmospheric pressure was in fact 911.5 hPa (26.91 inHg).[26] Nepartak made landfall over Taimali, Taitung County at 21:50 UTC (05:50 Taiwan Time on July 8) and subsequently emerged into the Taiwan Strait from Jiangjun, Tainan at 06:30 UTC (14:30 Taiwan Time) on July 8.[27][28] Weakening from a Category 4 super typhoon to a Category 1 equivalent-typhoon within 12 hours, as land interaction with Taiwan caused Nepartak's structure to degrade significantly, the mid-level circulation became decoupled from the LLCC.[29] Therefore, despite a favorable upper-level environment, the typhoon could not re-strengthen; Nepartak featured warming cloud tops, an expanding cloud field and deepest convection confined to the northwest and southeast peripheries of the LLCC.[30] Around 18:00 UTC, the JMA downgraded Nepartak to a severe tropical storm, and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm.[8][31] On July 9, immediately before the JMA further downgraded Nepartak to a tropical storm, the system made landfall over Shishi, Fujian at 05:45 UTC (13:45 CST).[8][32] This resulted in decaying convection and an elongating LLCC, therefore the JTWC issued its final warning.[33] In the afternoon, Nepartak continued moving inland as a tropical depression, and dissipated during July 10.[8]"

        "content": " Typhoon Skip, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yoning, was the final of three tropical cyclones in 1988 to directly impact the Philippines in a two-week time frame. Several areas of disturbed weather developed within the monsoon trough around November\u00a01. One area situated to the south of Guam gradually became better organized, and by late November\u00a03, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression, and a tropical storm later that day. Steady deepening ensued as Skip veered west and the cyclone was upgraded into a typhoon on November\u00a05. The next day, Skip attained its maximum intensity of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). Shortly after its peak, weakening ensued as the storm tracked across the Philippines. This trend continued once the cyclone entered the South China Sea, initially as a severe tropical storm late on November\u00a07. Slowing down in forward motion, Skip briefly turned west-northwest, then west and finally turned west-southwest before dissipating on November\u00a012. Typhoon Skip brought widespread impact to much of the already battered country. On Cebu island, almost 20,000\u00a0people were trapped in floodwaters. Along the slope of the Mayon Volcano, 2,600\u00a0people had to be evacuated due to a landslide. On the remote island of Palawan, 74\u00a0people were killed. Elsewhere, most towns in the Capiz province on Panay Island were flooded. Two people were killed and more than 700\u00a0people were evacuated from the Aklan province. In the Iloilo province, on the eastern portion of Panay Island, almost 40\u00a0villages were under water and nearby roads were impassable. Seventeen homes were demolished, and two people were confirmed to have been killed because of a landslide in Pasacao in the province of Camarines Sur. Throughout the city, ten people perished. Throughout the province, up to 27\u00a0people died and at least 20\u00a0others were hurt. In the suburbs of Manila, thirteen people drowned, all in three suburbs, but city proper itself avoided the worst impact from Skip. Overall, 237\u00a0people were killed as a result of the typhoon while 35\u00a0other people were injured. Throughout the country, damaged totaled $131.8\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD)."

        "content": "The first of two tropical cyclones to form in the basin during November\u00a01988, Typhoon Skip originated from the winter-time monsoon trough dominated by easterly trade winds, a common signal of a La Nina event. Several areas of low pressure developed along the axis of the monsoonal trough. On November\u00a01, an area of disturbed weather was noted near the Philippines; however, this would spawn Tropical Storm Tess instead. The next day, a second area of convection was noticed on weather satellite around 670\u00a0km (415\u00a0mi) southwest of Guam.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a03, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system.[2][nb 1] Several hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit. Satellite pictures at the time showed a well-defined center of circulation at the lower levels of the atmosphere and distinct curved banding features. Based on satellite images, intensity estimates of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph), the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 07:00\u00a0UTC. Four hours later, the TCFA was re-issued. That evening, following an increase in satellite intensity estimates,[1] both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm,[4][nb 2] the latter of which named it Skip.[1] Skip, while taking the course of a typical \"straight runner\",[1] the storm made its closest approach to Yap, passing around 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) to the south.[6] Tropical Storm Skip steadily intensified over a period of several days. Early November\u00a04, the JMA upgraded Skip into a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, the JTWC estimated that Skip attained typhoon intensity,[4] and the following morning, the JMA followed suit.[2] At noon on November\u00a05, the JTWC reported that Skip attained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), equivalent to a low-end Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).[4] The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started to follow the storm and assigned it with the local name Yoning.[7] Continuing westward,[1] the JTWC suggested that the typhoon attained winds equal to a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the SSHWS at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a06.[4] At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC increased the intensity of Skip to 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), just shy of super typhoon intensity.[1] Six hours later, the JMA reported that Skip reached its peak intensity, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[2] Early on November\u00a07, Skip made landfall over Samar in the eastern Philippines.[6] During the evening of November\u00a07, Skip emerged into the South China Sea[1] as a typhoon and severe tropical storm, according to both the JTWC and JMA respectively.[4] Following a decrease in forward speed, Skip moved west-northwest to the south of a subtropical ridge for the next four days.[1] By early November\u00a010, the JTWC assessed the intensity at 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) while the JMA reported winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). Rapid weakening then began; however,[4] and the JTWC downgraded Skip to a tropical storm later that day.[1] After Skip turned towards the southwest,[6] the JTWC stopped tracking the system early on November\u00a011.[1] After turning west on November\u00a011, and then finally moved to the northwest, Skip dissipated while the center was still offshore, about 220\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Danang on November\u00a012.[2] The remnants of Typhoon Skip continued the linger over the Gulf of Tonkin before fully dissipating.[1]"

There, seventy four people were killed[19][21] and ninety-five were initially listed missing.[17] In a small hamlet of Gilligan on the island of Palawan, the Philippine Red Cross reported that 900\u00a0people lost their lives; however, authorities insisted only eight people were killed[21] and that Tropical Storm Tess brought far worse impacts to the region.[22] Nearby, eight casualties occurred in Mindoro.[21] At least 10\u00a0small\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats went missing off Negros.[17] Moreover, 14 of the 16\u00a0towns in Capiz province\u2013located on Panay Island to the southeast of Manila\u2013were flooded,[12] resulting in hundreds of families being evacuated to schools and churches.[12] Greater than 700\u00a0people were evacuated from low-lying areas of the Aklan province,[14] where two people perished.[15] In the Iloilo province, on the eastern part of Panay Island, close to 40\u00a0villages were under water. Roads around the provincial capital, Iloilo City, were impassible and two major bridges were washed away.[17] Two major bridges were swept away by the typhoon. Throughout Panay Island, eight fatalities were reported, seven of which were drownings while another person was electrocuted by a downed power line.[23] Seventeen homes were demolished,[16] 23\u00a0people were buried,[12] and ten bodies were recovered[16] on a landslide in Pasacao in the province of Camarines Sur.[14] Throughout the city, ten people, six of whom were children, were killed.[14] Elsewhere in Camarines Sur, two children died in a tornado.[14] Province-wide, 19\u00a0to\u00a027 people perished[24] and at minimum 20 were wounded.[25] Unlike during Ruby, Manila avoided the inner core of Typhoon Skip,[14] though there were reports of waist-high water in some neighborhoods, forcing residents to use wooden planks and tires to navigate the floodwaters.[26] However, the suburb of Pasig, already inundated by Typhoon Ruby a couple weeks prior, faced additional flooding, resulting in the deaths of seven children.[15] Throughout the metro area, thirteen people drowned, all in three suburbs.[27] A freighter, the Sea Runner, sank in port on Bohol Island due to strong winds and heavy waves from Skip. All 17\u00a0crewmen escaped. However, the ship's cargo of 11,250\u00a0bags of cement was lost.[12] Nineteen crewmen fled in a life raft when the tanker Ethane ran aground off a small island 110\u00a0mi (175\u00a0km) south of Manila. A passenger ship, the Sampaguita, sunk just offshore Zamboanga City in the extreme southern portion of the country but all passengers and crew were reported safe. Two small ships, however, were rendered missing.[28] In all, the storm directly affected 3,027,601\u00a0people, or 318,968\u00a0families. Nationwide, 146\u00a0people were injured.[29] Infrastructure damage totaled $106.2\u00a0million (1988 USD), while damage to agriculture accumulated to $16.5\u00a0million and damage totaled $8.9\u00a0million in private properties. Overall, Skip was responsible for $131.8\u00a0million in damage.[30][nb 3] Additionally, 144,136\u00a0people or 28,824\u00a0families were evacuated to shelters as a result of the flooding. In all, 237\u00a0people were killed due to Typhoon Skip.[21][31] Since many roads in the devastated area were impassable, officials were forced to ferry relief goods to stranded residents by small boats and military helicopters.[32] The Canadian Red Cross donated CD$5,000, while the city of Ottawa donated CD$150,000.[33]"

Over 1,250 firefighters were deployed to the Okanogan Complex.[3] Three United States Forest Service firefighters were killed in an accident near Twisp on August 19.[4] Traditional methods of containing such wildfires, such as creating bulldozer lines, were not readily available due to the irregular terrain and because an inversion layer trapped smoke in the valley, making it difficult to fly in water by helicopter.[5] On August 24, some media outlets reported that it had become the largest wildfire in Washington state history, surpassing the Carlton Complex fire of 2014.[6] The Okanogan Complex fire did not merge into a single fire, and so the Carlton Complex remains the state's largest single fire.[7] By August 25 more help was arriving and no more structures had burned. However, nearly all the fires had continued \"to grow with little containment gained\" and higher winds were predicted by the end of the week that would feed the flames.[8] On August 25, 2015, there were 1,345 firefighters and 15 percent of the fire had been contained.[9] By September 19, the fire was 95% contained and management was turned over to local firefighters.[10]"

On July 1, several tornadoes touched down across western and northern Minnesota north of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minneapolis and St. Paul. On July 3, several tornadoes touched down from eastern New York to southern New Hampshire. No other fatalities were reported outside of Michigan. In total, 52 tornadoes touched from northeastern Kansas to New England during the three-day event."

For the next 6 to 8 hours, there were still thunderstorms rolling and rumbling through, and many people were afraid of further tornadic activity, especially since two-thirds of the City of Windsor were without power until the next morning. Many large trees were felled by the storm's winds as well."

The steel girder viaduct was built in 1944, and was just two lanes, going under the CN Rail line that leads to the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel. The storms associated with the tornado outbreak dumped such a large amount of rain and floodwaters, that the viaduct was flooded up to the height of a car's roof, as one automobile was submerged (The driver was unharmed, however). Since this viaduct was a well-known traffic bottleneck (even more so for transport trucks, since the viaduct was so low, it would peel the roof off their trailers), and would flood with around a foot of water from even a light rain, that it was completely closed, torn down, and rebuilt in August 1998, and finished 2 weeks ahead of schedule, and 2 million dollars under budget. The new underpass is built of concrete, is four lanes wide, and is designed to handle the largest of transport trucks."

A caravan was destroyed and a 2,000\u00a0kg (4,400\u00a0lb) tractor was lifted into the air, landing upside down. From damage analysis, the storm was stated to have \"incredible devastation\" as the damage that it caused correlates to that of an F5 rating.[4][5] The tornado was reported by witnesses as a swirling black cloud surrounded by flying debris, and producing a thunderous roaring sound.[4] The weather system that produced the tornado was a classic set-up for violent tornadoes of the United States.[4]"

But then another monsoon system was expected to lash the city which was to generate very heavy rains and the citizens  were still recovering from the last monsoon rains which broke the record of 1977 rain in Karachi, which was of 207 millimetres (8.1\u00a0in). However it only dumped 18 millimetres (0.71\u00a0in) rain and the system dissipated quickly on 26 July. Then on August 30 and 31 sudden heavy rains started to lash the city which dumped 147.7 millimetres (5.81\u00a0in) rain, Thus again Karachiites were forced to spend the night sleepless due to power breakdown and thousands were forced to end their fasting in traffic jams, as it was the holy month of Ramadan."

The conflagration, which originated 15 kilometres (9.3\u00a0mi) outside of town as a forest fire, was quickly pushed past fire barriers designed to protect the town by 100-kilometre-per-hour (60\u00a0mph) winds.

No casualties were reported amongst the town's population, but a pilot was killed when his helicopter crashed while he was battling the fires around the community. The fire destroyed roughly one-third of Slave Lake; 374 properties were destroyed and 52 damaged in the town, and another 59 were destroyed and 32 damaged in the surrounding Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No. 124, leaving 732 residents homeless.  The town hall was completely gutted by the fire, as was the library and radio station.  The hospital, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)  station and schools remained standing, however.  Insurable damage was estimated at CA$750 million, making it the second costliest insured disaster in the country's history at the time.  An RCMP investigation concluded that the cause of the fire was arson; however, no arrests were made.[3] The disaster prompted an outpouring of support from across the province, and across Canada.  The Canadian Red Cross and disaster relief agencies in Edmonton were inundated with donations\u2014enough that they asked people to no longer make donations directly at the evacuation centres. ATB Financial offered to defer mortgage and loan payments for affected residents, while a Calgary-based rental company offered rental suites in Edmonton to displaced residents free of charge for three months.

Approximately 8,000 such fires occur every year across the country, and collectively burn 2.5 million hectares of land.[4]  Such fires in Alberta usually occur in remote areas and rarely threaten populated settlements.  The last fire to seriously affect a community in Alberta destroyed 59 buildings in the hamlet of Chisholm in 2001.[5]  The Slave Lake area has been threatened by fires in the past.  Communities on the eastern outskirts of town were evacuated in 2001 by the approach of the Chisholm fire,[6] while the town was saved from destruction by change in the winds in 1968.[7] The province faced unusually dry conditions and high winds throughout the spring, leading to extreme risk of fire across much of the province.[8] By mid-May, over 100 wildfires were burning across the province, including 23 that were considered out of control.  Over 105,000 hectares (260,000 acres) had been burned, and the majority of the fires were in the Lesser Slave Lake area, where 15 fires were burning out of control.[9]  Nearly 1100 firefighters were battling the blazes across the country.[9]  As a consequence of the fire conditions, the provincial government enacted a complete fire ban across the entire province ahead of the Victoria Day long weekend; it was only the second time in history the government had issued such an order.[8] The fire that struck Slave Lake started 15 kilometres (9\u00a0mi) east of town around 1:30\u00a0pm on Saturday, May 14, and grew to 500 hectares (1,200 acres) within three hours.[10]  An evacuation order was issued for 250 people who lived in the area, while a second fire burning west of Slave Lake, near the hamlet of Wagner, prompted provincial officials to order the evacuation of 800\u2013900 people from that area.  Displaced residents were sent to Slave Lake, where the town's fire chief initially expressed confidence that the town itself was not in serious danger, though Slave Lake declared a local state of emergency on Saturday night.[11]"

Efforts to encourage residents to leave were slowed by power failures that knocked Lake FM off the air.[15] By 9:30\u00a0pm, the province declared a level four emergency\u2014the highest on its scale, and the first such declaration since 2005\u2014and a half an hour later, a mandatory evacuation was ordered for all residents of Slave Lake.[10] Over 7,000 people fled east and south to the neighbouring towns of Athabasca and Westlock, as well as the provincial capital of Edmonton, 250 kilometres (160\u00a0mi) south.[16]  It was said to be the largest such displacement in Alberta's history at the time.[17] By morning on May 17, officials announced that 95% of the town's residents had been evacuated and that RCMP officers were conducting searches for any residents who stayed behind.  Only essential staff and firefighters remained in the community.[14]  The RCMP dispatched personnel from neighbouring detachments to bolster Slave Lake's usual 20 officer contingent while additional firefighters were sent to Slave Lake from across the province to support the 120 already battling the blazes in the town.  Among the deployments were 100 firefighters, nine trucks and a heavy urban search and rescue team from Calgary.[18] Some residents questioned whether town officials acted fast enough to evacuate the town, noting that the order to leave was made after people had already begun to flee. Mayor Karina Pillay-Kinnee defended the actions of officials, noting that \"this is a first-time experience for us. I think it's an unusual situation.  We had fires on either end of the community.

The speed it was moving, the heat it was generating, the devastation, is second to none.\"  He praised the efforts of firefighters who chose to demolish some homes in advance of the fire, a decision he said saved many homes in the town.[21] In addition to hundreds of houses, the town hall, library, radio station and a mall were destroyed,[14] as were two churches.[22]  However the hospital, RCMP station and schools remained standing.[14] In total, the fire destroyed roughly one-third of Slave Lake; 374 properties were destroyed and 52 damaged in the town proper, and another 59 were destroyed and 32 damaged in the surrounding area.[23]  732 people were left homeless as a result.[24] Insurable damage caused by the fire was estimated at over CA$700 million.  It was the second costliest disaster in Canadian history, at the time, topped only by the North American ice storm of 1998 which caused $1.8 billion in damages, adjusted for inflation to 2011 dollars.[25] No casualties were reported amongst Slave Lake residents as a result of the fire, but a pilot was killed when his helicopter crashed while battling the blaze.[26] Jean-Luc Deba, an experienced pilot from Montreal, died in the crash at Canyon Creek, 24 kilometres (15\u00a0mi) west of Slave Lake.[27]"

Few residents took advantage of the opportunity, but those that did felt the tour offered a sense of closure.[31] Ten days after the town was evacuated, the first residents were allowed to return as part of a four-phase plan.  Approximately 100 workers in essential service areas, along with their families, were allowed to return on May 25.[32] Their return followed the restoration of critical infrastructure including power, water supply, telephone, police and fire services.[33]  It was expected the town's remaining residents would begin to return within days, and while some residents expressed no plans on returning to their former homes,[32] many looked forward to doing their part to help rebuild their community.[33] A local developer suggested it would be months before the community could even begin to rebuild homes lost in the fire,[34] Local home builders were expected to be overwhelmed by the task, while Slave Lake's remote location posed additional challenges to the rebuild process, including questions of where workers brought in to help rebuild the town would be housed.[35] By early July, drought conditions in northern Alberta changed to a series of floods that prompted further evacuations of at least 65 residents.[36][37][38] Later, a book, The Sky was on Fire: Slave Lake's Story of Disaster, Exodus and New Beginnings, written by Len and Nicola Ramsey, Joe McWilliams, and MJ Kristoff, was produced containing many of the victims and residents experiences of the fire.[39][40]"

After eliminating other causes, including lightning, the RCMP and the Alberta government declared that the fire was deliberately set.  Sustainable Resources Minister Frank Oberle stated, \u201cthe probable cause of the fire that burned more than 400 homes and other structures in Slave Lake was arson.\u201d[41] Though officials have determined the place and method of ignition, they did not name any suspects. With $700 million in damages caused by the fire, the case is the largest arson investigation in Canadian history in terms of dollar value.  The case is not being handled by the Slave Lake RCMP detachment; as 11 officers lost their homes, an outside investigative team was assigned for reasons of objectivity.[41]"

Half of that was provided as immediate relief for residents, including $9 million to pay for costs incurred during the evacuation. Another $15 million was set aside for residents without adequate insurance coverage or with limited financial capability, and would cover all housing costs for such people until August.[42] Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Premier Ed Stelmach toured the town via helicopter and met with front-line firefighters a week after the fire. Following the tour, Harper promised additional aid would be forthcoming from the federal government.[43] Albertans responded to the disaster with material and financial support. The Canadian Red Cross and disaster relief agencies in Edmonton were inundated with material donations\u2014enough that they asked people to no longer make material donations directly at the evacuation centres.[44] Communities across the province launched support drives to collect necessary supplies for evacuees.  Grade school students organized fundraising drives,[45] and community groups and businesses were overwhelmed by the public response.[46] Businesses across the province also stepped forward to help. Among them, ATB Financial offered to defer mortgage and loan payments for affected residents,[47] while a Calgary-based rental company offered 50 rental suites in Edmonton to displaced residents free of charge for three months.[48] Athabasca University made space available for limited school classes to resume for evacuated students,[49] Insurance companies quickly set up operations near evacuation centres to assist residents with any questions or concerns.[50] A benefit concert held in Edmonton and televised by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in mid June raised $150,000 for the Red Cross. Performers included Tom Jackson, George Canyon, and Johnny Reid.[51] A second benefit held over the Canada Day long weekend in Slave Lake itself hoped to raise an additional $100,000.[52] The three-day event, which averaged 3,000\u20135,000 fans per day, was headlined by Ashley MacIsaac, Dwight Yoakam, and The Stampeders and offered the community's residents an opportunity to relax in the midst of rebuilding efforts.[53] On July 6, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (Prince William and Catherine), visited the town to offer encouragement to residents and rebuilding efforts.[54] Slave Lake residents expressed gratitude towards those who offered support to the community,[55] even as it continued to struggle through the aftermath and rebuilding efforts weeks later.[56] On August 3, the Government of Alberta announced an additional $189 million in funding for rebuilding and disaster response in the Slave Lake area. The funding was allocated to: a regional wildfire recovery plan; a disaster recovery program for the town, the municipal district, the Hamlet of Red Earth Creek, the Gift Lake Metis Settlement, and numerous nearby First Nations reserves; and an interim housing project to accommodate 350 interim homes for displaced residents and families of the town and the municipal district.[57] On September 14, a second benefit concert, headlined by Paul Brandt and featuring High Valley, was held at the Winspear Centre in Edmonton.[58] Proceeds from the concert went to replacing the books at the Slave Lake Regional Library and a project in Haiti.[59][60][61][62]"

        "content": "The tornado outbreak sequence of March 1913[nb 1] was a devastating series of tornado outbreaks that affected the northern Great Plains, the Southern United States, and sections of the upper Midwest over a two-day-long period between March 21\u201323, 1913. Composed of two outbreaks, the sequence first began with a tornado outbreak that commenced in Mississippi early on March 21. Several significant tornadoes occurred, one of which killed seven people in one family and another destroyed much of Lower Peach Tree, Alabama, with 27 deaths all in that town. The tornado at Lower Peach Tree is estimated to have been equivalent to a violent F4 tornado on the Fujita scale, based upon damage accounts. The tornadoes occurred between 0630 and 1030 UTC, or pre-dawn local time, perhaps accounting for the high number of fatalities\u2014a common trend in tornadoes in the Dixie Alley.[2] In all, tornadoes in Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama killed 48 people, perhaps more, that day and injured at least 150 people. March 23, Easter Sunday, was the most violent tornado outbreak to affect the northern Great Plains on so early a date in the year\u2014a record that still stands as of 2020. That day, four F4 tornadoes affected portions of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, killing at least 168 people. The deadliest tornado of the day was a potent F4 tornado that grew to 0.25 miles (440\u00a0yd) in width as it passed through northern Omaha, Nebraska, killing at least 94 people in the city proper and three in rural areas. Damage in Omaha reached at least F4, possibly even F5, intensity, though confirmation of F5 damage could not be determined from available evidence. The tornado is the 13th deadliest ever to affect the United States and the deadliest to hit the U.S. state of Nebraska as of 2014. No other violent tornado would affect Omaha for another 62 years. Outside the Great Plains, the outbreak of March 23 also produced two other F4 tornadoes, one each in Missouri and Indiana, including a devastating path more than .5\u00a0mi (880\u00a0yd) through southern Terre Haute, Indiana, killing 21 people and injuring 250. In all, the two consecutive outbreaks killed at least 241 people and caused at least 19 tornadoes, though only significant events were recorded and other, weaker tornadoes may have gone undetected. The outbreak sequence also produced seven violent tornadoes, nearly half the documented total of tornadoes for the sequence. Tornadoes struck Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, and Indiana. At least $9.68 million (1913 USD) in damages were reported.[nb 2]"

        "content": "A series of potent storm systems traversed the US during March 1913,[3] described by the US Weather Bureau as \"...the most extraordinary situation in regards to the weather since the creation of the bureau.\"  Anomalously high moisture had gathered near the US Gulf Coast, as an intense upper level storm system moved in from the west. According to retrospective numerical modeling of this event,[4] a strong cap aloft was in place over the central Plains, as is common as the elevated mixed layer advects eastward from the Rockies. Observations taken at 13Z 23 March 1913 showed that surface low pressure was located in Colorado, and a warm front stretched due eastward from there into Illinois. Morning temperatures near this front were in the 30s. South of the front warmer and moister air was present, but dewpoints in the upper 50s were confined to southern Oklahoma and Arkansas, far away from where the tornadoes were to later occur in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. As the day progressed, the surface low ejected through Nebraska, with a dry line and trailing cold front. South winds blowing 40-50 knots at times brought the moister air rapidly northward. One of the worst dust storms on record occurred behind the dry line in western Kansas, but in the warm sector the day remained dry until mid afternoon when light showers began to form in central Nebraska. A cooperative observer in Osceola noted that the wind shifted from S to NW at 2230Z (4:30 PM local). Professors at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln noted that the relative humidity there jumped from 53% at 2150Z to 78% at 2230Z, indicating much higher dewpoints had rapidly arrived in Lincoln since the cold front was still to the west near Osceola. They also noted that the surface low passed just to the north of Omaha and was in western Iowa at 01Z 24 March 1913. With all of this observed information, it is likely that the quality moisture required to produce convection strong enough for tornadoes arrived just an hour or two before the strong forcing associated with the surface low pressure and attendant frontal systems. At the time of the tornadoes it is estimated that surface temperatures were in the upper 60s, dewpoints were in the upper 50s, and surface winds were southerly around 25-30 knots. Numerical modeling estimates that 500 hPa flow was around 80 knots from the WSW and that CAPE was from 1000 to 2000 J/kg. These conditions are similar to those found in other tornado outbreaks.[5]  Tornadic storms developed from 5:00-6:00 PM local time and while storm motions were to the NE, the prevalence of tornadic storms moved southward with the dryline/cold front intersection, lasting until 8:00 PM local in NW Missouri. A serial derecho then formed and moved across Iowa and Illinois through the nighttime hours, hitting Chicago in the early morning."

The storm's path was reported as being 1\u20444\u20131\u20442\u00a0mi (0.40\u20130.80\u00a0km) wide and contained multiple vortices.[6] The Omaha tornado followed the path of Little Papillion Creek as it entered the city. It moved through the west side of town alongside the Missouri Pacific Railroad, destroying the small workers cottages in the area. The tornado was so strong that steel train cars were later found pierced by pieces of shattered lumber from the demolished homes. By the time the tornado reached Dewey Avenue it was five blocks wide. When it reached Farnam Hill, the tornado followed a shallow valley through this upscale neighborhood. The large mansions of Farnam were no match for the winds, and many houses were torn to pieces, along with several in the Gold Coast Historic District including the Joslyn Castle, which sustained considerable damage. Buildings were found chopped in half, pipes and supports dangling into space, such as the Duchesne Academy which was nearly obliterated. At North 24th and Lake Streets in the Near North Side neighborhood a large African American crowd was enjoying an Easter Sunday performance when the tornado flattened the building and killed more than two dozen people. Other brick structures in this small commercial district took similar hits, and more people died here than in any other part of Omaha. A streetcar running down North 24th Street in North Omaha encountered the tornado near this area. Thanks to the quick action of operator Ord Hensley in ordering passengers to lie on the floor of the car, everyone survived. Later, photographers would spot the wrecked machine and would call it the \"Streetcar of Death\", imagining that no one on board could have survived given the immense damage. The F4 tornado skirted the downtown area and moved over the Missouri River into Iowa, causing further damage before dissipating. In all, 103 people died, 94 of which were in Omaha, and another 400 were injured. Reportedly, 2,000 homes in Omaha alone were destroyed, with $8 million total damage from the storm, $5.5 million of which was in Omaha (financial damage estimates vary; the NOAA reports more damage than this). In the aftermath of the tornado, a cold front moved into Omaha and caused further misery, as newly homeless residents struggled to escape the snowy weather.[7] Many homes throughout the northern side of the city were leveled, and some were swept away. Photographs at the time showed empty foundations, which possibly indicated F5 damage, but these may have been related to post-tornado clean-up.[citation needed]"

The building was used as an infirmary for the wounded and dying, with physicians and nurses coming from area hospitals. US Army troops from Fort Omaha set up headquarters in the building, as soldiers patrolled the area for looters and to offer assistance. Initially, James Dahlman, the longtime mayor of Omaha, refused assistance from any outside sources, including the federal government. However, he relented after seeing the extent of the damage throughout the city. The federal government poured in assistance soon after. The massive damage caused by the tornado inspired new engineering techniques aimed at creating a tornado-proof edifice. The first such building was the First National Bank of Omaha building, built in 1916 at 1603 Farnam Street. The 14-story building was built in a \"U\"-shape."

        "content": "  Typhoon Chanchu, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Caloy, was the most intense typhoon in the South China Sea in the month of May according to the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). The first named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Chanchu formed on May\u00a08 in the vicinity of the Federated States of Micronesia and progressed westward. It gradually intensified into a tropical storm and later severe tropical storm before moving through the Philippines. On May\u00a013, Chanchu entered the South China Sea and became a typhoon, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Warm waters and favorable outflow allowed the storm to quickly intensify to peak maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on May\u00a015. Around that time, the typhoon turned sharply to the north toward southeastern China. Chanchu weakened as it curved to the northeast, making landfall near Shantou, Guangdong on May\u00a017 as a severe tropical storm. The government of China considered Chanchu the earliest typhoon to make landfall in the province. On the next day, the storm emerged into the East China Sea, becoming extratropical on May\u00a019 before dissipating west of Kyushu. Early in its duration, Chanchu moved through the Philippines, causing power outages and landslides in several islands. Despite a general warning against small boats sailing, a ferry departed Masbate and capsized due to the storm, killing 28\u00a0people. Throughout the country, 41\u00a0people died, and damage reached \u20b1117.57\u00a0million (PHP, US$2.15\u00a0million).[nb 1] While in the South China Sea, Chanchu caught many Vietnamese fisherman off guard, causing 17\u00a0ships to sink and damaging several others. Chinese ships assisted in the search-and-rescue mission, ultimately rescuing 330\u00a0fishermen from 22\u00a0boats; however, 21\u00a0bodies were found, and the remaining 220\u00a0missing were presumed killed. In southern China, flooding and strong winds from Chanchu wrecked about 14,000\u00a0houses and damaged over 190,000\u00a0ha (470,000 acres) of crop fields. Damage was heaviest in Shantou where it moved ashore, with flooding covering roads and entering hundreds of homes. Damage in China totaled \u00a57\u00a0billion yuan (RMB, US$872\u00a0million), and there were 23\u00a0deaths. Rains from the typhoon killed two people in Taiwan after sweeping them up in a river, and crop damage there reached NT$158.88\u00a0million (NTD, US$5\u00a0million). Later, high waves killed one person in Okinawa and left another person missing, while rains extended into South Korea."

        "content": "An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted on May\u00a05 southeast of Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Initially it remained disorganized while tracking to the west, although a circulation became more distinct on May\u00a07, indicative of gradual organization.[1] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a08, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] declared that a tropical depression had developed about 175\u00a0km (109\u00a0mi) northeast of Palau.[2] Five hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and at 18:00\u00a0UTC they classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W. The system moved to the west-southwest, influenced by the subtropical ridge to the north. Early on May\u00a09, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, and at 12:00\u00a0UTC the JMA followed suit by upgrading the system to Tropical Storm Chanchu. Also on that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing warnings on the storm as Tropical Storm Caloy.[1] In its formative stages, Chanchu was located in an environment generally favorable for intensification. Its tracked shifted more to the west-northwest due to a building ridge to the south.[1][4] Late on May\u00a010, the JTWC upgraded Chanchu to typhoon status, estimating 1\u00a0minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph). By contrast, the JMA estimated it intensified only into a severe tropical storm with winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph).[2][5] Turning more to the west, Chanchu made landfall on Samar in the eastern Philippines on May\u00a011. Despite moving through the archipelago, Chanchu intensified slightly within the Sibuyan Sea, striking Mindoro on May\u00a012 with 1\u00a0minute winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph), according to the JTWC.[1][5] On May\u00a013, Chanchu emerged into the South China Sea, and later that day the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status.[2] Upon reaching the South China Sea, Chanchu encountered an area of warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear.[6] After an upper-level low to the east provided favorable outflow to the south and the east,[7] Chanchu rapidly intensified on May\u00a014. While the storm was active, the JTWC upgraded Chanchu to a super typhoon with peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph),[1] although the agency later downgraded the peak winds to 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). By contrast, the JMA estimated peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) at 00:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a015.[5] According to the Hong Kong Observatory, the 10\u00a0minute winds reached 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph),[5] which made Chanchu the strongest typhoon in the South China Sea in the month of May.[8] By the time Chanchu attained peak winds, an eastward-moving trough over China broke up the ridge to the north,[7] causing the typhoon to turn sharply to the north into a less favorable environment.[1] With decreased outflow and stronger wind shear, Chanchu began slowly weakening.[9] The eye initially remained small, but the outer eyewall deteriorated on May\u00a016 as the convection decreased in the northern periphery.[10] The trough that previously weakened the ridge steered Chanchu to the north-northeast and forced an extratropical transition.[11] Late on May\u00a017, the JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm.[2] Around that time, Chanchu made landfall near Shantou, Guangdong in southeastern China,[1] about 315\u00a0km (196\u00a0mi) east of Hong Kong;[12] the JTWC estimated landfall winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph),[1] while the JMA estimated them at 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph).[5] Early on May\u00a018, the JTWC discontinued advisories, although the JMA continued tracking Chanchu over southeastern China through eastern Fujian province. Later on May\u00a018, the storm emerged into the East China Sea, becoming fully extratropical at 00:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a019. The remnants continued toward Japan before dissipating at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day off the west coast of Kyushu in southern Japan.[1][2][5]"

Officials canceled several flights and ferry lines,[13] stranding 10,000\u00a0people.[14] In all, 2,144\u00a0people evacuated in the Philippines.[15] PAGASA issued a storm signal number 2 for several provinces along Chanchu's path, as well as storm signal number 1 for other areas, largely forecasting for rainfall and gusty winds.[16] Vietnamese fishermen in the South China Sea received 24\u00a0hours of warning from the National Hydrometerological Forecast Center before Chanchu approached the area, less time than other agencies in the region.[17] At one point, Chanchu was forecast to become a strong typhoon and make landfall near Hong Kong. In response to the threat, officials at the Hong Kong Observatory, as well as in Macau, issued a standby signal to inform the public of the approaching typhoon.[18] The HKO issued a warning signal number 3 on May\u00a017.[8] In the territory, 60\u00a0flights were canceled with another 14 delayed,[8] beaches were closed, and ferry service was disrupted.[19] Ahead of the storm, about 1\u00a0million people evacuated from coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces to government warehouses, schools, tents, or the houses of relatives.[20] In the former province, 62,000\u00a0fishermen were ordered to return to port, while four flights were canceled at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Residents were advised to remain indoors, and workers reinforced billboards in anticipation of the strong winds. Rail and boat transport was stopped between Guangdong and Hainan across the Qiongzhou Strait due to the typhoon.[19] Schools were closed in Guangdong during the storm's passage, although they remained open in Fujian.[21] In Shanghai, the speed limit of Donghai Bridge was halved because of strong winds.[22] Ahead of the storm, the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan issued land and sea warnings.[23] The Tainan City Government and three county governments closed for one day. All domestic flights to offshore islands were canceled, and rail service was interrupted.[24] Later, airlines canceled 12\u00a0flights in Japan due to the storm.[25]"

In Legazpi, Albay, strong waves wrecked 100\u00a0homes and left 1,500\u00a0people homeless.[13] High winds left widespread power outages, particularly in Mindoro, Batangas, and across the Bicol Region.[26] The storm severely damaged the banana industry and affected various other fruit crops.[27] Near Metro Manila, the winds damaged billboards, knocked over trees, and caused isolated power outages. Rough seas sank a ferry off Masbate, despite a warning against the operation of small craft, having left at sunrise to avoid the police. The Coast Guard rescued 18\u00a0passengers,[14] but 28\u00a0people died in the wreck.[26] An empty ferry sank at port in Tabaco. A ferry with 700\u00a0people aboard went missing, but the Coast Guard found it washed ashore with everyone safe on board. Similarly, an oil tanker washed ashore at Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, and its crew of 13 was rescued.[14] Throughout the country, Chanchu killed 41\u00a0people,[19] mostly from the Masbate ferry wreck.[26] The storm damaged 5,630\u00a0homes, and destroyed 1,013\u00a0others,[15] forcing 53,307\u00a0people to leave their homes.[26] Agricultural losses totaled \u20b171.57\u00a0million (PHP, US$1.3\u00a0million),[nb 4] chiefly to the corn harvest,[26] with an additional \u20b146\u00a0million (PHP, US$850,000)[nb 4] in infrastructure damage.[15] While stalled over the South China Sea, Chanchu's large circulation caused an increase in rainfall over Malaysia.[29] The typhoon brought the onset of the summer monsoon in the South China Sea after shifting the prevailing winds over the region.[30]"

The associated flooding washed away many shrimp from coastal ponds and also entered Thu B\u1ed3n River, thus preventing its use as a source for irrigation for about 1,000\u00a0ha (2,500 acres) of rice paddy fields.[20] Due to its unexpected change in course and ferocity, Chanchu caught dozens of ships off guard and damaged communications, sinking 17\u00a0ships and damaging several others.[31] Initially, there were 400\u00a0fishermen missing,[32] although there was conflicting information with regard to the number of ships and people affected,[31] particularly with ships near Hainan or Taiwan.[33] Following a request from the Vietnamese government, the Chinese government deployed rescue ships on May\u00a019, a day after the storm made its final landfall.[31] Offshore Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province, 94\u00a0fishermen sought refuge on a Chinese island,[34] and 22\u00a0boats were found on Pratas Island (Tungsha/Dongsha), Taiwan (ROC).[31] One Chinese ship rescued 97\u00a0fishermen, but also found 18\u00a0people killed.[32] Chinese ships ultimately rescued 330\u00a0fishermen from 22\u00a0boats and provided them with food and water; this was the country's largest oceanic rescue at the time. Two Vietnamese boats departed from Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i to assist crews on damaged boats attempting to return to port.[31] Medical teams greeted the ships returning to harbor, while an altar was set up for the deceased.[33] After two weeks, the government of Vietnam ended the search, with 21\u00a0bodies found, and the remaining 220\u00a0missing fishermen presumed killed.[17]"

Rainfall in the country spread across Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang,[35] and Chanchu became the earliest typhoon to affect Shanghai in 80\u00a0years.[34] Rainfall totaled over 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) in southeastern Guangdong and southwestern Fujian. In the former province, wind gusts peaked at 170\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) in Huilai.[35] Upon striking China, Chanchu produced deadly flooding and landslides along its path,[20] with flooding spreading as far northeast as Zhejiang province.[36] One landslide in Fujian killed eight people and wrecked two houses.[37] In Guangdong and Fujian, Chanchu wrecked 14,000\u00a0houses and damaged over 190,000 hectares (470,000 acres) of crop fields.[8] Damage was particularly heavy in Shantou, Guangdong, where Chanchu moved ashore.[34] There were about 200\u00a0flooded houses,[37] and many roads covered, after rivers flooded from the heavy rainfall. The storm also caused power outages in Shantou,[38] and damage there totaled \u00a52.56\u00a0billion yuan (RMB, US$320\u00a0million).[34] In nearby Xiamen, the typhoon forced 43\u00a0factories to temporarily close, resulting in a loss of \u00a562.2\u00a0million yuan (RMB, US$7.8\u00a0million).[nb 5][21] The storm killed eight people in Guangdong, five of them due to traffic accidents, and a further 15 in Fujian.[34] Overall damage was estimated at \u00a57\u00a0billion yuan (RMB, US$872\u00a0million),[nb 5] roughly evenly split between Guangdong and Fujian.[34] This was less than expected given the winds at landfall.[21] While passing east of Hong Kong, the outer rainbands of Chanchu dropped 43.5\u00a0mm (1.71\u00a0in) of rainfall at Sha Tin. Sustained winds in the territory reached 96\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph), while gusts reached 146\u00a0km/h (91\u00a0mph), both recorded at Tate's Cairn. Chanchu produced a storm surge of 0.77\u00a0m (2.5\u00a0ft), causing minor flooding, sinking a yacht, and injuring one person who was swept into the sea.

The agency helped coordinate search and rescue missions.[43] Several areas were declared a state of calamity, mostly on Mindoro, Samar, and Batangas.[44] The Tzu Chi Foundation visited islands in eastern Samar, providing money to the families whose houses were destroyed. Towns in the region also assisted by supplying thatch to rebuild homes.[27] In Oriental Mindoro, the Philippine Red Cross provided food and relief items to families in Calapan.[20] The Adventist Development and Relief Agency also provided building materials for 200\u00a0families in Mindoro.[45] Ultimately, the government provided storm victims with \u20b1415.1\u00a0million (PHP, US$7.6\u00a0million)[nb 4] worth of relief supplies.[26] Rainfall from the storm caused a red tide in Taal Lake, after dispersing a Ceratium bloom.[46] Immediate after Chanchu's China landfall, officials began distributing tents, quilts, water purification tablets, and disinfectant.[20] The government of Fujian set up a \u00a58.5\u00a0million yuan (RMB, $1.06\u00a0million) relief fund.[34] In the months after Chanchu, China suffered from several other damaging tropical cyclones, including Tropical Storm Bilis and Typhoon Saomai.[47] Damage from Chanchu forced the China National Offshore Oil Corporation to shut down for a time, which contributed to an annual decrease in its oil output.[48] The Chinese government recognized 50\u00a0people who assisted in the South China Sea search and rescue mission, and two vessels were declared \"hero ships\".[49] Vietnamese president Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ee9c L\u01b0\u01a1ng expressed his thanks to the Chinese government on May 22 for rescuing the Vietnamese on the imperiled ships.[50] Residents and industries in Vietnam raised \u20ab360\u00a0million (VND, US$36,000)[nb 6] for the families of the deceased fishermen, as well as providing 1\u00a0ton of rice. Trade unions encouraged workers to donate one day's salary to help storm victims.[52] The Vietnamese embassy in India raised about US$1,000[53] and Vietnamese people living in Greece raised \u20ab26\u00a0million (VND, \u20ac1,300 Euros) for storm victims.[54] Ultimately, 43 different organizations and people donated $29,000 (USD) to the Vietnam Red Cross.[55] The country's Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs presented an award to the Vietnam News Agency in June 2006 for its charitable donations, which included the distribution of \u20ab112\u00a0million (VND, US$11,200)[nb 6] to storm victims.[56] One fisherman claimed to survive for two weeks in the open seas before being rescued, although he later confessed that he was safely on another boat, and wanted his family to retain the disaster compensation; after the man revealed that he had lied, his family was able to retain the relief funds due to their poverty.[57] The head of the Vietnam Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Environment resigned two weeks after Chanchu killed many fishermen because of inadequate warnings. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng ordered a review of the meteorological agency as a result.[17] Within a few years after the typhoon, the meteorological agency began issuing more accurate and timely forecasts.[58] After the many deaths of fishermen from Chanchu, the Vietnam government prevented any fishermen from leaving harbor during the passage of Typhoon Durian in November.[59] After the season ended, members of the 39th meeting of the Typhoon Committee of the World Meteorological Organization met in Manila in December 2006. They discussed retiring the name \"Chanchu\", along with four other names from the season.[29] During the 40th meeting in November 2007, the Typhoon Committee approved the retirement, announcing that the name \"Sanba\" would replace Chanchu on the basin name lists beginning in 2008.[60]"

Tornadoes formed on that day across several Plains states including Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The Colorado storm system then moved toward the Central and Southern Plains on the next day and affected areas slightly to the east of the area affected on May 9. A new trough of low pressure developed in the vicinity of the southern storm. It later moved across the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles.[2][3] As happened on numerous other occasions, such storms produced a large moist and warm flow from the Gulf of Mexico as well as much instability in the atmosphere. Being in May, storm systems produced large contrasts of temperatures, which added more ingredients for the development of powerful thunderstorms with possible damaging tornadoes. Such was the case on May 10, 1905."

The dam was under the control of the Russian military, which had seized it in the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[7][8] Many experts have concluded that Russian forces likely blew up a segment of the dam to hinder the planned Ukrainian counter-offensive.[9][10] Russian authorities have denied the accusation. The dam was about 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) tall and 3.2\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) long;[11] the breached segment was about 85\u00a0m (279\u00a0ft) long.[12] Two days after the breach, the average level of flooding in the Kherson Oblast was 5.61\u00a0m (18.4\u00a0ft), according to local officials.[13][14] There were signs of an explosion at the time of the breach. Both Ukrainian and Russian sources reported hearing blasts from the dam's hydroelectric power station,[4][5] regional seismometers detected explosions in the area,[6][10] and a satellite detected the infrared heat signature of an explosion.[15] Water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir, controlled by Russia, had been rising for months and were at a 30-year high when the dam failed.[16] Thousands of residents downstream were evacuated, and floods submerged several villages in Ukrainian- and Russian-controlled areas. By 21\u00a0June, 58\u00a0people were reported to have been killed and 31 were missing.[2][3] Russian authorities officially report that 59 people drowned in total, but local health workers and a volunteer grave digger from Oleshky have told The Associated Press that the death toll was in the hundreds from that city alone, with shallow mass graves dug for the victims. According to the informants, reporting of deaths in Oleshky was hampered by interference from police beginning June 12, by relocation of bodies and by extortion of families of survivors and coercion of health care workers to misreport causes of death on death certificates, which could not be written in Ukrainian language in Russian-occupied territory or conveyed to Ukrainian authorities.[1] Flooding killed many animals and damaged farmland, homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The loss of water from the reservoir could threaten the long-term water supply to Russian-controlled Crimea and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, but there was no immediate risk to either."

        "content": "The Kakhovka Dam raised the natural level of the Dnieper River by 16\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft),[17] flooding the Great Meadow and creating the Kakhovka Reservoir. This was the second-largest reservoir in Ukraine by area (2,155\u00a0km2\u00a0[832\u00a0sq\u00a0mi]) and the largest by water volume (18.19\u00a0km3\u00a0[4.36\u00a0cu\u00a0mi]).[17][18] Another dam on the Dnieper was breached twice during World War II in Ukraine. In August\u00a01941, the Soviet NKVD blew up the Dnieper dam to hinder the Nazi German advance, killing between 3,000 and 100,000 Soviet civilians, as well as Soviet troops. In 1943, it was blown up again, this time by retreating German troops.[19][20][21] The Kakhovka dam was built in 1956 and was seized by Russian forces in February\u00a02022, during the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[22] Russia attacked Ukrainian infrastructure that year, damaging several other dams and leaving Ukrainians without access to water. Examples include rocket attack against Kyiv dam on 26\u00a0February 2022,[23] the destruction of the Oskil Dam by Russian land forces in July and the missile attack on the Kryvyi Rih dam that September.[24] According to Ukrainian military intelligence, Russian forces carried out \"major mining\" of the Kakhovka dam shortly after taking control in February\u00a02022, and in April\u00a02022 mined locks and supports and installed \"tented trucks with explosives [on] the dam itself\".[25] In October\u00a02022, the Foreign Minister of Moldova, Nicu Popescu, said that Ukraine had intercepted Russian missiles targeting a different dam, on the Dniester river.[26] At the time, Ukrainian president Zelenskyy warned of Russian preparations to destroy the Kakhovka dam and blame Ukraine, and called for an international observation mission at the dam to prevent a potential catastrophe.[27] On 19\u00a0October 2022, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that Russia was likely setting information conditions to conduct a false-flag attack on the Kakhovka Dam. The Russian military announced that they had received information that Ukraine intended to strike the dam. According to ISW analysis, they likely intended these warnings to set information conditions for Russian forces to damage the dam and then to blame Ukraine, while using the floods to cover their own retreat.[28] In late 2022, Ukraine retook the western bank of the Dnieper during the Kherson counteroffensive. Ukraine accused Russia of planning to breach the Kakhovka dam with explosives in retaliation.[29] During the counteroffensive, Ukrainian Major General Andriy Kovalchuk at one point considered flooding the Dnieper River below the dam, so Ukrainian forces conducted HIMARS test strikes on the Kakhovka dam. One strike targeted one of the dam's floodgates to determine if the rocket could open it. The test was deemed a success and the action was kept as a \"last resort\" in case of a Russian offensive.[30] When Russian forces retreated from Kherson in November 2022 they destroyed the bridge deck behind them, damaging some of the sluice gates[31] in a controlled demolition.[32] The Russians then opened more sluice gates, allowing water to rush out of the reservoir. Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration suggested that Russia intended to flood the area south of the dam, to keep Ukrainian forces from crossing the Dnieper River.[34] Ukrhydroenergo, Ukraine's hydro electric company, likewise believed Russian occupiers \"opened the station's locks fearing an advance of Ukrainian soldiers\".[34] Spring 2023 brought an unusually large amount of rain, with 3.5 times the normal amount of rainfall recorded in April.[35] On 3\u20136 May, satellite photos indicated that Russian forces were building a small dam on Tokmachka river, which resulted in significant widening and flooding upstream, at the direction of expected Ukrainian offensive.[36] This was considered by some to be part of a Russian trend to use deliberate flooding to thwart the Ukrainian counteroffensive.[37][38] From mid-February to late May\u00a02023, either deliberately or as a result of neglect, the damaged dam was not adjusted to match the increased water flow. As a result, water washed over the top of the dam and land upstream of the dam was flooded.[39][40][41] Water levels in the reservoir reached a 30-year high.[16] According to journalist Peter Beaumont, it is possible that Russia had deliberately allowed water levels to rise to an extraordinary level in order to make the collapse more impactful.[42] A small part of a wall separating the dam and the power plant collapsed on 23 April (44 days before the dam failed).[10][43][44] On 28 May an aerial photo was taken of a car that appeared to be loaded with explosives, in the form of large barrels and a land mine, parked on the top of the dam. According to a Ukrainian special forces communications official, the purpose of the car was both to stop any Ukrainian attack on the dam and to amplify the explosion that the Russians planned to originate in the machine room, which was located in a building to one side of the dam. Early drone footage suggests that the initial dam destruction occurred near the machine room.[10][45] On 30\u00a0May 2023, less than a week before the dam breach, the Russian government decreed that in occupied Ukraine, \"Until 1\u00a0January 2028, technical investigations shall not be carried out into accidents at hazardous production facilities and accidents at hydraulic structures that occurred as a result of military operations, sabotage and acts of terrorism.\" Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called this a \"smoking gun\", saying that it would take somebody with a \"very vivid imagination\" to believe that the passing of this legislation less than a week prior to the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, covering precisely the circumstances that would transpire, was just a coincidence.[46][47] On 2 June, a small part of the road over the dam collapsed, along with parts of the piers which supported them, according to satellite images obtained by BBC News.[33][48][49] According to NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel,[50] \"That indicates to me that there were structural issues at the facility before whatever happened today.\"[48][51] The Institute for the Study of War reported on June 6, the day the dam was destroyed, that \"Russian sources have expressed intense and explicit concern over the possibility that Ukraine has been preparing to cross the river and counterattack into east bank Kherson Oblast.\"[52]"

        "content": "Between 2:18 and 2:20\u00a0A.M. local time on 6\u00a0June 2023, Ukrainian and Russian sources reported loud sounds like explosions that appeared to come from the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant in the dam.[4][12] Nova Kakhovka residents discussed the explosions on a Telegram channel with 5,000\u00a0members, with one resident describing (in Ukrainian) \"orange flares\" and saying that the water was \"very noisy ... very loud\" at 2:45.[5] Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was an \"internal explosion\" at 2:50\u00a0[A.M.].[53] According to The Economist, the explosions were so strong that they rattled windows 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) from the dam.[54] Regional seismometers in Romania and Ukraine that were 600 and 500\u00a0km (370 and 310\u00a0mi) away detected signals that Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) scientists interpreted as a weak seismic event in the area of the dam at 2:35\u00a0A.M. Ukrainian summer time, and a stronger, possibly magnitude\u00a01 to 2 signal representing an explosion occurring at 2:54\u00a0A.M.[6][55][56] (seismic waves, which travel at 6\u00a0km/sec in surface rock, would take approximately 83 and 100 seconds to travel 500 and 600\u00a0km, respectively).[57] NORSAR department head Ben Dando said the characteristics of the 2:54 signal corresponded well to those of an explosion but he said there was \"too much uncertainty\" on the magnitude, meaning that the power was equally uncertain.[56] Officially collected data was not clear enough to establish whether there were one or two explosions, or even whether the signal of 2:35\u00a0a.m. represented an explosion.[56] NORSAR CEO Anne Lycke said it was clear that the signal heard at 2:54 represented a man-made event, but it remains uncertain whether that signal was what caused the dam to collapse.[12] An infrared heat signature, consistent with that of a major explosion, was detected at the dam by United States spy satellites shortly before it collapsed.[15] Experts consulted by The New York Times (NYT) said on 7 June that the most likely cause was a blast from inside, adding that an attack from outside or a structural failure were less plausible. They said that blasts from outside\u2014such as from a missile or artillery strike\u2014would exert only a fraction of the force needed, and would also have accuracy limitations.[9] Ihor Syrota, the director general of the Ukrainian hydroelectric power company Ukrhydroenergo, rejected the possibility of shelling or catastrophic structural failure as Russian propaganda. Syrota stated that \"the plant was designed to withstand a nuclear strike. To destroy the plant from the outside, at least three aircraft bombs, each of 500\u00a0kg, would have had to [have been] dropped on the same spot. The station was blown up from the inside\".[55] Christopher Binnie, a water engineer specializing in dams and water resources development,[58] and visiting professor at the University of Exeter, said the fact that there were \"two breaches, either side of a structure\", indicates that natural causes are highly unlikely. \"Were the breach to be caused by excess upstream water level there would only be one\". He also said it was highly unlikely the dam was breached by Ukrainian shelling, because to destroy the dam they \"would need to get massive explosives close to the foundations\".[12][59] The New York Times published another examination of the reason for the dam failure on 16\u00a0June.[10] They consulted with Ihor Strelets, an engineer who spent months at the dam and served as the deputy head of water resources for the Dnieper from 2005 until 2018, who said the dam's huge bulk was mostly hidden below the waterline. A colossal block of nearly-solid concrete, 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) high and up to 40\u00a0m (130\u00a0ft) thick at the bottom, held back the water. It also meant the Cold War-era dam could withstand almost any attack from outside. The sluice gates sat on top of this concrete, opening and shutting to adjust the water level in the reservoir. It became clear after the breach that not only the gates but also the concrete foundation had been destroyed. There had been earlier damage to the roadway over the dam and to some of the sluice gates (Ukrainian missiles had done some of this, as had retreating Russian troops). Also, a small part of a concrete wall separating the dam and the power plant collapsed on April\u00a023 (44\u00a0days before the dam failed), which was said by NYT experts to be possible evidence of erosion near the dam.[10] According to the dam experts consulted by the NYT, neither this earlier damage nor the pressure caused by the high water level would have been enough to cause the structural damage to the dam foundation that occurred. There was a passageway inside the foundation that, according to experts, would have been the ideal location to plant explosives having enough force to blow up such a structure, and evidence suggests this is where they were planted. In the view of Nick Glumac, an engineering professor and explosives expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,[60] The New York Times also consulted with Ben Dando, a seismologist at NORSAR,[61] who said the two seismic signals detected at 2:35\u00a0A.M. and 2:54\u00a0A.M. are consistent with an explosion deep inside the dam and having enough force to blow the huge structure apart; they are not consistent with a dam collapsing from natural causes. Engineers interviewed by The New York Times made the same inference from the infrared heat signal picked up by a US satellite.[10] Volker Oye,[62] another NORSAR seismologist, said, \"We see a pulse of energy which is focused, which is typical of an explosion\". He said that a blast of this kind in this area but not due to an explosion would be an unusual coincidence.[63] After the first blast, videos suggest that the water further tore apart the dam. According to engineers who study dam failures and were contacted by the New York Times, this kind of damage to such a huge concrete foundation would be very unlikely unless there was an explosion deep inside. The engineers said there would need to be an examination of the foundations to reach a final conclusion as to how the dam was destroyed.[10] According to analyses by Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), it is more likely that the dam collapsed as a result of structural issues caused by the negligence of the Russians who were in control. CIT states that the gates being open on one side of the dam in an abnormal mode for eight consecutive months caused erosion in the soil on which the basement of the dam stood, reduced its load-bearing capacity, and resulted in the stability of the walls being compromised. CIT states that under this scenario Russian authorities are solely to blame for the dam failure.[43][64][65][66] CIT criticized the NYT analysis of a concrete wall (separating the dam and the power plant) that collapsed on 23\u00a0April (44\u00a0days before the dam failed), saying that NYT experts attributed this to erosion due to water discharge near the dam, but provided no explanation as to why erosion in that location could not have led to erosion of the dam's body.[43] They also criticized the failure of the NYT experts to explain the gradual collapse of the road near the main generator hall in the days preceding the dam's disintegration.[43] CIT questioned how the 2:54 seismic event could be attributed to an explosion destroying the dam when local residents reported explosions at around 2:20 and the timestamp on video footage from Russian servicemen showed that the dam was already destroyed at 2:46.[65] CIT asserted that the NYT analysis did not address how the gates being only open on one side for eight consecutive months affected the integrity of the dam and the formation of hydraulic jumps, nor whether the velocity of the water flow exceeded the non-eroding velocity.[66] According to Mark Mulligan, professor of Physical Geography at King's College London,[67] \"Structural failure resulting from the impact of earlier damage associated with the war remains a possibility. ...The very high level of water in the reservoir coupled with previous damage, leading to uncontrolled flows of water through the dam could lead to catastrophic structural failure\".[33] According to Andrew Barr, an expert in the effects of blast damage on structures at the University of Sheffield,[68] the dam actually had three different components:[69] Very early video footage shows that the barrage was the first to go, most likely by explosives.[70] Barr believes that the damage to the barrage exceeds what could have been accomplished by guided munitions,[70] and that when the water level goes down explosive damage should be easy to recognize.[71] Barr believes that the HPP was the next to go, and that this could only have been achieved by an explosion below the turbine hall.[72] This explosion would have been separate from any explosion that destroyed the barrage.[73] Last to go was a portion of the earth-filled embankment, both above and below the dam, on the left side of the river (looking downstream).[74] \"Unlike the concrete barrage and power plant, the embankment is not designed to resist large flows of water, and does not experience them in normal operation. The sheer volume of water mobilised by the sudden appearance of the breach appears to have quickly scoured the soil away,\" he said.[75][76][77] Barr supplied before and after images showing where each of the destroyed dam components had been.[71][78]"

        "content": "According to the Euroactiv media network, \"most experts agree a Russian attack is the more likely\" explanation for the dam's destruction.[79] According to analyses by dam and engineering experts consulted by The New York Times, \"the evidence clearly suggests the dam was crippled by an explosion set off by the side that controls it: Russia.\"[10] A report issued by the international human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance (GRC) concluded that the destruction was caused by explosions set off by Russia.[10][80] The GRC report specifically said that it is \"highly likely\" that destruction was caused by Russia, using \"pre-emplaced explosives positioned at critical points within the dam's structure\", and that this was \"an 80% and above determination\".[80][81] The GRC report was issued by a \"Mobile Justice Team\". These teams were created to implement the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group for Ukraine, which was established and funded by the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on 25 May 2022, \"to provide strategic advice and operational assistance to Ukraine's Office of the Prosecutor General (OPG) in the investigation and prosecution of atrocity crimes in Ukraine\".[82][83] The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), in reference to the NYT report, concurred that \"the preponderance of available evidence, reasoning, and rhetoric suggests that Russian forces deliberately damaged the dam\".[84] According to the ISW, Russia had a \"greater and clearer interest in flooding the lower Dnipro\" as it would widen the Dnieper and hinder a Ukrainian crossing, at the cost of flooding some of its own positions.[52] Newsweek and Politico reported that Molfar, a Ukrainian, London-based OSINT group, published a report[85] giving its analysis of the causes and chronology of the dam collapse, and concluding that Russia destroyed the dam.[86][87] An analysis by the Conflict Intelligence Team concludes that the dam collapsed as a result of structural issues caused by Russian negligence, and therefore Russia is responsible.[43][64][65][66] Structural issues were considered a possibility by others as well.[33][50][59] Ukrainian authorities have agreed with international experts who say that that Russian forces destroyed the dam[88][89][b] by means of a blast from inside the engine room. In regards to motivation, Ukrainian officials said Russia destroyed the dam \"in a panic\" to slow down Ukraine's planned counteroffensive.[90][91] Ukraine specifically blamed Russia's 205th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade, based at Nova Kakhovka, for blowing up the dam.[92][93] Investigative journalists from the Slidstvo.Info agency[94] and from the Schemes project (an investigative news project run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Ukrainian Service)[95] reported that they received incriminating intercepted conversations involving individually identified members of the 205th brigade. The conversations begin at 2:20, right before the dam was destroyed, mention that they are preparing to do something \"all on command\" and state that there was an \"emergency event\". At the end they were told to pack up very quickly and leave.[96][97][98][99] The brigade's Telegram channel warned in October\u00a02022 that the dam was mined and would be blown up if Ukrainian forces attempted to cross the Dnieper, also giving advice for Russian troops to stay safe.[100] On 9 June, the Security Service of Ukraine released what they said was an intercepted call between two Russian officers admitting responsibility for the destruction. In the call, the alleged officers say that the explosion was supposed to \"scare\" people but \"(they did) more than what they planned for.\"[101] The European Parliament announced on 15\u00a0June 2023 that it had adopted a resolution that condemned in the strongest possible terms Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka dam on 6 June, saying that this constituted a war crime. The Parliament also called for Ukraine to join NATO.[102] According to The New York Times, \"a senior American military official\" reported that the U.S. government \"had ruled out an external attack on the dam, like a missile, bomb or some other projectile, and now assesses that the explosion came from one or more charges set inside it, most likely by Russian operatives.\"[10] Russian government figures initially said the dam was undamaged, but later denied responsibility and blamed Ukraine.[103][104]"

A state of emergency on the left bank of the river was declared by Russian authorities.[121][122] On the morning of 6\u00a0June, Andrey Alekseyenko, acting head of the Russian-installed Kherson military-civilian administration, reported on Telegram that fourteen localities were on the area on risk of flooding on the Russian-controlled bank of the river: Bilohrudove, Dnipriany, Hola Prystan, Kardashynka\u00a0[uk], Kokhany\u00a0[uk], Korsunka\u00a0[uk], Kozachi Laheri, Krynky\u00a0[uk], Mala Kardashynka\u00a0[uk], Oleshky, Pishchanivka, Solontsi, Stara Zburyivka\u00a0[uk] and Zabaryne\u00a0[uk], as well as the islands of the lower Dnieper.[123] Ukrainian authorities said an evacuation of 17,000\u00a0people was underway from the territories under Ukrainian control, with 24\u00a0villages flooded.[124] The Ukrainian Environment Ministry reported on 25 June that the Dnipro had returned to its normal banks.[125]"

In the immediate aftermath, Russian news agency TASS falsely[127] claimed the zoo did not even exist[128] before backtracking and admitting that there was a zoo but insisted all animals were safe.[129] A video showing locals having to move cattle and pets through floods was widely distributed on social media.[122][130][131][132] The Red Cross warned that minefields were washed away. Erik Tollefsen, head of Red Cross's weapons section, said: Former minister of ecology Ostap Semerak said that this was the biggest environmental catastrophe in Ukraine since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.[134] The Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group issued a report that detailed the environmental devastation.[13][17] Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said on 20\u00a0June, \"More than 50,000 hectares (120,000 acres) of Ukrainian forests have been flooded and at least half of them (trees) will die. This is more than the area of forests in Iceland.\" He also said that the Kakhovka Reservoir was covered with 95,000\u00a0tons of dead fish.[135] The Grand Meadow National Nature Park, a protected area consisting of 13\u00a0islands in the northeastern part of the Kakhovka Reservoir was completely drained, raising fears of a drought, while water levels decreased by approximately 13 meters in the Kamianska Sich National Nature Park, according to the Ukrainian Environment Ministry.[125] The Governor of Kherson Oblast, Oleksandr Prokudin, also said that the Askania-Nova biosphere reserve downstream from the dam was also devastated by the inundation caused by the latter's collapse.[136] The release of chemicals such as ammonia and bacteria such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae into the Dnipro-Buh Delta and the Black Sea following the dam's destruction led to beach closures and fishing bans across Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts. Authorities said the contamination of those areas had turned them into \"garbage dumps\" and \"animal cemeteries.\"[137] In the weeks following the dam's destruction, Ukraine claimed that outbreaks of intestinal diseases such as cholera had broken out in Russian-occupied areas of Kherson Oblast and Crimea, adding that several Russian soldiers had died as a result.[138][139] According to ecologist Alexey Vasilyuk, for decades industrial waste from Zaporizhzhia, including a huge amount of heavy metals, settled in the mud at the bottom of the Kakhovka Reservoir since there was no flow to disturb it. Now, the current in the river raises this waste into the water column and moves it downstream. Also, the area that used to be at the bottom of the reservoir but has now dried out will begin to be blown away by the wind, allowing these metals to be absorbed into plants that people and animals eat. Vaslyuk advises that the sowing of grasses in these bare areas will help prevent dispersion of these metals.[140] The year after the dam's destruction, wildlife returned to the Great Meadow, area that had been under the reservoir. Fish that had been locally extirpated by the dam, such as sturgeon and herring, returned, and willow and poplar trees have sprouted and grown.[141]"

The increased difficulty of moving forces in the area would help secure the Russian southern flank, freeing up military resources to repel Ukraine's offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.[42][149][150] Furthermore, the civil emergency could be expected to drain resources that could otherwise have been used by Ukraine in the war.[151] Five days after the breach, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar said on 11 June that Russian forces were transferring their most combat-capable forces from Kherson to Bakhmut, adding that Russia likely destroyed the dam to shorten its defensive lines in Kherson ahead of the Ukrainian counteroffensive.[152][153] But four days later, the Institute for the Study of War said that they had not yet observed Russian elements moving from Kherson to Bakhmut.[154] The UK Defense Ministry said on 19\u00a0June that over the previous 10 days Russia had moved elements of its Dnipro Group of Forces from the eastern bank of the Dnieper River to reinforce the Zaporizhzhia and Bakhmut sectors, and that this likely reflects Russia's perception that a major Ukrainian attack across the Dnieper had become less likely.[155][156] Retired U.S. general David Petraeus said on June\u00a06 that the breach would cause no \"military implications that are particularly large\" because \"the period of time that this is under water restricts the trafficability and so forth, but over time that will clear up.\"[157] Petraeus said that as the flood waters recede, the river will actually become shallower and easier to cross.[158][c]\nHe also said that this event will not prove to be a decisive hindrance to Ukraine. \"I think they are going to crack the Russians. I think the Russians will prove to be quite brittle.\"[157] Before the breach, the Kakhovka Reservoir was 5\u201320\u00a0km (3.1\u201312.4\u00a0mi) wide, and quite difficult for an army to cross. As of 20\u00a0June, satellite images show that it has reverted to a river 500\u20131,000\u00a0m (1,600\u20133,300\u00a0ft) wide with the flood plain on either side rapidly drying out.[159][160] In some places it seems that it could be possible to cross the Dnieper River in a 4WD.[161] It has been asserted that the Ukrainian military could take advantage of this, and of the fact that the Russians have moved troops from that area to buttress their forces in Zaporizhzhia and the Donbas, to cross the Dnieper by assault.[161] In addition, the Ukrainians control the dams and reservoirs on the Dnieper upstream from Kakhovka, and could choose to hold more water there to dry up the river downstream and make it easier to cross.[162] On 15 November, Russia conceded that Ukrainian forces have been able to cross the Dnieper river, but claimed that they face \"fiery hell\", insisting that \"the Ukrainian assault would be thwarted.\"[163]"

As floods affected water pipes in Southern Ukraine, President Zelenskyy said that hundreds of thousands of people do not have \"normal access to drinking water\" in the region. Residents were urged to boil water for potential contamination.[164] The United Nations later estimated that about 700,000 people in the area were in need of clean drinking water,[165] while over a million people in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast alone were expected to face water shortages.[125] A minimum water level in the Kakhovka Reservoir of 12.7\u00a0m (42\u00a0ft) is needed to provide cooling water for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. However, there are several alternative sources adequate for essential cooling water while the reactors are in their current shutdown state. The International Atomic Energy Agency Director General said \"Our current assessment is that there is no immediate risk to the safety of the plant\".[166] The head of Ukraine's hydropower generating company Ukrhydroenergo announced that the water level had dropped below the \"dead\" point of 12.7\u00a0m (42\u00a0ft), meaning that water could no longer be withdrawn for settlements and for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. How low it could go would depend on whether the lower part of the dam had been destroyed to its base. If so, the water level would reach about 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) and the width of the reservoir would decrease from 3.5\u00a0km (2.2\u00a0mi) to 1\u20131.2\u00a0km (0.62\u20130.75\u00a0mi).[167] Initially, the water level was reported to fall 0.35\u00a0m (1\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) per hour. Twenty-four hours after the breach, the water level at Nikopol had fallen 2.5\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) and stood at 14.41\u00a0m (47.3\u00a0ft).[168] After 48 hours the level was 13.05\u00a0m (42.8\u00a0ft).[169] Ukrhydroenergo announced on 26 June that the Kakhovka Reservoir had become \"catastrophically\" shallow. The average level of the lower pool near the dam was 12.88\u00a0m (42.3\u00a0ft). On 25\u00a0June the average depth of the reservoir was 7\u20138\u00a0m (23\u201326\u00a0ft), and could go to 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft).[170] According to the Ukrainian Hydromedical Center the Dnipro River water level at Kherson had returned to its level before the dam was destroyed.[171] Before the destruction of the dam the water level was over 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft).[172] Oleksandr Kubrakov, Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine, announced on 3 July that Ukraine had begun the construction from scratch of three pipelines totaling almost 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) in order to supply drinking water to more than 1 million people from Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts.[173][174] He announced that \u20b41.5\u00a0billion (US$41M)[175] had been allocated to this from the Fund for Dealing with the Aftermath of Armed Aggression,[174] which as of 15\u00a0May had a total of \u20b461.6\u00a0billion (US$1.6B). Ukrhydroenergo also announced that it was working on a project to build an \"overlay\" across the dam and hydroelectric station that would restore water levels to the levels before the explosion.[176][177] The overlay project would start once Russian forces leave the east side of the Dnieper and would be expected to take two months.[176] Conversely, according to the Russian-installed governor of Kherson Vladimir Saldo, any restoration work on the dam and power plant will be performed by the Russian side, and only after Ukrainian troops are pushed away to a safe distance.[citation needed] There has been no announcement of a resolution to this impasse thus far. On 21 June, satellite images revealed that the reservoir had significantly dried up, exposing shallower parts, revealing the original course of the Dnipro and leading to the disconnection of four canal networks.[178][179] As of 20 June, the reservoir's water surface area had shrunk to 509.2\u00a0km2 (196.6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), less than a quarter of its former area.[180] A number of new wells are being dug to provide for the local water needs. According to Andriy Volodin, who is overseeing the work of digging new wells, after the water drained from the reservoir the water table in the area fell dramatically. Before the dam was destroyed, wells would reach groundwater at 38\u00a0m (125\u00a0ft) but by September they had to drill 60\u201370\u00a0m (200\u2013230\u00a0ft). According to Volodin, \"The weight of the Kakhovka Reservoir used to push the water up toward the surface. Now the pressure is gone, and it has receded.\" He said that the water from these wells, though a bit salty, will suffice for irrigation.[181] The village of Malokaterynivka lost its water supply and now must be supplied by truck.[141]"

        "content": "The North Crimean Canal, normally active from March until December,[183] is more than 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) long[184] and has traditionally supplied 85% of Crimea's water.[185] Up to 80% of this water was used in agriculture and 60% of that was used for rice farming and pond fish farming.[162] The southern coast around Sevastopol has its own water resources, so canal water is mostly needed in central and northern Crimea.[162] After the Russian takeover of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine blocked the canal, claiming that Crimea had accumulated a huge debt for water supplied the previous year.[186] This resulted in eight years of halted water flow, and was only unblocked in March\u00a02022 after the Russians gained control of Kherson Oblast. Land used for farming shrank from 450,000 to 15,000 hectares (1,112,000 to 37,000 acres), and rice and buckwheat cultivation had to be stopped.[162] The canal begins at Tavriisk, where the water intake is just upstream from the destroyed dam.[187] The Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka said that the dam's destruction would cause \"problems\" with water supplies to Crimea from the North Crimean Canal.[89] According to Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's press secretary, the dam's destruction was a \"calculated Ukrainian attempt to choke off water supplies\" to Crimea.[185][188] \"Clearly one of the aims of this act of sabotage was to deprive Crimea of water\u2014the water level in the reservoir is dropping and, accordingly, the water supply to the canal is being drastically reduced,\" he said.[189][190] The Crimean occupation authority said that there was \"no threat of the North Crimean Canal losing water\".[190][191] The reservoirs on the peninsula were filled to about 80% according to Sergey Aksyonov, the head of the Russian-annexed, but internationally unrecognised, Republic of Crimea.[185][192][193] On 10\u00a0June 2023 the Institute for the Study of War referenced a Russian video reportedly showing that the North Crimean Canal had become dry,[194][195] contradicting the recent Russian statements that there was no threat of the canal losing water. The Ukrainians accused the Russians of not having a clear plan on how to solve the problem, and trying to avoid the issue and resorting to propaganda in order to prevent panic among the local population instead of working in terms of infrastructure.[196] Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukraine's hydro electric company Ukrhydroenergo, said on 12\u00a0June 2023 that given that the water level in the Kakhovka Reservoir is much lower than the intake level of the North Crimean Canal, water would not flow to Crimea through the canal \"for at least a year\".[197] According to Christopher Binnie, a water engineer specializing in dams and water resources development, \"Pumping for water supply to the Crimea could restart fairly soon.\"[59] Sergey Aksyonov said that by installing pumps on the Dnieper River, up to 40 m3/sec could be supplied to the canal, and that this would improve the situation.[162] The normal flow rate of water in the North Crimean Canal seems to be subject to some disagreement, but according to the Ukrainian State Agency for Water Resources the normal water flow rate in the head of the canal is 82 m3/sec.[198] Concurring roughly with this is Agribusiness Global (90 m3/sec),[199] so the proposed rate by pumping would result in half the normal rate. Water flows through the North Crimean Canal by gravity until it reaches the Dzhankoi district, where it meets the first of a series of pumping stations that must pump it uphill. The first pumping station has a capacity of about 70 m3/sec.[200] According to First Deputy Prime Minister of Russian-annexed Crimea, Rustam Temirgaliyev in 2014, the normal flow of water through the North Crimean Canal was 50 m3/sec.[201] A number of other sources also report this figure.[186][202][203][204][205][206] Euromaidan Press reports 294 m3/sec[183] as does another source.[207] On the high end is a source reporting 380\u00a0m3/sec, with 80\u00a0m3/sec of this going to Kherson and the remainder going to Crimea.[208] According to a 2023 study, in the early 1990s annual water flows into the canal from the reservoir reached 3.5\u00a0km3, but a more economical use of water reduced this to 1.5\u00a0km3, of which 0.5\u00a0km3 were used in the Kherson Oblast and 1.0\u00a0km3 in Crimea. In 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, this was reduced to 0.5\u00a0km3, according to the study.[209] 1.5\u00a0km3 is the amount of water that would result from a flow of 47.5\u00a0m3/sec for one year. According to a 2017 study in a Russian journal, in 2013, the total water intake of Crimea amounted to 1,553.78\u00a0million m3, of which 86.65% came from the North Crimean Canal, 8.78% from local runoff, 4.41% from underground water, and 0.16% from seawater.[210] This means that 1,346.35\u00a0million m3 came from the canal, which translates to a flow rate of 42.7\u00a0m3/sec during 2013, according to this source. If 1\u20443 of the water entering the North Crimean Canal was distributed in Kherson, as indicated by the 2023 study, and 1,346.35\u00a0million m3 arrived in Crimea, then this indicates a water flow into the canal during 2013 of 64\u00a0m3/sec. The average flow in the Dnieper River is about 1,670\u00a0m3/sec.[211] The amount of water flowing past the intake point of the North Crimean Canal is regulated by the five reservoirs upstream on the Dnieper River, all controlled by Ukraine. Two major canals take in water upstream from the North Crimean Canal, from what was originally the Kakhovka Reservoir: the Kakhovsky Canal and the Dnieper-Kryvyi Rih canal.[212] Also taking water from the former Kakhovka Reservoir were various minor irrigation systems, freshwater fish farms, and systems supplying water to cities such as Zaporizhzhia. The total withdrawal of water from the Kakhovka Reservoir just for large canals was estimated at 900\u00a0m3/sec.[213]"

In 2021, farmers harvested from this land about 4\u00a0million tons of grains and oilseeds, representing about 4% of Ukraine's grains and oilseeds production. Ninety-four percent of the irrigation systems in Kherson Oblast, 74% of those in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and 30% of those in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast will be without water.[216][217] Even without the disaster, Ukraine's grains and oilseeds production was expected to be down 8% from the output of 2022, and down 36% from the output of 2021 (the year before the war began), according to the Ukrainian Grain Association.[218][219] Oleksandr Krasnolutskyi, Ukraine's deputy minister of environmental protection and natural resources,[220] stated that the floodwater has washed away the topsoil layers from thousands of hectares of farms and arable lands. \"We will not be able to cultivate agricultural plants on this soil for many years ahead,\" he said.[221] Ukraine is in no danger of famine. Before the war Ukraine harvested 50 million tons of grain but the domestic need was only 20\u00a0million tons. The dam disaster, however, will lead to lower farming revenue for Ukraine and could result in food shortages on world markets and potentially famine in poor countries that rely on Ukrainian grain exports.[215][222] The Ukrainian government has announced financial assistance for farmers affected by the dam destruction in the amount of \u20b43,318 (US$90)[223] for a vegetable harvest loss of 0.01\u00a0ha (0.025 acres), with a maximum of 0.2\u00a0ha (0.49 acres) in the Mykolaiv Oblast and 0.3\u00a0ha (0.74 acres) in the Kherson Oblast.[224]"

The Ministry said that the funds would enable affected residents to \"have the resources to repair their homes before winter\". More than 340\u00a0applications for compensation for crop losses were submitted and payments of Hr 2.7 million had been established.[239] Ukraine has begun the second stage of the \"e\u2011Restore\" program, designed to compensate residents for housing destroyed or damaged during the war.[240] The first stage, begun in May\u00a02023, was limited to \u20b4200,000 per house[241] (US$5,400),[242] and 1,400 applicants received \u20b4114\u00a0million[240] (US$3.1\u00a0million).[243] The second stage, begun 18 July, will not have restrictions on the amount of compensation but certain limitations apply,[240] and the amount to be compensated will be calculated according to a specific formula.[244] Stage two was described as a \"beta test\" and will only be operational in two villages in Kyiv Oblast,[240] but if successful it could be expanded to regions affected by the flooding when the dam collapsed."

On 18\u00a0July, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced the government's approval of a plan to rebuild the Hydroelectric Power Plant, which would last two years and involve two stages: designing all engineering structures and preparing the necessary base for restoration, and the actual construction work, which was to commence upon the removal of Russian forces from the area.[291] The proposed two-year time estimate is significantly less than the previous estimate of six years given by Ukrhydroenergo.[290][292] According to a study published in August\u00a02023, in just one year a temporary dam could be constructed near the site of the destroyed dam which would allow the refilling of the reservoir to at least 12.7\u00a0m (42\u00a0ft). This would allow water to be provided to all consumers, but there would be no hydropower or shipping. (The impact of the temporary absence of hydropower would be limited, since the amount of electricity produced at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant, the Kryvyi Rih thermal powerplant and the Zaporizhzhia thermal power plant exceeds the amount that had been generated by the Kakhovka hydropower plant by more than an order of magnitude.) This would allow an additional 350,000 hectares (860,000 acres) of land to be irrigated, according to the study. At the same time, the construction of a permanent dam and hydropower plant could be started.[209] Furthermore, according to the study, they made an error when constructing the original Kakhovka powerplant with only six hydropower units having a capacity of passing only 2,600\u00a0m3/s. The new powerplant should have at least eight units and a discharge capacity of at least 4,000\u00a0m3/s.[209] It has been reported that Rostec, a Russian state-owned defense conglomerate, plans to build 9\u00a0seawater desalination plants in Crimea by 2030, with a total capacity of about 1 billion m3 of freshwater per year.[293] This is the amount of water that flowed annually to Crimea through the North Crimean Canal prior to 2014, according to a 2023 study.[209] The problem is that these plants would require half the power generated for use by Crimea and Sevastopol in 2023. The expected cost would be \u20bd78 billion (US$808 million).[294] Two such plants are planned by 2023, costing \u20bd7.8\u00a0billion (US$80.8 million).[293] On 8\u00a0June, Zelenskyy visited flooded areas of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson.[295] Reports appeared on the same day that Russia was shelling Kherson and other localities of the region as evacuation efforts continued.[296] On 11 June, Ukrainian media and authorities claimed that Russian forces demolished a smaller dam, near the village of Kliuchove on the Mokri Yaly river in Donetsk Oblast, to slow down Ukrainian advances.[297][298][299] On 13 June, Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Environmental Safety Department and Mine Action representative Major Vladyslav Dudar reported that Russian forces have placed mines at a large number of small dams in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, and were destroying a number of them every day to disrupt Ukrainian counteroffensive operations.[300][301] On 12\u00a0June, Ukrainian intelligence claimed that Russia was mining the workshops of the Crimean Titan chemical factory in Armiansk, the explosion of which was feared to cause a major disaster.[302] According to retired Ukrainian colonel Roman Svitan\u00a0[et; uk], a destruction of the factory would temporarily hinder a hypothetical Ukrainian attack into Russian-controlled Crimea unless Ukrainian troops were given chemical protection suits.[303] On 7\u00a0June, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, in separate calls with Presidents Putin and Zelenskyy, proposed an international commission to investigate the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Erdogan said that such \"a commission could be established with the participation of experts from the warring parties, the United Nations and the international community, including Turkey, for a detailed investigation into the explosion\".[304] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba reacted negatively toward the proposal: \"We have already had this experience. This is all a giveaway game with the Russians. When our prisoners of war were killed in Olenivka and we told the UN: Send your mission, let them investigate. Do you think they got there? They didn't get there. I'll tell you more: This mission was quietly shut down by the United Nations, which is called \"no noise or dust\".[305] He called the proposal a \"game of quasi-justice\", and added, \"We've already been there. It's all just a game to indulge the Russians.\"[306] The reference to Olenivka was a reference to a fact-finding mission by the UN into the killing of 53\u00a0Ukrainian prisoners of war held by the Russians that was disbanded when the Russians denied access to the remaining prisoners.[307] The UN announced on 18\u00a0June that Russia has declined its requests to access the areas it occupied in order to deliver humanitarian aid. The UN urged the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law.[308] According to defense analyst Edward Stringer, the reasons for this Russian refusal appear to be that"

With 2,520 fires burning 978,519 acres (395,993\u00a0ha) of land, it was the largest wildfire season in Arizona since 2011.[1][2]  Wildfires occur year-round in the state but are most numerous and typically burn the largest swaths of land during spring and summer. Peak fire season in the Southwest typically runs from May, when conditions are windy, hot, and dry, through mid-July, when the North American Monsoon provides the region with precipitation to slow fire activity.[3] By the end of the year, more than fifty fires larger than 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha) had burned within the state. However, the most notable fire of the season, the Ocotillo Fire, burned only 980 acres (400\u00a0ha) over four days and threatened the town of Cave Creek. It destroyed 20 buildings, including 8 homes.[4]"

It was the deadliest tornado of the 2011 Super Outbreak, the largest tornado outbreak in United States history. The second of four EF5 tornadoes to touch down on April 27 (along with Philadelphia, Smithville, and Rainsville), the tornado reached a maximum width of 1.25 miles (2.01\u00a0km) and was estimated to have had peak winds of 210\u00a0mph (340\u00a0km/h).[2] The tornado first touched down at 3:05\u00a0p.m. CDT (2005 UTC) southwest of Hamilton, Alabama, before quickly becoming violent and reaching EF5 intensity as it approached and struck Hackleburg, destroying a large portion of the town. The tornado maintained EF5 intensity as it struck Phil Campbell, again sweeping numerous homes off foundations, and then peaking in intensity and width shortly afterwards as it entered more rural areas. It weakened somewhat thereafter but re-strengthened as it hit Tanner (previously hit by two F5s in the 1974 Super Outbreak). It fluctuated afterwards before significantly weakening as it crossed into Tennessee, before re-strengthening again briefly for the last time, causing EF3 damage in rural areas before dissipating in the mountainous areas further east near Huntland at 5:40\u00a0p.m. CDT (2240 UTC).[3] In total, the tornado was on the ground for well over two hours, making it the second-longest lived tornado of the outbreak. Hundreds of homes were either destroyed or reduced to foundations as a result of the tornado. In total, this tornado killed 72 people, all in Alabama. This made it the deadliest single tornado ever to strike the state of Alabama as well as (at the time) the deadliest in the United States since a 1955 tornado in Udall, Kansas killed 80 people \u2013 the 2011 Joplin tornado a month later killed 158.[4][5] In addition to being the deadliest, this tornado also had the longest track of any tornado in the outbreak, with its path extending 132 miles (212\u00a0km) across Northern Alabama and into Tennessee.[6] Damage wrought by the tornado amounted to $1.29\u00a0billion (2011 USD), making it the seventh-costliest tornado in U.S. history."

        "content": "The environmental conditions leading up to the 2011 Super Outbreak were among the \"most conducive to violent tornadoes ever documented\".[7] On April\u00a025, a vigorous upper-level shortwave trough moved into the Southern Plains states.[8] Ample instability, low-level moisture, and wind shear all fueled a significant tornado outbreak from Texas to Tennessee; at least 64\u00a0tornadoes touched down on this day.[7] An area of low pressure consolidated over Texas on April\u00a026 and traveled east while the aforementioned shortwave trough traversed the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.[9] Another 50\u00a0tornadoes touched down on this day.[7] The multi-day outbreak culminated on April\u00a027 with the most violent day of tornadic activity since the 1974 Super Outbreak. Multiple episodes of tornadic activity ensued with two waves of mesoscale convective systems in the morning hours followed by a widespread outbreak of supercells from Mississippi to North Carolina during the afternoon into the evening.[7] Tornadic activity on April\u00a027 was precipitated by a 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.39\u00a0inHg) surface low situated over Kentucky and a deep, negatively tilted (aligned northwest to southeast) trough over Arkansas and Louisiana. A strong southwesterly surface jet intersected these systems at a 60\u00b0 angle, an ageostrophic flow that led to storm-relative helicity values in excess of 500\u00a0m2s\u22122\u2014indicative of extreme wind shear and a very high potential for rotating updrafts within supercells. Ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico was brought north across the Deep South, leading to daytime high temperatures of 77 to 81\u00a0\u00b0F (25 to 27\u00a0\u00b0C) and dewpoints of 66 to 72\u00a0\u00b0F (19 to 22\u00a0\u00b0C). Furthermore, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values reached 2,500\u20133,000\u00a0J/kg\u22121.[7]"

        "content": "The tornado initially touched down in Marion County, Alabama about 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) west-southwest of Hamilton around 3:05 pm CDT and tracked to the northeast, causing significant tree and roof damage. Damage at the beginning of the path ranged from EF1 to EF2. The tornado reached EF4 strength as it approached US 43. As it approached Hackleburg, moving parallel to US 43, the tornado further strengthened to EF5 intensity and widened to 0.75 miles (1.21\u00a0km), sweeping away numerous homes along the highway.[10] One large brick home along Hayfield Road was swept completely away, with vehicles from the house thrown 150 yards (140\u00a0m). Patches of scoured grass were also noted on the property.[10][11] The tornado maintained EF5 strength as it struck Hackleburg directly, sweeping away numerous homes, destroying three schools, a Piggly Wiggly grocery store, a shopping center, and a Wrangler Jeans plant, and tossing cars as far as 200 yards (180\u00a0m) from where they originated. At least one of the homes swept away in Hackleburg was bolted to its foundation, and a brick home in the city's southwest portion had its poured concrete stem walls sheared off at ground level. Extensive wind-rowing of debris was also noted in the area.[10][12] Jeans from the Wrangler plant reportedly fell from the sky in Courtland, Alabama, roughly 40 miles (64\u00a0km) away. Photographs were recovered as far away as Tennessee.[13] The tornado completely debarked numerous trees in town, and even tore up poured concrete from the ground at one location.[14] Several buildings in downtown Hackleburg were badly damaged as well. According to the Red Cross, 75% of the town was destroyed. A total of 18 people died in the Hackleburg area.[15][16]  While the damage was initially rated EF3, after further analysis of the damage in and around Hackleburg, the rating was increased to EF5, making it the first F5 or EF5 tornado in Alabama since the Birmingham tornado of April 8, 1998. The presence of well-built homes swept away, extensive wind-rowing, and cars thrown hundreds of yards were the main factors that led to the EF5 rating in Hackleburg.[10][17]"

The tornado then tore right through Phil Campbell at EF5 intensity, sweeping away numerous homes, a few of which even had their block foundations destroyed as well. Some of the homes swept away were well-constructed. A 25-foot (7.6\u00a0m) section of pavement was scoured from a road in Phil Campbell, with chunks of asphalt scattered up to 1\u20443 mile (0.54\u00a0km) away, and numerous trees were completely denuded and debarked, one of which had a car wrapped around it. Three churches were destroyed, one of which was reduced to a bare slab. Multiple mobile homes were obliterated as well, with their mangled frames tossed up to 50 yards (46\u00a0m) away.[2] An underground storm shelter in town had its concrete roof torn off, and grass was scoured from hillsides.[14] EF4 and EF5 damage continued as the tornado exited Phil Campbell and tore through rural areas, sweeping away additional homes as it roughly followed County Roads 81 and 82.[2] The tornado then reached its maximum intensity as it tore through the rural community of Oak Grove, with the damage intensity reaching well into the EF5 range and a path width over a mile wide. Oak Grove suffered a large swath of total devastation as large and well-built brick homes with extensive anchoring were swept completely away, with the debris strewn and wind-rowed long distances through nearby fields. A Corvette was thrown 641 feet (195\u00a0m) and severely mangled, and a vehicle missing from one residence was never found. A large metal chicken house completely vanished, with nothing recovered at the site but a single piece of metal truss, and numerous large trees in this area were completely debarked.[2] A total of 27 people were killed in Franklin County, mainly in and around Phil Campbell.[18] The tornado continued into Lawrence County and maintained EF5 strength as it struck the small town of Mount Hope, where significant devastation was incurred to single-family homes and a restaurant. Nothing but the foundation and a pile of debris remained at the restaurant site, and a small portion of the restaurant's foundation slab buckled. Thousands of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped, with a significant number of trees twisted and debarked with only stubs of branches remaining. Many mobile homes were also destroyed with the frames mangled, and a single-family home was completely destroyed, with the walls and contents strewn over a hundred yards.[2] WAAY-TV meteorologist and Mount Hope resident Gary Dobbs spotted the tornado from his front window but was unable to get to his storm shelter because he was giving a live report to viewers of WAAY. While the house was destroyed around him, Dobbs was thrown 40 feet (12\u00a0m) from his residence. The door of the storm shelter on the property was torn off, but no friends therein were seriously injured. Dobbs required hospitalization.[19][20]"

At this location, four chicken houses were completely destroyed with much of the debris wrapped around debarked trees. TVA high voltage power line trusses were also destroyed at this location.[2] The tornado continued northeast at EF3 strength as it struck Langtown, where multiple homes lost their roofs or had only interior walls left standing, and a gas station and a store sustained significant damage. The tornado re-intensified to high-end EF4 strength as it passed northwest of Moulton and Trinity, completely destroying multiple homes and mobile homes. Several cars were tossed into fields and wrapped around debarked trees along County Road 291 and 292. Tree and mobile home damage continued along County Roads 217 and 222, where a handful of large high voltage TVA power poles were destroyed, cutting off electricity delivery from Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant. EF4 damage continued northeast towards SR 20, where a restaurant was completely destroyed and two single-family houses were significantly damaged. A total of 14 people were killed in Lawrence County.[21] Tree damage continued into extreme northwestern Morgan County.[2] The tornado continued a short stretch through the northwest corner of Morgan County, crossing Wheeler Lake, and into Limestone County, coming within approximately 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) of Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant and toppling nearly a dozen high voltage power lines in Limestone County, snapping concrete power poles at their bases.[22] These power lines delivered electricity from Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant, and without the outlet, the plant had to be shut down. The tornado continued towards the small community of Tanner.[23][6] Tanner experienced a large swath of EF4 damage and a narrow corridor of \"high-end EF4 to near-EF5 damage\".[22] The storm completely swept away several well-constructed homes with anchor bolting.[22] One home was scattered over 300 yards (270\u00a0m) with large items carried completely away. Intense ground scarring occurred in this area.[2] The storm also tossed a large cargo container approximately 600 yards and carried several cars airborne for hundreds of yards. Several homes, a mobile home park, and a church that were destroyed by the 1974 Tanner tornadoes and later rebuilt, were destroyed once again by this tornado. As it crossed US 72 in eastern Limestone County, the tornado destroyed a privately owned radar and tower camera operated by NBC affiliate WAFF and continued into East Limestone, a more populated area of Limestone County where numerous homes were damaged or destroyed, with several leveled at high-end EF3 intensity in a subdivision at the corner of McCulley Mill Road and Capshaw Road. (Imagery from WAFF's radar, as seen during the station's coverage of the tornado outbreak, showed the graphical linear \"sweep\" indicating the scanning antenna dish briefly swaying violently in a ~70\u00b0 horizontal curve as the tornado blew the dome and equipment off the radar tower. The tornado was viewed on the camera shortly before it was destroyed.) The tornado then crossed into Madison County, tearing through the suburban communities of Harvest and Toney. Many homes in Harvest were damaged or destroyed, especially in the Anderson Hills subdivision (which was also significantly impacted by a violent tornado in 1995). Numerous two-story homes were destroyed at that location, with a few that were flattened or reduced to their block foundations. Numerous trees were snapped and debarked, and several mobile homes were swept completely away. The tornado destroyed a Piggly Wiggly grocery store in Harvest, and also severely damaged a convenience store and local bank, which was shut down for months following the event. Damage in Harvest was rated low-end EF4.[24] In Toney, the Carter's Gin subdivision was devastated as multiple poorly-anchored homes were leveled at high-end EF3 strength. The tornado then weakened significantly, twisting irrigation equipment and producing only intermittent EF0 tree damage southwest of Hazel Green and through rural areas. The tornado would rapidly dissipate after this, with its final damage being inflicted near the community of Gladstone.[25][2] In all, hundreds of homes received moderate to major damage along the path from Limestone to Madison County with many of these being total losses, and 13 people were killed.[22][26][27]"

Damage from the tornado amounted to $1.29\u00a0billion, making this one of the costliest tornadoes in U.S. history. This tornado also had the longest track of any tornado in the outbreak, with its path extending 132 miles (212\u00a0km) across Northern Alabama and into Tennessee.[3] In response to the damage in Phil Campbell, one of the hardest hit communities, writer Phil Campbell organized a fundraising and relief effort composed of 20 people with the name Phil Campbell or variations thereof. These Phil Campbells traveled to the community from places as far away as Australia to aid in the cleanup effort. Many of these people had planned to attend a convention in June, 2011 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city's incorporation.[32][33]"

Nanmadol developed over in the Philippine Sea as a tropical depression on July\u00a01, and strengthened into the third named storm of the 2017 typhoon season on July\u00a03. After gaining organization, the system rapidly developed and intensified into a severe tropical storm and reached its peak intensity with a 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 985\u00a0hPa (29.1\u00a0inHg). On July\u00a04, Nanmadol turned eastwards and made landfall near Nagasaki, Kyushu, just before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Nanmadol dropped torrential rainfall across Kyushu, resulting in landslides, although the Fukuoka and \u014cita Prefectures were the hardest hit. The city of Asakura, Fukuoka experienced a one-day rainfall surpassing the city's average total for July by 50%, with a rainfall of 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) recorded within a 12-hour period on July\u00a05. Landslides were recorded in 44 different locations and flooding in 38 locations, and from this, more than 2,600 homes were destroyed. In total, 42 people died from Nanmadol due to drowning from flash flooding or due to landslides. Total damages was estimated to have toppled to \u00a5190\u00a0billion (US$1.68\u00a0billion)."

Due to the threat of further landslides, the West Nippon Expressway Company extended a closure of the \u014cita Expressway.[28] Trees with trunks of 50\u201360\u00a0cm (19.5\u201323.5\u00a0in) were washed away, blocking the water stream further and exacerbating floods. Therefore, on July\u00a011, Forestry Minister Yuji Yamamoto pledged to set up a task force to remove driftwood. Meanwhile, an official at the University of Hyogo warned other municipalities of potential damage caused by fallen trees.[29] Peak windspeeds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) were recorded in Nagasaki upon landfall, including a 162\u00a0km/h (101\u00a0mph) wind gust in the Shikoku town of Muroto just after 05:30\u00a0UTC.[30][31] Strong winds overturned vehicles, collapsed scaffolding, and left 68,500 homes without power in Nagasaki and Kumamoto prefectures; other blackouts occurred in the prefectures of \u014cita, Miyazaki and Kagoshima.[31][32] Around 3,000 airline passengers were affected by the grounding and cancellation of at least 47 flights. Heavy rains and strong winds disrupted numerous train services including the iconic Shinkansen, between Hakata and Kagoshima-Chuo in Kyushu.[31][32] Evacuation advisories were issued to at least 20,000 residents due to fears of possible flooding and landslides, especially in the Niigata, Toyama and Nagano prefectures that had experienced rainfall accumulations of up to 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) in the preceding hours.[32] In Hamada, Shimane, over 80\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in) fell in an hour.[33][25] At least three people were injured during the storm\u2014a young boy's hand was injured when a school window broke in the city of Kumamoto, and two adults in \u014cita prefecture sustained injuries from falls as a result of the strong winds.[32][34] About 180 people took shelter at a junior high school gymnasium in Asakura.[27] Within the prefecture, 130\u00a0mm (5.1\u00a0in) of rain fell in an hour, greatly contributing to a 24-hour rainfall total of 545\u00a0mm (21.5\u00a0in).[35] A later report showed that the prefecture experienced a total accumulated rainfall of 632.5\u00a0mm (24.90\u00a0in).[36] The city of Hita, \u014cita also experienced extreme rainfall, with accumulations of 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in).[37] However the prefecture of Fukuoka experienced an incredible amount of 774\u00a0mm (30.5\u00a0in) of rain within the course of nine hours on July 5.[38] Due to the risk of landslides, an evacuation order which covered 316 people from 115 households was issued in the Haki District of Asakura, due to high risk of landslides. Throughout the Fukuoka and \u014cita Prefectures, 1,724 people evacuated.[28] More than 2,600 homes were destroyed by Nanmadol around the Fukuoka, Oita, and the Hiroshima prefectures,[39] but a later report showed a total of 4,458 buildings damaged.[40] Nearly a week after the flooding had begun, some roads were already reopened over in some communities in the Fukuoka Prefecture.[29] During July\u00a012, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe canceled a trip to Estonia for a European tour and instead visited devastated places over in the Kyushu region to view the damage and console residents. He also promised that the government would take action and do everything possible to help rebuild.[41][42] A total of 42 people have been confirmed dead due to torrential rains which caused landslides and flooding, particularly in Kyushu,[39][43] where two still remained missing and leaving 39 people injured.[40][36]  Total damages in Japan were amounted to be \u00a5190\u00a0billion (US$1.68\u00a0billion).[40]"

Near its upper end, the lake surface lies more than 6,600\u00a0ft (2,000\u00a0m) below peaks less than 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) away.[3][4] Before 1927, Lake Chelan was the largest natural lake in the state in terms of both surface area and water volume.[2][5] Upon the completion of Lake Chelan Dam in 1927, the elevation of the lake was increased by 21\u00a0ft (6.4\u00a0m) to its present maximum-capacity elevation of 1,100\u00a0ft (340\u00a0m).[2] With a maximum depth of 1,486\u00a0ft (453\u00a0m), Lake Chelan is the third deepest lake in the United States behind Crater Lake, the deepest, and Lake Tahoe, the second deepest. Because of overdeepening, the sides of this lake drop steeply to its bottom. The deepest part of Lake Chelan lies as much as 436\u00a0ft (133\u00a0m) below sea level. In places, the bedrock floor of the valley occupied by Lake Chelan, which is buried by Pleistocene glacial and lacustrine sediments, lies at least 1,529\u00a0ft (466\u00a0m) below sea level. Two communities lie on the southern end of the lake, and a third sits at the far north end, providing a gateway to the North Cascades National Park.[3][4]"

With a maximum depth of 1,486 feet (453\u00a0m),[6] Lake Chelan is the third deepest lake in the United States, and the 25th deepest in the world. At its deepest, the lake bottom is 388 feet (118\u00a0m) below sea level.[9] The total watershed of the lake is 924 square miles (2,390\u00a0km2)[7][10][11] More than 90% of the watershed is forested land.

At that time, in the upper Similkameen River valley of British Columbia, the Skagit Lobe split from the Okanogan Lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet and advanced south into the Skagit River drainage.[14] Skagit ice passed through Fisher and Rainy passes, and down Bridge Creek into the Lake Chelan valley. The glacial lobe flowed down the Lake Chelan valley until meeting glacial ice of the main Okanogan Lobe advancing up the valley from the Columbia River drainage near Manson. The deposits of the northwestward advancing Okanagan lobe are characterized by large, basalt glacial erratics.[4] As the Skagit Lobe during the Last Glacial Maximum and glacial lobes during older glaciations flowed to the southeast down the Lake Chelan valley, they excavated the deep glacial trough that is now occupied by Lake Chelan.[14] The depth of the Lucerne Basin and the elevation of glacial till and moraines and glacier-scoured bedrock on the walls of the overdeepened Lake Chelan valley indicates that the thickness of the Skagit Lobe was over 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km).[3][4]"

The upper basin, Lucerne, is much deeper and extends for the remainder of the length of the lake. The two basins are separated by a sill rising to within 122\u00a0ft (37\u00a0m) of the surface, at a point known as the narrows, at which the lake is only 0.35 miles (0.56\u00a0km) wide.[9] The lower basin, Wapato, reaches a maximum depth of only 400 feet (120\u00a0m). About 600 feet (180\u00a0m) of glacial sediment and rockslide deposits rest on top of the bedrock.[15] This section of the lake is 12 miles (19\u00a0km) long, and has an average depth of 190 feet (58\u00a0m).[16]  Due to the relatively modest size of this basin, water resides in this basin for only 0.8 years, compared to 10 for Lucerne Basin.[17]  The upper Lucerne basin is 38 miles (61\u00a0km) long with an average depth of 1,148 feet (350\u00a0m) and thus by far the larger of the two basins.[16] It is in this part of the lake that the maximum depth of 1,486 feet (453\u00a0m) is found. Lucerne basin contains 92% of the water in Lake Chelan and 74% of the surface area, leaving Wapato with only 8% of the total volume of water and 26% of the surface area.[8][9][15] The upper basin of Lake Chelan is surrounded by more mountainous terrain, resulting in few beaches along the shoreline.  Approximately 50 miles (80\u00a0km) of the shoreline of this basin are in National Forest lands, and 12 miles (19\u00a0km) in National Park lands.[8]"

Crane next awakens in 2013 Sleepy Hollow, with Washington's Bible to guide him. He meets Sheriff's Lt. Abigail Mills and learns that the Horseman has also returned. Crane learns that he and Abbie are the two Witnesses of Revelation, and the Horseman is Death. Should he regain his severed head, his master, Moloch, would be released from Purgatory and the End of Days would occur. Crane also learns that his wife, Katrina, a witch, was banished to Purgatory for saving him. His blunder has linked his life with the Horseman's. Fighting off Moloch's army of demons, Crane discovers that the Horseman of War is his own son, Jeremy Crane/Henry Parish, who loathes Crane and Katrina for abandoning him. Crane also learns that \"Headless\" is actually his former friend, Abraham Von Brunt. Crane and Abbie manage to defeat Moloch, but at the cost of releasing everything trapped in Purgatory, including demons looking for a replacement for Moloch. Henry convinces Katrina to side with him and awaken the descendants of their coven, but both are killed by Crane, who is filled with regret and remorse. In the following months, Crane investigates all myths about the Witnesses, learning that Moloch was the first of Seven Tribulations. The second comes in the form of Pandora and her master, the Hidden One, an ancient Sumerian god. Because Moloch is dead (and thus cannot end the world), Crane gives the Horseman back his head, allowing him to destroy Pandora. However, the head is sucked into Pandora's box, which is destroyed. This battle costs Abigail her soul. Learning that there will always be two Witnesses, Crane vows to find her replacement and face the last five Tribulations. Relocating to Washington D.C., Crane discovers that the next Witness is a young girl named Molly.  Crane works with her mother, Agent Diana Thomas of Homeland Security, to combat supernatural threats until Molly is old enough to help. Crane also allies with Agency 355 agents Jake Wells and Alex Norwood, taking command of the organization as George Washington wished. The third tribulation comes in the form of Malcolm Dreyfuss, who sold his soul to build his business. Dreyfuss seeks immortality for he fears death. After Dreyfuss becomes immortal, he decides to assemble the Four Horsemen, kill the President and take over the United States of America. A woman named Lara arrives from the future that Dreyfuss wishes to create, revealing herself to be an alternate version of young Molly. Because she is in her prime, Lara takes the Witness title from Molly, releasing her past self from the burden. Crane is forced to make a deal with the devil for a piece of the philosophers' stone that will strip Dreyfuss of his immortality and send him to Hell. While Lara goes on a journey to discover her place in the world, Crane continues working with Agent Thomas to combat supernatural threats, hoping that he can someday escape his bargain with the devil."

The meteorological service issued 14 severe weather warnings and watches. In addition, the Fiordland Region reported 100mm of rain in 12 hours. That morning, 72mm of rain fell in the Southland town of Gore, causing significant surface flooding. This flooding overwhelmed the stormwater and wastewater network in Gore and Mataura. That afternoon, Mayor of Gore Ben Bell declared a state of emergency for the Southland Region.[4] Though an evacuation centre was established in Mataura Community Centre, Mataura Community Board chair Nicky Coats confirmed that the evacuation was not carried out since the rain had subsided. Due to heavy rainfall, the Roxburgh Dam in Central Otago released more water into the Clutha River on 21 September, raising the water level.[5] The Otago resort town of Queenstown also experienced flooding and landslides, leading to the evacuation of several homes. Some Queenstown residents had to be rescued from their cars. Emergency Management Southland also reported that the Tuatapere  water  treatment plant had been inundated by floodwater by 7:30 pm, leaving the town with eight hours' of drinking water. Residents were instructed to conserve water and to avoid showering, washing dishes, or flushing the toilet. In response, the Southland District Council dispatched three water tankers to provide Tuatapere with drinking water.[4] Heavy rainfall also caused landslides at several Queenstown locations including Reavers Lane, Fernhill, the Glenorchy-Queenstown Rd, Bob's Peak, and Wilson's Bay[4][6] St Peter's College in Gore was also completely flooded. In response to the flooding, Emergency Management Southland established community emergency hubs at Gore's Croydon Lodge and the Mataura Community Centre. Police also rescued several individuals from trapped cars in Gore and Queenstown.[4] According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), Queenstown recorded its wettest day in 24 years on 21 September, with 87mm of rain falling during that period. Similarly, W\u0101naka experienced its wettest day in 17 years, recording 98mm of rain on 21 September.[7]"

To allow for its reopening, fencing was placed around the damaged area.[10][11] Queenstown cemetery is located near Bob's Peak, which is below the Skyline Queenstown resort. According to Skyline chief executive Geoff McDonald, heavy rain had pooled on the top forestry track on 21 September, creating a waterfall and landslide that carried mud, stacked logs, and forestry debris down Bob's Peak into central Queenstown. For the past two years, Skyline had been clearing wilding pines on the hillside to create a firebreak around the gondola and Queenstown's Red Zone.[6] To get to Queenstown, people from the West Coast had to take a 1,000km detour due to flood debris on State Highway 6 (Haast Pass).[10] Waka Kotahi's Otago and Southland systems manager Robert Choveaux confirmed that the highway would remain close for the near future and estimated that 20,000 cubic metres of debris needed to be removed before its reopening.[12] On 22 September, the Queenstown Lakes District Council (QLDC) launched its first \"mop up action\" after the rain cleared. A geotechnical engineer and drone were used to assess damage to the township. Despite the flooding, local authorities confirmed that Queenstown was open to tourists.[7] The QLDC evacuated 55 people from Queenstown's Reavers Lane, and categorised 10 homes as \"red-stickered\" and two homes as \"yellow-stickered\" as a result of the flood damage.[13][3] By 24 September, 15 of these evacuees were still unable to return home due to flood damage and landslides.[3] The Queenstown Lakes District Council established an evacuation centre at the Queenstown Memorial Hall, which was subsequently moved to the local Holiday Inn. Due to a communications failure, the Council accidentally directed 100 evacuees to the locked St Peters Church. Vicar Dr Michael Godrey told the Otago Daily Times that the QLDC had failed to inform him that they had designated the church as an evacuation centre.[14]"

Bell and the Gore District Council stated that the roads were safe to travel but advised motorists to look out for flood debris. Gore fire chief Steve Lee stated that local volunteer firefighters and neighbouring brigades had spent the past 24 hours responding to the flooding. The Ng\u0101 Kete Matauranga Pounamu Charitable Trust assisted with emergency food donations in the Southland region.[5] By 23 September, Emergency Management Southland group controller Simon Mapp had lifted the regional state of emergency, with Southland moving into a local transition period.

The flooding in Manitoba was expected to mostly involve the 2011 Red River Flood but instead the more severe flooding was found on the Assiniboine in the west."
      },
      {
        "header": "Early signs",
        "content": "The 2011 flood first began in the fall of 2010 with several major rainfall events and generally wet conditions. Initially, it was predicted that the flood along the Assiniboine River would be similar to the flood of 1995.[3] During the winter of 2010\u20132011 the Shellmouth Reservoir was emptied in preparation, to store water for the coming spring flood. With more and more precipitation, the estimates on the flood were revised upwards. The first major settlement to experience the floodwater was St. Lazare, Manitoba which was located near the confluence of the Assiniboine River and Qu'Appelle River. Dikes were built up to protect against the rising floodwater, but unfortunately some residences were not spared as their protective dikes were overwhelmed. The flood continued downstream, spilling over its banks and flooding campgrounds and fields in the flood plain. Brandon, Manitoba's second largest city, prepared well in advance of the anticipated flood building up both earthen dikes as well as sandbag/Hesco bastion dikes. After a heavy snowfall on April 29 and 30 over much of the Assiniboine River watershed the crest forecast for Brandon was revised upward well above the flood of 1976. The river peaked at about 36,700\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (1,040\u00a0m3/s),60% higher than the previous highest recorded peak of 23,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (650\u00a0m3/s) in 1923. The 2011 event is estimated to be a 1 in 300-year flood.[4] Shortly thereafter a state of emergency was declared in Brandon as well as other municipalities across Manitoba.[5][6][7] Premier Greg Selinger requested from Prime Minister Stephen Harper troops from the Canadian military to help with the flood fighting efforts. The last time the military was called in to help fight a flood in Manitoba was the 1997 Red River flood. Downstream of Brandon, the Manitoba Government forecast that between 54000-56000 cu\u00a0ft/s of water would enter into the Portage Diversion reservoir near Portage la Prairie.[8] The capacity for the Portage Diversion channel, which drains into Lake Manitoba, is only approximately 25,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (710\u00a0m3/s), which would mean that between 29000-31000 cu\u00a0ft/s of water would flow toward communities such as Poplar Point, St. Francois Xavier, and Headingley, before joining with the Red River at The Forks.[9] This amount of water would overwhelm the dikes downstream, along the Assiniboine River, which were only built to allow for a channel capacity of about 10,000-11,000 cu\u00a0ft/s before spilling over. Otherwise breaching of dikes would occur.[8] On June 22, 2011 the city of Minot in North Dakota issued an evacuation of 12,000 residents due to the swollen Souris River that flows through the city. The Souris River starts in Saskatchewan and makes its way south across the border and then back north into Manitoba. The Souris River then eventually joins up with the Assiniboine River past Brandon which could again raise water levels on the Assiniboine due to the swollen Souris and the possibility of Lake Manitoba raising up again. Preparations are under way for the communities along the Souris to raise dikes and evacuations have begun. The province has said it will push the limits of the flood protection again."

        "header": "Intentional breach and flooding",
        "content": "It was determined by the Manitoba government that the capacity could be increased to 32000-34000 cu\u00a0ft/s by building up the banks of the Portage Diversion, depending on hydraulic resistance on bridges along the channel.[8] This would reduce the flows on the Assiniboine River somewhat, but still not enough for the dikes to hold. It was also determined that a controlled release of water from the Assiniboine in the range of 2000\u20136000 cu\u00a0ft/s should be created downstream of the Portage Diversion in order to reduce flows on the river, and divert the water into the La Salle River watershed,[10] resulting in more manageable river levels along the Assiniboine River. The exact location decided on was at the Hoop and Holler Bend. The controlled breach of the dike was estimated to flood approximately 225 square kilometres (87\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). This option was chosen as opposed to risking an uncontrolled breach, which could release as much as 500 square kilometres (190\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) with flows of up to 15,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (420\u00a0m3/s), while over 800 homes would be affected by the waters.[10] Military personnel were assigned to build flood protection in Brandon, on the Assiniboine River west of Portage la Prairie, and for residences that were at risk of flooding due to the controlled breach. The intentional breach and overland flooding began on Saturday May, 14.[11] The resultant flooding was very slow moving and was expected to take several days to reach the La Salle River. The waters intentionally spilled from the Assiniboine were expected to cover 185 square kilometres (71\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and flood a possible 150 homes.[12] The Expected crest at the Portage Reservoir was then downgraded to around 52,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (1,500\u00a0m3/s), leading some engineers to question the necessity of the breach at Hoop & Holler Bend as between the Portage Diversion (34,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (960\u00a0m3/s)) and the Assiniboine River Channel (up to 20,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (570\u00a0m3/s)) could have handled the floodwater.[13] The controlled breach has carried no more than 400\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (11\u00a0m3/s) and flooding was modest."

        "header": "Effects on Lake Manitoba",
        "content": "With the diversion of water from the Assiniboine using the Portage Diversion into Lake Manitoba, the water level on the lake increased. Increasing the capacity of the Diversion put surrounding residences in danger of being flooded, also prompting an evacuation of Delta Beach on Lake Manitoba. Due to the increased capacity of the diversion and the duration of its use, it increased water levels on Lake Manitoba significantly, more than the 1976 Assiniboine River Flood, which resulted in approximately 1,420,000 acre-feet (1.75\u00a0km3) of water being diverted.[14] In 2011 a total of 4,768,000 acre-feet (5.881\u00a0km3) [15] was diverted into the lake. The Manitoba Government's projections indicated that excluding the outflows of Lake Manitoba through the Fairford River resulted in an increase of 1.22 feet (0.37\u00a0m) in the level of the lake [1] Archived May 28, 2016, at the Wayback Machine. The Flood of 2011 surpassed these totals, causing flooding to Lake Manitoba and peaked at 817.2 feet (249.1\u00a0m) above sea level, 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) above the normal operating range . This led to flood fighting efforts shifting from the Assiniboine River to Lake Manitoba.[10][16][17]\nA technical review of the 2011 flood completed in October, 2013 concluded that the net effect of artificial works (Fairford River improvements and the Portage Diversion) was a rise of 0.3 feet (0.091\u00a0m) on the lake.[18] However, the rise occurred in weeks, rather than years as would occur in natural conditions."

An F2 tornado that impacted the towns of Sweet Home and College Station, destroying homes, mobile homes, and a church. The tornado downed many trees and power lines and injured 8 people.[5] Another F2 tornado near Union heavily damaged a dairy barn and the roofs of several homes. Many trees were downed, and three mobile homes were destroyed, resulting in a fatality and three injuries.[6] An F3 tornado touched down near Reed, and moved northeast. Roofs were damaged at several homes. In addition, the tornado rolled a 500-gallon butane tank, damaged or destroyed metal barns and sheds, and knocked down hundreds of trees. Near the town of Kelso, the tornado completely destroyed a metal farm shop, and pieces of debris from the structure were found 6 miles away. Also near the shop, a pickup truck was mangled with several large farm implements thrown, overturned or destroyed. A tractor-trailer was flipped before the tornado dissipated near Snow Lake.[7] Tornado activity began to spread into Mississippi later that night, and an F3 tornado caused major damage near Greenwood.[8] Another F3 tornado touched down near Bruce before moving east and slamming into Pontotoc, where major damage occurred. At least 360 homes, 15 businesses and 2 churches were damaged or destroyed in Pontotoc. Among the homes destroyed was a restored antebellum plantation home listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Numerous trees and power lines were blown down. Six people were killed in town, and 43 others were injured. The tornado then struck Baldwyn, where 100 homes were damaged or destroyed, and the Baldwyn High School which lost the roof to its gymnasium. Past Baldwyn, the tornado struck Guntown, where 8 homes and 1 business were heavily damaged, while 13 other structures were damaged. Lesser damage occurred in \nSaltillo and Wheeler before the tornado dissipated. Additional weak tornadoes occurred in Tennessee on the 25th before the event came to an end.

One supercell passed over northern St. Louis producing ten tornadoes, one of which (rated F1) destroyed a mobile home, killing one and injuring two.  Tornadoes occurred as far east as southwestern Illinois,[13][16] but the supercell is more memorable for exceptionally widespread large hail.  With some hailstones up to baseball size, the swath is the largest continuous in areal coverage and longest in length and duration of very large hail known.  Because of the extensive area and heavily populated areas impacted, it is the costliest hailstorm in U.S. history, with $2 billion of insured losses.[17] The next stage of the outbreak was a swarm of tornadoes which formed on the night of the 10th into the pre-dawn hours of the 11th in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska. One person was killed and eleven were injured in this stage, mostly by F2 tornadoes.[4] After a short break, a third bunch of tornadoes were spawned in and close to the state of Iowa in the late morning through the afternoon. Mostly weaker tornadoes, there were a few significant tornadoes. One, rated F2, destroyed a lodge in the town of Agency, killing two people and injuring three.

The Storm Prediction Center was already predicting a chance of thunderstorms on Wednesday. The area forecast discussion started mentioning a \"severe potential\" on Tuesday, also mentioning \"severe storms with large hail and damaging winds possible\". By the morning of October 24, the SPC was on its highest alert after issuing a high risk for severe weather for Indiana, middle Kentucky, eastern Illinois, southern Michigan, and western Ohio. The surrounding area was in a slight risk. At 5:00 A.M., a severe weather outlook was issued highlighting the fact that the area was under a high risk as well as a possibility of tornadoes. By 11:30 A.M., the SPC issued a Public Severe Weather Outlook calling for \"intense tornadoes\" in the area. Just 15 minutes later, the SPC issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Watch for northern Indiana, and northwestern Ohio. At around 12:30 P.M., a line of storms began forming in central and eastern Illinois and moved east. The town of Monticello, Illinois was struck by an F2 tornado, where homes and businesses were severely damaged.[55] At around 3:12 P.M., a tornado warning was issued for LaPorte County. This tornado killed a 50-year-old woman when her modular home was swept away near LaPorte. At 3:15, another tornado watch was issued for southern Michigan. At 3:46, another tornado warning was issued for St. Joseph County, Indiana and southeastern Berrien County, Michigan and Cass County. A few minutes later, the strongest of the outbreak, rated F3, touched down and did major damage to buildings in Crumstown, a town near South Bend. The line moved into South Bend at exactly 4:05 P.M., producing 89\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) winds at the airport. The tornado that hit Crumstown later hit Niles in Berrien County, then moved east-northeast into Cass County and dissipated in northwestern Saint Joseph County, Michigan. Two people were injured by the Crumstown tornado, and one man later died of his injuries. The storms prompted tornado warnings in Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties, and skies reportedly turned very green as the storms approached. The storms caused major damage to the Schoolcraft area of Kalamazoo County, where straight line winds in excess of 120 miles per hour were reported, causing a golf dome to blow away, ripping the roof off a house, ripping the front wall of a brick house off and twisting irrigation sprinkler systems. Strong winds were also reported in the City of Kalamazoo. In Calhoun County, strong straight line winds also struck near Tekonsha, causing damage. Other weaker tornadoes touched down in Mishawaka and moved northeast into Elkhart County. In Elkhart County, one of two separate tornadoes hit a Toll Road Maintenance Building and the other briefly touched down in the Cobus Green Trailer Court to the south-doing some damage to a few trailers. Another tornado damaged a trailer and a house in Marshall County and moved east into Kosciusko County and dissipated in Noble County. This particular tornado was photographed by meteorologists as it came near their forecast office in North Webster. Prior to the photo being taken, the tornado hit a factory on the north side of Warsaw, Indiana. Later in the evening the severe storm produced straight line winds through the campus of Michigan State University downing many trees and damaging buildings. The National Weather Service estimates most of the downbursts through East Lansing were between 60-80\u00a0mph, with one reaching 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). The supercell that passed through East Lansing also spawned two tornadoes in the Saginaw area. By 5:30\u00a0p.m., the severe weather moved out of Indiana and into Ohio where damage was not as severe. One tornado was reported in Ohio, an F3 tornado that moved from Paulding County into Putnam County. That tornado caused major structural damage to buildings near Fort Jennings, Ohio.[56] The severity of the activity began to wane later that evening. By 7:30 P.M., all severe weather watches were discontinued."

At approximately 07:30 GMT, a small band of thunderstorms initialised over Cornwall moving east-northeast across the country. By approximately 10:00\u00a0am, the squall line had reached Salisbury, where a drop in humidity was recorded, which may have resulted in an increase of atmospheric pressure behind the squall, causing it to accelerate forward. This increased motion in combination with a change in wind direction ahead of the storm may have initialised the rotation of the mesocyclone in one of the now strong storm cells, resulting in the touchdown of the T5 tornado in Kensal Rise, London, at 11\u00a0am.[2]"

Although the fires burned many different regions of California in August, the month was especially notable for several very large fires which burned in Southern California, despite being outside of the normal fire season for that region. The Station Fire, north of Los Angeles, was the largest and deadliest of these wildfires. It began in late August, and resulted in the devastation of 160,577 acres (251\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 650\u00a0km2) of land as well as the death of two firefighters. Another large fire was the La Brea Fire, which burned nearly 90,000 acres (141\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 364\u00a0km2) in Santa Barbara County earlier in the month. A state of emergency was also declared for the 7,800-acre (12\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 32\u00a0km2) Lockheed Fire in Santa Cruz County, to the north."

However, temperatures throughout the southern part of the state exceeded 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) for much of late August. The combination of high temperatures, low humidity and a large quantity of tinder-dry fuel, some of which had not burnt for decades, allowed some of the normal fires to quickly explode out of control despite the lack of winds to spread the flames. These conditions, along with extreme terrain in many undeveloped areas that slowed access to burn areas, made firefighting difficult."

The code states that anyone performing work that could spark a fire must have a shovel or fire extinguisher on hand.[8] The two were each sentenced to 250 hours of community service, three years probation and a $490 fine.[8]  Illenstine and Larsen were not charged with starting the fire - only a charge from a California Fire Code entitled \"Welding and other Hot Work\" and local civil attorney Kathy Johnson states the statue was not intended to be applied to brush clearing work.[7] A year later, in July 2011, 60 of the owners of homes destroyed by the fire filed a civil lawsuit against Stihl Incorporated, the manufacturer of the brush-cutting equipment, alleging that Stihl failed to warn users that the metal blades of the cutter could emit sparks capable of starting a fire in a high-risk area.

Once the private property was protected, the fire's growth in the wilderness began to stall, and the containment crew executed a direct attack plan.  Helicopters dropped water on the fire, heavy air tankers dropped fire retardant, and hotshot crews operated on the ground. Mechanized equipment was used to cut down enough trees in the area to make places that helicopters could land. After two weeks of managing the fire this way, the fire was declared 100% contained at 6\u00a0pm on August 22, and management of the contained fire was passed off from California Interagency Management Team 3 to Central Coast Interagency Incident Management Team 7, headed by Incident Commander Jim Smith.[3] At least 29 engines, 17 crews, 4 bulldozers, 56 water tenders, 5 aerial firefighting helicopters and 878 firefighters were deployed to fight the blaze.[1] The total cost of the firefighting effort amounted to $34.9 million.[5]:\u200a18"

The illegal drug operation was believed to be run by a Mexican National Drug Organization.[6] The illegal marijuana garden where the illegal drug operation was conducted was left unburned by the La Brea Fire, and there were signs of it being occupied shortly before the fire started. Officials were able to find and secure this camp area, and believed that the culprits were still in the San Rafael Wilderness attempting to escape on foot. As they feared the criminals were nearby, the police warned local citizens not to approach suspicious looking individuals, but instead report them to law enforcement.[7]"

The story recasts the X-Men, including the recently deceased Jean Grey, in the roles of fairy tale characters. One such character was a black dragon named \"Lockheed\",[2] who was based on the X-Men's modified Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird jet aircraft. Not long afterward, the X-Men are captured by the alien race, the Brood, and taken to a Brood-colonized planet. Here, Kitty meets a purple dragon who resembles the creature from her fairy tale, which she also names \"Lockheed\".[3] Lockheed is actually a member of an advanced dragon-like alien race whose society is similar to insect hives. Lockheed had been celebrated by his people as a brave fighter and hero against the Brood, but had demonstrated individual attitudes and wishes which were realized only when he encountered the X-Men. Lockheed saves Kitty from the Brood, and then secretly departs along with her.[3] She, as well as Professor X and her teammates, are unaware of his presence in the X-Mansion until he again saves Kitty's life from a nest of alien Sidrian hunter hatchlings.[4] The X-Men accept his presence,[5] and Lockheed has since become Kitty's longtime companion. To a lesser degree, Lockheed also bonds with Illyana Rasputin,[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] who, after being abducted into the dimension of Limbo (also known as Otherplace) by the sorcerer Belasco, had aged into a teenager, manifested her own mutant powers, and been installed as Kitty's roommate.  Lockheed occasionally accompanies Illyana after she joins the X-Men's \"junior team\", the New Mutants, including an adventure where the two encounter Brood-controlled clones of the X-Men.[6]"

She seemingly vanished from existence when Lockheed rejected her,[7] though she eventually resurfaced.

        "content": "In addition to serving with the X-Men alongside Kitty, he joins her when she co-founds the British superhero team Excalibur.[9] There he would form a friendship with Widget. Lockheed participates in the so-called Cross-Time Caper, which involves him and his teammates leaping through dimensions on a train. The train itself is from an alternate universe, and it is discovered that its power source is an alternate version of Lockheed himself. The two Lockheeds become good friends, although the other Lockheed desires to stay on the train. Lockheed travels with the team (and their ally, Alistaire Stuart) on several adventures throughout multiple realities. The team also encounters a humanoid version of Lockheed. He and a female Nightcrawler analogue together adopt the identity of Captain Britain, protecting the citizens of a magic-heavy planet. Near the end of the Caper, Lockheed and the team believe Kitty to be lost in the dimensions; in reality she had been transported home far earlier than the rest of the group. The intervention of Saturnyne allows the team to return home.[10] Eventually, Lockheed's decision to leave with Kitty and the X-Men comes back to haunt him. By leaving so unexpectedly, he had abandoned his fianc\u00e9e, whom he had been due to wed the following day. While healing from injuries gained from fighting Doctor Doom,[11] his astral form is apprehended by the Flock and made to stand trial for treason. After managing to explain his motives and saving his fellows from a piloting accident, he is officially exiled from his race, but on amicable terms.[12] Lockheed's affections for Kitty earn him the ire of interdimensional entities called Bamfs, characters from the fairy tale Kitty once told Illyana. Like Lockheed, these were real as well. These small versions of Nightcrawler also love Kitty, in their own way. At one point, jealous of Lockheed's relationship with Kitty, they invade the tunnels under Muir Island and hold him prisoner for some time. Lockheed's penchant for hiding after Kitty moves did not help his situation, as Kitty simply thought he was again being difficult.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] Lockheed develops a severe distaste for the secret agent Pete Wisdom, Kitty's love interest. Lockheed demonstrates that he has the ability to speak, but only talks to Wisdom, telling him that he \"hates him\". Wisdom tells Kitty about this, but she believes he is only joking, and he suffers the frequent theft of his clothing and cigarettes. Even so, Lockheed does save Wisdom's life at one point, although he tells the Londoner \"I still 'ate yoo\". It appears that one reason Lockheed dislikes Wisdom so much is that he much prefers Kitty's previous boyfriend, Colossus. This is demonstrated at the wedding of Captain Britain and Meggan, when Lockheed attempts to help them reconnect by snatching the bride's garter and dropping it into Piotr's hands just after Kitty had won Meggan's bouquet.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] Later, after Kitty left Excalibur and the X-Men entirely, it is believed that Lockheed had died. In reality, Lockheed had been found, wounded and confused, by a pair of girls who practiced witchcraft. He bonds with them until he discovers that the girls use their abilities to terrorize the local populace. The duo were soon humiliated in battle by their rival, another young girl with powers. This new friend heals Lockheed and directs him back to Kitty.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed]"

Kitty is assigned with the team appointed to stop the missile, while Lockheed is forced to remain behind. The two share a final lingering look before Kitty leaves. It is revealed that the missile is actually a giant bullet, and Kitty becomes trapped in it phasing it through the Earth. While grieving over Kitty, Lockheed drinks heavily to help with the pain. Eventually Abigail Brand reveals that Kitty is still alive within the bullet but they can't get her out yet. Lockheed then approaches a villain named Unit for help, but after learning that he would have to free Unit from prison changes his mind and leaves.[16] Kitty and Lockheed reunite in Astonishing X-Men (vol. 3) #38.

Nock-ten was the third typhoon to have caused significant impacts in the Philippines, after typhoons Sarika and Haima only two months prior, both of which struck similar areas at a similar intensity. 13 people were known to have been killed by Nock-ten. Damage totals were estimated upwards of US$127.5 million, and because of this, the names Nock-ten and Nina were retired by the Japan Meteorological Agency and PAGASA from their respective tropical cyclone name lists."

Later the same year, the first names of nominated recipients were submitted to the Royal Mint, and by early 1971 a total of 17 Police Meritorious Service Medals and 94 Police Long Service Medals, impressed on the edge with the recipient's details, had been sent and distributed. In addition, four ribbon clasps were supplied to reflect further police service. These were the only medals supplied.[5] In April 1971 Sierra Leone became a republic and the awarding of these medals was discontinued, no awards having been made for the police gallantry medal, or for any of the fire service medals.[5]"

The twenty-seventh named storm and the eighteenth typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Melor killed 51 people and caused \u20b17.04 billion (US$148.3 million) in damage. The typhoon began developing on December 7 as a low-pressure area 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) of Chuuk. Soon, it intensified into a tropical depression on December 10, and then into a tropical storm south of Yap, and was named Melor. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAG-ASA) initially decided to name Melor as \"Nonoy\", but due to political reasons, it was named \"Nona\" instead. On December 13, Tropical Storm Melor (Nona) became a typhoon, and made its first landfall on Northern Samar. The typhoon made several landfalls in Sorsogon, Burias Island, Romblon, and Oriental Mindoro, before weakening into a tropical storm. It turned southward on entering the South China Sea before weakening into a tropical depression and dissipating in the Sulu Sea."

        "content": "During December 10, the Japan Meteorological Agency started to monitor a tropical depression, that had developed about 665\u00a0km (415\u00a0mi) to the south of Guam.[1][2] The system was located within a favorable environment for further development, with low vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures of between 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F).[2]\nMoreover, the JMA started to issue tropical cyclone warnings to the system on the same day, expecting a tropical storm within 24 hours.[3] Based on a developing low-level circulation center (LLCC) obscured by the mid-level deep convection in an area of strong westward upper-level diffluence and moderate easterly vertical wind shear, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) to the system early on December 11.[4] The JMA, however, upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm immediately after issuing that TCFA and named it Melor, when the storm was only about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) south of Yap.[5] In the afternoon, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression and designated it as 28W, just six hours before the center upgraded Melor to a tropical storm that was tracking west-northwestward along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge.[6] The PAGASA was about to name the tropical storm as Nonoy, yet it was named Nona after entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility on December 12, owing to political reasons.[7] When Melor was forming an eye in the afternoon, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm.[8][9] Due to low vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures above 28\u00b0C and robust poleward outflow enhanced by a very powerful Aleutian low, Melor intensified into a typhoon early on December 13, as tightly curved spiral banding was observed wrapping into a tiny but clear eye.[10][11] The JTWC upgraded Melor to a SSHWS Category 4-equivalent typhoon at noon. Although the eye appeared to be cloud-filled temporarily, the eyewall consolidated further.[12][13] Melor made landfall over Batag Island of Laoang, Northern Samar of the Philippines at 11:00 PST (03:00 UTC) on December 14. The JMA reported a peak intensity of ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 935\u00a0hPa (27.61\u00a0inHg). The typhoon formed a well-defined eye and then maintained it for several hours while crossing the northern coast of Samar.[14][15] Later, it made its second landfall over Bulusan, Sorsogon at 16:00 PST (08:00 UTC) and third landfall over Burias Island at 21:45 PST (13:45 UTC), resulting in a cloud-filled eye again.[16] Shortly after Melor made its fourth landfall over Banton Island, Romblon at 05:30 PST on December 15 (21:30 UTC on December 14), the typhoon significantly intensified again with a distinct 25-km (15-mile) eye and a compact core. Right before making its fifth landfall on Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro at 10:30 PST (02:30 UTC), the JTWC indicated that Melor had reached peak intensity with one-minute maximum sustained winds at 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), just shy of the super typhoon status.[17][18] Shortly after the typhoon made its final landfall, its eye rapidly became cloud-filled. Inflow along the southwestern quadrant was forced over the mountainous central terrain of Mindoro, and strong poleward outflow was also weakening owing to the decreasing linkage to mid-latitude flow.[19] Emerging into the South China Sea and moving northwestward in the afternoon, Melor started to encounter strong vertical wind shear as well as strong northeasterly low-level flow associated with a developing cold surge.[20] Melor was downgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA and a tropical storm by the JTWC early on December 16 when the upper-level environment was deteriorating and causing the system to disintegrate, leading to the steering influence shifting to the low-level flow.[21][22] Thus, the quickly weakening storm made a U-turn and moved southward. The JMA downgraded Melor to a tropical storm at noon, although the system's convection had been sheared away from the low-level circulation center.[23][24] Several of meteorological agencies downgraded Melor to a tropical depression early on December 17, including the JMA and JTWC, who issued final warnings on the system;[25] however, satellite imageries depicted an open trough instead of a discernable LLCC.[26] The system completely dissipated in the Sulu Sea before noon.[27][28]"

Because all sewers in Nicaragua were damaged, the water was contaminated.[6] Ninety percent of the banana crop and 60\u00a0percent of the corn crop was completely destroyed.[1] Throughout the country, 108 people were killed,[3] (10 of which drowned in floodwaters).[4] Roughly 20,000\u00a0people were homeless[1] and total damage was estimated at $365\u00a0million (1982\u00a0USD);[7] damage to highways, factories, and farms exceeded $100 million.[3] In the northern portion of the country, a mudslide buried three small mountain villages, leaving 270\u00a0missing and only 29\u00a0survivors.[8] About 15,000 sought to two emergency shelters.

Soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries.[10] A second appeal was made shortly afterwards, which proposed for $5.1\u00a0million in medicine and other supplies.[11] The red cross and United Nations (UN) appealed for $3\u00a0million in international relief.[12] The UN granted Nicaragua a month's worth of food supply, but officials feared that this would not be enough.[6] The government of Cuba announced that they would send 12,000 construction workers as well as 2,000 teachers, doctors, and officials to Nicaragua.[13] Canada donated $220,000\u00a0via the League of Red Cross Societies.[1] To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program to give out vaccines which costs $5.1\u00a0million.[3] The U.S. Embassy in Managua provided $25,000\u00a0in donations.

        "content": "On the morning of August 16, thunderstorms moved across Oregon, starting multiple fires, including the Beachie Creek Fire, the Lionshead Fire, and the P-515 Fire. The Lionshead and P-515 Fires were ignited in the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, near Mount Jefferson, while the Beachie Creek Fire was ignited near Opal Creek, to the west of the other two fires. Initially, the three fires were unremarkable, being relatively small wildfires that smoldered in the rugged terrain of the Opal Creek and Mount Jefferson Wildernesses, within the Willamette National Forest. However, the fires gradually grew in size, since firefighters opted to use only indirect methods and water drops to fight the fires, due to the dangers of directly fighting the fires in the steep, mountainous terrain.[6] State authorities closed off portions of the national forest where the fires were burning, in an attempt to keep the fires boxed in. Fire officials noted the potential for the fires to become active and explosively spread under the right conditions, despite their small size at the time.[6] On September 7, powerful east winds blew across Oregon and the Pacific Northwest, reaching speeds over 50 miles per hour (80\u00a0km/h), causing the fires to explode in size as they raced westward, with the Lionshead Fire burning down portions of Idanha.[6] The winds also blew down power lines around Santiam Canyon, sparking 13 spot fires between Detroit and Mehama, which quickly grew into a large blaze that merged with the Beachie Creek Fire within hours.[6][12] Due to the rapid spread of the Santiam and Beachie Creek Fires, and the imminent threat they posed to communities to the west, including areas as far west as Salem, mass evacuations were ordered in Marion County. The evacuation orders were suddenly issued near midnight on Tuesday, September 8, sowing plenty of confusion and chaos in the ensuing evacuations.[13] Early on September 8, the Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fires merged, probably at a point north of Detroit. The merger created a 313,110-acre (126,710\u00a0ha) complex fire, which was referred to as the Santiam Fire,[6][8][7] with the name reflecting the fact that the spot fires ignited around Santiam Canyon had been responsible for most of the Beachie Creek Fire's explosive growth.[12] On September 9, the Santiam Fire quickly moved into and destroyed the city of Detroit as it continued its westward spread.[10][14] Soon afterward, the Santiam Fire destroyed the city of Gates, and burned into Mill City and parts of Lyons during its westward spread, also threatening the cities of Sublimity, Stayton, and Salem.[9][15] On September 10, incident command renamed the main component fires to Beachie Creek Fire and Lionshead Fire.[7][16] On the same day, officials feared that the Santiam Fire would merge with the 120,000-acre (49,000\u00a0ha) Riverside Fire to the north, which would create an even bigger fire that would pose a much greater threat to the communities near Salem and Portland, while complicating efforts to contain the fires.[8][17] However, this fear subsided somewhat on the next day, as firefighters made progress on containing both the Santiam and Riverside Fires, with improved weather conditions.[17] On September 11, the P-515 Fire merged into the eastern portion of the Lionshead Fire, increasing the size of the Santiam Fire to 322,573 acres (130,541\u00a0ha).[7] During the following week, the onshore flow returned, causing the Lionshead Fire to begin spreading eastward. On September 23, the Santiam Fire exceeded 400,000 acres (160,000\u00a0ha) in size. On December 10, 2020, the entire complex fire was fully contained."

Over two hundred fires were ablaze across British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.[1] Tens of thousand of people had been evacuated and more than 1,900,000 hectares (4,700,000 acres) of forest had burned.[2] Fire-fighters from Mexico,[3] Western Australia,[2] and New Zealand were sent to assist.[3] The Canadian military also fought the fires.[4] Since the smoke was so dense, warnings had been given across central and Western Canada; additionally, parts of the western United States were also issued air advisories because of the amount of smoke. Wildfires have burned one million hectares (2.4 million acres) in Saskatchewan in the past year according to statistics posted on the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.[5] The words people have used to describe this natural disaster is \"extreme, unprecedented, and historic.\" A majority of the ecosystem where the fire had been burning consists of boreal forests. Circumstances for catastrophic fires were created as a result of the fuel buildup starting in the 1950s caused fire inhibition. This outcome created a change in the landscape-age mosaic. Initially, this fuel buildup was created for closed canopy ecosystems such as the Pinus ponderosa located in the western United States.[6]"

Forests are their main work and food source, and are also important from a cultural standpoint.[20][21] The province with the highest number of evacuees for 2015 season was Saskatchewan, including communities of La Ronge, Air Ronge and the Lac La Ronge Indian band where fires forced 13,000 people to leave their homes \u2013 making it the largest evacuation in the Saskatchewan history.[17] In British Columbia,  1,144 homes were evacuated (approximately 3,432 individuals), and over 50 structures were destroyed, the highest number since 2003, throughout the province, with major losses at Puntzi Lake and Rock Creek  during 2015 wildfire season.[22][23][24] Wildfires also resulted in road closures which negatively impacted the oilsands, conventional oil, and gas industry in Alberta.

        "content": " Typhoon Meranti, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Ferdie, was one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record. Impacting the Batanes in the Philippines, Taiwan, as well as Fujian Province in September 2016, Meranti formed as a tropical depression on September 8 near the island of Guam. Tracking to the west northwest, Meranti gradually intensified until September 11, at which point it began a period of rapid intensification. Continuing to rapidly intensify, it became a super typhoon early on September 12, as it passed through the Luzon Strait, ultimately reaching its peak intensity on September 13 with 1-minute sustained winds of 315\u00a0km/h (195\u00a0mph). Shortly afterwards, it passed directly over the island of Itbayat. Meranti passed to the south of Taiwan as a super typhoon, and began weakening steadily as a result of land interaction. By September 15, it struck Fujian Province as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, becoming the strongest typhoon on record to impact the province. Upon moving inland, rapid weakening ensued and Meranti became extratropical the next day, dissipating shortly afterwards after it passed to the south of the Korean Peninsula. The island of Itbayat sustained a direct hit from the super typhoon near its peak intensity, severing communications from the island for several days. However, no fatalities were reported on the island. The typhoon caused \u20b1244.99\u00a0million (US$5.16\u00a0million) in damage on the island. However, the most costly and direct impacts were felt in eastern China, where 45 people were killed from floods. Total economic cost in China reached \u00a531.78\u00a0billion (US$4.76\u00a0billion). In total, Meranti caused US$4.79\u00a0billion in damage and killed 47 people. During its lifetime, Meranti broke or tied several meteorological records. With JTWC-estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 315\u00a0km/h (195\u00a0mph), Meranti is tied with Haiyan in 2013, Goni in 2020 and Surigae in 2021 as the strongest typhoon on record by wind speed. Additionally, in terms of 1-minute sustained winds, the storm's landfall on the island of Itbayat shortly after peak intensity ties it with Haiyan as the second strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record, only behind Goni. The estimated pressure of 890\u00a0mbar (26\u00a0inHg) was also the lowest on record in the Western Pacific since Megi in 2010."

        "content": "On September\u00a08, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 1] issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for an area of convection about 155\u00a0km (96\u00a0mi) west of Guam in the western Pacific Ocean. According to the agency, the circulation was rapidly consolidating alongside fragmented rainbands.[2] At 18:00\u00a0UTC that night, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] classified the system as a tropical depression.[4] On the next day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Depression 16W. By that time, the nascent system was moving slowly west-northwestward through a region of low wind shear, steered by ridges to the north and southwest. Increasing but fragmented convection, or thunderstorms, was fueled by unusually warm water temperatures and outflow from the south.[5] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Meranti,[6] which meandered over its own track while consolidating.[7] Northerly wind shear shifted the deepest convection to the south of Meranti's circulation,[8] although rainbands and a central dense overcast continued to evolve as the wind shear decreased.[9] By early on September\u00a011, the storm's movement was steady to the west-northwest, south of the ridge.[10] At 06:00\u00a0UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Meranti to typhoon status,[11] and shortly thereafter the JTWC followed suit.[12] The storm's structure continued to improve, with increased outflow.[13] A small eye 9\u00a0km (5.6\u00a0mi) across developed within the spiraling thunderstorms, signaling that Meranti was rapidly intensifying.[14] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, the JTWC upgraded Meranti to a super typhoon, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph).[15] Six hours later, the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, while noting \"an extremely favorable environment\", and that the eye became even more symmetric within intense convection.[16] Outflow enhanced by a strong anticyclone over Meranti fueled the intensification,[17] and the typhoon peaked in intensity on September\u00a013 while passing through the Luzon Strait. The JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 890\u00a0hPa (mbar; 26.28\u00a0inHg),[18] while the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 315\u00a0km/h (195\u00a0mph).[19] Based on the JMA pressure estimate, Meranti was among the most intense tropical cyclones. The JTWC wind estimate made Meranti the strongest tropical cyclone by wind speed worldwide in 2016, surpassing Cyclone Winston, which had peak sustained winds of 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph) when it struck Fiji in February.[20] Late on September 13, the storm made landfall on the 83\u00a0km2 (32\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) island of Itbayat in the Philippine province of Batanes shortly after attaining its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 305\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph).[21][22] A weather station on the island measured 10-minute sustained winds of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a concurrent pressure of 933.6\u00a0mbar (27.57\u00a0inHg) around 17:00\u00a0UTC before being destroyed. Just south of Itbayat in Basco, sustained winds peaked at 144\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph), gusts reached 252\u00a0km/h (157\u00a0mph), and a minimum pressure of 935.4\u00a0mbar (27.62\u00a0inHg) was observed in the eyewall.[23] At around 03:15 CST on September 15 (19:15 UTC on September 14), Meranti slammed into the Xiang'an District, Xiamen, Fujian, with measured 2-minute sustained winds of 173\u00a0km/h (107\u00a0mph),[24] making it the second strongest typhoon ever to make landfall in Fujian Province.[25]"

Keele Jr. (34), who had 3,878 flight hours, with 235 of them on the DC-9.[1]:\u200a50\u200a The crew was advised of the presence of embedded thunderstorms and possible tornadoes along their general route prior to their departure from Huntsville, but they were not subsequently told that the cells had since formed a squall line.[5] The flight crew had flown through that same area from Atlanta earlier in the day, encountering only mild turbulence and light rain. The weather system had greatly intensified in the meantime. The peak convective activity was later shown on ground radar to be near Rome, Georgia, to which the flight was cleared to proceed by air traffic control. The crew attempted to pick out a path through the cells using their on-board weather radar display, but they were apparently misled by the radar's attenuation effect, and they proceeded toward what they believed was a low-intensity area, when in fact it was the peak convective activity point, attenuated by rain. As the aircraft descended from its cruising altitude of 17,000 to 14,000 feet (5,200 to 4,300\u00a0m) near Rome VOR, it apparently entered a thunderstorm cell and encountered a massive amount of rain and hail.[1]:\u200a31\u200a The hail was so intense that it broke the aircraft's windshield, and because of the ingestion of both water and hail, both Pratt & Whitney JT8D-7A engines were damaged and underwent flameout.[5][2] The crew attempted unsuccessfully to restart the engines, gliding down unpowered, while simultaneously trying to find an emergency landing field within range. Air traffic control suggested Dobbins Air Force Base, about 20 miles (17\u00a0nmi; 32\u00a0km) east, as a possible landing site, but it was beyond reach. Cartersville Airport, a general-aviation airport about 15 miles (13\u00a0nmi; 24\u00a0km) north with a much shorter runway intended for light aircraft was considered, but it was behind the aircraft and now out of reach. Before the aircraft turned toward Dobbins, the closest airport was another general-aviation airport, Cornelius Moore Airport (now Polk County Airport \u2013 Cornelius Moore Field), but the air traffic controllers did not know about it (it was just outside their area of responsibility and not shown on their screens), and it was not considered. As the aircraft ran out of altitude and options, gliding with a broken windshield and no engine power, the crew made visual contact with the ground and spotted a straight section of a rural highway below. They executed an unpowered forced landing on that road, but during the rollout, the aircraft\u2019s left wing collided with a gas station causing it to swerve to the left and crash into a wooded area. The pilots and 61 passengers were killed by impact forces and fire, but 20 of the passengers survived, as well as both flight attendants.

The loss of thrust was caused by the ingestion of massive amounts of water and hail which in combination with thrust lever movement induced severe stalling in and major damage to the engine compressors. The DC-9 broke into several large pieces; the cockpit had separated mostly intact and came to rest upside-down. Both pilots had been ejected from it, still strapped into their seats, and died of massive blunt-force injuries. The cockpit windows had separated and were mostly intact except for the two that had been struck by hail. No fire damage occurred to the fuselage until behind the wings, which area had been subjected to an intense conflagration, but most of the passenger section up to the wings had been demolished by impact forces. Some passengers were killed on impact, while others were ejected from the fuselage alive but injured. A number of other passengers succumbed to inhalation of smoke and fumes, including some who were unable to escape because of their injuries. Flight attendant Catherine Cooper survived unscathed because she was sitting in an area that provided her with relative protection from impact forces. She found herself hanging upside-down while still strapped into her seat, unbuckled the seatbelt, and jumped from an opening in the fuselage when the main cabin door turned out to be jammed and inoperable. Afterwards, Cooper ran to a nearby house to find help and discovered that some of the passengers were already there. Meanwhile, flight attendant Sandy Ward was seated in the back of the plane and reported it \"bouncing up and down\" several times during impact and that fire spread through the cabin. With a wall of flames blocking the way in front, she moved rearwards and tried to open the back cabin door, but it was also jammed. By now, the fire had died down and she was able to exit through the broken fuselage. Ward tried to assist passengers in escaping until an explosion forced her to run for cover. As per standard emergency procedure, the flight attendants removed their shoes and ordered passengers to do likewise. This policy was due to the possibility of high heels causing damage to evacuation slides.[6] This resulted in a number of people sustaining lacerations and bruises to their feet that would have been unlikely to have occurred otherwise, but since the attendants did not know the exact circumstances of the crash, they simply followed by-the-book emergency directions. The NTSB believed that the pilots should have informed the flight attendants and crew to cushion themselves with blankets, coats, and pillows, and not remove their shoes. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data indicated at least two interruptions to power, one lasting for 15 seconds and the other almost 2 minutes following the complete loss of engine thrust until the crew switched to backup battery power. The best chance for a (reasonably) safe landing would have been at Dobbins Air Force Base in Marietta, Georgia,[1]:\u200a33\u200a but why the crew did not attempt it is unclear because of the two-minute gap in CVR data.[1]:\u200a33\u200a Lacking CVR data, the NTSB concluded that it was most likely that the pilots turned away from Dobbins for a combination of poor visibility and loss of electrical power, forcing the crew to turn the plane so they could maintain visual flight conditions.[1]:\u200a33 The NTSB also included these contributing factors: the failure of the company's dispatching system to provide the flight crew with up-to-date severe weather information pertaining to the aircraft's intended route of flight, the captain's reliance on airborne weather radar for penetration of thunderstorm areas, and limitations in the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic control system, which precluded the timely dissemination of real-time hazardous weather information to the flight crew. Moreover, the crew had no training for a situation that involved total loss of engine thrust, nor did Southern Airways require such training.[1]:\u200a33\u200a FAA regulations had no such requirement either, because the possibility of complete failure of all engines on a jet-powered carrier aircraft was deemed so remote as to not require training or special procedures; the NTSB could not find a recorded instance prior to Flight 242 of a commercial jet aircraft experiencing such an emergency.[1]:\u200a33\u200a  (While other significant incidents involving loss of all engines in flight have occurred, including the Gimli Glider, Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751, and the Miracle on the Hudson, these happened after Flight 242's unpowered landing event in 1977.)"

Kay Bailey, who signed the final report, added a concurring statement, which reiterated the board's previous recommendations for improved real-time weather dissemination.[1]:\u200a46\u200a Francis H. McAdams, one of the four NTSB members, dissented from the other members.  In his dissenting opinion, McAdams provided his alternate view of the probable cause:[1]:\u200a48 the probable cause of this accident was the captain's decision to penetrate rather than avoid an area of severe weather, the failure to obtain all the available weather information despite having knowledge of the severity of the storm system, and the reliance upon airborne weather radar for penetration rather than avoidance of the storm system. The penetration resulted in a total loss of thrust from both engines due to the ingestion of massive amounts of water and hail, which in combination with advanced throttle settings, induced severe stalling in, and major damage to, the engine compressors, which prevented the crew from restarting the engines. Furthermore, if the company's dispatching system had provided the flight crew with timely severe weather information pertaining to the aircraft's intended route of flight, it is possible that the severe weather would not have been penetrated. McAdams also wrote in his dissent that he would add, as a contributing factor, the \"inadequacies of the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic control system, which precluded the dissemination of real-time hazardous weather information to the flight crew.\"[1]:\u200a48"

The NTSB noted in its report that despite the fact that the flight crew did not communicate with the cabin crew during the emergency sequence, the flight attendants on their own initiative briefed and prepared the passengers for an emergency landing as the plane glided down. Just prior to touchdown, with no prior notice or cue from the flight crew that the plane was about to crash land, the flight attendants \"saw trees\" in the windows, and immediately yelled to the passengers a final \"brace for impact!\" command. The flight attendants also helped evacuate the passengers from the burning plane after the crash landing. The NTSB concluded: The flight attendants acted commendably for initiating a comprehensive emergency briefing of the passengers for their protection in preparation for a crash landing. This contributed to the number of survivors.[1]:\u200a41 Purl wrote the book Am I Alive? about the experience, and is a motivational speaker. In her book, she tells the story of the crash and the history of critical incident stress management's entry into the aviation industry.[8] Purl retired from Northwest in 1994."

In addition, the NTSB report includes a depiction of the accident site, hand-drawn as a circled \"X\" on an aviation sectional chart. Highway designations had been changed as of 2006. The road section used for the forced landing, formerly called Georgia State Route 92 Spur, is now called Dallas\u2013Acworth Highway (formerly Georgia State Route 381).[9] The small Georgia community of New Hope, in Paulding County, where a memorial and reunion were held by survivors and family members 20 years after the accident in 1997,[10][11] now hosts a memorial and reunion annually near the crash site.[12][13] The site is 11 miles (18\u00a0km) from Cartersville Airport and 15.5 miles (25\u00a0km) from Dobbins AFB. Cornelius Moore Field, between Cedartown and Rockmart, was about 20.5 miles (33\u00a0km) behind them at the time of the crash. Local residents and victims' families formed the nonprofit New Hope Memorial Flight 242, Inc., to provide \"an annual memorial service, survivor's reunion and a monument.\"[14][15] New Hope Memorial installed a Georgia state historical marker at the southwest corner of the New Hope Cemetery, located about a half mile southwest of the crash site.[13][16] The text of the marker states: April 4, 1977 The Worst Aircraft Disaster in Georgia HistoryOn April 4, 1977, a DC-9 Southern Airways Flight 242 flying from Huntsville, AL, to Atlanta encountered a dangerous thunderstorm over Rome, GA. The hail and rain the aircraft endured was so severe that both engines flamed out and the aircraft quickly lost altitude. The flight crew desperately attempted to land the DC-9 on GA 92 Spur, now known as GA 381, which runs through the community of New Hope. The result was the worst aircraft disaster in GA history, claiming 72 lives including 9 local residents of New Hope. Miraculously, 22 passengers survived. New Hope resident fatalities included Kathy Griffin Carter and son Jeffrey Richard Carter, Faye Robinson Griffin and son Larry Allen Griffin, Edna Griffin Gamel, son John T. Gamel and daughter Courtney A. Gamel, Berlie Mae Bell Cranton, and Ernest L. Prewett. In March 2015, the organization announced plans to build a permanent memorial to honor the victims of the crash.[13][16][17] In March 2019, the group announced that sufficient funds had been raised for a larger memorial.[18]  On April 4, 2021, the memorial was dedicated on the tragedy's 44th anniversary with nearly 100 in attendance including survivors and family members spanning four states.

Some rivers overflowed in Romagna, causing widespread damage in the plains and killing two people.[13] On 12 May, the Metropolitan City of Bologna was hit by a cloudburst, which caused minor floods.[14][15] The long-time effects of the drought and the persistent bad weather prevented the soil from draining; by 16 May, another storm\u2014known as Storm Minerva\u2014hit the region with uninterrupted heavy rain for almost two days. Twenty-three rivers across the region burst their banks. Fifteen people were killed during the floods;[16][17] seven people died between Cesena and Forl\u00ec, seven died in Ravenna, and another one in San Lazzaro di Savena, near Bologna.[18][19][20] Damages also occurred in the Apennine areas, with more than 400 landslides counted across the four Italian provinces.[21] More than 50,000 people were displaced,[22][23] with more than 4,800 of them finding temporary shelter in hotels and gyms indicated by local administrations.[24] While the storm ended in the afternoon of 17 May,[25] other floods occurred on the following days. Notably, the town of Lugo, near Ravenna, was completely flooded on the morning of 18 May,[24][26] while Russi, in the same area, was evacuated on 19 May due to the overflow of the Emilia-Romagna Channel.[27][28] On 19 May, rain started to fall again.[29] On 20 May, alert remained high in the territory of Ravenna, where 36,000 people were evacuated.[30][31] On 26 May, the town of Conselice, in the province of Ravenna, was evacuated for health reasons, since the stagnant water that was still flooding large areas of the town was full of waste and garbage, and so could have become a vector for either viral or bacterial infections.[32][33][34] On 27 May, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane officially announced that access to the rail line between Bologna and Rimini, as well as the one between Faenza and Ravenna, would be fully restored from 29 May onwards, whilst the Ferrara\u2013Ravenna\u2013Rimini route would be completely re-activated on 30 May;[35][36] all of the aforementioned lines stayed subject to variations and delays, since the standard number and top speed of vehicles available were set to be restored gradually.[35][36]"

He wrote: \"Heart and commitment dedicated to the citizens of Emilia-Romagna who are fighting against water and mud. An AC Milan without heart, grit and ideas does not even deserve a thought.\"[69][70][71] Salvini, who was set to be directly involved in the management of the emergency due to his political duties,[70] later deleted the tweet but was nonetheless heavily criticized for his apparent lack of taste and empathy.[69][70][71] The Democratic Party-led regional government was accused by several local members of right-wing parties, such as Brothers of Italy and Lega, of being directly responsible for the floods, allegedly due to poor maintenance of the rivers' banks.[72][73] During an interview on Rai Radio 1 on 18 May, Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, the Minister of the Environment, announced that the Italian government would activate the state of calamity for all of the areas damaged by the flooding from 23 May onwards.[23][24][74] The decision, which was set to receive an official approval by the Ministry of Agriculture, was aimed to help farm workers get easier access to indemnities and other economic measures.[23] In the same interview, Pichetto Fratin announced the activation with immediate effect of a national economic recovery package, which would suspend the payment of taxes and loan agreements for all the citizens and businesses affected by the floods;[23][24] he also previewed the introduction of a national plan of climate change adaptation, acknowledging the significant impact of climate change on the rising frequency of natural disasters in Italy and across the world.[23][74] On 20 May, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni officially annonuced that she would depart the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, early in order to return to Italy and help coordinate the emergency, stating that she \"could not remain so far from Italy in such a complex moment\".[75][76][77] While departing, Meloni thanked fellow G7 leaders for their offers of aid to the victims of the floods.[75] She landed in Rimini the following day,[77] and visited the provinces of Forl\u00ec and Ravenna, as well as the city of Faenza, before meeting regional president Stefano Bonaccini and Fabrizio Curcio, the head of Protezione Civile, at the Prefettura of Ravenna.[78][79] Bonaccini's request to be named extraordinary commissioner to manage the relief funds,[80] as was custom among regional presidents in Italy,[81][82] was opposed by the Meloni government, in particular by Brothers of Italy and Lega;[83][84] some regional presidents of the centre-right coalition, such as Roberto Occhiuto, Giovanni Toti, and Luca Zaia, sided with Bonaccini.[85] On 7 June, Meloni hosted a meeting with Bonaccini and other administrators from the affected areas, stating that the emergency would be temporarily managed by an operative table between the national government and local institutions led by Nello Musumeci, the Minister for Civil Protection and Maritime Policies.[82][86] On 23 May, Italy's Council of Ministers officially announced the approval of the first law decree\u00a0[it] in response to the emergency, an estimated \u20ac2.2 billion recovery package that was aimed to public and private businesses, schools, universities, museums, and farm workers, among other categories.[87][88][89] The law's final text was eventually published on the Gazzetta Ufficiale on 1 June,[90][91][92] and included an estimated \u20ac1.6 billion package, a lower budget than the one originally presented by the government.[91][92][93] A \u20ac620 million-worth recovery fund for workers affected by the disaster was the largest investment included in the package;[91][94] all of the measures were financed through cuts to other welfare systems, including the Salary Integration Fund, the Social Fund for Occupation and Formation, and the set-to-be-ceased citizens' income.[91][92][95] 24 May was declared as National Day of Mourning for the victims of the flooding, as both the Italian and European flags hung outside of the Chamber of Deputies in Rome were displayed at half-mast.[96] On 25 May, Meloni and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, visited the flooded areas along with Bonaccini.[97] Von der Leyen assured that the European Union (EU) would help the region, adding in Romagnol dialect, Tin bota (English: \"Stay strong\"), which was widely used as the slogan for the ongoing reconstruction process.[98] On 27 May, Italian President Sergio Mattarella publicly announced that he would visit the affected areas on 30 May.[99][100][101] Throughout his trip, where he was accompanied by Bonaccini, Mattarella visited the comune of Modigliana, before reaching Forl\u00ec, and then heading to Cesena, Lugo, Ravenna, and Faenza.[102][103] After weeks of tension within the government and between majority and opposition parties,[82][83][85] the Meloni cabinet officially appointed army corps general Francesco Paolo Figliuolo as Extraordinary Commissioner for the Reconstruction on 27 June 2023.[104][105][106] Figliuolo, who had previously served as Extraordinary Commissioner for the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy under the Draghi government between March 2021 and March 2022,[105][106] would retain his role for the following five years.[104] In the same instance, Bonaccini, Francesco Acquaroli, and Eugenio Giani, the regional presidents of Marche and Tuscany (the other two adjacent regions affected by the floods), were all nominated as Sub-Commissioners for the Reconstruction.[104][105] Bonaccini described the government's centralist choice as a wrong choice but said that he was ready to work together.[107] The same day of the Extraordinary Commissioner nomination, Musumeci announced that the Council of Ministers had approved a bill that aimed to simplify and standardize reconstruction plans for the territories affected by natural disasters, including floods, rockslides, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.[104][108] During the press conference where he presented the bill, Musumeci stated: \"If ten years ago I would have asked myself whether [what happened in Emilia-Romagna] would happen again, today I only ask myself 'when' [it will happen again], given climate change and the vulnerability of territories.\"[108]"

The wildfire was the costliest and most destructive wildfire in Texas history and among the costliest in U.S. history, destroying 1,696\u00a0structures and causing an estimated $350\u00a0million in insured property damage. An exceptional drought, accompanied by record-high temperatures, affected Texas for much of 2011. Vegetation consequently became severely parched throughout the state, and over the year an unprecedented amount of land in the state was burned by numerous wildfires. In early September\u00a02011, the presence of Tropical Storm Lee to the east produced strong northerly winds over the state, exacerbating the preexisting dry weather to produce critical fire conditions. On the afternoon of September\u00a04, 2011, three separate fires ignited in the wildland\u2013urban interface east of Bastrop, Texas, after strong winds caused by the nearby tropical storm snapped trees onto power lines. Within 48\u00a0hours, the fires merged into one blaze that quickly consumed parts of Bastrop State Park and parts of the Lost Pines Forest, as well as homes in nearby subdivisions. Most of the conflagration's spread and destruction occurred within a week of ignition, as the forward advance of the wildfire mostly stopped after September\u00a07. The wildfire was largely contained in September, though the firebreak was briefly breached in early October. On October\u00a010, the Bastrop County Complex was declared controlled, and the fire was declared extinguished on October\u00a029 after 55\u00a0days of burning within the fire perimeter. Two people were killed by the wildfire, and another twelve people were injured. The fire perimeter encircled an area spanning at least 32,000\u00a0acres (12,950\u00a0hectares). Homes were destroyed in ten subdivisions, of which Circle-D County Acres and Tahitian Village sustained the most significant property damage. The wildfire destroyed more homes than any single fire in Texas history by nearly a factor of ten. Around 96\u00a0percent of Bastrop State Park was scorched by the wildfire. Roughly 1.5\u00a0million trees across 16,200\u00a0acres (6,600\u00a0hectares) of forest  were either killed directly by the fire or fatally damaged. Despite the severe habitat loss, populations of local herpetofauna were not significantly affected by the fire, though extensive soil erosion was enabled by the loss of groundcover."

        "content": "The Bastrop County complex occurred within the Lost Pines Forest of Texas, a region characterized by a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) canopy, a yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) understory, sandy soils, and a mixed topography of flat terrain and rolling hills.[2] This area is near the city of Bastrop, Texas, which itself is located about 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) southeast of Austin, the state capital of Texas.[3] Oak trees, Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), shrubs, and grasses also comprise the vegetation of the region. The Lost Pines cover a 70\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (180\u00a0km2) area and are a disjunct population separated from the Piney Woods by 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) of agricultural land.[2][4] Historical wildfire behavior in Texas has been strongly influenced by human activities and changes in land use, affecting the makeup and composition of the vegetation impacted by the fire. The prevalence of cattle in Bastrop County between the 1860s and mid-1880s may have led to a reduction in fires in and around what is now Bastrop State Park via the grazing of potential fuels. However, the harsh winter of 1886\u20131887 brought an end to open-range grazing by 1890; this may have allowed for an increase in wildfires in subsequent decades. Greater utilization of wildfire suppression after the mid-1940s led to an increase in tree density in the region, further augmented by the concurrent planting of additional loblolly pine trees. The reduction in wildfires after the 1940s\u00a0\u2013 leading to the lowest fire activity since at least 1720\u00a0\u2013 led to a build-up in vegetation density (and thus potential fuels for a wildfire) to unprecedented levels.[5] In the years leading up to the Bastrop County Complex, the only large wildfire in the area was the Wilderness Ridge Fire in 2009, which burned 1,491\u00a0acres (603\u00a0hectares).[6] The vegetation in and around Bastrop State Park indicates that no fire before 2011, dating back to at least 1650, matched the severity of the Bastrop County Complex.[5] Texas endured one of its worst droughts in recorded history throughout much of 2011. The drought began to materialize following a drier than average autumn and winter beginning in 2010, but it worsened to widespread and extreme levels after March\u00a02011. The average precipitation total statewide was 0.29\u00a0in (7.4\u00a0mm) compared to the 1981\u20132010 average of 2.18\u00a0in (55\u00a0mm) in March, making it the state's driest March on record. The period from October\u00a02010 to September\u00a02011 was the driest 12-month period in Texas history, with the statewide average rainfall falling below the previous record set during the 1950s Texas drought by 2.35\u00a0in (60\u00a0mm).[7] Based on paleoclimate reconstructions, the summer of 2011 may have been the fourth driest summer in Texas since 996.[5] Temperatures during the summer of 2011 also rose to record highs, with statewide average temperatures from June through August\u00a02011 eclipsing the previous record high by 2\u00a0\u00b0F; each of the three months was their respective warmest month on record.[7] Additionally, the mean statewide temperature in those three months were the hottest summer months recorded in any U.S. state on record, topping the record heat set in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl.[8][9] Dry conditions perpetuated by the drought led to widespread die-offs of trees across central and eastern Texas by the early fall of 2011, and most forests throughout the state were exceptionally dry;[7] 251 of the 254\u00a0counties in Texas had bans on outdoor burning in effect in September\u00a02011.[3] The moisture content of all vegetation types within Bastrop County diminished to record lows during the course of the drought, making them increasingly susceptible to combustion.[2] According to the U.S. Drought Monitor,[a] the entirety of Bastrop County had remained in exceptional drought\u00a0\u2013 the most severe drought conditions\u00a0\u2013 since the week of May\u00a010, 2011, and had been experiencing at least abnormally dry conditions since at least the week of October 26, 2010.[11] Numerous wildfires occurred across Texas and adjoining states in 2011; more land area was burned in Texas and Oklahoma since official recordkeeping began in 2002.[5] Between November\u00a02010 and September\u00a02011, Texas wildfires engulfed over 3.7\u00a0million acres (1.5\u00a0million hectares) of land; within the first week of September\u00a02011, 135,000\u00a0acres (54,600\u00a0hectares) burned.[3] Amid the exceptional drought in early September\u00a02011, Tropical Storm Lee developed in the Gulf of Mexico and produced northeasterly winds across much of East Texas beginning on September\u00a03; the storm itself was centered over the gulf south of the central Louisiana coast.[2] These winds were further accelerated by the presence of high air pressure over Texas.[12]  Temperatures ahead of a cold front concurrently moving east of the Rocky Mountains rose above 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) the day before the fire ignited and on the day of ignition, resulting in relative humidity values falling below 20\u00a0percent in the vicinity of Bastrop. Rainfall associated with the tropical storm did not expand west of Interstate 45, allowing the dry conditions in the Bastrop area to persist.[2] Winds decreased over the night of September\u00a03 and into the morning of September\u00a04, but the approach of the cold front into the Bastrop area resulted in the acceleration of winds oncemore.[3] Around the time of the Bastrop County Complex's initiation on September\u00a04, the distant tropical storm was generating sustained winds of 12\u201314\u00a0mph (19\u201323\u00a0km/h) and wind gusts of 25\u201331\u00a0mph (40\u201350\u00a0km/h) in the Bastrop area.[2] The high temperature on September\u00a04 was 101\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C), and the relative humidity bottomed out at 20\u00a0percent.[6] This combination of conditions led the Storm Prediction Center to forecast critical fire weather conditions over southern and central Texas for September\u00a04.[13] Throughout Texas, local fire departments responded to 227\u00a0fires on September\u00a04,[14] 57 of which were new fires.[15] The likelihood of a wildfire igniting given the prevailing weather conditions was around 90\u00a0percent.[16]"

        "content": "The wildfire complex began as three individual fires whose ignitions were reported within three hours on September\u00a04, 2011.[2][4] The first fire was ignited by fallen power lines near Circle D-KC Estates, Texas, located 16\u00a0mi (10\u00a0km) northeast of Bastrop.[4] A nearby homeowner called 9-1-1 at 2:20\u00a0p.m. CDT, reporting the fire.[14] An investigation performed by the Texas Forest Service (TFS) determined a point of origin near 258 Charolais Drive. Strong winds caused a pine tree to snap 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) above the ground, resulting in the upper trunk falling atop power lines and triggering sparks that reached the dry grass and leaf litter below.[16][17] The first fire grew quickly after ignition; the Bastrop volunteer fire department requested fire suppression equipment from the TFS at 2:25\u00a0p.m. CDT but determined at 2:33\u00a0p.m. CDT that the blaze was uncontrollable, prompting evacuations.[14] Thirty-two minutes later after the first ignition, a second fire initiated 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) to the north near Schwantz Ranch Road and U.S. Highway 290; the TFS determined that this second ignition was also caused by a tree falling upon power lines.[4][16][14] An investigation by Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative, which services the power lines in the region, arrived at similar conclusions for the cause of the fires.[18] Pushed southward by a strong northerly wind, the wildfire crossed Texas State Highway 21 at 3:02\u00a0p.m. CDT. Mike Fisher, the emergency management coordinator for Bastrop County, formally declared the situation a disaster at that time, authorizing aid from outside of the county. The conflagration subsequently spread into Bastrop State Park and began to encroach upon  Texas State Highway 71. The highway's right-of-way formed a preexisting firebreak spanning 325\u00a0ft (99\u00a0m) across. Firefighters set dead grass in the highway's median strip to deter expansion of the flames south of the highway, but were unsuccessful; the first fire crossed the highway at 4:07\u00a0p.m. CDT.[14] The two initial fires grew and aggregated into a single wildfire by 5\u00a0p.m. CDT after joining near Cardinal Drive, continuing to spread through Bastrop State Park and across Texas State Highway 71.[2][14] The third individual fire was ignited by a tree contacting a power line south of the highway near Tahitian Drive at 5:16\u00a0p.m. and eventually merged with the larger fire;[3][4][14] the complex of wildfires merged into a single wildfire within 48\u00a0hours of ignition.[2] During the first hours of the wildfire, the firefront advanced at 5\u00a0mph (8.0\u00a0km/h) through the pine and yaupon vegetation.[2] High winds carried hot embers far from the firefront, igniting fires as far as 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) away. Fire whirls were also observed along the firefront.[3] In addition to the strong winds, horizontal convective rolls embedded within the wind flow enabled the wildfire to quickly advance along the tops of the forest canopy, resulting in long streaks of intensely burned vegetation.[6][14] By the end of September\u00a04, the combined wildfire had scorched an area roughly 14\u00a0mi (23\u00a0km) long and up to 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) wide, covering 14,000\u00a0acres (5,660\u00a0hectares) of land.[14][19] The passage of a cold front ushered in a decrease in temperatures on September\u00a05. The movement of Tropical Storm Lee east away from Texas slackened winds, though gusts remained in the 20\u201325\u00a0mph (32\u201340\u00a0km/h) range. The combination of gusts with continued low relative humidity and strong atmospheric instability perpetuated environmental conditions conducive to large fire growth.[3] The Bastrop County Complex remained 0\u00a0percent contained heading into the afternoon of September\u00a05,[20] with its advance still unperturbed by firefighting efforts.[21] Flames reached the Colorado River and crossed south of the river twice during the day, hamstringing the ability for firefighters to obtain water.[22][23] State officials stated on September\u00a05 that the Bastrop County Complex had destroyed 476\u00a0homes, setting a record for the most homes destroyed by a single wildfire in Texas. The fire had engulfed over 25,000\u00a0acres (10,000\u00a0hectares) but its spread north of the Colorado River had slowed. Over 250\u00a0firefighters were working on containing the fire's spread, aided by bulldozers to create firebreaks and TFS air tankers.[24] The conflagration remained completely uncontained on September\u00a06. The TFS released a statement that day describing the fire's behavior as \"unprecedented\" and that \"no one on the face of this Earth has ever fought fires in these extreme conditions.\"[25][26] Considerable progress in containing the fire was made on September\u00a07, with fire containment reaching 30\u00a0percent and no additional structures being destroyed. The outward advance of the wildfire was mostly stopped, but burning continued within the preexisting burn area.[27] The TFS assessed that 785\u00a0homes had been destroyed by September\u00a07,[28] but the enumeration of the number of destroyed homes increased significantly the following day to 1,386 based on surveys conducted by Bastrop County officials.[29] The wildfire was 50\u00a0percent contained by noon on September\u00a010 and 70\u00a0percent contained by noon on September\u00a012.[30] Dry weather had remained in place over the Bastrop area for nearly two weeks after the wildfire first ignited, but light rain and humid conditions prevailed for the first time on September\u00a017, attenuating flare-ups within the burn area; at the time, the fire was 85\u00a0percent contained.[31] After September\u00a022, 18\u00a0days after ignition, the wildfire was 95\u00a0percent contained.[32] Beneficial rains on September\u00a024\u201325, including totals as much as 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) in parts of Bastrop County, allowed firefighters to target hot spots more deeply embedded within the fire perimeter.[33] The wildfire spread past a firebreak on October\u00a04 towards the northern portions of the previous burn scar, burning 309\u00a0acres (125\u00a0hectares) of land including parts of Griffith League Ranch. This extension of the Bastrop County Complex was called the Old Potato Road fire and was fully contained on October\u00a010.[32][34] The Bastrop County Complex was declared controlled on October\u00a010.[4] However, flare-ups within the burn area continued until October\u00a029, when the fire was completely extinguished. In total, the wildfire lasted for 55\u00a0days.[35] Another fire, called the Union Chapel Fire, began on the afternoon of September\u00a05 near Cedar Creek High School some 18\u00a0mi (29\u00a0km) to the west of the Bastrop County Complex.[36][37] Though a discrete fire, TFS operations considered the Union Chapel Fire a part of the Bastrop County Complex.[38][39] The fire consumed 912\u00a0acres (369\u00a0hectares) and destroyed 25\u00a0homes and 2\u00a0businesses, prompting the evacuation of 200\u00a0people, but was 90\u00a0percent contained by September\u00a08.[40][41][42][3]"

Combined with the nearby Union Chapel Fire, 2,367\u00a0drops of water or fire retardant were performed in September\u00a02011, equivalent to 2.3\u00a0million gallons (8.7\u00a0million liters) of fire suppression payload.

Homes were destroyed in ten subdivisions, with the greatest losses occurring in Circle-D County Acres and Tahitian Village subdivisions. Structures were destroyed in five incorporated and unincorporated communities: Bastrop, Cedar Creek, McDade, Paige, and Smithville. A majority of the structures destroyed were in the Bastrop area.[3] Based on the number of homes destroyed, the Bastrop County Complex was the most destructive in Texas history and third most destructive in U.S. history; however, accounting for fires for which official enumerations of damage do not exist, the fire may have been the sixth most destructive in U.S. history.[7] The previous record for the most homes destroyed by a single fire in Texas was 168, set by the Possum Kingdom Fire in April\u00a02011.[3] The Insurance Council of Texas estimated that the fire inflicted $325\u00a0million in insured losses, making the Bastrop County Complex the costliest wildfire in Texas history and among the costliest in U.S. history.[65][66] The estimated toll exceeded the estimated losses statewide from fires in 2009\u00a0\u2013 the costliest year for wildfires in the state before 2011.[65][67] Accounting for the populations of counties in which destructive wildfires have occurred, the Bastrop County complex may have at the time been the costliest conflagration per capita in the wildland\u2013urban interface in U.S. history based on an estimated loss of $209.3\u00a0million as estimated by the Bastrop Tax Appraisal District.[3] Power outages caused or prompted by the fire affected 3,800\u00a0homes;[68] all power was restored by September\u00a027.[69] The two people killed by the fire were found on September\u00a06, 2011, after law enforcement and search crews combed through burned neighborhoods.[70][71] One person was found near Smithville and the other near Paige; both of the fatalities were in neighborhoods that had been evacuated.[72][73] Urban Search and Rescue Texas Task Force 1 was later deployed to the area to search for additional victims.[74] The Bastrop County Complex affected 96\u00a0percent of Bastrop State Park,[35] leaving only around 100\u00a0acres (40\u00a0hectares) untouched.[75] Seventy percent of the park was severely burned.[76] The only unburned areas were the park's golf course, the curtilage around structures, and areas subjected to prescribed fires in February\u00a02011.[3] Two scenic overlook buildings within the park built in the 1930s, among other historic structures, were destroyed.[77] The regional state parks office near Bastrop State Park was also destroyed by the fire.[55] However, firefighters successfully prevented the wildfire from damaging many other cabins and structures in the park built by the Civilian Conservation Corps.[78] Vegetation in the park suffered extensively, leading to the loss of around 70\u00a0percent of canopy trees and 90\u201392\u00a0percent of understory vegetation.[3] The elimination of groundcover by the fire enabled extensive soil erosion within the park following heavy rainfall in January\u00a02012, damaging archeological sites including those dating back to the Paleo-Indians.[79] The fire also spread across 39\u00a0percent of the Lost Pines ecoregion.[80] Most of the habitat of the endangered Houston toad (Anaxyrus houstonensis) was destroyed by the wildfire.[77] Their abundances were not strongly affected by the habitat loss in subsequent years,[81] though the fire may have pushed their populations beyond their typical range within Bastrop County.[82] Similarly, the populations of other native amphibians and reptiles\u00a0\u2013 namely the six-lined racerunner (Cnemidophorus sexlineatus), southern prairie lizard (Sceloporus consobrinus), and Hurter's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus hurteri)\u00a0\u2013 did not decrease as a result of the fire.[80] Riparian forests\u00a0\u2013 common nesting habitats for birds\u00a0\u2013 remained largely intact in the fire.[3] Approximately 1.5\u00a0million trees were either killed by the fire or assessed by the TFS as being \"alive but likely to die soon\". More than 16,200\u00a0acres (6,600\u00a0hectares) of forest burned in the wildfire, and over 24\u00a0million ft3 (680,000\u00a0m3) of timber was either destroyed or irreparably damaged, representing 78\u00a0percent of trees in the areas affected by the fire.[83] The fire burned unevenly, leaving some areas lightly scorched while burning other areas so thoroughly that all nutrients were purged from the underlying soil.[2] The strong winds that sparked the fire carried ashes and embers to great distances. Softball-sized aggregations of charred pine trees were found in Rosanky, Texas, 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) south of the Colorado River.[14]"

That same day, the White House issued a formal statement, saying that \"Over the last several days, at the request of the Governor, the Administration has granted eight Fire Management Assistance Grants, making federal funds available to reimburse eligible costs associated with efforts to combat the fires.

An additional 65,000\u00a0yd3 (50,000\u00a0m3) of construction and demolition debris was also removed by the county. Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative replaced 1,223\u00a0burned poles in the fire perimeter and added 61\u00a0mi (98\u00a0km) of electrical wire for $7.1\u00a0million.[3] Vegetation in Bastrop State Park began to regrow after the fire. Recovery efforts were costly, with erosion control costing at least three times the park's annual budget and lolloby pine replanting costing at least seven times the park's annual budget. The park partially reopened on December\u00a02, 2011, but closed again the next month following heavy rainfall. After additional park rehabilitation projects were completed, most hiking trails, camping areas, and cabins in the park reopened to the public.[104][76] Several lawsuits were filed against private companies concerning the inadequate pruning of trees near power lines. A class-action lawsuit filed against the Asplundh Tree Expert Company and Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative was dismissed in 2015. The Bastrop County government, Bastrop County Emergency Services District No. 2, Bastrop Independent School District, Smithville Independent School District filed a lawsuit against Asplundh on April 1, 2016, alleging that the defendant failed to sufficiently prune trees that ultimately damaged power lines and sparked the fires while being aware of the associated risk given the prevailing weather conditions.[105] A third lawsuit involving the same parties was filed in 2018 and reached a $5\u00a0million settlement in 2020.[106]"

        "content": " FireHouse (also Firehouse) is an American hard rock band that formed in 1984 in Richmond, Virginia. They then moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where they signed with Epic Records in 1989.[5] The band reached stardom during the early 1990s with charting singles like \"Don't Treat Me Bad,\" \"All She Wrote,\" and \"Reach for the Sky,\" as well as their signature power ballads \"Love of a Lifetime,\" \"When I Look into Your Eyes,\" and \"I Live My Life for You.\" At the 1992 American Music Awards, FireHouse won the award for \"Favorite New Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Artist.\"[6] As the 1990s progressed, the band remained very popular in Asia, mainly in Japan and Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore. They also maintained popularity in South America and Europe.[5] FireHouse continued to release new material throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, most of which successfully charted in Japan. The band has also continued to tour internationally, having participated twice in the annual Rock Never Stops Tour with other bands from the same genre. FireHouse is estimated to have sold over 7 million albums worldwide since their debut.[7] Originally composed of vocalist/keyboardist C. J. Snare, guitarist Bill Leverty, drummer Michael Foster and bassist Perry Richardson, the band has maintained its original members with the exception of Richardson, who departed in 2000. Richardson was replaced two times before current bassist, Allen McKenzie, was given the position in 2004.[8] Snare remained as the lead singer of FireHouse until his death on April 5, 2024.[9] He was replaced by a former American Idol Season 21 contestant Nate Peck, who has been touring with the band since 2023 taking Snare's place as a temporary lead vocalist, citing health issues.[10]"

        "content": "The history of FireHouse can be traced back to 1984, when Leverty's band White Heat needed a drummer. After over 20 auditions, current FireHouse drummer Michael Foster answered the ad and when Leverty was impressed by his skill, he quickly hired him. When the band wasn't on tour, Leverty and Foster would visit rock clubs, and it was at one of these clubs where they caught sight of a band called Maxx Warrior.[5] Singing for the band was C. J. Snare, and the band's bassist was Perry Richardson. Leverty and Foster were impressed with Snare's vocal ability, and became determined to unite the bands.[5] As soon as Maxx Warrior broke up, Leverty sent Snare some of his songs and asked him to sing on his tape. Foster and Leverty were again impressed, so they brought Snare in to be the band's lead singer for a show in Virginia several weeks later.[5] The three-member group took their tape to Perry Richardson, the ex-bassist for Maxx Warrior, who said he liked it but had made a six-month commitment to the band that he was a member of at the time. When the commitment was fulfilled, Richardson and his new bandmates moved to Charlotte, North Carolina and began recording demos in Leverty's bedroom. The band would record all day and play hotel shows at night to earn income. Since Leverty and Foster's band name of White Heat was trademarked, the band chose FireHouse instead. In December 1989, Michael Caplan of Epic Records flew to Charlotte, NC to see a FireHouse show, and told the band immediately following the performance that they were ready for a record deal. The band went into the studio with David Prater as producer.[5] Prater, who later produced bands such as Dream Theater and having drummed with Santana, produced the band's first two albums."

        "content": "The band's self-titled debut in 1990, FireHouse, was met with much critical acclaim. The band won the American Music Award for Best New Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Band of 1992, Metal Edge Magazine's Best New Band of 1991, Young Guitar Magazine's Best Newcomer of 1991, and Music Life Magazine's reader's pop poll Best Newcomer of the Year 1992.[5] The band's first album sold over two million copies in the United States, and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. The band's third and most successful single, \"Love of a Lifetime\", reached No.\u00a03 selling over 500,000 copies. Other singles also charted including the harder-rocking \"Don't Treat Me Bad\" at No.\u00a014. The first single from the album, \"Shake & Tumble\" enjoyed success on the radio and brought attention to the band, but it failed to chart on the Pop charts, although it did at Metal radio.[11] The album went on to become certified gold in Canada, Singapore, and Japan. The band followed their impressive debut with Hold Your Fire in 1992. Although not as successful as its predecessor due to the recent explosion of grunge and alternative rock, Hold Your Fire produced three more charting singles and was certified gold in the US. To date, Hold Your Fire has soundscanned over 873,000 copies in the United States alone. Singles from the album included \"Sleeping with You\", \"Reach for the Sky\", and the power ballad \"When I Look into Your Eyes\". The latter single became a top 10 hit in the United States.[11] For the band's third album, aptly titled 3, they changed producers. Ron Nevison, who had served as producer for Led Zeppelin, Ozzy Osbourne, Europe, Heart, and many other groups, produced this album.[5] While the band's success had waned in the United States by 3's release in 1995, the album brought them more success overseas than ever before. Despite the album not selling well in the United States compared to previous albums, it was certified gold in several Asian countries, giving the band an opportunity to tour in countries like India and Thailand. The lead single from the album, \"I Live My Life for You\", was the band's third Top 40 ballad in the United States.[11] Snare remarked that despite drastic changes in the industry, FireHouse was the only band of its genre that managed to have a Top 40 hit as late as 1995, without having to make drastic changes to their sound.[12] 3's follow-up, Good Acoustics, was a collection of acoustic arrangements of several of their greatest hits, as well as four new songs. Good Acoustics, produced by the band's guitarist Bill Leverty, went gold in six countries around the world including Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.[11] Tracks \"In Your Perfect World\", \"You Are My Religion\", and \"Love Don't Care\" became hits in many Asian countries. After the album's release, the band launched their second tour of Asia which ended in late 1996. It was followed by another tour of Indonesia, Thailand, and Japan in February 1997, including several sold-out shows. The band returned to Southeast Asia in July and played an unprecedented 25 city sold-out tour of Indonesia.[11] After this time, the band asked to be released from their contract due to their label's lack of promotion in the United States, after eight years of being signed to Epic Records in 1989. They made a significant change when they signed with Pony Canyon from Japan. With the decline in popularity among rock acts of the 1980s in the US, and their steady fame in Asia and elsewhere abroad, they agreed to release Category 5 with their new label. They toured heavily throughout Asia during 1998 and 1999, achieving great success with their album. They continued to tour heavily in the United States as well, performing on the first ever \"Rock Never Stops Tour\" all over America in 1998. This tour featured fellow 1980s rock bands including Slaughter and Quiet Riot. On April 22, 1999, FireHouse recorded a live show in Osaka, Japan, and released it with the title Bring 'Em Out Live later that year."

        "content": "Sometime in 2000, the band parted ways with bassist Perry Richardson due to personal conflict and hired Bruce Waibel, who had played in The Gregg Allman Band for 10 years. Leverty met Waibel in Sarasota, Florida, and was impressed with his bass guitar skills.[13] When the band had an opening for a bassist due to Richardson's departure, Leverty contacted Waibel and asked him to join the band. With Waibel, they recorded their next album, O2, and toured on the Metal Edge 2002 tour with Dokken, Ratt, Warrant, and L.A. Guns. After the twelve-week tour, Waibel parted ways with the band to spend more time with his family.[13] In 2003, Waibel died unexpectedly at age 45. Guitarist Bill Leverty expressed the band's sadness over his death in a statement shortly after the news broke.[13] Initially, Waibel was replaced by Brazilian Dario Seixas, who played bass on the band's 2003 critically acclaimed album Prime Time, but Seixas left the band shortly after, so the band announced that they were in need of a bass player. Allen McKenzie, who was playing bass for Jani Lane's solo project at the time, sent in his audition tape, and the band agreed that he was the right musician for the job.[12] In December 2004, FireHouse became the first major international rock band to play concert dates in northeast India.[14] The band's first Indian concert date was in Shillong, followed by two more dates in Dimapur, and Aizawl.[14] The band's first Indian date, in Shillong When the Maharaja of Tripura Kirit Pradyot Deb Burman invited them, took place in front of a sold out stadium crowd of over 40,000, setting a record for that city.[12] The band toured in 2005, 2006, and launched another tour in 2007 visiting states in the Midwest United States such as North Dakota and playing at several festivals including Rocklahoma.[15] In a March 2007 interview, when asked about the band's next album, guitarist Bill Leverty said \"we plan on going into the studio this coming winter. Hopefully, we'll be able to get all the songs together and record them for a spring/summer release.\"[7] Regarding the future of the band, C. J. Snare commented that \"this has been an incredible, incredible career. To do something that you love, to be an artist, to be an entertainer and to actually go out there and have fans all over the world and be able to make a living at it... as long as that's perpetuated, I don't see any reason to ever stop.\"[12] In 2011 the band released their eighth studio album titled Full Circle, which featured re-recorded versions of some of their older tracks. Longtime FireHouse singer C. J. Snare died on April 5, 2024.[9] At the time of his death, Snare had taken a hiatus from the band due to health concerns and was replaced by American Idol season 21 contestant Nate Peck, who had filled in for him during their 2023 live performances.[9][16] A month after Snare's death, FireHouse announced that Peck would officially be taking over as the band's new frontman.[10]"

        "content": "The first description of the diprotodont species was published by Paul Gervais and Jules Verreaux on 3 March 1842, referring to a specimen collected by Verreaux. The lectotype nominated for this species, held in the collection at National Museum of Natural History, France, was collected the Swan River Colony.[1][4] A description of a second species Tarsipes spenserae,[5] published five days later by John Edward Gray and current until the 1970s, was thought to have been published earlier by T. S. Palmer in 1904[6] and displaced the usage of T.\u00a0rostratus. A review by Mahoney in 1984 again reduced T. spenserae to a synonym for the species, as was the emendation to its spelling as spencerae cited by William Ride (1970) and others.[7][8][9]\nGray's specimen was provided by George Grey to the British Museum of Natural History, the skin of a male also collected at King George Sound.[4]\nThe author was aware of the description prepared by Gervais, who after examining his specimen suggested it represented a second species. The population is the only known species in the genus Tarsipes, and assigned to a monotypic diprotodont family Tarsipedidae.[10] The name of the genus means \"tarsier-foot\", given for a resemblance to tarsier's simian-like feet and toes noted by the earliest descriptions.[11] The poorly resolved phylogeny of ancestral marsupial relationships has presented this taxon, unique in many characteristics, in an arrangement of other higher classifications, including the separation as a superfamily Tarsipedoidea, later abandoned in favour grouping of South American and Australian marsupials as a monophyletic clade that ignores the modern geographic remoteness of these continent's fauna.[12] The relationships of the monotypic family within the Diprotodontia order as a petauroid alliance may be summarised as, The closest relationship to other taxa was theorised to be Dromiciops gliroides, another smaller marsupial that occurs in South America and is known as the extant member of a genus that is represented in the Gondwanan fossil record. This was supported by phylogenetic analysis,[9] but this is no longer believed to be true.[13] At Grey's suggestion, the maiden name of his wife Eliza Lucy Spencer was assigned to the epithet. Eliza or Elizabeth was the daughter of the government resident at King George Sound, Richard Spencer, prompting the unacceptable correction by Ride in 1970. The common names include those cited or coined by Gilbert, Gould and Ellis Troughton, honey and long-snouted phalanger, tait and noolbenger in the local languages, or the descriptive brown barred mouse. An ethnographic survey of Noongar words recorded for the species found three names were in use, and proposed that these be regularised for spelling and pronunciation as ngoolboongoor (ngool'bong'oor), djebin (dje'bin) and dat.[14] The term honey mouse was recorded by Troughton in 1922 as commonly used in the districts around King George Sound.[8]"

        "content": "A tiny marsupial that climbs woody plants to feed on the pollen and nectar, the honey, of banksia and eucalypts. They resemble a small mouse or the arboreal possums of Australia, and are readily distinguished by the exceptionally long muzzle and three brown stripes from the head to the rump.\nThe pelage is a cream colour below that merges to rufous at the flanks, the overall coloration of the upperparts is a mix of brown and grey hairs. A dark brown central stripe extends from the rump to a mid-point between the ears, this is a more distinct stripe than the two paler adjacent stripes. The length of the tail is from 70 to 100 millimetres (2.8 to 3.9\u00a0in), exceeding the combined body and head length of 65 to 85\u00a0mm (2.6 to 3.3\u00a0in), and has a prehensile ability that assists in climbing. The recorded weight range for the species is 5 to 10 grams (0.18 to 0.35\u00a0oz).[15]\nThe number of teeth are fewer and most much smaller than is typical for marsupials, with the molars reduced to tiny cones. The dental formula of I2/1 C1/0 P1/0 M3/3 totals no more than 22 teeth.[11]\nThe morphology of the elongated snout's jaws and dentition presents a number of unique characteristics suited to the specialisation as a palynivore and nectivore.\nTarsipes tongue is extensible and the end covered in brush-like papillae, with the redundant action of the modified or reduced teeth being replaced by the interaction of the tongue, keel-like lower incisors and a fine combing surface at the palate.[16][11] The testes are very large in size, noted as proportionally the greatest for a mammal at 4.6 percent of the body weight. The sperm also has an exceptional length; its tail (flagellum) measurement of 360 micrometres also cited as the longest known.[17]\nSpecialised characters of T.\u00a0rostratus include visual acuity for detecting the bright yellow inflorescence of Banksia attenuata.[18] They have a typical lifespan between one and two years.[19] They have trichromat vision, similar to some other marsupials as well as primates but unlike most mammals which have dichromat vision.[20]"

        "header": "Behaviour",
        "content": "The honey possum is mainly nocturnal, but will come out to feed during daylight in cooler weather. Generally, though, it spends the days asleep in a shelter of convenience: a rock cranny, a tree cavity, the hollow inside of a grass tree, or an abandoned bird nest.[citation needed] When food is scarce, or in cold weather, it becomes torpid to conserve energy. In comparison to other marsupials of a similar size, T.\u00a0rostratus has a high body temperature and metabolic rate that is termed euthermic. Lacking fat reserves, but able to reduce their body temperature, exposure to cooler temperatures or lack of food induces one of two states of torpor. One response is a shallow and brief period, similar to torpid dasyurids, where the body temperature is above 10\u201315 degrees Celsius, and another deeper state like the burramyids that lasts for multiple days and reduces their temperature to less than 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F).[21] The species is able to climb with the assistance of the prehensile tail and an opposable first toe at the long hindfoot that is able to grip like a monkey's paw. The bristle-like papillae at the upper surface of the tongue increase in length toward the tip, and this is used to gather the pollen and nectar by rapidly wiping it into the inflorescence.[3]\nBoth its front and back feet are adept at grasping, enabling it to climb trees with ease, as well as traverse the undergrowth at speed. The honey possum can also use its prehensile tail (which is longer than its head and body combined) to grip, much like another arm.[19] Radio-tracking has shown that males particularly are quite mobile, moving distances of up to 0.5\u00a0km in a night and use areas averaging 0.8 hectares.[22] Males seem to venture out in a larger range, and some evidence indicates greater distances covered; evidence of pollen found on an individual in a study area was from a banksia not found within three kilometres of the collection site.[9] The plant species that provide nectar and pollen to T.\u00a0rostratus are primarily genera of Proteaceae, Banksia and Adenanthos, and Myrtaceae, eucalypts and Agonis, and those of Epacridaceae, shrubby heath plants, although it is also known to visit the inflorescence of Anigozanthos, the kangaroo paws, and the tall spikes of Xanthorrhoea, the grass-trees.[9]\nStudy of the amount of nectar and pollen has concluded that a nine gram individual requires around seven millilitres of nectar and one gram of pollen each day to maintain an energetic balance. This amount of pollen provides sufficient nitrogen for the species high activity metabolism, and the additional nitrogen requirements of females during lactation is available in the pollen of Banksia species.\nThe ingestion of excess water when feeding at wet flowers, a frequent circumstance in the high rainfall regions of its range, is able to be eliminated by kidneys that can process up to two times the animal's body weight in water.[23]\nPollen grains are digested over the course of six hours, extracting almost all the nutrients they contain.[9]"

        "header": "Reproduction",
        "content": "Breeding depends on the availability of nectar and can occur at any time of the year. Females are promiscuous, mating with a large number of males and may simultaneously carry embryos from different progenitors. Competition has led to the males having very large testicles relative to their body weight, at a relative mass of 4.2% it is amongst the largest known for a mammal. Their sperm is the largest in the mammal world, measuring 365 micrometres.[17] The development of blastocysts corresponds to day length, induced by a shorter photoperiod, but other reproductive processes are prompted by other factor, probably food availability.[24] Gestation lasts for 28 days, with two to four young being produced. At birth, they are the smallest of any mammal, weighing 0.005 g.[citation needed] Nurturing and development within the pouch lasts for about 60 days, after which they emerge covered in fur and with open eyes, weighing some 2.5\u00a0g (0.088\u00a0oz). As soon as they emerge, they are often left in a sheltered area (such as a hollow in a tree) while the mother searches for food for herself, but within days, they learn to grab hold of the mother's back and travel with her. However, their weight soon becomes too much, and they stop nursing at around 11 weeks, and start to make their own homes shortly thereafter.[19] As is common in marsupials, a second litter is often born when the pouch is vacated by the first, fertilised embryos being stopped from developing.[25] Most of the time, honey possums stick to separate territories of about one hectare (2.5 acres),[26] outside of the breeding season. They live in small groups of no more than 10, which results in them engaging in combat with one another only rarely. During the breeding season, females move into smaller areas with their young, which they will defend fiercely, especially from any males.[19]"

Their feeding activity involves visits to many individual plants and the head carries a small pollen load that can convey more effectively than the birds that visit the same flowers. The favoured species Banksia attenuata appears to be obliged to this animal as a pollination vector, and both species have evolved to suit their mutualistic interactions.[27] The effect of fire frequency on the population was evaluated in a study over a twenty three-year period, giving indications of resilience of the species to the first fire in the area and a subsequent burn six years later. The effect of increased frequency and intensity of fire, due to global warming and prescribed burns can adversely affect the suitability of the local habitat.[28]\nThe species is susceptible to the impact of Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil borne fungal-like species that is associated with forest dieback in the eucalypt forests and banksia woodlands of the region. The flowers of the nine plant species most favoured by T.\u00a0rostratus provide food throughout the year, and five of these are vulnerable to the withering condition caused by P.\u00a0cinnamomi pathogen.[18] It is the only entirely nectarivorous mammal which is not a bat;[29] it has a long, pointed snout and a long, protrusile tongue with a brush tip that gathers pollen and nectar, like a honeyeater or a hummingbird. Floral diversity is particularly important for the honey possum, as it cannot survive without a year-round supply of nectar and, unlike nectarivorous birds, it cannot easily travel long distances in search of fresh supplies."

Gilbert obtained access to Noongar informants that provided him with the names and details of the animal's habits and, with some difficulty, four specimens for scientific examination. Both he and Gould recognised the unique characters of the unknown species.[9] The next major field study was undertaken by the mammalogist Ellis Troughton at the suggestion of H. L. White, who provided an introduction to the professional collector F. Lawson Whitlock. Troughton's visit to King George Sound was guided by Whitlock to the source of a specimen he had sent to White, a man in the same region named David Morgan who accommodated the biologist while he searched extensively and unsuccessfully for further specimens. Troughton was eventually provided with a series of a dozen specimens when he was preparing to leave Albany port, a collection assembled over many years by the cats of Hugh Leishman at Nannarup.\nThe collection of the Australian Museum was increased when Morgan continued to forward specimens to Troughton, firstly with two pregnant females that were also killed by a cat, and then with a report of living animals he was able to maintain in captivity for five to six weeks. Morgan reported that his cat would bring a mangled specimen on a daily basis for a period of time, and observed it seeking them in a flowering shrub at dusk, but thought their local appearance was seasonally related and became absent outside the breeding season.[8] Closer study of the reproductive processes was allowed by the capture, extended observation and dissection of the species in University programs, the first success in captivity beginning in 1974. Examination of the reproductive strategies has allowed comparison to the other modern marsupial families, in particular the evolution of embryonic diapause.[31]\nThe population structure and feeding habits of T.\u00a0rostratus was poorly understood until a biological study at the Fitzgerald River National Park was completed in 1984.[9] A diet consisting entirely of nectar is unusual for a terrestrial vertebrate species, usually birds and flying mammals, and specialisation to the niche provided by the success of plant families Proteaceae and Myrtaceae began around forty million years ago.[9]"

        "content": " The Grand Canyon[a] is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in Arizona, United States. The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446\u00a0km) long, up to 18 miles (29\u00a0km) wide and attains a depth of over a mile (6,093 feet or 1,857 meters).[6]:\u200a902 The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park, the Kaibab National Forest, Grand Canyon\u2013Parashant National Monument, the Hualapai Indian Reservation, the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation. The surrounding area is contained within the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni \u2013 Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of the preservation of the Grand Canyon area and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery. Nearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted.[7][8] While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists,[7][9] several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago.[7][1][10][11] Since that time, the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs, simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon. For thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans, who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site, and made pilgrimages to it.[12] The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas from Spain, who arrived in 1540.[13]"

Geologically, it is significant because of the thick sequence of ancient rocks that are well preserved and exposed in the walls of the canyon. These rock layers record much of the early geologic history of the North American continent.[7] Uplift associated with mountain formation later moved these sediments thousands of feet upward and created the Colorado Plateau. The higher elevation has also resulted in greater precipitation in the Colorado River drainage area, but not enough to change the Grand Canyon area from being semi-arid.[17] The uplift of the Colorado Plateau is uneven, and the Kaibab Plateau that the Grand Canyon bisects is over one thousand feet (300\u00a0m) higher at the North Rim than at the South Rim. Almost all runoff from the North Rim (which also gets more rain and snow) flows toward the Grand Canyon, while much of the runoff on the plateau behind the South Rim flows away from the canyon (following the general tilt).[7] The result is deeper and longer tributary washes and canyons on the north side and shorter and steeper side canyons on the south side.[6]:\u200a406 Temperatures on the North Rim are generally lower than those on the South Rim because of the greater elevation (averaging 8,000 feet or 2,400 meters above sea level).[18] Heavy rains are common on both rims during the summer months. Access to the North Rim via the primary route leading to the canyon (State Route 67) is limited during the winter season due to road closures.[19]"

        "content": "The Grand Canyon is part of the Colorado River basin, which has developed over the past 70\u00a0million years.[7][20] For more than 150 years, scientists have gathered data, proposed new ideas, and debated sometimes contentious theories about the geologic origins of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River. Formation of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River may involve a complex history in which multiple factors and geologic processes have interacted over time and in different locations.[14] In the most recent round of \"old river\" vs. \"young river\" controversy, researchers have challenged estimates that had placed the age of the canyon at 5\u20136\u00a0million years. The research has aroused considerable controversy because it suggests a substantial departure from prior widely supported scientific consensus.[21][22][7] In a 2008 study, Victor Polyak examined caves near the Grand Canyon and placed their origins about 17\u00a0million years ago. The study, which was published in the journal Science in 2008, used uranium-lead dating to analyze calcite deposits found on the walls of nine caves throughout the canyon.[23][24][25] In another 2008 study, Rebecca Flowers reported on apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry results suggesting that parts of the Grand Canyon had reached a depth near to the modern depth around 20\u00a0million years ago.[26][27]\nIn a subsequent study published in the journal Science in 2012, she suggested that the western part of the Grand Canyon could be as old as 70\u00a0million years.[28][26][29][30] The emerging scientific consensus is that the canyon is made up of multiple segments which formed at different times and eventually connected to become the waterway now traversed by the Colorado River. Of the three central segments, the \"Hurricane\" was formed 50\u201370\u00a0million years ago, and the \"Eastern Grand Canyon\" was cut 15\u201325\u00a0million years ago. In contrast, the \"Marble Canyon\" and \"Westernmost Grand Canyon\" segments at the ends of the canyon were carved in the last five to six million years.[31][32] The major geologic exposures in the Grand Canyon range in age from the two-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist at the bottom of the Inner Gorge to the 270-million-year-old Kaibab Limestone on the Rim. There is a gap of about a billion years between 1.75\u00a0billion and 1.25\u00a0billion years ago. This large unconformity indicates a long period for which no deposits are present.[7] Then, between 1.25\u00a0billion and 730\u00a0million years ago, intermittent sediments began to form the Grand Canyon Supergroup.[7] Many of the formations were deposited in warm shallow seas, near-shore environments (such as beaches), and swamps as the seashore repeatedly advanced and retreated over the edge of a proto-North America. Major exceptions include the Permian Coconino Sandstone, which contains abundant geological evidence of aeolian sand dune deposition. Several parts of the Supai Group also were deposited in non-marine environments. The great depth of the Grand Canyon and especially the height of its strata (most of which formed below sea level) can be attributed to 5,000\u201310,000 feet (1,500\u20133,000\u00a0m) of uplift of the Colorado Plateau, starting about 65\u00a0million years ago (during the Laramide orogeny). This uplift has steepened the stream gradient of the Colorado River and its tributaries, which in turn has increased their speed and thus their ability to cut through rock (see the elevation summary of the Colorado River for present conditions). Weather conditions during the ice ages also increased the amount of water in the Colorado River drainage system. The ancestral Colorado River responded by cutting its channel faster and deeper. The base level and course of the Colorado River (or its ancestral equivalent) changed 5.3\u00a0million years ago when the Gulf of California opened and lowered the river's base level (its lowest point). This increased the rate of erosion and cut nearly all of the Grand Canyon's current depth by 1.2\u00a0million years ago. The terraced walls of the canyon were created by differential erosion.[33] Between 100,000 and 3\u00a0million years ago, volcanic activity deposited ash and lava over the area, which at times completely obstructed the river. These volcanic rocks are the youngest in the canyon."

        "header": "Hydrology",
        "content": "Groundwater flow in the Grand Canyon region is an active area of study.\nGroundwater forms when rain soaks down into the earth and reaches the water table. The composition of the earth in a given area determines its permeability, the ease with which water flows through it. Sand is more permeable than clay. Less permeable rock layers composed of clay can block the passage of water and are known as aquitards. More permeable areas of rock that hold and transport groundwater underground are known as aquifers. An area of water bounded by two aquitards is called a confined aquifer, while water below the surface and above an aquitard is called an unconfined aquifer.[34] The different geologic levels of the Grand Canyon have created two major aquifers where groundwater collects. The higher C-aquifer is an unconfined aquifer. It collects groundwater that seeps through the Kaibab and Toroweap Formations into the Coconino Sandstone. Below it, the Permian Hermit Formation and Supai Group provide a dense barrier. Groundwater from the C-acquifer can flow laterally, appearing as seeps along the canyon walls at the base of the Coconino Sandstone but can also descend vertically through fault zones to recharge the underlying confined R-aquifer. The R-aquifer, also known as the Red Wall Muav aquifer, is a karst aquifer. It involves an area of substantial fracturing through the Redwall Limestone, Temple Butte Formation and Cambrian Muav Limestone of the Tonto Group. Five individual systems flow through the R-aquifer and compose the regional groundwater-flow system which drains into the Grand Canyon: Kaibab, Uinkaret-Kanab, Marble-Shinumo, Cataract, and Blue Spring.[35] The flow of groundwater in the Grand Canyon region is influenced in multiple ways by geologic faults and folds. Discharge from the R-aquifer appears as springs and seeps in both the Grand Canyon and tributary canyons. Springs discharge to the Grand Canyon in areas of lower Paleozoic carbonates, and are associated with geologic faults and fractures. Fractures are believed to provide dominant pathways both for vertical circulation in the Paleozoic section, and for lateral collection and transport of water to springs deep in the canyons. The largest springs discharge from the R-aquifer. A smaller number of springs discharge at lower rates from the C-aquifer. Much of the water that could potentially recharge the aquifers is likely released as springs rather than reaching the aquifers.[35] Studies of the chemical composition of groundwater at sites across the Grand Canyon region indicate that groundwater contains a fraction of modern water (post-1950), and that many springs have a mix of modern water and older groundwater. Estimated mean ages for South Rim groundwater range from 6 years old (San Francisco Peaks) to nearly 20,000 years old (Bar Four well, Blue Spring). Groundwater age in the South Rim groundwater system also correlates to longitude, with age increasing from east to west from Red Canyon to Boucher springs. Surprisingly, the Canyon Mine Observation well is more similar to Redwall-Muav aquifer wells (R-aquifer) than to the Coconino C-aquifer. This suggests the possibility of a hydrologic connection or similar recharge sources for that hydrologic position. Old groundwater from Havasupai well may have a similar source to the Havasu Spring upwelling from the Redwall-Muav aquifer. Sites with younger estimated mean ages tend to be associated with the unconfined Coconino aquifer. They may recharge quickly as a result of snowmelt, run-off and local precipitation. It is likely that the deeper confined R-aquifer relies primarily on snowmelt from the San Francisco Peaks to recharge.[36] Other research has tried to relate groundwater flow paths to possible levels of risk for contamination and identify vulnerability regions for the underlying aquifers. Almost half of the Kaibab plateau's surface was associated with high to very high vulnerability of the unconfined Coconino aquifer (C-aquifer), while about a fifth of the Kaibab Plateau was estimated to be an area of high vulnerability for the Redwall-Muav aquifer (R-aquifer).[37][38]"

They were the first people known to live in the Grand Canyon area. The cultural group has often been referred to in archaeology as the Anasazi, although the term is not preferred by the modern Puebloan peoples.[39] The word \"Anasazi\" is Navajo for \"enemy ancestors\" or \"alien ancestors\".[40] Archaeologists still debate when this distinct culture emerged. The current consensus, based on terminology defined by the Pecos Classification, suggests their emergence was around 1200\u00a0BCE during the Basketmaker II Era. Beginning with the earliest explorations and excavations, researchers have believed that the Ancestral Puebloans are ancestors of the modern Pueblo peoples.[41] In addition to the Ancestral Puebloans, a number of distinct cultures have inhabited the Grand Canyon area. The Cohonina lived to the west of the Grand Canyon, between 500 and 1200\u00a0CE.[42][43] The Cohonina were ancestors of the Yuman, Havasupai, and Hualapai peoples who inhabit the area today.[44] The Sinagua were a cultural group occupying an area to the southeast of the Grand Canyon, between the Little Colorado River and the Salt River, between approximately 500 and 1425 CE. The Sinagua may have been ancestors of several Hopi clans. By the time of the arrival of Europeans in the 16th\u00a0century, newer cultures had evolved. The Hualapai inhabit a 100-mile (160\u00a0km) stretch along the pine-clad southern side of the Grand Canyon. The Havasupai have been living in the area near Cataract Canyon since the beginning of the 13th\u00a0century, occupying an area the size of Delaware.[45] The Southern Paiutes live in what is now southern Utah and northern Arizona. The Navajo, or Din\u00e9, live in a wide area stretching from the San Francisco Peaks eastwards towards the Four Corners. Archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests the Navajo descended from the Athabaskan people near Great Slave Lake, Canada, who migrated after the 11th\u00a0century.[46] In the mythology of some Third Mesa Hopi communities, the Grand Canyon was the location humankind arose out of the Third World from a sipapu.[47]"

Pablo de Melgrossa, Juan Galeras, and a third soldier descended some one third of the way into the canyon until they were forced to return because of lack of water. In their report, they noted that some of the rocks in the canyon were \"bigger than the great tower of Seville, Giralda\".[48] It is speculated that their Hopi guides likely knew routes to the canyon floor, but may have been reluctant to lead the Spanish to the river. No Europeans visited the canyon again for more than two hundred years. Fathers Francisco Atanasio Dom\u00ednguez and Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante were two Spanish priests who, with a group of Spanish soldiers, explored southern Utah and traveled along the north rim of the canyon in Glen and Marble Canyons in search of a route from Santa Fe to California in 1776. They eventually found a crossing, formerly known as the \"Crossing of the Fathers\", that today lies under Lake Powell. Also in 1776, Fray Francisco Garces, a Franciscan missionary, spent a week near Havasupai unsuccessfully attempting to convert a band of Native Americans to Christianity. He described the canyon as \"profound\".[48]"

        "content": "James Ohio Pattie, along with a group of American trappers and mountain men, may have been the next European to reach the canyon, in 1826.[49][50] Jacob Hamblin, a Mormon missionary, was sent by Brigham Young in the 1850s to locate suitable river crossing sites in the canyon. Building good relations with local Hualapai and white settlers, he reached the Crossing of the Fathers,[51] crossed the location that would become Lees Ferry on a raft in 1858[52] and Pearce Ferry (later operated by, and named for, Harrison Pearce).[53] He also acted as an advisor to John Wesley Powell, before his second expedition to the Grand Canyon, serving as a diplomat between Powell and the local native tribes to ensure the safety of his party.[52] In 1857, Edward Fitzgerald Beale was superintendent of an expedition to survey a wagon road along the 35th parallel from Fort Defiance, Arizona to the Colorado River. He led a small party of men in search of water on the Coconino Plateau near the canyon's south rim. On September 19, near present-day National Canyon, they came upon what May Humphreys Stacey described in his journal as \"a wonderful canyon; four thousand feet deep. Everybody in the party admitted that he never before saw anything to match or equal this astonishing natural curiosity.\"[54] Also in 1857, the U.S. War Department asked Lieutenant Joseph Ives to lead an expedition to assess the feasibility of an up-river navigation from the Gulf of California. On December 31, 1857, Ives embarked from the mouth of the Colorado in the stern wheeler steamboat Explorer. His party reached the lower end of Black Canyon on March 8, 1858, then continued on by rowboat past the mouth of the Virgin River after the Explorer struck a rock.[55][56] Ives led his party east into the canyon\u00a0\u2013 they may have been the first Europeans to travel the Diamond Creek drainage.[57] In his \"Report Upon the Colorado River of the West\" to the Senate in 1861 Ives states that \"The marvellous story of Cardinas, that had formed for so long a time the only record concerning this rather mythical locality, was rather magnified than detracted from by the accounts of one or two trappers, who professed to have seen the ca\u00f1on\".[58] According to the San Francisco Herald, in a series of articles run in 1853, Captain Joseph R. Walker in January 1851 with his nephew James T. Walker and six men, traveled up the Colorado River to a point where it joined the Virgin River and continued east into Arizona, traveling along the Grand Canyon and making short exploratory side trips along the way. Walker is reported to have said he wanted to visit the \"Moqui\" (Hopi) Indians. who he had met briefly before and found exceptionally interesting.[59] In 1858, John Strong Newberry became probably the first geologist to visit the Grand Canyon.[60] In 1869, Major John Wesley Powell set out to explore the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon in the first expedition down the canyon. Powell ordered a shipwright to build four reinforced Whitewall rowboats from Chicago and had them shipped west on the newly completed Continental railroad.[61] He hired nine men, including his brother Walter, and collected provisions for ten months. They set out from Green River, Wyoming, on May 24.[62] On June 7, they lost one of their boats, 1/3 of their food, and other badly-needed supplies: as a result the team eventually had to subsist on starvation rations.[63] Passing through (or portaging around) a series of dangerous rapids, the group passed down the Green River, reaching its confluence with the Colorado River, near present-day Moab, Utah, on July 17. Continuing on down the Colorado River, the party encountered more rapids and falls.[64] On August 28, 1869, faced with what some felt to be impassable rapids, three men left the expedition on foot in an attempt to reach a settlement 75 miles (121\u00a0km) away. Ironically, the remaining members went safely through the rapids on August 29, 1869, while Seneca Howland, Oramel Howland, and William H. Dunn were murdered.[63] The area through which the three men traveled was marked by tensions between farming and hunting Shivwits and incoming Mormon settlers. Which group was responsible for killing the three men has been hotly debated.[65] Powell himself visited the area the following year, and was told (through a Mormon interpreter) that the Shivwits had mistakenly killed the men, believing them to be prospectors who had murdered an Indian woman. He chose to smoke a peace pipe with them.[63][66]\nPowell went on to become the first Director of the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution (1879\u20131902) and the second Director of the US Geological Survey (1881\u20131894).[67] He was the first to use the term \"Grand Canyon\", in 1871; previously it had been called the \"Big Canyon\".[68] In 1889, Frank M. Brown wanted to build a railroad along the Colorado River to carry coal. He, his chief engineer Robert Brewster Stanton, and 14 others started to explore the Grand Canyon in poorly designed cedar wood boats, with no life preservers. Brown drowned in an accident near Marble Canyon: Stanton made new boats and proceeded to explore the Colorado all of the way to the Gulf of California.[69] The Grand Canyon became an official national monument in 1908 and a national park in 1919.[70]"

        "content": "U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt visited the Grand Canyon in 1903. An avid outdoorsman and staunch conservationist, Roosevelt established the Grand Canyon Game Preserve on November 28, 1906. Livestock grazing was reduced, but predators such as mountain lions, eagles, and wolves were eradicated. Roosevelt along with other members of his conservation group, the Boone and Crockett Club helped form the National Parks Association, which in turn lobbied for the Antiquities Act of 1906 which gave Roosevelt the power to create national monuments. Once the act was passed, Roosevelt immediately added adjacent national forest lands and redesignated the preserve a U.S. National Monument on January 11, 1908.[84] Opponents such as land and mining claim holders blocked efforts to reclassify the monument as a U.S. National Park for 11 years. Grand Canyon National Park was finally established as the 17th U.S. National Park by an Act of Congress signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on February 26, 1919.[42] The federal government administrators who manage park resources face many challenges. These include issues related to the recent reintroduction into the wild of the highly endangered California condor, air tour overflight noise levels, water rights[85] and management disputes, and forest fire management. The canyon's ecosystem was permanently changed after the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963. Average flood levels dropped from 85,000 to 8,000 cubic ft/sec. In the absence of natural flooding, sandbars and beaches eroded and invasive species began to displace native species. Federal officials started releasing floods in the Grand Canyon in hopes of restoring its ecosystem beginning with 1996, 2004, and 2008.[7][86]\nIn 2018, the Department of Interior started experimenting with \u201cadaptive management\u201d of the Glen Canyon Dam, using a High-Flow Experiment (HFE) water release to shift volumes of sand and monitoring effects such as the dispersal of invasive tamarisk seeds.[87]\nHowever, as of 2022, extreme drought has caused water levels in Lake Powell to drop so much that a planned release of water has been delayed, to ensure that the Glen Canyon Dam can continue to generate hydropower.[88] Between 2003 and 2011, 2,215 mining claims had been requested that are adjacent to the canyon, including claims for uranium mines.[89] Critics of uranium mining are concerned that uranium will leach into the aquifers feeding the Colorado River and contaminate the water supply for up to 18 million people.[89] In 2009, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar published a Notice of Intent to suspend approvals for new uranium mining in the area.[90] In 2012, Salazar established a 20-year moratorium (known as the \"Northern Arizona Withdrawal\") withdrawing 1\u00a0million acres (4,000\u00a0km2) from the permitting process for uranium and hardrock mining, stating \"People from all over the country and around the world come to visit the Grand Canyon. Numerous American Indian tribes regard this magnificent icon as a sacred place and millions of people in the Colorado River Basin depend on the river for drinking water, irrigation, industrial and environmental use.\"[91] However, Salazar's 20-year moratorium on new mines still allows mines with previous authorization to operate.[91] Multiple challenges have been brought into court both against the moratorium and against the operation of uranium mines in the area.[92] The federal government's 2012 moratorium was upheld by the U.S. District Court for Arizona in 2014, but appealed in November 2014 as National Mining Association v. Jewell (No. 14-17350).[93] The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals again upheld the moratorium in 2017, stating that the Secretary of the Interior held valid withdrawal authority.[90] Havasupai Tribe v. Provencio was also argued at multiple court levels based on multiple grounds. The Havasupai people and the Grand Canyon Trust sought to block the reopening of the Pinyon Plain Mine (formerly Canyon Uranium Mine). Activity at the mine had ceased in 1992, ten years prior to the moratorium on new development in 2012. Appellants challenged the U.S. Forest Service's consultation process for approving reopening of the mine. As of February 22, 2022, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the arguments in No. 20-16401, concluding that the Forest Service had not acted arbitrarily in making its decision.[94][95] A study examining samples of groundwater from 180 spring sites and 26 wells in the Grand Canyon region has assessed the presence of uranium in groundwater from September 1, 1981, to October 7, 2020. The goal of the study was to establish a baseline assessment of groundwater conditions in the Grand Canyon region. At 95% of sites, maximum observed uranium concentrations were below the EPA's Maximum Contaminant Level for drinking water, 30\u00a0\u03bcg/L. At 86% of sites, uranium concentrations were below the Canadian level for protection of freshwater aquatic life, 15\u00a0\u03bcg/L.[96] On August 8, 2023, it was announced that U.S. President Joe Biden will designate Baaj Nwaavjo I\u2019tah Kukveni \u2013 Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument, a move aimed at conserving nearly 1 million acres of greater Grand Canyon landscape.[97]"

The forested rims are high enough to receive winter snowfall, but along the Colorado River in the Inner Gorge, temperatures are similar to those found in Tucson and other low elevation desert locations in Arizona. Conditions in the Grand Canyon region are generally dry, but substantial precipitation occurs twice annually, during seasonal pattern shifts in winter (when Pacific storms usually deliver widespread, moderate rain and high-elevation snow to the region from the west) and in late summer (due to the North American Monsoon, which delivers waves of moisture from the southeast, causing dramatic, localized thunderstorms fueled by the heat of the day).[108] Average annual precipitation on the South Rim is less than 16 inches (41\u00a0cm), with 60 inches (150\u00a0cm) of snow; the higher North Rim usually receives 27 inches (69\u00a0cm) of moisture, with a typical snowfall of 144 inches (370\u00a0cm); and Phantom Ranch, far below the canyon's rims along the Colorado River at 2,500 feet (760\u00a0m) gets just 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rain, and snow is a rarity. Temperatures vary wildly throughout the year, with summer highs within the Inner Gorge commonly exceeding 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) and winter minimum temperatures sometimes falling below zero degrees Fahrenheit (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) along the canyon's rims.[108] Visitors are often surprised by these potentially extreme conditions, and this, along with the high altitude of the canyon's rims, can lead to unpleasant side effects such as dehydration, sunburn, and hypothermia. Weather conditions can greatly affect hiking and canyon exploration, and visitors should obtain accurate forecasts because of hazards posed by exposure to extreme temperatures, winter storms and late summer monsoons. While the park service posts weather information at gates and visitor centers, this is a rough approximation only, and should not be relied upon for trip planning. For accurate weather in the canyon, hikers should consult the National Weather Service's NOAA weather radio or the official National Weather Service website.[109] The National Weather Service has had a cooperative station on the South Rim since 1903. The record high temperature on the South Rim was 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) on June 26, 1974, and the record low temperature was \u221220\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 1, 1919, February 1, 1985, and December 23, 1990.[110][111][112]"

        "content": "As of 1999[update] the Grand Canyon area had some of the cleanest air in the United States.[114]:\u200ap.5-2\u200a[115]\nHowever, air quality in the area can be affected by air pollution from coal-fired power plants, mining, oil and gas, vehicles, and urban and industrial pollution from nearby states, California and Mexico.[116][117][118] Events such as forest fires and dust storms in the Southwest can have a considerable impact.[119] Differences in visibility tend to be seasonal: best during the winter and poorest during the summer.[120]\nWinter cold fronts tend to carry clean, crisp air from the northwest, a less populated area. However they can also carry pollution from nearby mines and power plants. The average visibility during the winter is 160 miles, with the potential to reach 210 miles under ideal conditions. In the summer, prevailing winds from the southwest carry pollution from major urban and industrial centers, and visibility on average is only 100 miles. Within the canyon itself, smog can be trapped.[121] Air quality and visibility in the canyon are affected mainly by sulfates, soils, and organics. The sulfates largely result from urban emissions in southern California, borne on the prevailing westerly winds throughout much of the year, and emissions from Arizona's copper smelter region, borne on southerly or southeasterly winds during the monsoon. Airborne soils originate with windy conditions and road dust. Organic particles result from vehicle emissions, long-range transport from urban areas, and forest fires, as well as from VOCs emitted by vegetation in the surrounding forests. Nitrates, carried in from urban areas, stationary sources, and vehicle emissions; as well as black carbon from forest fires and vehicle emissions, also contribute to a lesser extent.[115][122]:\u200a26,\u200a49\u201351 A number of actions have been taken to preserve and further improve air quality and visibility at the canyon.\nIn 1990, amendments to the Clean Air Act established the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission (GCVTC) to advise the US EPA on strategies for protecting visual air quality on the Colorado Plateau. The GCVTC released its final report in 1996 and initiated the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP), a partnership of state, tribal and federal agencies to help coordinate the implementation of the commission's recommendations.[123][124] In 1999, the Regional Haze Rule established a goal of restoring visibility in national parks and wilderness areas (Class 1 areas), such as the Grand Canyon, to natural background levels by 2064. Subsequent revisions to the rule provide specific requirements for making reasonable progress toward that goal.[125] In the early 1990s, studies indicated that emissions of SO2, a sulfate precursor, from the Navajo Generating Station affected visibility in the canyon, mainly in the winter.[126]:\u200ap.C-2,\u200aC-6\u200a\nAs a result, scrubbers were added to the plant's three units in 1997 through 1999 to reduce SO2 emissions by 90% on an annual average.[127] Before and after observations showed a wintertime decrease of 33% for particulate sulfur (Sp), improving visibility.[128] The plant also installed low-NOx SOFA burners in 2009\u20132011, reducing emissions of NOx, a nitrate precursor, by 40%[129]\nThe plant shut down completely in 2019.[118]\nEmissions from the Mohave Generating Station to the west were similarly found to affect visibility in the canyon. The plant was required to have installed SO2 scrubbers, but was instead shut down in 2005, completely eliminating its emissions.[130] Prescribed fires are typically conducted in the spring and fall in the forests adjacent to the canyon to reduce the potential for severe forest fires and resulting smoke conditions. Although prescribed fires also affect air quality, the controlled conditions allow the use of management techniques to minimize their impact.[131][132]:\u200ap.86,\u200a93"

        "content": "Due to the increase of greenhouse gases, temperatures have steadily risen making recent years the warmest in the century-long record.[133] Temperatures have increased in Arizona by 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895.[134] From 1916 to 2014, naturalized streamflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin decreased by 16.5%, in spite of a slight increase of +1.4% in annual precipitation over the same period.[135]\nIncreases in temperature correlate to increased evaporation, loss of reflective snow, and decreases in snowpack, reducing available water in the Colorado River by an estimated 9.3% per degree Celsius of warming.[136][137] Over the last 30 years, the South Rim of the Grand Canyon has averaged 13.4 inches of rainfall per year, while the North Rim has averaged 24 inches.[138] The first dual distribution water system in the United States was built on the South Rim, treating and reclaiming wastewater for nonpotable reuse as early as 1926. Early on, water for human use was brought in by tankers, and pumped up from a spring deeper in the canyon.[139] In the 1960s, the Transcanyon Pipeline was built to carry water from the North Rim down into the canyon and back up to the South Rim.[140]\nEvery day 500,000 gallons of water are pumped from underground springs on the North Rim through the pipeline to supply the more heavily developed South Rim with water.[7][141] As water consumption continues to soar due to increasing visitation in the park, both the sustainability of the water supply and the condition of the pipeline are in question.[7][141] As of 2019, plans to replace the aging 16-mile aluminum pipeline were proposed.[140] Another proposal, from the Bureau of Reclamation, recommended that the park drill a well into the Redwall-Muav aquifer to meet the increasing water consumption. However, the aquifer's recharge rate stands to decline over time due to decreases in precipitation and snowpack.[142] Some effects of over pumping aquifers include land subsidence, reduction in rivers and lakes, disrupted riparian systems, and poor water quality.[143] In the National Park Service's \"Climate Action Plan,\" goals were set to reduce greenhouse gases 30 percent below 2008 levels by 2020 and plan and implement measures that best allow the park to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Strategies to accomplish these goals included: \"reduce [greenhouse gases] emissions resulting from activities within and by the park, developing and implementing a plan to adapt to current and future impacts of climate change, increase climate change education and outreach, and monitor progress and identify areas for improvement\".[133]"

North-facing slopes receive about one-third the normal amount of sunlight, so plants growing there are similar to plants found at higher elevations, or in more northern latitudes.[145] The south-facing slopes receive the full amount of sunlight and are covered in vegetation typical of the Sonoran Desert.[145]"

Along the Colorado River and its perennial tributaries, a riparian community exists.[144] Coyote willow, arrowweed, seep-willow, western honey mesquite, catclaw acacia, and exotic tamarisk (saltcedar) are the predominant species.[144] Hanging gardens, seeps and springs often contain rare plants such as the white-flowering western redbud, stream orchid, and Flaveria mcdougallii.[144] Endangered fish in the river include the humpback chub and the razorback sucker.[147] The three most common amphibians in these riparian communities are the canyon tree frog, red-spotted toad, and Woodhouse's Rocky Mountain toad.[148] Leopard frogs are very rare in the Colorado River corridor; they have undergone major declines and have not been seen in the Canyon in several years.[148] There are 33 crustacean species found in the Colorado River and its tributaries within Grand Canyon National Park. Of these 33, 16 are considered true zooplankton organisms.[149] Only 48 bird species regularly nest along the river, while others use the river as a migration corridor or as an overwintering habitat. The bald eagle is one species that uses the river corridor as a winter habitat.[150] River otters may have disappeared from the park in the late 20th century, and muskrats are extremely rare.[146] Beavers cut willows, cottonwoods, and shrubs for food, and can significantly affect the riparian vegetation.[146] Other rodents, such as antelope squirrels and pocket mice, are mostly omnivorous, using many different vegetation types.[146] Grand Canyon bats typically roost in desert uplands but forage on the abundance of insects along the river and its tributaries.[146] In addition to bats, coyotes, ringtails, and spotted skunks are the most numerous riparian predators and prey on invertebrates, rodents, and reptiles.[146] Raccoons, weasels, bobcats, gray foxes, and mountain lions are also present but are much rarer.[146] Ungulate species such as mule deer and desert bighorn sheep frequent the river corridor. Since the removal of 500 feral burros in the early 1980s, bighorn sheep numbers have rebounded.[146] Mule deer are generally not permanent residents along the river but travel down from the rim when food and water resources there become scarce.[146] The insect species commonly found in the river corridor and tributaries are midges, caddisflies, mayflies, stoneflies, black flies, mites, beetles, butterflies, moths, and fire ants.[151] Numerous species of spiders and several species of scorpions, including the bark scorpion and the giant desert hairy scorpion, inhabit the riparian zone.[151] Eleven aquatic and 26 terrestrial species of mollusks have been identified in and around Grand Canyon National Park.[152] Of the aquatic species, two are bivalves (clams) and nine are gastropods (snails).[152] Twenty-six species of terrestrial gastropods have been identified, primarily land snails and slugs.[152] There are approximately 41 reptile species in Grand Canyon National Park. Ten are considered common along the river corridor and include lizards and snakes.[153] Lizard density tends to be highest along the stretch of land between the water's edge and the beginning of the upland desert community.[153] The two largest lizards in the canyon are gila monsters and chuckwallas.[153] Many snake species, which are not directly dependent on surface water, may be found both within the inner gorge and the Colorado River corridor. Six rattlesnake species have been recorded in the park.[153] Above the river corridor a desert scrub community, composed of North American desert flora, thrives. Typical warm desert species such as creosote bush, white bursage, brittlebush, catclaw acacia, ocotillo, mariola, western honey mesquite, four-winged saltbush, big sagebrush, blackbrush, and rubber rabbitbrush grow in this community.[144] The mammalian fauna in the woodland scrub community consists of 50 species, mostly rodents and bats.[146] Three of the five Park woodrat species live in the desert scrub community.[146] Except for the western banded gecko, which seems to be distributed only near water along the Colorado River, all of the reptiles found near the river also appear in the uplands, but in lower densities.[153] The desert gopher tortoise, a threatened species, inhabits the desert scrublands in the western end of the park.[153] Some of the common insects found at elevations above 2,000 feet (610\u00a0m) are orange paper wasps, honey bees, black flies, tarantula hawks, stink bugs, beetles, black ants, and monarch and swallowtail butterflies.[151] Solifugids, wood spiders, garden spiders, black widow spiders, and tarantulas can be found in the desert scrub and higher elevations.[151]"

Also, several critically endangered California condors have made the eastern part of the Park their home, having been re-introduced to the Colorado Plateau on the Arizona Strip earlier.[150] The conifer forests provide habitat for 52 mammal species.[146] Porcupines, shrews, red squirrels, tassel-eared Kaibab and Abert's squirrels, black bear, mule deer, and elk are found at the park's higher elevations on the Kaibab Plateau.[146] Above the desert scrub and up to 6,200 feet (1,900\u00a0m) is a pinyon pine forest and one seed juniper woodland.[144] Within this woodland one can find big sagebrush, snakeweed, Mormon tea, Utah agave, banana and narrowleaf Yucca, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, dropseed, and needlegrass.[144] There are a variety of snakes and lizards here, but one species of reptile, the mountain short-horned lizard, is a particularly abundant inhabitant of the pi\u00f1on-juniper and ponderosa pine forests.[153] Ponderosa pine forests grow at elevations between 6,500 and 8,200 feet (2,000 and 2,500\u00a0m), on both North and South rims in the Transition life zone.[144] The South Rim includes species such as gray fox, mule deer, bighorn sheep, rock squirrels, pinyon pine, and Utah juniper.[145] Additional species such as Gambel oak, New Mexico locust, mountain mahogany, elderberry, creeping mahonia, and fescue have been identified in these forests.[144] The Utah tiger salamander and the Great Basin spadefoot toad are two amphibians that are common in the rim forests.[148] Of the approximately 90 bird species that breed in the coniferous forests, 51 are summer residents and at least 15 of these are known to be neotropical migrants.[150]"

        "content": "There are many viewing points on all sides of the canyon, with the most accessible locations inside Grand Canyon National Park and the Hualapai Indian Reservation. About 90% of tourists visit the South Rim from Arizona State Route 64, which averages 7,000 feet (2,100\u00a0m) above sea level. The South Rim houses two visitor centers, a geological museum, art gallery/bookstore, and other attractions near Grand Canyon Village. Further east along the South Rim is the Desert View Watchtower. Grand Canyon National Park also has a visitor center in an easterly area known as the North Rim, via Arizona State Route 67; the center and the road are closed in winter months.[156] On the Hualapai reservation, Grand Canyon West is the third major area with tourist services, about 125\u00a0mi (201\u00a0km) driving from Las Vegas and about 250 miles (400\u00a0km) by road from Grand Canyon Village at the South Rim.[157] The tribe opened the glass-bottomed Grand Canyon Skywalk in 2007, which has since attracted \"thousands of visitors a year, most from Las Vegas\".[158] Also at Grand Canyon West is Guano Point, which features a narrow peninsula surrounded on all sides by steep dropoffs. On the north side of the canyon to the west, the Grand Canyon\u2013Parashant National Monument has no paved roads and no visitor services. Rafting, hiking, running, and helicopter tours are also popular in the canyon area. The Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon is a 78-mile (126\u00a0km) race over 24 hours. The floor of the valley is accessible by foot, muleback, or by boat or raft from upriver. Hiking down to the river and back up to the rim in one day is discouraged by park officials because of the distance, steep and rocky trails, change in elevation, and danger of heat exhaustion from the much higher temperatures at the bottom. Rescues are required annually of unsuccessful rim-to-river-to-rim travelers. Nevertheless, hundreds of fit and experienced hikers complete the trip every year.[citation needed] Camping on the North and South rims is generally restricted to established campgrounds and reservations are highly recommended, especially at the busier South Rim. There is at large camping available along many parts of the North Rim managed by Kaibab National Forest. North Rim campsites are only open seasonally due to road closures from weather and winter snowpack. All overnight camping below the rim requires a backcountry permit from the Backcountry Office (BCO).[159] Each year Grand Canyon National Park receives approximately 30,000 requests for backcountry permits. The park issues 13,000 permits, and close to 40,000 people camp overnight.[159] The earliest a permit application is accepted is the first of the month, four months before the proposed start month. Tourists wishing for a more vertical perspective can go skydiving, board helicopters and small airplanes in Boulder, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Grand Canyon National Park Airport (seven miles from the South Rim) for canyon flyovers. Scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1,500 feet (460\u00a0m) of the rim within the national park because of a late 1990s crash.[160] The last aerial video footage from below the rim was filmed in 1984. However, some helicopter flights land on the Havasupai and Hualapai Indian Reservations within Grand Canyon (outside of the park boundaries). In 2016, skydiving at the Grand Canyon become possible with the first Grand Canyon Skydiving operation opening up at the Grand Canyon National Park Airport, on the South Rim. In 2014, a developer announced plans to build a multimedia complex on the canyon's rim called the Grand Canyon Escalade. On 420 acres (170\u00a0ha) there would be shops, an IMAX theater, hotels and an RV park. A gondola would enable easy visits to the canyon floor where a \"riverwalk\" of \"connected walkways, an eatery, a tramway station, a seating area and a wastewater package plant\" would be situated. On October 31, 2017, the Navajo Nation Council voted against the project.[161]"

Approximately 90 minutes later, the two propeller-driven airliners collided above the canyon while both were flying in unmonitored airspace. The wreckage of both planes fell into the eastern portion of the canyon, on Temple and Chuar Buttes, near the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers. The disaster killed all 128 passengers and crew members aboard both planes.

Owing to the Cold Springs Canyon Fire, the town of Mansfield was under \"evacuate now\" orders but all roads were closed.[3] Smoke blanketed the Seattle area on September 8 and caused unhealthy air conditions throughout the Puget Sound region, mostly from air spilling over the Cascade Range from Eastern Washington.[4][5] The smoke was noticeable in many parts of southern British Columbia, leading to air quality advisories in areas including Vancouver and Victoria.[6][7] Pearl Hill Fire began when the fire jumped over 900 feet (270\u00a0m) to cross the Columbia River into Bridgeport.[8] By the evening of September 8, the Cold Springs Canyon and adjacent Pearl Hill Fires had burned over 337,000 acres (136,000\u00a0ha) and neither was more than 10% contained.[9] The Whitney Fire near Davenport was 100,000 acres (40,000\u00a0ha) large by September 9, when it was 5% contained.[10] Pearl Hill Fire was 223,730 acres and over 90% contained by September 22; together Pearl Hill and Cold Springs Fires burned over 410,000 acres (170,000\u00a0ha).[8][11] Smaller fires in occurred in more populated areas of Western Washington. By September 9, the Sumner Grade Fire near Sumner closed Washington State Route 410, grew to 800 acres. Parts of Sumner and Bonney Lake were evacuated.[12]"

It was the eighth tropical storm, fifth typhoon, and third super typhoon of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season recognized by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, Saomai was the seventh tropical storm and fifth typhoon of the season. The name \"Saomai\" was submitted by Vietnam, and is from the Vietnamese word for \"morning star\" (sao Mai), a reference to the planet Venus.[2] The typhoon brought heavy rain and wind to areas of the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Taiwan, and the east coast of China. It was responsible for 456 deaths and $2.5\u00a0billion (2006\u00a0USD) in damage. Saomai affected many of the same areas affected by Tropical Storm Bilis a month earlier, and the China Meteorological Administration reported that Saomai was the strongest typhoon that ever occurred over China's offshore region as well as the most powerful typhoon ever to make landfall over Mainland China.[3]"

        "content": "A tropical disturbance formed east of Chuuk on July 31 and gradually increased in organization over the next several days as it moved northwestward. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system on August 4 and it was designated a tropical depression by both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) later that day. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 5, and the JMA designated it Tropical Storm Saomai. Saomai continued moving toward the northwest and passed over the Mariana Islands on August 6 while continuing to strengthen,[4] and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA later that day. The storm then began organizing and intensifying more rapidly, becoming a typhoon early on August 7. Saomai moved into the area of responsibility of PAGASA on August 8, and was designated Typhoon Juan. Due to Saomai's proximity to Tropical Storm Bopha, located near Taiwan, the two underwent a Fujiwhara interaction. This interaction served to shift Saomai's track slightly to the south and provided the system with in influx of moisture via southwesterly monsoonal flow on the backside of Bopha.[5] Late on August\u00a09, Saomai reached its peak intensity as it moved just north of Miyakojima. The JMA estimated it to have attained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 925 mbar (hPa; 27.32\u00a0inHg).[6] The JTWC estimated Saomai to have been a much more powerful system, ranking it as a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 898 mbar (hPa; 26.52\u00a0inHg).[7] Further, though less significant, discrepancies on the peak intensity of Saomai exist between the local warning centers for China. Both the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) estimated the typhoon to have been slightly stronger, stating peak ten-minute sustained winds of 215 and 210\u00a0km/h (134 and 130\u00a0mph), respectively. Similarly the agencies reported lower pressures: 915 mbar (hPa; 27.02\u00a0inHg) by the CMA and 920\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.17\u00a0inHG) by the HKO.[8] After passing to the south of Okinawa, Saomai turned westward and brushed the northern coast of Taiwan Island early on August 10.[9] The typhoon maintained its minimum pressure until it approached within 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) of the eastern China coast. On August\u00a010, Typhoon Saomai made landfall at Cangnan County in southern Zhejiang, still maintaining a small and clear eye. According to the CMA, the typhoon moved ashore with maximum sustained winds of 216\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph), and a central pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg). By winds, Saomai tied Typhoon Marge in 1973 for the strongest typhoon to strike mainland China; because Saomai had a lower landfall pressure than Marge, the CMA considered it the strongest typhoon on record to strike the nation, as well as a 1 in 100\u00a0year typhoon.[10] Saomai was therefore the strongest typhoon to strike Zhejiang, surpassing the previous record held by typhoons Rananim in 2004 and Typhoon Khanun in 2005. However, wind estimates for typhoons could be inaccurate for early typhoons.[11] Gradual weakening ensued as Saomai moved further inland, and it weakened into a tropical depression on August 11, dissipating later that day."

Military bases in northern Guam entered Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 1, meaning that winds of 50 knots or higher were expected within 12\u00a0hours. The rest of the island was placed under Condition of Readiness 2, meaning that such winds were possible within 24\u00a0hours.[12] Several bases were temporarily closed.[13] The Central Weather Bureau of the Republic of China issued land and marine typhoon warnings for areas of northern Taiwan in anticipation of Saomai's outer bands. The warnings had been upgraded from lesser warnings issued for Tropical Storm Bopha, which made landfall in southern Taiwan the day before.[14] Five flights in and around Taiwan were canceled,[15] as was ferry service. Hundreds of flights from Okinawa to the rest of Japan were also canceled.[11] In China, 1,001,000\u00a0people in Zhejiang and 710,000\u00a0people in Fujian were evacuated to shelters prior to Saomai's landfall.[16] Over 20,000 soldiers and police were mobilized to aid in cleanup and rescue efforts.[17] Officials ordered 10,286\u00a0ships with 35,282\u00a0fishermen to return to port in Fujian, while another 5,638\u00a0ships returned to port in Zhejiang.

Owing to the storm's relatively quick pace, its effects were limited in duration. Rota received the strongest winds, with gusts peaking at 88\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) at the International Airport while sustained values reached 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph). Lesser winds occurred on Guam, with a peak gust of 61\u00a0km/h (38\u00a0mph) measured at Andersen Air Force Base. Enhanced winds extended northward to Tinian and Saipan. Light to moderate rains accompanied the storm and accumulations were generally less than 76\u00a0mm (3.0\u00a0in); however, monsoonal flow along the south side of Saomai enhanced totals over Guam where 113.5\u00a0mm (4.47\u00a0in) fell. Only minor damage resulted from the storm's passage, limited to downed trees and power lines on Guam. Brief electrical outages occurred in Barrigada and Chalan Pago. Overall, damage in the region was estimated at $5,000.[21][22] Later, as with Tropical Storm Bilis a month earlier, Saomai's outer rainbands affected areas of the Philippines. Over 400 homes were destroyed by storm surge, and two people were killed. At least seven people were reported missing.[23] The core of the typhoon passed to the north of Taiwan, but the island still experienced heavy rain and wind that disrupted traffic and cancelled flights to and from Taipei. No serious damage or casualties were reported.[24] While in the vicinity of Okinawa, Saomai brushed the southern Ryukyu Islands. Miyakojima reported the heaviest rainfall in Japan, totaling 52\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in). Wind gusts in the region peaked at 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) at Shimoji-shima.[25] Waves of 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) in height were reported at Miyakojima, which caused \u00a5980,000 (JPY, $8,500 USD) in road damage.[nb 1][27]"

A station in Cangnan County reported peak winds of 245\u00a0km/h (152\u00a0mph), and a station in Fuding reported winds of 273\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph), which were the strongest winds on record in Zhejiang and Fujian, respectively. The latter value was slightly less than the 284\u00a0km/h (176\u00a0mph) wind report in Hong Kong during Typhoon Wanda in 1962. Fuding city reported gusts of over 144\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph) for about three hours, and widespread areas in Zhejiang and Fujian reported typhoon force winds, with a 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) diameter of 216\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) winds.[10] Along its path, Saomai destroyed about 54,000\u00a0buildings while causing widespread power outages.[11] There were 61,277\u00a0destroyed rooms and another 371,147 that were damaged, mostly in Fujian.[16] Most of the damaged houses along the path were generally masonry built, while newer towers fared better due to higher building standards.[11] The typhoon also damaged 244,900 hectares (605,000 acres) of farmlands, mostly in Jiangxi.[16] Saomai struck a less developed area of China, which limited insured damage to around \u00a5400\u2013500\u00a0million (RMB, $50.5\u201363\u00a0million USD). This was estimated to have been between 4\u20139% of the overall damage.[11] Damage was estimated at \u00a511.66\u00a0billion (RMB, $1.5\u00a0billion).[30] Overall, Saomai killed at least 441\u00a0people, although unofficial sources suggest a death toll of around 1,000.[11] The storm left nearly all of Zhejiang without power and cut half of all communication links. The heavy damage prompted officials to declare a state of emergency.[20] In Wenzhou alone, over 18,000\u00a0homes were destroyed, and 3,850\u00a0factories were forced to shut down. Also in Wenzhou, Saomai left over 213,000\u00a0people without clean water. 193\u00a0people died in the city. In Cangnan County, the typhoon damaged 450\u00a0schools, totaling \u00a525\u00a0million (RMB, US$3.1\u00a0million).[11] Rainfall across the state flooded 56\u00a0provincial roads and highways. Six people died in Lishui after being crushed by a landslide.[28] Throughout Zhejiang, economic losses totaled \u00a54.9\u00a0billion (RMB, $610\u00a0million), of which \u00a54.5\u00a0billion (RMB, $560\u00a0million) was in Wenzhou.[11] In Fujian, high waves in Fuding wrecked about 1,000\u00a0ships, killing hundreds of fishermen.[11] Most of the lost ships were in the village of Shacheng, where about half of the residents were left homeless. Some entire villages in Fujian were entirely swept away by the winds and rains.[31] High winds and rainfall destroyed 32,700\u00a0houses, including 10,000 in Fuding alone; there were also 80,000\u00a0damaged houses in the city. Economic losses reached \u00a53.1\u00a0billion (RMB, US$388\u00a0million), and about 200\u00a0people died in Fuding.[11] Also in the city, Saomai destroyed the roof tiles and the gate house of the 1,146\u00a0year old Ziguo temple, a local historical site. The monks in the temple had evacuated, and damage to the structure was estimated \u00a55\u00a0million (RMB, US$625,000), rendering it largely destroyed.[32] Damage in Fuzhou, also in Fujian, totaled \u00a5200\u00a0million (RMB, US$25\u00a0million). Province-wide, 234\u00a0factories or mines were forced to shut down due to the typhoon. Economic losses in Fujian totaled \u00a56.4\u00a0billion (RMB, US$795\u00a0million).[11] About a month after Typhoon Kaemi affected the region, Saomai caused additional flooding in the inland province of Jiangxi. There, the storm wrecked six reservoirs, resulting in \u00a5348\u00a0million (RMB, US$45\u00a0million) in damage.[11] About 35,000\u00a0people were forced to evacuate in Jiangxi due to the storm.[16] One person was washed away in floodwaters while inspecting damage, while another person was killed when a damaged building collapsed.[28] In neighboring Anhui province, flooding forced residents to evacuate homes.[11] 87 deaths were reported in Zhejiang, mostly in Wenzhou. Major highways in the province were flooded out.[28] Most of these deaths were caused by storm surge flooding in coastal fishing communities, such as Fuding. Eight of the deaths were caused by the collapse of a damaged evacuation shelter.[33][34] Strong winds and flooding destroyed 37,000\u00a0houses and flooded 380\u00a0km2 (94,000\u00a0acres) of farmland, and economic damage amounted to 6.3\u00a0billion yuan.[28][35]"

The city of Fuding provided \u00a5104.9\u00a0million (RMB, US$13.2\u00a0million) toward reconstructing, as well as \u00a55,000 (RMB, US$625) for each family.[11] The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies made an appeal for almost 6\u00a0million Swiss francs ($4.8\u00a0million, 2006\u00a0USD) to assist stricken families in the PRC. As of August 11, 2006, about 1.8\u00a0million Chinese yuan ($220,000) worth of relief items and financial assistance had been given to the victims.[37] The PRC government also allocated 120\u00a0million yuan ($15.2\u00a0million) for disaster relief in areas affected by Saomai and earlier storms. The funds were used to provide food and water for displaced victims and pay for the rebuilding effort in Zhejiang and Fujian.[38]"

Areas affected by the wildfires in 2019 included those that had already been burnt by wildfires during the summer of 2018. The fires have created many air pollution problems for the UK.[3] The causes of most of the fires have been attributed to much higher than average temperatures and drought conditions that have prevailed since the spring of 2018.[4][5] There were 137 wildfires larger than 25 hectares (250,000\u00a0m2) recorded in the United Kingdom in 2019.[6] This beats the previous record of 79 from 2018.[7]"

Emergency services also responded to several fires on Cornwall's Lizard peninsula thought to be caused by arson.[21] Later on the evening of 26 February a fire broke out on Saddleworth Moor in West Yorkshire, rapidly spreading across 390 hectares (960 acres; 1.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[22] The same night saw approximately 800 square metres (0.20 acres; 960\u00a0sq\u00a0yd) of gorse burn at Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, prompting almost 200 calls to the emergency services.[23] By the morning of 27 February both fires were brought under control, though Public Health England advised residents of communities close to Saddleworth Moor to remain indoors and close windows to avoid inhaling smoke.[22] Though there were no reported injuries at Arthur's Seat,[23] concerns were raised over the fire's impact on rare species living at the site, such as the bordered brown lacewing, whose distribution across the United Kingdom comprised just one other site in Scotland.[24]"

Fire crews remained on the moor for two days and a man was later charged with arson.[25] On 21 April a barbecue caused a second fire in the county to break out on Marsden Moor, a Site of Special Scientific Interest thirty-five miles away, drawing more than fifty firefighters to the site.[26] More than 280 hectares (690 acres; 1.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of moorland was affected, destroying more than \u00a3200,000 of habitat restoration work and imperiling the nesting sites of some species of birds, such as curlews, whose populations in the United Kingdom are considered under threat.[27] By 23 April the National Trust, the owners of Marsden Moor, reported that the fire had spread to cover 3,700 hectares (9,100 acres; 14\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and described it as the most substantial blaze to hit the area for years.[28] Other fires across England in late April included a series of twelve blazes over Dartmoor on 22 April, with eight crews battling burning vegetation spanning 7 miles (11\u00a0km).[29] A moorland fire near Tintwistle in Derbyshire was also tackled on the same day.[27] The evening of 13 April saw a forest fire emerge between Loch Bradan and Loch Doon in East Ayrshire, the source of which, while unknown, was suggested by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) to have been exacerbated by the recent dry weather.[30] Thirty-five firefighters also tackled a 100 hectares (250 acres; 0.39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) fire near Ballindalloch in Moray that evening, and helped by a helicopter waterbombing the area the blaze was extinguished by the afternoon of 15 April.[31] Emergency services were further alerted on 14 April to two fires in the Scottish Highlands near Kinbrace in Sutherland and near John O'Groats.[32] On 19 April the SFRS issued a wildfire warning and urged the public to abide by the Scottish Outdoor Access Code to minimise any further risk of fire formation.[33] That day a number of fires across moorland and grassland on the Isle of Bute were extinguished with no injuries.[34] A blaze covering 30 hectares (74 acres; 0.12\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) later broke out in Lochaber on 21 April, and flames took hold of grassland in West Dunbartonshire on the evening of 22 April.[35] A wildfire broke out in Knockando, Scotland on the 22nd around 3pm. It was described as 'one of the largest fires the UK has seen in years'. In the first day, the fire destroyed more than 25 square miles (16,000 acres). The blaze created a plume of smoke that could be seen from space.[36] By the 25th, firefighters thought they had tackled most of the blaze and left the scene. However, they were called back on the 26th when it was reignited. This further fire destroyed 50 square kilometres (19\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), as of the 29th. At its height, around 80 firefighters, two helicopters, 19 fire engines and specialist resources were called upon to help tackle the fire, which was on four fronts. At its height, around 80 firefighters, two helicopters, 19 fire engines and specialist resources were called upon to help tackle the fire, which was on four fronts. Additionally, the fire caused several nearby properties to be evacuated.[37] The fire was fully extinguished by 9 May.[citation needed] In Wales a series of grassland fires on the Gower peninsula were reported over three days to 15 April, causing local road closures and raising concerns over the potential ecological damage.[38] That evening two large grassland fires fanned by strong winds spread in Rhondda Cynon Taff and Rhigos before being extinguished the following morning.[39]"

A weak low pressure system developed in the Philippine Sea on July\u00a07, which became a tropical depression on the next day. The depression tracked west-northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm on July\u00a010. After turning more westward, Eli steadily intensified, and obtained typhoon intensity that evening. The storm attained its highest intensity of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) early on July\u00a011 before striking northern Luzon. After entering the South China Sea, the storm maintained most of its intensity as it approached Hainan, although agencies disagree on how precisely strong it was. After passing through Hainan late on July\u00a013, Eli passed through the Gulf of Tonkin on the next day before striking Vietnam, where Eli quickly dissipated. Heavy rains associated with Typhoon Eli deluged Luzon and resulted in mudslides surrounding Mount Pinatubo, which had erupted a year prior. Offshore, 10 ships sunk, resulting in a fatality, 19\u00a0rescues, and initial reports of 25 missing fishermen.

This prompted weak winds out of the southwest to persist at low latitudes, which eventually spawned a weak low pressure area that was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on the morning of July\u00a07.[2] On the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first classified the system as a tropical depression.[3][nb 4] After tracking to the south of Guam, the disturbance accelerated west-northwest and increased in organization,[2] prompting JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 11:02\u00a0UTC on July\u00a09. An increase in convective coverage then led the JTWC to declare the system a tropical depression seven hours later.[2][5] The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a010 by both the JMA and JTWC as Eli's convective buildup continued.[6][nb 5] The intensification trend persisted as the storm tracked more westward;[5] the JMA declared Eli a severe tropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC the same day.[3] Twelve hours later, the JTWC estimated at Eli attained typhoon intensity.[6] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a011, the JMA upgraded Eli into a typhoon,[3] with the JTWC and JMA also analyzing a peak intensity of 135 and 130\u00a0km/h (85 and 80\u00a0mph) respectively at the same time.[6] Shortly thereafter, the typhoon made landfall on northern Luzon. After entering the South China Sea,[2] the typhoon tracked west[5] as its forward motion slowed in response to Eli nearing the western end of a subtropical ridge.[2] Now tracking west-northwest,[5] data from the JTWC suggested that Eli maintained minimal typhoon intensity until it moved through Hainan on the night of July\u00a013,[2] though data from the JMA indicated that Eli was a weakening tropical storm during this time.[3] The JTWC downgraded Eli into a tropical storm while the system moved west-northwestward across the Gulf of Tonkin.[2] Eli made landfall late on July\u00a013 about 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) east of Hanoi,[5] with the JMA estimating winds of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph).[3] Eli dissipated over northern Vietnam on July 14.[2]"

Sixty buses in six town were set up in order to evacuate residents from vulnerable locations.[8][9] Officials evacuated 1,600\u00a0people from their homes in three central Luzon towns to escape avalanches of debris from Mount Pinatubo.[2] Torrential rains associated with Typhoon Eli alleviated drought conditions[10] but also resulted in mudslides in the Mount Pinatubo area of Luzon, where there were reports of three deaths,[2] including a 72-year-old man who died of a heart attack while being evacuated in Minalin.[11] Offshore, 10\u00a0ships sunk, resulting in a fatality, 19\u00a0rescues,[12] and initial reports of 25\u00a0missing fishermen.[13] Monetary damage was estimated at US$862,000 (\u20b122\u00a0million), with around half from crops, and half from infrastructure.[14] Fifteen homes were damaged and five were destroyed. A total of 1,027\u00a0families were evacuated from their homes.[1] Throughout the country, four people were killed.[12] The typhoon posed enough of a threat to Hong Kong to warrant a No 1. hurricane signal on July\u00a011, and this signal was upgraded to a No. 3 a day later before Eli moved away.

        "content": "Typhoon Haima, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Lawin, was the third most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2016. It was the twenty-second named storm and the eleventh typhoon of the annual typhoon season. Impacting the Philippines less than 3 days after Typhoon Sarika, Haima formed out of a tropical disturbance southwest of Chuuk on October 14, it developed into a tropical storm the next day. Steady strengthening occurred over the next day or two as it tracked westward towards the Philippines. After forming an eye shortly after it was upgraded to a typhoon, Haima began to rapidly strengthen and eventually became a super typhoon on October 18. It later attained its peak intensity as a Category 5-equivalent tropical cyclone before weakening slightly. Haima later made landfall in Pe\u00f1ablanca, Cagayan late on October 19 as a Category 4-equivalent storm. Rapid weakening occurred as it interacted with the landmasses until it entered the Southern China Sea as a weak typhoon. It formed a large ragged eye once again and remained steady in intensity until making landfall in China on October 21. It weakened below typhoon intensity and became extratropical on October 22. The cyclone drifted northeastwards and later eastwards before emerging over water again, but eventually dissipated by October 26. 19 people were killed by Haima, and damage totals were estimated at more than US$970 million. The storm forced several hundred flights in the Philippines, Hong Kong and China to be cancelled. Ahead of the storm, several shelters were set up in the areas near China by the government to adequate the affected people Flooding and storm surge affected many coastal areas, downing several trees and power lines, leading to power outages. Due to the damage caused by the storm in the Philippines and China, the names Haima and Lawin were retired from their respective name lists in 2017."

        "content": "During October 13, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a tropical disturbance, that had developed about 705\u00a0km (440\u00a0mi) to the south-southeast of the Anderson Air Force Base in Guam.[1] The system was located within a favourable environment for further development, with low vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures and its dual outflow channels being enhanced by a TUTT Cell located to its northwest.[1] During that day, the system moved north-westwards under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure to its north and rapidly developed a low level circulation center.[2][3] During October 14, the JTWC and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the disturbance as a tropical depression, while it was located within the Caroline Islands about 700\u00a0km (435\u00a0mi) to the south of Guam.[3][4][5] During that day, the depression\u2019s low level circulation center continued to rapidly consolidate, while bands of atmospheric convection built and wrapped into the center.[3] As a result, both the JMA and JTWC reported that the depression had developed into a tropical storm, with the JMA naming it Haima after the Chinese word for a seahorse.[4][6] Immediately after the JMA indicated that Haima had intensified into a severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on October 16, the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon because of improving banding;[7][8] six hours later, the JMA also upgraded Haima to a typhoon, approximately 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) northeast of Yap.[9] Tracking west-northwestward along a subtropical ridge to the north, Haima began to form an eye.[10] The typhoon entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility early on October 17 and received the name Lawin (hawk) from PAGASA, shortly before it deepened further with a sharply-outlined eye.[11][12] Later, an eyewall replacement cycle occurred, as microwave satellite imagery revealed a solid inner ring of deep convection with a secondary outer ring.[13] Haima completed the eyewall replacement cycle by the morning on October 18. At this time, the JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon.[14] Several hours later, Haima presented a highly symmetric and tightly wound spiral structure with a 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi)-wide eye. There was a prominent anticyclone feature to the north blocking the usual poleward outflow channel, but given the impressive appearance, the restriction to flow was apparently having limited impact.[15] Located in an area of warm sea surface temperatures near 30 \u00b0C, Haima reached peak intensity at around 18:00 UTC, with the central pressure at 900\u00a0hPa (27\u00a0inHg) and ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph).[16] That intensity made Haima the second most intense tropical cyclone of the Northwest Pacific Ocean in 2016, after Typhoon Meranti.[17] Simultaneously, the JTWC estimated one-minute maximum sustained winds at 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[15] As Haima continued approaching and interacting with Luzon on October 19, the core convection became elongated with another eyewall replacement cycle, leading to a weakening trend and a cloud-filled eye.[18] The JTWC downgraded Haima to a Category 4-equivalent typhoon with 1-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). Subsequently, the system made landfall over Pe\u00f1ablanca, Cagayan of the Philippines at 23:00 PST (15:00 UTC).[19] When Haima entered the South China Sea shortly before 08:00 PST (00:00 UTC) on October 20, the typhoon had weakened significantly but become larger.[20] Although Haima kept deteriorating gradually over decreasing ocean heat content, the system soon regained a ragged 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi)-wide eye. Environmental conditions at this time included increasing vertical wind shear slightly offset by good dual outflow channels.[21] Turning north-northwestward along the periphery of a subtropical ridge positioned to the north and east, Haima made landfall over Haifeng County, Shanwei in the Guangdong province of China at 12:40 CST (04:40 UTC) on October 21.[22][23] Several hours later, Haima weakened into a severe tropical storm owing to the rugged terrain, and the JTWC issued its final warning on the system.[24][25] The system further weakened into a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC and ultimately a tropical depression in the Jiangxi province at 18:00 UTC.[26][27] At around 08:00 CST (00:00 UTC) on October 22, Haima became extratropical and accelerated northeastward.[28] Emerging into Hangzhou Bay right before 20:00 CST (12:00 UTC), the low then entered the East China Sea and turned eastward.[29][30] The system developed into a gale-force low near the Tokara Islands early on October 23.[31] Tracking eastward south of Japan, the system weakened into a low below gale-force about 420\u00a0km (260\u00a0mi) east of Chichijima, at around 09:00 JST (00:00 UTC) on October 25.[32] It then wandered around the area and dissipated early on October 26.[33]"

Over 700 flights in and out of Hong Kong were cancelled, trading on the city's stock exchange was stopped on 21 October, and ferry services such as Hong Kong's famous cross-harbour Star Ferry were cancelled.

Late on November\u00a010, the typhoon reached its maximum intensity of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), as estimated by the Japanese Meteorological Agency. After weakening slightly, Mike made landfall in the central Philippines. The storm weakened considerably due to land interaction, only to briefly re-intensify on November\u00a014. Typhoon Mike turned west-northwest and later north-northwest, avoiding land interaction with Vietnam. Vertical wind shear increased, and on November\u00a015, Mike weakened below typhoon intensity. Early the next day, the storm passed over western Hainan Island, and degraded to a tropical depression that night. After briefly emerging into the Gulf of Tonkin, Mike passed over Northern Vietnam and southern China, where it dissipated on November\u00a018. During its formative stages, Mike passed just north of Palau. There, one person was hurt and around 90% of the banana and coconut crops were leveled. A total of 1,035\u00a0houses and 10\u00a0businesses were damaged. Damage on the island totaled $2\u00a0million, including $1.3\u00a0million in property damage. After striking the Philippines, the typhoon brought widespread damage and was considered the worst typhoon to hit the country since Typhoon Ike in 1984. In Cebu City, 88\u00a0ships sunk, the most ships ever sunk at the Cebu City harbor during a tropical cyclone. Power and phone lines were downed and the city lost access to drinking water for two days. Approximately 60% of all buildings were demolished and 28\u00a0people perished in the city. Nationwide, 748\u00a0people were killed while 1,274\u00a0others suffered injuries. A total of 1,900,000\u00a0t (2,094,390\u00a0short\u00a0tons) of sugar crops were destroyed. A total of 630,885\u00a0homes were damaged and 222,026\u00a0houses were demolished, resulting in 1,110,020\u00a0people displaced. Offshore, 159\u00a0vessels sunk and 28\u00a0others were washed aground and damaged. Monetary damage was estimated at $446\u00a0million (\u20b110.8\u00a0billion), including $46.1\u00a0million (\u20b11.12\u00a0billion) from crops, $350\u00a0million (\u20b18.52\u00a0billion) from public infrastructure, and $49.9\u00a0million (\u20b11.21\u00a0billion) from private infrastructure. At the time, Mike was the costliest tropical cyclone listed in the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council's database, and as of 2014, is the seventh costliest typhoon to strike the country since independence in 1947. Elsewhere, 68\u00a0people were killed in Vietnam, but no damage was reported in China."

        "content": "Typhoon Mike originated from a persistent area of convection that was first monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) early on November\u00a06.[1] At midday, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit.[2][nb 1] At 15:03\u00a0UTC on November\u00a06, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, after a rapid improvement in the system's convective structure and Dvorak estimates of T1.0/50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph). Following an increase in the storm's convection and an expansion of its outflow, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a07.[1] Several hours later, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm.[4][nb 2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a08, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Mike.[6] After becoming a tropical storm, Mike tracked west-northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge. The JTWC initially forecast Mike to track northwest over the Philippine Sea.[1] Later in the morning hours of November\u00a08, the JMA classified Mike as a severe tropical storm.[2] Shortly thereafter, Mike entered a period of rapid deepening, aided by two dual outflow channels and a trough to the northeast. Due to the formation of an eye, the JTWC declared Mike a typhoon at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a09,[1] with the JMA following suit six hours later.[2] Midday on November\u00a010, Dvorak intensity estimates reached T7.0/255\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) and satellite imagery indicated a 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) diameter eye and good upper-level outflow. Based on this, the JTWC raised the intensity of Mike to 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), making Mike a super typhoon. At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC increased the winds to 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph), marking a 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) increase in wind speed, or a barometric pressure drop of 99\u00a0mbar (2.9\u00a0inHg) in a two-day time period.[1] Early on November\u00a011, the JMA estimated that Mike attained its peak intensity, with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 915\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg),[2] while the JTWC stated that it had a mininum central pressure of 885 millibars (26.1\u00a0inHg).[7] After turning west-northwest in the general direction of the central Philippines, Mike leveled off in intensity. Land interaction took toll on the typhoon on November\u00a012 as cloud top temperatures surrounding the eye warmed and the eye became increasingly cloud-filled, coinciding with a weakening trend. Later that day, the typhoon made landfall[1] on the Cebu province,[8] with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of 225 and 160\u00a0km/h (140 and 100\u00a0mph) respectively.[4] The system maintained typhoon intensity over the island chain.[2][6] After Mike entered the South China Sea, the JTWC and many tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that the typhoon would strike into Vietnam, but this did not occur. Slight re-strengthening occurred over the open waters in the South China Sea.[1] On November\u00a014, the JMA reported that Mike reached a secondary peak intensity of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) while the JTWC estimated a secondary maximum intensity of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[4] The next day, Typhoon Mike turned north-northwest in response to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Increased vertical wind shear induced a weakening trend,[1] and midday on November\u00a015, the JMA downgraded Mike to a severe tropical storm.[2] Twenty-four hours later, the JTWC downgraded Mike to a tropical storm as its structure became less organized.[1] Later on November\u00a016, Mike passed over the western portion of Hainan Island, and after briefly tracking through the Gulf of Tonkin, Mike moved inland over Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh, Vietnam as a tropical depression. Overland, Mike rapidly dissipated;[9] both the JTWC and the JMA ended tracking the system on November\u00a018.[4]"

Hundreds of villages were also rendered impassable.[22] Twenty-five crewmen and passengers of the commercial vessel MV Dona Roberta were reported missing[23] after it sank from strong waves in the southern quadrant of the typhoon. Two sailors were also rescued.[24] Eighty-eight ships sunk at the Cebu City harbor, the most ships ever sunk at the harbor, eclipsing the previous record set by Typhoon Amy of the 1951 season. Of the 88\u00a0ships that sunk,[25] at least 12\u00a0were passenger ships and at least 3\u00a0were navy ships.[24][26][27] Rainfall peaked at 276.1\u00a0mm (10.87\u00a0in) at the port of Cebu City; this was the fourth highest total ever observed by a tropical cyclone in Cebu City. Furthermore, a storm surge of 3 to 4\u00a0m (9.8 to 13.1\u00a0ft) was reported.[28] Power and phone lines were downed and the city lost access to drinking water for two days.[9] Approximately 60% of all buildings were demolished[29] and 28\u00a0people perished.[30] Throughout the Cebu province, 40\u00a0fatalities were reported and 90% of all wooden homes were damaged or destroyed.[31] Elsewhere across the Philippines, six individuals perished due to drownings in the Leyte province.[24] Across Leyte island, more than 50,000 people fled their homes.[24] In the Negros Occidental province, five casualties occurred,[13] including three that drowned in 1.6\u00a0m (5.2\u00a0ft) floodwaters.[24] A total of 27\u00a0people perished in a landslide in Isabela.[31] Throughout Negros island, 35\u00a0people were killed,[32] with 61\u00a0others reported missing.[31] In six towns across the island, 9,500\u00a0people were evacuated to shelter.[11] Nevertheless, the typhoon's inner core spared Manila's metropolitan area.[24] A tornado was spawned by Mike near Cagayan de Oro,[24] which destroyed 160\u00a0houses[13] and left thousands homeless.[24] On Panay Island, seven people were killed,[32] including a 10-year-old boy that was hit by a tree.[11] Offshore, seventeen people, including six Americans, were rescued on an oil rig,[33] and sixty-eight other workers were evacuated.[34] Three bridges were crushed in Misamis Oriental, on Mindanao.[11] Three people died due to rough seas offshore Misamis Oriental.[35] In the nearby Surigao del Norte province, 32 people drowned.[36] Offshore Mindoro Island, six ships were run aground.[32] Another ship called the Iligan Flores was missing off the coast of Mindanao but there were no reports about the fate of the passengers and crew.[35] In the Bohol province, 20\u00a0individuals were killed while floods up to 5\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) high submerged roofs of cars and houses in the towns of Loboc and Loay.[37] Overall, 748\u00a0people were reported killed,[20] with an additional 1,274\u00a0people hurt.[38] Nearly 5.5\u00a0million people sought shelter[39] in schools.[40] Thousands of hectares of agricultural crops, including 1,900,000\u00a0t (2,094,390 short tons) of sugar crops, were destroyed.[9] A total of 630,885\u00a0homes were damaged and 222,026\u00a0houses were destroyed,[41] leaving 1,110,020\u00a0people homeless.[42] One hundred fifty-nine vessels sunk[43][44][25] and 28\u00a0others were washed aground and damaged.[45] Two-thirds of all damages occurred in Negros Occidental and Iloilo provinces.[38] Monetary damage was estimated at $446\u00a0million (\u20b110.8\u00a0billion),[nb 3][nb 4] with $46.1\u00a0million (\u20b11.12\u00a0billion) from crops, $350\u00a0million (\u20b18.51\u00a0billion) from public infrastructure, and $49.9\u00a0million (\u20b11.21\u00a0billion) from private infrastructure.[41] At the time, Mike was the costliest tropical cyclone listed in the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council's database.[39][46][47][48][49][50] However, this mark was eclipsed by Typhoon Fengshen in June 2008.

The health department sent 2,500\u00a0kg (5,500\u00a0lb) of medicine to Iloilo City for distribution to provincial health offices in affected provinces. The defense secretary ordered 150\u00a0tents to be airlifted to five affected cities. A total of 110 short tons (99,790\u00a0kg) of relief supplies were provided by the local government. Philippine navy vessels were utilized to transport rice from nearby island provinces.[38] As a result of the typhoon, authorities projected annual economic growth in the Philippines would be less than 2% \u2013 down from 2.3% earlier in the year.[58] The typhoon also prompted PAGASA to expand its warning system.[59] Typhoon Mike's damage to the infrastructure of Cebu forced local authorities to rethink governmental priorities,[1] where a food shortage was observed and water was rationed. Lines for gasoline and fuel was 2.4\u00a0km (1.5\u00a0mi) long.[60] However, the city quickly recovered, and by the end of the decade, it was experiencing rapid economic growth,[61] dubbed CEBOOM.[62] The United States provided $25,000 to Philippine Red Cross for immediate disaster relief needs. The United States Agency for International Development distributed 97\u00a0t (107 short tons) of food in Leyte and eastern Samar, and by November\u00a028, the country was granted $432,000 worth of supplies and cash. The United Kingdom provided $38,000 in medicine.[38] France loaned the country $36\u00a0million that was expected to be paid back within three decades.[63] Belgium provided $90,252 in relief assistance. Sweden granted nearly $18,000 worth of relief items. Denmark awarded $25,950 in cash. Germany added $132,450 in tents and medicine. Japan also contributed $400,000. Catholic Relief Services provided $25,000 in relief. Caritas Internationalis donated nearly $250,000 in cash. Save The Children contributed $10,000. World Vision donated $25,000. Within the United Nations, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and United Nations Development Programme offered $25,000 and $50,000 in emergency grants respectively. The United Nations Children's Fund donated $28,710 worth of medical supplies.[38] Due to the severity of damage and loss of life caused by the storm, the name Mike was retired and replaced with Manny.[64] PAGASA also retired the name Ruping, which was replaced with Ritang,[65] which was first used in the 1994 season.[66]"

It developed in the High Plains from South Dakota to central Texas on March 28, 2007, which produced most of the tornadoes. Several more tornadoes were reported the next three days before the system weakened on March 31. It affected western  Nebraska, western Kansas, extreme eastern Colorado, and much of Oklahoma, and Texas. It was the second major outbreak of 2007, four weeks after an outbreak farther east. The outbreak produced 80 confirmed tornadoes, with five deaths and extensive damage being reported. In addition to the tornadoes, widespread hail as large as softballs and destructive straight-line winds as strong as 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) were reported. The activity level was very uncertain for March 29, as it was conditional on the dry line refiring. Despite the squall line remaining intact, several more tornadoes developed. Several more tornadoes developed on March 30 and 31 before the system weakened."

        "content": "A powerful mid and upper level system brought terrifically strong wind fields aloft over the southern and central portions of the Great Plains region on March 28. This system was located over the Great Basin and tracked eastward into the central Rocky Mountains during this time frame. Ahead of the system, a dry line developed from a low-pressure area over extreme northeastern Colorado and the Nebraska Panhandle southwards into western Texas. Increasing south to southeasterly winds close and above the surface caused a progressively humid air mass to spread across the western portion of the Great Plains during the afternoon. Unseasonably warm surface temperatures and increased lift ahead of the approaching system supported rapid thunderstorm formations. This altogether allowed for the potential for large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes.[2] That afternoon \u2014 when the first signs of severe weather developed, tornado watches were issued from South Dakota south to Texas. The advancing dry line and the cold front moving eastward combined to produce explosive supercell development late in the afternoon. Early that evening, supercells containing severe thunderstorms and tornadoes was developed along a nearly continuous line from near Lubbock, Texas to Rapid City, South Dakota. Before the supercells reformed into a squall line late that evening, at least 63 tornadoes were reported, many of which were very large and potentially destructive.[3] Fortunately, the area is sparsely populated, preventing widespread death and destruction. Still, five people were killed.[4] On March 29, the squall line that moved eastward prevented a major outbreak during the daytime hours. Only a slight risk of severe storms was issued that day. Nonetheless, several tornadoes were reported, with two striking the Oklahoma City metropolitan area with almost no advance warnings issued before they struck. Significant damage was reported there with at least two people hospitalized when their RV was hit and four others injured during a tornado ten minutes later. Another moderate risk was issued for March 30, this time in south-central Texas into the Mexican state of Coahuila. This was later extended into northern Texas and south-central Oklahoma. At around 2254 UTC, one of the two tornado watches in effect in Texas during the day was lifted, although a watch remained in the state's central and northeastern portions. Later the day, the Oklahoma tornado watch was then extended into eastern Kansas. A moderate risk was issued for central Texas on March 31 with the storm line continuing through the state, along with Oklahoma and Kansas in a north-eastern direction. This outlook was later changed to a slight risk as the system continued on with a tornado watch in effect in south-eastern Texas. In addition to that, a thunderstorm watch was even in effect for Louisiana. The tornado watch was discontinued around 1504 UTC, although tornado warnings were issued in southeastern Arkansas. Later that day, the system reached the north-central United States. As a result, warnings were issued in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa. As the system continued moving in its north-eastern direction early thatevening, a watch was extended into the north-western portion of Indiana. The system weakened that evening and no tornadoes occurred afterwards; however, NWS officials later confirmed a microburst in the Illinois cities of Carol Stream and Glendale Heights in DuPage County just west of Chicago just before 10:00 PM CDT. Extensive roof and window damage was reported to buildings, including an apartment complex and a church. The damage path was about 0.5 miles (0.80\u00a0km) long and 250 yards (230\u00a0m) wide.[5]"

        "content": "The 2008 Borjomi wildfires started in the Borjomi Gorge, Georgia on August 15, 2008 and lasted for several days to come, destroying 250 hectares (620 acres) of the 75,000 hectares (190,000 acres)[1] Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park, one of the largest national parks in Europe.[2] The fire started in the concluding days of the hostilities during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, some 80\u00a0km far from the conflict area.[3] Eyewitnesses reported camouflage-painted helicopters in the sky just before the fire erupted.[4] Georgia accused Russia of bombing the area and deliberating starting a fire using incendiary devices, describing it as an ecocide. Russia's Defence Ministry denied bombing the forests and said that they would help the Georgians extinguish the fires if requested. Despite Turkish and Ukrainian aid, the firefighting efforts were complicated by the ongoing conflict and airspace restrictions.[5][6][7][8][9] According to the government of Georgia, \"the fire spread to over 950\u00a0hectares of forest land. An area of 250\u00a0hectares was totally destroyed, and 150 000 m\u00b3 of standing trees were lost. As a result, the forest's ecosystem lost its ecological function, as well as commercial value. In the affected area, endemic and other species were almost completely destroyed, including Himalayan yew, spruce, abies, pine, beech, oak, hornbeam and many varieties of forest wildlife.... The fauna of the region experienced significant damage as well.\"[10] The Borjomi wildfire alarmed international environmental organizations. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) called on \"all parties capable of helping put out forest fires in central Georgia to work together to extinguish them.\"[11] The PAN Parks network, of which the Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park is a member, sent a latter to the Russian Minister of Natural Resources, expressing its concerns that the \"recent bombing in Borjomi district resulted in a forest fire, which threatens Borjomi Kharagauli National Park.\"[12] The World Bank expressed its \"grave concern the reports of forest fires in the Borjomi area of Georgia\" and sent an assessment team in the area.[13] The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe-UNEP mission will also assess the damage caused by fire, including in the Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park and adjacent forested areas.[14]"

The hardest-hit region was Middle Tennessee, where several strong tornadoes devastated entire neighborhoods and left ten people dead. Some of the worst damage took place in Gallatin, Tennessee, and other communities north of Nashville also sustained significant damage. There were 73 tornadoes confirmed across 13 states, with the bulk of them coming on the afternoon and evening of April 7 across the South, particularly in Tennessee. In total, 10 deaths were reported as a result of the tornadoes, and over $650 million in damage was reported,[2] of which over $630 million was in Middle Tennessee.[1] It was the third major outbreak of 2006, occurring just days after another major outbreak on April 2. It was also considered by some[by whom?] to be the worst disaster event in Middle Tennessee since the 1998 tornado outbreak."

        "header": "Meteorological synopsis",
        "content": "The outbreak was caused by a powerful low pressure system over the Midwest that produced a powerful cold front, which tracked eastward across the South and combined with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico to form severe thunderstorms; with activity concentrated on April 7. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center issued a high risk for severe weather for both April 6 and 7, forecasting favorable conditions for an extremely strong tornado outbreak on both days. However, activity was not as intense as expected on April 6; only 12 tornadoes were confirmed, most of which were in Kansas. Several were damaging, but only a few injuries and no deaths were reported. The reason for the relatively modest level of activity was due to a more stable than expected air mass that day over the region, with lower dew points and less wind shear, despite the absence of a cap (which would have otherwise allowed a much larger outbreak).[3] Conditions changed the next day in the South as the system moved eastward, with the cold front entering a more conducive environment. The increased wind shear, combined with the high temperatures and humidity levels, produced tornadoes beginning late that morning and continuing throughout the day into the overnight hours. At 2000z, the NWS issued the highest risk possible for tornadoes, a 60% risk.[4] By the day's end, a total of 48 tornadoes developed. Several of them caused significant damage and loss of life. The worst tornadoes hit Middle Tennessee, where 10 people died.[5] In addition to the tornadoes, there were reports of hail as large as softballs, powerful microbursts and straight-line winds, and local flooding. Extensive damage was also reported in the northern suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia, when storms developed there overnight into the early morning of April 8. Despite a lower risk of activity on April 8, severe weather continued in Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia \u2014 mostly in the early morning hours, with another 13 tornadoes reported before the outbreak finally ended as the system moved offshore into the Atlantic Ocean. Over the three-day period, 73 tornadoes were confirmed, though the high number of overall tornadoes disguises the fact that most were weak F0 or F1 tornadoes."

A nightly curfew was required to combat the looting and maintain order in the community. There were a total of 23 arrests made. The United States National Guard was called in after the tornado hit to help with security and the removal of the excessive debris. It took 10 days for Volunteer State Community College to re-open after the tornado hit.[citation needed] The City of Hendersonville did not have tornado sirens at the time of the tornado, but the city installed some soon after the storm.[6] On September 26, the Greater Nashville Regional Council awarded the authorities involved in the recovery (including the municipalities of Sumner County) the Marshall S. Stuart Memorial Award for outstanding intergovernmental cooperation after the tornado. The quick response by other local authorities, counties and cities was congratulated.[1] On October 8, an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition featured a family from Hendersonville that had their home being rebuilt after it was destroyed by the tornado.[7] However, insurance issues plus personal injuries held back the recovery for many, and some neighborhoods have been slow to recover. Nonetheless, many homes have been rebuilt in the area.[1]"

The caption of its cover picture, showing Kraftwerk's Ralf H\u00fctter and Florian Schneider was \"New musick:  The cold wave\". That year, Kraftwerk released Trans-Europe Express.[6] The term was repeated the following week in Sounds by journalist Vivien Goldman, in an article about Siouxsie and the Banshees.[7] in which she wrote: \"the cold, cold wave breaking over your head, and for one second you don't know whether you're going to see daylight again\".[7]  In 1977, Siouxsie and the Banshees described their music as \"cold, machine-like and passionate at the same time\", and Sounds magazine prophecised about the band: \"[they] sound like a 21st century industrial plant [...] Listen to the cold wave roar from the '70s into the '80s\".[7] A scene of French, Belgian and Polish musicians, dubbed \"cold wave\", emerged between the late 1970s and early 1980s.[1] The French scene was also known as \"la vague froide,\"[5] which was a term coined by the French music press to describe the sound of the band Marquis de Sade.[8][9] According to Vice, the most notable acts were Marquis de Sade, Asylum Party, and Twilight Ritual.[10] Brave Punk World author James Greene cited Marquis de Sade's 1979 album Dantzig Twist as \"a classic\" of the genre. He also referenced KaS Product as a group that \"pushed cold wave to icier places in the early 1980s and ended up one of its preeminent voices.\"[11] Benelux cold wave artists and cassette labels communicated through an underground cassette culture; Alain Neffe's Insane Music label in Belgium was heavily active in European cassette culture. Schoolwerth also stated that Al Margolis of New York's Sound of Pig Tapes and Chris Phinney of Tennessee's Harsh Reality Music, who were active in the industrial/experimental music scene, were largely responsible from introducing minimal synth and cold wave artists to the United States.[8]"

In addition, there was the Forester and Fire Warden (F&FW) which is a chartered office \nof the County and was funded by the General Fund. The property tax rate for each district was \nconsiderably different.\nWith the property tax limitations and standardization of tax rates established by Proposition 13 in \n1978, there was no longer a need to maintain the separate districts. From 1986 to 1992, the F&FW \nand the CFPD were the two remaining legal entities that made up what is commonly known as the \nLos Angeles County Fire Department. In 1992, the CFPD annexed all the remaining unincorporated \narea in with a corresponding property tax transfer to fulfill the chartered responsibilities of the \nF&FW. \nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department has a very rich and unique history, which is full of \ninnovation, and daring accomplishments. From designing the 9-1-1 system and initiating a \nparamedic program in the 1970's to the current day Urban Search and Rescue and Homeland \nSecurity Sections, our Fire Department is a leader and model to fire departments around the \nworld.

It touched down there on Wednesday, July 12, 2006, and traveled 13 miles (21\u00a0km) into southwestern Connecticut during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EDT (19:30\u00a0UTC) on the shore of the Hudson River before becoming a waterspout and traveling 3\u00a0mi (5\u00a0km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered Westchester County and struck the town of Sleepy Hollow at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a one-quarter mile (400\u00a0m) in diameter.[1] The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EDT (20:01\u00a0UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of Greenwich at 4:03\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EDT (20:03\u00a0UTC).[1] When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.[2] Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1\u00a0million."

Daytime heating in the Tri-State Region led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of showers and thunderstorms. With conditions favorable for the development of a tornado, the Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch at 12:40\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EDT (16:40\u00a0UTC).[3] A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EDT (18:00\u00a0UTC) which produced a funnel cloud near Carlstadt at around 2:45\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EDT (18:45\u00a0UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.[4] That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into New York.[5] About 15\u00a0minutes later, a tornado warning was issued for southern Rockland and Westchester counties, which would remain in effect until 4:15\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EDT (21:15\u00a0UTC).[6]  At around 3:30\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EDT (19:30\u00a0UTC), an F1 tornado touched down near Grand View-on-Hudson along the Hudson River in Rockland County. The 100 yards (91\u00a0m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a waterspout as it took a 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the Tappan Zee Bridge before crossing into Westchester County.[5] Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.[2] The tornado hit the town of Sleepy Hollow, New York, around 3:37\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EDT (19:37\u00a0UTC); two minutes later, a 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared New York State Route 9A, it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to 157\u00a0mph (253\u00a0km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300\u00a0yd (270\u00a0m) wide[7] and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.[8] Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the Kensico Reservoir in Valhalla as the tornado neared the New York\u2013Connecticut border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km).[7] After crossing the state border into Fairfield County, Connecticut, it weakened further before lifting at 4:03\u00a0p.m\u00a0EDT (20:03 UTC) in Greenwich after traveling 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the Merritt Parkway.[9] Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of 13\u00a0mi (21\u00a0km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.[1]"

Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1\u00a0million in damage.[1] Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.[1] After crossing the Hudson River, the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of Sleepy Hollow, damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.[1] A 10-foot (3.0\u00a0m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.[8] Afterwards, the town of Pocantico Hills was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.[1] An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot.[8] A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off.[10] After a tornado warning was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.[11] As the tornado crossed New York State Route 9A, it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries.[8] Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of Mount Pleasant and Hawthorne, damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage.[1] Damage along the Saw Mill River Parkway prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant.[12]  Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting Metro-North Railroad service and creating major traffic delays.[11] After passing by the Kensico Reservoir in Valhalla, the tornado crossed into Connecticut,[1] where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county.[8] In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1\u00a0million.[7] The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of Greenwich. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures.[1] The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town.[13] Damages in the state totaled to  $2\u00a0million.[9]"

A recreational path in Tarrytown, New York, was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees.[17] Metro-North Railroad suspended trains on the northern part of the Harlem Line until 5:00\u00a0p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. Southbound passengers took buses while the tracks were shut down.[11] All trains were back on schedule by 7:00\u00a0p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).[15]"

The system peaked as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone before moving into the South Pacific basin, then rapidly degenerated into a subtropical low on 11 February 2023. Norfolk Island was placed under a red alert as Gabrielle approached, while heavy rain and wind warnings were issued across the North Island of New Zealand. Existing states of emergency in Auckland and the Coromandel due to recent floods were extended, and new states of emergency were declared in other areas. The cyclone impacted New Zealand from 11 to 17 February, with a national state of emergency being declared on 14 February 2023. All states of emergency had been lifted by 14 March.[8]"

Hundreds of police staff worked on locating people and every person uncontactable was finally accounted for on 7 March,[59][60] except for one man who disappeared north of Napier on the morning of 14 February and remains missing as of April 2024.[61] A man died in Australia on 27 June, with his family claiming that the stress after losing his home in the cyclone had detrimental effects on his health which he never recovered from.[62] More flooding later occurred in Auckland and Northland on 24 February as rain storms struck the North Island,[63] and weather warnings were issued for Coromandel Peninsula, Auckland and Northland.[64]"

Of this amount, NZ$275 million would be allocated to Waka Kotahi and local councils to repairing damaged roads, NZ$200 million to repairing railways, NZ$117 million to repairing damaged schools, and NZ$35 million to covering various health services including mental health, general practitioners and frontline health workers.[127][128] The New Zealand Treasury estimated that the total damage from Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland floods would cost between NZ$9 billion to $14.5 billion; with NZ$5 to $7.5 billion being related to infrastructure owned by central and local government.[127] A special Lotto draw was held on March 18 with 50% of receipts, or $11.77 million, going to cyclone relief.[129][130] On 3 October, Forestry Ministry Peeni Henare announced that the Government would tighten forestry slash practices to reduce the risk of damage to downstream communities in response to Cyclone Gabrielle. Under the new regulations, slash longer than two metres, with a large-end diameter over 10cm, must be removed after harvesting from erosion-prone land unless it is unsafe to remove it.[131] On 11 February 2024, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell announced that the Government would contribute NZ$63 million to aid the removal of sediment and debris caused by Cyclone Gabrielle in the Hawke's Bay and Gisborne District.[132]"

A range of figures and groups including the \"West Auckland is Flooding\" advocacy group, Victoria University of Wellington public policy emeritus professor Dr Jonathan Boston, former cabinet minister Phil Twyford, and University of Waikato environmental planning lecturer Dr Christina Hanna have advocated that the New Zealand Government and local councils encourage and subsidise residents and businesses to evacuate from flood-prone areas in New Zealand including West Auckland, Westport, South Dunedin, Christchurch's Southshore suburb, Lower Hutt's Petone suburb, and parts of Whakat\u0101ne, Whanganui or Whang\u0101rei.[138][139][140] In February 2023, Prime Minister Hipkins and Climate Change Minister James Shaw confirmed that the Government was incorporating managed retreat into its Climate Change Adaptation Bill and disaster response policies.[141][142] On 1 June, affected properties across the Hawke's Bay region were grouped into three categories in order to clarify the impact of managed retreat. Around 10,000 were placed under category 2, meaning they would need extra flood protections in order to be rebuilt, while around 700 properties were placed under category 3, meaning they would be unsafe to rebuild.[143] Most of the Esk Valley was placed under category 3. Voluntary buyouts were offered to impacted residents.[144] On 31 July, Cyclone Recovery Minister Grant Robertson proposed a cyclone recovery cost-sharing agreement with the Hawke's Bay Regional Council, Napier City Council, Hastings District Council, Wairoa District Council and Central Hawke's Bay District. This plan includes voluntary category 3 property buyouts, flood protection, and transport infrastructure repairs. In response, the five local councils confirmed that they would consider the Government's cost-sharing offer through a series of extraordinary meetings.[145] On 3 August, the five councils voted to accept the Government's NZ$556 million recovery cost-sharing package, which will be split on a 50/50 basis between the Government and councils. The package consists of NZ$92.5 million for category 3 property buyouts in Hawke's Bay, NZ$203.5 million towards flood protection for category 2 areas between Wairoa and P\u014drangahau, and NZ$260 million for repairing roads and bridges.[146] The Human Rights Commission's Chief Commissioner Paul Hunt expressed concern about the lack of local input in the Government's cyclone recovery cost-sharing agreement.[147]"

Developed at the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University under James H. Walker near Laurel, Maryland, the Tomahawk emerged in the 1970s as a modular cruise missile first manufactured by General Dynamics. The Tomahawk aimed to fulfill the need for a medium- to long-range, low-altitude missile with diverse capabilities. Its modular design allows for compatibility with a range of warheads, including high-explosive, submunitions, and bunker-busters. The Tomahawk can use a variety of guidance systems, including GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain contour matching. Over a dozen variants and upgraded versions have been developed since the original design, including air-, sub-, and ground-launched configurations with both conventional and nuclear armaments.  The Tomahawk's manufacturing history has seen several transitions. General Dynamics served as the sole supplier in the 1970s. From 1992 until 1994, McDonnell Douglas was the sole supplier of Tomahawks, producing Block II and Block III versions and remanufacturing many Tomahawks to Block III specifications.[12] In 1994, Hughes Aircraft, having purchased General Dynamics' missile division in 1992, outbid McDonnell Douglas to become the sole supplier of Tomahawks.[13][14] A joint venture between Hughes and Raytheon manufactured the missile from 1995 until Raytheon's acquisition of Hughes in 1997, solidifying their position as the sole supplier.[15][16] In 2016, the US Department of Defense purchased 149 Tomahawk Block IV missiles for $202.3 million.[3] As of 2024[update], Raytheon remains the sole manufacturer of non-nuclear, sea-launched Tomahawk variants.[17]"

        "content": "A major improvement to the Tomahawk is network-centric warfare-capabilities, using data from multiple sensors (aircraft, UAVs, satellites, foot soldiers, tanks, ships) to find its target. It will also be able to send data from its sensors to these platforms. Tomahawk Block II variants were all tested during January 1981 to October 1983. Deployed in 1984, some of the improvements included: an improved booster rocket, cruise missile radar altimeter, and navigation through the Digital Scene Matching Area Corellator (DSMAC).[citation needed] DSMAC was a highly accurate rudimentary AI which allowed early low power computers to navigate and precisely target objectives using cameras on board the missile. With its ability to visually identify and aim directly at a target, it was more accurate than weapons using estimated GPS coordinates. Due to the very limited computer power of the day, DSMAC did not directly evaluate the maps, but instead would compute contrast maps and then combine multiple maps into a buffer, then compare the average of those combined images to determine if it was similar to the data in its small memory system. The data for the flight path was very low resolution in order to free up memory to be used for high resolution data about the target area. The guidance data was computed by a mainframe computer which took spy satellite photos and estimated what the terrain would appear like during low level flight. Since this data would not match the real terrain exactly, and since terrain changes seasonally and with changes in light quality, DSMAC would filter out differences between maps and use the remaining similar sections in order to find its location regardless of changes in how the ground appeared. It also had an extremely bright strobe light it could use to illuminate the ground for fractions of a second in order to find its position at night, and was able to take the difference in ground appearance into account.[23] Tomahawk Block III introduced in 1993 added time-of-arrival control and improved accuracy for Digital Scene Matching Area Correlator (DSMAC) and jam-resistant GPS, smaller, lighter WDU-36 warhead, engine improvements and extended missile's range.[22][24] Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS) takes advantage of a loitering feature in the missile's flight path and allows commanders to redirect the missile to an alternative target, if required. It can be reprogrammed in-flight to attack predesignated targets with GPS coordinates stored in its memory or to any other GPS coordinates. Also, the missile can send data about its status back to the commander. It entered service with the US Navy in late 2004. The Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS) added the capability for limited mission planning on board the firing unit (FRU).[25] Tomahawk Block IV introduced in 2006 adds the strike controller which can change the missile in flight to one of 15 preprogrammed alternate targets or redirect it to a new target. This targeting flexibility includes the capability to loiter over the battlefield awaiting a more critical target. The missile can also transmit battle damage indication imagery and missile health and status messages via the two-way satellite data link. Firing platforms now have the capability to plan and execute GPS-only missions. Block IV also has an improved anti-jam GPS receiver for enhanced mission performance.\nBlock IV includes Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS), and Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S).[26][27][28] On 16 August 2010, the Navy completed the first live test of the Joint Multi-Effects Warhead System (JMEWS), a new warhead designed to give the Tomahawk the same blast-fragmentation capabilities while introducing enhanced penetration capabilities in a single warhead.  In the static test, the warhead detonated and created a hole large enough for the follow-through element to completely penetrate the concrete target.[29] In February 2014, US Central Command sponsored development and testing of the JMEWS, analyzing the ability of the programmable warhead to integrate onto the Block IV Tomahawk, giving the missile bunker buster effects to better penetrate hardened structures.[30] In 2012, the USN studied applying Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) technology into the Tactical Tomahawk.[31] In 2014, Raytheon began testing Block IV improvements to attack sea and moving land targets.[32] The new passive radar seeker will pick up the electromagnetic radar signature of a target and follow it, and actively send out a signal to bounce off potential targets before impact to discriminate its legitimacy before impact.[30] Mounting the multi-mode sensor on the missile's nose would remove fuel space, but company officials believe the Navy would be willing to give up space for the sensor's new technologies.[33] The previous Tomahawk Anti-Ship Missile, retired over a decade earlier, was equipped with inertial guidance and the seeker of the Harpoon missile and there was concern with its ability to clearly discriminate between targets from a long distance, since at the time Navy sensors did not have as much range as the missile itself, which would be more reliable with the new seeker's passive detection and millimeter-wave active radar homing.[34][35] Raytheon estimates adding the new seeker would cost $250,000 per missile.[36] Other upgrades include a sea-skimming flight path.[37][38] The first Block IV TLAMs modified with a maritime attack capability will enter service in 2021.[39] A supersonic version of the Tomahawk is under consideration for development with a ramjet to increase its speed to Mach 3.  A limiting factor to this is the dimensions of shipboard launch tubes.  Instead of modifying every ship able to carry cruise missiles, the ramjet-powered Tomahawk would still have to fit within a 21-inch (530\u00a0mm) diameter and 20-foot (6.1\u00a0m) long tube.[33] In October 2015, Raytheon announced the Tomahawk had demonstrated new capabilities in a test launch, using its onboard camera to take a reconnaissance photo and transmit it to fleet headquarters.  It then entered a loitering pattern until given new targeting coordinates to strike.[40] By January 2016, Los Alamos National Laboratory was working on a project to turn unburned fuel left over when a Tomahawk reaches its target into an additional explosive force.  To do this, the missile's JP-10 fuel is turned into a fuel air explosive to combine with oxygen in the air and burn rapidly.  The thermobaric explosion of the burning fuel acts, in effect, as an additional warhead and can even be more powerful than the main warhead itself when there is sufficient fuel left in the case of a short-range target.[28][41] Tomahawk Block V was introduced in 2021 with improvements to navigation and in-flight targeting. Block Va, the Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST) which allows the missile to engage a moving target at sea, and Block Vb outfitted with the JMEWS warhead for hard-target penetration, will be released after the initial batch of Block V is delivered in March 2021.[42] All Block IV Tomahawks will be converted to Block V standard, while the remaining Block III missiles will be retired and demilitarized.[43] Tomahawk Block V have longer range and dynamic targeting with the capability to hit vessels at sea (maritime strike role). Raytheon is recertifying and modernizing the missile, extending its service life by 15 years, and resulting in the new Tomahawk Block V series: In 2020, Los Alamos National Laboratory reported that it would use corn ethanol to produce domestic fuel for Tomahawk missiles, which also does not require harsh acids to manufacture, compared to petroleum-based JP-10.[44]"

        "content": "Each missile is stored and launched from a pressurized canister that protects it during transportation and storage, and also serves as a launch tube.[45] These canisters were racked in Armored Box Launchers (ABL), which were installed on the four reactivated Iowa-class battleships USS\u00a0Iowa, USS\u00a0New Jersey, USS\u00a0Missouri, and USS\u00a0Wisconsin. The ABLs were also installed on eight Spruance-class destroyers, the four Virginia-class cruisers, and the nuclear cruiser USS\u00a0Long Beach. These canisters are also in vertical launching systems (VLS) in other surface ships, capsule launch systems (CLS) in the later Los Angeles-class submarine and Virginia-class submarines, and in submarines' torpedo tubes.\nAll ABL equipped ships have been decommissioned. For submarine-launched missiles (called UGM-109s), after being ejected by gas pressure (vertically via the VLS) or by water impulse (horizontally via the torpedo tube), a solid-fuel booster is ignited to propel the missile and guide it out of the water.[46] After achieving flight, the missile's wings are unfolded for lift, the airscoop is exposed and the turbofan engine is employed for cruise flight. Over water, the Tomahawk uses inertial guidance or GPS to follow a preset course; once over land, the missile's guidance system is aided by terrain contour matching (TERCOM). Terminal guidance is provided by the Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) system or GPS, producing a claimed circular error probable of about 30 feet (10\u00a0m). The Tomahawk Weapon System consists of the missile, Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC)/Afloat Planning System, and either the Tomahawk Weapon Control System (on surface ships) or Combat Control System (for submarines). Several versions of control systems have been used, including: On 18 August 2019, the United States Navy conducted a test flight of a Tomahawk missile launched from a ground-based version of the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System.[47] It was the United States' first acknowledged launch of a missile that would have violated the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, from which the Trump administration withdrew on 2 August after Russia broke it.[48] The United States Army has successfully launched a Tomahawk from the Typhon missile launcher.[49]"

The UK subsequently bought 20 more Block III to replenish stocks.[86] The Royal Navy has since fired Tomahawks during the 2000s Afghanistan War, in Operation Telic as the British contribution to the 2003 Iraq War, and during Operation Ellamy in Libya in 2011. In April 2004, the UK and US governments reached an agreement for the British to buy 64 of the new generation of Tomahawk missile\u2014the Block IV or TacTom missile.[87] It entered service with the Royal Navy on 27 March 2008, three months ahead of schedule.[88] In July 2014 the US approved the sale to the UK of a further 65 submarine-launched Block IV's at a cost of US$140m including spares and support;[89] as of 2011[update] the Block III missiles were on British books at \u00a31.1m and the Block IV at \u00a30.87m including VAT.[90] The Sylver Vertical Launching System on the new Type 45 destroyer is claimed by its manufacturers to have the capability to fire the Tomahawk, although the A50 launcher carried by the Type 45 is too short for the weapon (the longer A70 silo would be required). Nevertheless, the Type 45 has been designed with weight and space margin for a strike-length Mk41 or Sylver A70 silo to be retrofitted, allowing Type 45 to use the TLAM Block IV if required. Both the new Type 26 frigates and the Type 31 frigate will be filled with strike-length Mk41 VLS.[91] In June 2022, the UK announced it would be upgrading its Tomahawk cruise missiles to Block V standard through a \u00a3265 million contract with the US government.

The outbreak started with numerous supercell thunderstorms and severe squall lines developing in central Texas and southern Oklahoma, prompting the issuance of numerous tornado warnings, including multiple PDS tornado warnings.[4] An EF3 tornado caused considerable damage in Jacksboro, Texas while an EF2 tornado from the same storm caused a fatality in Sherwood Shores. Other strong tornadoes caused damage near College Station and in the Austin and Houston metropolitan areas. Severe and tornadic activity continued into the next day as the system moved eastward with numerous tornadoes reported in Mississippi and Alabama. On the evening of March 22, a supercell moved through the New Orleans metropolitan area, with an EF3 tornado producing severe damage in Arabi, resulting in one death and at least two injuries. Widespread flooding also accompanied the decaying squall line in Alabama. Tornadoes occurred on March 23 over the Eastern United States, associated with the same system, including EF2 tornadoes near Pickens, South Carolina, and Gladesboro, Virginia. In all, 85 tornadoes were confirmed."

        "content": "Signs for a severe weather outbreak became evident multiple days before it came to fruition. On March 19, 2022, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Day 3 enhanced risk for the areas encompassing central and eastern Texas and western Louisiana, as readings indicated that atmospheric conditions would become supportive for a damaging severe weather outbreak.[5] The next day, the highlighted area was slightly shifted to the west, covering central Texas, and a 10%, hatched risk for strong tornadoes was introduced, as discrete supercell thunderstorms were expected to develop in the area.[6] On the day of the event, the SPC upped the risk to a moderate risk, encompassing east-central Texas, as atmospheric conditions continued to become more favourable for severe weather. CAPE values reaching 1500-2000 J/kg placed themselves over a highly moist area, with 70\u00a0\u00b0F dew points present across south-central Texas. Additionally, a strong mid-upper-level jet of around 90\u00a0kn (100\u00a0mph; 170\u00a0km/h) overspread the area, further increasing the instability in the atmosphere. As such, the SPC increased the size of the 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes, and introduced a small 15%, hatched corridor for strong tornadoes to occur, along east-central Texas.[7] As the evening progressed, and the atmospheric conditions for a major event to take place kept improving, the SPC issued its first tornado watch, spreading from extreme southern Oklahoma, all the way to the San Antonio area, discussing the elevated probabilities for supercells and tornadoes to occur.[8] Multiple supercells soon formed inside and outside the concern area. A powerful supercell developed just outside the main risk area, producing a strong, long-tracked EF3 tornado, that caused considerable damage in the town of Jacksboro, Texas.[9] An EF2 tornado in Sherwood Shores, Texas caused major damage, killed one person and injured several others. The same storm also produced an EF1 tornado that caused significant damage in Kingston, Oklahoma.[10] As the evening rolled in, a squadron of powerful tornadic cells formed in the southern and central portions of the watch area. These cells soon became discrete in nature, and their isolation allowed for them to increase in intensity and coverage. Soon, multiple Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado warnings were issued from these supercells, as large and intense tornadoes were reported near Austin, Jarrell, and Elgin, Texas. A tornado hit a tower camera belonging to Austin ABC affiliate KVUE as it hit the Kalahari Resorts water park in Round Rock, Texas.[11] A long-track supercell spawned several tornadoes, including multiple strong EF2 tornadoes, in College Station, Madisonville, Crockett, Alto, Mount Enterprise and Carthage, causing multiple injuries and damaging structures. The EF2 tornado that caused major damage in the Crockett area resulted in a fatality.[12]"

Moderate instability, were CAPE values of around 1500-2000 J/kg were present over central Louisiana and western Mississippi, interacted with 400m2/s2 helicity values and strong wind shear, creating a highly favorable environment for severe weather to develop. At dawn on March 22, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk encompassing central Louisiana and western Mississippi, and a large 15% hatched probability for tornadoes was introduced, as multiple sustained supercells were expected to develop in the area.[13] In anticipation to the formation of a long squall line with embedded supercell structures in northern Louisiana and western Mississippi, the SPC issued a tornado watch for the area, discussing the moderate probabilities for intense tornadoes to form.[14] It was the first of multiple watches to be issued that day. As the line of storms progressed, multiple tornadoes were spawned from imbedded circulations within the line, some of which were strong. However, as the evening advanced, a long line of defined supercells developed on central Mississippi, soon becoming tornadic. Multiple tornadoes were reported from this line, including several strong EF2 tornadoes and an EF3 tornado. In Louisiana, a line of intense supercells formed in the late evening hours, and would go on to spawn the most notable tornadoes of the day. An intense high-end EF3 tornado caused considerable damage in the eastern New Orleans neighborhoods, as it was widely captured on video from multiple angles. The most severe damage was in Arabi, where several homes were destroyed. One person was killed and several other were injured. Multiple PDS tornado warnings were issued by the adjacent supercells, as additional tornadoes were spawned by the storms in central Louisiana.[15]"

The area first outlined was a 15% contour from the Florida Panhandle northeastward into Central Alabama and Central Georgia in a Day 7 outlook issued on March 17. Other than an extension into\nCentral South Carolina, this area did not significantly change until March 20, when the Day 4 outlook for this day significantly expanded to southeastern Virginia southwestward in northern Florida and Alabama was mostly eliminated. Virginia would eventually be removed from this area, but a slight risk covered the rest of the area in the Day 3 and Day 2 outlooks. Additionally, a marginal risk extended into the Great Lakes region and the 17:30 UTC Day 2 outlook added a slight risk to the Ohio Valley. These areas were refined on March 23, and all hazards were expected. The line of storms that had moved through the Gulf Coast the previous night produced isolated wind damage and a weak tornado in the Florida Panhandle and Georgia. Farther north in the Ohio Valley, multiple severe thunderstorms, including supercells, formed at moved northeastward, producing scattered wind damage and hail. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in Ohio. The most significant area of tornadoes occurred when a small cluster of supercells formed of the higher terrain in the Western Carolinas that evening. Wind damage and tornadoes, two of which were rated EF2, touched down in this area, as well as southwestern Virginia. The storms weakened below severe limits that night. An isolated severe threat was expected the next day across most of the southeastern coast, but no reports came in, as the storm system exited completely into the Atlantic.[16]"

        "content": "On March 22, a strong tornado touched down and moved through the New Orleans metropolitan area, originating in Gretna in Jefferson Parish at 7:21\u00a0p.m. CDT (00:21 UTC). The tornado began near Manhattan Boulevard and damaged some traffic lights. As it crossed Hero Drive and Claire Avenue, homes sustained minor roof damage and broken windows. A parked van was moved slightly, while fencing and tree limbs were downed. Minor damage continued as it moved through Gretna Park and across Mason Street and Creagan Avenue, where patio furniture and trees were damaged, and homes sustained minor damage to roofs, garages, and carports. The tornado then moved through parts of Terrytown, where homes and businesses had roofing material blown off. Additional damage occurred as the tornado crossed into the Algiers area of Orleans Parish. It moved across General Meyer Avenue and Patterson Drive in Algiers before it was caught on video crossing the Mississippi River. Damage in Algiers consisted of downed trees and tree branches, along with roof and siding damage to structures. All damage in the West Bank area (Gretna, Terrytown, Algiers) was consistent with an EF0 rating. After crossing the river, the tornado intensified to EF2 strength as it moved into St. Bernard Parish and the community of Arabi, just east of the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans. The tornado was broadcast live on television by skycam on WDSU as it was passing through the area, exhibiting horizontal vortices and accompanied by power flashes.[120] Moving almost due-north through the middle of Arabi, the tornado caused a relatively narrow path of severe damage along the Friscoville Avenue corridor. Many homes in this area were badly damaged and sustained total loss of their roofs, detached garages were destroyed, power lines were downed, and trees were snapped. The exterior wall of an automotive repair business was blown outward, and a metal warehouse building that housed a brewery was destroyed. High-end EF2 damage occurred near the intersection of Friscoville Avenue and St. Bernard Highway (LA 46), where the La Vid Verdedera church was destroyed, cars were flipped, a strip mall was partially destroyed, and a small house was pushed off its foundation and largely collapsed. EF2 damage continued in neighborhoods north of St. Bernard Highway, where more homes had their roofs torn off and many trees were snapped or uprooted. Arabi Elementary School sustained damage to its roof and fencing, and a school bus was overturned at that location.[46] Continuing to the north-northeast at high-end EF2 strength, it then crossed into residential areas north of Judge Perez Drive (LA 39). Homes in this area had roofs and exterior walls torn off, and some were shifted off of their foundations.[121] The tornado intensified further as it crossed Patricia Street into the St. Claude Heights neighborhood in northern Arabi. It reached its peak strength at this location as it moved along Rose Street and Benjamin Street, where multiple houses had major structural damage or were destroyed. One well-built home that was extensively anchored with foundation straps was torn from its block foundation; it was pushed 50 yards (46\u00a0m) away and rotated 90 degrees, although the house itself remained mostly intact. Two other nearby homes were completely leveled and swept away, one of which was reduced to a bare foundation slab. However, due to construction quality, a rating above EF3 was not assigned. As a result, damage in this area received a high-end EF3 rating, with winds estimated at 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h). Numerous other houses in this area had total roof and exterior wall loss, with only interior rooms left intact. Homes that were farther away from the center of the damage path suffered considerable roof and siding damage, and many had their windows blown out. The tornado momentarily weakened back to EF2 strength within the vicinity of Sidney Street, and dozens of homes suffered partial to total roof loss along this segment of the path. At least one house had partial exterior wall loss, and another residence was shifted off of its foundation. A large RV was tossed and flipped over, and power poles were snapped as well. Just north of here, the tornado reached EF3 strength for a second time, and multiple houses had their roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed. A couple of poorly-anchored homes built on raised pier foundations were swept completely away, and debris was scattered throughout the neighborhood. The lone fatality from the tornado occurred in this area when a pickup truck was thrown against a tree, killing the driver. Some metal truss electrical transmission towers were significantly damaged along the bank of the Florida Canal as the tornado exited Arabi. The tornado weakened substantially as it moved back into Orleans Parish across Bayou Bienvenue and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, again causing minor damage consistent with an EF0 rating. Minor damage continued as the tornado crossed Almonaster Avenue into New Orleans East. A metal building sustained damage to its exterior, and some metal shipping containers were rolled into wooden power poles, snapping them in half. Several fences, trees, and tree limbs were downed, and more homes sustained mainly minor roof, siding, and garage door damage in the area of Read Boulevard, Chef Menteur Highway (US 90), Prentiss Avenue, and Coronado Drive before the tornado dissipated at 7:38\u00a0p.m. CDT (00:38 UTC) near Dwyer Road at Joe W. Brown Memorial Park, south of I-10. The tornado traveled 11.45 miles (18.43\u00a0km) and reached a maximum path width of 320 yards (290\u00a0m). In addition to the fatality, at least two people were injured.[121] As a high-end EF3, this tornado was the strongest ever on record to hit the New Orleans metropolitan area.[122] An EF2 tornado would strike Gretna and Arabi just nine months later on December 14, 2022. Unlike this tornado, that tornado would cause significant damage in both communities. Six people were injured.[123][124]"

        "content": "This is an accepted version of this page  Paul Kenneth Bernardo (born August 27, 1964), also known as Paul Jason Teale,[2][3] is a Canadian serial rapist and serial killer dubbed the Scarborough Rapist, the Schoolgirl Killer and, together with his former wife Karla Homolka, one of the Ken and Barbie Killers. He is known for initially committing a series of rapes in Scarborough, Ontario, a district of Toronto, between 1987 and 1990, before committing three murders with Homolka; among these victims was Karla's younger sister, Tammy Homolka. After his capture and conviction, Bernardo was sentenced to life imprisonment and was declared a dangerous offender, thus making it unlikely that he will ever be released from prison. Following his conviction, Bernardo confessed to ten more rapes committed a year before the spree ascribed to the Scarborough Rapist. Homolka was given a lighter sentence in exchange for testifying against Bernardo as part of a controversial plea bargain; she was released from prison in 2005."

        "content": "Paul Bernardo was born in Scarborough, Ontario, near Toronto, on August 27, 1964, the third and youngest child of Kenneth Walter Bernardo and Marilyn Elizabeth Bernardo (n\u00e9e Eastman).[4] Bernardo's father often sexually abused his older sister, Debra, in front of other family members, and would eventually be charged with crimes involving voyeurism and pedophilia.[5] Bernardo's mother often withdrew from her family due to depression and agoraphobia, eventually moving into the basement.[6] Bernardo presented himself as being a happy and well-adjusted child despite his family's dysfunction, and was an active member of Scouts Canada.[6] Beneath the charming fa\u00e7ade, however, he gradually developed pyromaniac inclinations and dark sexual fantasies, one of which involved creating a \"virgin farm\" where he would breed virgin girls to rape.[5] After a fight between his parents in 1981, Bernardo, then aged 16, was informed by his mother that he was the result of an extramarital affair and that Kenneth was not his biological father.[5] Repulsed, Bernardo began to call his mother a \"slut\" and a \"whore\"; she reciprocated by calling him a \"bastard from hell\".[6] Later, after growing weary of Bernardo's domineering behavior, his first girlfriend left him for one of his friends.[4] In retaliation, Bernardo set fire to all of her belongings to which he had access.[5] Bernardo attended Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute and, in 1982, the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC), where another notorious Canadian murderer, Russell Williams, was coincidentally two academic years behind him.[5] As his day job, Bernardo worked for Amway, the sales culture of which deeply affected him.[7] Bernardo and his college friends practised pickup techniques on young women they met in bars and were fairly successful.[8] Bernardo delighted in humiliating his dates in public and engaging in aggressive anal intercourse in bed. His relationships became increasingly violent and unstable, and he threatened to kill his partners if they disclosed the abuse.[6] In 1986, Bernardo was served with restraining orders by two women after he made obscene phone calls.[4] In October 1987, Bernardo met Karla Homolka while she was visiting Scarborough to attend a pet store conference. The two shared an immediate attraction, as Homolka encouraged Bernardo's sadistic sexual behavior.[6]"

Investigators received two tips pointing to Bernardo. The first, in June, had been filed by a bank employee. The second was from Tina Smirnis, wife of one of the three Smirnis brothers who were among Bernardo's closest friends. Smirnis told detectives that Bernardo \"had been 'called in' on a previous rape investigation\u00a0\u2013 once in December 1987\u00a0\u2013 but he had never been interviewed\".[7] Bernardo frequently talked about his sex life to Smirnis and said that he liked rough sex.[7] Police interviewed Bernardo on November 20, 1990, for thirty-five minutes. Bernardo voluntarily provided DNA samples for forensic testing. When the detectives asked Bernardo why he thought he was being investigated for the rapes, he admitted that he resembled the composite. Reportedly, detectives found Bernardo more credible than Smirnis.[7]"

        "content": "By 1990, Bernardo had lost his job as an accountant and was smuggling cigarettes across the nearby Canada\u2013United States border. He spent long periods of time with Homolka's family, who liked him and were unaware of his criminal activities. Although he was engaged to Karla, he had become obsessed with her younger sister Tammy, peering into her window and entering her room to masturbate while she slept. Karla helped Bernardo by breaking the windows in her sister's room, allowing him access. According to Bernardo's testimony at trial, Karla laced spaghetti sauce with crushed valium she had stolen from her employer at an animal clinic. She served it to her sister, who soon lost consciousness. Bernardo then raped Tammy while Karla watched. After one minute, Tammy regained consciousness.[7][14] Six months before their 1991 wedding, Karla stole the anesthetic agent halothane from the clinic. On December 23, 1990, Karla and Bernardo administered sleeping pills to 15-year-old Tammy in a rum-and-eggnog cocktail. When Tammy lost consciousness, Karla and Bernardo undressed her and Karla applied a halothane-soaked cloth to her sister's nose and mouth. Karla wanted to \"give Tammy's virginity to Bernardo for Christmas\"; according to her, Bernardo was disappointed that he was not Karla's first sex partner. With Tammy's parents sleeping upstairs, the couple videotaped themselves raping Tammy in the basement. Tammy began to vomit; they tried to revive her and called 9-1-1 after hiding evidence, dressing Tammy and moving her into her bedroom. A few hours later, Tammy was pronounced dead at St. Catharines General Hospital without regaining consciousness.[15] Despite being observed vacuuming and washing laundry in the middle of the night,[7] and despite a chemical burn on Tammy's face, the Regional Municipality of Niagara coroner and Karla's family accepted the couple's version of events.[7] The official cause of Tammy's death was ruled accidental, the result of choking on vomit after consumption of alcohol. After Tammy's death, Bernardo and Karla videotaped themselves engaging in sexual intercourse, with Karla wearing Tammy's clothing and pretending to be her. They moved out of the Homolka house to a rented bungalow in Port Dalhousie to allow Karla's parents to grieve.[16] In 2001, the magazine Elm Street published an article in which it implied that forensic evidence proved that Tammy's death was not an accident and that her sister had deliberately administered an overdose of Halothane. The publication described Karla as a \"malignant narcissist\" who was so incensed by her fianc\u00e9's attraction to her sister that she removed Tammy from his affections permanently.[17]"

        "header": "Leslie Mahaffy",
        "content": "Early in the morning on June 15, 1991, while detouring through Burlington to steal licence plates, Bernardo came across 14-year-old Leslie Mahaffy.[18] Mahaffy had been locked out of her house for missed curfew after attending a friend's wake. Bernardo left his car and approached Mahaffy, saying that he wanted to break into a neighbour's house. Unfazed, she asked if he had any cigarettes. When Bernardo led her to his car, he blindfolded her, forced her into the car, drove her to Port Dalhousie, and informed Homolka that they had a victim.[19] Bernardo and Homolka videotaped themselves torturing and sexually abusing Mahaffy while they listened to pop music. At one point, Bernardo said, \"You're doing a good job, Leslie, a damned good job\", adding: \"The next two hours are going to determine what I do to you. Right now, you're scoring perfect.\"[19] On another segment of tape played at Bernardo's trial, the assault escalated. Mahaffy cried out in pain and begged Bernardo to stop. In the Crown description of the scene, he was sodomizing her while her hands were bound with twine.[19] Mahaffy later told Bernardo that her blindfold seemed to be slipping, which signaled the possibility that she could identify her attackers if she lived. The following day, Bernardo claimed, Homolka fed her a lethal dose of Halcion; Homolka claimed that Bernardo strangled her. They put Mahaffy's body in their basement the day before Homolka's family had dinner at the house.[19] Following the dinner party, Bernardo and Homolka decided to dismember Mahaffy's body and encase each part of her remains in cement. Bernardo bought a dozen bags of cement at a hardware store the following day; he kept the receipts, which were damaging at his trial. After Bernardo cut apart the body using his grandfather's circular saw, the couple made a number of trips to dump the cement blocks in Lake Gibson, 18 kilometres (11\u00a0mi) south of Port Dalhousie. At least one of the blocks weighed 90\u00a0kg (200 pounds) and was beyond their ability to sink. It lay near the shore, where it was found on June 29, 1991, coincidentally on Bernardo and Homolka's wedding day.[20] Mahaffy's orthodontic appliance was instrumental in identifying her. Several days before Homolka's release from prison in July 2005, Bernardo was interviewed by police and his lawyer, Tony Bryant. According to Bryant, Bernardo stated that he had always intended to free the girls he and Homolka had kidnapped. However, when Mahaffy's blindfold fell off, Homolka was concerned that Mahaffy would identify Bernardo and report the couple to the police. Bernardo claimed that Homolka planned to murder Mahaffy by injecting an air bubble into her bloodstream, triggering an air embolism.[21]"

        "content": "During the after-school hours of April 16, 1992, Bernardo and Homolka drove through St. Catharines to look for potential victims. Although students were still going home, the streets were generally empty. As they passed Holy Cross Secondary School, the couple spotted 15-year-old Kristen French walking  home.[22] After they pulled into the parking lot of nearby Grace Lutheran Church, Homolka got out of the car carrying a map, pretending to need assistance. When French looked at the map, Bernardo attacked from behind and forced her into the front seat of the car at knifepoint. From the back seat, Homolka subdued French by pulling her hair.[23][7] After French failed to arrive home, her parents became convinced that she met with foul play and notified police. Within twenty-four hours the Niagara Regional Police Service (NRP) assembled a team, searched French's after-school route and found several witnesses who had seen the abduction from different locations. French's shoe, recovered from the parking lot, underscored the seriousness of the abduction.[23] Over the Easter weekend, Bernardo and Homolka videotaped themselves torturing, raping and sodomizing French, forcing her to drink large amounts of alcohol and submit to Bernardo. At his trial, Crown prosecutor Ray Houlahan said that Bernardo always intended to kill French because she was never blindfolded and could identify her captors. The following day, Bernardo and Homolka murdered French before going to the Homolkas' for Easter dinner. Homolka testified at her trial that Bernardo strangled French for seven minutes while she watched. Bernardo claimed that Homolka beat French with a rubber mallet because she tried to escape, and French was strangled with a noose around her neck which was secured to a hope chest; Homolka then went to fix her hair.[24] French's nude body was found on April 30, 1992, in a ditch in Burlington, about forty-five minutes from St. Catharines and a short distance from the cemetery where Mahaffy is buried. She had been washed and her hair was cut off. Although it was thought that the hair was removed as a trophy, Homolka testified that it was cut to impede identification.[25]"

        "content": "Homolka and Bernardo were questioned by police several times in connection with the Scarborough Rapist investigation, Homolka's death, and Bernardo's stalking of other women before French's abduction.[7] On May 12, 1992, Bernardo was briefly interviewed by an NRP sergeant and constable, who decided that he was an unlikely suspect despite his admission that he had previously been questioned in connection to the Scarborough Rapist. Three days later, the Green Ribbon Task Force was created to investigate the murders of Mahaffy and French. Bernardo and Homolka had applied to have their names legally changed to Teale, which Bernardo had taken from the serial killer in the 1988 film Criminal Law. At the end of May, John Motile, an acquaintance of Smirnis and Bernardo, reported Bernardo as a possible suspect in the murders.[7] In December 1992, the Centre of Forensic Sciences finally began testing DNA samples provided by Bernardo two years earlier. On 27 December, Bernardo severely beat Homolka with a flashlight, leaving multiple bruises. Claiming that she had been in an automobile accident, Homolka returned to work on 4 January 1993.[7] Her skeptical co-workers called her parents, and although they rescued her the following day by physically removing her from Bernardo's house, Homolka went back in to frantically search for something. Homolka's parents took her to St. Catharines General Hospital, where she gave a statement to the NRP that she was a battered spouse and filed charges against Bernardo. He was arrested, and later released on his own recognizance. A friend who found Bernardo's suicide note intervened, and Homolka moved in with relatives in Brampton.[7]"

        "header": "Arrest",
        "content": "Twenty-six months after Bernardo submitted a DNA sample, Toronto police were informed that it matched that of the Scarborough Rapist and immediately placed him under 24-hour surveillance. Metro Toronto Sexual Assault Squad investigators interviewed Homolka on February 9, 1993. Despite hearing their suspicions about Bernardo, she focused on his abuse of her. Later that night Homolka told her aunt and uncle that Bernardo was the Scarborough Rapist, that she and Bernardo were involved in the rape and murder of Mahaffy and French, and that the rapes were recorded.[34] The NRP subsequently reopened its investigation of Tammy Homolka's death. Two days later Homolka met with Niagara Falls lawyer George Walker, who sought legal immunity from Crown prosecutor Houlahan in exchange for her cooperation. She was also placed under 24-hour surveillance.[7] The couple's name change was approved on February 13, 1993.[3] The next day, Walker met with Crown Criminal Law Office director Murray Segal. After Walker told Segal about the videotapes, Segal advised him that, due to Homolka's involvement in the crimes, full immunity was not a possibility.[7] On February 17, detectives arrested Bernardo on several charges and obtained a search warrant. Because his link to the murders was weak, the warrant was limited; no evidence which was not expected and documented in the warrant could be removed from his property, and all videotapes found by police had to be viewed in the house. Damage had to be kept to a minimum; police could not tear down walls looking for the tapes. The search of the house (including updated warrants) lasted 71 days, and the only tape found by police had a brief segment of Homolka performing oral sex on \"Jane Doe\".[35] During a call from jail, Bernardo told his lawyer, Ken Murray, that the rape videos were hidden in a ceiling light fixture in the upstairs bathroom. Murray found the tapes and hid them from investigators. After Murray resigned as Bernardo's lawyer, his new attorney, John Rosen, turned the tapes over to police.[36] On May 5, Walker was informed that the government was offering Homolka a plea bargain of twelve years' imprisonment which she had one week to accept. If she declined, the government would charge her with two counts of first-degree murder, one count of second-degree murder and other crimes. Walker accepted the offer, and Homolka later agreed to it. On May 14, Homolka's plea bargain was finalized, and she began giving statements to police investigators. She told police that Bernardo boasted that he had raped as many as thirty women, twice as many as the police suspected.[31]"

        "header": "Publication ban",
        "content": "Citing the need to protect Bernardo's right to a fair trial, a publication ban was imposed on Homolka's preliminary inquiry.[37] The Crown had applied for the ban, which was imposed on July 5 by Francis Kovacs of the Ontario Court of Justice. Through her lawyers, Homolka supported the ban; Bernardo's lawyers argued that he would be prejudged by the ban, since Homolka had been portrayed as his victim. Four media outlets and one author also opposed the ban. Some lawyers argued that rumours could damage the future trial process more than the publication of evidence.[38] In February 1994, Homolka divorced Bernardo.[39] Public access to the Internet effectively nullified the court's order, as did proximity to the U.S.-Canada border. American journalists, not subject to the publication ban, published details of Homolka's testimony which were distributed by \"electronic ban-breakers\".[40] Newspapers in Buffalo, Detroit, Washington, D.C., New York City and the United Kingdom, as well as radio and television stations close to the border, divulged the details. Canadians brought copies of The Buffalo News across the border, prompting orders to the NRP to arrest all those with more than one copy at the border; extra copies were confiscated. Copies of other newspapers, including The New York Times, were turned back at the border or not accepted by distributors in Ontario.[38] Gordon Domm, a retired police officer who defied the publication ban by distributing details from foreign media, was convicted of two counts of contempt of court.[41]"

        "header": "Trial, conviction, and incarceration",
        "content": "Bernardo was tried for the murders of French and Mahaffy in 1995, and his trial included detailed testimony from Homolka and videotapes of the rapes.[42] Bernardo testified that the deaths were accidental, later claiming that Homolka was the actual killer. On September 1, 1995, Bernardo was convicted of a number of offences, including the two first-degree murders and two aggravated sexual assaults, and sentenced to life in prison without parole for at least twenty-five years.[43] He was designated a dangerous offender, making him unlikely to ever be released.[43] Homolka's plea bargain was criticized by many Canadians since Bernardo's first defence lawyer, Ken Murray, had withheld the videotapes exposing Homolka's culpability for seventeen months. The videotapes were considered crucial evidence, and prosecutors said that they would never have agreed to the plea bargain if they had seen them. Murray was later acquitted of obstruction of justice and faced a disciplinary hearing by the Law Society of Upper Canada.[44][45] Although Bernardo was kept in the segregation unit at Kingston Penitentiary for his own safety, he was attacked and harassed; he was punched in the face by another inmate when he returned from a shower in 1996. In June 1999, five convicts tried to storm his segregation range and a riot squad used gas to disperse them.[46] On February 21, 2006, the Toronto Star reported that Bernardo had admitted sexually assaulting at least ten other women in attacks not previously attributed to him. Most were in 1986, a year before the spree attributed to the Scarborough Rapist. Authorities suspected Bernardo in other crimes, including a string of rapes in Amherst, New York, and the drowning of Terri Anderson in St. Catharines,[47] but he has never acknowledged his involvement. His lawyer, Anthony G. Bryant, reportedly forwarded the information to legal authorities in November 2005.[48] In 2006, Bernardo gave a prison interview in which he claimed that he had reformed and would make a good parole candidate.[49][50] He became eligible to petition a jury for early parole in 2008 under the faint hope clause (since he committed multiple murders before the 1997 criminal-code amendment) but did not do so. In 2015, Bernardo applied for day parole in Toronto. According to the victims' lawyer, Tim Danson, it is unlikely that Bernardo will ever be released in any capacity due to his dangerous offender status.[51] In September 2013, Bernardo was transferred to Millhaven Institution in Bath, where he was reportedly segregated from other inmates.[52] In November 2015, Bernardo self-published A MAD World Order, a violent, fictional, 631-page e-book on Amazon.[53] By November 15, the book was reportedly an Amazon bestseller, but was removed from the website due to a public outcry.[54] In October 2018, Bernardo had been set to go to trial for possession of a \"shank\" weapon while incarcerated. However, the prosecution dropped the charges due to their determination that there was no reasonable probability of conviction.[55] Bernardo became eligible for parole in February 2018.[56] On October 17 of that year, he was denied day and full parole by the Parole Board of Canada.[57] His next parole hearing took place on June 22, 2021;[58] it took only one hour of deliberation by the presiding judge for his application to be turned down.[59] In May 2023, after spending a decade at Millhaven Institution, Bernardo was transferred to La Macaza Institution, a medium-security facility in Quebec, where he will continue to serve his indeterminate sentence.[1] The transfer caused controversy and initially the reason for the transfer was not provided to the public. Bernardo had successfully applied to be moved there.[60] In light of the scandal and dismay raised by the transfer, on June 5, 2023, Correctional Service Canada announced it was to review the decision[61] and on July 20, Commissioner Anne Kelly explained in a 30-minute press conference that the review board found the transfer to be \"sound\" in view of the passage of Bill C-83,[62] An Act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and another Act.[63] On July 26, 2023, Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino was dropped from cabinet and replaced by Dominic LeBlanc during a cabinet shuffle with the media attributing his demotion to the controversy around the Bernardo transfer.[64] The day after LeBlanc was installed, The Globe and Mail wrote an article covering his opinion that the legislation was inconsequential,[65] while Pierre Poilievre, the Leader of the Opposition, said that this was an example of the soft-on-crime policies of the Trudeau government.[66] On October 25, 2023, Bernardo's next parole hearing was scheduled for February 2024.[67] On March 6, 2024, MP Frank Caputo learnt there was an inmate hockey rink on the premises of La Macaza. Caputo said \"the cherry on top was seeing this beautiful gymnasium and next to that is a weight room. Much nicer than 95 per cent of Canadians have access to.\"[68]"

In his 1996 report, Campbell found that a lack of coordination, cooperation and communications by police and other elements of the judicial system contributed to a serial predator \"falling through the cracks\".[33] One of Campbell's key recommendations was for an automated case-management system for Ontario's police services to use in investigations of homicides and sexual assaults. Ontario is the only place in the world with this type of computerized case-management network. Since 2002, all municipal police services and the Ontario Provincial Police have had access to this network, known as PowerCase.[33]"

This was attributed to the fire's moderate to low intensity which spared most of the park trees, rejuvenated vegetation and triggered germination of rare species of fire poppies.

        "content": " The August 2020 California lightning wildfires (also referred to as the August lightning siege or August wildfire siege) were a series of 650 wildfires that ignited across Northern California in mid-August 2020, due to a siege of dry lightning from rare, massive summer thunderstorms, which were caused by an unusual combination of very hot, dry air at the surface, dry fuels, and advection of moisture from the remains of Tropical Storm Fausto northward into the Bay Area.[4][5] These fires burned between 1,500,000 acres (6,100\u00a0km2) to 2,100,000 acres (8,500\u00a0km2) within a 2\u20133 week period. The August 2020 lightning fires included three enormous wildfires: the SCU Lightning Complex, the August Complex, and the LNU Lightning Complex. On September 10, 2020, the August Complex set a record for the single-largest wildfire in the modern history of California, reaching a total area burned of 471,185 acres (1,907\u00a0km2). On September 11, the August Complex merged with the Elkhorn Fire, another massive wildfire of 255,039 acres (1,032\u00a0km2), turning the August Complex into a monster wildfire of 746,607 acres (3,021\u00a0km2).[6] The three major Bay Area fires, the SCU, LNU, and the CZU Lightning Complex, collectively burned about 846,000 acres (3,420\u00a0km2) by mid-September 2020, destroyed 2,723 structures, and took 6 lives.[7]"

        "content": "Between August 14 and August 16, Northern California was subjected to record-breaking warm temperatures,[8][9][10] due to anomalously strong high pressure over the region. Early on August 15, the National Weather Service for San Francisco issued a Fire Weather Watch[11] highlighting the risk of wildfire starts due to the combination of lightning risk due to moist, unstable air aloft, dry fuels, and hot temperatures near the surface. Later that day, the Fire Weather Watch was upgraded to a Red Flag Warning,[12] noting the risk of abundant lightning already apparent as the storms moved toward the region from the south. The source of this plume of moist, unstable air was the weakening Tropical Storm Fausto. Due to abnormal winds, this plume was streaming from up to 1,000 miles (1,600\u00a0km) off the coast of the Baja Peninsula into Northern California. This moisture then interacted with a high-pressure ridge situated over Nevada that was bringing a long-track heat wave to much of California and the West.[13]  These colliding weather systems then created excessive atmospheric instability that generated massive thunderstorms throughout much of Northern and Central California. Such thunderstorms are rare for California, but were more typical of Midwest garden-variety storms, with one location near Travis Air Force Base going from around 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C) to 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) in nearly 1\u20132 hours.[14] Additionally, much of these storms were only accompanied with dry lightning and produced little to no rain, making conditions very favorable for wildfires to spark and spread rapidly.[15] Early morning on August 16, when the first thunderstorms hit, around 2,500 lightning strikes hit the Bay Area, with 200 strikes happening in 30 minutes at one point, which the National Weather Service office in Bay Area labelled as \"insane\".[16] Within the next 72\u201396 hours, over 12,000 lightning strikes were recorded over Northern California. These lightning strikes sparked up to 585 wildfires, many of which grew to be very large at a rapid pace due to parched brush, especially in Northern California.[13] A second wave of thunderstorms was forecasted to hit on August 23 and 24; however, they failed to materialize over the Bay Area, which has been most impacted by these fires, and instead just produced light rain and a few lightning strikes over the Sierra Nevada, barely having any impact.[17]"

It first sparked around 6:37 AM on August 17, when a lightning storm passed over the Lake Hennessey area. Another lightning strike occurred at 6:39, near the Aonair winery, starting a fire that was 5 acres large.[46] About 60 fires had sparked in the region during that time period, however, while some blazes were quickly contained at 1 or 2 acres, others rapidly went out of control. Around 9 AM, dry, gale-force winds between 20 and 40 miles per hour helped to fan the flames of two uncontrolled blazes, the Gamble Fire and the Hennessey Fire. This caused the Hennessey Fire to explode to 2,400 acres (9.7\u00a0km2) by 5 PM August 17, prompting several evacuations.[47] By the night of August 18, the LNU complex had burned a total of 32,025 acres (129.60\u00a0km2) so far with no containment. 3 structures were destroyed, and the two biggest fires, the Hennessey and the Gamble Fires, both expanded to 10,000 acres (40\u00a0km2).[48] On August 19, the fire raced fast towards Vacaville, and caused hundreds of evacuations. Many people fled the city with only their basic necessities, with police officers and firefighters going door to door warning people to evacuate.[49] By August 20, the LNU fire had burned 215,000 acres (870\u00a0km2) and destroyed 480 structures. It forced the evacuation of some personnel in the Travis Air Force Base and the city of Healdsburg, California, that had already evacuated previously during the Tubbs Fire and the Kincade Fire.[45]"

By this time, only several hundred firefighters were actively engaging the fires.[10] Air attack reported additional spot fires beginning to flare up due to the deteriorating weather conditions, as at least 20 to 30 new fires ignited by lightning the day prior were discovered. One of those ignitions was the actively expanding Walbridge Fire (then the 13-4 Fire) that had started in rugged hills north of the Austin Creek State Recreation Area of Sonoma County.[11]  Evacuation warnings were put in place for the rural area in the hills between Healdsburg and Stewarts Point as the fire burned virtually unchecked.[11] Those evacuations were then expanded to include areas east of Sewell Road and King Ridge Road; north of Old Cazadero Road and Austin Creek; west of East Austin Creek and Wal Bridge Ridge; and south of Stewarts Point Skaggs Springs Road --as well as Guerneville, Monte Rio and other areas north of the Russian River-- which displaced hundreds of residences by nightfall as the fire grew to 500 acres.[11] Meanwhile, a 15 acre fire had also been spotted burning between Meyers Grade and Highway 1 north of the community of Jenner after being caused by lightning the day prior and would later be dubbed the Meyers Fire as it also rapidly expanded in the area.[11] Mandatory evacuations were put in place for areas west of Meyers Grade Road, south of Fort Ross Road and North of the intersection of Meyers Grade Road and Highway 1 throughout the day.[12] Evacuations orders that initially were put in place for roads near the Hennessey Fire off of Hennessey Ridge Road and Highway 128 and along Chiles Pope Valley Road and Lower Chiles Valley Road began to expand for much of the surrounding Lake Berryessa area as the fire and multiple other conflagrations effectively exploded in size in that area. These mandatory evacuations were put in place for the Berryessa Highlands and Spanish Flat areas as the fires rapidly raged towards those communities.[11] By this time, the Hennessey Fire has reportedly only destroyed one structure and two outbuildings in the area and threatened 205 structures, however an additional 390 homes in the Berryessa Estates area were now reportedly threatened and multiple structures were reported burning throughout the valley.[11] Later that afternoon, the fire further threatened additional rural areas along Highway 128 as it jumped the two-lane winding highway twice and it raced towards the Vaca Mountains bordering Napa and Solano County.[10] At 8:15 pm on Tuesday night, CAL FIRE has reported that the Hennessey Fire had consumed 10,000 acres, the Gamble Fire off of Berryessa Knoxville Road has also consumed 10,000 acres, the Spanish Fire near Spanish Flat had grown to 1,000 acres, the \"15-10\" near Putah Creek Bridge had burned 8,000 acres, and the newly-ignited Markley Fire near the Monticello Dam had also grown to 2,500 acres. All of them were reported to be zero percent contained that night.[13]  By 11:30 pm, the Hennessey Fire was seen still burning at a critical to dangerous rate of spread as the massive conflagration had traveled 13 miles to the southeast scorching the Vaca Mountains and rolled down the canyons towards the city of Fairfield and Vacaville.[10]  This dangerous fire spread spurred additional mandatory evacuations for north Fairfield and northwest Vacaville as the fireline made its way down Mix Canyon Road to Pleasants Valley Road and proceeded to destroy hundreds of structures in areas to the west and north of the cities.[10]"

The plan was to hike from the Agriculture and Fisheries Department Plover Cove Country Park Visitor Centre to Hok Tau, Fanling via Section 9 and 10 of Wilson Trail on Pat Sin Leng. It was an extremely dry day with a relative humidity of 31 per cent. The Hong Kong Observatory had issued a Red Fire Danger Warning, warning of a very high risk of wildfires. The fire was discovered at about 11:20, just as the group was around 150 metres away from Hsien Ku Fung. The fire quickly spread upwards, out of control. As the downhill escape route was blocked by the fire, the group was forced to flee up hill. Thirty-two students escaped and raised the alarm; but 18 people were trapped in Ma Lau Ai (Monkey Cliff). Teachers Chow Chi-Tsai and Wong Shuo Mei perished attempting to help students escape, while other injured students were left on the cliff waiting for rescue."

        "content": " Typhoon Ofelia, known as Typhoon Bising in the Philippines,[1] was the first of two typhoons in 1990 to directly affect the Philippines within a week. Typhoon Ofelia originated from an area of disturbed weather embedded in the monsoon trough situated near the Caroline Islands. Slowly organizing, the disturbance tracked westward, and was designated a tropical depression on June\u00a015. After an increase in convection, the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm on June\u00a017. On June\u00a019, Ofelia turned northwest and after development of a central dense overcast, Ofelia was upgraded into a typhoon late on June\u00a020. After turning north, Ofelia obtained its maximum intensity following the development of an eye. The typhoon skirted past the northeastern tip of Luzon and near the east coast of Taiwan, commencing a rapid weakening trend. On the evening on June\u00a023, Ofelia struck the southern portion of Zhejiang. The storm then began to track north, recurving towards the Korean Peninsula. The storm tracked through the province of Jiangsu, and at 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a024, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, only to merge with a frontal zone on June\u00a025. Although the inner core avoided the Philippines, the storm's large size resulted in inundation across the northern Philippines. The province of La Union was the hardest hit by the typhoon, where 22\u00a0people were killed and 90\u00a0homes were crushed. Three children perished and six others sustained injuries in Pasig. Overall, 56 people were killed and over 85,000\u00a0individuals were forced to flee their homes. Taiwan bore a direct landfall from Ofelia, dropping up to 460\u00a0mm (18\u00a0in) of rain. Hualien City was the hardest hit by the typhoon, where five people were killed. In all, Ofelia was the worst to hit eastern Taiwan in 30 years. More than 200 houses were destroyed or damaged and roughly 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) of rice paddies and vegetables were flooded. Roads and highways were blocked by landslides and floods. Agricultural losses exceeded NT$2.55\u00a0billion (US$94.7\u00a0million).[nb 1][nb 2] Seventeen people died and twenty-three were missing due to flooding and mudslides. Although during a weakening phase at the time, the typhoon drenched central China. In Wenzhou, 12\u00a0people were killed and monetary damage was estimated at 205\u00a0million RMB (US$42.8\u00a0million).[nb 3] In the province of Zhejiang, 15\u00a0fatalities were reported and 21 others were injured. In the neighboring province of Fujian, 15 people perished and 9,044\u00a0houses were demolished. About 91,000 hectares (220,000 acres) of farmland were inundated and damage was estimated at 338\u00a0million RMB (US$70.5\u00a0million). Nationwide, 40\u00a0people were killed by Ofelia."

        "content": "Typhoon Ofelia, the third typhoon of the season and first of June, originated from the monsoon trough situated near the Caroline Islands. On the morning of June 15, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to track an area of persistent convection with winds of 30\u00a0km/h (20\u00a0mph).[2] Eighteen hours later the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[3][nb 4] Initially, the depression tracked westward along the periphery of a subtropical ridge and in an environment of high wind shear that slowed the rate of organization. Following an increase in convection and curved banding features and an improvement in outflow, the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system on the morning of June\u00a017. An increase in organization warranted the JTWC to classify the system as a tropical depression at noon that day.[2] At the time, the depression was located roughly 390\u00a0km (240\u00a0mi) west of Yap.[5] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a017, the JMA opted to upgrade the depression into a tropical storm.[6][nb 5] Based on a Dvorak intensity estimate of T2.5/65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a018.[2] Initially, the JTWC forecast Ofelia to move generally westward because many tropical cyclone forecast models showed a strong ridge to its north. Instead Ofelia slowed down and turned northwest on June\u00a019 due to a surge in the southwesterly monsoon trough.[2] Ofelia gradually deepened,[5] and by 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020, the JMA elected to upgrade Ofelia into a severe tropical storm.[3] Following the development of a central dense overcast, Ofelia was upgraded into a typhoon by the JTWC late on June\u00a020,[2] even though satellite intensity estimates from the JMA suggested that Ofelia was a little weaker, with winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[3] Intensifying at a slower than climatological pace, Ofelia continued northwest as it rounded a subtropical ridge. On June\u00a022, Ofelia began to turn north.[2] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a022, the JMA upgraded Ofelia into a typhoon, while also estimating that the storm reached its maximum intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a minimum central barometric pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg).[6] At this time, the JTWC reported that Ofelia reached its peak intensity of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph); the basis for the estimate was a Dvorak classification of T5.0 and the appearance of an eye on weather satellite imagery.[2] The typhoon skirted past the northeastern tip of Luzon near peak intensity. It then turned northward, striking the east coast of Taiwan. Rapid weakening commenced due to land interaction,[2] and at noon on June\u00a023, the JMA lowered Ofelia to below typhoon strength,[3] with the JTWC doing the same six hours later.[2] Late on June\u00a023, Ofelia struck the southern portion of Zhejiang.[5] The storm then began to turn north and eventually recurve towards the Korean Peninsula.[2] The storm tracked through the province of Jiangsu,[5] and at 00:00 UTC on June\u00a024 the JMA declared Ofelia an extratropical cyclone.[3] According to the JTWC, however, this did not take place until 00:00 UTC on June\u00a025 when the system moved offshore and merged with a frontal zone.[2]"

Offshore, small craft advisories were issued.[8] All storm warnings were discontinued on June\u00a023 as the storm moved away.[9] The province of La Union was the hardest hit by the typhoon. There, 22\u00a0people were killed,[10] including a 60-year-old man and a child that were killed via a landslide[8] in Caba,[11] where 90\u00a0homes were destroyed. Throughout the province damage totaled P20\u00a0million (US$833,000).[1][nb 6][nb 7] In Pangasinan, west of La Union, two people were electrocuted.[10]  Three children died and six others suffered injuries in their homes due to heavy rains in Pasig.[8] A 4-year-old girl died in a landslide in the mountain resort city of Baguio.[12] Philippine Airlines cancelled five domestic flights to and from Manila while schools were closed in the capital and other affected areas.[11] Storm surge toppled a seawall there[13] and much of the city lost power.[14] Offshore Manila, Provider and the Kootenay were stranded and necessitated rescue.[11] Well to the south of Manila, lightning killed two people in Lanao del Sur.[10] In all, 56\u00a0people were killed[15] and 14 others were wounded in the country.[16] Moreover, 270 homes were destroyed[17] and over 2,000 were damaged.[15] A total of 85,000\u00a0individuals were forced to flee their homes as a result of flooding.[5] In response to the storm, the Philippine Red Cross ordered its chapters to provide relief to affected areas.

The fires were aggressive and grew quickly, prompting a state of emergency as well as several evacuation alerts and orders. The next day, 182 total fires were active throughout the province prompted the issuing of up to 20 evacuation alerts and orders. The Emergency Operating Centre in Prince George was activated, and Emergency Social Services opened a reception centre and shelter at the College of New Caledonia. Within three days, the first major fire, that started at two hectares, had grown to 4,000 hectares resulting in a mandatory evacuation order with up to 2,000 residents evacuated. By the following day over 10,000 Williams Lake residents were on an evacuation alert.

It also closed Bella Coola Highway to westbound traffic and created evacuation alerts the entire length of the Bella Coola Highway from Precipice to the junction with Williams Lake. No other fire season had had this breadth of large fires across the province. Three fires have achieved particularly notable sizes of over 100,000 hectares. First, the Hanceville Fire resulted from the merger of the Hanceville, Riske Creek and Raven Lake fires along Highway 20. As of August 20, the fire reached its largest size of 227,000 hectares, spreading as far south as Gang Ranch west of 100 Mile House. The Ashcroft Fire (also known as the Elephant Hill Fire) started on the Ashcroft Reserve, and spread north of Highway 99 to Green Lake, east of 100 Mile House. Finally the Nazko Complex started as a series of smaller fires west of Quesnel, two of which were notable in their own right, the Baezaeko River Fire, and the Tautri Lake Complex. These fires merged August 18, 2017, along with the Chezacut Fire and the Arc Mountain Fire, to form the Nazko Complex at over 432,000 hectares. This single fire was later renamed the Plateau Complex, centred on the Chilcotin Plateau. Overall this behemoth fire covered a combined area of 545,151 hectares, making it the largest fire in B.C.'s recorded history (roughly the same size as Prince Edward Island).

Human-caused climate change also played a significant role.[7] Human-caused fires were both accidental and intentional; all wildfires in BC are investigated to determine the fire origin and cause.[11] Fire bans and restrictions were put in place to limit further human-caused fires.[12] A study by researchers at Environment and Climate Change Canada found that climate change played a major role in the fires. They concluded that \u201cthe risk factors affecting the event, and the area burned itself, were made substantially greater by anthropogenic climate change... and that anthropogenic climate change increased the area burned by a factor of 7\u201311.\u201d[7] Heat waves and a lack of rainfall throughout the province leading up to the wildfires had dried out vegetation and soil. Also, pine forests with many pine trees killed by mountain pine beetle provided optimal fuel for fires. Considering these contributing factors, most areas of BC were rated as at extreme or high risk of fire.[13] The wildfires grew in size so quickly because of strong winds, in some regions up to 70\u00a0km/h.[14] On July 4, a car crash on Highway 1 near Cherry Creek caused a 15-hectare fire that was later contained by a crew of 47 fire fighters, 11 planes and a helicopter.[15]"

The damaged area had grown to  37,020 acres (57.8\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 149.8\u00a0km2).[9] Fire officials declared that the devastating wildfire was fully contained on Tuesday, August 23. The fire destroyed an estimated 105 homes and 213 other structures in San Bernardino County, and now ranks as the 20th most destructive wildfire in state history, according to Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.[10]"

Experts foresaw the problem as Southern California entered the hottest part of the fire season, with the land covered in brush that grew after the heaviest rains in over 100 years.[2] Although the wind, dry conditions, and steep terrain made the work of firefighters difficult, the loss of property had been low (as of early October); according to news reports from Friday, September 30, one home and handful of outbuildings had been lost. Mandatory evacuations were in place, involving at least 1,500 residents of the area. On October 2, 2005, over 17,000 acres (69 km2) were burned. Furthermore, only 5% of the blaze was estimated to have been contained by the approximately 3,000 firefighters battling it.[3] On October 6, the Topanga Fire was 100% contained, after it had expanded to 24,175 acres (97.8\u00a0km2)."

It is the primary airport serving the Inland Northwest, which consists of 30 counties and includes areas such as Spokane, the Tri-Cities, both in Eastern Washington, and Coeur d'Alene in North Idaho. The airport's code, GEG, is derived from its former name, Geiger Field, which honored Major Harold Geiger (1884\u20131927). As of 2015, Spokane International Airport (GEG) ranks as the 70th-busiest airport in the United States in terms of passenger enplanements.[3] At 4,131,266 total passengers served in 2023, it is the second busiest airport in Washington. GEG is served by six airlines with non-stop service to 15 airports in 13 markets. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017\u20132021, in which it is categorized as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.[4]"

        "content": "Known as Sunset Field before 1941, it was purchased from the county by the War Department and renamed Geiger Field (hence the IATA code GEG) after Major Harold Geiger, an Army aviation pioneer who died in a crash in 1927. During World War II, Geiger Field was a major training base by Second Air Force as a group training airfield for B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombardment units, with new aircraft being obtained from Boeing near Seattle. It was also used by Air Technical Service Command as an aircraft maintenance and supply depot; Deer Park Airport and Felts Field were auxiliaries. In 1943, General Hap Arnold established the first formal fire protection training course at Geiger Field, Washington. It was used until 1946. Geiger Field was served by a rail connection to the Great Northern Railway.[5] Geiger was closed in late 1945 and turned over to War Assets Administration (WAA), then transferred to Spokane County and developed into a commercial airport. The airport hosted USAF Air Defense Command interceptor units during the Cold War for air defense of Hanford Nuclear Reservation and Grand Coulee Dam. Built in 1942 as the Spokane Air Depot, Fairchild Air Force Base is four miles (7\u00a0km) to the west. It became Spokane's municipal airport in 1946, replacing Felts Field, and received its present name in 1960, after the City of Spokane was allotted Spokane Geiger Field by the Surplus Property Act and Air Canada started service to Calgary.[6] In November 1972, the 4702d Defense Wing moved to the airfield. It was still used by the Air Force into the early 1960s, with the 84th Fighter Group operating Convair F-106 Delta Dart interceptors.[7] The airport code is still GEG, for Geiger Field. The current Concourse A and B complex opened in 1965, designed by Warren C. Heylman and William Trogdon.[8][9] Occasional non-stop flights to southern California since the 1970s have been among the first to be suspended during economic downturns."

A new control tower has been built south of the airport, replacing the one near Concourse C. The new control tower is the tallest one in the State.  The Terminal, Rotunda, and Concourse C Enhancement Project (TRACE) was recently completed, designed by Bernardo/Wills Architects, P.C.[12] The project, which concluded in November 2006, added retail space and expanded security checkpoints in the airport's three concourses, and gave the Rotunda an aesthetic renovation. In 2010, 2000 feet was added to Runway 3\u201321 and parallel taxiways 'A' and 'G', enabling heavier aircraft departures in summer months. By 2023, the airport plans to add new gates, centralized security and expanded baggage claim space as it looks to add more direct flights, including to the east coast, to capitalize on and accommodate growing passenger and cargo traffic; the Spokane market has been hosting big events and attracting business to the area.[13][14]"

The remainder of the project is planned to begin construction in late 2024 and be completed the following year.[16][17] The second phase of the TREX program is focused on creating a centralized TSA screening checkpoint and baggage claim, as well as an improved operations center. This central connection will also allow easier navigation between the A/B and C concourses.[15] As of January 2023, the 145,000 square foot Central Hall is estimated to cost $179 million and has a planned construction timeline of 2025 to 2027.[18] Other projects planned in the TREX program include relocation of the rental car facilities, and renovation of the A/B concourse.[15]"

The 37,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (3,400\u00a0m2) rotunda is supported entirely along its perimeter and features no obstructions.[22] Concourse A houses 5 gates (11-15), while Concourse B houses 8 gates (1\u20138). The Concourse A-B complex originally opened on April 1, 1965, and was designed by Warren C. Heylman and William Trogdon.[23] The new terminal cost a reported US$4,600,000 (equivalent to $44,470,000 in 2023) and was dedicated on May 8, 1965,[24] in a ceremony attended by Senator Warren Magnuson and Civil Aeronautics Board chair Alan Boyd.[22] Designed in the Neo-Expressionism style, the building's architecture prominently features exposed concrete as well as distinct sculpted and monolithic architectural shapes and forms. As the airport has continued to incrementally expand, some of the original architectural intent of the Concourse A-B complex has been lost. While several expansions to the concourse extended the building's original architectural style, other additions have altered it. In 1974, a second floor was added to both Concourses A and B to allow for the implementation of passenger boarding bridge access to aircraft. The new floors, while sharing some material commonality with the original Heylman and Trogdon concourse, lacked the same curvy and sculpted neo-expressionistic forms. The later additions of the ground transportation facility and Concourse C to the ends of the concourse building further altered the architecture by replacing its distinct bookend elevations and entrances with corridors to the adjacent buildings. Interior renovations in the mid-2000s also replaced many of Concourse A-B complex's original sculpted forms and monolithic materials with more rectilinear forms and contemporary finish materials. Despite this, many of the original architectural elements remain integral to the space (such as the exposed concrete roof trusses and concrete columns), creating a juxtaposition between the newer elements and the original architecture. Under the proposed Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX) program to accommodate projected growth, the separate baggage claim areas in Concourse A-B and Concourse C would be consolidated into a single baggage claim with five carousels, and A-B would receive a renovation. Ultimately, operations at A-B would wind down under long-term plans to construct a new terminal in 2030, at the earliest.[25] Southwest Airlines is the current primary occupant operating in and out of Concourse A. Delta and United Airlines both operate in and out of Concourse B. American Airlines operated in and out of Concourse B before relocating to Concourse C in March 2016."

        "header": "Concourse C",
        "content": "Concourse C houses 9 gates, both upper (30-32) and lower (21a, 21b, 22-26). The lower level gates house regional turboprop aircraft, while the upper-level gates house narrow-body aircraft. The current iteration of Concourse C opened in 2000 after a $20 million redevelopment and expansion project, designed by Bernardo-Wills Architects.[26]  The project, which broke ground in 1998 added 80,000 square feet (7,400\u00a0m2) to the concourse including a new baggage claim and two-story passenger facility. The 11,000-square-foot (1,000\u00a0m2) concourse was remodeled into service and operations functions.[27] The new Concourse C has a more contemporary architectural style, contrasting the appearance of the Concourse A and B complex, by employing a large use of metal cladding and large curtain window walls on its exterior building envelope. However, it draws inspiration from its neo-expressionist neighbor by architecturally expressing a modular, repetitive, and exposed structural grid through its fa\u00e7ade and interior lobby areas. Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary carrier Horizon Air were the primary occupants operating in and out of Concourse C after Frontier Airlines ceased operations to Spokane in January 2015.[28] However, that changed once American Airlines relocated to Concourse C in March 2016. Alaska and American operate in and out of the upper-level gates, while Horizon operates in and out of the lower level gates. In October 2022, the airport broke ground on Phase 1 of the Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX) program which includes expansion of Concourse C. The concourse is currently under construction and expected to reopen in late 2025.[15][17]"

United States of America case, the dismissal document from May 21, 2019, points to a cause for the fire:[10] The Army training unit continued to engage in live fire training exercises through the afternoon on July 30, 2016.

A 'very high' wildfire warning covering much of Scotland, which had been in place since 26 May, was extended to 5 June.[6] The cause of the wildfire is unknown, but the SFRS had launched an investigation into its cause.[4] They also said it had burned through a 30\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (78\u00a0km2) area of scrub and woodland, which would make it the largest wildfire in the UK's history.[7] This number was later revised by the fire service to 6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km2; 1,600\u00a0ha).[8] The fire caused lots of damage to the RSPB Corrimony nature reserve, destroying hundreds of native trees which were planted to regenerate habitats.

Limited road access prevented ground crews from getting near the fire for several hours. Despite the efforts of helicopters and air tankers, by 7:28\u00a0p.m. the fire had burned 500 acres (200\u00a0ha).[2] On August 15, at around 2:35\u00a0p.m. PDT, high winds and thunderstorm activity spawned three fire tornadoes, two of which were rated EF1. The National Weather Service issued its first-ever fire tornado warning resulting from the building pyrocumulonimbus cloud in response to the incident, which went into effect for Lassen County.[4][5] By the morning of August 16, the fire had expanded to 20,000 acres (8,100\u00a0ha). Evacuation orders were issued for areas in Lassen County south of SR 70 and west of US 395. SR 70 was closed between SR 49 and US 395 as fire crews worked to prevent the fire from spreading north of Beckwourth Pass. The fire briefly jumped north of SR 70 and east of US 395 but was quickly stopped in those directions.[6] By the evening of August 16, helped by strong winds, the fire had burned 29,828 acres (12,071\u00a0ha). Evacuation orders were expanded to Balls Canyon Road, Long Valley Road, Bordertown, Copperfield, and Cold Springs as the fire spread east into Nevada and the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. About 580 firefighters, 42 engines and 6 aircraft were on the scene.[7] Crews had made progress on the southeast flank of the fire on August 17, mandatory evacuations were lifted for Cold Springs, and SR 70 was reopened.[8] The Dog Valley and Long Valley areas of the Carson Ranger District on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest were closed to recreational access.[9] By evening, advisory evacuation orders were in place for Loyalton, Chilcoot, Vinton, and Sierra Brooks. Lightning strikes started several new fires to the south around 7:30 pm, but rain after midnight helped slow fire activity.[10] As of August 17, five homes and six other structures had been destroyed.[11] On August 18, the fire had been largely contained in the north and east, and mandatory evacuations were lifted in Lassen County. However, it continued spreading rapidly to the south and west, largely due to the lightning strikes there the previous day.[12][13] The fire grew to 43,444 acres (17,581\u00a0ha) and was 10\u00a0percent contained.[14] High winds continued throughout August 19, but crews had managed to slow the fire spread considerably. Evacuation advisories were lifted for Cold Springs and Bordertown.[15] By the evening, evacuation advisories were also lifted for Chilcoot, Vinton and Loyalton, although evacuation orders remained in place for Balls Canyon Road, Long Valley Road, and Copperfield, and an evacuation advisory for Sierra Brooks.[16] On the morning of August 20, evacuation advisories were lifted for Sierra Brooks and Copperfield.[17] As of 5:44 pm on August 20, the fire had burned 46,582 acres (18,851\u00a0ha) and was 60\u00a0percent contained. Air quality continued to be extremely poor in Sierra Valley and Reno, with visibility highly impaired by smoke. On the morning of August 21, evacuation orders remained in place for Balls Canyon Road and Long Valley Road.[18] The fire had burned 46,872 acres (18,968\u00a0ha) and remained at 60\u00a0percent containment.[19] At 6:30 am on August 22, the fire was at 47,029 acres (19,032\u00a0ha) and was 75\u00a0percent contained. Wind activity decreased significantly over the weekend helping fire crews to expand containment. A total of six homes and 29 other structures were reported destroyed. All evacuation orders were lifted as of this time, though the Dog Valley area of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest remained closed.[20] The fire was declared 100 percent contained on August 26.

On September\u00a020, Ida formed in the Western Pacific near Guam. It moved to the west and rapidly intensified into a 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) typhoon by the next day. On September\u00a022, Ida turned to the north and continued its quick rate of intensification. Two days later, the Hurricane Hunters observed a minimum barometric pressure of 877\u00a0mb (25.9\u00a0inHg), as well as estimated peak winds of 325\u00a0km/h (202\u00a0mph). This made Ida the strongest tropical cyclone on record at the time, although it was surpassed by Typhoon June 17\u00a0years later. Ida weakened as it continued to the north-northeast, and made landfall in Japan on southeastern Honsh\u016b with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) on September\u00a026. It became extratropical the next day, and dissipated on the September\u00a028 to the east of the country. Ida caused torrential flooding to southeastern Japan, resulting in over 1,900\u00a0mudslides. Damage was estimated at $50\u00a0million, and there were 1,269\u00a0fatalities."

The storm moved westward, crossing the island as it gradually intensified into a typhoon.[1] On September\u00a022, Ida began a motion to the north, following a path typical of September typhoons.[2] Around that time, the Hurricane Hunters reported that the eye was obscured, and over the subsequent 24\u00a0hours the eyewall remained incomplete. However, over a 14-hour period beginning at 15:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, Typhoon Ida began undergoing rapid deepening, at times a rate of 5.8\u00a0mbar (0.17\u00a0inHg) per hour. The eye became increasingly well-defined,[3] and near 05:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, a reconnaissance aircraft deployed a dropsonde in the typhoon about 600\u00a0mi (970\u00a0km) northwest of Guam. The instrument recorded a barometric pressure of 877\u00a0mbar (25.9\u00a0inHg), which made Ida the strongest tropical cyclone on record at the time as measured by pressure.[4] Around the time of its lowest pressure, the Hurricane Hunters estimated flight-level winds of 345\u00a0km/h (214\u00a0mph).[4] The reconnaissance flight observed a surface temperature in the eye of 33\u00a0\u00b0C (91\u00a0\u00b0F) with 50%\u00a0humidity; such a warm and dry eye was rather unusual for being located over the open ocean. By less than 36\u00a0hours after its peak intensity, aircraft reported that the eye had become filled with clouds, which indicated weakening.[3] Ida's winds gradually decreased, and the typhoon struck Japan in southeastern Honshu on September\u00a026 with winds of 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 949 millibars (28.0\u00a0inHg).[7] The typhoon crossed the eastern portion of the country and emerged from Fukushima Prefecture into the Pacific Ocean. Early on September\u00a027, Ida became extratropical, and its remnants moved through Sapporo and the Kuril Islands before dissipating late on September\u00a028.[1] When the Hurricane Hunters reported Ida's lowest pressure, the measurement was 10\u00a0mb (0.30\u00a0inHg) lower than the previous record of 887\u00a0mbar (26.2\u00a0inHg), set by a typhoon in 1927.[4] Ida retained its status as the most intense typhoon until 1973, when Typhoon Nora attained the same minimum pressure. In November\u00a01975, Typhoon June surpassed both and attained a minimum pressure of 875\u00a0mbar (25.8\u00a0inHg).[8] Typhoon Tip in October\u00a01979 became the strongest on record with a minimum pressure of 870\u00a0mbar (26\u00a0inHg), which remains the record.[9]"

In the Tokyo area, the storm caused widespread power outages and severely disrupted the transportation system.[11] During the storm, communications were severed with the Izu Peninsula,[14] where damage was heaviest. Across the country, more than 520,000\u00a0homes were flooded, which is the most on record. As a result, the Japan Meteorological Agency gave Ida the special local name of the \"Kanogawa Typhoon\".[19] The typhoon damaged 16,743\u00a0homes to some degree, including 2,118\u00a0that were destroyed and another 2,175\u00a0that were severely damaged.[20] Although it was initially reported that the storm left about 500,000\u00a0people homeless,[12] the total was later lowered to 12,000\u00a0people left homeless due to the storm. In addition, the typhoon destroyed more than 244\u00a0road or rail bridges. Overall damage was estimated at $50\u00a0million (1958\u00a0USD, $544.6 million in 2024),[7] or 20.6\u00a0billion yen.[21] Overall, the typhoon injured 1,138\u00a0people and killed a total of 1,269\u00a0people. This makes Ida the sixth-deadliest storm in the country, behind Typhoon Ruth in 1951, Typhoon Marie in 1954, Typhoon Ida in 1945, the 1934 Muroto typhoon, and Typhoon Vera in 1959.[22] Included in the death toll were 381\u00a0people that were missing and presumed killed.[15] After the storm subsided, the United States military provided supplies and soldiers to assist in relief work.[14] About 200\u00a0firemen along the Kano River assisted in relief efforts.[23]"

Twelve members of the team, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old assistant coach entered the cave on 23\u00a0June after a practice session. Shortly after they entered, heavy rainfall began and partially flooded the cave system, blocking their way out and trapping them deep within. Efforts to locate the group were hampered by rising water levels and strong currents, and the team were out of contact with the outside world for more than a week. The cave rescue effort expanded into a massive operation amid intense worldwide public interest and involved international rescue teams. On 2\u00a0July, after advancing through narrow passages and muddy waters, British divers John Volanthen and Rick Stanton found the group alive on an elevated rock about 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi) from the cave mouth. Rescue organisers discussed various options for extracting the group, including whether to teach them basic underwater diving skills to enable their early rescue, to wait until a new entrance to the cave was found or drilled or to wait for the floodwaters to subside by the end of the monsoon season several months later. After days of pumping water from the cave system and a respite from the rainfall, the rescue teams worked quickly to extract the group from the cave before the next monsoon rain, which was expected to bring additional downpours on 11\u00a0July. Between 8 and 10\u00a0July, all 12 boys and their coach were rescued from the cave by an international team.[9] The rescue effort involved as many as 10,000 people, including more than 100 divers, scores of rescue workers, representatives from about 100 governmental agencies, 900 police officers and 2,000 soldiers. Ten police helicopters, seven ambulances, more than 700 diving cylinders and the pumping of more than one billion litres of water from the caves were required. Saman Kunan, a 37-year-old former Royal Thai Navy SEAL, died of asphyxiation during an attempted rescue on 6\u00a0July while returning to a staging base in the cave after delivering diving cylinders to the trapped group. The following year, in December 2019, rescue diver and Thai Navy SEAL Beirut Pakbara died of a blood infection contracted during the operation.[10][11][12]"

Since part of the system is seasonally flooded, a sign advising against entering the caves during the rainy season (July to November) is posted at the entrance.[14] On Saturday 23\u00a0June 2018, a group of 12 boys aged between 11 and 16, from a local junior football team named the Wild Boars, and their 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekkaphon Kanthawong,[15] went missing after exploring the caves. According to early news reports, they planned to have a birthday party in the cave after the football practice and spent a significant sum of money on food, but they denied this in a news conference after the rescue.[16] The team was stranded in the tunnels by sudden and continuous rainfall after they had entered the cave system.[17] They were forced to leave some food supplies behind when fleeing the rising water.[18][19][20][21] At around 7 pm that evening, head coach and founder of the team, Nopparat Kanthawong (Thai: \u2021\u220f\u00f4\u2021\u220f\u00fb\u2021\u220f\u00a3\u2021\u220f\u00b1\u2021\u220f\u00ef\u2021\u220f\u00f4\u2021\u03c0\u00e5 \u2021\u220f\u00c5\u2021\u220f\u00b1\u2021\u220f\u00ec\u2021\u220f\u00eb\u2021\u220f\u221e\u2021\u220f\u00df\u2021\u220f\u00e1\u2021\u220f\u00a9\u2021\u03c0\u00e5), checked his phone and found about 20 missed calls from parents worried that their children had not returned. Nopparat dialed assistant coach Ekkaphon and a number of the boys, but he was unable to reach them. He eventually contacted Songpon Kanthawong, a 13-year-old member of the team who said that he had separated from the team after practice and that the rest of the boys had entered the Tham Luang caves. The coach raced to the caves, finding abandoned bicycles and bags near the entrance and water seeping from the muddy pathway.[22] He alerted authorities to the missing group after seeing the team's unclaimed belongings.[23]"

On 28\u00a0June, a United States Air Force team\u201a\u00c4\u00eereportedly United States Air Force Pararescuemen[42] from the 320th Special Tactics Squadron, the 31st Rescue Squadron, and the 353rd Special Operations Group\u201a\u00c4\u00eejoined them. By 29\u00a0June, an Australian Federal Police team of Specialist Response Group divers had arrived, followed by a Chinese team of divers from the Beijing Peaceland Foundation on Sunday, 1 July.[37][43][44][45][46] Meanwhile, policemen with sniffer dogs searched the surface above for shaft openings that could provide alternative entrances to the cave system below. Drones and robots were also used in the search, but no technology existed to scan for people deep underground.[47] BCRC divers Richard Stanton and John Volanthen advanced through the cave complex placing diving guidelines, supported by Thailand-based Belgian cave diver Ben Reymenants[48][49][50][51] and French diver Maksym Polejaka.[52][53][54][55][56] The search had to be suspended due to the weather, as rainfall increased the flow of water in the cave where the divers were battling strong currents and poor visibility.[49][57] The search resumed on 2 July after the weather improved. The twelve boys and the coach were discovered at approximately 22:00[58] by Stanton and Volanthen, whose efforts were overseen from outside by BCRC diver Robert Harper.[59] The boys and coach were on a narrow rock shelf about 400 metres (1,300\u00a0ft) beyond the \"Pattaya Beach\" chamber,[58][60][61] named after an above-ground beach in Thailand. Volanthen had been placing guidelines in the cave to assist others in navigation when he ran out of line. He then swam to the surface and soon found the missing group, smelling them before hearing or seeing them.[62][63] The ledge where they were found is about 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi)[64] from the cave mouth.[65] A video of the encounter, showing the boys and their interactions with the divers, was posted on Facebook by the Thai Navy SEALs.[66] Former Chiang Rai provincial governor Narongsak Osatanakorn\u00a0[th], who was in charge of rescue work, said, \"We found them safe. But the operation isn't over.\"[67][68] The Thai, US, Australian and Chinese diving teams supported by the BCRC divers began transporting diving bottles into the cave system and established an air supply storage area in Chamber 3.[49][69] On 3 July, the trapped group was joined by three Thai Navy SEALs who supported them until the rescue. The SEALs included Thai Army doctor Lt. Col. Pak Loharachun of the 3rd Medical Battalion, who had completed the Navy SEALs course.[70][71] Thai officials told reporters that rescuers were providing health checks and treatment and keeping the boys entertained and that none of those trapped was in serious condition. \"They have been fed with easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor\", Rear Admiral Apagorn Youkonggaew, head of the Thai Navy's Special Forces, told reporters. A video made by the rescuers, and shared a few hours later by the Thai Navy SEALs, showed all twelve boys and their coach introducing themselves and stating their age. Wrapped in emergency blankets and appearing frail, they all said hello to the outside world. \"Sawatdi khrap\", each boy said with his palms together in wai, the traditional Thai greeting.[72] A second video shows a medic treating them.[73] It was believed that some of the group could not swim,[74] complicating what would already be a difficult rescue.[75] The Army doctor discovered that they had attempted to dig their way out of the cave. The team members had used rock fragments to dig every day, creating a hole five metres deep.[71] BCRC diver Jason Mallinson offered the boys and coach an opportunity to send messages to relatives by using his wet notes pad.[57] Many of the notes said they were safe, reassured family members that everything was fine, and included words of love, reassurance and encouragement.[76]"

The site was divided into several zones: restricted areas for the Thai Navy SEALs, other military personnel, and civilian rescuers; an area for the relatives to give them privacy; and areas for the press and the general public.[77] An estimated 10,000 people contributed to the rescue effort, including more than 100 divers, representatives from about 100 government agencies, 900 police officers, 2,000 soldiers and numerous volunteers. Equipment included ten police helicopters, seven police ambulances, and more than 700 diving cylinders, of which more than 500 were in the cave at any time while another 200 were in the queue to be refilled. More than a billion litres of water (the equivalent of 400 Olympic-size swimming pools) was removed.[78][79]"

In an effort to drain the cave, a stone diversion dam was built upstream, and systems were installed to pump water out of the cave and divert flows that were entering it. On 4\u00a0July, it was estimated that the pumps were removing 1,600,000\u00a0L/h (420,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal/h) from the cave, ruining nearby farm fields in the process.[87][88] For a time, well-meaning volunteers were inadvertently pumping water back into the groundwater supply.[89] Helped by a spell of unseasonably dry weather, these efforts reduced water levels by 1.5 centimetres (0.6\u00a0in) per hour on 5\u00a0July, enabling the rescue teams to walk 1.5 kilometres (0.93\u00a0mi) into the cave. However, heavy rains forecast for 8\u00a0July were expected to halt or reverse the process and could even flood the position where the boys and their coach were trapped.[90] On 6 July, the oxygen level in the cave was detected to have dropped, raising fears that the boys might develop hypoxia if they remained there for a prolonged time. By 8\u00a0July, the oxygen level was measured to be 15%; the level needed to maintain normal function for humans is between 19.5% and 23.5%.[91] Thai military engineers attempted to install an air supply line to the boys, but the effort was abandoned as impractical.[57]"

Thai SEALs and US Air Force experts then refined the plan to use teams of divers to bring out the weakened boys.[96]"

His dive buddy attempted CPR without success. Kunan was brought to Chamber 3 where CPR was attempted again, but he could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead at about 1\u00a0am on 6\u00a0July.[101][103] Formerly a member of Thai Navy SEALs class 30, Kunan had left the SEALs in 2006 at the rank of petty officer 1st class; he was working in security at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport when he volunteered to assist with the cave rescue.[101][103] He was posthumously promoted to lieutenant commander by the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy, an unprecedented rise of seven ranks.[104][105] A funeral, sponsored and attended by the Thai royal family, was held on 14\u00a0July. On the same day, Kunan was awarded the Knight Grand Cross (first class) of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant by King Maha Vajiralongkorn.[105] Another rescue diver and Thai Navy SEAL, Beirut Pakbara, died the following year from septic shock after acquiring an unspecified latent blood infection during the rescue operation.[106][107]"

        "content": "On the morning of 8 July, officials instructed the media and all non-essential personnel around the cave entrance to clear the area as a rescue operation was imminent, due to the threat of monsoon rains later in the week, which were expected to flood the cave until October. For the first part of the extraction, 18 rescue divers\u201a\u00c4\u00ee13 international cave divers and five Thai Navy SEALs\u201a\u00c4\u00eewere sent into the caves to retrieve the boys, with one diver to accompany each boy on the dive out.[57][108][109][110] The international cave diving team was led by four British divers: John Volanthen, Richard Stanton, Jason Mallinson, and Chris Jewell (each assigned a boy), and two Australians: Richard Harris, an anesthesiologist, and his friend Craig Challen, a veterinarian.[51][57][111] Irishman Jim Warny became an additional lead diver on the final day of the rescue to bring back assistant coach Ekkaphon,[112] and physician Harris took over the lead rescue of Pong.[25]:\u200a268\u201a\u00c4\u00ec270\u200a The lead divers' portion of the journey would stretch over one kilometre, going through submerged routes while being supported by 90 Thai and foreign divers at various points performing medical check-ups, resupply of air tanks, and other emergency roles.[113] There were conflicting reports that the boys were rescued with the weakest first or strongest first. In fact, the order was which boy volunteered first.[16] \"I talked with Dr. Harris. Everyone was strong and no one was sick,\" Ekkaphon told the press. \"Everybody had a strong mental state. Dr. Harris said\u00a0... there's no preference.\" The team decided as a group that the boys who lived the farthest away should leave first. Ekkaphon also stated in their 18\u00a0July press conference, not realizing at the time that their story had attracted global media attention: \"We were thinking, when we get out of the cave, we would have to ride the bicycle home\u00a0... so the persons who live the furthest away would be allowed to go out first\u00a0... so that they can go out and tell everyone that we were inside, we were okay.\"[114] Each boy was dressed in a wetsuit, with a buoyancy aid, harness, and a positive pressure full-face mask. Harris administered the anaesthetic ketamine to the boys before the journey, rendering them \"fully unconscious.\"[115] This was to prevent them from panicking on the journey, which would risk their lives and those of their rescuers.[25]:\u200a99\u200a They were also given the anti-anxiety drug alprazolam, and the drug atropine to steady their heart rates and reduce saliva production to prevent choking.[25]:\u200a129\u200a[97][116][117] A cylinder with 80% oxygen was clipped to their front, a handle was attached to their back, and they were each tethered to a diver in case they were lost in the poor visibility. The rescue divers described each child as \"a package\".[57][118][119][120] The Thai government granted Harris and two medical assistants diplomatic immunity against judicial action,[25]:\u200a136\u201a\u00c4\u00ec138\u200a in case something went wrong.[118][121][122][123] The anaesthetic lasted between 45 minutes and one hour, requiring divers, whom Harris had trained, to administer \"top-up\" ketamine injections during the three-hour journey.[57][99][124] The boys were maneuvered out by the swimming divers who held onto their back or chest, with each boy on either the right or left side of the diver, depending on the guideline; in very narrow spots the divers pushed the boys from behind.[57][119] The boys were carefully navigated through tight passages to avoid dislodging their face masks against rocks. The divers kept their heads higher than the boys so that, in poor visibility, the divers would hit their head against the rocks first.[57] The divers knew the boys were breathing from their exhaust bubbles, which they could see and feel.[118] After a short dive to a dry section, the divers and boys were met by three divers, and the boys' dive gear was removed.[116] The boys were then transported on a drag stretcher over 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft) of rocks and sand hills. Craig Challen assessed them, and their dive gear was put back on before they were re-submerged for the next section.[57] The boys arrived at 45-minute intervals.[125] After being delivered by the divers into the staging base in Chamber 3, the boys were passed along a \"daisy chain\" by hundreds of rescuers stationed along the treacherous path out of the cave.[126] Wrapped in \"sked\" rescue stretchers, the boys were alternately carried, slid and zip-lined along a complex arrangement of pulleys installed by rock climbers.[127] Many areas from Chamber 3 to the entrance of the cave were still partially submerged and rescuers described having to transport the boys over slippery rocks and through muddy water for hours.[128] The journey from Chamber 3 to the cave entrance had initially taken about four to five hours, but this was reduced to less than an hour after a week of draining and clearing the mud path using shovels.[126] The authorities warned that the extraction would take several days to complete because crews had to replace air tanks, gear, and other supplies, requiring ten to twenty hours between each run.[32][129][109] Shortly after 19:00, local officials confirmed that two of the boys had been rescued and taken to Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital.[130][131][132] Shortly afterwards, two more boys exited the cave and were assessed by medical officials.[130] Low water levels had reduced the time required for the rescues.[133] The lower water was due to improved weather and the construction of a weir outside the cave to help control the water.[134] On 9 July, four more boys were rescued from the cave.[135] On 10\u00a0July, the last four boys and their coach were rescued from the cave.[3][4][5][111][136] The rescue procedure was streamlined with practice, so the total time to extract a boy was reduced from three hours on the first day to just over two hours on the final day, allowing four boys and the coach to be rescued.[110][125] The three Thai Navy SEALs and the Army doctor who had stayed with the boys the entire time were the last to dive out. Three of these divers made it to Chamber 3, joining waiting rescuers when the pumps shut off for an uncertain reason, possibly due to a burst water pipe.[137][138] The water levels in Chamber 3 started to rise, which would have cut off their access to the first two chambers and the cave entrance.[137] \"All of a sudden a water pipe burst and the main pump stopped working,\" a diver stated. \"We really had to run from the third chamber to the entrance because the water level was rising very quickly\u201a\u00c4\u00eelike 50\u00a0cm every 10 minutes.\"[138] This forced up to 100 rescuers still located more than 1.5 kilometres (0.93\u00a0mi) inside the cave to evacuate in a hurry, abandoning the rescue equipment inside the cave.[139] The last diver made it back to Chamber 3 as everyone was preparing to leave.[137] The rescuers managed to rush to the cave exit in under an hour.[139] A number of news outlets reported on the role of assistant coach Ekkaphon during the rescue. Previously a Buddhist monk, he had calmed the boys by guiding them in meditation during the ordeal. He also passed on a message in which he apologised for putting the children in danger.[22][140]"

Detailed tests of their eyes, nutrition, mental health and blood were carried out. A Health Ministry physician said all the boys showed an increase in white blood cells, so preventive antibiotic doses were given to the entire team.[145]"

Local communities, as well as the boys' parents, emphasised that they did not blame the boys or their coach, as the rain had arrived a month earlier than usual.[152] Vern Unsworth, a British caver mapping the cave, stated, \"Nobody's to blame, not the coach, not the boys. They were just very unlucky\u00a0... It wasn't just the rain that day, the mountain is like a sponge and waters from earlier rain were raising the levels.\" Unsworth said that he himself had been planning to make a solo venture into the complex on 24\u00a0June, when he received a telephone call saying the boys were missing there.[153] While the police chief told newspaper Khao Sod that he \"hadn't ruled out\" pressing negligence charges against the coach for putting the team in danger, no calls were made to take legal action against him. A number of lawyers stated that the coach would probably not face criminal charges, since Thai law also takes into consideration whether a person has malicious intent. In mainstream media, Ekkaphon has widely been held \"a hero\" and was a \"calm voice [that] helped boys to beat despair in the darkness.\"[154][155][156] The coach was reported to have treated the boys with care, giving them his food, helping them remain calm, and instructing them to drink the relatively clean water dripping from the cave walls instead of the murky floodwaters that trapped them.[citation needed] When asked if Ekkaphon should be held legally responsible for negligence, Mongkhon Bunpiam, the father of 12-year-old Mongkhon, rejected the suggestion: \"We would never do that\u00a0... the boys love their coach\u00a0... and we as parents don't want it either. Coach Eak has been good to my boy, and now I hear how he gave them hope, and kept them calm for so many days without food. I have great admiration for him.\"[154] Tanawut Vibulrungruang, father of 11-year old Chanin, was reported to be \"touched by the actions of the team's coach. Without him\u00a0... he doesn't know how the kids could have survived.\"[157] Head coach Nopparat said he would not have approved of the hike, but was confident in Ekkaphon's ability to take care of the boys.

        "content": "When the rescue operation was concluded, the Tham Luang Nang Non cave and adjacent forest park were immediately closed to the public.[226] Realising the massive tourism potential, the Thai authorities announced plans to turn the cave into a living museum to showcase the multinational rescue effort.[227] The head of the rescue mission and former governor of Chiang Rai province, Narongsak Osatanakorn\u00a0[th], predicted that the area was set to become a \"major attraction for Thailand\",[227] and the deputy head of national parks, Chongklai Woraponsathron, said \"we are lucky that we are going to have a world class tourist attraction\".[228] However, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha highlighted the concerns for tourist safety and stated that the cave was \"dangerous\",[228] insisting that the site could not be reopened until adequate precautions had been implemented to safeguard visitors.[226] Prior to the 2018 cave rescue, the area was largely undeveloped and had limited facilities for tourists.[227] To honour those involved in the rescue operation, a huge mural was created by a team of local artists.[229] It first went on display at Wat Rong Khun, a Buddhist temple in Chiang Rai province, before being moved to a memorial pavilion near the Tham Luang cave entrance in December 2018.[230] Saman Kunan, the former Thai Navy SEAL who died during the rescue operation, is commemorated with a twice life-size bronze statue situated in front of the memorial pavilion.[231] Designed by renowned national artist Chalermchai Kositpipat[232] and produced at a fine art foundry in Thailand's Ayutthaya province, the statue depicts Kunan with 13 wild boars at his feet, symbolising the 12 boys and their football coach.[233] After the forest park was reopened on 16 November 2018, thousands of tourists flocked to the site, but they were not allowed inside the cave as work was under way on creating a living museum dedicated to the rescue.[234] The cave was officially opened to the public 12 months later, on 1\u00a0November 2019, in an inauguration ceremony attended by monks, Thai government officials and forest rangers.[235] This was the first time since the rescue that tourists had been allowed to enter the cave itself,[236] although there was a limit of twenty people at a time, and they were only permitted to visit the main entrance cavern.[237] At around the same time, Tham Luang was upgraded from a forest park to a national park in view of its enhanced status as a tourist hotspot.[237] Forestry officials said that prior to the rescue, around 40,000 tourists had visited the area each year, but more than 1\u00a0million had visited since the park reopened the previous November.[236] On 24 June 2023, a ceremony was held in front of the Tham Luang cave to mark the fifth anniversary of the search and rescue mission.[238] The cave system was then reopened in phases for public access and adventure tourism.[239] The first two chambers were opened to the public in July 2023, with large groups guided as far as Chamber 1 multiple times a day, while smaller groups could visit Chamber 2 on pre-booked guided tours.[240] Limited tours to the third chamber, which served as the hub of the rescue operation, began in December 2023.[241][242] Accompanied by licensed tour guides, small numbers of tourists can experience the obstacles encountered by the rescue teams and understand the extremely complicated rescue work that was carried out in July 2018.[242] The equipment used by the divers, including ropes, cables and oxygen tubes, remains untouched as exhibits for the visitors to view for themselves.[243] The area after Chamber 3 remains closed to the public, but there are plans to open it up further in the future for more experienced cavers to explore.[243] Back at the cave entrance, display boards give details of the rescue operation, and some of the bicycles are still standing where the boys left them on the day they entered the cave.[242] Following the incident, cave-diving was incorporated into the training regime for Thailand's Navy SEALs to better prepare them for similar emergencies.[244] As three of the boys and their assistant coach were stateless, officials promised that the four would be granted Thai citizenship within six months,[34] and this happened on 26\u00a0September 2018.[35] The Thai government vowed to end statelessness by 2024.[245]"

        "content": "Typhoon Chanthu, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Kiko,[1] was the second most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2021 after Typhoon Surigae in April. It impacted the Cagayan Valley region of the Philippines and became the strongest typhoon to affect the Batanes province since Typhoon Meranti in 2016. The twenty-ninth tropical depression, fourteenth named storm and fourth typhoon of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season, Chanthu originated from a disturbance well east of the Philippine islands on September 5 which organized into a tropical depression later that day. By the next day, the depression had formed into a mature tropical storm which began to explosively intensify by September 7, featuring a pinhole eye on satellite, characteristic of rapidly intensifying storms. Chanthu became a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon by September 8, the highest category on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Subsequent eyewall replacement cycles caused intensity fluctuations, but on September 10, Chanthu peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph) just northeast of extreme northeastern Luzon. The typhoon passed very near the Babuyan Islands before passing directly over Ivana, Batanes as a weakening but still powerful Category 5-equivalent super typhoon. Chanthu continued steadily weakening as it passed just east of Taiwan and eventually stalled just east of Shanghai, China. The storm eventually made its second and final landfall near Ikitsuki, Nagasaki in Japan, before crossing the country's mountainous terrain and becoming an extratropical cyclone on September 18. Chanthu then continued eastward and curved southward, before dissipating on September 20. According to Aon Benfield, economic losses totaled US$30 million.[2]"

        "content": "At 06:00 UTC on September 5, the JTWC began to monitor an area of disturbed weather that had formed 446\u00a0nmi (513\u00a0mi; 826\u00a0km) from Legazpi, Philippines.[3] At 18:00 UTC the same day, the JMA declared the system a tropical depression.[4] Later in the day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the system's low-level circulation center and its surrounding convection had improved significantly in organization.[5] At 09:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, designating as 19W.[6] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm; they also noted the formation of an eye-like feature on satellite images.[7] The JMA later did the same at 00:00 UTC of September 7, providing the name Chanthu.[8] At 09:30 UTC, the PAGASA reported that Chanthu entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and was named Kiko.[9] At 12:00 UTC, as satellite based intensity estimates from the Dvorak technique increased, the JMA upgraded Chanthu to a severe tropical storm.[10] At the same moment, Chanthu started rapid intensification as it quickly became a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. Satellite imagery indicate a development of a vertical hot tower over its center, with microwave imagery indicating that it had developed a very small eye feature.[11][12] At 15:00 UTC, it had become a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, as it continued explosive intensification. A pinhole eye, a typical sign of a rapidly intensifying tropical cyclone, had developed by that time.[13] Six hours later, the typhoon reached Category 4 status, with one-minute sustained wind speeds of 125\u00a0kn (230\u00a0km/h; 145\u00a0mph).[14] By the next day, at 09:00 UTC, Chanthu had reached Category 5-equivalent intensity, developing a 5\u00a0nmi (10\u00a0km; 5\u00a0mi)-wide eye which was by very intense convection,[15][16] making it the second super typhoon of the year and marking the storm's initial peak intensity. After reaching its initial peak, Chanthu was downgraded to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon at 09:00 UTC on September 9, as its highly compact eye started to become cloud-filled, indicating the start of an eyewall replacement cycle.[17] However, shortly after, Chanthu quickly re-intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon yet again at 09:00 UTC that day, as its eye became clear again.[18] On 05:00 PhST of September 11 (21:00 UTC of September 10), the PAGASA reported that Chanthu passed to the east of the Babuyan Islands;[19] at 08:30 PhST (00:30 UTC), Chanthu made landfall in Ivana, Batanes as a Category 5 super typhoon with 1-minute sustained winds of 270\u00a0km/h (165\u00a0mph) as the storm began to weaken slightly.[20][21]\nAt 15:00 UTC on September 11, Chanthu weakened to a Category 4-equivalent typhoon as it continued to move northward because of the presence of dry air.[22] It was further downgraded to a Category 3-equivalent typhoon by the JTWC on September 12 at 03:00 UTC as it moved towards the east coast of Taiwan, experiencing multiple eyewall replacement cycles, increasing wind shear and dry, stable air.[23] Three hours later, the PAGASA issued its last bulletin on the system since it had exited the PAR.[24] At 15:00 UTC, Chanthu weakened to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon as the dry air started to hamper the typhoon's convective structure. According to satellite imagery, the low-level circulation center had become ill-defined and the eye started to collapse.[25] The weakening trend of Chanthu continued as it moved further northward towards the Korean Peninsula because of increasing wind shear, dry air and cool sea surface temperatures.[26][27] At 09:00 UTC of September 13, Chanthu further weakened into a Category 1 typhoon as it moved further north towards Shanghai.[28] By 15:00 UTC, the eye of Chanthu had completely collapsed.[29] Chanthu remained quasi-stationary near Shanghai because of weak steering flow.[30][31] At 06:00 UTC the next day, the JMA downgraded Chanthu to a severe tropical storm as it moved southeastward.[32] Three hours later, the JTWC downgraded Chanthu to a tropical storm as its low-level circulation became partially exposed, with convection only remaining to the north and west.[33] At 12:00 UTC, the JMA further downgraded it to a tropical storm as it slowly moved south-eastward towards Japan.[34] At 00:00 UTC on September 15, due to decreasing wind shear and marginally favorable sea surface temperatures, Chanthu re-strengthened and was re-classified as a severe tropical storm that day.[35] After continued slow movement, on September 17 at 09:00 UTC, Chanthu made landfall near itsuki, Nagasaki in Japan.[36] It continued to move northward as it moved through the rugged Japanese islands, causing it to weaken significantly.[37] This caused the JMA to downgrade it to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC.[38] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression as it rapidly collapsed because of the rugged terrain; it was also undergoing extratropical transition.[39] On September 18 at 08:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final warning for the system, as the system became extratropical.[40] Afterward, Chanthu's remnant continued moving eastward and then curved southward, before dissipating on September 20."

        "content": "Following multiple outbreaks of tropical cyclone activity across the Western Pacific basin in September\u00a01987, a large ridge developed at unusually low latitudes of the basin, forcing the Intertropical Convergence Zone further south and making environmental conditions unfavorable for tropical cyclone formation. On October\u00a06, the monsoon trough began to re-establish itself around the 5th parallel north as the ridge receded northward. The next day, satellite imagery indicated that a low-pressure area embedded in the monsoon trough developed 350\u00a0km (215\u00a0mi) south of Yap. Although shower activity was initially displaced to the north of the low, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system, on the basis of increased circus outflow.[1] Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[2][nb 1] Within 24 hours of the issuance of the TCFA, thunderstorm activity gradually increased in coverage, and the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a010,[1] although post-season analysis from the JTWC indicated that this occurred six hours earlier than operationally estimated.[4] Despite a 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) displacement between the surface and upper-level circulations, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC.[1] Six hours later, the JMA followed suit.[5][nb 2] While moving north, the low-and upper-level centers of Kelly became better aligned on October\u00a011, which resulted in strengthening.[1] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, Kelly was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JMA.[2] Six hours later, the JTWC reported that Kelly attained typhoon intensity.[1] Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began to monitor the storm, with the agency assigning it the local name Oniang.[7] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a012, the JMA followed suit and classified the storm as a typhoon.[2] Twelve hours later, the JMA raised the intensity to 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), its peak intensity. After maintaining maximum intensity for 72 hours,[5] the storm's forwards motion started to decrease, and on October\u00a015, the typhoon turned to the north-northwest despite being forecast to recruve out to sea in response to a trough located over the Yellow Sea. At midday, the JTWC increased the intensity of Kelly to 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), equal to Category\u00a02 status on the United States-based Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, and its peak intensity. On October\u00a016, Kelly began to lose tropical characteristics and transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that day, the storm passed over Shikoku and then made landfall near Kobe while maintaining typhoon intensity.[1][8][2] Kelly then emerged into the Sea of Japan, and at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a017, the JTWC declared the system an extratropical cyclone.[1] The JMA did the same six hours later, but continued to track the system through October\u00a019.[2]"

        "content": " On 11 March 2011, at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC), a Mw\u00a09.0\u20139.1 undersea megathrust earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean, 72\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of the T\u014dhoku region. It lasted approximately six minutes and caused a tsunami. It is sometimes known in Japan as the \"Great East Japan Earthquake\" (\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u9707\u707d, Higashi nihon daishinsai), among other names.[en 1] The disaster is often referred to by its numerical date, 3.11 (read san ten ichi-ichi in Japanese).[31][32][33] It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900.[34][35][36] The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that may have reached heights of up to 40.5 meters (133\u00a0ft) in Miyako in T\u014dhoku's Iwate Prefecture,[37][38] and which, in the Sendai area, traveled at 700\u00a0km/h (435\u00a0mph)[39] and up to 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) inland.[40] Residents of Sendai had only eight to ten minutes of warning, and more than a hundred evacuation sites were washed away.[39] The snowfall which accompanied the tsunami[41] and the freezing temperature hindered rescue works greatly;[42] for instance, Ishinomaki, the city with the most deaths,[43] was 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) as the tsunami hit.[44] The official figures released in 2021 reported 19,759 deaths,[45] 6,242 injured,[46] and 2,553 people missing,[47] and a report from 2015 indicated 228,863 people were still living away from their home in either temporary housing or due to permanent relocation.[48] The tsunami caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, primarily the meltdowns of three of its reactors, the discharge of radioactive water in Fukushima and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents.[49][50] Many electrical generators ran out of fuel. The loss of electrical power halted cooling systems, causing heat to build up. The heat build-up caused the generation of hydrogen gas. Without ventilation, gas accumulated within the upper refueling hall and eventually exploded causing the refueling hall's blast panels to be forcefully ejected from the structure. Residents within a 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and a 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) radius of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated. Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6\u00a0billion.[51] The Bank of Japan offered \u00a515\u00a0trillion (US$183\u00a0billion) to the banking system on 14 March 2011 in an effort to normalize market conditions.[52] The estimated economic damages amounted to over $300 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in history.[53][54] According to a 2020 study, \"the earthquake and its aftermaths resulted in a 0.47 percentage point decline in Japan's real GDP growth in the year following the disaster.\"[55]"

        "content": "The magnitude 9.1 (Mw) undersea megathrust earthquake occurred on 11 March 2011 at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) in the north-western Pacific Ocean at a relatively shallow depth of 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi),[9][56] with its epicenter approximately 72\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of T\u014dhoku, Japan, lasting approximately six minutes.[9][10] The earthquake was initially reported as 7.9\u00a0Mw by the USGS before it was quickly upgraded to 8.8\u00a0Mw, then to 8.9\u00a0Mw,[57] and then finally to 9.0\u00a0Mw.[58][59] On 11 July 2016, the USGS further upgraded the earthquake to 9.1. Sendai was the nearest major city to the earthquake, 130\u00a0km (81\u00a0mi) from the epicenter; the earthquake occurred 373\u00a0km (232\u00a0mi) northeast of Tokyo.[9] The main earthquake was preceded by a number of large foreshocks, with hundreds of aftershocks reported. One of the first major foreshocks was a 7.2\u00a0Mw event on 9 March, approximately 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) from the epicenter of the 11 March earthquake, with another three on the same day in excess of 6.0\u00a0Mw.[9][60] Following the main earthquake on 11 March, a 7.4\u00a0Mw aftershock was reported at 15:08 JST (6:06 UTC), succeeded by a 7.9\u00a0Mw at 15:15 JST (6:16 UTC) and a 7.7\u00a0Mw at 15:26 JST (6:26 UTC).[61] Over 800 aftershocks of magnitude 4.5\u00a0Mw or greater have occurred since the initial quake,[62] including one on 26 October 2013 (local time) of magnitude 7.1\u00a0Mw.[63] Aftershocks follow Omori's law, which states that the rate of aftershocks declines with the reciprocal of the time since the main quake. The aftershocks will thus taper off in time, but could continue for years.[64] The earthquake moved Honshu 2.4\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft) east, shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 and 25\u00a0cm (4 and 10\u00a0in),[65][66][67] increased Earth's rotational speed by 1.8 \u03bcs per day,[68] and generated infrasound waves detected in perturbations of the low-orbiting Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer satellite.[69]\nInitially, the earthquake caused sinking of part of Honshu's Pacific coast by up to roughly a metre, but after about three years, the coast rose back and then kept on rising to exceed its original height.[70][71][72][73]"

        "content": "This megathrust earthquake was a recurrence of the mechanism of the earlier 869 Sanriku earthquake, which has been estimated as having a magnitude of at least 8.4\u00a0Mw, which also created a large tsunami that inundated the Sendai plain.[39][74][75] Three tsunami deposits have been identified within the Holocene sequence of the plain, all formed within the last 3,000 years, suggesting an 800 to 1,100 year recurrence interval for large tsunamigenic earthquakes. In 2001 it was reckoned that there was a high likelihood of a large tsunami hitting the Sendai plain as more than 1,100 years had then elapsed.[76] In 2007, the probability of an earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.1\u20138.3 was estimated as 99% within the following 30 years.[77] This earthquake occurred where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the plate beneath northern Honshu.[66][78] The Pacific Plate, which moves at a rate of 8 to 9\u00a0cm (3.1 to 3.5\u00a0in) per year, dips under Honshu's underlying plate, building large amounts of elastic energy. This motion pushes the upper plate down until the accumulated stress causes a seismic slip-rupture event. The break caused the sea floor to rise by several metres.[78] The magnitude of this earthquake was a surprise to some seismologists.[79] A quake of this magnitude usually has a rupture length of at least 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) and generally requires a long, relatively straight fault surface. Because the plate boundary and subduction zone in the area of the Honshu rupture is not very straight, it is unusual for the magnitude of its earthquake to exceed 8.5\u00a0Mw.[79] The hypocentral region of this earthquake extended from offshore Iwate Prefecture to offshore Ibaraki Prefecture.[80] The Japanese Meteorological Agency said that the earthquake may have ruptured the fault zone from Iwate to Ibaraki with a length of 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) and a width of 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi).[81][82] Analysis showed that this earthquake consisted of a set of three events.[83] Other major earthquakes with tsunamis struck the Sanriku Coast region in 1896 and in 1933. The source area of this earthquake has a relatively high coupling coefficient surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north, and south. From the averaged coupling coefficient of 0.5\u20130.8 in the source area and the seismic moment, it was estimated that the slip deficit of this earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260\u2013880 years, which is consistent with the recurrence interval of such great earthquakes estimated from the tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about 93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence, earthquakes in this area with magnitudes of about 7 since 1926 had only released part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the coupling coefficient is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami.[84] Most of the foreshocks are interplate earthquakes with thrust-type focal mechanisms. Both interplate and intraplate earthquakes appeared in the aftershocks offshore Sanriku coast with considerable proportions.[85]"

If harnessed, the seismic energy from this earthquake would power a city the size of Los Angeles for an entire year.[64] The seismic moment (M0), which represents a physical size for the event, was calculated by the USGS at 3.9\u00d71022 joules,[87] slightly less than the 2004 Indian Ocean quake. Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) calculated a peak ground acceleration of 2.99\u00a0g (29.33\u00a0m/s2).[88][en 2] The largest individual recording in Japan was 2.7\u00a0g, in Miyagi Prefecture, 75\u00a0km from the epicentre; the highest reading in the Tokyo metropolitan area was 0.16\u00a0g.[91]"

        "content": "Portions of northeastern Japan shifted by as much as 2.4 metres (7\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) closer to North America,[65][66] making some sections of Japan's landmass wider than before.[66] Those areas of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts.[66] A 400-kilometre (250\u00a0mi) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6 metres (2\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in), allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land.[66] One early estimate suggested that the Pacific plate may have moved westward by up to 20 metres (66\u00a0ft),[94] and another early estimate put the amount of slippage at as much as 40\u00a0m (130\u00a0ft).[95] On 6 April the Japanese coast guard said that the quake shifted the seabed near the epicenter 24 metres (79\u00a0ft) and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture by 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft).[96] A report by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, published in Science on 2 December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and the Japan Trench moved 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) east-southeast and rose about 7 metres (23\u00a0ft) as a result of the quake. The report also stated that the quake had caused several major landslides on the seabed in the affected area.[97] The Earth's axis shifted by estimates of between 10 and 25\u00a0cm (4 and 10\u00a0in).[65][66][67] This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day, the tilt of the Earth, and the Chandler wobble.[67] The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass.[98] The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia. Because of conservation of angular momentum, such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earth's rate of rotation.[99] These are expected changes[67] for an earthquake of this magnitude.[65][98] The earthquake also generated infrasound waves detected by perturbations in the orbit of the GOCE satellite, which thus serendipitously became the first seismograph in orbit.[69] Following the earthquake, cracks were observed to have formed in the roof of Mount Fuji's magma chamber.[100] Seiches observed in Sognefjorden, Norway were attributed to distant S waves and Love waves generated by the earthquake. These seiches began to occur roughly half an hour after the main shock hit Japan, and continued to occur for 3 hours, during which waves of up to 1.5 meters high were observed.[101] Soil liquefaction was evident in areas of reclaimed land around Tokyo, particularly in Urayasu,[102][103] Chiba City, Funabashi, Narashino (all in Chiba Prefecture) and in the Koto, Edogawa, Minato, Ch\u016b\u014d, and \u014cta Wards of Tokyo. Approximately 30 homes or buildings were destroyed and 1,046 other buildings were damaged to varying degrees.[104] Nearby Haneda Airport, built mostly on reclaimed land, was not damaged. Odaiba also experienced liquefaction, but damage was minimal.[105] Shinmoedake, a volcano in Kyushu, erupted three days after the earthquake. The volcano had previously erupted in January 2011; it is not known if the later eruption was linked to the earthquake.[106] In Antarctica, the seismic waves from the earthquake were reported to have caused the Whillans Ice Stream to slip by about 0.5 metres (1\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in).[107] The first sign international researchers had that the earthquake caused such a dramatic change in the Earth's rotation came from the United States Geological Survey which monitors Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) stations across the world. The Survey team had several GPS monitors located near the scene of the earthquake. The GPS station located nearest the epicenter moved almost 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft). This motivated government researchers to look into other ways the earthquake may have had large scale effects on the planet. Calculations at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory determined that the Earth's rotation was changed by the earthquake to the point where the days are now 1.8 microseconds shorter.[108]"

A magnitude 7.4\u00a0Mw at 15:08 (JST), 7.9\u00a0Mw at 15:15 and a 7.7\u00a0Mw quake at 15:26 all occurred on 11 March.[109] A month later, a major aftershock struck offshore on 7 April with a magnitude of 7.1\u00a0Mw. Its epicenter was underwater, 66\u00a0km (41\u00a0mi) off the coast of Sendai. The Japan Meteorological Agency assigned a magnitude of 7.4 MJMA, while the U.S. Geological Survey lowered it to 7.1 Mw.[110] At least four people were killed, and electricity was cut off across much of northern Japan including the loss of external power to Higashid\u014dri Nuclear Power Plant and Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant.[111][112][113] Four days later on 11 April, another magnitude 7.1 Mw aftershock struck Fukushima, causing additional damage and killing a total of three people.[114][115] On 7 December 2012 a large aftershock of magnitude 7.3\u00a0Mw caused a minor tsunami, and again on 26 October 2013 a small tsunami was recorded after a 7.1\u00a0Mw aftershock.[116] As of 16 March 2012 aftershocks continued, totaling 1887 events over magnitude 4.0; a regularly updated map showing all shocks of magnitude 4.5 and above near or off the east coast of Honshu in the last seven days[117] showed over 20 events.[118] As of 11\u00a0March\u00a02016[update] there had been 869 aftershocks of 5.0\u00a0Mw or greater, 118 of 6.0\u00a0Mw or greater, and 9 over 7.0\u00a0Mw as reported by the Japanese Meteorological Agency.[119] The number of aftershocks was associated with decreased health across Japan.[120] On 13 February 2021, a magnitude 7.1\u20137.3 earthquake struck off the coast of Sendai. It caused some damage in Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. One person was killed, and 185 were injured.[121][122]"

        "header": "Earthquake Warning System",
        "content": "One minute before the earthquake was felt in Tokyo, the Earthquake Early Warning system, which includes more than 1,000 seismometers in Japan, sent out warnings of impending strong shaking to millions. It is believed that the early warning by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) saved many lives.[126][127] The warning for the general public was delivered about eight seconds after the first P wave was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake occurred. However, the estimated intensities were smaller than the actual ones in some places, especially in Kanto, Koshinetsu, and Northern T\u014dhoku regions where the populace warning did not trigger. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, reasons for the underestimation include a saturated magnitude scale when using maximum amplitude as input, failure to fully take into account the area of the hypocenter, and the initial amplitude of the earthquake being less than that which would be predicted by an empirical relationship.[128][129][130][131] There were also cases where large differences between estimated intensities by the Earthquake Early Warning system and the actual intensities occurred in the aftershocks and triggered earthquakes. Such discrepancies in the warning were attributed by the JMA to the system's inability to distinguish between two different earthquakes that happened at around same time, as well as to the reduced number of reporting seismometers due to power outages and connection failures.[132] The system's software was subsequently modified to handle this kind of situation.[133]"

Thousands of people died and entire towns were devastated. The tsunami propagated throughout the Pacific Ocean region reaching the entire Pacific coast of North and South America from Alaska to Chile. Warnings were issued and evacuations were carried out in many countries bordering the Pacific. Although the tsunami affected many of these places, the heights of the waves were minor.[135][136][137] Chile's Pacific coast, one of the farthest from Japan at about 17,000 kilometres (11,000\u00a0mi) away, was struck by waves 2 metres (6.6\u00a0ft) high,[138][139][140] compared with an estimated wave height of 38.9 metres (128\u00a0ft) at Omoe peninsula, Miyako city, Japan.[38]"

        "content": "The tsunami warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency was the most serious on its warning scale; it was rated as a \"major tsunami\", being at least 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft) high.[141] The actual height prediction varied, the greatest being for Miyagi at 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) high.[142] The tsunami inundated a total area of approximately 561 square kilometres (217\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Japan.[143] The earthquake took place at 14:46 JST (UTC 05:46) around 67 kilometres (42\u00a0mi) from the nearest point on Japan's coastline, and initial estimates indicated the tsunami would have taken 10 to 30\u00a0minutes to reach the areas first affected, and then areas farther north and south based on the geography of the coastline.[144][145] At 15:55 JST, a tsunami was observed flooding Sendai Airport, which is located near the coast of Miyagi Prefecture,[146][147] with waves sweeping away cars and planes and flooding various buildings as they traveled inland.[148][149] The impact of the tsunami in and around Sendai Airport was filmed by an NHK News helicopter, showing a number of vehicles on local roads trying to escape the approaching wave and being engulfed by it.[150] A 4-metre-high (13\u00a0ft) tsunami hit Iwate Prefecture.[citation needed] Wakabayashi Ward in Sendai was also particularly hard hit.[151] At least 101 designated tsunami evacuation sites were hit by the wave.[39][152] Like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the damage by surging water, though much more localized, was far more deadly and destructive than the actual quake. Entire towns were destroyed in tsunami-hit areas in Japan, including 9,500 missing in Minamisanriku;[153] one thousand bodies had been recovered in the town by 14 March 2011.[154] Among the factors in the high death toll was the unexpectedly large water surge. The sea walls in several cities had been built to protect against tsunamis of much lower heights. Also, many people caught in the tsunami thought they were on high enough ground to be safe.[156] According to a special committee on disaster prevention designated by the Japanese government, the tsunami protection policy had been intended to deal with only tsunamis that had been scientifically proved to occur repeatedly. The committee advised that future policy should be to protect against the highest possible tsunami. Because tsunami walls had been overtopped, the committee also suggested, besides building taller tsunami walls, also teaching citizens how to evacuate if a large-scale tsunami should strike.[157][158] Large parts of Kuji and the southern section of \u014cfunato including the port area were almost entirely destroyed.[159][160] Also largely destroyed was Rikuzentakata, where the tsunami was three stories high.[161][162] Other cities destroyed or heavily damaged by the tsunami include Kamaishi, Miyako, \u014ctsuchi, and Yamada (in Iwate Prefecture), Namie, S\u014dma, and Minamis\u014dma (in Fukushima Prefecture) and Shichigahama, Higashimatsushima, Onagawa, Natori, Ishinomaki, and Kesennuma (in Miyagi Prefecture).[163][164][165][166][167][168][169] The most severe effects of the tsunami were felt along a 670-kilometre-long (420\u00a0mi) stretch of coastline from Erimo, Hokkaido, in the north to \u014carai, Ibaraki, in the south, with most of the destruction in that area occurring in the hour following the earthquake.[170] Near \u014carai, people captured images of a huge whirlpool that had been generated by the tsunami.[171] The tsunami washed away the sole bridge to Miyatojima, Miyagi, isolating the island's 900 residents.[172] A 2 metres (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) high tsunami hit Chiba Prefecture about 2+1\u20442 hours after the quake, causing heavy damage to cities such as Asahi.[173] On 13 March 2011, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) published details of tsunami observations recorded around the coastline of Japan following the earthquake. These observations included tsunami maximum readings of over 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft) at the following locations and times on 11 March 2011, following the earthquake at 14:46 JST:[174] Many areas were also affected by waves of 1 to 3 metres (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in to 9\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) in height, and the JMA bulletin also included the caveat that \"At some parts of the coasts, tsunamis may be higher than those observed at the observation sites.\" The timing of the earliest recorded tsunami maximum readings ranged from 15:12 to 15:21, between 26 and 35\u00a0minutes after the earthquake had struck. The bulletin also included initial tsunami observation details, as well as more detailed maps for the coastlines affected by the tsunami waves.[175][176] JMA also reported offshore tsunami height recorded by telemetry from moored GPS wave-height meter buoys as follows:[177] On 25 March 2011, Port and Airport Research Institute (PARI) reported tsunami height by visiting the port sites as follows:[178] The tsunami at Ry\u014dri Bay (\u7dbe\u91cc\u6e7e), \u014cfunato reached a height of 40.1 metres (132\u00a0ft) (run-up elevation). Fishing equipment was scattered on the high cliff above the bay.[179][180] At Tar\u014d, Iwate, the tsunami reached a height of 37.9 metres (124\u00a0ft) up the slope of a mountain some 200 metres (660\u00a0ft) away from the coastline.[181] Also, at the slope of a nearby mountain from 400 metres (1,300\u00a0ft) away at Aneyoshi fishery port (\u59c9\u5409\u6f01\u6e2f) of Omoe peninsula (\u91cd\u8302\u534a\u5cf6) in Miyako, Iwate, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology found estimated tsunami run up height of 38.9 metres (128\u00a0ft).[38] This height is deemed the record in Japan historically, as of reporting date, that exceeds 38.2 metres (125\u00a0ft) from the 1896 Meiji-Sanriku earthquake.[182] It was also estimated that the tsunami reached heights of up to 40.5 metres (133\u00a0ft) in Miyako in T\u014dhoku's Iwate Prefecture. The inundated areas closely matched those of the 869 Sanriku tsunami.[183] Inundation heights were observed along 2,000 kilometres (1,200\u00a0mi) of the coast from Hokkaido to Kyushu in a 2012 study. Maximum run-up heights greater than 10 metres (33\u00a0ft) were distributed along 530 kilometres (330\u00a0mi) of coast, and maximum run-up heights greater than 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) were distributed along 200 kilometres (120\u00a0mi) of the coast, measured directly.[184] The tsunami resulted in significant erosion of the Rikuzen-Takata coastline, mainly caused by backwash. A 2016 study indicated that the coast has not naturally recovered at a desirable rate since the tsunami.[185] A Japanese government study found that 58% of people in coastal areas in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures heeded tsunami warnings immediately after the quake and headed for higher ground. Of those who attempted to evacuate after hearing the warning, only five percent were caught in the tsunami. Of those who did not heed the warning, 49% were hit by the water.[186] Delayed evacuations in response to the warnings had a number of causes. The tsunami height that had been initially predicted by the tsunami warning system was lower than the actual tsunami height; this error contributed to the delayed escape of some residents. The discrepancy arose as follows: in order to produce a quick prediction of a tsunami's height and thus to provide a timely warning, the initial earthquake and tsunami warning that was issued for the event was based on a calculation that requires only about three minutes. This calculation is, in turn, based on the maximum amplitude of the seismic wave. The amplitude of the seismic wave is measured using the JMA magnitude scale, which is similar to Richter magnitude scale. However, these scales \"saturate\" for earthquakes that are above a certain magnitude (magnitude 8 on the JMA scale); that is, in the case of very large earthquakes, the scales' values change little despite large differences in the earthquakes' energy. This resulted in an underestimation of the tsunami's height in initial reports. Problems in issuing updates also contributed to delays in evacuations. The warning system was supposed to be updated about 15 minutes after the earthquake occurred, by which time the calculation for the moment magnitude scale would normally be completed. However, the strong quake had exceeded the measurement limit of all of the teleseismometers within Japan, and thus it was impossible to calculate the moment magnitude based on data from those seismometers. Another cause of delayed evacuations was the release of the second update on the tsunami warning long after the earthquake (28 minutes, according to observations); by that time, power failures and similar circumstances reportedly prevented the update from reaching some residents. Also, observed data from tidal meters that were located off the coast were not fully reflected in the second warning. Furthermore, shortly after the earthquake, some wave meters reported a fluctuation of \"20 centimetres (7.9\u00a0in)\", and this value was broadcast throughout the mass media and the warning system, which caused some residents to underestimate the danger of their situation and even delayed or suspended their evacuation.[187][188] In response to the aforementioned shortcomings in the tsunami warning system, JMA began an investigation in 2011 and updated their system in 2013. In the updated system, for a powerful earthquake that is capable of causing the JMA magnitude scale to saturate, no quantitative prediction will be released in the initial warning; instead, there will be words that describe the situation's emergency. There are plans to install new teleseismometers with the ability to measure larger earthquakes, which would allow the calculation of a quake's moment magnitude scale in a timely manner. JMA also implemented a simpler empirical method to integrate, into a tsunami warning, data from GPS tidal meters as well as from undersea water pressure meters, and there are plans to install more of these meters and to develop further technology to utilize data observed by them. To prevent under-reporting of tsunami heights, early quantitative observation data that are smaller than the expected amplitude will be overridden and the public will instead be told that the situation is under observation. About 90 seconds after an earthquake, an additional report on the possibility of a tsunami will also be included in observation reports, in order to warn people before the JMA magnitude can be calculated.[187][188]"

Richard Lloyd Parry concluded the tragedy to be \"the ancient dialogue [...] between the entreating voices of women, and the oblivious, overbearing dismissiveness of old men\".[224] For the purpose of relief fund, an \"earthquake-related death\" was defined to include \"Physical and mental fatigue caused by life in temporary shelter\", \"Physical and mental fatigue caused by evacuation\", \"Delayed treatment due to an inoperative hospital\", \"Physical and mental fatigue caused by stress from the earthquake and tsunami\". A few cases of suicide are also included. Most of these deaths occurred during the first six months after the earthquake and the number dropped thereafter, but as time has passed, the number has continued to increase. Most of these deaths occurred in Fukushima Prefecture, where the prefectural government has suggested that they could be due to evacuations caused by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[225] Within Fukushima Prefecture, these indirect casualties have already resulted in more deaths than the number of people killed directly by earthquake and tsunami.[226][227][228]"

Rolling blackouts of approximately three hours were experienced throughout April and May while TEPCO scrambled to find a temporary power solution. The blackouts affected Tokyo, Kanagawa, Eastern Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Chiba, Ibaraki, Saitama, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures.[291] Voluntary reductions in electricity use by consumers in the Kanto area helped reduce the predicted frequency and duration of the blackouts.[292] By 21 March 2011, the number of households in the north without electricity fell to 242,927.[286] T\u014dhoku Electric Power was not able to provide the Kanto region with additional power because TEP's power plants were also damaged in the earthquake. Kansai Electric Power Company (Kepco) could not share electricity, because its system operated at 60 hertz, whereas TEPCO and TEP operate their systems at 50 hertz; the disparity is due to early industrial and infrastructure development in the 1880s that left Japan without a unified national power grid.[293] Two substations, one in Shizuoka Prefecture and one in Nagano Prefecture, were able to convert between frequencies and transfer electricity from Kansai to Kanto and T\u014dhoku, but their capacity was limited to 1 GW. With damage to so many power plants, it was feared it might be years before a long-term solution could be found.[294] To help alleviate the shortage, three steel manufacturers in the Kanto region contributed electricity produced by their in-house conventional power stations to TEPCO for distribution to the general public. Sumitomo Metal Industries could produce up to 500 MW, JFE Steel 400 MW, and Nippon Steel 500 MW of electric power.[295] Auto and auto parts makers in Kanto and T\u014dhoku agreed in May 2011 to operate their factories on Saturdays and Sundays and close on Thursdays and Fridays to help alleviate electricity shortages during the summer of 2011.[296] The public and other companies were also encouraged to conserve electricity in the 2011 summer months (Setsuden).[297] The expected electricity crisis in 2011 summer was successfully prevented thanks to all the setsuden measures. Peak electricity consumption recorded by TEPCO during the period was 49.22GW, which is 10.77GW (18%) lower than the peak consumption in the previous year. Overall electricity consumption during July and August was also 14% less than in the previous year.[298] The peak electricity consumption within TEP's area was 12.46GW during the 2011 summer, 3.11GW (20%) less than the peak consumption in the previous year, and the overall consumption have been reduced by 11% in July with 17% in August compared to previous year.[299][300][301] The Japanese government continued to ask the public to conserve electricity until 2016, when it is predicted that the supply will be sufficient to meet demand, thanks to the deepening of the mindset to conserve electricity among corporate and general public, addition of new electricity providers due to the electricity liberalization policy, increased output from renewable energy as well as fossil fuel power stations, as well as sharing of electricity between different electricity companies.[302][303][304]"

Cooling is needed to remove decay heat after a Generation II reactor has been shut down, and to maintain spent fuel pools. The backup cooling process is powered by emergency diesel generators at the plants and at Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant.[317] At Fukushima Daiichi and Daini, tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems at Fukushima Daiichi, including three large explosions and radioactive leakage. Subsequent analysis found that many Japanese nuclear plants, including Fukushima Daiichi, were not adequately protected against tsunamis.[318] Over 200,000 people were evacuated.[319] The discharge of radioactive water in Fukushima was confirmed in later analysis at the three reactors at Fukushima I (Units 1, 2, and 3), which suffered meltdowns and continued to leak coolant water.[49] The aftershock on 7 April caused the loss of external power to Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant and Higashidori Nuclear Power Plant but backup generators were functional.

Radioactive iodine was detected in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi, Gunma, Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, and Niigata, and radioactive caesium in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi and Gunma.[330][331][332] Radioactive caesium, iodine, and strontium[333] were also detected in the soil in some places in Fukushima. There may be a need to replace the contaminated soil.[334] Many radioactive hotspots were found outside the evacuation zone, including Tokyo.[335] Radioactive contamination of food products were detected in several places in Japan.[336] In 2021, the Japanese cabinet finally approved the dumping of radioactive water in Fukushima into the Pacific Ocean over a course of 30 years, with full support of IAEA.[337]"

A spill of a couple of litres of radioactive water occurred at Onagawa.[320] The number 2 reactor at T\u014dkai Nuclear Power Plant was shut down automatically.[316] On 14 March it was reported that a cooling system pump for this reactor had stopped working;[345] however, the Japan Atomic Power Company stated that there was a second operational pump sustaining the cooling systems, but that two of three diesel generators used to power the cooling system were out of order.[346]"

The expressway did not reopen to general public use until 24 March 2011.[347][348] All railway services were suspended in Tokyo, with an estimated 20,000 people stranded at major stations across the city.[349] In the hours after the earthquake, some train services were resumed.[350] Most Tokyo area train lines resumed full service by the next day\u201412 March.[351] Twenty thousand stranded visitors spent the night of 11\u201312 March inside Tokyo Disneyland.[352] A tsunami flooded Sendai Airport at 15:55 JST,[146] about one hour after the initial quake, causing severe damage. Narita and Haneda Airport both briefly suspended operations after the quake, but suffered little damage and reopened within 24 hours.[277] Eleven airliners bound for Narita were diverted to nearby Yokota Air Base.[353][354] Various train services around Japan were also canceled, with JR East suspending all services for the rest of the day.[355] Four trains on coastal lines were reported as being out of contact with operators; one, a four-car train on the Senseki Line, was found to have derailed, and its occupants were rescued shortly after 8\u00a0am the next morning.[356] Minami-Kesennuma Station on the Kesennuma Line was obliterated save for its platform;[357] 62 of 70 (31 of 35) JR East train lines suffered damage to some degree;[273] in the worst-hit areas, 23 stations on 7 lines were washed away, with damage or loss of track in 680 locations and the 30-km radius around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant unable to be assessed.[358] There were no derailments of Shinkansen bullet train services in and out of Tokyo, but their services were also suspended.[277] The Tokaido Shinkansen resumed limited service late in the day and was back to its normal schedule by the next day, while the J\u014detsu and Nagano Shinkansen resumed services late on 12 March. Services on Yamagata Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 31 March.[359] Derailments were minimized because of an early warning system that detected the earthquake before it struck. The system automatically stopped all high-speed trains, which minimized the damage.[360] The T\u014dhoku Shinkansen line was worst hit, with JR East estimating that 1,100 sections of the line, varying from collapsed station roofs to bent power pylons, would need repairs. Services on the T\u014dhoku Shinkansen partially resumed only in Kant\u014d area on 15 March, with one round-trip service per hour between Tokyo and Nasu-Shiobara,[361] and T\u014dhoku area service partially resumed on 22 March between Morioka and Shin-Aomori.[362] Services on Akita Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 18 March.[363] Service between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori was restored by May, but at lower speeds due to ongoing restoration work; the pre-earthquake timetable was not reinstated until late September.[364] The rolling blackouts brought on by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had a profound effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10\u201320\u00a0minute intervals, rather than the usual 3\u20135\u00a0minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and completely shutting down others; notably, the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line, Yokosuka Line, S\u014dbu Main Line and Ch\u016b\u014d-S\u014dbu Line were all stopped for the day.[365] This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to come to work or get home. Railway operators gradually increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80% capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion."

There was no loss of life, although the tsunami resulted in damage to all 18 Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jets of the 21st Fighter Training Squadron.[376][377][378] Twelve of the aircraft were scrapped, while the remaining six were slated for repair at a cost of 80\u00a0billion yen ($1\u00a0billion), exceeding the original cost of the aircraft.[379] After the tsunami, elements of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force put to sea without orders and started rescuing those who had been washed out to sea. Tsunami plans were for the Japanese Self-Defence Force assets to be led, directed, and coordinated by local civic governments. However, the earthquake destroyed town halls (the seat of local municipal government), police, and fire services in many places, so the military not only had to respond to but also command rescues."

The tsunami resulted in over 340,000 displaced people in the T\u014dhoku region, and shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine, and fuel for survivors. In response, the Japanese government mobilized the Self-Defence Forces (under Joint Task Force \u2013 T\u014dhoku, led by Lieutenant General Eiji Kimizuka), while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors. Aid organizations in Japan and worldwide responded, with the Japanese Red Cross reporting $1\u00a0billion in donations. The economic impact included immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding, which has been estimated at \u00a510\u00a0trillion ($122\u00a0billion). In comparison to the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, the East Japan earthquake brought serious damage to an extremely wide range.[386] The aftermath of the twin disasters left Japan's coastal cities and towns with nearly 25\u00a0million tons of debris. In Ishinomaki alone, there were 17 trash collection sites 180 metres (590\u00a0ft) long and at least 4.5 metres (15\u00a0ft) high. An official in the city's government trash disposal department estimated that it would take three years to empty these sites.[387] In April 2015, authorities off the coast of Oregon discovered debris that was thought to be from a boat destroyed during the tsunami. The cargo contained yellowtail amberjack, a species of fish that lives off the coast of Japan, still alive. KGW estimates that more than 1\u00a0million tons of debris still remain in the Pacific Ocean.[388] In February 2016, a memorial was inaugurated by two architects for the victims of the disaster, consisting of a 6.5-square-metre structure on a hillside between a temple and a cherry tree in Ishinomaki.[389]"

        "content": "Seismologists anticipated a very large quake would strike in the same place as the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake\u2014in the Sagami Trough, southwest of Tokyo.[390][391] The Japanese government had tracked plate movements since 1976 in preparation for the so-called Tokai earthquake, predicted to take place in that region.[392] However, occurring as it did 373\u00a0km (232\u00a0mi) north east of Tokyo, the T\u014dhoku earthquake came as a surprise to seismologists. While the Japan Trench was known for creating large quakes, it had not been expected to generate quakes above an 8.0 magnitude.[391][392] The Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion set up by the Japanese government then reassessed the long-term risk of trench-type earthquakes around Japan, and it was announced in November 2011 that research on the 869 Sanriku earthquake indicated that a similar earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.4\u20139.0 would take place off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan, on average, every 600 years. Also, a tsunami-earthquake with a tsunami magnitude scales (Mt) between 8.6 and 9.0 (Similar to the 1896 Sanriku earthquake, the Mt for the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake was 9.1\u20139.4) had a 30% chance to occur within 30 years.[393][394] The quake gave scientists the opportunity to collect a large amount of data to model the seismic events that took place in great detail.[65] This data is expected to be used in a variety of ways, providing unprecedented information about how buildings respond to shaking, and other effects.[395] Gravimetric data from the quake have been used to create a model for increased warning time compared to seismic models, as gravity fields travel faster than seismic waves.[396] Researchers have also analysed the economic effects of this earthquake and have developed models of the nationwide propagation via interfirm supply networks of the shock that originated in the T\u014dhoku region.[397][398] After the full extent of the disaster was known, researchers soon launched a project to gather all digital material relating to the disaster into an online searchable archive to form the basis of future research into the events during and after the disaster. The Japan Digital Archive is presented in English and Japanese and is hosted at the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some of the first research to come from the archive was a 2014 paper from the Digital Methods Initiative in Amsterdam about patterns of Twitter usage around the time of the disaster. After the 2011 disaster, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction held its World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Tohoku in March 2015, which produced the Sendai Framework document to guide efforts by international development agencies to act before disasters instead of reacting to them after the fact. At this time Japan's Disaster Management Office (Naikakufu Bosai Keikaku) published a bi-lingual guide in Japanese and English, Disaster Management in Japan, to outline the several varieties of natural disaster and the preparations being made for the eventuality of each. In the fall of 2016, Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED; Japanese abbreviation, Bosai Kaken; full name Bousai Kagaku Gijutsu Kenkyusho) launched the online interactive \"Disaster Chronology Map for Japan, 416\u20132013\" (map labels in Japanese) to display in visual form the location, disaster time, and date across the islands. The Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project, a scientific expedition conducted in 2012\u20132013, drilled ocean-floor boreholes through the fault zone of the earthquake and gathered important data about the rupture mechanism and physical properties of the fault that caused the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.[399][400]"

The rarity and magnitude of the earthquake-tsunami prompted researchers Jotaro Urabe, Takao Suzuki, Tatsuki Nishita, and Wataru Makino to study their immediate ecological impacts on intertidal flat communities at Sendai Bay and the Sanriku Ria coast. Pre- and post-event surveys show a reduction in animal taxon richness and change in taxon composition mainly attributed to the tsunami and its physical impacts. In particular, sessile epibenthic animals and endobenthic animals both decreased in taxon richness. Mobile epibenthic animals, such as hermit crabs, were not as affected. Post-surveys also recorded taxa that were not previously recorded before, suggesting that tsunamis have the potential to introduce species and change taxon composition and local community structure. The long term ecological impacts at Sendai Bay and the greater east coast of Japan require further study.[401]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Edouard brought coastal and minor inland flooding to Louisiana and Texas in August\u00a02008. The fifth tropical cyclone and fifth named storm of the hurricane season, Edouard developed from a trough in the northern Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a03. After developing into a tropical depression, it gradually strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Edouard on August\u00a04. However, northerly wind shear initially halted any further significant intensification and also caused the storm to struggle to maintain deep convection over the center. Edouard eventually intensified further and peaked as a strong tropical storm with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a05. Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall near Gilchrist, Texas later that day. Edouard quickly weakened and was downgraded to tropical depression by early on August\u00a06, six hours before degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. Due to the relatively weak nature of the storm, impact was generally minor. Rip currents in Alabama and Florida led to five fatalities. The sixth death from the storm was also related to rough seas and occurred near the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Storm surge and high tides also caused coastal flooding in the state, especially in Cameron Parish. Relatively strong winds left more than 2,000\u00a0without electricity and damaged trees and the roofs of mobile homes. Storm surge caused coastal flooding in eastern Texas, particularly in the Gilchrist area. At least 25\u00a0homes sustained damage, while portions of a few major roads, such as Interstate 10, were closed. Minor inland flooding occurred due to heavy rainfall, with a portion of Texas State Highway 36 being temporarily shutdown. Strong winds in the region damaged hundreds of homes, downed trees, and left about 300,000\u00a0people without electricity. Overall, damage from Tropical Storm Edouard totaled slightly more than $550,000 (2008\u00a0USD)."

        "content": "On August\u00a02, 2008, a trough entered the northern Gulf of Mexico,[1] with a low pressure area developing near Apalachicola, Florida. The system maintained scattered deep convection across offshore waters and environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis.[1][2] The system tracked generally west-southwestward, due to its position south of a subtropical ridge extending from Texas through Florida.[3] On the afternoon of August\u00a03, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed the development of a well-defined center of circulation, slightly exposed from a disorganized area of thunderstorms.[4] As a result, the system developed into Tropical Depression Five at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03, while located about 85\u00a0miles (140\u00a0km) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River.[5] Because the depression was initially located in an area of northerly wind shear and dry air, the National Hurricane Center forecast it to slowly intensify.[4] After a burst in deep convection late on August\u00a03, Hurricane Hunter data indicated flight level winds of 65 miles per hour (105\u00a0km/h).[6] At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a04, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edouard. Later that day, convection temporarily decreased around the center, though a brief convective flare up on its east side occurred early on August\u00a05. Due to decreasing westerly wind shear, the center was nearly surrounded by convection that afternoon. Further organization continued and at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05, Edouard attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 996\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). Simultaneously, the storm made landfall at the McFaddin and Texas Point National Wildlife Refuges near Gilchrist, Texas at the same intensity. It weakened rapidly after moving inland and was downgraded to a tropical depression late on August\u00a05. Edouard then re-curved northwest over eastern Texas, before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06. The remnant low continued northwestward until dissipating over northern Texas early on August\u00a07.[5]"

At 2100\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03, a tropical storm watch was posted from Intracoastal City, Louisiana to Port O'Connor, Texas. Simultaneously, a tropical storm warning was issued from Intracoastal City to the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. The tropical storm watch was upgraded to a hurricane watch early on August\u00a04. Around that time, the tropical storm warning was extended from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Cameron, Louisiana. At 0900\u00a0UTC on August\u00a04, the tropical storm warning was revised to reach San Luis Pass, Texas. The hurricane watch was modified from Grand Isle, Louisiana to Sargent, Texas. The tropical storm warning was extended to include the mouth of the Mississippi River to Port O'Connor at 1500\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05. At that time, the tropical storm warning was modified again to stretch from San Luis Pass to Cameron. Late on August\u00a05, all tropical cyclones were discontinued.[5] In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil evacuated about 40\u00a0workers from drilling operations.[7] BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms in the western and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas.[8] Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17\u00a0Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200\u00a0National Guard troops, a 70\u00a0member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas.[9] Under the order, about 200\u00a0buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations.[10] Dow Chemical shut down their plants in Clear Lake and La Porte. The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August\u00a04.[8] Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency.[11] In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks.[7]"

Along the coast, storm surge in Louisiana generally ran 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5\u00a0m) above normal, although a slightly higher tide was reported near Intracoastal City. Due to the storm surge, part of Louisiana Highway 82 was closed between Holly Beach and Johnson Bayou. Additionally, Interstate 10 was also flooded by storm surge. Minor flooding from the surge traveled up the Calcasieu River to Lake Charles, where water flooded a local yacht club. Low-lying areas of Intracoastal City were flooded, disrupting marine industries.[12] A man fell overboard from a shrimp boat and died in rough seas from Edouard near the mouth of the Mississippi River.[5] This was the only death directly associated with Tropical Storm Edouard. Three locations reported tropical storm force winds, including 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) on Timbalier Island, 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) in Calcasieu Pass, and 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) on Marsh Island.

Due to the high winds, falling trees and power lines left at least 300,000\u00a0customers in Southeastern Texas without electricity, most of them in Jefferson County. Hundreds of homes also suffered damage.[12] Storm surge ranged between 2 and 5\u00a0feet (0.60\u20131.5 m) along the coast.[12] In addition, high surf battered the shore.[14] Minor storm surge flooding along portions of the Bolivar Peninsula caused $95,000 in damage. The coastal flooding forced the closure of and caused $5,000 in damage to Interstate 10 in Chambers County.[12][13] Near Baytown, water flooded a few garages. Additionally, at least 27\u00a0homes in Gilchrist flooded. Two mobile homes and fifteen single-family homes had 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) of water; as much as 18 inches (460\u00a0mm) of water was reported in ten other single-family houses.[12] At the McFaddin and Texas Point National Wildlife Refuges, losses in the park totaled to $100,000. Overall, effects from Tropical Storm Edouard in the state of Texas resulted in approximately $200,000 in damage.[12]"

        "content": " Typhoon Fred was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage in southeastern China in mid-August\u00a01994. Regarded as the worst typhoon to affect Zhejiang in 160\u00a0years, it originated as an area of disturbed weather over the open West Pacific on August\u00a013. The system moved west-southwest and developed into a tropical depression on August\u00a014. Early on August\u00a015, it intensified into a tropical storm. Fred intensified at a steady rate over the course of several days while moving toward the west. The storm intensified into a typhoon on August\u00a016 and into a super typhoon three days later. Late on August\u00a019, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the principal organization in the West Pacific, estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), meanwhile, assessed 1-minute sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph). After peaking in intensity, Fred veered to the north of Taiwan and struck the China mainland near Wenzhou early on August\u00a021. The system degraded once inland and dissipated near Wuhan on August\u00a022. As Fred treaded between Taiwan and Japan, it produced fringe effects in both countries. In Japan, heavy rainfall and strong winds caused damage to buildings and crops. This damage was exacerbated by an F2 tornado that injured 14\u00a0people. In Taiwan, severe weather left thousands without utilities and caused damage primarily to crops. A landslide killed three people, and two others went missing. The most significant impact by far occurred in southeastern China, particularly in Zhejiang Province. A significant storm surge combined with astronomical high tides to inflict catastrophic damage to coastal infrastructure. Protection mechanisms failed, allowing an overwhelming surge of water to flow into 189\u00a0towns, including the port city of Wenzhou. In conjunction with flooding induced by swollen rivers, these floods impacted some 11\u00a0million people, of which 2.11\u00a0million were stranded by water. The combination of wind and rain damaged 700,000\u00a0homes and collapsed 100,000 more. Thousands of kilometers of electricity lines, embankment, and highway were damaged. Up to 300,000\u00a0ha (741,000 acres) of land were damaged, and some 367,000 livestock were killed. Along the storm path, 1,815 casualties were recorded, including 1,248 deaths, primarily focused on Zhejiang, totaling 3,063 deaths. The damage total reached $1.19\u00a0billion, almost all of which occurred in China."

        "content": "At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a013, the JTWC issued their first significant tropical weather advisory on a nascent area of disturbed weather over the open West Pacific basin. The system initially embarked on a west-southwest track, moving along the southern side of a mid-level subtropical ridge.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014, the JMA began monitoring the system.[2] Four hours later, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, which was followed by their first advisory on newly formed Tropical Depression 19W at 06:00\u00a0UTC. Owing to its continued development, the tropical depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred by both the JMA and JTWC early on August\u00a015.[1] Most super typhoons in the West Pacific undergo at least one period of rapid intensification to reach their high-end intensities. Fred, however, only steadily intensified along its path across the basin. A tropical upper-tropospheric trough moved in tandem to the north of the storm, although it is unclear what effect this feature may have had on the cyclone's strength. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, the JMA upgraded Fred to a typhoon, a move replicated by the JTWC later that night as the storm first developed an eye on a weather satellite. By late on August\u00a019, Fred had further developed into a super typhoon. The JTWC estimated peak winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 27.32\u00a0inHg (925\u00a0mb) at this time. The JMA, meanwhile, assigned 10-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[1] As Fred intensified, its eye diameter did not shrink, a trait uncharacteristic compared to most typhoons. In fact, the size of its eye varied considerably, from as small as 21\u00a0km (13\u00a0mi) to as large as 71\u00a0km (44\u00a0mi) in diameter. The system's original course moved in the direction of Taiwan. While it was about 460\u00a0km (290\u00a0mi) southwest of Okinawa, however, Fred rapidly veered toward the north-northwest. As the system abruptly changed direction, it began to weaken quickly according to its shrinking eye on satellite and surface observations scattered throughout the southern Ryukyu Islands. However, this rate of weakening slowed as the typhoon made its final approach to the coastline of China.[1] During the early hours of August\u00a021, Fred made landfall about 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Wenzhou. It continued inland, weakening to a severe tropical storm early on August\u00a022,[3] and dissipating over the Yangtze River valley near Wuhan around 06:00\u00a0UTC that day.[1] The remnants of the storm curved northeast in combination with an approaching weather front, and impacts from those systems reached Japan on August\u00a026\u201327.[4]"

        "content": "Across the southern Ryukyu Islands of Japan, Fred produced heavy rain and strong winds on August\u00a019\u201321. Precipitation was greatest on Ishigaki-jim, reaching 222\u00a0mm (8.7\u00a0in) in Kabira Bay and 211\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) at Ishigaki Airport.[5] On Miyako-jima, wind gusts reached 187\u00a0km/h (116\u00a0mph). The storm destroyed 6 power utility poles and 827 power lines, leaving 11,200 customers without service.[6] An F2 tornado produced by the typhoon struck Irabu-jima on August\u00a020, destroying 1 home, damaging 34 others, and injuring 14 people. The tornado was estimated to be no more than 150\u00a0m (490\u00a0ft) wide and traveled along a 8.5\u00a0km (5.3\u00a0mi) path.[7][8] Damage throughout Miyako-jima reached \u00a5705.85\u00a0million.[6] A minimum pressure of 27.73\u00a0inHg (939.1\u00a0mbar) was observed on Ishigaki-jima.[9] Sustained winds on Iriomote-jima reached 116\u00a0km/h (72\u00a0mph) with gusts recorded at 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) shortly before the anemometer failed. Across the island, two buildings were destroyed while seventeen others suffered extensive damage. Landslides blocked off two roads, creating traffic difficulties. Power outages affected 227 customers. Damage across Iriomote-jima amounted to \u00a5439.98\u00a0million, including agricultural damage that reached \u00a5388.24\u00a0million.[9] A plume of moisture associated with the typhoon extended northeast toward another area of low pressure and led to locally heavy rainfall up to 252\u00a0mm (9.9\u00a0in) in Ibaraki Prefecture. Approximately, 100 buildings were affected by the floods, 1 of which was destroyed.[10] The extratropical remnants of Fred brought heavy rain to Hokkaido on August\u00a026\u201327. Rainfall of 96\u00a0mm (3.8\u00a0in) in Imakane caused flooding which damaged agricultural institutions. Losses reached \u00a55.885\u00a0million in the Hiyama Subprefecture.[4]"

        "content": "In advance of Typhoon Fred, some 130 illegal Chinese deckhands working on Taiwanese fishing boats were allowed to take shelter on the island. Prior to Fred, these workers \u2013 hired as cheap labor and harbored on floating hotels \u2013 were barred from entering Taiwan. However, following the deaths of several deckhands caused by a previous typhoon that capsized a ship offshore, these workers were allowed to seek refuge onshore.[11][12] The cyclone's core remained north of the island, but Taiwan nonetheless felt peripheral effects from the storm. Along the coastline, maximum significant wave heights reached 7.59\u00a0m (24.9\u00a0ft).[13] These waves induced a significant drop in phytoplankton along the northern coastline of Taiwan, disturbing coastal marine ecosystems.[14] Across Taiwan, domestic air traffic was disrupted on the day of Fred's closest approach, but international air traffic, most rail, and most highway traffic remained minimally affected. Authorities in the northern portion of the country released water from reservoirs to prevent overflowing. This move followed a series of three typhoons that affected the region earlier in 1994, causing excessive flooding that left 20\u00a0people dead and $346\u00a0million in damage across the central and southern portions of Taiwan.[11] Fred produced 180\u00a0mm (7.1\u00a0in) of rain across the northern sections of the island.[15] The severe weather left 100,000\u00a0families without power and 21,000\u00a0households without telephone service. About NT$22\u00a0million in agricultural products were destroyed.[3] Three people were killed when a landslide collapsed a portion of a highway; this was one of many landslides observed in the wake of the storm.[12] Two people went missing,[3] including a 17-year-old boy last seen at a pier in Taitung County.[11] Another person was injured.[3] The compounded effects of Fred and previous cyclones raised concerns that Taiwan's third quarter GDP growth would be negatively affected.[15]"

        "content": "As the storm approached, the Zhejiang Provincial Military Command urged officers of the People's Liberation Army to be on full alert, and contingents began evacuating residents.[16] Fred's arrival came after a series of devastating floods throughout Southern China killed over 4,000\u00a0people and caused $6.1\u00a0billion in damage over preceding months.[16] The typhoon's effects were concentrated in the Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Fujian provinces across the southeastern section of China, where Fred was described as the region's worst in 160\u00a0years and contributed to the most severe flooding across the southeastern provinces in 70\u00a0years.[17][18] A total of 1,815 casualties were recorded,[19] and 1,248\u00a0people were killed.[20] Total damage reached $1.18\u00a0billion.[3] The vast majority of damage and death in association with the typhoon occurred across the Zhejiang Province. As Fred approached, it produced tidal waves up to 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) which sunk 700\u00a0fishing vessels and damaged 900 more. This included a 1,000\u00a0ton fishing boat which was driven into a seawall.[3][21] Storm surge associated with the storm combined with local high astronomical tides to produce a cascading failure of coastal infrastructure throughout the Zhejiang province.[20] Within hours of the storm's landfall, nearly all first-tier seawalls collapsed, causing subsequent failure in second-tier seawalls and eventually third-tier seawalls as well.[21] Over 520\u00a0km (320\u00a0mi) of dike was damaged, nearly half of which was destroyed.[20] The overwhelming surge of water flowed into 189\u00a0towns.[22] The floods moved through homes at night, when many people could not flee. As a result, 1,216 of the storm's deaths were concentrated in the Zhejiang province.[20] In the port city of Wenzhou, 3,370 embankments were broken, severing the city's power and water supply and disrupting travel by land, sea, and air. The waiting hall of the Wenzhou Longwan International Airport was flooded to a depth of 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft), and the building was shut down for at least 15\u00a0days due to the destruction of critical equipment. Furthermore, the combination of the surge and ongoing rainfall led to the overflowing of the Oujiang River, which soon consumed the fragile seawall that protected the most prosperous portions of Wenzhou. Tides in the affluent areas rose to 1.5\u20132.5\u00a0m (4.9\u20138.2\u00a0ft), causing additional, severe flood damage to homes and businesses. A ship washed into the city's roads. At the mouth of the Oujiang River, Lingkun, Jiangxin, and Qidu islands were submerged by a tide of 2\u20133\u00a0m (6.6\u20139.8\u00a0ft) above ground level and remained inundated until the next day.[21] The floods prompted a shortage of vegetables throughout the city's market.[23] Trees were downed, train tracks were cut off, and roads were washed out or covered by mudslides. Port facilities floated out to sea as significant erosion affected the coastline. The tide levels in Wenzhou and Rui'an exceeded historically measured high tides by 0.65\u00a0m (2.1\u00a0ft) and 0.21\u00a0m (0.69\u00a0ft), respectively. The tide level in the Longwan District peaked at a height estimated to occur every 200\u00a0years.[21] In total, Fred affected 48\u00a0counties,[24] causing impact to over 11\u00a0million people.[25] Up to 300,000\u00a0ha (741,000 acres) of land were damaged.[26] Torrential rainfall, spread across four days and lasting up to 43 consecutive hours in some places, totaled to 678\u00a0mm (26.7\u00a0in).[27][28] About 2.11\u00a0million people were stranded by floods, and an additional 56,000\u00a0people were evacuated. Wind gusts as measured in Yuhuan reached 179\u00a0km/h (111\u00a0mph).[21] The combination of wind and flood laid waste to numerous structures, with 700,000\u00a0housing units damaged and an additional 100,000\u00a0units collapsed.[25] The storm ruined about 141,130\u00a0ha (348,750 acres) of farmland.[16] It damaged 4,681\u00a0km (2,909\u00a0mi) of electricity lines, 2,397\u00a0km (1,489\u00a0mi) of embankment, and 1,056\u00a0km (656\u00a0mi) of highway.[25] In the Zhejiang province, about a quarter of its 42\u00a0million people were affected.[29] Some 425\u00a0ha (1,050 acres) of fish farm were destroyed, and 367,000\u00a0heads of livestock were lost. Irrigation works were damaged. In the neighboring Jiangsu Province, trees were likewise toppled, electric poles were downed, and cotton fields were flattened in the cities of Shanghai and Suzhou.[16] In the aftermath of the storm, the Government of China did not immediately request international assistance. Instead, local and regional authorities organized shelter and provided food for victims.[25] President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng dispatched a delegation of high-ranking Chinese leaders to inspect damage and express sympathy to the victims of the storm. Special work teams began the process of restoring electricity, telephone, railway service, and overarching transport throughout the region. Soldiers assisted in rescue effort as well.[16] The Red Cross Society of China distributed relief items and organized mobile medical teams.[25] Residents lined up at the Huangshi Village to receive rice provided by the government. The Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Li Zemin, and the former secretary Wang Siai, in addition to the mayor of the district, Chen Xiaohua, all toured damage in the Longwan District.[21] The Chinese leader heading flood relief, Chen Junsheng, warned officials to be on alert for profiteering and looting. He also suggested improving health services to stave off outbreaks of cholera or dysentery.[30] Fred followed a series of significant weather disasters across China during the first six months of China. Combined, these events led to a 25\u00a0percent increase in market prices. Fearing that these price increases would disillusion the Chinese citizenry toward the objectives of the government, the country's government issued an urgent statement calling for measures to reduce the prices of vegetables, pork, and other foods as fears spread that a food scarcity in China would become a global issue.[31] The Ministry of Agriculture in Beijing sought to minimize grain losses in particular, which had already suffered severe losses in preceding months as the worst drought in 60\u00a0years affected portions of China.[32] The country pledged there would be no additional adjustments in the second half of the year following Fred.[33] Despite efforts to quell uncertainty, the Chinese government nonetheless faced questions regarding its effectiveness following the catastrophes. While market-oriented reforms implemented by Deng Xiaoping boosted rural and urban prosperity alike, the dismantling of communes restricted the ease of constructing dams, dikes, and water irrigation channels, resulting in a steady degradation of rural infrastructure. The effects of overcrowding resulted in the construction of homes in flood prone areas. These moves amplified Fred's destructiveness.[34]"

This outbreak produced numerous tornadoes across Alabama and Georgia. This was the deadliest and strongest tornado of this outbreak, and the 8th deadliest in Alabama state history.[5] The tornado first touched down at 2:00\u00a0p.m. CST (3:00\u00a0p.m. EST) near Society Hill, Alabama, and stayed on the ground for 76 minutes over a 68.6 miles (110.4\u00a0km) path,[1][2] ravaging numerous homes and businesses, as well as doing significant tree damage. The tornado killed 23 people along the path, all of them in Alabama, and injured nearly 100 along the entire extent of the path.[6] The tornado was 1,600 yards (1,500\u00a0m) at its widest point.[1] The tornado continued into Georgia, causing up to EF3 damage in some areas. The tornado lasted 47 minutes in Georgia and traveled 42 miles (68\u00a0km) before lifting near Talbotton, Georgia at 3:16\u00a0p.m. CST (4:16\u00a0p.m. EST).[2]"

        "content": "A week before the event took place, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) noted that there may be a convective event in their day\u00a08[note 1] outlook, but there was not enough confidence to issue a 15% outlined area. The SPC continued with this wording but no outline until 3 days before the event, when the SPC outlined a large 15% risk area for most of Alabama and Mississippi, as well as some states westward.[7] The confidence in the forecasts continued to grow on a potential for several tornadoes, some being strong over a small corridor of Southern and Eastern Alabama and Central Georgia, where they issued an enhanced risk (level 3 out of 5). They also expanded the slight risk further to the east and south. The SPC maintained an enhanced risk through day 1, and expanding in all directions to include a larger area.[7] However, this event could have verified as a high risk had the SPC chosen to issue one.[8] The 12z surface analysis indicated that a broad area of low pressure was located over the far western Carolinas. An inland stationary front, baroclinic zone and an associated warm front extending southwestward across north-central Georgia to extreme southeast Texas. There, a surface low carrying a powerful cold front with arctic air and wintry weather southward. The entire feature was moving to the northeast.[9] Significant convective available potential energy (CAPE) was noted offshore in the 12z SPC mesoanalysis. By 18z as the front lifted northward, CAPE of 1000-2500 j/kg was noted over inland areas in the mesoanalysis. Combined with strong 0\u20136\u00a0km bulk shear of about 50 knots (58\u00a0mph) and Storm Relative Helicity of 300-500 m2/s2, the environment was more than favorable for the development of semi-discrete supercells within a squall line capable of producing several potentially strong tornadoes.[7][10] At 9:59\u00a0a.m. CST, the SPC issued a mesoscale convective discussion (MCD) giving a 95% chance of a tornado watch being issued for southern Alabama, southwestern Georgia, and northwestern Florida. The SPC noted the potential for a few potentially strong tornadoes in southern Alabama into west-central Georgia. This included the area where this tornado went over. The SPC cited that several radars had strong, curved hodographs with little weakness in them; indicative for this strong tornado potential.[11] Nearly 2 hours later, the SPC issued a tornado watch for Southern Alabama into Northwest Florida.[12] Less than an hour later, the SPC also issued a tornado watch for a large portion of central Georgia, and a small part of the central Florida Panhandle.[13] Both of these watches cited that \"A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible\", and had an 80% chance of 2 or more tornadoes, and a 50% chance of 1 or more significant (EF2 or higher) tornadoes.[12][13] A squall line of storms continued to develop along the cold front, with semi-discrete supercells embedded within the line. A few discrete supercells were also noted on radar imagery in southern Georgia, and another developing supercell over Alabama that would later produce this tornado.[7] Significant tornado parameters[note 2] increased along the line where the embedded discrete supercell was located was consistently at a 3 to a 4. In addition, a local increase of storm relative helicity to 600 also aided in the development in the strong tornado. All of these parameters in place increased the tornado potential in this area, as noted by an MCD that was issued for a small area exactly 1 hour before the tornado touched down. The SPC noted that the shear and CAPE were maximized, and that strong tornadogenesis will likely occur \"within the next 30-60 minutes\".[7][14] The environment continued to become better suited for a tornado, and at 2:00\u00a0p.m. CST, the tornado touched down near Society Hill, Alabama."

The National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama noted that \"a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado was located near Tuskegee National Forest\".[15] At 2:00 pm CST, the tornado touched down just southwest of Rogers Road and just northeast of US 80 in northeast Macon County. The tornado produced EF0 to EF1 damage to trees. The tornado moved over the Macon/Lee County line at 2:03 PM CST as an EF1 tornado, and uprooted trees. A minute later along County Road 29 in Alabama, the tornado remained at EF1 strength. A small church had its doors blown in, the roof removed, and a quarter of the cinder block walls were collapsed. Several trees were here uprooted as well. The tornado intensified as it moved east towards County Road 11, snapping and debarking tree trunks. There was also a barn that had significant loss of roofing material and a home that lost some shingles along C.R. 11. It is noted that weak ground rowing was beginning to be observed at this location. Debris began to spread to the east of C.R. 11, and this is the same time that a debris signature became evident on radar. At this time, the National Weather Service upgraded the tornado warning to a Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) tornado warning with a radar confirmed tornado. The warning stated that there was \"a confirmed large and extremely dangerous tornado\" was on the ground.[1][15][16] One minute later at 2:07 PM CST, the tornado reached its peak intensity immediately south of the intersection of Lee County Road 36 and Lee County Road 39. Numerous large trees snapped at their bases, as well as large trees with very expansive root systems being uprooted and fallen. This area of trees was given a low-end EF4 rating, with estimated winds at 167 miles per hour (269\u00a0km/h). In this area, high-end EF3 damage was observed to numerous homes in the area. A manufactured home was rolled, and its contents were emptied nearby on the track's northern side. In addition, five homes within close proximity where all walls were collapsed, with debris tossed a short distance away from the foundation of the homes. A car was mangled beyond recognition, and the frame was wrapped around the stub of a snapped and debarked tree. The tornado passed over a small lake. Across the small lake, two houses were leveled. The debris was removed from the foundation. The anchor bolt screws remained intact on these homes. These two homes received a low-end EF4 rating with 170 miles per hour (270\u00a0km/h) winds estimated. Two other houses near the northern path of the tornado were also surveyed. There was considerable damage to these homes, and they received EF3 ratings. The storm crossed County Road 39 slightly weaker but still producing significant damage to numerous homes and trees in the area. The tornado paralleled C.R. 39, where two manufactured homes were demolished, and its debris being scattered. The metal frames of these homes could not be located. There was also severe timber damage to the north of the road. Here, only a badly metal frame to a mobile home remained. A mattress was wrapped a stub of a tree. Nearby a tractor trailer rig was on its side and shoved around a sturdy tree while a nearby site-built home lost nearly all of its exterior walls with debris remaining on or near the home site. There was also evidence of ground scouring here.[1] The tornado then crossed SR 51 at high-end EF3 strength. Here, a double-wide manufactured home was moved off of its base and the exterior walls collapsed on a family residence. There was also severe tree damage with large trees being snapped at the bases. The tornado crossed nearby County Road 38, entering a heavily wooded area, causing significant tree damage. There was also some damage to surrounding homes. At this time, the National Weather Service upgraded the active PDS tornado warning to a rare tornado emergency, stating that a \"large and destructive tornado was located near Griffen Mill, or 11 miles southeast of Auburn, moving east at 60 mph.\" A minute later, the tornado exited the wooded area after snapping several trees. It crossed County Road 100, causing significant tree damage and ripping the roof off of a house and shifting another house off of its foundation. It then crossed County Road 166, demolishing several manufactured homes in that area and continuing to produce significant tree damage.[1][15] As the tornado progressed over a wooded area and reached County Road 165, a family residence suffered severe damage as the exterior walls were collapsed, and another home suffered severe roof damage. A mobile home was also flipped, and its debris scattered about. As the tornado continued moving northeastward, tree damage Continued to occur. It reached County Road 175, where a home suffered significant loss of roofing, and trees were snapped at the trunks. The tornado weakened as it crossed County Road 240, where damage to homes and trees continued. It moved over a rural area crossing County Roads 245 and 179, causing tree damage and minor roof damage. The tornado then passed through northern areas of Smiths Station. Less significant damage occurred than previously happened. A mobile home was flipped, and several constructed homes suffered roofing and siding damages. Tree damage also continued to occur. The tornado moved over rural areas, continuing its timber and tree damage. The tornado approached the Chattahoochee River, where it caused roof damage to a few homes in that area. Significant tree damage was also observed here. The tornado crossed the river and continued in Georgia.[1][16]"

        "content": "The tornado crossed the Alabama/Georgia border at the Chattahoochee River 29 minutes after tornadogenesis occurred. At 3:29 PM EST after crossing the river, the tornado continued moving quickly to the east-northeast, causing a wide swath of trees being uprooted or snapped near the base of the ground. The tornado was consistently an EF1 during this time. The tornado rapidly strengthened during the next 10 minutes. At 3:39 PM EST the tornado crossed Highway 27 and caused a swath of EF3 damage to pine trees, and toppled a cellular tower. In addition, 12 metal guidewires over 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) thick were snapped.[2] The tornado weakened immediately after this back down to an EF1 intensity. A wide swath of hundreds of snapped and uprooted trees persisted along this portion of the track to the south and west of Ellerslie, Georgia. Minor roof damage was reported on several homes along the path in this rural area of Georgia. The tornado reached the southern side of Ellerslie at 3:47 PM EST. The tornado continued to parallel Highway 315 where hundreds more trees were snapped or uprooted. Some shingles were pulled off of several homes, with one home sustaining damage to the top floor. The tornado continued to push Northeastward, were numerous trees were downed. Another home sustained severe damage to the top floor, with several homes nearby sustaining minor shingles, and a carport being destroyed.[2] The tornado crossed Ridgeway Road, located just to the north of Highway 315. EF2 damage continued to be reported in this location, with dozens of softwood trees being snapped at their bases. The tornado eventually ran into Highway 315 as the highway winds perpendicular to the tornado's path at this point. The tornado continued causing EF1 to EF2 damage to trees along a wide swath. At 3:54 PM EST, the tornado crossed into Talbot County, Georgia. The tornado continued its long swath of EF1 to EF2 damage. The tornado intensified again into an EF3 tornado, causing significant damage to a mobile trailer home, dozens of trees, and a two-story home. In addition, the Humble Zion Church was completely demolished. None of its brick and cinderblock walls were left standing. The tornado continued northeastward, weakening significantly. EF1 wind damage was found consistently through forested areas in and around Hwy 315, along Callier Rd, O'Neal Rd, and Mitchell Rd. The tornado then approached Talbotton, Georgia, continuing to cause moderate tree damage and minor roof damage to homes that were in the path.[2] At 4:03 PM EST, the tornado moved into the northern side of Talbotton. Trees were observed to be snapped going into town along Adams Road. The tornado intensified again as it headed into town. It intersected Washington Avenue, which is the main north\u2013south road in the town. It caused high-end EF2 damage in this area with several manufactured homes turned over and destroyed, sometimes mangled. It was unrecognizable where these manufactured homes originally sat. The contents from inside of these homes were blown over a quarter mile from where the homes were originally located. A single-family home was removed and twisted at least 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) off its foundation. The second story of this home was completely removed. The tornado then intensified further into an EF3 tornado, where two brick-and-mortar apartments were completely demolished. The slabs of these apartments were left completely bare after the tornado. Dozens of cars were also destroyed. Debris were blasted into the vehicles, and the windows were blown out. In addition, a sedan was overturned on to the side. Several homes lost roofs as well. The tornado continued moving northeast out of the town. Seven injuries were reported within the town. The tornado continued to be snapped and uprooted as it moved out of town and into wooded areas. Another manufactured home was overturned. The tornado moved into a small valley, snapping hundreds of trees. A few final trees were snapped at the end of the tornadoes life. Finally at 4:16 PM EST about 10.5 miles east-northeast of Talbotton, Georgia, the tornado dissipated."

        "content": " Typhoon Robyn, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Openg,[1] was a mid-season tropical cyclone that brushed Japan during August\u00a01993. Typhoon Robyn originated from a near equatorial monsoon trough in the eastern Caroline Islands in late July. Tracking west-northwest, a tropical depression developed on August 1, and became a tropical storm the next day. Following an increase in organization, Robyn obtained typhoon intensity on August\u00a05. The typhoon briefly tracked west before veering to the northwest while intensifying. On August 7, Robyn attained its peak intensity of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph), with a barometric pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg). After passing through the Ryukyu Islands, Robyn skirted past western Kyushu on August\u00a09 while steadily weakening. Midday on August\u00a010, Robyn lost typhoon intensity over the Sea of Japan. The next day, the system was declared an extratropical cyclone. In advance of the storm, 5,300\u00a0individuals were evacuated from Nagasaki Prefecture. Around 100\u00a0flights in and out of Kagoshima Airport were called off. Throughout Japan, nine people were killed, and fifty others were wounded. A total of 564\u00a0structures were destroyed, 80\u00a0homes were damaged, 220\u00a0houses were flooded, roads were cut in 15\u00a0locations, and two dikes were ruined. On the island of Kyushu, over 10,000\u00a0people fled their homes and around 285,000\u00a0households lost electricity. Damage in the country totaled \u00a510.3\u00a0billion, equal to US$92.3\u00a0million.[nb 1][nb 2] In South Korea, 45\u00a0people were killed and damage was estimated at US$86\u00a0million.

        "content": "The sixth and final tropical cyclone of July, Robyn originated from a near equatorial monsoon trough in the eastern Caroline Islands. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a030, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started watching the system as thunderstorm activity had persisted[2] as the disturbance tracked west-northwest.[3] On the afternoon on July\u00a031, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued, following reports from Hurricane Hunters that a low-level center was forming.[2] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a01, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[4][nb 3][nb 4] Based on Dvorak classifications of T1.5/50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph), the JTWC followed suit several hours later.[2] Both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Robyn at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a02,[7] with the JTWC citing Dvorak estimates of T2.5/65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) as the reason for the upgrade. At the time of the upgrade, Robyn was located 465\u00a0km (290\u00a0mi) northwest of Chuuk.[2] Initially, Tropical Storm Robyn meandered erratically within a mesoscale convective system.[2] At noon on August\u00a03, the JMA upgraded Robyn into a severe tropical storm.[4] Banding features increased in coverage that afternoon as the storm itself slowed down. Early on August\u00a04, the JTWC estimated that Robyn attained typhoon intensity, although operationally, this was believed to have occurred 12\u00a0hours earlier, when Dvorak intensity estimates supported an intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Robyn then began to cease all westward movement and instead took a dive south, only to turn north and later northwest.[2] According to the JMA, Robyn leveled off in intensity for 30\u00a0hours, and did not become a typhoon until noon on August\u00a05.[4] Early on August\u00a06, data from the JTWC suggested that Robyn entered a period of rapid deepening over 36\u00a0hours, ending winds of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph). The JMA disagrees, noting that only slight intensification occurred during this period. On August\u00a07, the JMA estimated that Robyn attained its peak intensity of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph), with a barometric pressure of 945\u00a0mbar (27.9\u00a0inHg). Starting late on August\u00a07, the JTWC estimated that Robyn began a weakening trend, although according to the JMA, Robyn maintained its intensity through August\u00a08, with its pressure further dropping to 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg)[7] After passing through the Ryukyu Island, Robyn skirted past western Kyushu on August\u00a09 while steadily weakening.[3] Midday on August\u00a010, both the JTWC and JMA agreed that Robyn lost typhoon intensity over the Sea of Japan.[7] The next day, both the JTWC and JMA classified the system as an extratropical cyclone.[2][4]"

In Nagasaki Prefecture, about 5,300\u00a0people were evacuated from their homes at the foot of the Mount Unzen volcano due to fear of landslides. Under the anticipation of rough weather, about 100\u00a0flights out of Kagoshima Airport were canceled, with airports in numerous other prefectures also suspending flights.[8] The Kadena Air Base was evacuated at 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08.[2] Starting on August\u00a09, all bullet train services between Hakata and Hiroshima were suspended.[9] In addition to being one of three tropical cyclones to hit both Okinawa and Sasebo in 1993,[2] the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall across much of the Japanese archipelago,[10] which was already deluged by previous floods[11] that killed over 40\u00a0people.[12] A peak rainfall total of 651\u00a0mm (25.6\u00a0in) occurred at Nishiusuki District, including a record 595\u00a0mm (23.4\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours and 82\u00a0mm (3.2\u00a0in) in an hour.[13] A wind gust of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) was recorded in Miyake-jima.[14] A ship offshore Sasebo measured a minimum sea level pressure 969\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg).[2] Overall, nine people were killed, and fifty others were wounded.

They started burning in late July and lasted until early September 2010. The fires were associated with record-high temperatures, which were attributed to climate change[4]\u2014the summer had been the hottest recorded in Russian history[5]\u2014and drought.[6] Russian President Dmitry Medvedev declared a state of emergency in seven regions, and 28 other regions were under a state of emergency due to crop failures caused by the drought.[7] The fires cost roughly $15 billion in damages. A combination of the smoke from the fires, producing heavy smog blanketing large urban regions and the record-breaking heat wave put stress on the Russian healthcare system. Munich Re estimated that in all, 56,000 people died from the effects of the smog and the heat wave.[8] The 2010 wildfires were the worst on record to that time."

Temperatures of 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) first occurred after 12 June, which alone was an abnormality for the country (average mid-June temperatures seldom rise above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F)). In late June, Russian regions such as the Eurasian Sakha Republic, as well as areas of partial taiga, had temperatures of 38\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u2013104\u00a0\u00b0F). The warm ridging pattern then slowly moved westward to the Ural Mountains, and by July settled in European Russia. On 25 June a new temperature record was set in the Asian portion of Russia, at Belogorsk, Amur Oblast, at 42.3\u00a0\u00b0C (108.1\u00a0\u00b0F). The previous record in the Asian portion was 41.7\u00a0\u00b0C (107.1\u00a0\u00b0F) at Aksha on 21 July 2004. A new record for the highest nationwide temperature in Russia was set on 11 July, at 44\u00a0\u00b0C (111\u00a0\u00b0F), in Yashkul, Kalmykia (in the European portion), beating the previous record of 43.8\u00a0\u00b0C (110.8\u00a0\u00b0F) set on 6 August 1940, in Kalmykia.[9] Average temperatures in the region increased to over 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F). The mean high for European Russia recorded on 26 July reached 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day. During July 2010, a large portion of European Russia was more than 7\u00a0\u00b0C (12.6\u00a0\u00b0F) warmer than normal.[10] According to the director of the Global Fire Monitoring Centre (GFMC) Johann Goldammer, the wildfires were caused by \"negligent [human] behaviour\", such as lighting barbecues and fireworks in a densely wooded area.[11] Such human activity, coupled with the unusually high temperatures over the Russian territories, catalyzed this record disturbance."

What's happening with the planet's climate right now needs to be a wake-up call to all of us, meaning all heads of state, all heads of social organizations, in order to take a more energetic approach to countering the global changes to the climate.\"[18][19][20] Medvedev sacked some of his senior navy officers after one fire destroyed Russian navy equipment.[21][22] The officers were accused of \"incomplete professional responsibility\" after several buildings were allowed to burn down and vehicles and equipment destroyed.[23] He suggested anyone who had neglected their duties would be prosecuted.[24] On the same day it was reported that another fire was approaching a major secret nuclear research facility in the city of Sarov.[23] Environmental groups, such as the WWF, and \"non-systemic\" opposition politicians suggested firefighting has been slowed down by the Forest Code law passed by the Duma in 2006 at the order of Putin.[25] The legislation transferred responsibility for the country's vast woodlands to regional authorities, putting 70,000 forestry guards out of work.[26]"

Its primary goal was to prevent panic. This eerily reminded me of how the Soviet government reacted to the Chernobyl explosion in April 1986. In a similar manner, the authorities withheld information about the extent of the nuclear fallout to \"avoid panic\".[79] In some cases, no information about villages affected by wildfire was available for two weeks.[80] Doctors from several medical institutions in Moscow, interviewed by an Interfax correspondent, acknowledged that medical professionals were now forbidden to make a diagnosis of \"thermal shock\".[81] According to a Vedomosti poll on information about the fires in the newspapers, 68% of people said that they trusted online media such as blogs, 28% independent media, and only 4% government media.[82] Government Radio Mayak broadcast on 13 August: Vice-minister of Ministry of Emergency Situations Alexander Chupriyan said on Friday (13 August 2010) that the peat fires were extinguished completely in the Noginsk, Kolomna, Pavlovsky Posad and Orekhovo-Zuyevo areas near Moscow.[83] A volunteer wrote about the same events on 13 August 2010 in the Orekhovo-Zuyevo area in his blog: I have never seen such...Along the roads\u2014the burned forest.

Government officials said they could not have anticipated the heatwave, but critics blamed complacent officials for ignoring warnings of blazes near villages.[88] Sergey Robaten, Vadim Tatur, and Maksim Kalashnikov argued that the fires and the inability to contain and extinguish them was due to \"the inaction of bureaucrats\" and Putin's changing of how the Russian State Fire Service functions in 2001. Putin had transferred responsibility for fighting fires to those renting state property and the subjects of the federation, with the assumption that owners or renters would invest in whatever was necessary to prevent forest fires. However, the reality was more complex; Russian companies were seeking to turn a quick profit and thus neglected forest firefighting. Putin's spokesman remarked, \"this is a well-functioning system which only needs some minor adjustments\".[89][90]"

        "content": " The 1993 Storm of the Century (also known as the 93 Superstorm, The No Name Storm, or the Great Blizzard of '93/1993) was a cyclonic storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on March 12, 1993. The cold weather, heavy snowfall, high winds and storm surges that the storm brought affected a very large area; at its height, it stretched from Canada to Honduras.[1] The cyclone moved through the Gulf of Mexico and then through the eastern United States before moving on to eastern Canada. It eventually dissipated in the North Atlantic Ocean on March 15. Heavy snow was first reported in highland areas as far south as Alabama and northern Georgia, with Union County, Georgia reporting up to 35 inches (89\u00a0cm) of snow. Birmingham, Alabama, reported a rare 13\u00a0in (33\u00a0cm) of snow.[2][3] The Florida Panhandle reported up to around 6 inches to a foot of snow,[4] with hurricane-force wind gusts and record low barometric pressures. Between Louisiana and Cuba, the hurricane-force winds produced high storm surges across the Big Bend of Florida which, in combination with scattered tornadoes, killed dozens of people. Record cold temperatures were seen across portions of the Southern United States and Eastern United States in the wake of this storm. In the United States, the storm was responsible for the loss of electric power to more than 10\u00a0million households. An estimated 40\u00a0percent of the country's population experienced the effects of the storm[5] and it led to a total of 208 fatalities.[1] In all, the storm resulted in 318 deaths, and caused $5.5 billion (1993 USD) in damages. The greatest recorded snowfall amounts were at Mount Le Conte in Tennessee, where 56 inches (140\u00a0cm) of snow fell, and Mount Mitchell in North Carolina, the tallest mountain in eastern North America, where 50 inches (130\u00a0cm) were measured to fall and 15-foot (4.6\u00a0m) snow drifts were reported.[6]"

        "content": "A volcanic winter is thought to have started with the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The temperature in the stratosphere rose to several degrees higher than normal, due to the absorption of radiation by the aerosol. The stratospheric cloud from the eruption persisted in the atmosphere for three years. The eruption, while not directly responsible, may have played a part in the formation of the 1993 Storm of the Century.[7] During March 11 and 12, 1993, temperatures over much of the eastern United States began to drop as an arctic high pressure system built over the Midwestern United States and the Great Plains. Concurrently, an extratropical area of low pressure formed over Mexico along a stationary front draped west to east. By the afternoon of March 12, a defined airmass boundary was present along the deepening low. An initial burst of convective precipitation off the southern coast of Texas (facilitated by the transport of tropical moisture into the region) enabled initial intensification of the surface feature on March 12. Supported by a strong split-polar jet stream and a shortwave trough, the nascent system rapidly deepened.[8] The system's central pressure fell to 991\u00a0mbar (29.26\u00a0inHg) by 00:00\u00a0UTC on March 13. A powerful low-level jet over eastern Cuba and the Gulf of Mexico enhanced a cold front extending from the low southward to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Furthermore, the subtropical jet stream was displaced unusually far south, reaching into the Pacific Ocean near Central America and extending toward Honduras and Jamaica. Intense ageostrophic flow was noted over the southern United States, with winds flowing perpendicular to isobars over Louisiana.[8] As the area of low pressure moved through the central Gulf of Mexico, a short wave trough in the northern branch of the jet stream fused with the system in the southern stream, which further strengthened the surface low. A squall line developed along the system's cold front, which moved rapidly across the eastern Gulf of Mexico through Florida and Cuba.[8] The cyclone's center moved into north-west Florida early on the morning of March 13, with a significant storm surge in the northwestern Florida peninsula that drowned several people. This initially caused the storm to be a blizzard but also cyclonic. Barometric pressures recorded during the storm were low. Readings of 976.0 millibars (28.82\u00a0inHg) were recorded in Tallahassee, Florida, and even lower readings of 960.0 millibars (28.35\u00a0inHg) were observed in New England. Low pressure records for March were set in areas of twelve states along the Eastern Seaboard,[9] with all-time low pressure records set between Tallahassee and Washington, D.C.[10] Snow began to spread over the eastern United States, and a large squall line moved from the Gulf of Mexico into Florida and Cuba. The storm system tracked up the East Coast during Saturday and into Canada by early Monday morning. In the storm's wake, unseasonably cold temperatures were recorded over the next two days in the Southeast."

By March 8, 1993, several operational numerical weather prediction models and medium-range forecasters at the United States National Weather Service recognized the threat of a significant snowstorm. This marked the first time National Weather Service meteorologists were able to predict accurately a system's severity five days in advance. Official blizzard warnings were issued two days before the storm arrived, as shorter-range models began to confirm the predictions. Forecasters were finally confident enough of the computer-forecast models to support decisions by several northeastern states to declare a state of emergency even before the snow started to fall.[11]"

        "content": "The storm complex was large and widespread, affecting at least 26 US states and much of eastern Canada. It brought in cold air along with heavy precipitation and hurricane-force winds which, ultimately, caused a blizzard over the affected area; this also included thundersnow from Georgia to Pennsylvania and widespread whiteout conditions. Snow flurries were seen in the air as far south as Jacksonville, Florida,[12] and some areas of central Florida received a trace of snow. The storm severely impacted both ground and air travel. Airports were closed all along the eastern seaboard, and flights were cancelled or diverted, thus stranding many passengers along the way. Every airport from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Tampa was temporarily closed due to the storm. Highways were also closed or restricted all across the affected region, even in states generally well prepared for snow emergencies.[citation needed] Some affected areas in the Appalachian Mountain region saw 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) of snow, and snowdrifts as high as 35 feet (11\u00a0m).  Mount Le\u00a0Conte, Tennessee recorded 56\" and Mount Mitchell, NC recorded 50\u00a0in (130\u00a0cm) of snowfall. The volume of the storm's total snowfall was later computed to be 12.91 cubic miles (53.8\u00a0km3), an amount which would weigh (depending on the variable density of snow) between 5.4 and 27\u00a0billion tons. The weight of the record snowfalls collapsed several factory roofs in the South; and snowdrifts on the windward sides of buildings caused a few decks with substandard anchoring to fall from homes. Though the storm was forecast to strike the snow-prone Appalachian Mountains, hundreds of people were nonetheless rescued from the Appalachians, many caught completely off guard on the Appalachian Trail or in cabins and lodges in remote locales. Snowdrifts up to 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) were observed at Mount Mitchell. Snowfall totals of between 2 and 3 feet (0.61 and 0.91\u00a0m) were widespread across northwestern North Carolina. Boone, North Carolina\u2014in a high-elevation area accustomed to heavy snowfalls\u2014was nonetheless caught off-guard by more than 30 inches (76\u00a0cm) of snow and 24\u00a0hours of temperatures below 11\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212\u00a0\u00b0C). Boone's Appalachian State University closed that week, for the first time in its history. Stranded motorists at Deep Gap broke into Parkway Elementary School to survive, and National Guard helicopters dropped hay in fields to keep livestock from starving in northern N.C. mountain counties. In Virginia, the LancerLot sports arena in Vinton collapsed due to the weight of the record snowfall, forcing the Virginia Lancers of the ECHL to relocate to nearby Roanoke and become the Roanoke Express. Also collapsing were the roofs of a Lowe's store in Christiansburg and the Dedmon Center, at Radford University. Thousands of travelers were stranded along interstate highways in Southwest Virginia.[23]\nElectricity was not restored to many isolated rural areas for up to three weeks, with power outages occurring all over the east. Nearly 60,000 lightning strikes were recorded as the storm swept over the country for a total of 72 hours. As one of the most powerful, complex storms in recent history, this storm was described as the \"Storm of the Century\" by many of the areas affected.[citation needed] A hockey game hosted by the Philadelphia Flyers against the Los Angeles Kings was postponed due to a large window breaking from wind gusts just before the end of the first period.[24]"

        "content": "Besides producing record-low barometric pressure across a swath of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, and contributing to one of the nation's biggest snowstorms, the low produced a potent squall line ahead of its cold front. The squall line produced a serial derecho as it moved into Florida and Cuba shortly after midnight on March 13. Straight-line winds gusted above 100 miles per hour (87\u00a0kn; 160\u00a0km/h) at many locations in Florida as the squall line moved through. A substantial tree fall was seen statewide from this system. The supercells in the derecho produced eleven tornadoes. The first tornado was an F2 that touched down in Chiefland at 04:38\u00a0UTC on March 13, damaging several mobile homes and downing trees and power lines. Three people were killed and seven people sustained injures. Around the same time, an F1 tornado was spawned near Crystal River. After moving eastward into the town, the twister damaged 15\u00a0homes, several of them severely. A total of three people were injured. The next tornado was a waterspout that moved ashore over Treasure Island around 05:00\u00a0UTC. Rated F0, the tornado deroofed one home, damaged several others, and impacted a few boats.[27] Around 05:04\u00a0UTC, an F0 tornado was reported in New Port Richey, damaging several homes and injuring 11\u00a0people. About 16\u00a0minutes later, an F2 tornado formed to the southwest of Ocala. Many trees fell and several storage buildings and a warehouse suffered extensive damage, while one hangar was destroyed and two others received major damage at the Ocala International Airport. At 05:20\u00a0UTC, approximately the same time as the Ocala tornado, another twister \u2013 rated F1 \u2013 touched down near LaCrosse. Several trees and power lines were downed and a few homes were destroyed, one from a propane explosion. One person was killed and four others received injuries. About 10\u00a0minutes later, another F2 twister was spawned near Howey-in-the-Hills. It moved through Mount Dora, destroying 13\u00a0homes, substantially damaging 80\u00a0homes, and inflicting minor damage on 266\u00a0homes. One person, a 5-month-old baby, was killed, while two others were injured.[27] At 05:30\u00a0UTC, a waterspout-turned F0 tornado tossed a 23\u00a0ft (7.0\u00a0m) sailboat about 300\u00a0ft (91\u00a0m) at the Davis Islands yacht club in Tampa, while five other boats broke loose from their cradles and twelve were smashed into the seawall. About 30\u00a0minutes later,\nan F1 tornado formed in Jacksonville, demolishing four dwellings and damaging sixteen others.[27] Also at 06:00\u00a0UTC, an F0 tornado spawned near Bartow snapped a few trees and damaged a few doors. The eleventh and final tornado developed in Jacksonville at 06:10\u00a0UTC. The twister damaged a few trees near the Jacksonville International Airport. At the airport itself, the tornado damaged several jetways and service vehicles, while a Boeing 737 was pushed about 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m).[27] A substantial storm surge was also generated along the gulf coast from Apalachee Bay in the Florida Panhandle to north of Tampa Bay. Due to the angle of the coast relative to the approaching squall, Taylor County along the eastern portion of Apalachee Bay and Hernando County north of Tampa were especially hard-hit.[4] Storm surges in those areas reached up to 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m),[26] higher than many hurricanes. With little advance warning of incoming severe conditions, some coastal residents were awakened in the early morning of March 13 by the waters of the Gulf of Mexico rushing into their homes.[28] More people died from drowning in this storm than during Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew combined.[5] Overall, the storm's surge, winds, and tornadoes damaged or destroyed 18,000\u00a0homes.[29] A total of 47\u00a0people died in Florida due to this storm.[4] Despite all the rainfall and tornadoes, lots of snow also dropped in the Panhandle regions of Florida. Areas saw snow of up to 1 foot near the coast and inland. In Tallahassee, around 1 to 2 inches of snow were dropped to the ground. In Jacksonville and Fernandina beach, traces of snow were seen in the air. Very cold temperatures were also seen in the state. Snow was seen as far south as Tampa Bay in central Florida. Tallahassee's lowest temperature was 17 degrees F (-8 degrees C) On March 13, Orlando saw 26 degrees F (-3 degrees C), and Miami saw 39 degrees F (4 degrees C ) That same day. In Orlando, there were mixed precipitations with rain, sleet and snow combined. Miami saw near record cold temperatures for the month of March, making it a very rare phenomenon for Florida. Florida is usually mild all year round so it was rare."

As of the 2020 United States census, the city's population was 76,831. Flagstaff is the principal city of the Flagstaff metropolitan area, which includes all of Coconino County, and has a population of 145,101. Flagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau and within the San Francisco volcanic field, along the western side of the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the continental United States. The city sits at about 7,000 feet (2,100\u00a0m) and is next to Mount Elden, just south of the San Francisco Peaks, the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona. Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona at 12,637 feet (3,852\u00a0m), is about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) north of Flagstaff in Kachina Peaks Wilderness. The geology of the area includes exposed rock from the Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras, with Moenkopi Formation red sandstone having once been quarried in the city; many of the historic downtown buildings were constructed with it. The Rio de Flag river runs through the city, but only flows in response to rain or snowmelt. Originally settled by the pre-Columbian native Sinagua people, the area of Flagstaff has fertile land from volcanic ash after eruptions in the 11th century. It was first settled as the present-day city in 1876. Local businessmen lobbied for Route 66 to pass through the city, which it did, turning the local industry from lumber to tourism and developing downtown Flagstaff. In 1930, Pluto was discovered from Flagstaff. The city developed further through to the end of the 1960s, with various observatories also used to choose Moon landing sites for the Apollo missions. Through the 1970s and 1980s, downtown fell into disrepair, but was revitalized with a major cultural heritage project in the 1990s. The city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare, and is home to the U.S. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station, the U.S. Geological Survey Astrogeology Science Center, and Northern Arizona University. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to Grand Canyon National Park, Oak Creek Canyon, the Arizona Snowbowl, Meteor Crater, and Historic Route 66."

        "content": "At the time of Beale's wagon road, the area was known as Antelope Spring, after the spring at the foot of Mars Hill (now called Antelope/Old Town Spring).[4][5][6][7] The name Flagstaff comes from an actual flagstaff made from a stripped pine tree that was erected at the spring, which McMillan was using as his sheep camp, on July 4, 1876.[8] The common story tells that the flag-raising for which the town was named occurred when a ponderosa pine flagpole made by a scouting party from Boston (known as the \"Second Boston Party\") was raised to celebrate the United States Centennial.[6][9][10] Various other stories have been told of the circumstances.[5] One says that on July 4, 1855, a surveyor for the railroad by the name of Samuel Clark Hudson, accompanied by his team, climbed a tall pine tree and tied a flag,[11] with another saying it was Beale's men who raised the flag in 1859.[4] The town was still known as Antelope Spring in 1871.[5][4][6] After the town took the name Flagstaff, it began to be known as 'Old Town'[a] for a period, and was known by different names when the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad was being built through the area in 1882.[5][6] It may have been known as Flagstaff Spring for a while, and 'Old Town Spring' after this before simply 'Old Town', a name given after a fire destroyed much of the town, with a new community then raised a few hundred yards away called 'New Town'.[4] Another version of the Old and New Town names says that the railroad depot was moved by half a mile to prevent hill starts, and business owners soon followed it, displacing the commerce of the town to Front Street of 'New Town' while the houses were still in 'Old Town' with the spring; when the fire burned down 'Old Town', 'New Town' remained.[12] The name Flagstaff was reinstated in 1884 when a post office was introduced alongside the railroad depot.[4][5][6] The city has different names in local Native languages. In Navajo, it is known as Kin\u0142\u00e1n\u00ed Dook\u02bco\u02bcoos\u0142\u00ed\u00edd Biyaagi. This name is formed from Kin\u0142\u00e1n\u00ed, meaning \"many houses\" or city, Dook\u02bco\u02bcoos\u0142\u00ed\u00edd, the name for the San Francisco Peaks but literally \"the summit which never melts\", and Biyaagi, indicating 'below' (see translations of \"below; in a place beneath\" on wiktionary): the city below the San Francisco Peaks. The word Kin\u0142\u00e1n\u00ed alone may refer to Flagstaff, but also can refer to Durango, Colorado.[13] In Havasupai, Flagstaff is known as Wii Hagnbaj. This is also a name for the San Francisco Peaks, and literally means \"snowy mountain\".[14]"

The San Francisco Peaks, which overlook Flagstaff, are a sacred site in Hopi culture.[4] Until western expansion in the 1860s, the Yavapai, specifically the Wi:pukba (Northeastern Yavapai), occupied the land up to the San Francisco Peaks.[22] The Yavapai land in the area saw overlap with the land of the Northern Tonto Apache that stretched across the San Francisco Peaks to the Little Colorado River.[23][24][25] Of the Northern Tonto Apache, two tribes lived within the area of present-day Flagstaff: the Oak Creek band and the Mormon Lake band.[26][27][28][29] The Mormon Lake band were centered around Flagstaff and were exclusively hunter-gatherers, traveling around places like the foot of the San Francisco Peaks, at Mount Elden, Lake Mary, Stoneman Lake, and Padre Canyon.[30]"

McMillan built a cabin just north of the present-day main town.[8] McMillan was a key developer of Northern Arizona.[8] During the 1880s, Flagstaff began to grow,[5] and by 1886, Flagstaff was the largest city on the railroad line between Albuquerque and the West Coast of the United States.[11] In 1888, McMillan purchased an unfinished building that sits at the present-day intersection of Leroux Street and Route 66/Santa Fe Avenue, turning it into a bank and hotel known as the Bank Hotel.[8] Coconino County was created in 1891, and Flagstaff was chosen as its county seat over nearby Williams.[5] In 1894, A. E. Douglass recommended Flagstaff to Percival Lowell as the site for the Lowell Observatory,[31] where it was built on Mars Hill.[32] Flagstaff also became incorporated as a town in 1894.[4] The city grew rapidly, primarily due to its location along the east\u2013west transcontinental railroad line in the United States.[33]:\u200a65\u201367\u200a In the 1890s, the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company was founded by the Riordan brothers to process timber. Michael and Tim Riordan worked in Flagstaff, and introduced electricity to the town for this purpose.[5] The Riordan brothers established the first library in Flagstaff.[34]  The CO Bar Ranch was opened in about 1886 by the Babbitt brothers for cattle.[35] The Babbitt family would be very influential in northern Arizona for decades.[35][36] In 1899, the Northern Arizona Normal School was established; it was renamed to Northern Arizona University (NAU) in 1966.[11] On January 1, 1900, John Weatherford opened the Weatherford Hotel in Flagstaff. Weatherford opened the town's first movie theater in 1911; it collapsed under heavy snowfall a few years later, but he soon replaced it with the Orpheum Theater. The Weatherford Hotel and Orpheum Theater are still in use today.[5]"

As part of the celebrations, Front Street was renamed Santa Fe Avenue.[40] The people of Flagstaff collectively funded the Hotel Monte Vista, which opened on January 1, 1927, preparing for the next tourism boom.[40][41] Flagstaff was then incorporated as a city in 1928,[11] with over 3,000 residents,[40] and in 1929, the city's first motel, the Motel Du Beau, was built at the intersection of Beaver Street and Phoenix Avenue.[33]:\u200a244\u2013245\u200a Flagstaff became a popular tourist stop along Route 66, particularly due to its proximity to the natural wonders.[40][42] In the last years of the 1920s, tourism took over from traditional industries.[40] During the Great Depression, Route 66 brought unemployed workers heading to California, known as \"auto nomads\" in Flagstaff, who became unpopular as they could not afford to buy gas or food, financially damaging the city by taxing its resources and not contributing to the economy.[40] Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by Clyde Tombaugh's 1930 discovery of Pluto from the Lowell Observatory.[43][41] However, the importance of Route 66 to cross-country travel, and thus to Arizona's interests on a national level, did mean that it received a large share of state funding through the Depression, with highway maintenance and unemployment acts providing over $1 million of funding in May 1933. In 1935, many residents had enough disposable income to remodel their homes or build new ones.[40] In 1955, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was established.[43] Through the 1950s the city conducted the Urban Renewal Project, improving housing quality in the Southside neighborhood that was largely populated by people of Spanish, Basque, and Mexican heritage.[44] Flagstaff grew and prospered through the 1960s.[41] During the Apollo program in the 1960s, the Lowell Observatory Clark Telescope was used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to map the Moon for the lunar expeditions, enabling the mission planners to choose a safe landing site for the lunar modules.[32][41][45]"

Several historic buildings from the 1800s were also destroyed for construction of new ones, or leveled completely.[46][47] Downtown Flagstaff became an uninviting place,[46] and many businesses started to move out of the area, causing an economic and social decline.[33]:\u200a161\u2013167\u200a[46] During the 1990s, the city redeveloped.

Flagstaff lies at approximately 7,000 feet (2,130\u00a0m) elevation, and is surrounded by the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in North America. It is in a mountainous area,[51][52] and lies along the Rio de Flag watercourse.[53] It is about 130 miles (210\u00a0km) north of the State capital, Phoenix.[54] The geology of the area is in line with that of the Colorado Plateau on which it lies,[55] with the Moenkopi red sandstone abundant in the city also used to build many of the distinctive buildings forming its cityscape. The cityscape of Flagstaff is its historic downtown area centered on Heritage Square, with the historic nature of its restored buildings and local theme iconic to the city and representative of its culture.[56][33] Flagstaff is one of the United States' sunniest and snowiest cities, with a variable \"semi-arid\" climate and a monsoon season in summer.[57] The San Francisco Peaks are a main aspect of Flagstaff's local geography and can be seen from everywhere in the city.

        "content": "Flagstaff lies on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, and is largely limestone under San Francisco volcanic field. The oldest rock types of the area are part of North America's original crust, Precambrian granite and schist from 1.7 to 1.8 billion years ago. On top of this is Paleozoic sandstone, limestone, shale and siltstone deposited on what was then (544 to 248 million years ago) different surfaces, including a shallow seabed, muddy land, and sandy desert. The rock layers from this period are (bottom to top): Tapeats Sandstone, Bright Angel Shale and Muav Limestone, Martin Formation, Redwall Limestone, Supai Group, Coconino Sandstone, Toroweap Formation, and Kaibab Limestone. The last three of these are still exposed. On top of the Paleozoic rock is Mesozoic Moenkopi Formation, from 248 to 65 million years ago. Other Mesozoic layers formed on top of this, but were eroded away. In the Flagstaff area, layers of rock from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras accumulated up to 10,000 feet (3,000\u00a0m) deep, but most of this was eroded.[55] A soft basalt layer covers some of the rock at the surface.[55][60] Moenkopi Formation red sandstone is a distinctive feature of Flagstaff, as it was used as a building material from the 1880s because of its fire retardant properties. The source used for quarrying most of this rock was a deposit 1 mile east of the town, which fell under the control of Charles Begg in 1887, who then began selling the stone across the southwest \u2013 after he made a successful sale in California that expanded the business, he was replaced in 1888 by a master quarryman. While it was used as building material across the West, some of Flagstaff's most prominent buildings are famous for the stone, including the Bank Hotel,[56] Weatherford Hotel, Babbitt Brothers Building, Coconino County Courthouse,[33] and various NAU buildings, including Old Main.[56] In the Laramide orogeny, which began about 65\u201375 million years ago, the Western United States underwent stress in rock formation; in the Four Corners region this pushed up the preexisting layers and ultimately formed the Colorado Plateau (and the Rocky Mountains). Around Flagstaff more specifically, this process deformed flat rock layers into folds, and allowed surface rivers to cut deep canyons in the younger rock layers. From about 25 million years ago, more faults were broken again in Flagstaff, and volcanic activity began about 6 million years ago with magma flowing up these faults to create lava flows. Eruptions occurred between 3 million and 1,000 years ago, affecting the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks. The city's Mount Elden is a lava dome made of dacite, Sunset Crater is the youngest feature of the San Francisco volcanic field and formed in the last 1,000 years by an explosive eruption, while S P Crater was formed between 75,000 and 70,000 years ago by piles of lapilli and volcanic bombs spouting from a lava lake.[55] In the 1960s, the geology and topography of the Flagstaff area, including formations like Meteor Crater, was seen as similar to environments that would be encountered on the Moon in terms of planetary geology. The Astrogeology Research Program was therefore moved to Flagstaff in 1962, with the program completing in 1963, to train astronauts.[61][62]"

The record low high is 5\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221215\u00a0\u00b0C) from January 1963, but the mean for the coldest maximum is relatively close to freezing at 24\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0C).[70] Like most of the state, Northern Arizona experiences a summer monsoon season from July to September,[71] with Flagstaff's wettest months being July and August, and its driest being June, all in the summer;[63] Mediterranean climates have wet season only in the winter.[72] Mediterranean climate categorization does not consider snowfall.[73]  Semi-arid climates will receive 10\u201320 inches (250\u2013510\u00a0mm) of annual rainfall,[74] while Flagstaff experiences more.[c] Flagstaff's hardiness zone is mostly 6a, with some areas 5b, meaning plants withstand temperatures down to \u221215\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221226\u00a0\u00b0C).[75] It is in the Transition life zone;[76] the concept of life zones was first observed in the Flagstaff area.[77] Wind in Flagstaff typically blows southwesterly throughout the year, based on topographical features.[57] The city's climate data is observed from Flagstaff Pulliam Airport.[78] The city receives precipitation every year, with two distinct wet periods in the summer and winter; the summer monsoon season accounts for 34% of annual rainfall, with the winter producing 28%. The summer monsoon season, originating from the Mexican monsoon period, is also wetter than winter, with an average 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) compared to the winter's 6 inches (150\u00a0mm). Before the summer monsoon each year there is a dry period in May and June. Long-term average precipitation is 21.6 inches (550\u00a0mm) annually, with much heavier rainfall attributed to El Ni\u00f1o events. Comparatively, La Ni\u00f1a events have caused below-average rainfall.[78] Since 1996 the city has been experiencing its driest period, known as the Early-21st Century Drought. As of 2007,[needs update?] Richard Hereford of USGS speculated that the effects of the drought, predicted to last until the late 2020s, may be severe because of Flagstaff's growing population and global warming. The summer wet season is more reliable and consistent than other times of year, but due to the high temperatures of the area this rainfall is quickly lost to evaporation. During the Early-21st Century Drought, rainfall has been consistently below average in all but the summer season, with temperature averages for all but the summer (which has remained consistent) also increasing.[78] Equally, snowfall has been lower during the extended dry period,[78] though the city set a new record for its highest daily snowfall on February 21, 2019, with 35.9 inches (91\u00a0cm)[79][80] and was still ranked as the United States' third-snowiest city in 2020 (based on 2018\u201319 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data). Flagstaff has consistently been among the snowiest cities in the United States,[81] and snow and winter culture is argued by Michael Weeks to be a large part of Flagstaff's identity.[68] The Arizona Snowbowl is a major attraction, though it has had to make artificial snow during warmer seasons, and the city tried to launch a bid to be the host city of the 1960 Winter Olympics.[68] The maximum daily snow cover was 83 inches (210\u00a0cm) on December 20, 1967, although the mean maximum for a full winter is only 20 inches (51\u00a0cm). However, due to the infrequent and scattered nature of the snowstorms, persistent snowpack into spring is rare.[11] One notable exception occurred during the severe winter of 1915\u201316, when successive Pacific storms buried the city under over 70 inches (178\u00a0cm) of snow, and some residents were snowbound in their homes for several days.[82] The earliest seasonal trace of snowfall occurred on September 19, 1965, and the latest on May 29 in both 1971 and 1990.[83] Though one of the least-sunny cities in Arizona,[84] Flagstaff still ranks among the United States' sunniest cities, having sunshine for an average 78% of the year.[57] The city receives much more sunshine than other snowy cities, which are primarily in the north of the country.[85]"

Sometimes, snow reappears in May, but the spring period is typically mild and dry, lasting until early June. The summer is warm, measured between days when freezing temperatures occur, beginning in June \u2013 the last freezing temperature generally in early June \u2013 and ending in September. Flagstaff's summer will receive a few days of daytime temperatures above 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C), with much cooler nighttime temperatures typically in the region of 40\u00a0\u00b0F (4\u00a0\u00b0C). Flagstaff's summers are also notable for the monsoon season in July and August, when thunderstorms occur almost daily. Thunderstorm activity happens mostly during the daytime.[57] Freezing temperatures (below 32\u00a0\u00b0F (0\u00a0\u00b0C)) return towards the end of September, with the mild fall season having daytime temperatures around 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C).[57] With its many trees, leaves do change color in Flagstaff's fall, with the change starting at the end of September and happening throughout October.[86] Fall lasts only until the snow comes in November, with winter marked between periods of snowfall, typically from November until mid-April at the latest. Temperatures in winter are usually below freezing, going no higher than around 45\u00a0\u00b0F (7\u00a0\u00b0C) in the day, even in sunshine.[citation needed] Nights can regularly plummet below 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C). A combination of snow cover and high pressure occurring during winter months will cause the temperature to drop further, once reaching a record low of \u221230\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221234\u00a0\u00b0C). Flagstaff's winter wet season is caused by Pacific storms and lasts from November through April.[57] See or edit raw graph data."

        "header": "Flora and fauna",
        "content": "Flagstaff is an area \"of great ecological variation\" due to its diverse habitat life zones.[92] Tree species abound the area, which covers three arboreal life zones: Douglas fir and aspen forest, Ponderosa pine forest, and Pinyon-juniper woodland.[92] It is at the heart of the Coconino National Forest. Within the Transition zone of the forest, including in the city, there are huge stands of ponderosa pine. Other species scattered among this region include Gambel oak, quaking aspen, and Rocky Mountain juniper trees.[93] The Coconino National Forest and Flagstaff are within the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in North America.[52] Here, this tree type is formed as a climax forest, with groups of trees containing different ages spread among the forest. Some of the groups are only a few trees, some are acres large; other groups are even-aged. The irregularity of the tree groups leaves natural openings in the forest, allowing for other plants to thrive. A grass cover of Arizona fescue grows around the area and shrub exists, but there are few other tree species. As well as the Gambel oak, quaking aspen, and juniper trees, pinyons can be found among the pines. Some of the open forest space contains bunchgrass, and local animal species that roam on this include elk, mule deer, Merriam's Turkey, and Abert's squirrel.[94] The arboretum in Flagstaff has an extensive regional collection of the Penstemon genus and hosts an annual Penstemon Festival.[95] Coconino is also home to a variety of bird species, which is further diversified by species from desert climates south of the Mogollon Rim still mixing in the area. The nearby lakes also attract wildlife. Birds that live around or visit Flagstaff include the thick-billed kingbird, only documented in the area since 2016, the red-faced warbler, a Madrean species, and waterfowl including the Eurasian wigeon and American wigeon.[96]"

Downtown Flagstaff is a \"narrow and slender\" area between the NAU campus at its south and the Museum of Northern Arizona at the north.[97] Flagstaff is a smaller city, so its downtown is largely local and independent.[98] The city's mall is found in East Flagstaff, as is a Harkins movie theater and a country club and golf course. Residential properties in East Flagstaff are larger and more rural than other parts of the city. North West Flagstaff is directly north of downtown, and is where the Snowbowl and Museum of Northern Arizona are found. West Flagstaff encompasses the area south and west of downtown, including NAU and the Lake Mary neighborhood. It also covers the airport and Fort Tuthill (county park and the Pepsi Amphitheater), being bordered to the south by the urban areas of Kachina Village and Mountainaire. Outside of the city proper, these urban areas have a \"mountain-town feel\".[99] Flagstaff has an \"urban forest park\", Buffalo Park,[100] which sits on top of McMillan Mesa and used to be home to a zoo in the 1960s.[101][102] Buffalo Park/McMillan Mesa bisects the city, separating East Flagstaff from West Flagstaff and downtown.[54]"

The racial makeup of the city was 73.4% White, 1.9% Black or African American, 11.7% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 7.3% from other races, and 3.6% from two or more races; 18.4% of the population were Hispanics or Latinos of any race. The city's African American population is considerably lower than the U.S. average (1.9% versus 12.6%), while the Native American population is markedly higher (11.7% vs. 0.9%). This is primarily attributable to the city's proximity to several Native American reservations. Flagstaff's Native American community is chiefly Navajo, and there are about 5,500 people of Navajo ancestry living in the city.[105] A 1970 study found that while the Native American population of Flagstaff was generally under-counted in censuses, the Native residents found that Flagstaff as a border city with reservations was much more welcoming than similar towns, particularly noting Gallup, New Mexico, as one that was worse. The study also documented that while there was a distinctly Native neighborhood in the poorer Southside area of Flagstaff, the housing quality varied greatly, with middle class Native residencies elsewhere in the city.[106] Though Flagstaff has a low African American population, it had seen large immigration of black people from the Southern United States in the middle of the 20th century during the Great Migration. Though most moved to California, there was a significant number that settled in Flagstaff after hearing that the lumber industry of northern Arizona was some of the best paid work going, and a familiar vocation for those from southern states.[107]"

        "header": "Crime",
        "content": "Flagstaff has two police departments: Flagstaff PD and NAU PD.[108][109] NAU PD employs 30 officers and 25 students, and is responsible for law enforcement on the campus. Flagstaff PD will share information of concern about the neighborhoods surrounding the NAU campus to the NAU PD, and NAU PD may also respond to situations off-campus that involve students; NAU PD also investigates the missing person reports of students who are registered as resident on campus. From campus phones, all 911 calls will go to NAU PD.[110] The rate of crime in Flagstaff is above average, while its violent crime rate is below average, for the United States. For 2017, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report indicated for Flagstaff a rate of 290 cases of violent crime per 100,000 people and 2,710 cases of property crime per 100,000 population;[111] the violent crime rate across the US was 382.9 per 100,000.[112] In 2018, Flagstaff had a rate of 469.4 cases of all crimes per 100,000 people, up 10.7% on the total in 2017; this was below the average for Arizona, but above the average for the US. Until 2017, Flagstaff's crime rate was typically in line with the US average.[113] The safest neighborhood in Flagstaff is Elden Pueblo, with several downtown areas, NAU and the surrounding neighborhoods, Fort Valley, and Cosnino all in the top ten.[114] In 2017, Flagstaff PD responded to four hostage situations, including in Tuba City, and fifteen explosive device removal calls. There were 3,262 criminal investigations.[115] The Flagstaff narcotics task force headed up 'Operation Nightfall' between 2015 and 2017, aiming to prevent the use of I-40 through the city being used by Mexican drug cartels for trafficking, successfully seizing over 138\u00a0kg (304\u00a0lb) of cocaine. Within Flagstaff, there were over 100 arrests relating to other narcotics crimes.[115] NAU operates as a weapon-free and drug-free campus (even medical marijuana), with restrictions on alcohol possession for resident students over 21 within certain private areas of certain residence halls.[110] In 2016, it became a tobacco-free campus.[116] Additionally, alcohol may not be consumed in public on the campus. The overwhelming majority of NAU PD recorded crimes are related to drugs and alcohol, with hundreds of arrests each year and over 1500 disciplinary referrals in 2018. The second-most recorded area of crime on the campus is gender based violence (rape, domestic abuse), with a few dozen cases. There are over 160 blue light phones on the campus; each has a large button that connects directly to NAU PD and provides the location of the call to them.[110] The police in Flagstaff also deal with skunk-related problems, including suspected burglaries that turn out to be skunks.[117] The skunks can be an issue in the city, as they start rabies epidemics among animals every few years.[118]"

Today, that has largely been replaced by tourism, education, government, and transportation. Some of the larger employers in Flagstaff are Northern Arizona University, the Flagstaff Medical Center, and the Flagstaff Unified School District. Tourism is a large contributor to the economy, as the city receives over 5 million visitors per year.[11] Scientific and high tech research and development operations are in the city, including Lowell Observatory, Northern Arizona University, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) and the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Flagstaff campus. Research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets.[119] In 2012 the observatory commissioned its Lowell Discovery Telescope, a 4.3-meter telescope with an instrument cube that can hold five instruments at once.[120] Lowell Observatory and NOFS also are collaborators on the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and astrometry, or the positions and distances of stars and celestial objects.[119] There are five industrial parks in the city, situated near I-40 and I-17. Major manufacturers in Flagstaff include W. L. Gore & Associates, widely known as the maker of Gore-Tex; Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare, manufacturer of pet food; SenesTech, a biotechnology research lab and manufacturer; SCA Tissue, a major tissue paper producer; and Joy Cone, manufacturer of ice cream cones.[121][122] Walgreens operated a distribution center in the city until 2014.[11][123][124]"

        "header": "Tourism",
        "content": "Flagstaff has a thriving tourism industry, and has since the early 1900s, primarily stemming from its proximity to the Grand Canyon National Park and other natural wonders, giving it the nickname 'City of Seven Wonders'.[5] Other natural wonders and native ruins, Route 66, and its astronomical history also bring tourism from out of state, while people from further south in Arizona visit Flagstaff because of its cooler climate in the summer and its ski resort in the winter.[39] The city has several hotels and restaurants, including its historic hotels. The first hotel of the Ramada Inn chain opened in 1954 at the intersection of Routes 66, 89, and 89A, adjacent to what was then Arizona State College (now NAU). The original building is still intact, operating as a Super 8 motel.[125] Flagstaff is said to attract a lot of the tourism for the entire county as it is the only large population center that can cater to tourists, as well as being the location of information points for the National Park Service (NPS). In 1996, 39% of Coconino County residents were employed in tourism. There are large service sectors, particularly hotels and restaurants, in Flagstaff, with many of these companies having a close connection to NAU's School of Hotel and Restaurant Management, to employ these students.[39] Tourism to Flagstaff is a well-established industry, but still relies on environmental forces. Nature and weather conditions can damage tourism; having a mild but warm summer temperature attracts tourists from many locales, but storms and forest fires in its climate can be a detraction. Flagstaff also experiences very cold winters, and despite a successful ski resort still sees less tourism in this period; decreasing snow levels also threaten the winter industry. The pristine condition of the natural sites can also experience degradation due to overuse through tourism, losing its main selling point. The development of Tusayan into the Grand Canyon gateway town also affected Flagstaff's capture of some overnight tourists.[39] The Grand Canyon, a Wonder of the World, is about 80 miles (130\u00a0km) northwest of Flagstaff.[39] The first stagecoach tours to the Grand Canyon from the city began running from the Bank Hotel in 1892.[8] In 2000, about 5 million people visiting the Grand Canyon also visited Flagstaff. As Rick Heffernon wrote, \"the world recognizes only one Grand Canyon, and northern Arizona has it\".[39] However, he also suggested this can act to the area's detriment, as the Grand Canyon is a world-class marvel and competes with other attractions of the same prestige for visitors, which are all equally impressive; Flagstaff itself also competes with its nearby towns for access to the Grand Canyon, several of which have growing themes based on it (like Tusayan and the Grand Canyon Village).[39] Lowell Observatory celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2019 and continues to be a leading astronomical research center, as well as a popular destination for visitors. More than 100,000 people visited in both 2018 and 2019; in 2019 the observatory opened its new Giovale Open Deck Observatory, an observation plaza with a suite of six advanced telescopes.[126][127] Arizona Snowbowl does not publish their revenue or make it public knowledge, which makes it hard to calculate its impact on the Flagstaff economy.[128] The Snowbowl supports approximately 200 full-time jobs and $12.08 million in economic output for the city of Flagstaff.[129] Heffernon suggested that the perception of tourism from the residents of Flagstaff could affect the industry,[39] something researched in 1990 by NAU's Tim Schroeder. Schroeder saw six main areas of concern from Flagstaff residents: \"Standard of Living for Residents; Future Use of Parks; Quality of Fire Protection; Occurrences of Crime; Changes in Community Values, Norms and Customs; and Population Density\".[130] He acknowledged that the focus on fire protection was anomalous, and likely caused by a particularly high concern surrounding recent wildfires at the time the survey had been conducted. The respondents to Schroeder's survey generally found that their \"Opportunity for Jobs, Opportunity for Shopping, Quality of Fire Protection, Understanding Different People, Quality of Health Care, Availability of Cultural Arts, and Overall Quality of Life\" had improved because of tourism to the area, but that standards in terms of \"Traffic and Road Conditions, General Prices for Goods and Services, Future Use of Forests, Noise, Litter, Air Quality, and Occurrences of Crime\" had worsened.[130]"

The tradition originated in 1999, when Henry Taylor and Sam Green (owners of the hotel), decorated a garbage can with paint, lights, and pine cones, and dropped it from the roof of their building to mark the new millennium. By 2003 the event had become tradition, and the current metallic pine cone was designed and built by Frank Mayorga of Mayorga Welding in the city.[131] Local museums include the Museum of Northern Arizona, which features displays of the biology, archeology, photography, anthropology, and native art of the Colorado Plateau, and the Arboretum at Flagstaff, a 200-acre (81\u00a0ha) arboretum containing 2,500 species of drought-tolerant native plants representative of the high desert region.[132][133] A lot of the local culture is also focused on Route 66, which originally ran between Chicago and Los Angeles, greatly increased the accessibility to the area, and enhanced the culture and tourism in Flagstaff.[134] Route 66 remains a historic route, passing through the city between Barstow, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.

This was the world's first coordinated legislative effort to do so. In the city there have now been over sixty years of planning and development of effective strategies to limit light pollution,[136] with the support of the environmentally aware population and community advocates, government and elected officials, and the assistance of observatories in the area \u2013 including the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station and Lowell Observatory.[137][138][139][140] The city's designation as the first International Dark Sky City was on October 24, 2001, by the International Dark-Sky Association, after a proposal by the Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition to start the recognition program. It is seen as a world precedent in dark sky preservation.[141] Before this, it had been nicknamed the \"Skylight City\" in the 1890s, the same decade that the Lowell Observatory was founded.[142] In 1958, it passed Ordinance 400,[136] which outlawed using searchlights within city limits. In the 1980s a series of measures were introduced for the city and Coconino County, and the Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition was founded in 1999 by Lance Diskan and John Grahame. Diskan had originally moved to Flagstaff from Los Angeles so that his children could grow up able to see stars, saying that \"part of being human is looking up at the stars and being awestruck.\"[142] Measurements taken in 2017 show that Flagstaff's sky glow is only 8% of the sky glow over another Western city of comparable size, Cheyenne, Wyoming."

At Glendale, they train in a domed stadium rather than outside,[f] which player Bertrand Berry said took away some of the feeling of training camp, saying \"there really isn't that need to practice outside when most of the games are inside, but when you talk about building a team and going through adverse situations and bonding together, I think they miss out on a little bit of that\".[178] The Cardinals had trained at NAU since the franchise moved to Arizona, with Fox Sports reporting that \"some argued they pulled the plug on the team's only Arizona tradition\".[174] Bill Bidwill, owner of the Cardinals, was inducted into the Flagstaff Sports Foundation's Hall of Fame in 2009, after bringing the team and resultant tourism boost to the city for over 20 years.[173]"

The first elite athletes to start altitude training in the city were those going to the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.[180] A 2009 analysis showed that groups of 35 athletes spent three to eight weeks training in Flagstaff, to positive effect. This was one of the highest number of athletes and longest periods among seventeen sites used in the research.[181] Australian rules football team Collingwood Magpies regularly train at NAU facilities,[182] as does the Olympic-medal-winning Team GB British Swimming team.[183] Another British Olympian, Mo Farah, trains in Flagstaff.[184] Long-distance runner Andrea Seccafien used to altitude train in Flagstaff but moved to Australia in 2018,[185][186] saying \"We don't go to Flagstaff or St. Moritz anymore which are more populated by runners and the general public. [...] Flagstaff feels quite metropolitan compared to where we are now\"; the Canadian Running Magazine noted that the city becomes host to many professional runners in the spring.[186] The popularity among runners is because of the altitude and pleasant climate, making it \"for distance runners [...] a practically unparalleled paradise\", known as the \"running mecca\".[187] Runner Nick Hilton said that \"Flagstaff and Boulder, Colorado, are probably the two biggest centers for elite distance runners in the country\".[187] The HYPO2 altitude training center in the city is used by swimmers and runners alike, and is an elite facility that attracts many teams from around the world.[183][187][188] HYPO2 was created in 2012, largely with staff from NAU's Center for High Altitude Training, which closed in 2009. As of 2019, over 85 Olympic medalists from 44 countries trained at the facility.[187] In 2016, the city advertised NAU and the HYPO2 with promotions saying \"The Road to Rio Runs Through Flagstaff\", prominently noting that if Flagstaff (with its training athletes) was a country, it would be in the top 10 of Olympic-medal winning nations since 1996.[180]"

North Fork is part of the Madera Metropolitan Statistical Area and is home to the tribal headquarters of the Northfork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California. North Fork is situated in the Sierra Nevada foothills at an elevation of 2,638 feet. It is roughly 46 miles (74\u00a0km) miles north-northeast of Fresno, 41 miles (66\u00a0km) miles northeast of Madera, and 17 miles (27\u00a0km) miles southeast of Oakhurst by road. The CDP has a total area of 32.3 square miles (84\u00a0km2) square miles, with Willow Creek, North Fork, and South Fork serving as its primary bodies of water. North Fork also holds the distinction of being the community closest to the geographic center of California. North Fork is within the ancestral home of the Mono Native Americans. The community developed into a significant hub for the timber industry, which was the mainstay of the local economy until the late 20th century. Attractions in North Fork include the Sierra Mono Museum and the Sierra Vista Scenic Byway. The Buckhorn Saloon, a mainstay since the 1800s, continues to function as a restaurant and tavern. North Fork is also the site of the annual Mid-Sierra Loggers Jamboree, a tribute to the region's logging history."

Consequently, the location was often referred to as \"Brown's Place.\"[28]:\u200a115\u2013117 A significant shift in the settlement's trajectory occurred in 1886 with the establishment of a sawmill on Peckinpah Mountain by Milton Brown and his partner, John Bartram. This venture marked the foundation of the North Fork Lumber Company, which would play a pivotal role in the community's evolution. By 1887, the company had established a post office under the name North Fork, subsequently bestowing the settlement with its present-day name.[29] The small settlement, comprising mainly a handful of stores, hotels, and a watering trough, was primarily inhabited by miners and hog stockmen. Contemporary accounts note that the main store offered \"a few groceries, cheap calico, and lots of whiskey,\" a selection that influenced locals to rename Alder Creek to Whiskey Creek, reflecting the area's reputation.[30] The Fresno Morning Republican once described the area as \"a bleak little mountain center,\" emphasizing its isolation from valley towns such as Friant and Madera.[31] Sam Peckinpah, the renowned director, drew inspiration from his youth spent on his grandparents' ranch in North Fork. His grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles M. Peckinpah, settled in North Fork in 1884, and the name \"Peckinpah Mountain\" pays homage to their former sawmill site.[32] Peckinpah, born in 1925, channeled his family's experiences during the Wild West period into his Western films and TV series, including Ride the High Country (1962) and The Wild Bunch (1969). The town of North Fork in The Rifleman TV series, which Peckinpah created, is named after the real-life North Fork.[33]"

The Sugar Pine Lumber Company, operating in the mountains above North Fork, shut down in 1933.[34] In 1941, the Associated Box and Lumber Company purchased 135 acres (55\u00a0ha) of land and moved its operations from Bieber to North Fork by 1942. This relocation marked a significant change for the town, starting a new logging era that lasted over fifty years. The introduction of logging trucks and modern equipment allowed deeper access into the Sierra National Forest, increasing the industry's reach and efficiency. Although the sawmill and logging roads were not fully developed, operations began in 1942. By April 1, 1943, the mill processed its first log into lumber. In its first year, the North Fork mill processed over nine million board feet of lumber, mainly from ponderosa pine, sugar pine, lodgepole pine, and incense cedar in the Sierra National Forest. The establishment of the mill significantly transformed North Fork. By 1951, the population surged to over 2,000 people.[35] The mill emerged as a major employer, offering jobs to over 130 workers at peak times and contributing about $500,000 to the local economy annually.[36] Despite this economic boost, North Fork did not have a bank.[37] The mill complex featured a sawmill, planing mill, lumber storage, workshops, and housing for employees.[38] These accommodations included twenty-two two-bedroom houses available for rent. By 1968, the mill's annual payroll increased to $1,250,000, highlighting the logging industry's importance to the area. In 1985, Ron Yanke acquired the mill, renaming it South Fork Timber Industries. From 1985 to 1991, the mill averaged an annual output of 143 million board feet of lumber, sufficient to build around 12,000 single-family homes.[39][40] A cogeneration plant was added in 1986, utilizing sawdust to power boilers and generate electricity, with surplus electricity sold to utilities. The mill also began converting bark into humus and selling ash as fertilizer.[39] However, new government regulations by 1992 reduced forest yields significantly, dropping to 63.8 million board feet by 1993. These changes, along with rising costs, made lumber production unprofitable, leading to layoffs starting in 1991 and the mill's closure on February 25, 1994.[39]"

However, the overall employment rate in North Fork stands at 34.3%, significantly lower than the state's 60.0%.[27] The US Forest Service Crane Valley Hotshots, a crew of wildland firefighters, remain based in North Fork.[42]"

It catered to fishing and hunting parties during their respective seasons, as well as local loggers.[45] Known for its rough-and-tumble patrons, its proprietor was jailed for six months in the 1950s for firing a .45 caliber pistol at a patron.[46][47] Today, it continues to operate as a restaurant and western saloon. A historical marker, established by E Clampus Vitus, signifies the location of the stagecoach stop in the downtown area.[48] The geographical center of the state of California resides between North Fork and Italian Bar. The exact center, marked by a sign and a survey marker, is approximately 7.1 miles (11.4\u00a0km) driving distance from the United States Forest Service office in North Fork.[49] Initiated in 1959, the North Fork Loggers Jamboree began as a regional lumberjack competition open to loggers from seven local counties held annually on the first weekend in July.[50] The event included a loggersports competition, a main street parade, and a beauty pageant.[51] With the closure of the local mill in the 1990s, the event, now known as the Mid-Sierra Loggers Jamboree, has evolved into a tribute to the enduring legacy of logging in the region.[52]"

        "content": " The Sand Creek massacre (also known as the Chivington massacre, the battle of Sand Creek or the massacre of Cheyenne Indians) was a massacre of Cheyenne and Arapaho people by the U.S. Army in the American Indian Wars that occurred on November 29, 1864, when a 675-man force of the Third Colorado Cavalry[5] under the command of U.S. Volunteers Colonel John Chivington attacked and destroyed a village of Cheyenne and Arapaho people in southeastern Colorado Territory,[6] killing and mutilating an estimated 70 to over 600 Native American people. Chivington claimed 500 to 600 warriors were killed. However, most sources estimate around 150 people were killed, about two-thirds of whom were women and children.[4][2][7][3] The location has been designated the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site and is administered by the National Park Service. The massacre is considered part of a series of events known as the Colorado Wars."

        "content": "By the terms of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States and seven Indian nations, including the Cheyenne and Arapaho,[8] the United States recognized that the Cheyenne and Arapaho held a vast territory encompassing the lands between the North Platte River and the Arkansas River, and eastward from the Rocky Mountains to western Kansas. This area included present-day southeastern Wyoming, southwestern Nebraska, most of eastern Colorado, and the westernmost portions of Kansas.[9] In November 1858, however, the discovery of gold in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado,[10] then part of the Kansas Territory,[11] brought on the Pikes Peak Gold Rush. Immigrants flooded across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands. They competed for resources, and some settlers tried to stay.[10] Colorado territorial officials pressured federal authorities to redefine the extent of Indian lands in the territory,[9] and in the fall of 1860, A.B. Greenwood, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, arrived at Bent's New Fort, along the Arkansas River, to negotiate a new treaty.[10]"

        "content": "On February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States,[12] in which they ceded most of the lands designated to them by the Fort Laramie treaty.[9] The Cheyenne chiefs included Black Kettle, White Antelope (V\u00f3'kaa'e Ohv\u00f3'komaestse),[13] Lean Bear, Little Wolf, and Tall Bear; the Arapaho chiefs included Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, Big Mouth, and Niwot, or Left Hand.[12] The Cheyenne warriors denounced the chiefs who signed the treaty and even threatened them with death if they attempted to carry out the treaty's provisions.[14] The new reserve, less than 1/13th the size of the territory recognized in the 1851 treaty,[9] was located in eastern Colorado,[11] between the Arkansas River and Sand Creek.[9] Most bands of the Cheyenne, including the Dog Soldiers, a militaristic band of Cheyenne and Lakota that had originated in the late 1830s, were angry at the chiefs who had signed the treaty. They disavowed the treaty\u2014which never received the blessing of the Council of 44, the supreme tribal authority\u2014and refused to abide by its constraints.[16] They continued to live and hunt in the bison-rich lands of eastern Colorado and western Kansas, and became increasingly belligerent over the tide of white migration across their lands. Tensions were high, particularly in the Smoky Hill River country of Kansas, along which whites had opened a new trail to the gold fields.[17] Cheyenne who opposed the treaty said it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts. Officials took the position that Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war.[18] The Cheyenne started committing minor offenses in 1861. These offenses went unpunished and, subsequently, became more significant. The desire for war was so strong with the Cheyenne that Agent Lorey urged Governor John Evans to treat the Cheyenne anew in 1863. As agreed, Governor Evans went out to meet with the chiefs, but they did not show up to the appointed place. The governor sent his guide, Elbridge Gerry, out to try to find the chiefs. Gerry returned two weeks later saying that a council had been held wherein the chiefs decided not to meet with Governor Evans. Bull Bear offered to meet with the governor, but his warriors would not allow it.[14]"

        "header": "Escalation of hostilities",
        "content": "At the end of 1863 and in the beginning of 1864, word was received that a coalition was to be formed among the plains tribes to \"drive the whites out of the country.\"[14] In the spring and summer of 1864, the Sioux, Comanches, Kiowas, Cheyennes, and Arapahos were engaged in active hostilities which led to the murder of numerous civilians, the destruction of livestock and crops, supplies to the region being cut off, and the Colorado settlers in danger of starvation or murder at the hands of the plains tribes.[14] On April 12, men of the 1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment attacked Cheyenne men near Fr\u00e9mont's Orchard without any first attempt at parley or peace.[19] On April 13, a herdsman working for Irving, Jackmann & Company reported that Cheyennes and Arapahos had driven off 60 oxen and 12 horses and mules from their camp south of Denver. George Bent (a half-Cheyenne, half-white man who survived the ensuing Sand Creek Massacre along with other members of his family and tribe) disputes this version of the story. According to Bent, \"One day in April some Cheyennes from one of these camps were out hunting and found a number of oxen straying about among the sand hills. As they did not know to whom the animals belonged they drove them to camp, intending to keep them until someone could lay claim to them.... The Indians had no use for the oxen; there were plenty of buffalo on that range that winter, and the Indians never would eat \"tame meat\" when they could get buffalo.\"[20] A small contingent of soldiers, led by Lieutenant Clark Dunn, was sent to repossess the livestock. The ensuing confrontation resulted in the death of four of the soldiers, and the tribes maintained possession of the stolen livestock.[14] Lieutenant George Eayre was also sent to find and demand return of the oxen. If the animals' return was refused, Eayre was to attack the camp. Without following the order to first parley, Eayre and his men burned and plundered Crow Chief's band's camp of seventy lodges, which they abandoned once they were alerted to Eayre's force's approach. Eayre's men then found, plundered, and burned Chief Coon's band's camp (which Coon's band had likewise fled after being alerted of Eayre's approach by their scouts).[21] On May 16, less than 15 months after meeting President Lincoln in Washington,[22] Lean Bear, Black Kettle, and others in the tribe were camping on their buffalo hunting grounds near Ash Creek. The 1st Colorado Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant George Eayre, approached the group. Positive that this would be a peaceful encounter, Lean Bear went alone to meet the militia to show his peaceful intentions. On his chest, Lean Bear proudly wore his peace medal that he had received on his trip to Washington D.C. in 1863. In his hand, he held an official document signed by Lincoln stating that he was peaceful and friendly with whites.[23] What Lean Bear did not realize was that Eayre's troops were operating under orders from Colonel John M. Chivington to \"kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found.\"[24] Eayre ordered his men to shoot Lean Bear, who was wounded and fell off his horse. He was then shot repeatedly by the soldiers as they rode past his body on the ground.[23] Newspaper reports and books from the era report that Cheyenne warriors attacked settlers and committed a number of atrocities in the summer of 1864[25][14] including the June 11 Hungate massacre.[26] The beginning of the American Civil War in 1861 led to the organization of military forces in Colorado Territory. However, the attention of the federal government was firmly fixed on defeating the Confederates. As a result, there was no significant military protection of wagon trains, settlers, settlements, communication lines, and supply wagons in the region. By the summer of 1864, nearly every stage was being attacked, emigrants were being cut off, and settlements were being raided continually.[14] The settlers abandoned their farms and ranches and began seeking refuge in the major settlements such as Denver. A coordinated attack was carried out on August 8, 1864, where all the existing stage lines in the region were attacked.[14] Between August 11 and September 7, Governor Evans sent multiple letters to Secretary of War Edward Stanton in an attempt to furnish military aid, but Stanton was unable to pull the Second Colorado Volunteers, led by Colonel Ford, off of the eastern Civil War front.[14] As a result of the repeated calls for aid, authorization was granted to call up \"one-hundred-days' men\" to form the Third Colorado Volunteers. In 1864, before the events of the Massacre of Sand Creek, there were 32 Indian attacks on record. These resulted in the death of 96 settlers, 21 being wounded, and eight being captured. Between 250 and 300 head of livestock were stolen, 12 wagon trains and stagecoaches were attacked, robbed, or destroyed, and nine ranches and settlements were raided.[27] An exact number is unknown. It is likely higher. George Bent, a Dog Soldier in Black Kettle\u2019s camp, wrote about going on wagon train raids. \u201cCheyennes made good many raids towards Denver\u201d (Bent to Hyde 5-3-1905). George Bent, a half-Cheyenne, who was a Dog Soldier(Warrior) in Black Kettle\u2019s camp at Sand Creek, wrote letters to historians about the Cheyenne way of life and his experience at Sand Creek. He called Sand Creek a battle. \u201c I went to different lodges to shake hands with Black Kettle, Little Robe, Bear Tongue, Red Moon and lot of my friends that I was with at battle of Sand Creek that were going back with Black Kettle (George Bent to George Hyde, 1/12/1906). I am not a big war chief, but all the soldiers in this country are at my command. My rule of fighting white men or Indians is to fight them until they lay down their arms and submit to military authority. They are nearer to Major Wynkoop than any one else, and they can go to him when they get ready to do that."

McKenny, Assistant Adjutant-General of the Department of Kansas warned his superior, General Samuel Ryan Curtis that a few more reckless murders of Indians by the Volunteers risked uniting the various tribes into a general war against the US Army: I think if great caution is not exercised on our part there will be a bloody war. It should be our policy to try and conciliate them, guard our mails and trains well to prevent theft, and stop these scouting parties that are roaming over the country who do not know one tribe from another, and who will kill anything in the shape of an Indian. It will require but few murders on the part of our troops to unite all these warlike tribes of the plains, who have been at peace for years and intermarried amongst one another. I do wish that some prudent, good man could be placed in command of the troops along the roads from Smoky Fork, on the Leavenworth road, to Walnut Creek, and from Cow Creek thorough to Fort Lyon, on the Kansas City or old Santa Fe road."

        "header": "Governor Evans promises war",
        "content": "As the conflict between the Indians and settlers and soldiers in Colorado continued, the tribes would make war during the spring and summer months until subsistence became difficult to obtain. The tribes would then earnestly seek to make peace during the winter months, when they would stock up on supplies, arms, and munitions, until fairer weather would return and the war could be commenced anew. In July 1864, Colorado Governor John Evans sent a circular to the Plains Indians, inviting those who were friendly to go to a place of safety at Fort Lyon on the eastern plains, where their people would be given provisions and protection by the United States troops.[29] The circular itself was dated June 27, 1864. It was not until three months later, September 28, that the Cheyenne came to Denver to have peace talks with Governor Evans.[14] At this conference, the chiefs were told by Governor Evans that peace was not possible at that point and that \"whatever peace they make must be with the soldiers, and not with me.\"[14] At this council, White Antelope said that he feared the soldiers might kill some of his people while he was there. Governor Evans told him that there was great danger of it, and then he told White Antelope that one of the military chiefs (Colonel Chivington) was present and could tell the tribes what was necessary to secure peace. Governor Evans made clear that the purpose of the circular was not to extend peace, but rather it was an attempt to bring in the Indians who were friendly and were exposed to repudiation by the other tribes as a result.[30] The messages given by the white negotiators at the September 28th meeting were highly contradictory. On the one hand, Governor Evans told the chiefs, \"The time when you can make war best is in the summer; when I can make war best is in the winter. You, so far, have had the advantage. My time is just coming.\"[14] On the other hand, Colonel Chivington told the assembled Chiefs that if they sought peace, they should come to Fort Lyon and be under the protection of Major Wynkoop. 652 Arapahos led by Chief Little Raven appeared at Fort Lyon beginning around November 6, 1864, and were subsisted there by Major Anthony who had replaced Wynkoop. Later, when 600 Cheyenne appeared at the fort in a similar manner they were turned away and denied subsistence by Major Anthony.[14]"

Most tribal warriors stood their ground, refusing to leave their home under the guise of a threat, leaving only about 75 men, plus all the women and children in the village. The men who remained were mostly too old or too young to hunt. Black Kettle flew a U.S. flag, with a white flag tied beneath it,[32] over his lodge, as the Fort Lyon commander had advised him. This was to show he was friendly and forestall any attack by the Colorado soldiers.[33] Peace chief Ochinee, who tried to broker peace for the Cheyenne, was among those who were killed. Ochinee and 160 other people, most of whom were children and women, were killed.[34] Grandfather Ochinee (One-Eye) escaped from the camp, but seeing all that his people were to be slaughtered, he deliberately chose to go back into the one-sided battle and die with them."

        "header": "Chivington attacks the camp",
        "content": "Meanwhile, Chivington and 425 men of the 3rd Colorado Cavalry rode to Fort Lyon arriving on November 28, 1864. Once at the fort, Chivington took command of 250 men of the 1st Colorado Cavalry and maybe as many as 12 men of the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Infantry, then set out for Black Kettle's encampment. James Beckwourth, a noted frontiersman who had lived with the Indians for half a century, acted as guide for Chivington.[36][37] Prior to the massacre, several of Anthony's officers were not eager to join in the attack. Captain Silas Soule, Lieutenant Joseph Cramer and Lieutenant James Connor protested that attacking a peaceful camp would violate the pledge of safety provided to the Indians and would dishonor the uniform of the Army.[37] The following morning, Chivington gave the order to attack. Two officers, Captain Silas Soule and Lieutenant Joseph Cramer, commanding Company D and Company K of the First Colorado Cavalry, refused to obey and told their men to hold fire.[38] However, the rest of Chivington's men immediately attacked the village. Ignoring the U.S. flag and a white flag that was run up shortly after the attack began, they murdered as many of the Indians as they could. I saw the bodies of those lying there cut all to pieces, worse mutilated than any I ever saw before; the women cut all to pieces ... With knives; scalped; their brains knocked out; children two or three months old; all ages lying there, from sucking infants up to warriors ... By whom were they mutilated? By the United States troops ... I saw one squaw lying on the bank, whose leg had been broken. A soldier came up to her with a drawn sabre. She raised her arm to protect herself; he struck, breaking her arm. She rolled over, and raised her other arm; he struck, breaking that, and then left her with out killing her. I saw one squaw cut open, with an unborn child lying by her side. There was one little child, probably three years old, just big enough to walk through the sand. The Indians had gone ahead, and this little child was behind, following after them. The little fellow was perfectly naked, travelling in the sand. I saw one man get off his horse at a distance of about seventy-five yards and draw up his rifle and fire. He missed the child. Another man came up and said, 'let me try the son of a b-. I can hit him.' He got down off his horse, kneeled down, and fired at the little child, but he missed him. A third man came up, and made a similar remark, and fired, and the little fellow dropped. Fingers and ears were cut off the bodies for the jewelry they carried. The body of White Antelope, lying solitarily in the creek bed, was a prime target. Besides scalping him the soldiers cut off his nose, ears, and testicles-the last for a tobacco pouch ... Jis' to think of that dog Chivington and his dirty hounds, up thar at Sand Creek. His men shot down squaws, and blew the brains out of little innocent children. You call sich soldiers Christians, do ye? And Indians savages? What der yer s'pose our Heavenly Father, who made both them and us, thinks of these things? I tell you what, I don't like a hostile red skin any more than you do. And when they are hostile, I've fought 'em, hard as any man. But I never yet drew a bead on a squaw or papoose, and I despise the man who would. The natives, lacking artillery, could not make much resistance. Some of the natives cut horses from the camp's herd and fled up Sand Creek or to a nearby Cheyenne camp on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill River. Others, including the half-Cheyenne, half-white trader George Bent, fled upstream and dug holes in the sand beneath the banks of the stream. They were pursued by the troops and fired on, but many survived.[43] Cheyenne warrior Morning Star said that most of the Indian dead were killed by cannon fire, especially those firing from the south bank of the river at the people retreating up the creek.[44] In testimony before a Congressional committee investigating the massacre, Chivington claimed that as many as 500 to 600 Indian warriors were killed.[45] Historian Alan Brinkley wrote that 133 Indians were killed, 105 of whom were women and children.[46] White eyewitness John S. Smith reported that 70 to 80 Indians were killed, including 20 to 30 warriors,[2] which agrees with Brinkley's figure as to the number of men killed. George Bent, the son of the American William Bent and a Cheyenne mother, who was in the village when the attack came and was wounded by the soldiers, gave two different accounts of the natives' loss. On March 15, 1889, he wrote to Samuel F. Tappan that 137 people were killed: 28 men and 109 women and children.[47] However, on April 30, 1913, when he was very old, he wrote that \"about 53 men\" and \"110 women and children\" were killed and many people wounded.[48] Although initial reports indicated 10 soldiers killed and 38 wounded, the final tally was 4 killed and 21 wounded in the 1st Colorado Cavalry and 20 killed or mortally wounded and 31 other wounded in the 3rd Colorado Cavalry; adding up to 24 killed and 52 wounded.[2] Dee Brown wrote that some of Chivington's men were drunk and that many of the soldiers' casualties were due to friendly fire,[49] but neither of these claims is supported by Gregory F. Michno[50] or Stan Hoig[51] in their books devoted to the massacre. Before Chivington and his men left the area, they plundered the teepees and took the horses. After the smoke cleared, Chivington's men came back and killed many of the wounded. They also scalped many of the dead, regardless of whether they were women, children, or infants. Chivington and his men dressed their weapons, hats, and gear with scalps and other body parts, including human fetuses and male and female genitalia.[52] They also publicly displayed these battle trophies in Denver's Apollo Theater and area saloons. Three Indians who remained in the village are known to have survived the massacre: George Bent's brother Charlie Bent, and two Cheyenne women who were later turned over to William Bent.[53] According to western author and historian Larry McMurtry, the son of Chivington's scout John Smith (by an Indian mother) was in the camp, survived the attack and was \"executed\" afterward.[54]"

        "header": "Aftermath",
        "content": "The Sand Creek Massacre resulted in a heavy loss of life, mostly among Cheyenne and Arapaho women and children. The hardest hit by the massacre were the Wutapiu, Black Kettle's band. Perhaps half of the Hevhaitaniu were lost, including the chiefs Yellow Wolf and Big Man. The Oivimana, led by War Bonnet, lost about half their number. There were heavy losses to the Hisiometanio (Ridge Men) under White Antelope. Chief One Eye was also killed, along with many of his band. The Suhtai clan and the Heviqxnipahis clan under chief Sand Hill experienced relatively few losses. The Dog Soldiers and the Masikota, who by that time had allied, were not present at Sand Creek.[55] Of about 10 lodges of Arapaho under Chief Left Hand, representing about 50 or 60 people, only a handful escaped with their lives.[56] After hiding all day above the camp in holes dug beneath the bank of Sand Creek, the survivors there, many of whom were wounded, moved up the stream and spent the night on the prairie. Trips were made to the site of the camp but very few survivors were found there. After a cold night without shelter, the survivors set out toward the Cheyenne camp on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill River. They soon met up with other survivors who had escaped with part of the horse herd, some returning from the Smoky Hill camp where they had fled during the attack. They then proceeded to the camp, where they received assistance.[57] The massacre disrupted the traditional Cheyenne power structure, because of the deaths of eight members of the Council of Forty-Four. White Antelope, One Eye, Yellow Wolf, Big Man, Bear Man, War Bonnet, Spotted Crow, and Bear Robe were all killed, as were the headmen of some of the Cheyenne military societies.[58] Among the chiefs killed were most of those who had advocated peace with white settlers and the U.S. government.[59] The net effect of the murders and ensuing weakening of the peace faction exacerbated the developing social and political rift. Traditional council chiefs, mature men who sought consensus and looked to the future of their people, and their followers, were opposed by the younger and more militaristic Dog Soldiers. Beginning in the 1830s, the Dog Soldiers had evolved from a Cheyenne military society of that name into a separate band of Cheyenne and Lakota warriors. They took as their territory the area around the headwaters of the Republican and Smoky Hill rivers in southern Nebraska, northern Kansas, and the northeastern Colorado Territory. By the 1860s, as the conflict between Indians and encroaching whites intensified, the Dog Soldiers and military societies within other Cheyenne bands countered the influence of the traditional Council of Forty-Four chiefs who, as more mature men, took a larger view and were more likely to favor peace with the whites.[60] To the Dog Soldiers, the Sand Creek massacre illustrated the folly of the peace chiefs' policy of accommodating the whites through treaties such as the first Treaty of Fort Laramie and the Treaty of Fort Wise.[9] They believed their militant position toward the whites was justified by the massacre.[60] The events at Sand Creek dealt a fatal blow to the traditional Cheyenne clan system and the authority of its Council of Chiefs. It had already been weakened by the numerous deaths due to the 1849 cholera epidemic, which killed perhaps half the Southern Cheyenne population, especially the Masikota and Oktoguna bands.[61] It was further weakened by the emergence of the separate Dog Soldiers band.[62]"

        "content": "After the brutal slaughter of those who supported peace, many of the Cheyenne, including the great warrior Roman Nose, and many Arapaho joined the Dog Soldiers. They sought revenge on settlers throughout the Platte valley, including an 1865 attack on what became Fort Caspar, Wyoming. Following the massacre, the survivors reached the camps of the Cheyenne on the Smokey Hill and Republican rivers. The war pipe was smoked and passed from camp to camp among the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors in the area. In January 1865, they planned and carried out an attack with 1,000 warriors on the stage station and fort, then called Camp Rankin, at present-day Julesburg, Colorado. This was followed by numerous raids along the South Platte both east and west of Julesburg, and a second raid on the town of Julesburg in early February. The bulk of the Indians then moved north into Nebraska on their way to the Black Hills and the Powder River Country.[63] Black Kettle continued to speak for peace and did not join in the second raid or in the journey to the Powder River country. He left the camp and returned with 80 lodges to the Arkansas River to seek peace with the Coloradans.[64]"

        "header": "Official investigations",
        "content": "Initially, the Sand Creek engagement was reported as a victory against a brave and numerous foe. Within weeks, however, witnesses and survivors began telling stories of a possible massacre. Several investigations were conducted\u2014two by the military, and one by the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. The panel declared:[65] As to Colonel Chivington, your committee can hardly find fitting terms to describe his conduct. Wearing the uniform of the United States, which should be the emblem of justice and humanity; holding the important position of commander of a military district, and therefore having the honor of the government to that extent in his keeping, he deliberately planned and executed a foul and dastardly massacre which would have disgraced the veriest savage among those who were the victims of his cruelty. Having full knowledge of their friendly character, having himself been instrumental to some extent in placing them in their position of fancied security, he took advantage of their in-apprehension and defenceless condition to gratify the worst passions that ever cursed the heart of man.\nIn conclusion, your committee are of the opinion that for the purpose of vindicating the cause of justice and upholding the honor of the nation, prompt and energetic measures should be at once taken to remove from office those who have thus disgraced the government by whom they are employed, and to punish, as their crimes deserve, those who have been guilty of these brutal and cowardly acts. Statements taken by Major Edward W. Wynkoop and his adjutant substantiated the later accounts of survivors. These statements were filed with his reports and can be found in the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, copies of which were submitted as evidence in the Joint Committee of the Conduct of the War and in separate hearings conducted by the military in Denver. Lieutenant James D. Cannon describes the mutilation of human genitalia by the soldiers, \"men, women, and children's privates cut out. I heard one man say that he had cut a woman's private parts out and had them for exhibition on a stick. I heard of one instance of a child, a few months old, being thrown into the feed-box of a wagon, and after being carried some distance, left on the ground to perish; I also heard of numerous instances in which men had cut out the private parts of females and stretched them over their saddle-bows, and some of them over their hats.\"[66] During these investigations, numerous witnesses came forward with damning testimony, almost all of which was corroborated by other witnesses. One witness, Captain Silas Soule, who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons,[citation needed] was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony. \u201cBefore I got into the creek there were troops upon both sides firing across. It was unsafe for me to take my command up the creek,\u201d Soule testified. He only testified about his concern for crossfire; he never testified that he refused to fight.[67] However, despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars' recommendation, no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre. Chivington was beyond the reach of army justice because he had already resigned his commission. The closest thing to a punishment he suffered was the effective end of his political aspirations. A monument installed on the Colorado State Capitol grounds in 1909 lists Sand Creek as one of the \"battles and engagements\" fought by Colorado troops in the American Civil War. In 2002, the Colorado Historical Society (now History Colorado), authorized by the Colorado General Assembly, added an additional plaque to the monument, which states that the original designers of the monument \"mischaracterized\" Sand Creek by calling it a battle.[68]"

It promised the Indians free access to the lands south of the Arkansas River, excluded them from the Arkansas River north to the Platte River, and promised land and cash reparations to the surviving descendants of Sand Creek victims. However, the treaty was abrogated by Washington less than two years later, all major provisions were ignored, and instead, the Medicine Lodge Treaty reduced the reservation lands by 90 percent, located in much less desirable sites in Oklahoma. Later government actions further reduced the size of the reservations."

The Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site was dedicated on April 28, 2007, almost 142 years after the massacre.[70] The American Battlefield Trust and its partners preserved 640 acres (260\u00a0ha) of Sand Creek and deeded it to the national historic site.[71] The precise location of the National Park Service historic site is disputed by Chuck and Mike Bowen in their self-published book.[72] According to National Park Service, the Indians were camped below the bluff of today's historic site and they did not see the soldiers coming. Yet no period artifacts have been found below that bluff, whereas over 4,000 artifacts have been found starting about two miles up the creek from the NPS site on private property belonging to the Bowen family. It is there where Black Kettle and the Indians were camped. According to George Bent, the Indians saw the soldiers coming from miles away. Little Bear got up early in the morning and crossed the dry creek bed to get his horse. From a high hill, he looked south toward the Fort Lyon Trail and saw approaching soldiers that looked like a long black line on the horizon, (Bent to Hyde 4-14-1906).[73] An exhibit about Sand Creek, titled Collision: The Sand Creek Massacre 1860s\u2013Today, opened in 2012 with the new History Colorado Center in Denver. The exhibit immediately drew criticism from members of the Northern Cheyenne tribe. In April 2013, History Colorado agreed to close the exhibit to public view while consultations were made with the Northern Cheyenne.[74] On December 3, 2014, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper formally apologized to descendants of Sand Creek massacre victims gathered in Denver to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the event. Hickenlooper stated, \"We should not be afraid to criticize and condemn that which is inexcusable. ... On behalf of the State of Colorado, I want to apologize. We will not run from this history.\"[75][76] In 2015, construction of a memorial to the Sand Creek Massacre victims began on the Colorado Capitol grounds.[77][needs update] In October 2022, it was announced that almost 3,500 acres (14\u00a0km2) would be added to the National Historic Site to preserve for the tribes. \"The Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes are excited to see the additional 3,478 acres to the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site which is providing security for the protection of our Sacred site,\" said Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes Governor Reggie Wassana in a statement. President Biden's Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced of the preservation, \"It is our solemn responsibility at the Department of the Interior, as caretakers of America's national treasures, to tell the story of our nation. The events that took place here forever changed the course of the Northern Cheyenne, Northern Arapaho, and Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes.\"[78]"

It was caused by a lightning strike and was first detected on the morning of June 9, 2012.[3] It was declared 100 percent contained on June 30, 2012, and all associated evacuation orders were lifted.[1] Disambiguation. In 2022 there was another fire called \"High Park Fire.\" That fire started on 05/12/2022 6 miles west of Cripple Creek Colorado. The size at 89% containment (last report) was 1,572 acres.[4] Since wildland fire names are typically assigned by personnel on the fire and often based on local knowledge, it is not unusual to have more than one fire with the same name. A 62-year-old woman was killed in the fire.[2][5] The High Park fire burned over 87,284 acres (136.381\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 353.23\u00a0km2), at the time it was the second-largest fire in recorded Colorado history by area burned.

The fire was reported as a smoke column early in the morning on June 9, 2012. The area had been suffering from hot and dry conditions and fire danger was extreme. Multiple agencies responded for the initial attack, including http://www.rcvfd.org Rist Canyon Volunteer Fire Department (the fire started in RCVFD's area), Larimer County Emergency Services, Poudre Fire Authority, Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District, Colorado State Forest Service, USFS, and other local agencies. A SEAT (Single Engine Air Tanker) and helicopter were ordered immediately. The ignition point and foot of the fire was accessible only via 4wd road that would support apparatus no larger than Type 6x NWCG Engine Standards. The fire was named High Park as this is the local name for the area it burned. Due to extreme burning conditions, poor access and rapid fire-spread, it became quickly clear the fire would impact multiple residential areas and evacuations were called for an increasing area through the day. Areas evacuated included Buckhorn Canyon, Paradise Parke, Stove Prairie, Flower Road, Rist Canyon, Paradise Park, Poudre Park, Poudre Canyon, Davis Ranch, Whale Rock, Pine Acres and other areas. The evacuation lasted nearly 21 days \u2013\u2013 much longer than other large Colorado fires. Evacuation was conducted via reverse 911 calls, then by door-to-door visits by Fire Department and Law Enforcement. Since the area was served by overhead power and phone lines, power and phone were lost very rapidly. Furthermore, the area was not served by cellular service. These factors, plus damage to basic infrastructure, were key limiters in re-patriation. Residents would be returning to very dangerous conditions and with no effective communications. High Park Fire burned aggressively and with high intensity for days. Two weeks after its ignition,  the fire burned into a subdivision north of the Poudre River, where, despite days of preparation,  it destroyed more than fifty homes."

        "content": " The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (Lakota: Waz\u00ed Ah\u00e1\u014bha\u014b Oy\u00e1\u014bke), also called Pine Ridge Agency, is an Oglala Lakota Indian reservation located in the U.S. state of South Dakota, with a small portion of it extending into Nebraska. Originally included within the territory of the Great Sioux Reservation, Pine Ridge was created by the Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888. in the southwest corner of South Dakota on the Nebraska border. It consists of 3,468.85\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (8,984\u00a0km2) of land area and is one of the largest reservations in the United States.[4] The reservation encompasses the entirety of Oglala Lakota County and Bennett County, the southern half of Jackson County, and a small section of Sheridan County added by Executive Order No. 2980 of February 20, 1904. Of the 3,142 counties in the United States, these are among the poorest. Only 84,000 acres (340\u00a0km2) of land are suitable for agriculture. The 2000 census population of the reservation was 15,521. A 2009 study by Colorado State University and accepted by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has estimated the resident population to reach 28,787.[5] Pine Ridge is the site of several events that mark milestones in the history between the Sioux of the area and the U.S. government. Stronghold Table, a mesa in what is today the Oglala-administered portion of Badlands National Park, was the location of the last of the Ghost Dances. U.S. authorities repressed this movement, eventually leading to the Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29, 1890. A mixed band of Miniconjou Lakota and Hunkpapa Sioux, led by Chief Spotted Elk, sought sanctuary at Pine Ridge after fleeing the Standing Rock Agency, where Sitting Bull had been killed during efforts to arrest him. The families were intercepted and attacked by a heavily armed detachment of the Seventh Cavalry, which killed many women and children as well as warriors. This was the last large engagement between U.S. forces and Native Americans and marked the end of the western frontier. Changes accumulated in the last quarter of the 20th century: in 1971 the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) started Oglala Lakota College, a tribal college, which offers 4-year degrees. In 1973 decades of discontent at the Pine Ridge Reservation resulted in a grassroots protest that escalated into the Wounded Knee Incident, gaining national attention. Members of the Oglala Lakota, the American Indian Movement and supporters occupied the town in defiance of federal and state law enforcement in a protest that turned into an armed standoff lasting 71 days. This event inspired American Indians across the country and gradually led to changes at the reservation. It has revived some cultural traditions and encouraged language training. In 1981 Tim Giago (Lakota) started the Lakota Times at Pine Ridge. Located at the southern end of the Badlands, the reservation is part of the mixed grass prairie, an ecological transition zone between the short-grass and tall-grass prairies; all are part of the Great Plains. A great variety of plant and animal life flourishes on and adjacent to the reservation, including the endangered black-footed ferret. The area is also important in the field of paleontology; it contains deposits of Pierre Shale formed on the seafloor of the Western Interior Seaway, evidence of the marine Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary, and one of the largest deposits of fossils of extinct mammals from the Oligocene epoch."

The Red Cloud Agency was established for the Oglala Lakota in 1871 on the North Platte River in Wyoming Territory. The location was one mile (1.6\u00a0km) west of the present town of Henry, Nebraska. The location of the Red Cloud Agency was moved to two other locations before being settled at the present Pine Ridge location. Pine Ridge Reservation was originally part of the Great Sioux Reservation established by the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. It encompassed approximately 60 million contiguous acres (240,000\u00a0km2) of western South Dakota (all of what is now called West River), northern Nebraska and eastern Wyoming."

        "content": "In 1874, George Armstrong Custer led the U.S. Army Black Hills Expedition, which set out on July 2 from Fort Abraham Lincoln in the Dakota Territory, with orders to travel to the previously uncharted Black Hills of South Dakota. Its mission was to look for suitable locations for a fort, find a route to the southwest, and to investigate the potential for gold mining. After the discovery of gold was made public, miners began invading Sioux Territory. \"Custer's florid descriptions of the mineral and timber resources of the Black Hills, and the land's suitability for grazing and cultivation\u00a0... received wide circulation, and had the effect of creating an intense popular demand for more settlers to invade the Black Hills.\"[7] Initially the U.S. military tried to turn away trespassing miners and settlers. Eventually President Grant, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of War, \"decided that the military should make no further resistance to the occupation of the Black Hills by miners.\"[8] These orders were to be enforced \"quietly\", and the President's decision was to remain \"confidential\".[8] As more settlers and gold miners encroached upon the Black Hills, the Government determined it had to acquire the land from the Sioux, and appointed a commission to negotiate the purchase.[9] The negotiations failed, as the Sioux resisted giving up what they considered sacred land. The U.S. resorted to military force. They declared the Sioux Indians \"hostile\" for failing to obey an order to return from an off-reservation hunting expedition by a specific date. In the dead of winter, the Sioux found the overland travel was impossible.[10] The consequent military expedition to remove the Sioux from the Black Hills included an attack on a major encampment of several bands on the Little Bighorn River. Led by General Custer, the attack ended in his defeat. It was an overwhelming victory of chiefs Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse over the 7th Cavalry Regiment, a conflict often called Custer's Last Stand.[9][11] US forces were vastly outnumbered. In 1876 the U.S. Congress decided to open up the Black Hills to development and break up the Great Sioux Reservation. In 1877, it passed an act to make 7.7 million acres (31,000\u00a0km2) of the Black Hills available for sale to homesteaders and private interests. In 1889 Congress divided the remaining area of Great Sioux Reservation into five separate reservations, defining the boundaries of each in its Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888. Pine Ridge was established at that time."

        "content": "The Wounded Knee Massacre occurred on December 29, 1890,[12] near Wounded Knee Creek (Lakota: Cankpe Opi Wakpala). On the day before, a detachment of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment commanded by Major Samuel M. Whitside intercepted Spotted Elk's (Big Foot) band of Miniconjou Lakota and 38 Hunkpapa Lakota near Porcupine Butte and escorted them 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) westward to Wounded Knee Creek where they made camp. The rest of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, led by Colonel James Forsyth, surrounded the encampment, supported by four Hotchkiss guns.[13] On the morning of December 29, 1890, the troops went into the camp to disarm the Lakota. One version of events claims that during the process, a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote was reluctant to give up his rifle, saying he had paid a lot for it.[14] A scuffle over Black Coyote's rifle escalated and a shot was fired, which resulted in the 7th Cavalry opening firing indiscriminately from all sides, killing men, women, and children, as well as some of their fellow troopers. Those few Lakota warriors who still had weapons began shooting back at the troopers, who quickly suppressed the Lakota fire. The surviving Lakota fled, but U.S. cavalrymen pursued and killed many who were unarmed. In the end, U.S. forces killed at least 150 men, women, and children of the Lakota Sioux and wounded 51 (four men, and 47 women and children, some of whom died later); some estimates placed the number of dead at 300. Twenty-five troopers also died, and thirty-nine were wounded (six of the wounded would also die).[15] Many Army deaths were believed to have been caused by friendly fire, as the shooting took place at close range in chaotic conditions.[16] The site has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is administered by the National Park Service.[12]"

        "content": "In 1882, at the urging of Valentine McGillycuddy\u2014the US Indian Agent at the Pine President Agency\u2014President Chester A. Arthur issued an executive order establishing the White Clay Extension, an area of land in Nebraska extending 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) south of the reservation's border and 10 miles (16\u00a0km) wide approximately perpendicular to the road leading north into the town of Pine Ridge on the reservation.[17] This road is today's Nebraska Highway 87. McGillycuddy lobbied for the buffer zone to prevent white peddlers from engaging in the illegal sale of \"knives, guns, and alcohol\" to the Oglala Lakota residents of Pine Ridge. A law passed in Congress in 1832 banned the sale of alcohol to Native Americans. The ban was ended in 1953 by Public Law 277, signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The amended law gave Native American tribes the option of permitting or banning alcohol sales and consumption on their lands.[18] The OST and many other tribes chose to exclude alcohol from their reservations because of the problems for their people. In 1887, when Congress enacted the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887\u2014breaking up the reservations and allotting a 160 acres (65\u00a0ha) plot to the registered head of each family\u2014the Whiteclay Extension was specifically exempted. On March 2, 1889, the U.S. Congress enacted the Great Sioux Agreement of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888, breaking up the Great Sioux Reservation and setting boundaries for the six reduced reservations. In this act, the White Clay Extension was incorporated again within the boundaries of the Pine Ridge Agency. \"Provided, That the said tract of land in the State of Nebraska shall be reserved, by Executive order, only so long as it may be needed for the use and protection of the Indians receiving rations and annuities at the Pine Ridge Agency.\"[19] On January 25, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt signed an executive order returning the 50 square miles (130\u00a0km2) of the White Clay Extension to the public domain. The town of Whiteclay in Sheridan County, Nebraska, just over the border from the reservation, was founded in the former \"Extension\" zone. Merchants quickly started selling alcohol to the Oglala Sioux. It is hereby ordered that the tract of country in the State of Nebraska \"withdrawn from sale and set aside as an addition to the present Sioux Indian Reservation in the Territory of Dakota\" by Executive order dated January 24, 1882, be, and the same hereby is, restored to the public domain. On February 20, 1904, Roosevelt amended the executive order to return 1 square mile (2.6\u00a0km2) back to Pine Ridge: \"the section of land embracing the Pine Ridge Boarding School irrigation ditch and the school pasture\"."

        "content": "In the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration made changes in federal policy to improve conditions for American Indians. In response to complaints about corruption and injustices in the BIA management of reservations, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, permitting tribal nations to reorganize with self-government. It encouraged them to adopt a model of elected representative governments and elected tribal chairmen or presidents, with written constitutions. While tribes welcomed taking back more control of their government, this change eroded the power and structure of the traditional hereditary leaders of the clan system. The Oglala Sioux Tribe developed a tribal government along democratic constitutional lines, with a chairman to be elected for a two-year term. This short term makes it difficult for leaders to accomplish longer-term projects, but the tribe has not changed its constitution. The BIA still has had the ability to oversee some tribal operations, including the police. Historically BIA tribal police were often assigned from other Indian tribes rather than representing local people and understanding their culture, which created tensions.[23] Many traditionalists among the Oglala Lakota never supported the new style of government. Tribal elders were still respected, and there were multiple lines of authority and influence among different groups on the reservation. Political factions also formed between those who were mixed-bloods or had urban experiences, and those who were full-bloods and tended to be more traditional in practices and culture.[23] The people continued to be under assimilation pressure: through the early part of the century, many children were sent away to Indian boarding schools where they were usually required to speak English and were prohibited from speaking Lakota. They were usually expected to practice Christianity rather than native religions. In the late 20th century, many of these institutions were found to have had staff who abused the children in their care.[24]"

The largest portion is located in Oglala Lakota County. It also leased communally held Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) land for this defense installation. Among the 125 families evicted was that of Pat Cuny, an Oglala Sioux. He fought in World War II in the Battle of the Bulge after surviving torpedoing of his transport in the English Channel.[25] Dewey Beard, a Miniconjou Sioux survivor of the Wounded Knee Massacre, who supported himself by raising horses on his 908-acre (3.67\u00a0km2) allotment received in 1907 was also evicted. The small federal payments were insufficient to enable such persons to buy new properties. In 1955, the 97-year-old Beard testified of earlier mistreatment at Congressional hearings about this project.[26] He said, for \"fifty years I have been kicked around. Today there is a hard winter coming. ... I might starve to death.\"[citation needed] Since 1960, the U.S. has returned portions[specify] of the bombing range to the OST.

Longstanding divisions on the reservation resulted from deep-seated political, ethnic and cultural differences. Many residents did not support the elected tribal government. Many residents were upset about what they described as the autocratic and repressive actions by the tribal president Dick Wilson, elected in 1972. On February 21, the tribal council was called into session to consider the removal of Wilson through impeachment. Five hundred Oglala members were in attendance. He was criticized for favoring family and friends with jobs and benefits, not consulting with the tribal council, and creating a private militia, known as the Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONs), to suppress political opponents. He used tribal funds to pay for this force. Wilson's response was to screen a right wing propaganda film.[29] After a series of meetings held in the Calico community near the Pine Ridge Agency, the old traditional chiefs and the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO) called down to AIM in Rapid City and asked them to come to Pine Ridge. A meeting was arranged between Wilson and Russell Means. Five of Wilson's supporters cornered Means in the parking lot. Means escaped.[30] Women elders such as Ellen Moves Camp, founder of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO), called for action. They organized a public protest for the next day.[24] About 200 AIM and Oglala Lakota activists occupied the hamlet of Wounded Knee on February 27, 1973. They demanded the removal of Wilson, restoration of treaty negotiations with the U.S. government, and correction of U.S. failures to enforce treaty rights. Visits by the U.S. senators from South Dakota, FBI agents and United States Department of Justice (DOJ) representatives, were attended by widespread media coverage, but the Richard Nixon administration was preoccupied internally with Watergate.[24] As the events evolved, the activists at Wounded Knee had a 71-day armed stand-off with U.S. law enforcement. AIM leaders at the site were Russell Means, Dennis Banks, Clyde Bellecourt, and Carter Camp. Traditional spiritual leaders of the Lakota, such as Frank Fools Crow, were also prominent. Fools Crow led Oglala Lakota spiritual ceremonies and practice in their ways for participants.[24] Joseph H. Trimbach of the FBI and Steve Frizell of DOJ led the government.[24] Casualties of gunfire included a U.S. Marshal, who was seriously wounded and paralyzed; and the deaths of Frank Clearwater, a Cherokee from North Carolina, and Buddy Lamont, a local Oglala Lakota. After Lamont's death, the Oglala Lakota elders called an end to the occupation.[24] Some Lakota have alleged that Ray Robinson, a civil rights activist, was killed during the Wounded Knee occupation, as he disappeared there.[31][32] The stand-off ended, but Wilson remained in office. The U.S. government said it could not remove an elected tribal official as the Oglala Sioux Tribe had sovereignty.[24]\nEnsuing open conflict between factions caused numerous deaths. The murder rate between March 1, 1973, and March 1, 1976, was 170 per 100,000; it was the highest in the country.[33] More than 60 opponents of the tribal government allegedly died violent deaths in the three years following the Wounded Knee Incident, a period called the \"Reign of Terror\" by many residents. Among those killed was Pedro Bissonette, executive director of the civil rights organization OSCRO.[34] Residents accused officials of failing to try to solve the deaths.[35] In 2000, the FBI released a report regarding the 57 alleged unsolved violent deaths on Pine Ridge Reservation and accounted for most of the deaths, and disputed the claims of unsolved murders. The report stated that only 4 deaths were unsolved and that some deaths were not murders.[36][37] AIM representatives criticized the FBI report.[38]"

Three federal grand juries were called to hear testimony on the Aquash murder: in 1976, 1982 and 1994, but it was more than a quarter of a century before any suspects were indicted and tried for the crime.[41] Two AIM members, Arlo Looking Cloud and John Graham, were convicted of her murder in 2004 and 2010 respectively, and sentenced to life in prison.

Since 1999, activists from the Pine Ridge Reservation, AIM, and Nebraskans for Peace have worked to have beer sales shut down in nearby Whiteclay, Nebraska, a border town. Whiteclay sells millions of cans of beer annually, primarily to residents from the reservation in South Dakota, where alcohol possession and consumption is prohibited. In 2008, the documentary The Battle for Whiteclay, about the toll of alcoholism and activists' efforts to control beer sales, was released, which has attracted wide attention. The Nebraska legislature allocated funds in late 2010 for increased police patrols in Pine Ridge by the county sheriff's office, based 22 miles (35\u00a0km) away in Rushville. While other tribes and reservations also prohibited alcohol at one time, many have since legalized its sales on their reservations. They use the revenues generated to improve health care and life on the reservation, and they prefer to directly control the regulation of alcohol sales and police its use. A 2007 survey found that 63% of federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states have legalized liquor sales on their reservations.[44] They include the nearby Sicangu Oyate or Brul\u00e9 Sioux at the Rosebud Indian Reservation, also located in South Dakota. In 2006, the Omaha Nation in northeastern Nebraska started requiring payment of tribal license fees and sales taxes by liquor stores located in towns within its reservation boundaries in order to benefit in the revenues generated by alcohol sales.[45] Activists at Pine Ridge have worked to persuade Nebraska to enforce its own laws and support the tribe's prohibition. In 2004 the Oglala Sioux Tribe voted down a referendum to legalize alcohol sales, and in 2006 the tribal council voted to maintain the ban on alcohol sales, rather than taking on the benefits and responsibility directly.[44] At a discussion at Bellevue University on April 2, 2010, Lance Morgan, CEO of Ho-Chunk, Inc.\u2014the development corporation of the Winnebago Reservation\u2014said the Oglala Sioux needed to concentrate on economic development. He believes that poverty is at the heart of its people's problems.[46] The Winnebago used revenues from a casino and alcohol sales at their reservation in eastern Nebraska to build an economic development corporation. It now employs 1,400 people in 26 subsidiaries. With its revenues, the Winnebago have been able to build a hospital, a new school and $1 million in new housing. Kevin Abourezk reported that Stew Magnuson\u2014the author of The Death of Raymond Yellow Thunder, a study of issues related to the Pine Ridge reservation and its border towns\u2014described alcohol prohibition at the reservation \"as a complete failure.\"[46] Magnuson said, \"Whenever you have prohibition, you're going to have places like Whiteclay.\"[46] He thought prohibition contributed to bootlegging on the reservation. On February 9, 2012, the Oglala Sioux Tribe filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court of Nebraska against the four liquor stores in Whiteclay, Nebraska, as well as the beverage distributors and the brewery companies who make it. The suit, Oglala Sioux Tribe v. Jason Schwarting, Licensee of Arrowhead Inn, Inc. et al, sought $500 million in damages for the \"cost of health care, social services and child rehabilitation caused by chronic alcoholism on the reservation, which encompasses some of the nation's most impoverished counties.\"[47] The suit claims that the defendants knowingly and willingly sell excessive amounts of alcohol, knowing that most of it is smuggled onto the reservation, in violation of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and Federal law. The defendants listed in the suit are the following:[48][49] On August 14, 2013, voters voted to end prohibition and legalize alcohol, so the tribe can use the profits for education and detoxification and treatment centers.[62]"

        "content": "While many residents have continued to struggle with the tribal government, BIA and other federal representatives, some have become more politically active in other ways. In 2002, the Pine Ridge Reservation was part of a statewide voter registration campaign organized by the Democratic Party. That year, Oglala Lakota candidates won offices in Bennett County; since the 1990s, Native Americans (mostly Lakota) have become a majority of the county's population. Charles Cummings was elected as county sheriff, Gerald 'Jed' Bettelyoun to one of the positions as county commissioner, and Sandy Flye became the first Native American elected to a seat on the county school board. Statewide turnout by Native Americans helped elect the Democratic candidate Tim Johnson to the U.S. Senate by a narrow margin.[67] In 1992, John Yellow Bird Steele was elected president of the OST, the first of what would become a record-setting seven terms as president.[68][69] Despite winning seven elections, Steele only won re-election once, in 2002.[70] In most cases, he was defeated when seeking re-election, only to come back and defeat his successor in the next election (or, in the case of the 2006 election, to defeat the person serving out the rest of his successor's term).[71] In 2004, Cecilia Fire Thunder became the first woman elected president of the OST, defeating the incumbent Steele and Russell Means.[72] In 2005 she led negotiations with Nebraska to strengthen law enforcement in Whiteclay by hiring more Oglala tribal police and having them deputized by Nebraska to patrol in the town. The town sells massive quantities of alcohol to the Lakota, although it is illegal on the reservation.[dubious \u2013 discuss] The \"historic agreement\" was signed by Fire Thunder following approval by the tribal council, the Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman and State Attorney General Jon Bruning.[73] On March 21, 2006, Fire Thunder announced her plan to bring a Planned Parenthood clinic to the reservation to improve health services to women. The South Dakota state legislature had recently passed a stringent abortion law.[72] In May 2006, the Oglala Sioux tribal council unanimously voted to ban all abortions on the reservation, regardless of the circumstances. The council also voted to suspend Fire Thunder for 20 days pending an impeachment hearing.[74] On June 29, 2006, the tribal council voted to impeach Fire Thunder: it said that founding the clinic was outside her authority and she had failed to consult with them. Her two-year term would have expired in October 2006. In November 2006, state voters reviewed the law passed by the state legislature, and they overwhelmingly defeated the ban on abortions without exceptions, by 55.57 percent to 44.43 percent. A ban with exceptions was proposed in 2008, and state voters rejected that by a margin of 55.21 percent to 44.79 percent.[75] The U.S. Congress supported Fire Thunder's tribal law enforcement initiative, earmarking $200,000 over two years to pay for the increased cost of OST police patrols in Whiteclay. By May 2007, the tribe had spent none of the money. Fire Thunder's impeachment and tribal political conflict appeared to prevent its implementing the agreement.[73] During 2006 and 2007, tribal activists tried to blockade the road inside the reservation to confiscate beer being illegally brought in. The OST police chief complained of having insufficient money and staff to control the beer traffic.[76] The tribe lost the earmarked funds and let the initiative lapse. In November 2008, Theresa Two Bulls, a Democratic State Senator for South Dakota since 2004, became the second woman elected president of the OST. She succeeded Steele and defeated Russell Means.[77] When the reservation had a rash of suicides in late 2009, she declared a state of emergency and organized a call-in to President Barack Obama. She organized services during a blizzard to assist residents in outlying areas on the reservation.[78] Steele was re-elected in 2010, defeating Two Bulls. Bryan Brewer was elected as Tribal president in November 2012, defeating the incumbent Steele with 52% of the vote. A retired educator and school administrator, he was new to tribal politics. He worked to develop housing and discourage alcoholism, even leading a protest against Whiteclay alcohol sales.[79][80] The journalist Brian Ecoffey noted that Brewer represented a \"new direction\" for the tribe, as he had not held political office before.[81] Steele then defeated Brewer in 2014, starting what would be Steele's last term.[82][83] Troy \"Scott\" Weston represented the Porcupine District in the 2010 and 2012 administrations; Weston was elected OST President in 2016 beating Steele, the incumbent, in a landslide victory. The Rapid City Journal reported that nearly 2/3 of voters at the polls cast their ballot for Weston.[84] In national elections, Pine Ridge is politically divided: the western half of the reservation (Oglala Lakota County) votes overwhelmingly Democratic at the national level, while the eastern half (Bennett and Jackson Counties) trends heavily Republican. In local politics, the Oglala are active in electing tribal members to the State House and Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans finding success on the reservation."

In 1878, Congress authorized the formation of an Indian police force to provide law enforcement in Indian territory and upon reservations. They were superseded by police assigned and managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The BIA police force is composed of members of various Native American tribes from throughout the United States, and personnel often do not belong to the nations they oversee. Since the late 1970s, the Oglala Sioux Tribe has received Federal funding to maintain its own reservation police, supplemented by BIA personnel. The FBI has jurisdiction for any felony crimes committed upon the reservation. After the reservation police respond to the initial call, a BIA police person initiates the investigation and notifies the FBI.[99] The OST is developing a new Tribal Justice Center, to include the tribal courts and a restorative justice courtroom. The latter concept relates to traditional Lakota ideas about restoring the victim and offender to balance within the community. In practice, it is intended to bring together the affected parties in facilitated communication, together with members of the community; to settle on a form of reparation or compensation by the offender that is satisfactory to the victim, which may include money, public apology, and/or community service work; and to bring the offender quickly back within the community with its support for the future.

As the journalist Stephanie Woodward noted, little money changes hands within the reservation.[106] As an example of the money that goes outside the reservation to border towns, the owner of Whiteclay's grocery store, Arrowhead Foods, said he \"did more than a million dollars in business last year, with an entirely Native American clientele.\"[106] Similarly, Nebraska State Senator LeRoy J. Louden, whose district includes Whiteclay, noted the recent construction of a Walmart superstore at Chadron, Nebraska, another border town. He said, \"That store was built because of the reservation.\"[106] The tribe has prohibited sale and consumption of alcohol on the reservation, but Pine Ridge residents support four liquor stores at Whiteclay, which in 2010 paid federal and state excise taxes (included in liquor's sale price) of $413,932, according to the state liquor commission.[106] Some residents have argued that the continuing rate of alcoholism on the reservation shows the failure of the prohibition policy. They say that if the tribe legalized alcohol sales, it could keep much of the revenues now flowing to Nebraska and to state and federal taxes, and use such monies to bolster the reservation's economy and health care services, including building a much-needed detoxification facility and rehab services. Despite the lack of formal employment opportunities on Pine Ridge, considerable agricultural production is taking place on the reservation. Only a small percentage of the tribe directly benefits from this, as land is leased to agricultural producers. According to the USDA, in 2002 there was nearly $33 million in receipts from agricultural production on Pine Ridge. Less than one-third of that income went to members of the tribe.[127] Most employment on the reservation is provided by community institutions, such as the tribal Oglala Lakota College, and other schools; the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA); and the U.S. Indian Health Service (IHS). In October 2016 the tribe opened an 80-bed nursing home; at full operation it will employ 100 staff. The tribe is working on a justice center and has advertised an art competition for works for its spaces, to include the tribal courts and a restorative justice courtroom. Enterprises owned by the Oglala Sioux tribe include the Prairie Wind Casino, a Parks and Recreation Department, guided hunting, and cattle ranching and farming.[128] The Oglala Sioux Tribe also operates the White River Visitor Center near the Badlands National Park.[129] It has one radio station, KILI-FM in Porcupine. In 1973 at the time of the Wounded Knee Incident, not one Native American worked for a South Dakota newspaper. In 1981 the Lakota journalist Tim Giago founded and published the independent Lakota Times on the reservation. (Most such newspapers have been owned by tribal governments.)[130] He renamed it Indian Country Today in 1992, as he was providing more national coverage of Native American news.[131] In 1998 he sold the paper to the Oneida Nation; it was then the largest independent Native American paper in the country. It continues to operate the paper as part of a media network; Indian Country Today features regular political coverage that notes the increasing number of Native Americans gaining office at the local and state levels. Giago founded the Native American Journalists Association (NAJA) and has worked to recruit Native American students into journalism through its foundation, as well as to establish Indian studies in journalism schools.[131] Connie Smith started the Lakota Country Times, a weekly newspaper which she owns. It is the official legal newspaper for the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations. It also publishes material online. In 2009 it won first place for general excellence of its website from NAJA, and in 2010 won three prizes, including two for best articles.[132] Lakota Federal Credit Union, established to serve the financial needs of residents of the reservation, was established in 2012.[133]"

        "content": "After doing research and noting the worldwide market for hemp, in July 1998, the Tribal Council approved 'industrial hemp agriculture' for the reservation. With demand high for the crop, three Lakota farmers, Tom Cook, his wife Loretta Afraid of Bear and American Horse, grandson of Chief American Horse, formed the Slim Butte Land-Use Association.[134] To emphasize the issue of Sioux sovereignty in land use, they publicly announced the first planting of industrial hemp seeds on April 29, 2000, on the 132nd anniversary of the signing of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty, which established the reservation. The Association believed production of industrial hemp-based concrete could help solve the severe shortage of suitable dwellings on the reservation, as it is a sustainable construction material, and work for the unemployed. Hemp can also be processed to yield oil for cooking and other products.[135] Congress in 1968 prohibited the cultivation of Cannabis-related crops, including hemp, as part of anti-drug legislation, although hemp does not have the psychoactive properties of cannabis as a drug. Industrial hemp is legal in Canada.[136] The law in the U.S. is enforced by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). In August 2000 and July 2001, federal DEA agents destroyed industrial hemp crops on the Pine Ridge reservation.[136] After the raid destroyed his crops, the farmer Alex White Plume[136] appealed a DEA court order that prohibited his growing the crop, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court ruling in United States v. White Plume (8th Cir. 2006), that the Lakota had to comply with DEA registration process and get a permit to cultivate hemp.[137] The former crop is currently growing wild in the area.[138] The North Dakota legislature has authorized hemp growing statewide and issued the nation's first two state licenses to grow hemp. The licensed farmers may face DEA legal problems if they do not acquire DEA permits. As the DEA had not yet acted on their requests, in June 2007 the men filed a lawsuit seeking federal court permission to grow the crop without being subject to federal criminal charges.[137]"

The southern part of the reservation is crossed by Pine Ridge, which is probably a fault scarp, and which supports the growth of scattered pine and cedar trees. Well-developed sandhills are the dominant features along the southern boundary of the reservation, which extend into the sandhills region of Nebraska.[146] Only 84,000 acres (340\u00a0km2) of the more than 2\u00a0million acres (8,100\u00a0km2) of the reservation are considered land suitable for agricultural uses, and the climate, soil and water conditions are challenging. Many farmers among the Lakota can do little more than gain a subsistence living from the land.[136] The White River flows through the reservation. It was named for the water's white-gray color, a result of eroded sand, clay, and volcanic ash carried by the river.[147] Draining a basin of about 10,200 square miles (26,000\u00a0km2), the stream flows through a region of sparsely populated hills, plateaus, and badlands.[148] It flows west to east through the reservation."

Biologists have identified more than 400 different plant species growing in Badlands National Park. Each plant species is adapted to survive the conditions prevalent in the mixed-grass prairie ecosystem. The climate here is one of extremes: hot, cold, dry, windy and stormy with blizzards, floods, droughts, and fires. Grasses dominate the landscape.[150] The short-grass and tall-grass prairies intergrade just east of an irregular line that runs from northern Texas to Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska, northwestward into west-central North Dakota and South Dakota. The perimeter is not well defined because of the array of short-stature, intermediate, and tall-grass species that make up an ecotone between the short-grass and tall-grass prairies (Bragg and Steuter 1996). In general, the mixed-grass prairie is characterized by the warm-season grasses of the short-grass prairie to the west and the cool- and warm-season grasses, which grow much taller, to the east. Because of this ecotonal mixing, the number of plant species found in mixed-grass prairies exceeds that in other prairie types.[151] Since 2000, hemp has grown wild here, following a failed attempt in growing it commercially, as a local ordinance allows. The attempt was shut down by the DEA and several other agencies.[138]"

        "content": " Last Chance Saloon was a popular name of a type of bar in the United States that began to appear in the 19th century as an early expression of border economics. Saloons situated near areas where alcohol was not easily obtainable frequently took the name as a literal indication to customers that this was their final opportunity to imbibe before progressing to an area where obtaining, selling or drinking alcoholic drinks was prohibited. The phrase \"last chance saloon\" also has common British metaphorical use, based upon this historical context."

        "header": "A lot of \"last chances\"",
        "content": "While the term refers to actual places that existed, it does not refer to a singular place. Many saloons on the border of dry areas incorporated the phrase \"last chance\" into their name. Of the many saloons so named, two have found particular notoriety, to the extent that they may be sometimes be referred to today with a definite article, as in  \"The Last Chance Saloon\". The first is one in Caldwell, Kansas. Dating from 1869, it was the last place travellers could legally buy liquor before moving into Indian territory, where alcohol was banned. It gained prominence during an incident in 1874, when a posse from Caldwell burned down the building, after erroneously believing that the objects of their search were inside. Because of this fire, it does not exist today, but the building's site is currently marked by the State of Kansas as a place of historical interest.[1] The second is the \"Heinold's First and Last Chance\" in Oakland, California. It was opened in 1883. Located on the docks of Oakland, it would have been the last chance for drinkers to imbibe before falling under the jurisdiction of their boat's captain. While it was not a legally dry area, a boat could often be practically dry. Even if a captain chose to allow alcohol, it would have been relatively scarce and usually tightly regulated\u2014if the boat's hold had space for it at all. Thus, Heinold's saloon served precisely the same practical function as the Caldwell example. It was made arguably more famous because noted American author Jack London was an irregular patron. When in Oakland, London drank there often, gleaning insight from the tales of world-traveling sailors.[2] Not only is the saloon commemorated by name in London's works, it is recognized by the California State historical marker program, the National Literary Landmark scheme, and the National Register of Historic Places. Nevertheless, it continues as a working business, maintained privately for the benefit of locals and tourists. Technically, both of these businesses were also signed as \"First Chance\" saloons, as the proprietors wanted to market their business for travellers, irrespective of their customers' direction of travel.[3] The name persists in the naming of modern bars, though it is not always associated with the original meaning. Bars nowhere close to a dry county are sometimes named \"Last Chance Saloon\" as an homage to the earlier establishments. There are (First and) Last Chance Saloons in the phone books of almost every American state.[4]"

        "header": "As a metaphor",
        "content": "In everyday speech, by speakers of British English, the term has been adopted to describe a situation beyond which hope or good fortune will greatly diminish. \"This is the last chance saloon. If we again fail to improve the performance of our schools I believe it is time to look at the reintroduction of selection at the age of 13, to reintroduce grammar schools which were the great escape route for the working class in post-war Britain.\" \"At least, that's the way it had been until Monty arrived, although I have to admit we all thought: Here we go again. We've heard it all before. But he and everybody else knew very well that this had to be the last stand. We were definitely in the Last Chance Saloon.\"  Because of its infrequent use in relation to alcohol or bars, \"last chance saloon\" is usually employed as a paralogical metaphor. The expression often lends itself to newspaper headlines, as it describes a complex situation in a relatively scant number of letters. Home Office minister David Mellor in a December 1989 television interview asserted: \"I do believe the press \u2013 the popular press \u2013 is drinking in the Last Chance Saloon\".[7] The ethics of the British press were then being scrutinized by the Calcutt Committee and the phrase caught on.[7] In another example, John Major's 1995 attempt to stave off critics by calling for a Conservative Party leadership election was famously headlined in The Independent as \"John Major's Last Chance Saloon\"[8]\u2014but there are many others.[9]"

Because saloon has a uniquely British automotive meaning, applying the phrase \"last chance saloon\" to a story about cars is to use a pun. Thus, it is common to see the phrase applied to the automotive industry. For example, the launch of the Rover 75 was humorously described by the then BMW owners as \"Rover's Last Chance Saloon\", and Cerberus' 2007 acquisition of Chrysler has been called that car manufacturer's \"last chance saloon\".[10]"

Sports commentators and fans will often use the phrase in conjunction with professional or Olympic athletics to speak of a waning team or player's last opportunity to make good on their talents.[12][13]"

Most of their land was ceded under the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek of 1832.[6][7][8] Many early U.S. migrants were from Virginia,[7] supplemented by migrants from Georgia and the Carolinas.[8] In 1836, the city had 4,000 European-American residents.[7] A year later, records show that 40 residents were lawyers,[7] and there were six physicians by 1838.[8] By 1837, the town already had \"twenty dry goods stores, two drugstores, three banks, several hotels, and over ten saloons.\"[7] Hillcrest Cemetery was built on land settler William S. Randolph gave the city in 1837.[9] Newcomers established the Chalmers Institute, later known as the University of Holly Springs, Mississippi's oldest university.[10][11] The area was developed with extensive cotton plantations dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans. Many had been transported from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade, breaking up families.[7] Holly Springs served as a trading center for the neighboring cotton plantations. In 1837, it was made seat of the newly created Marshall County,[7] named for John Marshall, the Supreme Court justice. The town developed a variety of merchants and businesses to support the plantations. Its population into the early twentieth century included a community of Jewish merchants, whose ancestors were immigrants from eastern Europe in the 19th century.[12] The cotton industry suffered in the crisis of 1840, but soon recovered.[7] By 1855 Holly Springs was connected to Grand Junction, Tennessee, by the Mississippi Central Railway.[13] In ensuing years, the line was completed to the south of Hill Springs. Toward the end of the 19th century, the Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham Railroad was constructed to intersect this line in Holly Springs. During the Civil War, Union general Ulysses S. Grant temporarily used Holly Springs as a supply depot and headquarters while mounting an effort to take the city of Vicksburg.[7] Confederate general Earl Van Dorn led the successful Holly Springs Raid on the town in December 1862, destroying most of the Union supplies at the Confederate Armory Site.[7] The campus of the Holly Springs Female Institute, which had been open since 1836, was also burned, forcing it to permanently close. Grant eventually succeeded in ending the siege of Vicksburg with a Union victory. In 1878, Holly Springs suffered a yellow fever epidemic,[7] part of a regional epidemic; 1,400 residents became ill and 300 died.[7] The Marshall County courthouse, at the center of Holly Springs's square, was used as a hospital during the epidemic.[6] After the war and emancipation, many freedmen stayed in the area, working as sharecroppers on former plantations.[7] There were tensions after the war. As agriculture was mechanized in the early 20th century, there were fewer farm labor jobs. From 1900 to 1910, a quarter of the population left the city. Many blacks moved to the North in the Great Migration to escape southern oppression and seek employment in northern factories. The invasion of boll weevils in the 1920s and 1930s, which occurred across the South, destroyed the cotton crops and caused economic problems on top of the Great Depression.[7] Some light industry developed in the area.[7] After World War II, most industries moved to the major cities of Memphis, Tennessee, and Birmingham, Alabama.[7]"

        "content": "The tornado initially touched down at 6:46\u00a0p.m. CST on East Tripp Road north of US 80 on the west of Sunnyvale in Dallas County. It was initially at EF0 strength and minor roof damage was inflicted to two homes and a power pole was knocked down at the touch down point.[4] Heading in a northeastward direction, the tornado began to slowly widen as it moved through mainly empty lots, although some EF0 damage occurred. After crossing Hearthstone Drive, the tornado rapidly strengthened to EF2 intensity. Several homes suffered severe roof and exterior wall damage, including some homes that were partially unroofed, vehicles were damaged, fences were knocked down, and trees were snapped.[4] The tornado then weakened to EF1 intensity as it crossed Eagles Crest Drive, continuing to inflict roof damage to homes and damaging trees. The tornado then crossed Town East Boulevard and moved through unpopulated fields and wooded areas. There were few damage indicators in this area and an EF0 rating was given along this portion of the track. After crossing Barnes Bridge Road, the tornado rapidly intensified to EF2 strength and struck the Plantation Place Dallas RV Park. Several RVs were severely damaged, including some that were flipped and others that were obliterated, including at least one destroyed RV that was thrown into a pond in the park. Vehicles were tossed and trees were damaged in the area as well.[4] The tornado then entered the southeastern part of Garland and further intensified to EF3 strength briefly on Christina Lane. Several homes suffered extensive damage with roofs partially or completely removed and exterior walls damaged or knocked down. One unanchored home was swept off its foundation, while another saw more than half of the structure collapse. Vehicles were thrown and damaged, including a pickup truck that had its bed partially lifted off its axle and a box truck that was knocked over, a light pole was bent to the ground, and more trees and fences were damaged or knocked down. The tornado then weakened but remained strong as it continued northeastward at EF2 strength as it passed through residential areas. Many homes suffered severe roof and exterior wall damage, including some homes that were partially to completely unroofed and/or had exterior walls knocked down, and trees were damaged or snapped.[4] As the tornado crossed Bobtown Road, it rapidly intensified and became violent, moving through another residential area at EF4 intensity. Many homes in this area were heavily damaged or completely destroyed, including at least one home that was flattened on Crestpoint Lane.[4][5] After crossing Kelso Lane, the tornado weakened slightly, but remained intense as it continued through residential areas at EF3 intensity. More homes were heavily damaged or destroyed with roofs removed and some to all exterior walls knocked down; some homes also had multiple interior walls knocked down. At least one home had a pickup truck thrown into it and some homes were partially swept away as well, although they were either unanchored or poorly anchored to their foundations, precluding a higher rating. The tornado then became violent again and reached EF4 intensity as it struck an apartment complex after crossing Locust Grove Road. Several single- or multi-story apartment buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with upper and lower floor walls knocked down and roofs removed. One apartment building was completely flattened, a storage facility next to the complex was completely destroyed, and trees and power poles were snapped.[5][4] All the apartment buildings left standing after the tornado struck were later condemned and torn down.[6] The tornado then became deadly as it struck the I-30 and President George Bush Turnpike interchange. It tossed several vehicles and towed trailers off the elevated bridge ramps and into the traffic below. Nine people, including a one-year-old, were killed in this area.[5][3][7][8][9] It also knocked down highway signs, bent and destroyed at least one large light pole that illuminated the interchange, and snapped trees. The tornado was rapidly weakening as it crossed through the interchange and it struck another RV park at EF1 intensity after crossing it, damaging trees and RVs in the area.[4] Beyond the RV park, the tornado continued northeastward and moved over Lake Ray Hubbard; because it struck no damage indicators on the lake, this segment was rated EF0. Upon coming ashore in the eastern part of Rowlett, the tornado reached EF3 intensity as it struck another neighborhood. Homes suffered extensive damage with roofs partially to completely removed and exterior walls knocked down. At least one home was completely flattened, at least one car was flipped, and trees were damaged or snapped.[4] The tornado then continued northeastward through residential areas at EF2 intensity, continuing to partially to completely unroof and knock down the exterior walls of homes with other suffering moderate roof damage, and snapping trees and power poles.[4] The tornado then regained EF3 intensity again on Channel Drive, where a home was mostly destroyed, a car was flipped, and more trees were snapped.[5][4] The tornado retained EF3 intensity as it continued northeastward, heavily damaging or destroying more homes, including some that were flattened and snapping or uprooting trees. It also struck a mobile home park, rolling and destroying multiple mobile homes.[4] An elderly man would die in Rowlett after his home collapsed on him. The tornado then began a rapid weakening trend after it crossed Lake Bend Drive and approached SH-66, dropping to EF0 intensity by the time it reached and crossed SH-66 as it moved into Rockwall County. The tornado continued to cause EF0 damage before moving back out over Lake Ray Hubbard. The tornado then narrowed and dissipated over the lake at 7:02 pm CST, ending its 13.04\u00a0mi-journey (20.99\u00a0km). The tornado was on the ground for 13 minutes and had a peak width of 550 yards (500\u00a0m).[1] In all, 10 people were killed, 468 others were injured, and the damage caused was estimated to be $20-26 million (2015 USD).[5][3][1][7][10][11]"

The ages of the victims here ranged from 1 to 77 years of age. One 77-year-old male was also killed in Rowlett while sheltering in a home.[1] In 2023, tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis unofficially rated the tornado EF3 and stated the maximum width of the tornado was 400 yards (370\u00a0m).[14]"

It was founded by a group of colonists led by Domingo Urias, Irineo Casillas Arevalo, and his wife Maximina Espinoza. At the same time, the governor of the state was general Hip\u00f3lito Charles, who posted a military garrison in the area led by Captain Manuel Leal. In 1880, the community received villa (town)  status under its first name of Garza Gal\u00e1n. In 1884, the locality was renamed Congregaci\u00f3n las Vacas. Congregacion las Vacas was then renamed Villa Acu\u00f1a in 1912 after Saltillan poet Manuel Acu\u00f1a.  Villa Acu\u00f1a was finally given the title of city on 16 September 1951 by Don JesusMaria Ramon, when it got its present name of Ciudad Acu\u00f1a. On 24 October 1960, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Mexican President Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos met in Acu\u00f1a to sign the initial agreements allowing construction of the dam. Construction plans were not finalized until December 1966, when Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz met on the international bridge. Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz met for the dedication of Amistad Dam on 8 September 1969. Originally created to serve airmen at Laughlin AFB just across the border, \"Boys' Town\" is an entertainment district located in an area south of Ciudad Acu\u00f1a and contains a few after-hours bars and brothels, but is designated off-limits to U.S. military personnel. On 25 May 2015, an F3 tornado struck the city, causing incredible damage and killing 14 people and injuring 200 more."

Brinkley claimed to be able to cure male virility deficiency with goat gland transplants. Brinkley wanted to promote his male enhancement operations and used the radio station for that purpose.  Because of the purpose of radio XER and what it promoted, the station was closed in 1939 by the Mexican government. In 1947, the government of Mexico licensed XER, the 100\u00a0kW super-power border blaster run by Ramon D. Bosquez.  They used the old XERA facilities and sold its airtime to American evangelists broadcasting in English to the United States. In 1959, Ramon D. Bosquez and Arturo Gonzalez formed the Inter-American Radio Advertising, Inc. in Del Rio. They ran the broadcasting in Del Rio while the license rested in the hands of Mexican officials. They boosted the power to 250\u00a0kW. This super station was where disc jockey Wolfman Jack became famous between 1962 and 1964.  XERF-AM is currently under control of the Instituto Mexicano de la Radio and plays Spanish-language programs and music."

        "header": "History",
        "content": "The growth of the town of Dolo is due to the gradual downsizing of the maritime power of Venice which was historically oriented towards Dalmatia, the Aegean Sea and the Middle East, which occurred concurrently with the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic expansion and the new opening of navigation routes to the Americas. As a consequence, Venice had to address inland its new commercial interests. At the beginning of the 15th century, documents testify to the existence of a village which, developing, gave rise to the economic importance of Dolo, always linked to the presence of its water mills collecting wheat from the nearby agricultural lands and then grinding the flour and embarking some into cargo boats pulled by horses along the banks of the Brenta Canal to the lagoon, from where they continued directly up to the Venice island settlement. Drinking water, too, was carried from Dolo to the centre of Venice by cargo boats with big barrels filled directly from the springs of the little river Seriola. The territory was affected by massive hydraulic works that led to the diversion of the main bed of the river Brenta through an artificial canal with new mouths along the southern sea approaches of the port of  Chioggia, while just one part of the old  Brenta still flows into the lagoon near Fusina. The purpose of these megalithic hydraulic works was primarily to prevent the progressive flooding of the lagoon by the freshwater of the rivers and thus maintain a high degree of salinity necessary to make possible the navigation and the very existence of Venice.\nUntil 1405, the jurisdiction of Dolo was under Padua,  and then passed definitely under the dominion of Venice. A boat, called the Burchiello, transported Venetian noblemen directly to the Riviera sailing along the river Brenta, which was considered a natural extension of the Grand Canal, to spend the summer in the villas. An old marble table is still on display nearby to show toll tariffs for the transit in the locks for each type of boat coming from or going to Padua. The origin of the name Dolo is quite uncertain and controversial. One theory asserts the name comes from the contraction of \"Dandolo\", the surname of a noble Venetian family who gave a doge to the city of Venice and had properties here. From old maps, it appears that the town\u2019s name was sometimes reported as Dollo, which in archaic Italian language could also mean a tower which was probably demolished thereafter unless it refers to the church\u2019s belfry which is the highest in the region of Veneto, second only to St. Mark\u2019s belfry in Venice."

Timothy Dwight Hobart, a native of Vermont, sold plots of land for the town only to people who agreed to settle there and develop the land, and Pampa soon became a center for agriculture. Gas and oil were discovered in the Texas Panhandle in 1916. Pampa prospered greatly in the resulting oil boom, and the Gray County seat of government was moved in 1928 from Lefors to Pampa.[7][8] The Army Air Forces Training Command operated the Pampa Army Air Field that was in operation from 1942 to 1945. The former base is located near the intersection of SH 152 and FM 1474, about 10 miles east of the town."

By the mid-1990s, Lovett Library was showing its age, and not compliant with the Americans for Disabilities Act. In October 1995, it was announced that Mrs. Ruth Ann Holland has left $500,000 to the Library Foundation in her will. In 1996, the Lovett Library Foundation, which managed the Holland bequest and several other substantial bequests, announced that a plan was being made to extensive renovate the old building. In January 1998, the library staff, along with all books and much equipment, moved from the Houston Street facility to the old B. M. Baker school on the south side, where the library was set up in the cafeteria and classroom annex in the south part of the school complex. This freed the old building on Houston Street for renovation. The children's area was moved to the second floor; a bridge was built between the second floor facility and other children's rooms in the south part of the building; an elevator was installed; new shelves, lighting, and ceiling tiles were installed; and the building was made completely ADA compliant. In June 2003, it was announced that R. L. Franklin, prominent rancher of Pampa, would donate two statues to the library to honor the 50th anniversary of the opening of the building in January 1955. One statue, by Don Ray of Channing, represents a seated woman reading to a child; this is erected in front of the library. Another statue representing a Pioneer Woman was by David Frech of New York was placed in the library's Reading Garden. Both statues were dedicated to four local women, including the donor's mother, each of whom had a long involvement with the library. The statues were dedicated on January 9, 2005, and at one of the dedicatory events, author Elmer Kelton was the guest speaker."

The tornado was part of a small outbreak of seven tornadoes that formed across Europe that day."

        "content": "The tornado first touched down just east of B\u0159eclav, initially moving over open fields before continuing east and reaching F2 strength as some metal truss transmission towers were knocked over, and cars were blown off roadways into safety barriers. An area of F3-level tree damage occurred farther to the northeast, where a stand of large trees were denuded and mowed down. The tornado reached its peak width of 2.8 kilometers (1.7 mi) in this area. It then narrowed slightly and continued producing F3 damage to trees it moved to the east-northeast towards Hru\u0161ky. A small industrial complex was impacted in this area, and two brick buildings were significantly damaged, with the damage at that location being rated F2. The large and intense tornado then struck Hru\u0161ky directly at F3 intensity, resulting in widespread, major structural damage throughout the southern half of the town. Numerous well-built brick homes had their roofs torn off, some of which sustained collapse of exterior walls, and a school building and a church were also severely damaged. Several cars were tossed against houses and into gardens, and a metal shipping container was thrown and wrapped around a large iron gate post. A 7-tonne caravan was lofted 20 meters (65 ft) over a garage, and two multi-tonne fair attractions were displaced several meters from where they originated. Groves of trees were snapped and debarked, outbuildings were leveled, and 201 houses were damaged in Hru\u0161ky, 58 of which were destroyed. Shortly after exiting Hru\u0161ky, the tornado reached F4 intensity as it moved through a rural area, producing extreme damage to vegetation. Trees were completely stripped clean of bark and limbs in this area, and scoured grass and crops from nearby fields was left plastered against the trunks. Weakening back to F3 intensity, the tornado impacted a nearby cattle facility. Roofing was torn off, walls were collapsed, livestock was killed, and concrete roof and wall slabs were ripped from the large farm building and scattered into fields at this location. Nearby industrial and agricultural buildings were also severely damaged or destroyed, while trailers, tractors, and large concrete blocks from a hay storage structure were thrown as well.[14] Continuing at F3 strength, the large and powerful tornado struck Moravsk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves, inflicting major structural damage to hundreds of well-built brick homes, apartment buildings, and businesses, dozens of which had roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed. A pub and two boarding houses were destroyed in Moravsk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves, and a large church had its roof torn off. The church's clock tower was also damaged, and the clock itself was stopped at 7:25 PM, the time the tornado struck the town. Multiple vehicles were flipped, large trees were snapped and denuded, and streets in town were blocked by structural debris and downed power lines following the tornado. A total of 369 buildings were damaged in Moravsk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves, 31 of which were destroyed. The tornado narrowed further but reached peak strength as it ripped directly through the neighboring town of Mikul\u010dice, leaving widespread destruction and several areas of violent F4 damage. Multiple well-built brick and masonry homes had F4-level structural damage, some of which sustained collapse of thick load-bearing walls, and a few were partially to completely leveled. At one location at the west edge of town, three adjacent masonry homes were completely destroyed at F4 intensity, one of which was flattened with no walls left standing. Several inches of topsoil was scoured from a nearby farm field, and debris from destroyed structures was strewn long distances. Numerous homes and several businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed in the central part of town, including a brick house that was leveled to the ground and had two cars tossed on top of the remaining pile of rubble.[15] Some other homes in this area were left with only a few walls standing, and gravestones were cracked and broken at a cemetery. The exterior walls of structures that remained standing were scarred and impaled by pieces of debris, and streets were left strewn with bricks and lumber. Some of the most violent damage occurred in the eastern part of town, where multiple very well-built masonry homes were largely destroyed, and trees sustained severe debarking, some of which were completely stripped clean of all bark. An occupied passenger bus in this area was thrown over a small hill into a brick home that was destroyed, severely injuring multiple passengers. Major damage also occurred along the railroad tracks, where multiple overhead lines and pylons were toppled, several industrial buildings were destroyed, and heavy concrete slabs were displaced and moved several meters. Railroad signals were also destroyed, and sound canceling barriers were torn apart with their debris scattered across a wide area. Multiple vehicles were thrown and mangled in the Mikul\u010dice area, and one car was lofted 200 meters (656 ft) through the air into an open field at a vineyard, where it was found with its engine block torn out and missing. The engine block was later found 150 meters (492 ft) away from where the car was located, thrown in the opposite direction of the movement of the tornado. Iron wiring used to secure grape vines at the vineyard was found twisted around trees, and several brick wine storage buildings were damaged or collapsed. A total of 300 homes were damaged in Mikul\u010dice, 62 of which were destroyed.[16][9][8][17] Continuing into Lu\u017eice, the tornado became narrower but continued to produce a path of very intense damage. A majority of the damage in Lu\u017eice was rated F3, though a small area of F4 damage was noted in the southern part of town, where two very well-built brick homes sustained major structural damage, including collapse of multiple thick masonry walls. Multiple other homes and apartment buildings were damaged or destroyed, trees were debarked, large industrial buildings and factories sustained major structural damage, streets were left covered with debris, and severed gas and electrical lines sparked multiple small fires in the wake of the tornado. Numerous cars were thrown and piled against one metal-framed industrial building that was heavily damaged in town, and a smaller masonry structure was completely destroyed, though it was not well-constructed enough to warrant a rating higher than F3. The tornado continued through the northeastern part of Lu\u017eice at F3 strength, where several vineyards and gardens sustained extensive damage, and some smaller wooden and brick structures were destroyed. Trees were snapped and denuded, and multiple houses were destroyed near Lake Lu\u017e\u00e1k. A total of 100 homes were damaged in Lu\u017eice, 17 of which were destroyed. After exiting Lu\u017eice, the tornado remained narrow and weakened to F2 strength, but still proceeded to cut a path of extensive damage through the northern part of neighboring Hodon\u00edn. Multiple large apartment buildings, office buildings, businesses, and houses sustained significant damage. Several other buildings, including a retirement home, a sports complex, an arena, and structures at the Hodon\u00edn Zoo were also severely damaged. A few metal buildings were destroyed, along with numerous solar panels at a solar energy facility. Cars were flipped in parking lots, debris from impacted structures was found speared into the ground, and many small sheds and cottages were obliterated at a large allotment garden. Many trees and power lines were downed, and hundreds of structures were damaged in Hodon\u00edn, some of which were destroyed. The strong tornado widened again and curved northward as it exited Hodon\u00edn and moved into a rural area, completely mowing down a large swath of trees as it impacted a patch of forest. Metal truss transmission towers were blown over in this area, crops were damaged in farm fields, and damage along this segment of the path was rated F2. The tornado briefly strengthened again one final time as it struck the village of P\u00e1nov at high-end F3 strength. Almost every structure in the small village was damaged in some way, and multiple homes were significantly damaged or destroyed, a few of which were leveled. Outbuildings were destroyed, cars were damaged by flying debris, and large trees were snapped and denuded as well. The tornado continued past P\u00e1nov and moved through another densely forested area, weakening back to F2 strength as it flattened another large swath of trees. The tornado continued to weaken, and trees beyond this point were downed at F1 intensity as the tornado continued to the northeast before it abruptly dissipated near Rat\u00ed\u0161kovice. In all, at least 1,200 buildings were damaged or destroyed by the tornado along its 27.1 kilometer (17 mi)-long path. 6 people were killed by the tornado, and at least 200 more were injured, some critically.[18][19]"

Damages to privately owned properties are expected to be many times higher, but the exact numbers are still unknown.[23] Shortly after the tornado, workers started to fix homes that were not damaged beyond repair. Streets of impacted villages were filled with piles of debris and destroyed vehicles. The governor of South Moravia, Jan Grolich, stressed the need to clean them, and artificial landfills were made for cleaned up debris. Some of it will be used to aid house repairs.[23] A delegation of the Vietnamese Embassy and the Vietnamese Association in the Czech Republic visited several Vietnamese households to help support and comfort them. A fundraising campaign was launched by the delegation to aid those affected. More than 200,000 CZK (~$9,300) was raised in a day for essential goods. Over 30 Vietnamese families were affected, according to the association.[24] Hodon\u00edn-born entrepreneur and philanthropist Karel Kom\u00e1rek pledged an immediate donation of 150 million CZK to help the recovery effort.[25] \"I was born in Hodon\u00edn and this disaster has deeply affected me. We have to act quickly, which is why we immediately set aside funds to help with the recovery effort and to give people back their livelihoods,\" said Kom\u00e1rek after he announced his donation.[26] He also said he would make more funds available, should the situation require it.[27] Ice hockey player Michal Kempn\u00fd, a native of Hodon\u00edn, helped to rebuild his hometown after the tornado.[28] The NCSML requested direct financial assistance to help impacted areas. The CEO, Dr. Cecilia Rokusek called the tornado the \"most devastating storm ever in the country\", and that assistance is \"essential for preserving our rich history for the long term future\".[29]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Bill was a tropical storm that affected the Gulf Coast of the United States in the summer of 2003. The second storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season, Bill developed from a tropical wave on June 29 to the north of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It slowly organized as it moved northward, and reached a peak of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) shortly before making landfall in south-central Louisiana. Bill quickly weakened over land, and as it accelerated to the northeast, moisture from the storm, combined with cold air from an approaching cold front, produced an outbreak of 34\u00a0tornadoes. Bill became extratropical on July 2, and was absorbed by the cold front later that day. Upon making landfall on Louisiana, the storm produced a moderate storm surge, causing tidal flooding. In a city in the northeastern portion of the state, the surge breached a levee, which flooded many homes in the town. Moderate winds combined with wet soil knocked down trees, which then hit a few houses and power lines, and left hundreds of thousands without electric power. Two people drowned from rough surf in Florida. Further inland, tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage. Throughout its path, Tropical Storm Bill caused around $50\u00a0million in damage (2003\u00a0USD) and four deaths."

        "content": "A tropical wave developed scattered convection in the central Caribbean Sea on June 24, while interacting with an upper-level low. It moved slowly northwestward,[1] and remained disorganized due to strong upper level wind shear.[2] Late on June 27, the convection became slightly better organized around a broad low pressure area, though land interaction prevented further development as it moved towards the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[3] The area of low pressure became better defined over the central Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and after the system turned to the northwest, convection quickly organized while located over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. On June 29, following the development of a closed circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 40 miles (64\u00a0km) north of Progreso, Yucat\u00e1n.[4] The depression quickly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Bill later on June 29. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until it attained tropical storm status.[4] Initially, the system resembled a subtropical cyclone, with the strongest winds and deep convection located far from the center, though it was classified tropical due to its tropical origins.[5] The storm steadily intensified as wind shear decreased,[4] and early forecasts from the National Hurricane Center mentioned the possibility of Bill intensifying to hurricane status if the low level circulation organized beneath the area of deepest convection. Bill turned to the north-northwest, and later to the north, as it moved around the periphery of a ridge of high pressure.[6] On June 30, Tropical Storm Bill reached a peak intensity of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h), one hour before making landfall in southwestern Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. It moved onshore at peak intensity, and quickly weakened to a depression over land as it accelerated to the northeast. Bill remained a tropical cyclone as it moved through the southeast United States,[4] until it became attached to an approaching cold front on July 2 near the Tennessee\u2013Virginia border.[7] The remnant extratropical storm was absorbed by the cold front on July 3 near central Virginia,[4] while the remnant low pressure area continued northeastward until reaching the Atlantic Ocean later on July 3.[8]"

        "content": "Shortly after the storm formed, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch from the southern end of Galveston Island to Morgan City, Louisiana. As a more northward motion occurred, the watch was canceled and replaced with a tropical storm warning from High Island, Texas, to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Shortly before the storm made landfall, the warning was discontinued between High Island and Cameron, Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center briefly issued a hurricane watch from Intracoastal City to Morgan City, but it was discontinued when Tropical Storm Bill failed to strengthen.[4] Prior the storm making landfall, local National Weather Service offices issued flash flood watches and a tornado watch for large portions of the Gulf Coast.[9] The threat of Tropical Storm Bill caused 41\u00a0oil platforms and 11\u00a0oil rigs to evacuate. This resulted in a loss of production of over 71 thousand barrels (11,300\u00a0m3) of oil and 610\u00a0million cubic feet (17,000,000\u00a0m3) of gas.[10] The American Red Cross mobilized workers and brought food, water, and other supplies to Louisiana prior to the storm's arrival. At the request of Louisiana emergency management officials, the organization opened two shelters for residents in low-lying areas. Several floodgates in New Orleans were closed before the storm made landfall, and many universities and government offices were closed as well. Parishes along the coastline closed summer camps and prepared sand bags, boats, and high-wheeled vehicles.[9] Officials declared a voluntary evacuation for Grand Isle, though few residents heeded the recommendation.[11] Louisiana Governor Mike Foster declared a statewide state of emergency to easily make state resources available, and Mississippi Governor Ronnie Musgrove made a similar declaration for Harrison, Hancock, and Jackson Counties, where shelters were also opened.[12] Officials in Mississippi ordered the evacuation of flood-prone areas in anticipation for a moderate storm surge and above-normal tides.[9]"

Damage estimates totaled to over $50\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $82.8\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD), primarily as a result of flooding or tornadic damage. Throughout its path, Bill spawned 34 tornadoes, ranking it fourteenth in the list of North Atlantic hurricanes generating the most tornadoes.[13] The tornado outbreak was caused by wind shear, moist air from the storm, and cool air from an approaching cold front.[14] In spite of the large numbers of tornadoes, most were weak and short-lived.[15] Prior to forming, the storm produced rainfall along coastal areas of Mexico along the Bay of Campeche, peaking at nearly 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) in Yucat\u00e1n, and over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) in Campeche.[16]"

Sustained winds from the storm remained weak, and peak wind gusts were 20 miles per hour (32\u00a0km/h) in eastern Galveston County. Upon making landfall, Bill caused a storm surge of up to 3.81 feet (1.16\u00a0m) at Pleasure Pier. Effects in Texas were minimal, limited to minor beach erosion on the Bolivar Peninsula.[17] A moderate storm surge accompanied Tropical Storm Bill as it made landfall on Louisiana. In the state, the maximum reported surge was 5.8 feet (1.8\u00a0m), and it occurred at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium facility in Chauvin.[18] In Montegut, the surge breached a levee which was still damaged from the effects of Hurricane Lili 9\u00a0months before. The breach flooded many homes in the town,[19] forcing the evacuation of an entire neighborhood.[20] As a result, 150\u00a0homes in the town were damaged, with half of them severely.[21] The storm surge affected numerous low-lying cities in southeastern Louisiana by flooding roadways,[19] including the only road to Grand Isle, stranding residents and visitors. The road was opened a day after the storm as floodwaters receded.[22] The floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in St. Tammany Parish. Damage from the storm surge totaled $4.1\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD).[19] Rough waves sank two boats offshore; their occupants were rescued.[22] The tornado outbreak associated with the storm began with an F0 in St. Bernard Parish that destroyed a boat house.[23] A short-lived F1 tornado touched down in Reserve, striking a private high school, where it destroyed half of one classroom and damaged several others. Later, the F1 tornado passed through a trailer park and severely damaged or destroyed 20\u00a0trailers. One trailer with a woman and three children was lifted into the air and dropped 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) away; four occupants were injured, none of them seriously. Damage from the tornado amounted to $2\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $3.31\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[24] A third tornado, rated an F0, struck Orleans Parish, damaging a car and a portion of a roof.[25] Winds of 35\u00a0to 45\u00a0mph (56\u201372\u00a0km/h) were common across southeastern Louisiana, with the highest sustained wind being 53 miles per hour (85\u00a0km/h) in Chauvin and a peak gust of 62 miles per hour (100\u00a0km/h) on the northern end of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.[18] The winds knocked trees and tree branches into power lines,[26] leaving 224,000\u00a0residents without power.[22] The storm dropped moderate to heavy amounts of precipitation, peaking at 10.2 inches (260\u00a0mm) at a location 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) south of Folsom.[27] The rainfall led to flash flooding, which inundated roads and cars and overwhelmed local drainage capacities.[28] The rainfall also led to overflown rivers and creeks, resulting in flooding along the Tangipahoa River in southern Tangipahoa Parish, and the Bogue Falaya and Tchefuncte River in St. Tammany Parish.[29] The Bogue Falaya River crested at 57 feet (17\u00a0m) on July 1, 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) above flood stage, which became a record for the recording station.[26] The flooding damaged several structures and roadways. Less severe river flooding occurred in Washington and Livingston Parishes.[29] In all, damage in Louisiana totaled to $44\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $72.9\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[18]"

Tropical Storm Bill dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 9.49 inches (241\u00a0mm) in Van Cleave.[30] The moderate wind gusts, along with the saturated ground, downed trees in several locations. 34\u00a0roads in Pike and Walthall Counties were blocked by fallen trees, and two homes were damaged.[32] Additionally, power outages were reported near the coast.[4] The rainfall flooded streets in various portions of the state[33][34] and led to overflown rivers.[30] An overflown creek in Pearl River County flooded structures and roadways.[35] The outer rainbands of Bill produced a weak tornado that touched down briefly in Waveland, blowing down several trees which resulted in minor damage to roofs.[36] Statewide damage accrued to $5\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $8.28\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD), primarily from flooding.[30] As Tropical Storm Bill made landfall on Louisiana, its effects were felt in the Alabama coast as well, as heavy surf and tidal flooding pounded the coastline of the state. High waters closed a road to Dauphin Island and portions of a road along Mobile Bay.[37] Bill dropped over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) of rain across the southern half of Alabama,[38] with isolated locations receiving over 8 inches (200\u00a0mm). Due to wet conditions for months preceding the storm, rainfall from Bill led to flash flooding in many counties. The deluge led to overflown rivers and streams, and left several roadways temporarily impassable from high floodwaters. Saturated grounds and wind gusts of 30\u00a0to 35\u00a0mph (48\u201356\u00a0km/h) downed numerous trees. Many downed trees landed on power lines, which caused power outages for around 19,000\u00a0people. One downed tree destroyed a car, and another damaged a roof of a house. In Lee County, a man was required to be rescued after driving through high flood waters.[39] Roadway flooding resulted in a few minor traffic accidents.[9] Also, the outer bands of the storm spawned an F1 tornado in Crenshaw County. Early in its path, it was narrow, and damage was limited to downed trees, two destroyed sheds, and a few houses experiencing light shingle damage or damage from fallen trees. Later, it expanded to reach a width of 1,800 feet (550\u00a0m) as it moved northwestward. The tornado destroyed the roofs of two houses, one of which experienced damage to its walls. The tornado dissipated eight minutes after its 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) path began, resulting in $200,000 in damage (2003\u00a0USD, $331,259 2024\u00a0USD) and only slight injuries[40] A second tornado, rated F0 in the Fujita scale, occurred in southwestern Montgomery County. A small tornado with a width of only 180 feet (55\u00a0m), it moved to the northwest and tore down a few trees that fell onto a mobile home, a house, and two cars. The tornado dissipated six minutes after its 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) path began.[41] Throughout Alabama, Tropical Storm Bill caused around $300,000 in damage (2003\u00a0USD, $496,889 2024\u00a0USD).[39][40][41] Rainfall from the storm began affecting Florida a few days before the storm formed, and locations in the southern portion of the state received over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) of rain.[38] Along the Florida Panhandle, Bill dropped over 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rain as it made landfall,[42] closing several roads[43] or leaving them impassable due to flooding.[42] A stationary line of thunderstorms in Okaloosa County produced downpours of up to 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) in one hour, resulting in flash flooding which washed out a portion of a bridge.[44] In Bay County, heavy rainfall and flooding damaged 40\u00a0homes, while several residents in an apartment in Parker needed to be rescued by boat from the floodwaters.[45] Rough surf produced by the storm killed two swimmers at Panama City Beach, while a dozen had to be rescued.[46] Part of the tornado outbreak spawned by the storm extended into northern Florida.[47] Damage in Florida totaled to around $1\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $1.66\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[44][45]"

Areas in southeastern Georgia received generally around 1 inch (25\u00a0mm); some coastal areas did not receive any precipitation from the storm.[48] Rainfall resulted in flooding in numerous locations around the Atlanta metropolitan area, leaving some roads impassable or closed.[49] The combination of moist air from the south, cool temperatures from a cold front to the north, and low pressures led to the development of supercells throughout Georgia and South Carolina, several of which produced tornadoes.[14] An F1 tornado touched down 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) north-northeast of Pennington; first it passed through a farm, causing severe damage to two dairy sheds, a John Deere tractor, and three metal storage buildings. The tornado destroyed a hay barn, a carport, and a car inside the carport as well, while also causing a tree to fall and kill one cow.[50] The tornado passed through a forested area, where it toppled or sheared off hundreds of trees. As it entered a more urban area, it downed 30\u00a0isolated trees, some of which fell on a portion of Interstate 20, temporarily closing the roadway.[51] The tornado damaged seven houses, primarily to roof damage, although one experienced damage to several windows, while another had a utility trailer and a car damaged by fallen trees; a commercial building was damaged as well.[50] An F2 tornado was reported in Clito, which knocked down trees and damaged mobile homes.[52] Severe thunderstorms from the remnants of Bill caused considerable damage to a house near Louisville and knocked down several trees. Moreover, a tornado was briefly associated with the storms.[53] Bill also caused thunderstorms in Kite which uprooted several trees onto a car and a house.[54] One man in Atlanta died due to a falling tree.[4] Damage in Georgia totaled to $244,500 (2003\u00a0USD, $404,964 2024\u00a0USD).[50][53][54] The tornado outbreak spawned by Bill was the greatest in the Charleston, South Carolina National Weather Service area since the outbreak provoked by Hurricane Earl in 1998. One such tornado was an F1 that struck Hampton,[14] which uprooted trees and downed power lines. The tornado severely damaged a Dollar General store, while several houses were damaged from fallen trees.[55] An F1 tornado also touched down near Smoaks, which uprooted several trees, resulted in a crushed car due to a fallen tree, caused severe roof damage to a mobile home, and killed one dog.[56] The storm produced heavy rainfall in the northern portion of the state, with some locations reporting over 7 inches (180\u00a0mm).[38] The rainfall resulted in flash flooding in areas, which caused some damage.[57] In North Carolina, the remnants of the storm dropped around 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) in the east-central part of the state, while the southwestern portion of the state received totals of over 7 inches (180\u00a0mm).[38] In Raleigh, a boy drowned from the floodwaters.[4] The tornado outbreak from the storm extended into North Carolina, though specifics are unknown.[47] Bill produced light to moderate precipitation in the Mid-Atlantic, including over 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) in central Virginia.[38] In Virginia, a line of thunderstorms from the system produced small amounts of hail in Falls Church.[58] The tornado outbreak associated with Bill ended in New Jersey;[47] a narrow F0 tornado briefly touched down in a marsh near Goshen. The tornado remained away from the city, and caused no damage or injuries.[59]"

The last storm of the 2001 Pacific typhoon season, Vamei developed on 26 December at 1.4\u00b0\u00a0N in the South China Sea. It strengthened quickly and made landfall along extreme southeastern Peninsular Malaysia. Vamei rapidly weakened into a remnant low over Sumatra on 28 December, and the remnants eventually re-organized in the North Indian Ocean. Afterward, the storm encountered strong wind shear once again, and dissipated on 1 January 2002. Though Vamei was officially designated as a tropical storm, its intensity is disputed; some agencies classify it as a typhoon, based on sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and the appearance of an eye. The storm brought flooding and landslides to eastern Peninsular Malaysia, causing $3.58\u00a0million in damage (2001\u00a0USD, $6.16\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) and five deaths."

        "content": "On 19 December, a small low-level circulation was located along the northwest coastline of Borneo; at the same time a plume of cold air progressed southward through the South China Sea on the southeastern periphery of a ridge over the Far East. The vortex drifted southwestward, reaching open water by 21 December. The northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation, and at the same time a portion of the air surge crossed the equator. The southerly flow turned eastward, then northward, and in combination with the northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex, resulting in rapid development of the low-level circulation, just a short distance north of the equator.[1] By 25 December, an area of scattered convection persisted about 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) east of Singapore within an area of low wind shear, in association with the low-level circulation. Continuing slowly westward, the convection deepened and organized further,[2] and at 12:00\u00a0UTC on 26 December the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) east of Singapore, or 156\u00a0km (97\u00a0mi) north of the equator.[3] This was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near the equator.[1] The depression strengthened further and officially attained tropical storm status at 00:00\u00a0UTC on 27 December, based on the analysis by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA),[3] though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior. Shortly thereafter, an eye with a 39\u00a0km (24\u00a0mi) diameter became apparent on satellite imagery, along with rainbands extending southward to the opposite side of the equator. At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the JMA first classified the system as Tropical Storm Vamei, about 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) northeast of Singapore,[2] and the agency estimated the storm attained peak winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) at the same time.[3] However, the JTWC upgraded Vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph),[nb 1] based on a United States Navy ship report from within the eye; a second ship reported wind gusts of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) in the southern portion of the eyewall. The storm was small and compact, with gales extending about 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) from its center. At about 0830\u00a0UTC on 27 December, Vamei made landfall approximately 60\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) northeast of Singapore,[2] in the southeastern portion of the Malaysian state of Johor.[4] Initially, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) classified the cyclone as a tropical storm,[5] though it was later re-assessed as a typhoon at landfall.[6] Vamei weakened quickly as it crossed the extreme southern portion of the Malay Peninsula, and late on 27 December, the JMA downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the Straits of Malacca.[3] The JTWC initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm, though the agency downgraded the storm to depression status as the storm's center again approached land.[2] Early on 28 December, Vamei moved ashore on northeastern Sumatra, and at 06:00\u00a0UTC, the JMA classified the storm as dissipated.[3] However, convection persisted near the circulation over land, believed to have been caused by the process known as upper-level diffluence. On 29 December, what was originally believed to be a separate system reached the southeastern Bay of Bengal. In a post-season re-evaluation, the JTWC classified the system as a continuation of Vamei, based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of Vamei crossed Sumatra without dissipating. Convection re-developed, and late on 30 December, the JTWC classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390\u00a0km (240\u00a0mi) west-southwest of the northwestern tip of Sumatra; initially, due to being treated as a separate system, it was classified as Tropical Cyclone\u00a005B. Vamei quickly developed good outflow and organization, though increased wind shear on 31 December rapidly weakened the storm; by late that day, the center was exposed, and Vamei quickly dissipated on 1 January 2002.[2]"

Often, the vortex remains near the coastline, and in an analysis of 51\u00a0winters, only six reported the vortex as being over the equatorial waters for four days or more. As the area in the South China Sea between Borneo and Singapore is only 665\u00a0km (413\u00a0mi) wide, a vortex needs to move slowly to develop. A persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days, which is needed to enhance the vortex, is present, on average, nine days each winter. The probability for a pre-existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10 and 30\u00a0percent. Thus, the conditions which resulted in the formation of Vamei are believed to occur once every 100\u2013400\u00a0years.[1]"

Additionally, monsoonal moisture, influenced by the storm, produced moderate to heavy precipitation across various regions of peninsular Malaysia.[4] The passage of the cyclone resulted in flooding and mudslides, which forced the evacuation of more than 13,195\u00a0people in Johor and Pahang states into 69\u00a0shelters.[9][10] Along Gunung Pulai, the rainfall caused a landslide which destroyed four houses and killed five people. River flooding was also reported, as a result of the precipitation from Vamei as well as previous rainfall. Damage from the flooding was estimated at RM13.7\u00a0million (2001\u00a0MYR, $3.58\u00a0million 2001\u00a0USD). About 40\u00a0percent of the damage occurred to crops at a farm in Kota Tinggi.

Surrounding states were also affected to a lesser extent. The fires were triggered by a combination of record-high temperatures, drought, and high winds in the region. The situation was exacerbated, at least in Texas, by plentiful rains in recent years. The rains encouraged vegetation growth, which then dried out over the winter drought leaving more potential fuel. The unusually dry conditions have been attributed to La Ni\u00f1a.[1] At Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, only 0.36 inches (9.1\u00a0mm) of rain fell in the first two months of the year.[2] On January 1, fires continued to develop throughout the two states. By January 3, many of the fires were reported to be under control; but outbreaks continued through January, February, and March. In Texas, 12 people were killed.[3] Eight Texas towns were evacuated in March 2006.[4] From December 26, 2005, to April 3, 2006, Texas suffered 11,048 wildfires which burned 4,903,851 acres (19,845\u00a0km2) and destroyed 423 homes.[5] In Oklahoma, 869 homes were damaged; 300 of them were destroyed.[6] As of April 5, 2006, there had been over 22,564 wildfires across the country in the year to date, burning 1,872,701 acres (7,579\u00a0km2).[7] Texas governor Rick Perry declared the entire state a disaster area, describing it as a \"tinderbox\", and called for firefighters and fire equipment to combat the blazes.[8] In addition, the governor of Oklahoma, Brad Henry, declared a disaster and pleaded for federal aid. On January 10, President Bush declared several Oklahoma counties to be disaster areas; the list was amended to include 26 counties by late March. Heavy rains in late March promised at least temporary relief to the affected areas. Governor Henry lifted the burn ban (which had been instated in November) throughout Oklahoma on March 22, but reinstated it for most counties only five days later, on March 27.[9] Much of Texas was also placed under a burn ban."

The town was founded seven years before the typhoon struck.[2] Haiphong, being a low-lying port town, was devastated both physically and economically. Its geography only worsened the damage. With the high waves and winds, rice fields were flooded, buildings were decimated (and, as a result, people either were drowned or left stranded), trees were ripped up, etc. By the time the typhoon passed, most of the town was wiped out.[3] Then, due to the inability to operate as a port town, Haiphong's economy also took impact.[2] The typhoon killed about 3,000\u00a0people in Haiphong, Vietnam. There were erroneous reports that the typhoon was the third-deadliest tropical cyclone on record with a death toll of 300,000, but this was likely due to mixing the death toll with the damage total, as the city only had a population of 18,480 in 1897.[5][6]"

It would take another 143 years for a typhoon like this to happen again - Typhoon Yagi in 2024 made landfall near Haiphong and wreaked havoc on the city. The Vietnamese government has also taken action in case of another severe typhoon hitting the area. Haiphong now has a flood defense system including dykes/levees (though not all of them are firm), a flood warning service provided by Vietnam's Meteorological Service, and evacuation plans. However, Haiphong still serves as a port (and a major one today), so any large storms will harm the economy.[3]"

The third tropical cyclone of the annual season, it developed from a tropical disturbance in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a022. Gradual strengthening occurred, with the depression becoming Tropical Storm Candy on the following day. The storm reached its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) later that day and made landfall Port Aransas, Texas on June\u00a023. Candy weakened into a tropical depression only hours after moving inland. However, the system remained a designated cyclone until June\u00a026, at which time it completed extratropical transition over the state of Michigan. Due to rainfall from a trough for several days, combined 11 inches (280\u00a0mm) in some areas from Candy itself, flooding occurred in eastern Texas; there was minor damage to crops, roads, and bridges. Agricultural losses alone were slightly less than $2\u00a0million (1968\u00a0USD). Storm surge along the coast of Texas caused \"cuts\" on Padre Island. The storm spawned 24\u00a0tornadoes, though only one caused significant impact. Candy and its remnants dropped rainfall in 24\u00a0other states, reaching as far north as New Hampshire. Overall, the system caused $2.7\u00a0million in damage and no fatalities."

By June\u00a022, the system developed into a tropical depression just off the coast of Mexico in the Bay of Campeche.[1] The depression, which initially had an elongated structure,[2] moved north to north-northwestward at roughly 23\u00a0mph (37\u00a0km/h).[3] On June\u00a022, three separate and distinct circulation centers were noted in weather radar images from Brownsville, Texas.[1] Later that afternoon, a United States Navy reconnaissance aircraft investigated the depression and recorded sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,001\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg). Therefore, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Candy at 1800\u00a0UTC on that same day.[3] Late on June\u00a023, Candy made landfall near Port Aransas, Texas. Despite moving ashore, Candy attained its peak intensity at 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a024, with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg).[3] Both were observations from a weather station in Austwell, Texas.[2] The storm quickly weakened inland, falling to tropical depression status early on June\u00a024.[3] In advance of a cold front, Candy curved northeastward on June\u00a025 and began to accelerate. While moving across the Midwestern United States, the storm began to lose tropical characteristics due to the presence of cold air.[2] At 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a026, Candy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated over southern Michigan. The remnants continued eastward for several more hours before dissipating over western New York.[3]"

The peak wind gust of 71\u00a0mph (114\u00a0km/h) was measured at Port Aransas, Texas, where the storm made landfall. Storm surge was highest in San Antonio and Corpus Christi Bays, at 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m), and was 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) along the rest of the Texas coast. However, damage from the storm surge was confined to the formation of \"cuts\" along Padre Island and to coastal oil refinery equipment.[4] Prior to the formation of Candy, a trough had brought eight to ten days of rainfall throughout Texas which helped the heavy rainfall from the storm produced damage to crops, roads, and bridges throughout eastern Texas. The rains from Candy also caused flooding on many middle and upper coastal rivers with significant damage confined to the eastern and western forks of the San Jacinto River. The highest recorded rainfall was 11.28 inches (287\u00a0mm) at Point Comfort, Texas. Elsewhere in southeast Texas, precipitation amounts were generally 3 to 6 inches (76 to 152\u00a0mm).[4] Impact from winds was mostly minor, except at the 740 feet (230\u00a0m) public fishing pier in Port O'Connor, which was severely damaged by 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) winds. Ten towboats and barges, as well as several other small vessels, received minor impacts at Hopper's Landing on San Antonio Bay.[5] Outside of Texas, 2 to 4 inches (51 to 102\u00a0mm) of rain was reported in eastern Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, central Missouri, and northern Illinois.[4] Precipitation in Michigan exceeded 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) in some areas,[6] contributing to the ongoing flooding event in Ann Arbor.[7] Flash flooding was reported in western New York, due to precipitation amounts up to 3.04 inches (77\u00a0mm) in Buffalo during a 24\u2013hour period. As a result, streams overflowed their banks, inundating many basements, sewers, and underpasses.[8] While tropical, Candy spawned 19\u00a0tornadoes or funnel-clouds to form between June\u00a023 and 25. Ten were reported in Texas, five in Arkansas, three in Louisiana, and one in Missouri. Five additional tornadoes, which were associated with the extratropical remnants of Candy, were reported on June\u00a025 in eastern Ohio. Despite the amount of tornadoes, only one caused significant damage. That tornado \"nearly demolished\" a school in Morning Star, Arkansas.[4] The total property damage from the storm was \"conservatively\" estimated at $1\u00a0million, while losses to agriculture in eastern Texas approached $2\u00a0million. No deaths were reported in relation to the storm.[4]"

It takes its name from the city of Buenos Aires, the capital of the country, which used to be part of the province and the province's capital until it was federalized in 1880. Since then, in spite of bearing the same name, the province does not include Buenos Aires city, though it does include all other parts of the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The capital of the province is the city of La Plata, founded in 1882. It is bordered by the provinces of Entre R\u00edos to the northeast, Santa Fe to the north, C\u00f3rdoba to the northwest, La Pampa to the west, R\u00edo Negro to the south and west and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires to the northeast. Uruguay is just across the Rio de la Plata to the northeast, and both are on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Almost the entire province is part of the Pampas geographical region, with the extreme south often considered part of the Patagonia region. The province has a population of about 17.5 million people, which is 38% of Argentina's total population. The province covers an area of 307,571\u00a0km2 (118,754\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which is about 11% of Argentina's total area and makes it the country's largest province."

        "header": "History",
        "content": "The inhabitants of the province before the 16th-century advent of Spanish colonization were aboriginal peoples such as the Charr\u00faas and the Querand\u00edes. Their culture was lost over the next 350 years. They were subjected to Eurasian plagues from which few survived. The survivors joined other tribes or have been mostly absorbed by Argentina's European immigration. Pedro de Mendoza founded Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre in 1536. Even though the first contact with the aboriginals was peaceful, it soon became hostile. The city was evacuated in 1541. Juan de Garay re-founded the settlement in 1580 as Sant\u00edsima Trinidad y Puerto Santa Mar\u00eda de Los Buenos Aires. Amidst ongoing conflict with the aboriginals, the cattle farms extended from Buenos Aires, whose port was always the center of the economy of the territory. Following the creation of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata at the end of the 18th century, the export of meat, leather and their derivatives through the port of Buenos Aires was the basis of the economic development of the region. Jesuits unsuccessfully tried to peacefully assimilate the aboriginals into the European culture brought by the Spanish conquistadores. A certain balance was found at the end of the 18th century when the Salado River became the limit between both civilizations, despite frequent malones (aboriginal attacks on border settlements). The end to this situation came in 1879 with the Conquest of the Desert (Conquista del Desierto) in which the aboriginals were almost completely exterminated. After the independence from Spain in 1816, the city and province of Buenos Aires became the focus of an intermittent Argentine Civil War with other provinces. A Federal Pact secured by Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1831 led to the establishment of the Argentine Confederation and to his gaining the sum of public power, which provided a tenuous unity. Ongoing disputes regarding the influence of Buenos Aires, between Federalists and Unitarians, and over the Port of Buenos Aires (the prime source of public revenue at the time) fueled periodic hostilities. The province was declared independent on 11 September 1852, as the State of Buenos Aires. Concessions gained in 1859 Pact of San Jos\u00e9 de Flores and a victory at the Battle of Pav\u00f3n led to its reincorporation into the Argentine Republic on 17 December 1861. Intermittent conflicts with the nation did not truly cease until 1880, when the city of Buenos Aires was formally federalized and, thus, administratively separated from the province. La Plata was founded in 1882 by Governor Dardo Rocha for the purpose of becoming the provincial capital. The equivalent of a billion (1880s) dollars of British investment and pro-development, education and immigration policies pursued at the national level subsequently spurred dramatic economic growth. Driven by European immigration and improved health, the province's population, like Argentina's, nearly doubled to one million by 1895 and doubled again by 1914.[5] Rail lines connected nearly every town and hamlet in the province by 1914; many developed around the new railway stations. This era of accelerated development was cut short by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which caused a sharp drop in commodity prices (99% of Argentine exports were agricultural) and led to a halt in the flow of investment funds between nations. The new Concordance and Per\u00f3n governments funded ambitious lending and public works programs, visible in Buenos Aires Province through the panoply of levees, power plants, water works, paved roads, municipal buildings, and (particularly during Per\u00f3n's 1946-55 tenure) schools, clinics and massive regional hospitals. The province's population, after 1930, began to grow disproportionately quickly in the suburban areas of Buenos Aires. These suburbs had grown to include 4 million out of the province's total 7 million people in 1960.[5] Much of the area these new suburbs were developed on (particularly the poorer ones) consisted of wetlands and were prone to flooding. To address this, Governor Oscar Alende initiated the province's most important flood-control project to date, the Roggero Reservoir. Completed a decade later, in 1971, the reservoir and associated electric and water-treatment facilities encouraged still more, and more orderly, development of the Greater Buenos Aires region, which today includes around 10 million people (2\u20443 of the provincial population). It did not address worsening pollution resulting from the area's industrial growth, which had made itself evident since around 1920. This problem has been at its worst along the Reconquista River west and north of the city of Buenos Aires; over 4 million people (one in 10 Argentines) today live on the Reconquista's basin.[6] Of these, about a million still live with seriously compromised water quality, despite the province's (sometimes counterproductive) efforts to remedy the issue.[7]"

Alfons\u00edn lost the 1987 midterm elections, leading to the victory of Antonio Cafiero. From then to 2015, all governors have been Peronists. The high population of the province makes it highly influential in Argentine politics. With both ruling for two terms, the rivalry of the president Carlos Menem and governor Eduardo Duhalde dominated the Argentine politics during the nineties. A similar case took place with the president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and governor Daniel Scioli.

The province can be divided into four main climatic regions: the southwestern, drier region; the cool Atlantic region; the northern and eastern humid region, and the Delta region, with the warmest, wettest climate. The northern region has warm, humid summers, with days between 28 and 32\u00a0\u00b0C (82 and 90\u00a0\u00b0F) and nights between 16 and 20\u00a0\u00b0C (61 and 68\u00a0\u00b0F), pleasant falls, cool, drier winters with highs between 13 and 18\u00a0\u00b0C (55 and 64\u00a0\u00b0F) and nights between 2 and 5\u00a0\u00b0C (36 and 41\u00a0\u00b0F), and windy, variable springs. Heat waves may bring days with temperatures over 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00b0F), but these do not usually last very long, as cold fronts bring thunderstorms and cooler days, with night temperatures often falling down to 12\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u00a0\u00b0F). Winter cold waves may bring days with highs about 8\u00a0\u00b0C (46\u00a0\u00b0F), and lows below \u22124\u00a0\u00b0C (25\u00a0\u00b0F), with extremes down to \u22128\u00a0\u00b0C (18\u00a0\u00b0F). Snow is uncommon, but there have been accumulations on several occasions in the past. Precipitation ranges from 750 to 1,100\u00a0mm (30 to 43\u00a0in) per year. The Delta region is slightly warmer, especially at night, due to the presence of water and the northerly location. Summer nights tend to be stickier, and winters can be damp and foggy, with most nights between 4 and 8\u00a0\u00b0C (39 and 46\u00a0\u00b0F). Frost is still to be expected, but temperatures will almost never fall below \u22124\u00a0\u00b0C (25\u00a0\u00b0F), and snow has fallen only twice in the last century. Precipitation ranges from 1,000 to 1,300\u00a0mm (39 to 51\u00a0in) and falls throughout the year. The city of Buenos Aires is surrounded by a climate similar to the northern part of the province, but the city itself resembles more the Delta climate, with less frost. The southwestern region is the driest region, and it experiences a more marked differences in temperatures. Summers are often hot, between 30 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C (86 and 95\u00a0\u00b0F), but nights are usually comfortable (14 to 18\u00a0\u00b0C (57 to 64\u00a0\u00b0F)). Thunderstorms are less frequent but can be very violent in nature. Frost can make an appearance as early as March, but usually first comes in April. Winters are cool and dry, with days between 10 and 16\u00a0\u00b0C (50 and 61\u00a0\u00b0F) and nights between \u22121 and 4\u00a0\u00b0C (30 and 39\u00a0\u00b0F). Frost occurs on an almost daily basis, with temperatures below \u22126\u00a0\u00b0C (21\u00a0\u00b0F) not uncommon, and down to \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C (10\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded in some areas. Snowfall may occur every once in a while, but accumulations are usually small. Total precipitation ranges from 500 to 750\u00a0mm (20 to 30\u00a0in), with slightly rainier springs and falls. The Atlantic region sees very moderate weather: the ocean is cold (17 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C (63 to 68\u00a0\u00b0F) in the summer) and sea breezes often bring chilly weather until midsummer. The hottest months average 25 to 27\u00a0\u00b0C (77 to 81\u00a0\u00b0F) with nights between 12 and 16\u00a0\u00b0C (54 and 61\u00a0\u00b0F), providing a perfect relief for the inhabitants of the hotter interior. Fall is often rainy, and winters can be windy and chilly: temperatures average from 10 to 15\u00a0\u00b0C (50 to 59\u00a0\u00b0F), and nights from 1 to 5\u00a0\u00b0C (34 to 41\u00a0\u00b0F). There can be long periods of drizzly weather and constant temperatures of about 7\u00a0\u00b0C (45\u00a0\u00b0F). Frost is common but temperatures will rarely fall below \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C (23\u00a0\u00b0F), and snowfalls sometimes, but accumulations are only to be expected every few years. Precipitation ranges from 700 to 950\u00a0mm (28 to 37\u00a0in). The Sierras de la Ventana (up to 1,200 metres (3,900\u00a0ft)) experience cooler weather, especially at night. The geography of the province is crossed by occasional west Pampero winds. The southern Sudestada produces storms and temperature drops, most notably the Santa Rosa storm,[14] which takes place every year almost exactly on 30 August."

The INDEC estimates that the population of Buenos Aires Province was 17,541,141 on 1 July 2020,[15] a 12.26% increase since the 2010 national census. According to that census, there were 15 million inhabitants (38% of the national population), of which 12 million lived in Greater Buenos Aires and 3 million in the rest of the province. Around 33.8% of the inhabitants weren't born in the province, of whom 3,918,552 are migrants from other provinces and 758,640 were born abroad.[16] Most of its inhabitants are descendants from colonial-era settlers and immigrants from Europe who arrived within the 19th and 20th centuries, mostly Italians and Spaniards. A number of suburbs in the province are also home to a large, predominantly mestizo population that began migrating from the country's northern provinces in the mid-20th century to take advantage of growing employment opportunities. These same communities are also home to considerable numbers of more recent migrants from Paraguay and Bolivia."

The province is the nation's chief exporter, generating nearly $107 billion in exports in 2016 (37% of the nation's total).[25] Agriculture in the province is renowned around the world for its productivity. The province is Argentina's chief agricultural producer, and accounted for at least $8 billion in export earnings in 2014.[26] This sector adds about 5% to the province's highly diversified economy, however.[27] The province's ranching sector is diversified, and though cattle historically provided the main animal husbandry activity, Buenos Aires is also the top producer of sheep, pork, and chicken meat of the country. Equally important is the dairy industry. Crop harvests are the most diverse in the nation and have grown to record levels in recent decades. The most important crops include soybean, maize, wheat, sunflower and other oilseeds, like flax. More recently, premium wines have been produced in the Buenos Aires wine region in the south of the province. Manufacturing accounts for a fourth of the province's output and is about 40% of the entire nation's.[27] The industry of the province is diverse: chemical, pharmaceutical, metallurgic, motor vehicles, machinery, textiles and the food industry are the most notable. Excluding processed agricultural items, the province was responsible for over US$70 billion of industrial exports in 2016 and accounted for a third of all Argentine exports.[26][28] The province's services sector is well-diversified and differs little from national trends. The largest local bank is the public Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires. The institution, the second largest in Argentina, holds nearly a tenth of the nation's bank deposits.[29]"

Pensacola was first settled by the Spanish Empire in 1559, predating the establishment of St. Augustine by six years.[5] It is the principal city of the Pensacola Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had 511,503 residents in 2020.[6] Pensacola predated the establishment of St. Augustine by six years, and was abandoned due to a significant hurricane and not re-established until 1698.[citation needed] Pensacola is a seaport on Pensacola Bay, which is protected by the barrier island of Santa Rosa and connects to the Gulf of Mexico. A large United States Naval Air Station, the first in the United States, is located in Pensacola. It is the base of the Blue Angels flight demonstration team and the National Naval Aviation Museum. The University of West Florida is situated north of the city center. The area was originally inhabited by Muskogean-speaking peoples.[citation needed] The Pensacola people lived there at the time of European contact, and Creek people frequently visited and traded from present-day southern Alabama and Mississippi and southeast of Louisiana. Spanish explorer Trist\u00e1n de Luna founded a short-lived settlement in 1559.[7] In 1698 the Spanish established a presidio in the area, from which the modern city gradually developed. The area changed hands several times as European powers competed in North America. During Florida's British rule (1763\u20131781), fortifications were strengthened.[citation needed] It is nicknamed \"The City of Five Flags\", due to the five governments that have ruled it during its history: the flags of Spain (Castile), France, Great Britain, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America. Other nicknames include \"World's Whitest Beaches\" (due to the white sand of Florida panhandle beaches), \"Cradle of Naval Aviation\", \"Western Gate to the Sunshine State\", \"America's First Settlement\", \"Emerald Coast\", \"Redneck Riviera\", and \"P-Cola\"."

At the time of European contact, a Muskogean-speaking tribe known to the Spanish as the Pensacola, lived in the region. This name was not recorded until 1677, but the tribe appears to be the source of the name \"Pensacola\" for the bay and thence the city.[8] Creek people, also Muskogean-speaking, came regularly from present-day southern Alabama to trade, so the peoples were part of a broader regional and even continental network of relations.[9] The best-known Pensacola culture site in terms of archeology is the Bottle Creek site, a large site located 59\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) west of Pensacola north of Mobile, Alabama. This site has at least 18 large earthwork mounds, five of which are arranged around a central plaza. Its main occupation was from 1250 CE to 1550. It was a ceremonial center for the Pensacola people and a gateway to their society. This site would have had easy access by a dugout canoe, the main mode of transportation used by the Pensacola.[10]"

        "content": "The area's written recorded history begins in the 16th century, with documentation by Spanish explorers who were the first Europeans to reach the area. The expeditions of P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez in 1528 and Hernando de Soto in 1539 both visited Pensacola Bay, the latter of which documented the name \"Bay of Ochuse\".[11] In the age of sailing ships Pensacola was the busiest port on the Gulf of Mexico, having the deepest harbor on the Gulf.[12] In 1559, Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano landed with some 1,500 people on 11 ships from Veracruz, Mexico.[13][11][14][15] The expedition was to establish an outpost, ultimately called Santa Mar\u00eda de Ochuse by Luna, as a base for Spanish efforts to colonize Santa Elena (present-day Parris Island, South Carolina.) But the colony was decimated by a hurricane on September 19, 1559,[13][11][15] which killed an unknown number of sailors and colonists, sank six ships, grounded a seventh, and ruined supplies. The survivors struggled to survive, most moving inland to what is now central Alabama for several months in 1560 before returning to the coast; but in 1561, the effort was abandoned.[13][15] Some of the survivors eventually sailed to Santa Elena, but another storm struck there. Survivors made their way to Cuba and finally returned to Pensacola, where the remaining fifty at Pensacola were taken back to Veracruz. The Viceroy's advisers later concluded that northwest Florida was too dangerous to settle. They ignored it for 137 years.[13][15] In the late 17th century, the French began exploring the lower Mississippi River with the intention of colonizing the region as part of La Louisiane or New France in North America. Fearful that Spanish territory would be threatened, the Spanish founded a new settlement in western Florida. In 1698 they established a fortified town near what is now Fort Barrancas, laying the foundation for permanent European-dominated settlement of the modern city of Pensacola.[16] The Spanish built three presidios in Pensacola:[17] During the early years of settlement, a triracial creole society developed. As a fortified trading post, the Spanish had mostly men stationed here. Some married or had unions with Pensacola, Creek or African women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of mestizos and mulattos. The Spanish encouraged fugitive slaves from the Southern colonies to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to Catholicism. Most went to the area around St. Augustine,[18] but escaped slaves also reached Pensacola."

        "content": "After years of settlement, the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in 1763 as a result of an exchange following British victory over both France and Spain in the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War), and French cession of its territories in North America. The British designated Pensacola as the capital of their new colony of West Florida. From 1763, the British strengthened defenses around the mainland area of fort San Carlos de Barrancas, building the Royal Navy Redoubt. George Johnstone was appointed as the first British Governor, and in 1764 a colonial assembly was established.[19][20] The structure of the colony was modeled after the existing British colonies in America, as opposed to French Canada, which was based on a different structure. West Florida was invited to send delegates to the First Continental Congress which was convened to present colonial grievances against the British Parliament to George III, but along with several other colonies, including East Florida, they declined the invitation. Once the American War of Independence had broken out, the colonists remained overwhelmingly loyal to the Crown. In 1778 the Willing Expedition proceeded with a small force down the Mississippi, ransacking estates and plantations, until they were eventually defeated by a local militia. In the wake of this, the area received a small number of British reinforcements. British military resources were limited and Pensacola ranked fairly low on their list of priorities. For this reason only small token amounts of British military forces were ever sent to defend Pensacola. This was in contrast to colonies such as South Carolina, where large numbers of British soldiers were sent.[21] After Spain joined the American Revolution in 1779 on the side of the rebels, Spanish forces captured the city in the 1781 Siege of Pensacola, gaining control of West Florida.[14] After the war, the British officially ceded both West Florida and East Florida to Spain as part of the post-war peace settlement. In 1785 many Creek from southern Alabama and Georgia came to trade and Pensacola developed as a major trade center. It was a garrison town, predominantly males in the military or trade.[9] Americans made raids into the area, and settlers pressured the federal government to gain control of this territory."

        "content": "In the final stages of the War of 1812, American troops launched an offensive on Pensacola against the Spanish and British garrisons protecting the city, which surrendered after two days of fighting. Pensacola was conquered again by the US in 1818. In 1819, Spain and the United States negotiated the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, by which Spain recognized the American control over Florida in exchange of the American recognition of Spanish control over Texas.[14] A Spanish census of 1820 indicated 181 households in the town, with a third of mixed-blood. The people were predominantly French and Spanish Creole. Indians in the area were noted through records, travelers' accounts, and paintings of the era, including some by George Washington Sully and George Catlin. Creek women were also recorded in marriages to Spanish men, in court records or deeds.[9] In 1821, with Andrew Jackson as provisional governor, Pensacola became part of the United States.[14] The city was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1822.[1] The Creek continued to interact with European Americans and African Americans, but the dominant whites increasingly imposed their binary racial classifications: white and black (\"colored\", within which were included free people of color, including Indians). However, American Indians and mestizos were identified separately in court and Catholic church records, and as Indians in censuses up until 1840, attesting to their presence in the society. After that, the Creek were not separately identified as Indian, but the people did not disappear. Even after removal of many Seminole to Indian Territory, Indians, often of mixed-race but culturally identifying as Muskogean, lived throughout Florida.[9] St. Michael's Cemetery was established in the 18th century at a location in a south central part of the city, which developed as the Downtown area. Initially owned by the Church of St. Michael, it is now owned and managed by St. Michael's Cemetery Foundation of Pensacola, Inc.[22] Preliminary studies indicate that there are over 3,200 marked burials as well as a large number unmarked.[22] Tensions between the white community and Indians tended to increase during the Removal era. In addition, an increasing proportion of Anglo-Americans, who constituted the majority of whites by 1840, led to a hardening of racial discrimination in the area.[9] There was disapproval of white men living with women of color, which had previously been accepted. In 1853 the legislature passed a bill prohibiting Indians from living in the state, and provided for capture and removal to Indian Territory.[9] While the bill excluded mixed-Indians and those already living in white communities, they went \"underground\" to escape persecution. No Indians were listed in late 19th and early 20th century censuses for Escambia County. People of Indian descent were forced into the white or black communities by appearance, and officially, in terms of records, \"disappeared\". It was a pattern repeated in many Southern settlements. Children of white fathers and Indian mothers were not designated as Indian in the late 19th century, whereas children of blacks or mulattos were classified within the black community, related to laws during the slavery years.[9] Pensacola experienced the Civil War when in 1861 Confederate forces lost the nearby Battle of Santa Rosa Island and federal forces of the United States subsequently failed to win the Battle of Pensacola. After the fall of New Orleans in 1862 the Confederacy abandoned the city and it was occupied by the North.[23] In June, 1861, the Pensacola Guards were mustered in as a company in the 1st Florida Infantry Regiment.[24] In 1907\u20131908 there were 116 Creek in Pensacola who applied for the Eastern Cherokee enrollment, thinking that all Indians were eligible to enroll. Based on Alabama census records, most of these individuals have been found to be descendants of Creek who had migrated to the Pensacola area from southern Alabama after Indian removal of the 1830s.[9] In 1908, a citywide streetcar strike occurred in the city, this led to state militia being stationed in the city and marital law being declared.[25][26]"

Although the incorporated city limits of Pensacola are relatively small, there are numerous census designated places (CDPs) located immediately outside of the incorporated city limits that are widely considered to be Pensacola. Due to their proximity to the city limits, their mailing addresses being listed as Pensacola, and lack of independent government services apart from the City of Pensacola and Escambia County. While residents of these CDPs have rejected incorporation into the City of Pensacola in previous referendums, they largely identify as residents of Pensacola. Examples of these CDPs include Goulding, Ferry Pass, Ensley, Bellview, Myrtle Grove, Warrington, and West Pensacola.

The storm knocked 58 spans off the eastbound and westbound bridges and misaligned another 66 spans, forcing the bridge to close to traffic in both directions.[43] The surge also destroyed the fishing bridge that spanned Pensacola Bay alongside the Phillip Beale Memorial Bridge, locally known as the Three Mile Bridge.[44] Over $6 billion in damage occurred in the metro area and more than 10,000 homes were destroyed, with another 27,000 heavily damaged. 105,000 households in Northwest Florida were impacted in some way by the storm, and 4,300 businesses in the area permanently closed as a result of Hurricane Ivan.[45] NASA created a comparison image to illustrate the massive damage. This widespread destruction of property caused a temporary lack of affordable housing in the Pensacola real estate market, and Hurricane Dennis and Hurricane Katrina contributed to a general scarcity of construction labor and resources along the Gulf Coast.[45]"

The Republican government had numerous African American politicians, including several county commissioners, city aldermen, constables, state representatives, and even one African American mayor\u2014Salvador Pons. However, with the 1884 election of native Pensacolian and former Confederate general Edward Perry, a dramatic shift occurred. Perry, a Democrat who actually lost the Escambia County vote during the statewide election, acted to dissolve the Republican city government of Pensacola and in 1885 replaced this government with hand-picked successors, including railroad magnate William D. Chipley. The only African American to remain in city government was George Washington Witherspoon, a pastor with the African Methodist Episcopal Church who was previously a Republican and switched parties to the Democrats. Following Governor Perry's dissolution of the Republican government, the city remained Democratic for more than a century after the Civil War with no African Americans serving in an elected capacity for nearly a century. This changed in 1994, when Republican attorney Joe Scarborough defeated Vince Whibbs, Jr., the son of popular former Democratic mayor Vince Whibbs, in a landslide to represent Florida's 1st congressional district, which is based in Pensacola. Republicans also swept all of the area's seats in the state legislature, the majority of which were held by Democrats. Since then, Republicans have dominated every level of government, although municipal elections are officially nonpartisan."

During the war, most of the rails between Pensacola and the Alabama state line were removed to construct other railroad lines urgently needed elsewhere in the Confederacy. The line to Pensacola was not rebuilt until 1868, and was acquired by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in 1880. In 1882, the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad was completed from Pensacola to Chattahoochee, Florida, linking Pensacola with the rest of the state. This line was also acquired by the L&N. By 1928, a number of short lines built northward from Pensacola to Kimbrough, Alabama, were acquired by the Frisco Railroad, giving it access to the port of Pensacola.[78][79]  Some thirty years later, retired Frisco steam engine 1355 was donated to the city and stands in the median of Garden Street, near the site of the now-demolished Frisco passenger station.[80] Frisco passenger service to Pensacola ended in 1955, and L&N passenger service, including the streamlined Gulf Wind, ended in 1971 with the advent of Amtrak. However, from early 1993 through August 2005 Pensacola was served by the tri-weekly Amtrak Sunset Limited, but service east of New Orleans to Jacksonville and Orlando was suspended due to damage to the rail line of CSX during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[81] In the 21st century, freight service to and from Pensacola is provided by L&N successor CSX as well as Frisco successor Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway, a short line. On June 1, 2019, the newly formed Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad, a Class III railroad headquartered in Tallahassee, acquired the CSX main line from Pensacola to Baldwin, Florida, near Jacksonville, becoming the Panhandle's only east\u2013west freight hauler. A news report on the new railroad in mid-2019 noted that Amtrak indicated that the Panhandle had a \"near-zero chance\" of seeing passenger service restored.[82]  Pensacola and Tallahassee are the two largest metropolitan areas in Florida without any passenger rail service."

As the system moved over central Europe on the next day, it subsequently merged with another extratropical cyclone named Hendrik before moving across central Europe, in which it brought several destruction across the region. It then was last noted on 23 October. Gusts of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) were recorded in an area in Normandy, the highest in association with the storm. Many trees across the affected areas felled, while over half a million people lost electricity. Public establishments were also closed as a precaution to winds and flooding. Flash floods also affected the U.K. and a total of six deaths were confirmed from the system: Four in Poland, one in the United Kingdom and another in Germany.

Therefore, the Hirakud Dam Authority opened 40 gates to release the excess water from the reservoir.[9] Due to the sudden release of floodwater from the dam, 100 houses in Sambalpur located near to the river got submerged in the floodwater.[10] The water released from the dam increased the water levels and the flow rate of the Mahanadi river system. In addition to the monsoon rains, the situation of the Mahanadi, Brahmani, Baitarani River Systems and other rivers in the state worsened.[11] On 17 August 2022, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a \"Yellow Alert\" of heavy rainfall for 20 districts and an \"Orange Alert\" of very heavy rainfall for 17 districts. IMD warned the state government of a new forming depression over the Bay of Bengal and advised fishermen not to venture into the sea for fishing, as the winds were blowing at 45\u201355\u00a0km/h.[12] The low-lying districts in the Mahanadi River Basin - Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Khordha, Puri and Kendrapara - were flooded with 12 lakh Cusec of water, which flowed through these areas on the night of 19 August 2022.[13] In Jharkhand, the 16 gates of the Galudih Barrage were opened and released 6 lakh cusec of water. Due to this, excess water flowed into the Subarnarekha River and flowed further into the Northern districts of Odisha like Balasore and Mayurbhanj and flooded these areas.[14][15] Heavy rains also occurred in Bhubaneswar, causing low-lying areas of the city like Sundarpada to get submerged by the rainwater; many drains, roads and old houses were damaged.[16] Due to the floods, over 1.2 lakh hectares of cropland were destroyed or damaged, leading to huge losses for farmers.

        "content": "The origins of the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone can be traced to a weak tropical disturbance which was first noted on satellite imagery on the morning of 14\u00a0November while located roughly 520\u00a0km (320\u00a0mi) southwest of the Nicobar Islands.[nb 1][2] Traveling due west at 25\u00a0km/h (16\u00a0mph) along the southern periphery of the mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge, the disturbance steadily organized, with increased banding noted on satellite imagery. This increase in organization prompted the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to report that the disturbance had intensified into a deep depression later that morning,[nb 2][4] and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 13:10\u00a0UTC that afternoon.[nb 3] At 08:00\u00a0UTC on 15\u00a0November, the JTWC issued its first advisory on the system as satellite data indicated that the storm had continued to strengthen, with estimated one-minute sustained wind speeds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph).[2] While the system was initially developing, an upper tropospheric trough had formed over northern and central India and produced a break in the subtropical ridge. As the storm traveled towards this break in the ridge on 15\u00a0November, the mid-tropospheric anticyclone over the system weakened, reducing the storm's steering flow and causing the system to slow to a 7\u00a0km/h (4.3\u00a0mph) northwestwards movement. In addition, the divergent southwesterly flow produced by the trough resulted in the system beginning a period of rapid intensification. Early on 16\u00a0November, the system intensified into a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; an eye was observed on satellite imagery later that morning.[2] For the next two days, the tropical cyclone continued to strengthen while traveling generally towards the north-northwest. During this time period, increased organization, such as tighter banding features and a progressively more distinct eye, were observed on satellite imagery. At 10:30\u00a0UTC on 17\u00a0November, the ship Jagatswami reported winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 948\u00a0hPa (27.99\u00a0inHg) off the Indian coast.[6][7] The next evening, the JTWC estimated that the system had attained its peak intensity as a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone, with one-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph), while located roughly 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) off the coast of Andhra Pradesh.[2] Around this time, the IMD estimated that the system had three-minute sustained winds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph)\u2014which would classify the system as a modern-day super cyclonic storm\u2014and a minimum barometric pressure of 943\u00a0hPa (27.85\u00a0inHg).[4][8][9][7] As the cyclone approached the Indian coast, it accelerated to 17\u00a0km/h (11\u00a0mph) while slightly weakening from its peak intensity. The storm made landfall near Chirala, in the Prakasam district of central Andhra Pradesh, around 11:00\u00a0UTC on 19\u00a0November with one-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph). Moving northwards over flat agricultural lands, the storm weakened, with the JTWC issuing its final warning at 20:00\u00a0UTC that evening.[2] The IMD continued tracking the system, reporting that it weakened into an area of low pressure on the evening of 20\u00a0November before dissipating over southeastern Madhya Pradesh and Odisha the next evening.[6]"

Members of the Janata party, an opposing political group to the state government in place at the time, claimed that the cover up was to hide criminal negligence which resulted in tens of thousands of fatalities.[10] Following these accusations, five high-ranking government officials resigned from their positions.[11]"

On September 2, shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the low became more concentrated, and the surface circulation became better defined. Although the disturbance still lacked a well-defined center by the following morning, the continued trend of organization and the system's threat to northeastern Mexico resulted in the issuance of advisories on Potential Tropical Cyclone Seven at 09:00 UTC September 3.[2] Shortly thereafter, first-light visible satellite images indicated the presence of a well-defined center of circulation, signifying the formation of a tropical depression at 15:00 UTC.[3] The cyclone continued to become better organized, and scatterometer data from 16:00 UTC that day revealed an area of tropical storm-force winds to the west of the center. Based on this data, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Fernand at 18:00 UTC on September 3.[4] Fernand continued to quickly strengthen as it moved westward, and by 03:00 UTC on September 4, it attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), as evidenced by an NOAA Hurricane hunter aircraft investigating the system. Although the cyclone was forecast to strengthen further before reaching the Mexican coast, the effects of moderate easterly to southeasterly wind shear and the entrainment of dry air into the storm's circulation prevented further intensification.[5] By mid-day on September 4, much of the associated convection had moved inland over Mexico, and Fernand weakened slightly before making landfall on the northeastern coast of Mexico at around 15:15 UTC about 35 miles (56\u00a0km) north of La Pesca with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[6] Just hours after moving inland, the surface circulation of Fernand quickly became poorly defined, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC on September 4.[7] Weakening continued as Fernand moved further inland, and at 03:00 UTC on September 5, the cyclone dissipated over the very rugged terrain of the Sierra Madre Oriental.[8]"

In some parts of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, six months-worth of rain fell within just six hours, causing rivers and streams to overflow their banks as floodwaters inundated roads, bridges, homes and, buildings. Schools and public transportation lines across the state were closed on September 5, and over 400 schools sustained damages as a result of effects from the storm.[11] In the municipality of Garc\u00eda, a Venezuelan man died after he was swept away by floodwaters while trying to clean a sewer; two others who were with him at the time were rescued.[12] In Monterrey, a taxi driver was forced to abandon his vehicle after it sank in rapidly-rising floodwaters. A man in Monterrey who was carried away by floodwaters along the Santa Catarina river was rescued by Civil Protection workers, and sustained no major injuries, while another man and his dog who attempted to drive through floodwaters in La Huasteca also required rescue after being caught in the strong current of the floodwaters.[13] On September 7, Governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n Jaime Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n declared a state of emergency for Nuevo Le\u00f3n, further announcing that he would request funding and resources from the National Disaster Fund to aid in repairs and relief efforts.[14] Initial damage in Nuevo Le\u00f3n was estimated to be MX$7.5\u00a0billion (US$383\u00a0million). Two months later, the National Civil Protection found that the damage in Nuevo Le\u00f3n was just MX$222\u00a0million (US$11.3\u00a0million), much less than the initial estimation.[15]"

As the slow-moving depression linked with warm air from the Tasman Sea, thunderstorms began to develop over the Wimmera region on the 18th.[4] Rich Avon recorded 50mm (2\u00a0inches) from one of these whilst in the Great Divide there were reports that some areas had received as much as 100mm (4\u00a0inches) in as little as six hours. As a result of this heavy rain, many rivers rose to record or near-record levels. The Avoca River rose above the top of sheds of farmhouses near its banks, as the Hopkins and the Merri River near the coast.[5] Further east, houses at Inglewood were swamped and many buildings were wrecked by the swollen Loddon River.[6] In Donald itself, not only roads, but even footpaths were devastated as the Richardson River flooded the town to a level never seen before or since, eventually reaching normally-dry Lake Buloke. Near Geelong, four people were drowned trying to cross the flooded Barwon River at Winchelsea. The floods had a major impact upon agriculture in the region, with many crops in the Western District completely destroyed through being soaked - not only during the floods, but also before they reached their peak.[7] Large numbers of sheep in the Western District were killed because of foot-rot due to the wet ground. Unusually for floods in Australia, not only did the rivers recede rapidly but the excessively wet conditions of the autumn and winter that produced them gave way to much drier weather from September onwards so that a repeat was never remotely possible. Flooding during August 1909 also happened in South Australia, the northeast of Victoria and more northerly parts of the Murray-Darling Basin; however, these were not as unusual as those in the Wimmera and Western District."

The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a slight risk for severe weather for the Central Gulf Coast for three straight days between August\u00a029-31.[4][5][6] Numerous weak tornadoes touched down in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama during this time. One EF1\u00a0tornado caused considerable damage in Saraland, Alabama on August\u00a030, injuring three people.[7] A small slight risk was also issued in the Mid-Atlantic for the Southern Delmarva Peninsula on August\u00a031, where a confluence zone was expected to have an increasing westerly mid-level flow in response to Ida, although it was not the only influence in this area.[6] Two weak tornadoes occurred in Southwest Virginia that afternoon.[8] As Ida became extratropical and moved into the Northeastern United States on September\u00a01, a strengthening low-level jet (LLJ) along and south of a warm front coupled with a very moist atmosphere and sufficient surface heating led to a more substantial risk for tornadoes between Washington, D.C., and New York City and the SPC issued a tornado-driven enhanced risk for severe weather for this region. This included a 10% tornado risk with a 30% damaging wind risk added later on.[9] That afternoon, several supercells formed across the D.C. metropolitan area and quickly became tornadic as they moved northeast. An EF2\u00a0tornado struck Annapolis, Maryland, causing significant structural and tree damage throughout the city.[10] Another EF2\u00a0tornado caused severe damage in a residential neighborhood in Oxford, Pennsylvania.[11] Later, a large EF2\u00a0tornado struck Upper Dublin Township, Pennsylvania, severely damaging buildings, homes, and trees, killing one person and causing a few minor injuries.[11] An intense EF3\u00a0wedge tornado destroyed several homes and a dairy farm in Mullica Hill, New Jersey as well, injuring two people.[11] An EF1 tornado produced by the same storm prompted the issuance of the first ever tornado emergency the Northeast, as well as the first such alert associated with a tropical cyclone. A few other weak tornadoes also touched down later that evening and into September\u00a02 before the remnants of Ida moved offshore, ending the outbreak."

It first touched down at 6:10\u00a0p.m. EDT (22:10 UTC), east-southeast of Harrisonville, initially causing minor tree damage. Tree damage became more significant as it moved northeast into the eastern side of Cedar Grove, and dozens of trees were downed at EF1\u00a0intensity in the small community. The tornado became strong and destructive as it struck the Willow Oaks subdivision at the northeast edge of Cedar Grove, where multiple homes sustained significant structural damage on Marvin Lane. Roofs were ripped off, exterior walls were collapsed, vehicles were moved and damaged, and one home was left with only a few walls left standing, with the damage in this area being rated\u00a0EF3. The tornado then weakened momentarily as it struck a commercial farm along Route 77 at the south edge of Mullica Hill, destroying barns and storage buildings at EF1 to EF2\u00a0intensity before strengthening again and moving through a subdivision in the eastern part of town. The large tornado reached its peak intensity of mid-range\u00a0EF3 at this location as it moved over Salvatore Lane and Clems Run. Several two-story homes sustained total roof and exterior wall loss in this area, and cars were tossed around. One house was completely leveled, though it was not well-anchored and nearby trees did not sustain damage consistent with a tornado stronger than EF3\u00a0strength. Crossing US 322 past Mullica Hill, the tornado maintained its strength as it destroyed barns and silos at a large dairy farm, and completely mowed down a wide swath of large trees as it moved through a wooded area. In the worst affected area, every tree in the direct path was snapped near the base. The tornado then briefly weakened to EF1\u00a0intensity before regaining EF2\u00a0intensity as it moved into Mantua Township and passed west of Barnsboro, where many trees were downed, homes sustained roof damage, and a large commercial greenhouse was partially destroyed. Continuing to the northeast, it remained at EF2\u00a0strength as it impacted Wenonah, where garages were destroyed, a fire station was damaged, and some homes had roofs and exterior walls ripped off. The tornado then narrowed and gradually weakened, causing mostly minor damage to trees, fences, roofs and siding occurred in Woodbury Heights and Deptford before dissipating at 6:30\u00a0p.m. EDT (22:30 UTC). It traveled 12.37 miles (19.91\u00a0km) and reached a maximum path width of 400 yards (370\u00a0m). Two people were injured. This was the first F3/EF3 rated tornado in the state of New Jersey since 1990, and one of only four ever confirmed in the state.[10][51] Damages exceeded $64 million, although the official estimate from the National Centers for Environmental Information is $5 million.[52][51][53]"

It started with a powerful line of severe thunderstorms that produced widespread damaging straight-line winds and multiple embedded weak tornadoes across the state of Wisconsin. During the afternoon and evening of July 29, numerous tornadic supercells developed across portions of the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic regions, producing many tornadoes. A few of the tornadoes were strong and damaging, including an EF3\u00a0tornado that caused severe damage in the Philadelphia suburbs of Trevose and Bensalem. A motorist was killed after driving into a tree felled by straight line-winds near Ripon, Wisconsin, though no tornado-related fatalities occurred.

        "content": "On the morning of July 28, the SPC issued a moderate risk for much of Wisconsin, with an enhanced risk area extending from eastern Minnesota to southern Michigan, and southward into the extreme northern portions of Illinois and Indiana.[2] As a frontal-wave low and associated warm front moved across the Great Lakes region, an extremely unstable and increasingly moist environment was in place across part of Minnesota and most of Wisconsin. By the late afternoon and early evening hours, significant moisture advection and daytime heating had occurred, with steep lapse rates present and CAPE values reaching up to 4500 J/kg across the threat area. With the aforementioned parameters in place, the potential existed for a significant, widespread damaging straight-line wind event to occur, potentially reaching derecho criteria. However, with helicity values at up to 600 J/kg, and effective shear reaching 70 kts, a secondary threat for tornadic supercells and embedded circulations within the line was also present, and a 10% risk area for tornadoes was outlined. Late that evening, several supercell thunderstorms initiated and intensified rapidly in the threat area. The supercells quickly merged into a linear MCS, which pushed southward across Wisconsin overnight and into the early morning hours of July 29. While the line of storms did not reach derecho criteria, extensive damage from straight-line winds and weak tornados embedded within the squall line occurred across a large portion of Wisconsin. Two EF1 tornadoes caused damage to many trees and the roofs of homes in the Madison, Wisconsin suburbs of West Middleton and Verona. The storms produced additional wind damage in the extreme northern portions of Illinois and Indiana, before weakening to sub-severe levels and pushing though the Ohio Valley region by sunrise.[3] As remnants of the initial MCS complex decayed over Ohio, decreasing clouds, along with increasing temperatures and moisture began to overspread the Ohio Valley and farther east into the Mid-Atlantic region. The SPC issued slight risk with a 2% tornado risk area for the Ohio Valley, and an enhanced risk with a 5% tornado risk in the Mid-Atlantic states. Moderate shear and instability were in place across both regions, with 1000-2000 J/kg of CAPE and 40-45 kts of shear. A few tornadoes were expected to occur, though the main threat was thought to be hail and damaging winds. However, areas of enhanced helicity from remnant outflow boundaries were present as well, and the low-level wind profile became favorable for rotating supercells and tornadoes as the day progressed. By the afternoon, numerous tornadic supercells had developed, and many tornadoes touched down, a few of which were significant. This included an EF2\u00a0tornado that caused substantial damage in New Athens, Ohio. An EF3 tornado, the strongest of the outbreak, severely impacted suburban areas of the Philadelphia metro area, injuring 5 people and destroying structures. This tornado promoted the NWS office in Mount Holly, New Jersey to issue their first ever PDS tornado warning.[4] Farther west, storm intensity and coverage was less intense, though a few weak tornadoes also touched down in Indiana and Illinois. By the evening, the storms moved towards the coast and out into the Atlantic Ocean, including a supercell that spawned an EF2 tornado which struck High Bar Harbor, New Jersey, resulting in structural damage and minor injuries. Severe storms and tornado activity had ceased and moved out of the area after sunset.[5][6] Damage totaled US$315 million.[7]"

From May 19\u201a\u00c4\u00ec27, 2024, two derechos occurred and tornadoes were reported across large portions of the Central United States, with multiple Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) watches issued across the sequence.[12][13][14][15] On May 19, strong tornadoes occurred with isolated supercells in Colorado and Oklahoma while a derecho produced widespread wind damage and weak tornadoes across Kansas into the early morning hours of May 20. Limited tornadic activity took place on May 20, but another outbreak along with widespread damage struck mainly Iowa and Wisconsin on May 21. Five fatalities were confirmed with a large, violent, long-tracked EF4 tornado that went through Greenfield, Iowa. Scattered to widespread severe weather and tornadoes occurred over the next two days, including an EF2 tornado that injured 30 people on the west side of Temple, Texas. Another derecho formed in southwestern Nebraska late on May 23 and moved eastward, producing widespread wind damage and weak tornadoes through Nebraska and Iowa and northwestern Illinois before withering away in the northern part of the state during the morning hours of May 24. A nocturnal outbreak occurred during the overnight hours of May\u00a025 into May\u00a026. An isolated supercell in northern Texas produced multiple tornadoes, including a low-end EF3 tornado that passed near Valley View, Texas, killing seven people. Another longer-lived supercell moved through northeastern Oklahoma and across northern Arkansas, producing several tornadoes along with straight-line winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). Two fatalities were confirmed from an EF3 tornado that struck Claremore, Oklahoma along with areas near Pryor. Later, it produced a very large EF3 tornado near Decatur, Arkansas, which became the largest tornado ever recorded in Arkansas. Another EF3 tornado killed four people near Olvey and Pyatt while an additional tornadic death occurred with yet another EF3 tornado that passed near Yellville and through Briarcliff. Another supercell in southern Missouri produced a low-end EF3 tornado that passed near Morehouse and through Sikeston, killing one. May 26 would be the most active day of severe weather; several rounds of squall lines and tornadic supercells moved through the Mid-Mississippi and the Ohio Valleys, producing widespread wind damage, large hail, and tornadoes. This included a very destructive, intense high-end EF3 tornado that prompted the issuance of four tornado emergencies across areas that had been previously impacted by the 2021 Western Kentucky tornado. One person was killed by this tornado.[16] Severe weather activity became more isolated and scattered on May 27, marking the end of the outbreak sequence. In all, 247 tornadoes occurred during the outbreak sequence; 21 people were killed by tornadoes while 10 other people died due to non-tornadic events as well. Over 240 people were injured."

Across the highest risk area, forecasters warned of the potential for a developing derecho capable of producing damaging winds upwards of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[17] By the early afternoon hours, a northwest-to-southeast-oriented dryline extended from eastern Colorado into the Texas Panhandle, while a cold front laid across northern and central Kansas. Between these boundaries, dewpoints rose into the lower 60s \u00ac\u221eF and effective wind shear reached 50\u00a0kn (60\u00a0mph; 90\u00a0km/h), supportive of supercell thunderstorms that would likely evolve into a line of storms as a shortwave trough approached from the west.[18] Given the environment, the SPC issued a particularly dangerous situation severe thunderstorm watch across much of Kansas, northwestern Oklahoma, and the far northeastern Texas Panhandle.[19] An intense supercell developed in north-central Kansas, producing large hail in excess of 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm), tornadoes, and a wind gust to 71\u00a0kn (82\u00a0mph; 131\u00a0km/h) near Russell,[20] eventually growing upscale as additional convective clusters formed to the southwest.[21] In Oklahoma, an isolated intense supercell developed and tracked eastward toward the Oklahoma City metropolitan area as low-level wind shear began to increase.[22] Meanwhile, dual mesoscale convective vortices tracked across eastern Kansas,[23] contributing to widespread damaging wind reports\u201a\u00c4\u00eeincluding multiple high wind gusts in excess of 65\u00a0kn (75\u00a0mph; 120\u00a0km/h)\u201a\u00c4\u00eeas well as several tornadoes.[24] As the complexes continued into Missouri, they encountered more stable air, causing the severe threat to gradually diminish.[25]"

Here, forecasters expected a mixture of supercells and clusters of storms to originate near the Palmer Divide. Although rich moisture waned with westward extent,[26] dewpoints in the upper 50s to lower 60s \u00ac\u221eF were expected to spread northwestward from Kansas and into Colorado.[27] Thunderstorms developed in this area by the late afternoon hours, though their growth was stunted by marginal instability.[28] Several discrete supercells eventually evolved across northeastern Colorado and began to grow upscale while encountering a more moist and unstable environment to the east across western Nebraska.[29] The bowing line of storms traversed Nebraska and eventually Iowa through the pre-dawn and early morning hours of May\u00a021, resulting in continued damaging wind gusts.[30][31] On May\u00a021, the SPC issued another Moderate risk for severe weather in the states of Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, including a 15%\u00a0risk for significant tornadoes.[32] Upper-air soundings observed steep lapse rates in the middle troposphere over parts of Kansas and Missouri on the morning of May\u00a021. The SPC predicted that these conditions would spread into the primary severe weather risk area, overlapping with a moist airmass with dew points approaching 70\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (21\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) and leading to strong potential atmospheric instability.[33] That morning, an organized cluster of thunderstorms moved into Iowa after having produced severe wind gusts in central and eastern Nebraska. This line of storms continued across central and eastern Iowa just north of a warm front, presenting a continued threat for damaging wind gusts.[34] Additional storms began to develop along the border between Kansas and Nebraska ahead of an approaching trough. The SPC anticipated that the atmospheric environment over eastern Nebraska and western Iowa would become increasingly conducive for further organization of these storms into supercells.[35] A tornado watch was issued by the SPC for areas near and along the Nebraska\u201a\u00c4\u00ecIowa border region at 11:10\u00a0a.m. CDT in anticipation of these changes.[36] At 1:10\u00a0p.m. CDT, the SPC issued a tornado watch flagged as a particularly dangerous situation for much of Iowa and parts of surrounding states, including an 80% likelihood of a significant tornado occurring within the watch area.[37] Supercells were active over southwestern Iowa by the mid-afternoon, approaching an environment favorable for tornadogenesis leading into the Des Moines area.[38] Multiple tornadoes were reported in Iowa, including a damaging tornado near Corning and in Greenfield, where multiple fatalities were reported.[39][10] Tornadoes were also reported in Minnesota and Wisconsin.[39]"

Supercells were expected to evolve within a sheared and deeply unstable environment given effective wind shear of 60\u00a0kn (70\u00a0mph; 110\u00a0km/h) and mixed-layer CAPE of 3,000\u00a0J/kg. As such, very large hail was anticipated to be the main threat, although isolated tornadoes were possible too before storms grew upscale into one or more convective lines.[41] To the northeast, lines of storms tracked across Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee, with a primary risk of damaging winds and large hail.[42][43] Meanwhile, intense supercells developed across central Texas in a very unstable and deeply sheared environment, riding along outflow boundaries that enhanced the tornado threat.[44] A particularly intense EF3 tornado developed southwest of Sterling City where rocks, grass, and topsoil were stripped off of the ground. A 300\u00a0yd (270\u00a0m) wide path of trees were debarked and sandblasted, with only trunks remaining in some cases. Caliche roads were also stripped.[45] Ongoing storms across Texas eventually evolved into an intense mesoscale convective system moving across eastern portions of the state and into Louisiana through the late evening.[46]"

        "content": "On May 23, the SPC issued an Enhanced risk over central Nebraska to Western Iowa for the threat of damaging winds. Conditions weren't quite as favorable this day compared to others with dew points only expected to reach the upper 50s \u00ac\u221eF, creating conditions for high-base supercells, lowering the tornado potential. However, CAPE values were still able to reach 1000-3000 J/kg. Combined with shear reaching 45-55 kts, conditions were favorable for severe weather.[47] Storms initiated along a front over northwest Nebraska around 4pm CDT, though the line quickly dissipated with only a supercell able to maintain itself as it went around the corner of Colorado as it produced several tornadoes.[48] Eventually the line reformed over Southern Nebraska and began to produce damaging winds, growing to the height of the state at 1am CDT. Despite nighttime cooling, the line maintained itself and swept across all of Iowa bringing damaging winds up to 85\u00a0mph to the entire state and producing brief, weak tornadoes.[49] Meanwhile, in Texas and Oklahoma, a Slight Risk for all hazards was issued, though the tornado threat was seen as secondary to the more likely hail threat, with dew points in the low 70s \u00ac\u221eF and CAPE values around 3000 J/kg, but a supercellular storm mode.[47] Supercells initially developed over western Texas, though failed to sustain themselves, except for a cluster that sustained themselves on the TX/OK border.[48] For May 24, the SPC initially issued a large Slight Risk from Southern Wisconsin to Central Texas, but in the 1300z Outlook upgraded northeast Illinois (for damaging winds) and a thin area of western/southern Oklahoma and northern Texas (for large hail) to an Enhanced Risk.[50] The line MCS from the previous night in Iowa continued into the late morning and produced a couple tornadoes over that area of Illinois. Following this, little tornado activity occurred during the day.[51] However, due to its long-lived hazard of damaging winds and long track length, the MCS was officially declared as a derecho by the Storm Prediction Center.[52]"

        "content": "On May\u00a025, the SPC warned of an outbreak of severe thunderstorms across a level 4/Moderate risk area that encompassed much of Oklahoma and Kansas, as well as southwestern Missouri. In this region, forecasters expected the development of a few discrete supercells that would be capable of producing giant hail and strong to violent tornadoes. Across the northern portion of the risk, these supercells were forecast to evolve into a mesoscale convective system with swaths of damaging winds into the overnight hours.[53] The potential for a level 5/High risk was discussed by forecasters in the preceding 24 hours given \"a rare combination of instability and shear\" that was depicted by model guidance.[54] However, multiple uncertainties precluded a categorical upgrade, particularly questions about the influence of storms in Texas on the risk area farther north. A broad upper-level trough existed over the Western United States, with several embedded shortwaves, one of which was expected to translate across the risk area during the afternoon. A stationary boundary lifted northward as a warm front while a dryline sharpened from western Kansas into western Texas. In the warm sector between these boundaries, dewpoints rose into the upper 60s to even mid-70s \u00ac\u221eF, aiding in the development of extreme mixed-layer instability of 4,000\u201a\u00c4\u00ec5,000\u00a0J/kg.[55][56] A particularly dangerous situation tornado watch was subsequently issued for portions of extreme northern Texas, much of Oklahoma, and south-central Kansas.[57] Shortly thereafter, multiple supercells evolved over time across Texas and Oklahoma, but the convective evolution quickly became messy as splitting storms developed in close proximity.[58] Additional supercells evolved across northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas, but those too underwent negative interaction with left-split storms and their accompanying outflow approaching from the south.[59][60] As a result, central Oklahoma was completely void of storms for the entire day. Just before midnight, however two distinct areas of severe weather became the focus of intense tornadic activity. To the south, a discrete supercell developed within an extremely sheared environment north of the Dallas\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFort Worth metropolitan area. This supercell produced several tornadoes over the course of three hours, the first of which was a deadly low-end EF3 tornado near Valley View, Texas, before dissipating.[61] To the north, several supercells formed in northeastern Oklahoma and southern Kansas, while a southeast-propagating mesoscale convective system developed across northern Kansas. A line of discrete storms also formed in eastern Oklahoma, but they all quickly dissipated.[62] Meanwhile, the supercells moved eastward across northeastern Oklahoma, southern Missouri, and northern Arkansas continued into the pre-dawn hours,[63] resulting in multiple large, intense, and fatal tornadoes. A bowing mesoscale convective system evolved across the mid-Mississippi River Valley by sunrise.[64] As the convective line with a history of damaging wind gusts spread eastward across the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys through the morning hours, it encountered a warming and destabilizing airmass, further increasing the severe threat.[65] This initial line moved toward portions of West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina and was subsequently trailed by a secondary line of convection across western portions Kentucky and Tennessee.[66][67] Cumulatively, this resulted in hundreds of damaging wind reports.[68] Meanwhile, farther to the south and west, forecasters became increasingly concerned about a corridor from southeastern Missouri eastward into western Kentucky and adjacent areas. Here, the influx of warm and dry air aloft allowed for the rapid destabilization of the atmosphere previously impacted by morning storms. An outflow boundary from that convection was expected to become the focal point for enhanced tornadic activity. As such, the SPC outlined a level 4/Moderate risk across portions of the Tennessee and Ohio river valleys due to increased confidence in an outbreak of damaging winds and strong tornadoes. Supercells began to develop across southwestern Missouri during the early afternoon.[69] As they continued eastward, they encountered an increasingly favorable environment, with MLCAPE over 3,500\u00a0J/kg and effective wind shear around 50\u00a0kn (60\u00a0mph; 90\u00a0km/h).[70] Additional storms began to develop in the open warm sector across Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky as well.[71] As these supercells interacted with the remnant outflow boundary, they resulted in the formation of several strong tornadoes.[72] By the evening hours, these storms were quickly trailed by a well-organized and intense line of convection moving toward the southeast.[73] This line maintained vigorous for several hours even as it encountered a more stable airmass but finally began to lose strength as it approached the Appalachian Mountains region, resulting in a gradually diminishing severe threat through the morning of May\u00a027.[74][75] While severe storms formed across the eastern part of the continent on May 27 only a few weak tornadoes touched down in multiple areas in Georgia, Pennsylvania as well as an EF1 tornado near the Ontario-Quebec border in Rigaud, Quebec."

        "content": "This large, violent, multi-vortex tornado first touched down near the town of Villisca in Page County and moved northeastward at EF1 intensity, destroying all but one wall of an outbuilding and damaging the roof of a home. It then clipped the far northwestern tip of Taylor County before moving into Adams County, inflicting EF0 damage to trees. Continuing northeastward, the tornado reached EF1 intensity again as it approached and passed southeast of Nodaway, snapping wooden power poles, heavily damaging or destroying outbuildings, causing minor damage to homes, and snapping trees.[80] Continuing northeastward, the tornado passed just west of Brooks, destroying and throwing a grain bin and damaging trees. Crossing US 34 west of Corning and continuing northeastward, the tornado heavily damaged or destroyed outbuildings, inflicted roof damage to homes and snapped trees. As the tornado crossed Iowa 148, an outbuilding was obliterated, and a home suffered moderate roof damage with its garage being destroyed. This damage was rated low-end EF2.[80] A woman driving on Iowa 148 died when she was ejected from her car after it was lofted by the tornado.[81] The tornado continued northeastward over rural, open terrain, with the only damage being EF0-EF1 damage to the roofs of an outbuilding and a home along the outer edge of the circulation. The next area of concentrated damage was at the intersection of 150th Street and Notchwood Avenue. The tornado was at high-end EF3 intensity here and a cinderblock home was completely leveled with the debris collapsing into the basement. Outbuildings on the property were destroyed, a loaded grain bin had its top ripped off, a tractor-trailer was lofted and turned 360\u00ac\u221e, and trees were snapped. To the northeast of here, the tornado continued over open terrain. EF2 damage was inflicted to a large metal outbuilding that lost its roof with EF1 roof damage to a home along with a destroyed outbuilding. It also toppled at least five wind turbines at EF2 strength along this portion of the track, including one turbine that caught on fire.[80] The tornado exhibited violent motion and multiple vortices along this segment of the path as well. The tornado then crossed into Adair County and continued northeastward through Richland Township at EF1 intensity, uprooting and snapping trees, inflicting roof and siding damage to a home, toppling a silo, and damaging an outbuilding.[80] After toppling another wind turbine, knocking down a metal transmission tower, and destroying an outbuilding at EF2 intensity, the tornado quickly became violent and reached low-end EF4 intensity, leveling multiple homes and outbuildings. Severe damage to other homes and outbuildings also occurred and trees were snapped, including some that had partial debarking. As the tornado approached Greenfield from the southwest, it inflicted EF1-EF3 damage with two homes and several outbuildings being destroyed, another home suffering severe roof damage, and multiple vehicles being tossed.[80] The tornado then turned east-northeastward and became violent again, reaching its peak intensity of mid-range EF4 as it moved through Greenfield. Dozens of homes were leveled with some homes being partially to completely swept away, and mobile homes and outbuildings were obliterated. Many other homes suffered extensive roof and exterior wall damage or were shifted off their foundations, and many large trees were snapped and stubbed, including some that landed on and contributed to houses being leveled. All throughout the town, vehicles were destroyed and wooden power poles were snapped as well.[80][10] Four fatalities and 35 injuries were reported in the town.[9][82][10] As the tornado moved through the town, a Doppler on Wheels measured winds initially reported as being at least >250\u00a0mph (400\u00a0km/h), \"possibly as high as 290\u00a0mph (470\u00a0km/h)\" at 48 yards (44\u00a0m) above the surface.[77] Pieter Groenemeijer, the director of the European Severe Storms Laboratory noted that \"on the IF-scale, 250 mph measured below 60 m above ground level is IF4 on the IF-scale, 290 mph is IF5.\"[78] After further analysis, this report was revised to winds of 308\u201a\u00c4\u00ec319\u00a0mph (496\u201a\u00c4\u00ec513\u00a0km/h) at 36\u201a\u00c4\u00ec38 yards (33\u201a\u00c4\u00ec35\u00a0m) above the surface.[79] An EF2 tornado developed to the northeast of Greenfield as the violent tornado moved through the town. After exiting Greenfield, this tornado moved east-northeastward, weakened, and dissipated over open terrain as the other tornado became the dominant circulation within the supercell.[80] The tornado was on the ground for 48 minutes, traveled 43.07\u00a0mi (69.31\u00a0km), and had a peak width of 1,600\u00a0yd (1.5\u00a0km).

        "content": "This intense, deadly, long-tracked tornado initially touched down southeast of Bowie in Montague County at 9:39 pm CDT. It initially caused EF0-EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings as it moved through rural areas. Moving eastward, the tornado intensified to EF2 strength, causing severe damage to two rural residences, with lesser damage being inflicted to other nearby residences. The tornado then weakened slightly as it continued eastward and passed south of Forestburg. Widespread EF0 to high-end EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings, along with minor damage to homes, was observed along this segment of the path. The tornado further weakened as it turned east-southeastward, crossed into Cooke County, and passed through Rosston, causing widespread EF0 tree damage. As the tornado approached and crossed FM 51 south of Era, the tornado strengthened again, with trees and structures suffering EF1 damage. Further strengthening occurred as the tornado continued eastward southeast of Era and west of Valley View, inflicting EF2 damage to three residences. After causing some additional EF1 damage, the tornado reached its peak intensity of low-end EF3 along County Road 200.[80] Several newly constructed homes were heavily damaged or destroyed with roofs removed and exterior walls knocked down. To the east, the tornado struck a neighborhood along West Lone Oak Rd at EF2 intensity heavily damaging manufactured and mobile homes, including some that were demolished. All seven fatalities occurred at this location. The tornado was at its maximum width of 1,200\u00a0yd (1,100\u00a0m) at this point, but the damage path was over a mile wide. It is believed that several smaller circulations were rotating around the tornado, making it seem larger than it actually was.[83] The tornado maintained high-end EF2 intensity as it crossed I-35 at the Lone Oak Road/FM 3002 interchange south of Valley View, tossing multiple cars and tractor-trailers off the interstate. On the east side of the interstate, a Shell gas station, where dozens of people had taken shelter in, a metal building shop, and an RV and boat storage units were heavily damaged or destroyed. Despite the heavy damage, no one was killed in the gas station. Continuing eastward along FM 3002 towards Ray Roberts Lake causing more roof damage to structures along with tree damage. The tornado then weakened to EF1 strength, crossed the lake, and struck a mobile home and RV park at the Ray Roberts Lake State Park Johnson Branch on the Cooke County-Denton County border, tossing and rolling multiple mobile homes and RVs, including some that were thrown in the lake, and causing additional tree damage.[80] The tornado then began to occlude near Pilot Point and crossed back into Cooke County. Some tree damage was observed at the end Anderson Road before the tornado dissipated over the lake at 11:15 pm CDT.[83][3] The tornado was on the ground for over an hour and a half, reaching a peak width of 1,200\u00a0yd (1,100\u00a0m) along its 47.27-mile (76.07\u00a0km) journey. It killed seven people, making it the deadliest tornado of both the outbreak sequence and in the United States in 2024, and injured 80-100 others, excluding possible people with minor injuries that didn't require hospitaliztion.[84] It was also the deadliest tornado in the United States since a tornado in Tennessee killed nine people in March 2023.[83][3][85] Due to a malfunction, tornado sirens in Valley View would not sound. However, the areas affected by the tornado would not have been able to hear it.[86] Recovery efforts were also hampered by an inch of rain that fell across the region.[87]"

Upon touching down, the tornado inflicted roof damage to a home and uprooted trees at EF1 intensity. The tornado then moved eastward and strengthened to high-end EF1 intensity as it passed north of Valley Park, snapping and uprooting more trees. The tornado then passed through Keetonville, continuing to snap and uproot trees as it began to move along SH-20. The tornado then turned to the east-northeast and moved into Claremore, snapping dozens of trees, and damaging businesses, metal building systems, and other structures. An area of EF2 damage was observed just east of downtown, where two homes and a two-story building had their roofs partially removed and power poles were snapped. The tornado then continued eastward, continuing to inflict high-end EF1 roof damage to homes and snapping and uprooting trees before crossing I-44 north of Justice. The tornado then restrengthened to EF2 intensity after crossing the interstate and turning east-northeastward, partially or completely removing the roofs off several houses, including some that had exterior walls knocked down, inflicted heavy damage to the Cherokee Casino Will Rogers Downs while destroying several RVs nearby, (the casino didn't reopen until three months later)[88] flattening an outbuilding, and snapping numerous trees. The tornado then briefly reached its peak intensity of mid-range EF3 along E480 Road. Two homes had all of their exterior walls knocked with one of them having some interior walls knocked down as well. Two nearby homes suffered heavy EF2 damage as well with roofs removed and exterior walls knocked down. The tornado then briefly paralleled I-44 at high-end EF2 intensity, ripping off roofs and knocking down the exterior walls of homes, heavily damaging or destroying outbuildings, and snapping and uprooting numerous trees.[80] The tornado then turned east-southeastward and moved into Mayes County, continuing to snap and uproot trees at EF2 strength. A mobile home just east of the county line was obliterated and swept away, killing two people and injuring four others. A nearby home had all of its exterior walls knocked down with damage to interior walls as well. After briefly weakening to EF1 intensity, the tornado inflicted EF2 roof damage to homes and snapped more trees. It then reached low-end EF3 intensity northwest of Pryor along N 428, knocking down the exterior walls of a home and sweeping away a mobile home. The tornado then began to quickly weaken, snapping and uprooting trees before dissipating at 11:59 pm CDT, ending its 23.88-mile-journey (38.43\u00a0km).[80] It was on the ground for 40 minutes, reached a peak width of 2,000\u00a0yd (1,800\u00a0m), killed two people, and injured at least 23 others. The tornado was accompanied by extensive straight-line winds associated with the rear flank downdraft outside of the tornado track to the south, which caused additional damage.[85][89][90][91]"

It also damaged trees, snapped power poles, and caused roof and exterior wall damage to houses; this damage was rated mid-range to high-end EF1. The tornado then weakened slightly to EF1 intensity as it continued to snap trees in an open field before crossing US 65. After crossing the highway, it caused minor damage to the roofs and light poles of the Boone County Sheriff's Department and an Arkansas State Police troop center, damaged a storage unit complex, overturned an RV, and caused a large metal building to collapse as it continued to move east. To the east of there, the tornado grew in width and continued to snap trees and power poles. It then quickly intensified to low end EF3 intensity, throwing and destroying two unanchored homes along Penny Lane, injuring one person. A nearby mobile home was lofted, rolled, and destroyed, and trees were snapped, including some that were stubbed.[80] The tornado then turned northeastward and passed southeast of Olvey, continuing to cause damage to trees, and killing a woman inside of a mobile home which was destroyed.[92] Extensive EF1 tree damage continued as the tornado continued east-northeastward and crossed into Marion County. It then passed south of Pyatt, where more homes suffered moderate to heavy roof damage, mobile homes were heavily damaged, including one that was rolled and destroyed, and more trees were snapped. Three people were killed as it moved south of, and eventually crossed, US 62 where it briefly strengthened to EF2 strength. A home was heavily damaged and power poles were left leaning. After continuing northeast and snapping trees at EF1 intensity as it crossed AR 125, the tornado again briefly reached EF2 intensity. A mobile home was completely obliterated with no sign of any part of the structure being left behind and more trees were snapped. The tornado continued to cause significant tree damage until it dissipated north-northwest of Summit at 4:04\u00a0a.m. CDT (09:04 UTC).[80] The tornado was on the ground for approximately 37 minutes, traveling a total path length of 21.10\u00a0mi (33.96\u00a0km), and reaching a peak width of 1,500\u00a0yd (1,400\u00a0m).

Moving generally eastward as it fluctuated between mid-range to high-end EF1 intensity, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees as it approached and then crossed AR 14. Beyond that point, the tornado continued to snap and uproot trees as it moved along county roads with some homes suffering minor roof damage as well. Further to the east along Backway Road, a mobile home and an outbuilding were shifted off their foundations, and more trees were snapped or uprooted, including one tree that fell on the mobile home. More trees were snapped or uprooted as the tornado crossed County Road 6074 and an outbuilding was destroyed. The tornado then grew significantly to over 1,000 yards (910\u00a0m) wide, snapping and uprooting numerous trees as it moved over Hand Mountain before crossing the White River into Baxter County. Some homes in a small residential area on the other side of the river suffered minor roof and siding damage and countless trees were snapped or uprooted. The tornado then reached its maximum width of 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) as it briefly turned east-northeastward before continuing eastward, producing a widespread area of snapped and uprooted trees. The tornado then contracted slightly, producing swaths of uprooted and snapped trees before crossing the White River again. The tornado then abruptly made a sharp left turn as it passed between Arkana and Norfork and began moving north-northeast, crossing the White River a third time and approaching Briarcliff, snapping and uprooting more trees as it moved over and then away from AR 201. As it reached AR 5, the tornado increased in strength, snapping and uprooting dozens of trees, and heavily damaging homes and a metal shop building. Five fifth-wheel recreation trailers at an RV/trailer camping park were tossed and destroyed, resulting in a fatality. The tornado also snapped two-poled wooden 350\u00a0kW transmission towers and bent two pairs of double-posted steel high transmission line posts in half. Damage in this area was rated EF1-EF2.[80][94] The strong tornado then turned northeastward and once again grew to 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) wide as it entered Briarcliff, snapping and uprooting a large number of trees as it moved over the hilly terrain. A few homes sustained moderate damage from both tornadic winds and flying debris. The most significant damage occurred on top of a hill on Scenic Drive, where the Briarcliff City Hall building had its top floor almost completely destroyed with several lower-level walls also collapsing. This damage was rated low-end EF3. Several outbuildings were destroyed, and a two-story home lost its roof as well. Areas to the west and northwest of the tornado also suffered damage due to a low-end EF2 satellite tornado that traveled in close proximity to this tornado as it moved through Briarcliff. Continuing northeastward, the tornado crossed Norfork Lake at EF1 intensity, continuing to cause widespread tree damage as it moved over peninsulas adjacent to the lake. After crossing the lake, the tornado struck the Holiday Hills Resort Area, damaging several buildings, including a smaller cabin building that was unroofed and had multiple exterior walls knocked down. By this time, the tornado was shrinking in size, although it was still uprooting large areas of trees. After crossing into Fulton County, the tornado moved erratically northeastward, snapping and uprooting additional trees before dissipating at 4:51\u00a0a.m. CDT (09:51 UTC) northwest of Elizabeth.[80][94] The tornado reached a peak width of 1,760\u00a0yd (1,610\u00a0m) along its 52-minute, 36.3\u00a0mi-journey (58.4\u00a0km).

Moving northeastward, the tornado steadily strengthened as it crossed into New Madrid County, damaging and snapping more trees and inflicting roof damage to a home. An area of EF2 damage occurred just beyond this point where at least five consecutive wooden power poles were snapped to the south of Morehouse. After snapping more trees at high-end EF1 strength, the tornado abruptly reached low-end EF3 intensity along County Road 824. A well-built brick home had its roof removed and most of its exterior walls knocked down and wooden power poles were snapped. The tornado quickly weakened back to high-end EF1 intensity as it crossed US 60. More trees were snapped, a mobile home suffered roof damage and an outbuilding was heavily damaged. Another small area of EF2 damage occurred along Route FF south of Browns where several wooden power poles were snapped. After flipping a center pivot irrigation system, the tornado entered Sikeston while straddling the New Madrid-Scott County at EF1 intensity, snapping and uprooting trees, and inflicting roof, siding, and exterior wall damage to homes. The tornado then moved solidly into Scott County and through the south side Sikeston. A widespread area of snapped and uprooted trees and roof damage to homes and outbuildings occurred. Along South Main Street (US 61/US 62), a strip mall and several businesses had their roofs partially or completely removed. The tornado continued to snap power poles and trees and damage homes as it moved northeastward until it reached US 62 again east of Sikeston, where it restrengthened to EF2 intensity. A school and a business had part of their roofs removed and large cinderblock walls knocked down, another business suffered roof damage, a tall wooden light pole at a ball field was knocked down, a home lost most of its roof, and more trees and power poles were snapped. The tornado then exited Sikeston as it continued northeastward as it approached and then crossed I-55 north of Miner, damaging outbuildings, inflicting roof damage to homes, and snapping trees at EF1 strength. Similar damage occurred after the tornado crossed the interstate and into more rural areas with center pivot irrigation systems also being damaged. The tornado then clipped the northwestern part of Diehlstadt, damaging trees before dissipating north of the town.[80][95] The tornado traveled 19.58\u00a0mi (31.51\u00a0km) over a span of 16 minutes, reaching a peak width of 300\u00a0yd (270\u00a0m).[80][95][96] One person was killed by a fallen tree limb in New Madrid County.[97]"

Two outbuildings were destroyed, many trees were snapped, and cycloidal scour marks were left in farm fields as well.[80][95] As the tornado crossed into Caldwell County, the first of four tornado emergencies was issued as a debris ball was evident on radar and law enforcement reported that a large tornado was in progress.[99] Upon entering Caldwell County, the tornado weakened to high-end EF1 intensity, snapping dozens of trees and damaging power poles. Southeast of Crider, a barn along KY 91 was mostly destroyed. The tornado then turned due east, snapping and uprooting more trees north of Princeton before briefly strengthening to high-end EF2 intensity, along KY 293. A mobile home was destroyed, a home was completely unroofed, and trees were snapped. Another home suffered minor roof damage as well.[80][95] The tornado then turned back to the east-northeast and continued at EF1 intensity, heavily damaging an outbuilding, inflicting roof damage to homes, and snapping more trees. Another area of high-end EF2 damage occurred along Princeton Olney Road, where wooden power poles and large trees were snapped. The tornado then began to grow in size as it approached Charleston, causing widespread tree damage. As the tornado crossed into Hopkins County it reintensified to high-end EF2 intensity and reached its peak width of 700 yards (640\u00a0m) north of Dawson Springs. Several homes were severely damaged with roofs ripped off and exterior walls knocked down, outbuildings were destroyed, and many trees were snapped. The tornado then narrowed but rapidly reached high-end EF3 strength southwest of Charleston where a home was flattened. South of Charleston along KY 109, more homes were leveled, including one poorly-anchored home that was removed from its foundation, other homes were heavily damaged or shifted off their foundations, outbuildings were destroyed, and more trees were snapped. Turning eastward at high-end EF2 intensity, the tornado snapped dozens of trees and obliterated two mobile homes before reaching low-end EF3 intensity along Daylight Road, flattening two poorly-anchored homes. Another home was destroyed at EF3 intensity northwest of St. Charles, killing one person and injuring another before the tornado rapidly weakened to high-end EF1 strength. It snapped trees along KY 112 and moved through heavily forested areas before rapidly reaching high-end EF3 intensity as it moved directly through Barnsley and crossed US 41. A home was flattened, two double-wide mobile homes were obliterated, and trees were snapped. Immediately after leaving the town, the tornado abruptly dissipated north of Mortons Gap just before crossing I-69 at 9:15 PM (02:15 UTC). The parent supercell was rapidly absorbed by a squall line at that time, which caused the tornadic circulation to dissipate.[80][95] The tornado was on the ground for 74 minutes, traveling 35.05 miles (56.41\u00a0km), and reaching a peak width of 700 yards (640\u00a0m). One person was killed, and 21 others were injured.[80][95][100]"

On Ladypool Road, several shops had their windows blown out and lost portions of their roofs. Ladypool Primary School was extensively damaged and lost its distinctive Martin & Chamberlain tower. The adjacent St Agatha's Church also suffered some damage. Several rows of homes along Birchwood Road and Alder Road in Balsall Heath had their roofs torn off, and top floor walls torn down. Cars were rolled several meters (yards) down driveways. Along Roshven Road, an end terrace house lost all top floor exterior walls. Christ Church (consecrated in 1867), on the corner of Dolobran Road and Grantham Road in Sparkbrook, was also damaged and has now been demolished.[4][5] The Met Office and TORRO (The Tornado and Storm Research Organisation) estimated that the tornado had a general T4 rating on the TORRO scale, with a short spell with T5 damage,[6] which would indicate wind speeds between 137 and 186\u00a0mph (220 and 299\u00a0km/h),[7] equivalent to an F2 tornado on the Fujita scale. There were no fatalities, although there were approximately 39 injuries, three of which were reported to be serious. The tornado uprooted an estimated 1,100 trees, removed the roofs of buildings, picked up and deposited cars and caused other damage during its short existence.[8] The tornado is the costliest on record in the UK, having caused \u00a340 million of damage, equivalent to \u00a375 million in 2023.[9] "

Lehar was the second most intense tropical cyclone of the 2013 season, surpassed by Cyclone Phailin, as well as one of the two relatively strong cyclones that affected Southern India in November 2013, the other being Cyclone Helen. The origins of Lehar can be tracked back to an area of low pressure that formed in the South China Sea on 18 November. The system slowly drifted westwards and entered the Bay of Bengal, where it quickly consolidated into a depression on 23 November. It moved west-northwest into an improving environment for further development before the system was named Lehar on 24 November, after it had developed into a cyclonic storm and passed over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands into the Bay of Bengal. Lehar gradually intensified further into a very severe cyclonic storm, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), reaching its peak on 26 November, with 3-minute sustained wind speeds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 982\u00a0mbar (29.0\u00a0inHg). Moving along a generally west-northwestward path in the following days, the storm passed over an area having cooler waters and a moderate vertical wind shear. The storm's low-level circulation center (LLCC) started losing its structure, triggering a weakening trend. Lehar rapidly weakened to a Depression on 28 November and its fully exposed LLCC made its second landfall over the coast of Andhra Pradesh near Machilipatnam. The same day, it was last noted as a well marked low-pressure area over Andhra Pradesh. Extensive preparation was done in the wake of the storm by the authorities of the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, including the evacuation of 45,000 people in low-lying areas. The storm's rapid weakening before landfall led to no reported fatalities and minimal damage."

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system, assuming that it would intensify further as it moves into warmer sections of the Bay of Bengal.[4] Tracking westward at over 08 knots (15\u00a0km/h; 9.2\u00a0mph), the system gradually intensified over the next 24 hours. Early on 23 November, the JTWC classified the system as a Tropical Storm, designating it with 05B.[5] A couple of hours later, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) started tracking this system as a Depression. It was initially assigned the code BOB 07.[6] Early the next day, the IMD reported that BOB 07 had reached deep depression status,[7] and immediately afterwards, they upgraded BOB 07 into a cyclonic storm, naming it Lehar.[8] Being located in an area of moderate vertical wind shear of around 15 knots (28\u00a0km/h; 17\u00a0mph), convection gradually consolidated around the LLCC, though being slightly displaced towards the northwest.[9] Later that day, Lehar developed a weak microwave eye-like feature.[10] Lehar made its first landfall south of Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar, early on 25 November. However, it maintained strength.[11] The cyclone strengthened further and developed strong radial outflow, compensating the moderate vertical wind shear in the region. Following this development, the IMD upgraded Lehar to a Severe Cyclonic Storm. The JTWC also upgraded the system to a Category 1 Tropical Cyclone on the SSHS with winds of over 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph).[12][13] However, multispectral satellite imagery showed that a deep central dense overcast was obscuring the low level circulation. The JTWC had poor confidence in the storm's position and couldn't exactly locate its center.[14] Lehar continued to track in a westerly direction just along the periphery of a subtropical ridge.[15] Early on 26 November, the IMD upgraded Lehar to a Very Severe Cyclonic storm. Meanwhile, they have warned the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha of heavy rainfall and strong winds.[16] Under the steering influence of the subtropical ridge, Lehar continued to track in a west-northwesterly direction. The storm maintained a peak 1-minute average sustained windspeed of 75 knots (139\u00a0km/h; 86\u00a0mph).[17] On passing over cooler waters and experiencing moderate easterly vertical wind shear, the storm started losing intensity.[18] Though deep convection persisted along its well-define center, microwave imagery depicted drier air, restricting moist inflow along the southwestern periphery of the system.[19] On 27 November, the convection around the storm's center started losing its structural organization. A scatterometer pass indicated the elongation of the LLCC with weakening wind field.[20] Thereafter, Leher rapidly weakened into a Depression and made landfall south of Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh on 28 November.[21] Increased frictional forces led to the degeneration of the storm into a well-marked low-pressure area, while it moved inland."

As a result of the formation of Viyaru, the low level equatorial monsoon flow strengthened over southern parts of the North Indian Ocean, which in turn allowed the south-west monsoon to set in over the Andaman Sea and parts of the Bay of Bengal during May 17.[2] A depression developed and made landfall on West Bengal, during May 29, before it was last noted during May 31. During June 1, the south-west monsoon set in over Kerala, the Maldives and parts of the south and central Arabian Sea. Over the next two weeks one of the fastest onsets of the monsoon over India was observed  After the monsoon had set in over Kerala, one of the fastest onsets of the monsoon over India was observed, with the whole nation covered by June 16 or about a month earlier than normal.

Early on May 16, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23\u00a0inHg).[9] Shortly thereafter Viyaru made landfall near Chittagong, Bangladesh.[10] On May 17, it moved over the eastern Indian state of Nagaland.[11] Early in the storm's existence, it brought flooding rains to much of northwestern Indonesia, resulting in significant damage. At least four people died and six others were reported missing.[12][13] In preparation for the storm, large-scale evacuations were recommended for parts of Myanmar. This resulted with people overcrowding boats to escape, and one or several vessels capsized, causing at least 39 deaths; 42 people were rescued while 19 others were unaccounted for and feared dead.[14][15] The storm's expansive cloud mass also brought unsettled weather to Sri Lanka, Thailand, and southeastern India. Severe storms in India and Sri Lanka were responsible for at least 16\u00a0fatalities and significant damage;[16][17] one person died in Thailand.[18] Striking Bangladesh in a weaker state than initially expected, damage was moderate to severe. A total of 95,003\u00a0poorly constructed huts were damaged or destroyed, 17\u00a0people died, and nearly 1.3\u00a0million were affected across the country.[19][20] Losses to crops exceeded \u09f32.75\u00a0billion (US$35.3\u00a0million).[21] Myanmar was spared damage and further casualties.[22]"

Later on the same day, the storm was upgraded into Depression BOB 07 by the IMD, while the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm.[70] The following day, the BOB 07 strengthened further into a cyclonic storm, and the IMD assigned it the name Lehar.[71] On November 25, the storm gradually consolidated further and was upgraded to a severe cyclonic storm by the IMD, while the JTWC reported that the storm had reached Category 1 status in the SSHS hurricane scale. The following day, Lehar further intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, as both IMD and JTWC reported peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 982\u00a0mbar (29.0\u00a0inHg). Early on November 27, the JTWC reported the storm's low-level circulation center (LLCC) was losing its structure due to vertical wind shear, indicating a weakening trend.[72] Thereafter, Lehar rapidly weakened into a depression and made landfall near Machilipatnam on November 28. Land interaction led to the degeneration of the storm into a well-marked low-pressure area, while it moved inland. The cyclone affected the Andaman Islands with heavy rain and strong winds. It caused flooding, landslides, road blockage, uprooting of trees and damage to buildings. More than two dozen fishermen went missing and almost all of them were rescued by the Coast Guard and police. In Little Andaman, more than 2000 people were evacuated and kept in Onge-tikrey community hall there.

A day later, microwave satellite imagery revealed a broad low-level circulation center (LLCC).[76] The system slowly drifted northeastward over the next couple of days and slowly intensified. Though the sea surface temperatures were good enough for tropical cyclogenesis, moderate vertical wind shear kept the system from strengthening too quickly.[77] On December 5, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system.[78] The following day, the storm strengthened further, and the JTWC initiated advisories on the system, designating it as \"06B\".[79] Around the same time, the IMD started tracking this system as Depression BOB 08.[80] The storm remained nearly stationary over the next 24 hours. Early on December 7, the IMD further upgraded BOB 08 into a Deep Depression,[81] and later upgrading it to Cyclonic Storm Madi about 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) from Trincomalee, Sri Lanka.[82] Tracking slowly north-northwestward under the influence of a deep shortwave trough,[83] the storm quickly intensified into a severe cyclonic storm.[84] Madi accelerated slightly while maintaining a large area of convection.[85] By December 8, Madi had developed an excellent poleward outflow, with deep convection wrapped into a well-defined center. Both the JTWC and IMD were reporting winds of 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph) at the center.[86] With this, the IMD upgraded Madi to a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm, the third in 2013.[87] However, Madi moved into an area of increasing vertical wind shear, causing weakening. Madi's poleward track was explained by the strong subtropical ridge located to the east of the system.[88] On December 9, the IMD reported that Madi had weakened into a Severe Cyclonic storm.[89] Despite the wind shear, Madi developed an eye on December 10,[90] and the JTWC assessed the system as a Category 1 equivalent for a second time. Against all expectations, the storm continued to track in a northerly direction,[91] until later that day, when it made a sharp, sudden, southwestward turn. Madi started losing all its convection to the strong wind shear.[92] Another subtropical ridge located over India had steered the system southwestward.[93] On December 11, Madi's LLCC became clearly exposed after dry air wrapped around the southern part of the system. This weakened Madi[94] into a Cyclonic Storm,[95] and later into a deep depression.[96] Overnight, Madi weakened further into a depression[97] and crossed the  Tamil Nadu coast close to Vedaranyam around 1330 UTC on December 12, 2013. It then emerged into the Palk Strait at 1530 UTC and crossed the Tamil Nadu coast again near Thondi at 1700 UTC on the same day.[98][99] Colachel in Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu got the highest rainfall of 115\u00a0mm in 24 hours on December 13.[100][101]"

The fifth tropical or subtropical cyclone and third named storm of the 1982 Atlantic hurricane season, Chris developed from a surface low-pressure area in the northern Gulf of Mexico on September\u00a09. Although initially displaying subtropical characteristics, the low pressure area gradually acquired tropical characteristics, and was reclassified as Tropical Depression Four within 24\u00a0hours of development. The depression then began to intensify and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chris on September\u00a010. Thereafter, the storm turned north-north-eastward and strengthened further. On September\u00a011, Chris peaked as a 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) tropical storm. Later that day, it made landfall near Sabine Pass, Port Arthur, Texas. By September\u00a013, Chris dissipated over Arkansas. When Chris moved ashore, it caused high waves and tides along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. Though the storm made landfall in Texas, minimal impact was recorded in that state, though a restaurant suffered significant damage. Much of the impact occurred to the east, in Louisiana. Rainfall was relatively light in that state, though a few isolated areas experienced precipitation amounts higher than 15 inches (380\u00a0mm). The storm caused steady rainfall in parts of the Midwestern United States. Outside of Louisiana, there were rainfall totals higher than 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) in western Tennessee and slightly less than the storm progressed northward. Due to minor flooding, damage in Louisiana was around $1\u00a0million (1982\u00a0USD). Elsewhere, the impact was limited to mostly light to moderate rainfall, though local flooding was reported in Tennessee and Kentucky. Overall, Chris caused $2\u00a0million (1982\u00a0USD) in damage and no fatalities."

Initially, minimal development occurred, though by September\u00a08, the system became a surface low. It is estimated that the surface low became a subtropical depression by 0000\u00a0UTC on the following day. Over the next 24\u00a0hours, the low began acquiring tropical characteristics, mainly from developing deep convection on its north and east sides. By early on September\u00a010, observations from oil rigs, radars, and Air Force reconnaissance flights indicated that the subtropical system had transitioned into Tropical Depression Four.[1] However, the National Hurricane Center did not operationally issue advisories until 1900\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, at which time Chris was already a tropical storm.[1][2] In post-season analysis, it was indicated that Tropical Depression Four strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010. Due to a large low pressure trough over the Southwestern United States, Chris immediately curved northward.[1] Later that day, the National Hurricane Center noted that \"even though conditions do not favor rapid strengthening...winds could approach hurricane force before the center moves inland Saturday\".[3] As it approached closer to the Gulf Coast of the United States, Chris curved slightly east of north. Shortly before 1200\u00a0UTC, Chris made landfall near Sabine Pass, Port Arthur, Texas, with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011, Chris attained its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). Chris weakened quickly, and was downgraded to a tropical depression by early on September\u00a012 while centered over west-central Louisiana.

In the Port Arthur area, numerous power outages were reported.[5] Flooded roads and power outages were reported in Beaumont, though damage was not significant in that city.[7] Along the southwestern coast of Louisiana, tides between 4 and 7 feet (1.2 and 2.1\u00a0m) were reported.[8] On land, Chris produced tropical storm force winds in a few areas and light to moderate rainfall.[1] Throughout the state, precipitation was generally between 5 and 10 inches (130 and 250\u00a0mm), though speaking at more than 16 inches (410\u00a0mm) in Delhi.[6] Elsewhere in Louisiana, about 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) of rainfall was reported in Lake Charles.[6][9] Street flooding in Lake Charles was severe, though only a few houses suffered flood damage. To the south of Lake Charles, minor damage was reported in Cameron Parish, totaling to about $500,000 (1982\u00a0USD). However, due to high tides, damage along the coastal areas of that parish was considerable.[10] A Cameron Parish official noted, \"There's power out all over the place, and we understand there was quite a bit of damage at Holly Beach\".[7] In Evangeline Parish, an F2 tornado on the Fujita Scale destroyed four buildings and damaged seven other structures.[11] In northeastern Louisiana, wind damage was \"spotty\" and limited to downed trees and powerlines. As a result of heavy rainfall in that portion of the state, low-lying areas flooded and bayous overflowed.[12] A tornado, rated at F3, destroyed eleven houses and one church in Clayton. In addition, the tornado knocked down trees and powerlines in the area.[11] Overall, damage in Louisiana was near $1\u00a0million (1982\u00a0USD).[1] Throughout Louisiana and Mississippi, a combined total of nine tornadoes was reported.[13] One of the tornadoes in Mississippi damaged several homes and businesses in Cleveland, and at least four injuries were reported. Another tornado spawned in a rural area overturned a mobile home in Eden. Two other twisters in the state caused minimal damage.[14] In Mississippi, rains peaked at about 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) in the northwest section of the state. The rest of the state reported widespread rains of 1\u20137 inches (25\u2013178\u00a0mm). Rainfall in Alabama peaked at 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) in some areas, and similar amounts were observed in Georgia.[6] In Florida, rainfall peaked at 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) in an extremely southern part of the Panhandle. Precipitation was also recorded in Lake Okeechobee, with 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) reported there. The northeastern section of the state reported 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) of rain.

Very little rain was reported in Indiana, with only 1-inch (25\u00a0mm) on the southern border of the state. In Tennessee and Kentucky, rains of 10\u201316 inches (250\u2013410\u00a0mm) were reported with locally heavy flooding.[6][15] The western portions of Tennessee reported flood waters at least waist high in some city streets. In addition, schools in Milan were closed, while portions of U.S. Routes 70 and 79 were submerged into water. A few businesses in the city of Huntington suffered flood damage.[16] Other rains include 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) in the Carolinas, New York, Michigan, Virginia and Ohio.[6] Overall, damage from Tropical Storm Chris was slightly less than $2\u00a0million (1982\u00a0USD),[17] and no fatalities were reported.[1]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Beryl caused flooding in several states in the Eastern United States in August\u00a01994. The second named storm and third tropical cyclone of the annual hurricane season, Beryl developed from an upper-level low pressure area over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a014. Initially a tropical depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm about 24\u00a0hours after forming. Beryl then moved slowly northeastward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) before making landfall near Panama City, Florida, early on August\u00a016. Within 12\u00a0hours of moving inland, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, but persisted as a tropical cyclone for a few days while traversing the Eastern United States. Beryl was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over Connecticut early on August\u00a019. In Florida, above normal tides in the panhandle caused erosion, damaged several boats, and drowned two people. Tropical storm force winds left about 20,000\u00a0people without electricity, while flooding from heavy rainfall damaged vehicles and roads. Property damage in the state reached about $5.9\u00a0million (1994\u00a0USD).[nb 1] Farther inland, Beryl spawned many tornadoes and resulted in flooding as far north of New England. In South Carolina, the state suffering the most damage, a total of 23\u00a0tornadoes were spawned, including three rated F3 on the Fujita scale. One tornado in Lexington damaged or destroyed 200\u00a0homes and 40 to 50\u00a0buildings and caused about 15,000\u00a0people to lose power after damaging five electrical substations. The state of New York experienced the worst of the flooding, with flash flooding in the Susquehanna and western Catskills regions. Two deaths and $12\u00a0million in damage occurred in New York. Overall, Beryl left five fatalities and at least $74.22\u00a0million in damage."

        "content": "A large upper-level low pressure area developed over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to the north of Puerto Rico on August\u00a09. The disturbance moved westward, and despite weakening to a trough in the upper levels of the atmosphere, there was evidence of a low- to mid-level circulation off the southwest coast of Florida on August\u00a012. The next day, surface observations and ship reports suggested the presence of a weak 1,014\u00a0mbar (29.9\u00a0inHg) surface low pressure system. Moving towards the north-northwest, a cloud-pattern was identified on satellite imagery, and Dvorak estimates were initiated at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014. Based on data from surface observations, satellite imagery, and information from reconnaissance aircraft, the system is estimated to have become a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August 14; at the time, the depression was located approximately 120 miles (190\u00a0km) south of Pensacola, Florida.[1] Initially, the depression was predicted to move inland within the next 24\u00a0hours and intensify only slightly.[2] The depression drifted slowly towards the north after being designated, while its poorly defined center of circulation became better defined. Between 16:30 and 20:11\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014, the system was nearly stationary; a few hours later, there were indications that the storm's center reformed to the east of its original location. The depression tracked slowly towards the east-northeast while producing rainfall throughout portions of Florida.[1] By early on August\u00a015, the cyclone was becoming further organized, with satellite imagery indicating better defined rainbands.[3] Shortly thereafter, wind observations suggested that the cyclone was approaching tropical storm intensity. A reconnaissance aircraft flight recorded winds of 46 to 49\u00a0mph (74 to 79\u00a0km/h) to the southeast of the center, while offshore and coastal stations measured sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) and gusts up to 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h).[4] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl,[1] based on a reconnaissance aircraft flight observing 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) at an altitude of 1,500\u00a0ft (460\u00a0m).[5] Possibly influenced by a mesoscale featured noted to the south of Beryl's circulation, the center of circulation began moving erratically after being upgraded.[1] However, in response to an approaching trough, the storm turned towards the north.[6] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, Beryl reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and then made landfall near Panama City, Florida. It is estimated that the storm attained its minimum barometric pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg) about three hours after moving inland.[7] About\u00a012 hours after moving ashore, around 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, Beryl weakened to a tropical depression. With increasing forward motion, the depression continued towards the north-northeast.[6] At 21:00\u00a0UTC, the National Hurricane Center ceased issuing advisories on Beryl,[8] transferring responsibility to the Weather Prediction Center.[9] Despite weakening, the system maintained rainbands accompanied by thunderstorms and heavy rainfall.[10] The low continued to track northeastward; after passing through Connecticut, the low was absorbed into a frontal trough on August\u00a019.[6]"

Later that day, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning that extended from Fort Walton Beach to Yankeetown. The warning was discontinued for areas west of Apalachicola, and by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were lifted.[1] Initially, the public advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center on the storm warned primarily of heavy rain, as Beryl was expected to remain a weak cyclone. However, when the storm slowed in forward motion and the potential for intensification increased, the advisories emphasized the potential for coastal flooding.[11] Tornado watches were issued for parts of Florida. Flash flood watches and warnings were also declared for parts of the state.[12] Flash flood watches, warnings, and tornado watches were posted for portions of Georgia as Beryl progressed inland.[13] Flash flood watches and warnings were also initiated throughout parts of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland.[14] A tornado watch was declared for central and eastern North Carolina on August 17; similar advisories were placed into effect over parts of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.[15][16] Flash flood advisories were also issued northward into New York.[17]"

Several moored boats were damaged, while three people on a fishing boat offshore were rescued. Coastal flooding and erosion occurred, undermining roads and homes and damaging seawalls. The highest observed precipitation total in the state was 10.69\u00a0in (272\u00a0mm) in Apalachicola, though heavier rainfall likely occurred in areas to the east.[19] In addition, precipitation from Tropical Storm Alberto earlier in the season and Beryl produced nearly 30\u00a0in (762\u00a0mm) of rain in some areas of the Florida Panhandle in the span of barely more than a month. Flooding occurred in low-lying areas, damaging cars and homes. Oysters in the Apalachicola Bay could not be harvested in the prime winter of 1994, due to runoff from the sediment of rivers, from 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rain.[21] At the Tallahassee International Airport, a sustained wind speed of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a wind gust of 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) were observed.[22] Wind caused minor damage to roofs and downed trees, signs, and power lines, leaving about 20,000\u00a0customers without electricity.[19] Damage in the state as a result of Beryl was estimated at $5.9\u00a0million.[18]"

Throughout northeastern Georgia, several roads were flooded or washed out, while numerous roads in that state were also effected by mudslides. Pressure from the floodwaters damaged a number of culverts and sewer lines. One death and three injuries occurred in the Chattooga River when a group of people went rafting in the rain-swollen river. The storm spawned at least two tornadoes in the state. The first, an F1 spawned near Hartwell, demolished two mobile homes, tossed two others, and uprooted several large trees, leaving about $320,000 in property damage. Near Lexington, the other tornado, rated F2, destroyed a two-story wood, 2,500\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (230\u00a0m2) wood-frame dwelling; three boiler homes; and two chicken houses, killing about 30,000\u00a0chickens. A number of pecan trees were uprooted. The tornado left about $700,000 in damage.[19] The outer bands of Beryl spawned 23\u00a0tornadoes in South Carolina, the largest tornado outbreak on record in the state,[23] until the remnants of Hurricane Frances in 2004 produced more twisters.[24] Several of the tornadoes touched down in the vicinity of Lexington. An F3 tornado in the area damaged or destroyed 200\u00a0homes and 40 to 50\u00a0buildings, including a shopping center and five electrical substations, which left approximately 15,000\u00a0people without power. A total of 40\u00a0people were injured by the tornado before it lifted at Lake Murray, after traveling about 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km). Another F3 tornado touched down 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) south of Lexington, where it completely leveled a square stick frame home. Three other tornadoes touched down in Lexington County, one of which \u2013 rated F1 \u2013 overturned a mobile home, causing one serious injury. Outside of Lexington County, a few other tornadoes caused significant damage. A twister that moved along a 2 to 3\u00a0mi (3.2 to 4.8\u00a0km) path through parts of Union, Spartanburg, and Cherokee counties, deroofing a restaurant in Carlisle and damaging several homes and mobile homes, leaving nearly $80,000 in damage in Cowpens.[19] The National Weather Service office in Columbia failed to detect a brief tornado in southwest Richland County after the WSR-88D radar went offline for about 22\u00a0minutes, while the backup WSR-74 radar did not spot the tornado either.[23] Heavy rainfall was observed in some parts of South Carolina with about 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) falling in the mountainous region of the state, including a peak precipitation total of 17.45\u00a0in (443\u00a0mm) near Lake Jocassee.[25] The Saluda River north of Greenville experienced its worst flooding in at least 60\u00a0years, while the Reedy River reached moderate flood stage in Greenville. Several businesses and homes along the Saluda River and its tributaries were flooded or destroyed. Mudslides and flood waters in Oconee County damaged a number of bridges and roadways.[19] Damage in South Carolina reached about $40\u00a0million,[18]  with $37\u00a0million of that total caused by tornadoes and thunderstorm winds.[23] After the storm, then-Governor Carroll A. Campbell Jr. declared a state of emergency for Lexington County due to tornado damage and dispatched 100\u00a0South Carolina National Guard police to the area.[26] The storm produced 5 to 9\u00a0in (130 to 230\u00a0mm) of precipitation in western North Carolina. Flashing flooding and rapidly rising streams forced hundreds of people to evacuate. The French Broad River at Rosman crested at 14.1\u00a0ft (4.3\u00a0m), nearly 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) short of the record height set during Hurricane Hilda in 1964.[27] Floodwaters washed out bridges and roads and resulted the closure of businesses and schools in several counties. Farther east, Guilford County observed 1.28\u00a0in (33\u00a0mm) of rain in only 33\u00a0minutes, flooding numerous roads and causing 11\u00a0car accidents. Several tornadoes were also spawned in the state. The first tornado was an F1 twister that touched down near Earl. It destroyed a mobile home, severely damaged another home, and downed several trees and power lines. An F2 spawned in northern Catawba County near Hickory destroyed two mobile home and another home, damaged several chimneys and roofs, acutely damaged cars and trucks, and overturned a number of trailers. In Iredell County, an F0 tornado damaged six mobile homes, toppled a wall at a home under construction, and knocked over trees and power lines. Another F1 tornado in Harnett County near Buies Creek downed a number of trees and damaged several mobile homes, trapping some people inside.[19]"

A tornado touched down near Martinsville and remained on the ground for about 4.25\u00a0mi (6.84\u00a0km). Throughout its path, the tornado damaged approximately 30\u00a0businesses and 100\u00a0homes, leaving about $8.7\u00a0million in damage. Ten people suffered injuries due to the twister. In West Virginia, 2 to 4\u00a0in (51 to 102\u00a0mm) of rainfall in a short period of time in some areas resulted in street flooding in Morgan and Pendleton. In the latter, two homes washed away. The remnants of Beryl spawned two tornadoes in the state. One tornado mainly left downed trees in Morgan County, while the damaged three homes, destroyed a shed, and uprooted trees in Berkeley County. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl's remnants dropped 3 to 5\u00a0in (76 to 127\u00a0mm) of rainfall in parts of Maryland. Creeks in the region rose to elevated levels, flooding roads, yards, and basements.[19] Heavy rainfall was also recorded in some areas of Pennsylvania. In Bradford County, the worst of the flooding occurred in the western side of the county, especially in areas adjacent to Buck and Bentley creeks. At Wells Township, State Route 549 was washed out and flooding damaged 8\u00a0businesses and 17\u00a0homes. In Waverly, the basement of the Village Hall and annex building were both flooded, damaging village archives and police equipment.

About 150\u00a0people throughout the county fled their homes due to rising water. Most roads in the county were flooded, including U.S. routes 6 and 15. A 0.5\u00a0mi (0.80\u00a0km) section of State Route 549 near Daggett was washed out, while two bridges along State Route 328 were damaged. An automotive dealership in Richmond Township suffered about $500,000 in losses after 60 cars were destroyed or severely damaged. A house burned down in Middlebury Township after flooding forced fire fighters to take 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) worth of detours. In Clinton County, a few roads were closed due to flooding, while State Route 144 was shut down south of Renovo because of mudslides. Two boys were rescued from Kettle Creek. Similar flooding occurred in Union County. Along the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County, 15 to 20\u00a0farms were flooded, with an estimated $75,000 in damage to crops.

        "content": " The 1995 India cyclone was a tropical cyclone that struck southeastern India which later spawned a rare snowstorm in Nepal, triggering the deadliest mountain trekking incident in the country's history in November 1995. The storm originated from the monsoon trough on November\u00a07 in the Bay of Bengal, east of India, becoming the penultimate storm of the 1995 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. Moving northwestward, the system gradually intensified while moving toward land, eventually developing an eye in the middle of the convection. Reaching peak winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a very severe cyclonic storm on November\u00a08,[nb 1] in line with intensity estimates from the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).[nb 2] On November\u00a09, the cyclone made landfall near the border of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. A typical for most November storms, the system continued to the north and dissipated over Nepal on November\u00a011. In India, the cyclone's strong winds were accompanied by heavy rainfall and a storm surge of 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft) that inundated the coastline several hundred feet inland. Power lines, crops, and houses were damaged, and many boats were damaged, causing several nautical fatalities. The cyclone killed at least 128\u00a0people in India, with hundreds remaining unaccounted for, and damage was estimated at RS$1.1\u00a0billion (US$32.2\u00a0million). In neighboring Bangladesh, high waves killed 45\u00a0people after sinking or sweeping away four ships. The cyclone later spawned a rare November snowstorm across eastern Nepal, with depths reaching 2,000\u00a0mm (79\u00a0in). The snowfall occurred without warning amid the busy mountain trekking season, and there were several avalanches and landslides across the country. One such incident killed 24\u00a0people at a lodge near Gokyo, and there were 63\u00a0deaths related to the cyclone in the country. The Nepal government launched the largest search and rescue mission in the country's history, rescuing 450\u00a0people, some of whom trapped for days in the snow."

A disturbance near the Andaman Islands became the focus of the overall system on November\u00a06. Located south of the subtropical ridge, the system moved to the west-northwest.[3] Based on the improved organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late on November\u00a06, and at 00:00\u00a0UTC the next day initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 03B just west of the Andaman Islands.[4] Six hours later, the IMD likewise classified the system as a depression.[5] After development, the depression steadily intensified while moving through the Bay of Bengal; rounding the ridge, it accelerated and turned more to the northwest. The IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression by 12:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a07, and further to a cyclonic storm by 00:00\u00a0UTC on the following day. The convection, or thunderstorms, organized into a comma-like structure, which further evolved into a central dense overcast.[5] Intensification was also aided by increased upper-level divergence or the increased upward movement of air.[3] At 09:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a08, the IMD upgraded the system to a severe cyclonic storm, and six hours later to a very severe cyclonic storm. By that time, an eye had developed, described by the IMD as a \"banding-type eye\". As such, the agency estimated peak 3\u00a0minutes sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). The minimum barometric pressure was estimated at 978\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg).[5] The JTWC estimated slightly higher 1-minute winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[4] Around 05:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a09, the cyclone made landfall at peak intensity in eastern India, near the state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, and close to the city of Ichchapuram. Although the IMD officially estimated peak winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), winds could have been as high as 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph), based on the damage and estimates from the Dvorak technique. After moving ashore, the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land.[5] By 12:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a09, the JTWC discontinued advisories.[4] The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November\u00a010. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant low,[5] by which time the system had turned to the northeast and spread into Nepal. The circulation dissipated, although moisture and convection from the storm spread through Nepal.[4]"

Winds in Gopalpur, Odisha were estimated at 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). The lowest barometric pressure in India was 982.1\u00a0mbar (29.00\u00a0inHg) in Kalingapatnam. The storm produced a storm surge of 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft), which spread several hundred feet inland. In addition to the winds and surge, the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall along its path, particularly in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, peaking at over 200\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in).[5] Along the Indian coast from Andhra Pradesh to West Bengal, 2,688\u00a0boats were damaged, accounting for 48\u00a0fishermen deaths in Visakhapatnam alone.[5] An Indian Coast Guard ship was washed ashore near Bhubaneswar, trapping the crew inside until they were rescued.[6] In Andhra Pradesh, the high winds damaged 21\u00a0km (13\u00a0mi) of power lines, affecting 12,733\u00a0electrical units. The storm damaged 27,945\u00a0houses, mostly in Orissa.[5] In the state, the storm's high winds and rainfall wrecked stalls for a festival in Paradip, and raining out two days play of a Test cricket match in Cuttack between India and New Zealand.[7][6] There was also widespread crop damage on 11,043,653\u00a0ha (27,289,460 acres) of crop fields. In West Bengal, paddy crops, mustard trees, and potatoes were damaged. Throughout India, the cyclone killed 73\u00a0people, with 402\u00a0people missing after the storm.[5] The International Disaster Database indicated that the storm killed 128\u00a0people and caused US$46.3\u00a0million in damage.[8] Farther east, officials in Bangladesh evacuated residents along offshore islands, while boats were ordered to return to the coast.[9] The storm ultimately produced 60 to 80\u00a0km/h (37 to 50\u00a0mph) winds along with heavy rainfall in the country.[10] High seas, reaching 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) in height, capsized a boat in the Chunkuri River and left three other boats missing, killing 45\u00a0people.[11] The waves also flooded about 3,000\u00a0ha (7,400 acres) of crop fields.[12] Atypical for November, the storm continued northward and became the most intense cyclone to affect Nepal in the autumn in 50\u00a0years. The country's Department of Meteorology did not issue warnings for the storm,[13] as no mountain trekking teams requested a forecast.[14] As a result, many mountain climbers and guides were caught off guard,[15] and thousands of mountaineers from around the world were in the region when the cyclone struck.[14] When the energy from the storm spread into the Himalayan Mountains of Nepal,[4] a process known as orographic lift occurred, whereby the moisture coalesced in mountainous regions. At elevations generally below 3,500\u00a0m (11,500\u00a0ft), the precipitation resulted in 50 to 200\u00a0mm (2.0 to 7.9\u00a0in) of rainfall, reaching 220\u00a0mm (8.7\u00a0in) in Dhankuta. In some areas, totals were 3,000% of the average November rainfall, which is usually a dry month.[13] At higher elevations, the precipitation caused intense snowfall, reaching up to 2,000\u00a0mm (79\u00a0in) deep in Dingboche.[13] Gorakshep recorded 1,200\u00a0mm (47\u00a0in) of snowfall.[16] The Khumbu region of eastern Nepal received rare snowfall, as it is normally part of a rain shadow. The village of Thame was buried for eight days until people could travel freely again; the rarity of the snowfall meant that residents did not have skis or snow shoes. By November\u00a014, or five days after the arrival of the storm, the snow had receded.[13] The heavy snowfall across Nepal produced landslides and avalanches,[4] mostly on November\u00a010 and into the following day. Near Gokyo, two avalanches combined and destroyed a lodge housing 25\u00a0mountain climbers, killing all but one; the survivor was rescued after being trapped for 40\u00a0hours.[13] The hikers were climbing Gokyo Ri, a mountain 18\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) southeast of Mount Everest.[17] This marked the deadliest avalanche in Nepal to affect a hiking expedition.[18] Another avalanche killed seven people in Kangchenjunga.[13] With levels reaching as high as the roofs of houses,[18] the heavy snowfall damaged the roofs of several buildings, including one school, and killed about 100\u00a0animals. Across the country, the storm killed 63\u00a0people, 33 of them related to avalanches,[13] including 22\u00a0foreigners,[16] although the Trekking Workers' Association believed the death toll was higher.[13] Several of the deaths were the result of collapsed houses,[15] while others were the result of people freezing to death.[16] The Mani Rimdu festival likely prevented additional deaths, as over 1,000\u00a0residents in the hardest hit areas left for the ceremony. After the snowfall, the Nepal government coordinated the largest search and rescue mission in the country's history, utilizing helicopters to rescue 450\u00a0stranded people,[13] encompassing an area of 600\u00a0km2 (230\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), before the mission was ended on November\u00a015.[14] Several of the rescued people required medical attention.[13] Stranded victims had to stay in the snow for a day and a half before being spotted and rescued,[19] and inclement weather disrupted efforts.[15]"

Although hurricane season typically encompasses a much larger time-span, actual activity was confined to the middle of September. The only tropical cyclone of the year developed in the region of The Bahamas on September 15 and drifted northwestward, moving inland over Florida and Georgia. Thorough warnings before the storm prevented any major damage. The 1914 season is one of only two that did not produce any hurricanes (the other being the 1907 season). Due to the lack of modern technology such as satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and an additional tropical depression may have existed in late October."

        "content": "With only one official tropical cyclone, the 1914 season was the least active tropical cyclone season on record. It is one of only two Atlantic seasons without a storm of hurricane intensity (winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) or stronger),[1] the other being the 1907 season.[2] The sole tropical storm's formation on September 14 represents the latest start to a hurricane season since official records began in 1851.[3] Information on the 1914 season is chiefly based on data from the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), which undertook a thorough reanalysis of hurricanes from 1911 through 1914 in 2005. Several changes, mostly of a minor nature, were made to the September tropical storm. Additionally, two other systems during the year were formally considered for inclusion into the hurricane database; one of them was deemed a potential tropical depression, but considered too weak to be classified a tropical storm. The other was assessed as a non-tropical system. The 2005 HURDAT reanalysis relied largely on historical weather maps and ship reports in place of modern technology, including satellite imagery.[1] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 3, the lowest since official records began in 1851 and far below the 1911\u20131920 average of 58.7.[4][5] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[4]"

        "content": "The first and only tropical storm of the season originated in a westward-moving tropical wave denoted on weather maps from September 13. Decreases in air pressure occurred throughout the Bahamas, providing \"strong indications of a disturbance\".[6] The system became a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on September 15, approximately 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) east of Miami, Florida. It strengthened into a tropical storm about 12 hours later,[2] leading to the issuance of storm warnings from the east coast of Florida to as far north as Hatteras, North Carolina.[6] The system drifted northwest while gradually intensifying, and was situated south of the Georgia coast late on September 16. While most tropical systems in the vicinity tend to continue northward along the Eastern Seaboard, the cyclone curved westward and moved ashore near the Florida\u2013Georgia state border after achieving a peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[2][6] It progressed inland over southern Georgia as it quickly weakened, but its intensity leveled off after around 18:00 UTC on September 17. The storm skirted the northern Gulf of Mexico as it swerved slightly south of due west, weakening to a tropical depression over southeastern Louisiana.[2] By early September 19, the depression had further deteriorated into an open trough\u2014a poorly defined, elongated area of low pressure.[1] The storm produced widespread rainfall in the Southeastern United States, accompanied by gale-force winds along the coast, and ships reported severe conditions at sea. High tides occurred around St. Augustine, Florida, washing over the South Street Causeway. Winds from the storm dispersed large amounts of dead grass from marshes in the area. No significant damage was reported due to thorough warnings before the cyclone. A 2005 reanalysis of the storm made some minor changes to its listing in the official hurricane database, setting back the time of formation and raising the peak intensity.[1]"

        "content": "In addition to the September tropical storm, a possible depression that remained below tropical storm intensity developed in late October. On October 24, a broad area of low pressure was present over the western Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. A possible center of low pressure, attached to a cold front extending southward, had formed within the larger system and moved toward the east. Another center of low pressure formed in the northwestern Caribbean on October 25 and is considered a tropical depression in contemporary research. The depression had weak winds due to the light pressure gradient in the region and, at its peak, it had a minimum central pressure of 1,004\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg). On October 26, the cold front associated with the extratropical cyclone to the north absorbed the tropical system. The next day, the extratropical system deteriorated into an open trough. Although the tropical low was reviewed for inclusion into the hurricane database as a tropical storm in 2005, it was deemed too weak.[1]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Allison was a tropical storm that devastated southeast Texas in June of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. An arguable example of the \"brown ocean effect\", Allison lasted unusually long for a June storm, remaining tropical or subtropical for 16 days, most of which was when the storm was over land dumping torrential rainfall. The storm developed from a tropical wave in the northern Gulf of Mexico on June 4, 2001, and struck the upper Texas coast shortly thereafter. It drifted northward through the state, turned back to the south, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm continued to the east-northeast, made landfall on Louisiana, then moved across the southeast United States and Mid-Atlantic. Allison was the first storm since Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 to strike the northern Texas coastline.[1] The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at over 40 inches (1,000\u00a0mm) in Texas. The worst flooding occurred in Houston, where most of Allison's damage occurred: 30,000 became homeless after the storm flooded over 70,000\u00a0houses and destroyed 2,744\u00a0homes. Downtown Houston was inundated with flooding, causing severe damage to hospitals and businesses. Twenty-three people died in Texas. Along its entire path, Allison caused $9\u00a0billion (2001\u00a0USD, equivalent to $14.8\u00a0billion in 2023)[2] in damage and 41 deaths. Aside from Texas, the places worst hit were Louisiana and southeastern Pennsylvania. Following the storm, President George W. Bush designated 75 counties along Allison's path as disaster areas, which enabled the citizens affected to apply for aid. Then the fourth-costliest Atlantic tropical cyclone and still the costliest Atlantic tropical cyclone that was never a major hurricane, Allison was the first Atlantic tropical storm to have its name retired without ever having reached hurricane strength, and the only until Tropical Storm Erika in 2015."

        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on May 21, 2001. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, retaining little convection on its way. After moving across South America and the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the wave entered the eastern North Pacific Ocean on June 1. A low-level circulation developed on June 2, while it was about 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland on June 3. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on June 4, and developed deep convection on its eastern side.[3] Early on June 5, satellite imagery suggested that a tropical depression was forming in the northwest Gulf of Mexico, which was furthered by reports of wind gusts as high as 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) just a few hundred feet above the surface, towards the east side of the system.[4] At 1200\u00a0UTC on June 5, the disturbance developed a broad, low-level circulation, and was classified as Tropical Storm Allison, the first storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. Some intensification was projected, though it was expected to be hindered by cool offshore sea surface temperatures.[5] Due to the cold-core nature of the center, Allison initially contained subtropical characteristics. Despite this, the storm quickly strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), with tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) east of the center, and a minimum central pressure of 1,000\u00a0mbar (29.53\u00a0inHg).[3] The storm initially moved very little, and the presence of several small vortices from within the deep convection caused difficulty in determining the exact center location.[6] Later in the day, several different track forecasts arose. One scenario had the cyclone tracking westward into Mexico. Another projected the storm moving east towards southern Louisiana. At the time, it was noted that little rain or wind persisted near the center, but rather to the north and east.[7] Under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge that extended in an east\u2013west orientation across the southeast United States,[6] Allison weakened while nearing the Texas coastline, and struck near Freeport, Texas with 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) winds.[3] Inland, the storm rapidly weakened, and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on June 6.[8] Shortly after being downgraded to a tropical depression, surface observations showed an elongated circulation with a poorly defined center, which had reformed closer to the deep convection.[9] The depression drifted northward until reaching Lufkin, Texas, where it stalled due to a high pressure system to its north.[3]  While stalling over Texas, the storm dropped excessive rainfall, peaking at just over 40 inches (1,000\u00a0mm) in northwestern Jefferson County.[10]  On June 7, the subtropical ridge off Florida weakened, while the ridge west of Texas intensified. This steered Tropical Depression Allison to make a clockwise loop, and the storm began drifting to the southwest. As the center reached Huntsville, Texas, a heavy rain band began to back build from Louisiana westward into Liberty County, Texas, which had caused additional flooding.[11] At the time, the system had a minimum central pressure of about 1,004\u00a0mbar (29.65\u00a0inHg) and maximum sustained winds of about 10\u00a0mph (16\u00a0km/h).[12] Late on June 9 and early on June 10, Allison's remnants reentered reached the Gulf of Mexico and emerged over open waters.[13] The low once again became nearly stationary about 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) south of Galveston, Texas, and despite more favorable upper-level winds, it showed no signs of redevelopment.[14] Due to dry air and moderate westerly wind shear, the storm transformed into a subtropical cyclone. While the subtropical depression moved eastward, a new low level circulation redeveloped to the east, and Allison quickly made landfall on Morgan City, Louisiana on June 11.[3] At around the same time, the surface center reformed to the east-northeast of its previous location, aligning with the mid-level circulation.[15] Strong thunderstorms redeveloped over the circulation, and Allison strengthened into a subtropical storm over southeastern Louisiana.[3] The storm intensified further to attain sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of about 1,000\u00a0mbar (29.53\u00a0inHg) near Mclain, Mississippi, accompanied by a well-defined eye-like feature.[16] The storm was officially downgraded to a subtropical depression at 0000\u00a0UTC on June 12. Somewhat accelerating, the depression tracked to the east-northeast through Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina before becoming nearly stationary near Wilmington, North Carolina.[3] The depression drifted through North Carolina and sped to the northeast for a time in response to an approaching cold front.[17] Though satellite and radar imagery show the system was well-organized, the system slowed and moved erratically for a period of time,[18] executing what appeared to be a small counterclockwise loop.[19] The storm began tracking in a generally northeasterly direction, and crossed into the southern Delmarva Peninsula on June 16.[20] The subtropical remnants reached the Atlantic on June 17, and while located east of Atlantic City, New Jersey, winds began to restrengthen, and heavy rains formed to the north of the circulation. The low was interacting with a frontal boundary, and started merging with it, as it accelerated to the northeast at 13\u00a0mph (21\u00a0km/h).[21] The remnants of Allison briefly reintensified to a subtropical storm through baroclinic processes, though it became extratropical while south of Long Island.[3] By later on June 17, the low was situated off the coast of Rhode Island, spreading a swath of precipitation over New England.[22] The remnants of the tropical storm were then absorbed by the frontal boundary by June 18, and eventually passed south of Cape Race, Newfoundland on June 20, where the extratropical cyclone dissipated.[3]"

Combined with waves on top, areas of Galveston Island experienced a wall of water 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) in height, creating overwash along the coastline. The storm caused winds of up to 43\u00a0mph (69\u00a0km/h) at the Galveston Pier. While Allison was stalling over Texas, it dropped heavy rainfall across the state, including 9.77 inches (248\u00a0mm) in Galveston, 12.13 inches (308\u00a0mm) in Jamaica Beach, Texas, and other similar totals along the coast.[3] Minimal beach erosion was reported,[30] and impact was minimal near the coast.[31] While moving northward through Texas as a minimal tropical depression, Allison produced minor wind gusts.[3] Shortly after making landfall, the storm spawned a tornado in Manvel of Brazoria County, causing damage to one home.[31] Within hours of making landfall, rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches (200 to 300 millimetres) were common in Galveston and Harris County. Flash flooding continued for days,[11] with rainfall amounts across the state peaking at just over 40 inches (1,000\u00a0mm) in northwestern Jefferson County. In the Port of Houston, a total of 36.99 inches (940\u00a0mm) was reported.[32] Houston experienced torrential rainfall in a short amount of time. The six-day rainfall in Houston amounted to 38.6 inches (980\u00a0mm).[33] Houston Hobby Airport received 20.84 inches (529\u00a0mm) of rain from June 5 to 10, 2001, while Bush Intercontinental Airport received 16.48 inches (419\u00a0mm).[34] Two-thirds of the bayous and creeks in Harris County experienced 500-year flood events. Houston Intercontinental Airport, which typically receives 46.07 inches (1,170\u00a0mm) of rain in a year, experienced 35.7% of its expected total in the first nine days of June.[1] The deluge flooded 95,000\u00a0automobiles and 73,000\u00a0houses throughout Harris County.[1] Tropical Storm Allison destroyed 2,744\u00a0homes, leaving 30,000\u00a0homeless with residential damages totaling to $1.76\u00a0billion (2001\u00a0USD). Residential neighborhoods inside and to the north of Interstate 610 were hardest hit.[33] Additionally, five of the six bayou systems in downtown Houston were severely flooded.[35] Four of them broke 100-year high-water records, causing excessive surface run-off.[33] Several hospitals in the Texas Medical Center, the largest medical complex in the world, experienced severe damage from the storm, which hit quickly and with unexpected fury on a Friday evening. Hospital personnel were forced to evacuate thousands of patients in a major effort that included Coast Guard and Army helicopters. Many of the hospitals had lost all power, including back-up generators, meaning that patients had to be carried down dark stairwells by the staff in temperatures over 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C). Patients who could not breathe on their own had to be continuously manually ventilated during the evacuation, which lasted hours. Most hospitals lost power and backup power when basements, the area where power and research data were kept, flooded. The Baylor College of Medicine experienced major damage, totaling $495\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD). The medical school lost 90,000\u00a0research animals, 60,000\u00a0tumor samples, and 25\u00a0years of research data. The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, across the street, lost thousands of laboratory animals, including expensive genetic-specific mice. Decades of research was lost, including, for many scientists, their life's work. The UT-Houston gross anatomy lab, cyclotron, and other important facilities were completely destroyed. Throughout the Medical Center, damage totaled to over $2\u00a0billion (2001\u00a0USD). Most were reopened after a month, though it took much longer to become fully operational.[33] The storm flooded the lower level of the massive law library at the University of Houston Law Center with eight feet of water. An estimated 174,000 books and the microfiche collection were destroyed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) gave $21.4 million to rebuild the law library collection.[36][37] The tunnel system, which connects most large office buildings in downtown Houston, was submerged, as were many streets and parking garages adjacent to Buffalo Bayou. In the Houston Theater District, also near Buffalo Bayou in the northern part of downtown, the Houston Ballet, Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and Alley Theater lost millions of dollars' worth of costumes, musical instruments, sheet music, archives, props, and other artifacts.[33] The tunnel system, which connects most large office buildings in downtown Houston, was submerged, as were many streets and parking garages adjacent to Buffalo Bayou. At the Houston Theater District, also in downtown, the Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and Alley Theater lost millions of dollars of costumes, musical instruments, sheet music, archives and other artifacts. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground.[33] Local television stations ran all-night coverage of the deluge from June 8 through the next day, including KHOU-TV 11, which was forced to transmit its broadcast to a satellite truck when floodwaters entered its production studio on the Allen Parkway near Studemont/Montrose, near downtown along the banks of Buffalo Bayou. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water,[38] forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground. Eighteen-wheeled trucks were filmed floating down major freeways and highways, swept along by floodwaters.[33]"

Rainfall totals peaked at 29.86 inches (758\u00a0mm) in Thibodaux, the highest rainfall total in Louisiana from a tropical cyclone since another Tropical Storm Allison in 1989.[40] Most of the southeastern portion of the state experienced over 10\u00a0inches of rain (255\u00a0mm).[10] Winds were generally light, peaking at 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h) sustained in Lakefront with gusts to 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) in Bay Gardene. The storm produced a storm surge of 2.5 feet (0.76\u00a0m) in Cameron as it was making landfall in Texas.[3] While moving northward through Texas, the outer bands of the storm produced an F1 tornado near Zachary, damaging several trees and a power line. A man was killed when a damaged power line hit his truck.[41] When Allison first made landfall, heavy rainfall flooded numerous houses and businesses. Minor wind gusts caused minor roof damage to 10\u00a0houses in Cameron Parish, while its storm surge flooded portions of Louisiana Highway 82.[42] When the system returned, more rainfall occurred, flooding over 1,000\u00a0houses in St. Tammany Parish,[43] 80 houses in St. Bernard Parish,[44] and hundreds of houses elsewhere in the state. The flooding also forced 1,800\u00a0residents from their homes in East Baton Rouge Parish.[45] The deluge left numerous roads impassable, while runoff resulted in severe river flooding. The Bogue Falaya River in Covington crested past its peak twice to near-record levels.[43] The Amite and Comite Rivers reached their highest levels since 1983. In addition, the levee along the Bayou Manchac broke, flooding roadways and more houses.[45] Damage in Louisiana totaled to $65\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $84\u00a0million 2012\u00a0USD).[33]"

The currents prompted sirens, which are normally used for storm warnings, to be activated in Pensacola Beach.[52] The rip currents killed 5 off the coast of Florida.[53] Outer rain bands from the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the Florida Panhandle of over 11 inches (280\u00a0mm) in one day. The Tallahassee Regional Airport recorded 10.13 inches (257\u00a0mm) in 24\u00a0hours, breaking the old 24\u2011hour record set in 1969.[54] Throughout the state, Allison destroyed 10\u00a0homes and damaged 599, 196 severely, primarily in Leon County.[55] Including the deaths from rip currents, Allison killed eight people in Florida[3] and caused $20\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $26\u00a0million 2012\u00a0USD) in damage.[54] Over Georgia, the storm dropped heavy rainfall of 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) in 24\u00a0hours in various locations. The deluge caused rivers to crest past their banks, including the Oconee River at Milledgeville which peaked at 33.7 feet (10.3\u00a0m). The rainfall, which was heaviest across the southwestern portion of the state, washed out several bridges and roads, and flooded many other roads. Georgia governor Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency for seven counties in the state.[56] The storm also spawned two tornadoes.[3] In South Carolina, Allison's outer bands produced 10\u00a0tornadoes[3] and several funnel clouds, though most only caused minor damage limited to a damaged courthouse, snapped trees[57] and downed power lines.[58] Allison produced from 12 to 16 inches (300 to 410 millimetres) of rainfall in North Carolina, closing nearly all roads in Martin County and damaging 25\u00a0homes.[59] The severe flooding washed out a bridge in eastern Halifax County[60] and flooded numerous cars.[40] Wet roads caused nine traffic accidents throughout the state.[3]"

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also provided 75% for the cost of debris removal, emergency services related to the disaster, and repairing or replacing damaged public facilities, such as roads, bridges and utilities.[71] A few weeks after Allison, FEMA opened six disaster recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance.[76] The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48\u00a0shelters at the peak of need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000\u00a0meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the Houston Police Academy. The National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500\u00a0people.[77] The team of 87\u00a0medical personnel served over 1,000\u00a0patients within two weeks of Allison's passage.[78] Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses.[79] After nearly 50,000\u00a0cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car's history.[80] Many people took advantage of the flood victims, including fraudulent contractors and suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified.[81] Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem.[82] By six months after the storm, around 120,000 Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05\u00a0billion (2001\u00a0USD).[83] Like in Texas, a mosquito outbreak occurred in Louisiana. Only pesticides acceptable to the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Fish and Wildlife Service were allowed to be used.[84] FEMA officials warned homeowners of the dangers of floodwaters, including mold, mildew, and bacteria.[85] By three months after the storm, just under 100,000 Louisiana citizens applied for federal aid, totaling to over $110\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $143\u00a0million 2012\u00a0USD). $25\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $32\u00a0million 2012\u00a0USD) of the total was for business loans, while an additional $8\u00a0million was for public assistance for communities and state agencies.[86] More than 750 flood victims in Florida applied for governmental aid, totaling to $1.29\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $1.5\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD).[87] In Pennsylvania, 1,670 flood victims applied for federal aid, totaling to $11.5\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $14.3\u00a0million 2012\u00a0USD). $3.4\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $4.4\u00a0million 2012\u00a0USD) of the total was to replace a SEPTA rail bridge over Sandy Run in Fort Washington.[88]"

        "content": " Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Yaas (Arabic pronunciation: [ja\u0294as][a]) was a relatively strong and very damaging tropical cyclone that made landfall in Odisha and brought significant impacts to West Bengal during late May 2021. The second cyclonic storm, second severe cyclonic storm, and second very severe cyclonic storm of the 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Yaas formed from a tropical disturbance that the Indian Meteorological Department first monitored on May 23. Conditions in the basin favored development as the system became a deep depression later that day, before intensifying into a cyclonic storm on the next day, receiving the name Yaas. The system further intensified as it turned to the northeast, becoming a severe cyclonic storm on May 24 despite moderate wind shear. Marginally favorable conditions further continued as Yaas accelerated northeastward, strengthening to a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone and to a very severe cyclonic storm on May 25. Yaas crossed the northern Odisha coast around 20\u00a0km south of Balasore at its peak intensity as a very severe cyclonic storm on May 26. Upon landfall, the JTWC and IMD issued their final advisories as Yaas further weakened inland while turning north-northwestwards. In preparations for the storm, many electrical companies in West Bengal and Odisha prepared additional generators and transformers for possible electrical problems. Evacuations were also ordered, starting on May 24 on low-lying areas in East Midnapore and West Midnapore and Jhargram. Hooghly, Kolkata and North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas are now placed on high alert.[3] Railway operations and marine activities were halted due to Yaas, while rescue authorities and medical teams were deployed in for possible emergencies. In Bangladesh, over two million individuals were ordered to be evacuated in coastal areas of the country due to the storm's approach. Food supplies and emergency funds were also released for the evacuees. 20 people across India and Bangladesh died due to Yaas.[4] West Bengal was the hardest hit Indian state, with an estimated loss of \u20b9210\u00a0billion (US$2.89\u00a0billion).[5] Odisha also suffered a loss of \u20b96.1\u00a0billion (US$83.9\u00a0million).[6]"

On the next day, at 09:30\u00a0UTC, the disturbance intensified into a depression and was assigned the designation BOB 02 by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).[7] Meanwhile, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 15:00\u00a0UTC on May 22 on the developing system.[8] The system subsequently intensified into a deep depression at 15:00\u00a0UTC on May 23.[9] On the following day, at 02:30\u00a0UTC, the system further intensified into a cyclonic storm and was given the name Yaas by the IMD.[10] At that time, the low-level circulation center of the system became partially-exposed due to moderate wind shear; however, large masses of rainbands persisted in the southern portion of the storm as it remained in a marginally favorable environment for intensification, with warm sea surface temperatures and good outflow but moderate wind shear.[11][12] The IMD further upgraded Yaas to a severe cyclonic storm at 18:00 UTC that day as the system became more organized.[13] A subtropical ridge turned the system northeast into an area of low wind shear, causing Yaas to gradually strengthen.[12] At 12:00 UTC on May 25, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 system as the system further organized.[14] Despite Yaas being negatively affected after making landfall, combined with the weakening effects of moderate wind shear and poor outflow, it intensified further to a very severe cyclonic storm at 15:00 UTC on May 25 as it featured a profound convection.[15] The storm subsequently reached its peak intensity of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) in three-minute sustained wind speeds, according to the IMD; the JTWC had slightly lower estimates of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) on the system.[15][16] Around 09:00 IST (03:30 UTC) on May 26, Yaas made landfall north of Dhamra Port and south of Bahanaga at the same intensity.[17] Upon moving inland, the JTWC issued their final warning on the storm as it weakened to a tropical storm since it was over land and also faced increased vertical shear.[18] Soon afterward, the IMD also discontinued advisories as the system became disorganized and as it weakened to a deep depression.[19] Yaas eventually dissipated in northern India on May 28."

He said a field survey would be conducted later on.[78] Modi announced \u20b910\u00a0billion (US$138\u00a0million) in immediate relief split between Odisha, West Bengal, and Jharkhand on May 28. Modi undertook aerial surveys of impacted areas in the Bhadrak and Balasore districts of Odisha, as well as Purba Medinipur district in West Bengal as well.[79] Earlier on May 27, Modi had held a review meeting with Odisha's Chief Minister, Naveen Patnaik. Discussing the impact of the cyclone, Odisha's government had demanded long-term solutions to problems that were caused by repeated cyclone effects, and provision of disaster-resilient power systems. However, there were no immediate funds for this.[78] Those displaced by Yaas had sought refuge in overcrowded shelters; this caused increased concern about COVID-19 outbreaks in an already terrible pandemic in India. WASH items were in limited availability, and shelter camps and WASH facilities were flooded by the storm. Critical demands for the resources were being sent through the IAG network for primary health services; this prompted the need for immediate availability of these items. Children, women, the elderly, and other groups of notable vulnerability were of high concern due to the lack of basic supplies. Psychosocial support and recreational activities for sheltering youth was also required."

        "content": " Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Tauktae (Burmese pronunciation: [ta\u028a\u0294t\u025b\u0330][a]) was a powerful, deadly and damaging tropical cyclone in the Arabian Sea that became the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Indian state of Gujarat since the 1998 Gujarat cyclone[2] and one of the strongest tropical cyclones to ever affect the west coast of India and above all It was the strongest storm of 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. The second depression, first cyclonic storm, first severe cyclonic storm, first very severe cyclonic storm, and first extremely severe cyclonic storm of the 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Tauktae originated from an area of low pressure in the Arabian Sea, which was first monitored by the India Meteorological Department on May 13. The low drifted eastward and organized into a deep depression by May 14. The storm soon took a northward turn, continuing to gradually intensify because of warm waters near the coast, and the system strengthened into a cyclonic storm and was named Tauktae later that same day. Tauktae continued intensifying into May 15, reaching severe cyclonic storm status later that day. Tauktae began to parallel the coast of the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra, before rapidly intensifying into a very severe cyclonic storm, early on May 16. Early on May 17, Tauktae intensified into an extremely severe cyclonic storm, reaching its peak intensity soon afterward. Later that same day, Tauktae underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and weakened, before restrengthening as it neared the coast of Gujarat, making landfall soon afterward. After making landfall, Tauktae gradually weakened as it slowly turned northeastward, moving further inland. On May 19, Tauktae weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area.\nTauktae brought heavy rainfall and flash floods to areas along the coast of Kerala and on Lakshadweep. There were reports of heavy rain in the states of Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra as well.[3] Tauktae resulted in at least 169 deaths in India,[4][5][6][7][8] and left another 81 people missing.[9] There were also 5 deaths reported in Pakistan.[10] The storm displaced over 200,000 people in Gujarat.[11][12] The cyclone also caused widespread infrastructure and agricultural damage to the western coast of India. Upwards of 40 fishermen were lost at sea when their boats were caught in the cyclone. Mumbai also experienced the impact of the storm, with airports being closed for safety reasons. The city experienced their highest ever recorded wind gust at 114\u00a0km/h (71\u00a0mph).[13] Power outages and other electrical problems also prevailed in the impacted regions. The cyclone made landfall in Gujarat the same day as India recorded its, at the time, highest single-day COVID-19 death toll, with 4,329 deaths reported.[14] The cyclone also caused a large amount of maritime incidents as it moved along the coast of western India. Hundreds were missing from various barges; however, most of them have been rescued.[14] Other larger ships also experienced problems, such as structure or power losses. At least 174 people have been killed by the storm, with over 80 still missing. Losses from Tauktae were calculated at \u20b9115\u00a0billion or US$1.57\u00a0billion.[15][16][17][18]"

        "content": "On May 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a large area of low pressure in the equatorial Arabian Sea for potential tropical cyclone development. As the system slowly moved eastwards, it gradually organized amid favorable conditions, including sea surface temperatures of up to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86 degrees Fahrenheit) and low wind shear. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on this system on May 13.[19][20] A few hours later, the JTWC designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01A.[21] The system gradually intensified, as the previously disorganized broad area of convection began to wrap around the low-level circulation center. It further strengthened to become a deep depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC the next day.[22] Around this time, the system turned northeastwards and began to move towards India. Due to the very large area of convection over the cyclone, it dumped heavy rainfall over the southern portions of the country. Six hours after the upgrade, the system became even more organized and intensified into a cyclonic storm, receiving the name Tauktae by the IMD.[23] Tauktae later intensified into a Severe Cyclonic Storm at 15:00\u00a0UTC on May 15, as a robust central dense overcast developed.[24] Just three hours later, the JTWC upgraded Tauktae to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale (SSHWS), while a ragged eye appeared on infrared satellite imagery as the storm started a period of rapid intensification.[25] Early the next day, the cyclone turned northward, paralleling the west coast of India. Amid the favorable conditions stated earlier, the storm rapidly intensified, and at 06:00\u00a0UTC that day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a Category 2 tropical cyclone.[26] By 09:00\u00a0UTC, the cyclone had developed a well-defined, but ragged eye, according to INSAT imagery,[27] and the JTWC upgraded Tauktae to a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone, as rapid intensification continued. Despite this period of strengthening, the eye of the storm degraded for a while, according to INSAT imagery.[28] Later, the storm continued intensifying, and at 03:00\u00a0UTC on May 17 Tauktae reached its peak intensity as an extremely severe cyclonic storm, with maximum 3-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph),[29] maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 950 millibars (28\u00a0inHg),[29] making the storm the equivalent of a Category\u00a04 tropical cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Soon afterward, Tauktae initiated an eyewall replacement cycle, which started to weaken the storm.[30] As the storm neared the coast of Gujarat, Tauktae completed its eyewall replacement cycle and began to reorganize, as a new eye became visible on satellite imagery, and the cloud top temperatures dropped in the central dense overcast (CDO) region. At 8:30\u00a0p.m. local time (IST), the cyclone made landfall near Una in Gujarat.[31][32] Soon afterward, the JTWC issued their final warning on the system. In the advisory, the agency estimated Tauktae's 1-minute sustained winds at landfall to be 125\u00a0mph (205 kilometres per hour), making Tauktae the equivalent of a high-end Category\u00a03 tropical cyclone, making it the strongest storm to make landfall in Gujarat since reliable records began, surpassing the record set by 1998 Gujarat cyclone.[33] Afterward, due to land interaction, the storm began to weaken slowly; the Brown ocean effect from the Gulf of Kutch and Gulf of Khambhat caused the storm to weaken at a slower pace than usual. By 11:30\u00a0a.m. local time (IST), the storm had weakened below severe cyclonic storm intensity, before weakening below cyclonic storm intensity twelve hours later, after traversing the rugged terrain of the Aravalli range, bringing heavy rainfall and wind gusts to the region of North India. At 14:00\u00a0UTC on May 19, Tauktae weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area over Rajasthan and adjoining Madhya Pradesh, and the IMD issued their final bulletin on the storm.[34]"

Bandra Worli Sea Link was also closed for normal traffic and the COVID-19 vaccination drive in Mumbai was also suspended for the day.[48] On May 16, the number of people evacuated quickly grew to tens of thousands of people as Tauktae neared the Gujarati coast. The IMD said tidal waves of up to nine feet were expected in the area. Government officials of the Indian state said that over 150,000 people were to be evacuated from vulnerable areas on Sunday evening. All fishing was suspended until Monday near the Gujarat coast. More than 170 mobile intensive care unit vans were deployed to help prevent the possibility of the current surge in COVID-19 cases being worsened. Hospitals windproofed their buildings to prevent damage.[49] The Navy was placed on standby in Gujarat. The army was also reported to be continuously watching Tauktae. At this time, 180 relief and rescue teams and 9 ETFs were also on standby.[13] The IMD warned of coastal flooding caused by storm surge of up to 13 feet. Ahmedabad, Gujarat's most populous city, was predicted to receive up to 4 inches of rainfall during the next 1\u20132 days, more than the average amount that the city receives in the first half of the year.[50] Hundreds of COVID-19 patients were shifted from coastal wards in Mumbai to safer ground. Crews, dressed in hazmat suits, patrolled coastal areas and warned locals to get to higher ground.[14]"

Wind speeds of approximately 150 to 175 kilometres per hour (93 to 109\u00a0mph) were recorded at the district of Diu in the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.[78] A total of 67 people[79] were killed in Gujarat, while 55,384 homes were damaged.[7]  Over 1,000 poles were uprooted while and over 2,400 villages witnessed power supply failures.[80][69][81][74] Only 100 COVID-19 hospitals out of the 400 in the state had power. All hospitals had generators, however, four of them failed. Authorities were sent to repair them. The situation the cyclone brought was labeled as a \"double blow\" by Udaya Regmi, the South Asian head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRCRCS). A COVID-induced curfew that was issued across 36 cities was extended three days due to the cyclone. Originally, it was expected to be cancelled on Tuesday. Several food and water sources that are needed for farmers were interrupted.[50] In the village of Vijapadi, located in Amreli district near the landfall site, most of the houses were damaged by the cyclone due to their weak structures. Many residents were moved to a high school and a madrasa to protect themselves from the storm. The previous afternoon, their power supply had been damaged. Over 30 bullocks, worth \u20b918,000 each, were killed in the area. In neighbouring Hadidad, homes were damaged, along with banana plantations being flattened, with little being left. Houses were said to be totally damaged, being reduced to less than huts. Other livestock, such as goats, were killed in the village.[82] In Saurashtra, storm surge estimated up to 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) was recorded in the coastal districts. Electricity supply was disrupted due to high winds in parts of Amreli, Gir-Somnath, and Diu. Over 100 anchored ships were sent back to the higher grounds due to fears of storm surge. The districts of Junagadh, Gir-Somnath, Bhavnagar, and Amreli were battered by heavy rainfall and winds up to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) by noon of May 17, also being accompanied with dust storms in other regions. Lots of trees including mango farms are uprooted in Rajula . highest number of house damaged are reported in taluka of Rajula .coastal highway near Kodinar was blocked by uprooted coconut trees. A mobile tower and approximately 200 trees fell in Una. Many areas were affected by power outages.[83] Ahmedabad recorded 114\u00a0mm (4.5\u00a0in) of rainfall within 24 hours, nearly breaking a rainfall record of 138.3\u00a0mm (5.44\u00a0in) which was recorded on May 9, 1982. The cyclone caused downpours that began in the afternoon and ended at midnight without stopping. Gusty winds reaching up to 60 to 70\u00a0km/h (35 to 45\u00a0mph) were recorded in the city.[84] By May 19, mobile phone networks were stilled down in several areas after the storm hit the state. Over 600 roads were blocked. A major mango growing belt was damaged.[85] According to initial estimates, the private ports in Gujarat suffered damages worth \u20b97\u00a0billion (US$95.6\u00a0million) while Gujarat Maritime Board-owned ports suffered damages of \u20b950\u00a0million (US$680\u00a0thousand).[86] Total damage statewide stood at \u20b9100\u00a0billion (US$1.37\u00a0billion).[18]"

Three other commercial barges carrying about 700 people are still stranded at sea, one off the coast of Gujarat and the other two near Mumbai.[89] Barge Allianz Commander reported a damage at its cow catcher area and water started filling inside the barge with 300 people on board, the condition was very critical. Search and rescue operations were underway for one of the 270-passenger barges.[14] The search was conducted in winds reaching 90 to 100\u00a0km/h (55 to 60\u00a0mph), with waves reaching as high as 9 to 10\u00a0m (30 to 35\u00a0ft).[90] Meanwhile INS Kochi, the INS Kolkata, and the INS Talwar continued their search operations.[91] A freight ship, oil rig, and four vessels that serviced ONGC's off-shore operations were caught in the cyclone. ONGC held a crew of 261. The men who became stranded on their vessels were maintenance staff. 188 men were rescued from the ships, and 26 bodies were recovered while the search continued for the remaining 47 men.[92] Several other barges were rescued: Gal Constructor with 137 people, Sagar Bhushan (the oil rig) with 101 people, SS03 with 202 men, and M.V. Daniel (the freight ship) with 202 people.[93] Nine crewmembers were tugged ashore when the tug, Coromandal Supporter IX, went aground off of Karnataka. Two other boats lost power and were in need of a tow in rough conditions.[94] The Maharashtra government later criticised the company for ignoring warnings of Cyclone Tauktae.[95]"

However, only vaccinated personnel were sent. Special arrangements for hospitals, COVID-19 support, and other needs were made to ensure electricity would not be interrupted.[13] In Kerala and Karnataka, thousands sought refuge in relief camps due to their homes being damaged by Tauktae, according to the two states' chief ministers.[50] Large amounts of concern lingered for hospitals' abilities to keep enough oxygen for COVID-19 patients, as well as plants generating enough of it.[14] After taking an aerial trip of the areas hit by Tauktae, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that he would give \u20b91,000 crore (US$120\u00a0million) for immediate relief in Gujarat. He also stated he would give \u20b92 lakh (US$2,400) each to families who had their members die in the cyclone. A sum of \u20b950,000 (US$600) would be paid to those injured. He assured that the central government was working closely with the affected states. An inter-ministerial team was also planned to be sent to Gujarat to assess the damage. After, aid would be extended.[99] Due to the unexpected intensity of the cyclone, rescue operations were slower than previously thought.[93] As of May 19, the true number of missing people is still being determined. Despite the power interruptions, all COVID-19 hospitals remained at least somewhat functional.[100] Over 36,000 people were in mass shelters at one time. Evacuated people have been given necessary items in camps; however, they were feared to run out of food rations, hygiene items, and experience loss of lives.[101] The cleaning and repair of huge amounts of houses was thought to be a main concern. Humanitarian assistance was desperately needed for six districts in Gujarat. 230 COVID-ICU patients in Mumbai were shifted from a jumbo COVID-19 center to other, more resilient centers.[68] During a press briefing, the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Vijay Rupani stated that advance preparations and planning led to well-timed evacuations. He also extended the suspension of the COVID-19 vaccination drive by one day, and it was expected to resume on the May 20. UNICEF supported those affected by Tauktae and worked with the interagency group of Gujarat.[54] The Government of Gujarat asked for additional \u20b99,836 crore (US$1.2\u00a0billion) from National Disaster Response Fund and \u20b9500 crore (US$60\u00a0million) from State Disaster Response Fund from the Government of India for relief works.[102] Cyclone Tauktae also caused increased chlorophyll concentration on the coasts of Maharashtra and Gujarat.[103]"

        "content": " Typhoon Rai, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Odette,[1] was a deadly and extremely destructive super typhoon, which was the second costliest typhoon in Philippine history behind Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Rai was a powerful rare tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines in December 2021. Rai became the first Category 5-equivalent super typhoon to develop in the month of December since Nock-ten in 2016, and the third of four Category 5 super typhoons recorded in the South China Sea, along with Pamela in 1954, Rammasun in 2014 and Yagi in 2024. Rai, which named after an artifact called Rai stones, the 22nd and final named tropical storm, the ninth typhoon, and the fifth super typhoon of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season, the system originated from a tropical disturbance near the equator on December 10, forming near the site of another low-pressure area that had dissipated on the previous day. Conditions around the system were favorable for further development, and it slowly developed into a tropical depression on December 12. On the same day, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the consolidating depression. Further intensification ensued, and Rai was upgraded to a tropical storm the next day, before passing south of Ngulu Atoll. After passing near Palau and impacting the island nation, Rai entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) by the night of December 14, where the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) named it \"Odette\". On the next day, both the JMA and JTWC raised the system's intensity to a low-end Category 1-equivalent typhoon, as an eye continued to appear. While approaching the Philippines, Rai rapidly intensified into a Category 5 super typhoon[nb 2] just before its first landfall across Siargao. It then slowly but steadily weakened as it traversed the Visayas, exiting into the Sulu Sea. After making its last landfall over Palawan, Rai continued to weaken before unexpectedly re-intensifying into a Category 5-equivalent typhoon by December 18, while nearing Vietnam. On the next day, Rai entered yet another weakening phase, dissipating on December 21, southeast of Hong Kong. As Rai pounded the Philippines, heavy rainfall and strong and gusty winds impacted several areas around the storm's path. Many areas across the Visayas and Mindanao lost electricity with several provinces and areas being deprived further of communication services. Downed trees obstructed many roadways, and flooding was a major problem across the affected regions, particularly Bohol, where the storm was described as \"one of the worst for the province\". Rivers also overflowed across Cagayan de Oro, while numerous buildings sustained damage. Surigao City was reported to be completely damaged, and appealed for aid. Bohol also pleaded for help from the government due to the damages Rai brought to the area. A state of calamity has been placed in the province and Cebu. So far, 410 people have died, a large portion of which were from the severely affected island of Bohol. Damages at the aforementioned location were projected to be worth \u20b15 billion ($100 million), with those in Siargao being estimated to be worth \u20b120 billion ($401 million) and those in Negros Occidental being estimated to be worth \u20b15.9 billion ($118 million)."

        "content": "At 06:00 UTC on December 9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a low-latitude area of convection in the Pacific Ocean at 4\u00b036\u2032N 142\u00b024\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff4.6\u00b0N 142.4\u00b0E\ufeff / 4.6; 142.4, located about 350 nautical miles (650\u00a0km; 400\u00a0mi) to Palau's east-southeast. A broad circulation was identified by the agency, with flaring convection over it. The circulation had a marginal environment with low to moderate wind shear, fair outflow, and warm sea surface temperatures.[4] Despite its given environment, however, the disturbance failed to intensify and dissipated by 06:00 UTC the next day. Another new area of low pressure formed on December 10, near the location of the previous disturbance. Analysis on the system revealed a degraded and disorganized low-level circulation center.[5][6] Position fixes by 02:30 UTC on December 11 determined that its center had shifted to the north over a developing surface trough, while convective bursts occurred around the system.[7] An advanced scatterometer pass featured below gale-force winds on its northwest quadrant.[8] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) (the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the western Pacific Ocean[9]) first upgraded the system to a tropical depression with winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph),[nb 3] at 00:00 UTC the next day, followed by the JTWC upgrading the storm's chances of developing to \"high\" and subsequently issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[11][12][13] By 03:00 UTC on December 13, the JTWC upgraded the system to a weak tropical depression, highly based on Dvorak ratings of T1.5.[14] Nine hours later, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm based on Dvorak ratings and named the storm Rai.[15] It was not until 15:00 UTC that day when the JTWC upgraded Rai to a tropical storm, as it began tracking northwestward.[16] Three hours later, Rai began to pass south of Ngulu State, while continuing to intensify and organize.[17][18] By December 14 in the early morning, the system was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA.[19] By 09:00 UTC, the JTWC noted that the system's cloud tops became warm; however, it further organized while tracking towards the small island country of Palau.[20] The storm entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility around 11:00 UTC (19:00 PHT), and was named Odette by the PAGASA.[21][22] Four hours later, Rai began to exhibit an eye which was first seen on microwave images.[23] The JMA further upgraded the system to a typhoon by the next day, followed by the JTWC three hours later as Rai began to take a westward motion under the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north.[24][25] Steady intensification occurred on Rai while moving near the country, reaching high-end Category 1-equivalent typhoon intensity by 15:00 UTC. At this time, the JTWC only forecasted a landfall equivalent to a Category 2 storm.[26][27] Rai unexpectedly underwent rapid intensification on December\u00a015, from 120 to 280\u00a0km/h (75 to 175\u00a0mph) by December 16, while nearing landfall. At this time, a small 6 nautical miles (11\u00a0km; 6.9\u00a0mi) eye was seen along with strong convection. The storm began an eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) shortly after reaching peak intensity.[28] On December 16, the typhoon made landfall over Siargao Island in the province of Surigao del Norte around 1:30 PM local time (05:30 UTC)[29] and a second landfall over Dinagat Islands around 3:10 PM local time (07:10 UTC).[30] A third landfall occurred in Liloan, Southern Leyte at 3:40 PM local time (7:40 UTC). A fourth landfall occurred at Panaon Island, also at Liloan, at around 4:50 PM (8:50 UTC).[31] Padre Burgos, Southern Leyte was the fifth at 5:40 PM (09:40 UTC), followed nearly one-hour later at President Carlos P. Garcia, Bohol and approximately another hour at Bien Unido, still at Bohol. The eighth landfall occurred at Carcar, Cebu by 10:00 PM (14:00 UTC) and the ninth over La Libertad, Negros Oriental, two hours later.[32] The JMA estimated a minimum central pressure of 915 millibars (27.0\u00a0inHg) by 03:00 UTC, earlier that day, two hours before its landfall. The same situation slightly weakened the system into a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon by 09:00 UTC, and its intensity continued to degrade, six hours later while crossing Visayas.[33][34][35] As Rai entered Panay Gulf, its eye further weakened and its convective signature becoming disorganized as the JTWC further downgraded it to a Category 3 system six hours later. It continued to weaken while tracking towards the Sulu Sea by the next day at 03:00 UTC.[36][37] A new eye also struggled to form as the system was nearing landfall.[38]\nBy 07:10 UTC (15:10 PHT), the system made another and last landfall over Roxas, Palawan as it continued to lose intensity.[39] It then entered the South China Sea with more organization but its intensity remaining the same.[40] Rai then started to slightly strengthen as it turned northwestward, away from the Philippine archipelago.[41][42] The system then left the PAR by 12:40 PHT (04:40 UTC).[43] For the first time since Typhoon Rammasun in 2014 and the third after Pamela of 1954 and the aforementioned storm, Rai unexpectedly attained Category 5-equivalent super typhoon status in the South China Sea, due to the favorable environment in that region, at 21:00 UTC on December 18, as it underwent a secondary period of rapid intensification, attaining maximum speeds of 270 km/h (165 mph).[44] By 03:00 UTC the next day, Rai again weakened below Category 5-equivalent super typhoon intensity, while turning in a west-northwesterly direction. Its eye was cloud-filled by this time, with the storm rapidly weakening afterward.[45] The storm was still rapidly weakening as of 12:00 UTC on December 20, being forecasted to dissipate off the coast of Guangdong, China.[46] As forecasted, Rai dissipated a day later off the coast of Guangdong Province, China. On March 23, 2022, as PAGASA issued their revised tropical cyclone scale, Rai (Odette) was considered as a super typhoon.[1]"

In its first advisory, PAGASA forecasted the possibility of Signal #4 being raised over the Visayas and Mindanao regions, later lowered to Signal #3.[51][52] The PAGASA also forecasted winds of up to 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) prior to landfall.[53] On December 14, storm signals were raised in Caraga and Eastern Visayas as the storm entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[54] Starting on the night of December 13, land travel on bound to Visayas, Mindanao, the province of Masbate and Catanduanes were canceled according to an approved request of the Office of the Civil Defense in the country. The Land Transportation Office also placed the same travel restrictions in Mindanao and Luzon as a precaution. All types of vessels are also prohibited to leave the country's ports if there are any storm signals raised. Fishermen living near coastal areas were also urged by the country's coast guard to leave their homes \"as soon as possible\". Other Philippine provinces like Bohol and Aklan were also prepared for possible work cancelations and evacuation premises in regards to the storm. Floating cottages in General Santos, as well as fishing boats were brought to shore and safety. The vaccination operations across the possible affected areas were earlier suspended by December 20\u201322.[55][56] Over 23,642 food packs for evacuees were also readied by the country's Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), over 18,665 non-edible items as well as over \u20b1752,250 (US$14,950) worth of standby funds.[57] The airline carrier Cebu Pacific also suspended three flights in the country.[58] Over 12,000 individuals in barangays across Mindanao, Visayas, and further north into Southern Luzon were also urged by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) to immediately leave their homes. The whole of Bicol Region was also under red alert starting on December 14. The higher authorities there also warned its people of possible landslides and lahar flow from the Mayon Volcano. Cebu was also under a \"state of preparedness\" due to the storm. Furthermore, many individuals, of which the majority are going into the Bicol Region in the Para\u00f1aque Integrated Terminal Exchange (PITX) were also stranded due to ferry suspensions. Capiz already started voluntary evacuations at this time, first focused on people living in coastal areas.[59] Liloan, Cebu also initiated forced evacuations by the afternoon of December 15. Several flights into Visayas and Mindanao from Ninoy Aquino International Airport were also delayed, rescheduled, and/or canceled, mainly from the earlier Cebu Pacific, Philippine Airlines and Airasia. Some face-to-face classes in the affected areas were also halted. Many billboards in Bohol were also removed and the annual Binirayan festival in Antique was canceled due to Rai.[60] The city of Surigao was already soaked by the rains of Odette by the afternoon of December 15, including the whole of Eastern Visayas. Thousands of evacuees rushed into safety shelters in the area whereas in one case, they became full. Sandbags were also placed over some houses in Tacloban City in Leyte and many individuals rushed into a grocery store in Alangalang to stock up on essential supplies.[61] Four hours after, Rai entered the PAR, PAGASA started to hoist Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal #1 for southeastern Eastern Samar and over the Surigao provinces, including the Dinagat Islands.[62][63] This was further extended into some provinces in the Central Visayas and further south of Mindanao, until Agusan del Sur.[64] Signal #2 were further placed for the Surigao provinces and further into some parts of Visayas as Odette further intensified into a typhoon, with Signal #1 spreading further into the remaining part of the region and Mimaropa and Southern Tagalog provinces.[65][66] The storm's further intensification led to PAGASA raising the Signal #3 warning in some portions of Caraga and as Rai underwent rapid intensification, into eastern Visayas before Signal #4 was raised in those areas.[67][68] On December 15, militants of the New People's Army attacked troops evacuating residents in Surigao del Sur prior to the storm, killing three civilians.[69] On December 16, the PAGASA raised the signal in western Bohol, Dinagat Islands, and Surigao to Signal #4. 9,720 thousand were evacuated as Typhoon Rai made landfall.[70] Following Rai's impact, around 332,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in total as of December 17.[71]"

A GMA News reporter recalling his experience inside the storm reported that the building where his team was sustained considerable damage, comparing it to Typhoon Haiyan in terms of ferocity. Their vehicles also received damage from the storm. After the storm passed over the area, the whole municipality was reported to be isolated.[105][106] Many provinces in Mindanao also were severely affected by the typhoon. In Cagayan de Oro, despite rushing water, rescue teams continued to save many people in their houses from the floods. A house was heavily destroyed by Odette's strong winds in Agusan del Norte while a barge of unknown origins was left stranded by the storm's waves on a shore, still in the province.[107] Storm surge also impacted the coast boulevards of Surigao del Norte while Iligan's Mandulog River overflowed. The incident was a horror to many residents there, due to the same effect Tropical Storm Washi in 2011 brought. Further south, it also caused rough waves over Cateel.[108] The Cagayan de Oro River also overflowed, causing several homes to be near-completely inundated.[109] The first fatality from the storm was reported at Iloilo, where a woman was crushed to death in her house by a bamboo tree.[110] The first responders themselves are victims. So this is Typhoon Haiyan [Yolanda]   again.[nb 4] Bohol governor Arthur C. Yap, GMA News, December 17, 2021[111] Surigao City was deprived of electricity and communications due to downed power lines while scores of trees left many roads impassable. Many buildings in the area were also devastated and the overall impact of Rai in the area were described as \"widespread\". Clean water supply became a problem in the city while almost all coastal houses were destroyed by the typhoon's storm surge. The main wet market of the area was also closed, still due to the effects of the system.[112][113] Authorities are verifying a possible second death due to Rai in the city and a third elsewhere in southern Mindanao. The mayor of Surigao City, Ernesto Matugas also estimated that 100% of the area was devastated due to Odette, also appealing for aid to the government.[114] Aid was also requested by the province of Bohol, where a chief of the area's Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) described Rai as the \"one of the worst ever for the province\". Many areas in the island were severely inundated, including Loboc, among the worst hit. The whole province also lost power services.[115] The governor of the province, Arthur Yap estimated the damages at \u20b15 billion ($100\u00a0million).[116] A terminal in Siargao Airport was also totally destroyed; the overall island was also wrecked according to the first district representative of Surigao del Norte, Francisco Jose Matugas II.[117] Southern Surigao confirmed a death, while two people died in Bukidnon.[118] Three individuals were killed due to various reasons across Negros Occidental. Numerous houses there were also destroyed by downed trees, with a triage of the Ignacio Locsin Arroyo Memorial District Hospital being wrecked. Some areas in Kabankalan were also inundated due to a river overflowing there.[119] The Philippine National Police (PNP) also listed two people to be unaccounted for from Western Visayas.[120] Further assessments of the NDRRMC reported at least 12 killed due to the typhoon across the affected areas, while seven people were missing. A briefing with the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte occurred on the night of December 17, where the agency noted that many provinces were also pleading for help, especially Cebu.[122] The governor of Surigao also observed that over 99 percent of individuals of Surigao were affected. Aerial operations were also conducted by the Philippine Coast Guard, where they saw the total devastation of the island. The area were also reported to have been isolated from any means of transportations except for air. The government there also estimated damages to be \u20b120\u00a0billion ($401\u00a0million).[123] The Dinagat Islands were also wrecked due to Rai, with their governor Arlene Bag-ao also requesting aid from the government, and saying the islands was \"levelled to the ground\". 95 percent of houses were estimated to have lost their roofs, and emergency shelters were destroyed.[124][125][126] Almost all of Visayas have been left without electricity, according to the Department of Energy (DOE).[127] In Negros Occidental, the agricultural damage is estimated at \u20b14.45\u00a0billion, and damage rose up to \u20b15.41\u00a0billion from the Department of Agriculture and Department of Public Works and Highways.[128][129] At least 332,000 people were evacuated from their homes. The storm affected areas that were still rebuilding from storms late last year.[130] At least 140,000 people were severely affected, with the United Nations estimating 13 million were affected in some way.[131][132] Military-released aerial photos showed General Luna was destroyed by the typhoon.[133] As the ravaged areas were examined, the death toll rose to 75, the majority of which were from Bohol. 12 were further reported by December 19, making the casualty toll at 87 as of that day.[134][135] A landslide also caused the deaths of five people and left six missing, out of 11, further raising the toll to 92.[136] The Associated Press, however indicated that over 112 were killed during the storm.[137] 78 marine vessels in Cebu also experienced sea mishaps, according to the PCG, while over 4,000 houses in Southern Leyte were destroyed due to the storm-induced storm surge.[138][139] In northern Palawan, where Rai made its last landfall before clearing the country, many houses were downed and trees obstructed several roadways. Many locations in the province, including the major city Puerto Princesa were left without electricity, water supply and communication signals.[140] 630,000 people were displaced, 438,000 were in 2,841 evacuation centers.[141] At least 41 areas were flooded, 227 municipalities experienced power outages, and 135 saw telecommunication issues. Three days after the storm, 9% were estimated to have their outages fixed, and 70% communication restored.[142] 139,000 houses were damaged, with 54,000 being totally damaged and 82,000 partially.[143] On Pag-asa Island of the Spratly Islands, some residential houses, schools, and government facilities including the new coast guard station were severely damaged by the typhoon.[144][145]"

Duterte started to tour Surigao City, Siargao, Maasin, and Dinagat Islands on December 18.[166][167] Aid teams were not able to enter into certain affected areas due to waterlogging, debris, and other obstacles.[168] Thousands of emergency personnel were deployed.[169] 2 people died of dehydration after Rai passed.[170] Catholic Bishops in the country declared Christmas Day and December 26 as national days of prayer and mourning for Rai's victims.[171] The government's promise for 35,000 food packs took longer than expected to arrive, and was found to not be enough for people affected. Days later in Bohol, power outages still ranged in the millions.

Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved.[5] The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[6] The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000\u00a0BC,[7] and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC.[7][8] The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue.[7][9] Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[10] Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106\u00a0AD, who annexed and renamed it as Arabia Petraea.[11] Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.[12] UNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\".[13] Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 1.1\u00a0million in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above the 1\u00a0million mark.[14] Tourism in the historical city was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, but soon after started to pick up again, reaching 905,000 visitors in 2022.[15]"

Things that were traded here included wines, olive oil, and wood. Initially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by scholars.[17] The Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than the seventh century BC (Iron II).[18]"

        "content": "The Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water.[19] Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe.[20] Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raq\u0192\u00ecm\u2248\u00e7, variously spelled in inscriptions as rqmw or rqm.[4] The Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37\u201a\u00c4\u00ec100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, \"ranks highest in the land of the Arabs\" and was still called Rekeme by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7).[21] The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified Rekem as Petra.[22] Arabic raqama means \"to mark, to decorate\", so Rekeme could be a Nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock fa\u221a\u00dfades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script. One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu (Jerash).[23][24] An old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called sela in the Hebrew Bible. Encyclop\u221a\u00b6dia Britannica (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that sela simply means \"rock\" in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the book of Obadiah. It is possible that the city was part of the nation of Edom. [25] The passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94\u201a\u00c4\u00ec97) which describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC, was understood by some researchers to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \"petra\" (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.[25][26]"

        "content": "In AD 106, when Cornelius Palma was governor of Syria, the part of Arabia under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital.[27] The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of Alexander Severus, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the neo-Persian power under the Sassanid Empire.[25] Meanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130\u201a\u00c4\u00ec270) grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious center. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315\u201a\u00c4\u00ec403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virgin Khaabou (Chaabou) and her offspring Dushara.[25] Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the main deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.[28] Between 111 and 114 Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the Pax Romana, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian's administrators left marks[dubious \u2013 discuss] in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130 AD, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of Hadri\u0192\u00c5n\u0192\u00b4 Petra Metropolis, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family. The interest that Roman emperors showed in the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the temenos of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor's portrait, as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a Roman colony, when he reorganized the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century.[29] The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. Petra may be seen on the Madaba mosaic map from the reign of Emperor Justinian."

In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system.[30] The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century.[31] The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra. The last reference to Byzantine Petra comes from the Spiritual Meadow of John Moschus, written in the first decades of the 7th century. He gives an anecdote about its bishop, Athenogenes. It ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before 687 when that function had been transferred to Areopolis. Petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.[32]"

As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century.[33][34] Two further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu'ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to Little Petra. It is the castle that was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate a surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis, in the heart of Petra, and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint. The ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the Middle Ages and were visited by Baibars, one of the first Mamluk sultans of Egypt, towards the end of the 13th century.[25]"

        "content": "The first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812.[25][35] At that time, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem operated a diocese in al-Karak named Battra (Arabic: \u00ff\u00ae\u00ff\u00df\u00ff\u2211\u00ff\u00b1\u0178\u00e1, Ancient Greek: \u0152\u2020\u0152\u2260\u0153\u00d1\u0153\u00c5\u0152\u00b1\u0153\u00c7) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.[35] Burckhardt already spoke Arabic fluently, and was on his way to explore the Niger River when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, and became fascinated with finding the city. He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron's Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.[36] L\u221a\u00a9on de Laborde and Louis-Maurice-Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds made the first accurate drawings of Petra in 1828.[37] The Scottish painter David Roberts visited Petra in 1839 and returned to Britain with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes, published in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia. Frederic Edwin Church, the leading American landscape painter of the 19th century, visited Petra in 1868, and the resulting painting El Khasn\u221a\u00a9, Petra is among his most important and well-documented.[37] Missionary Archibald Forder published photographs of Petra in the December 1909 issue of National Geographic. Because the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.[38] The archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.[39] In the 1980s, the Bedul Bedouin, once inhabitants of Petra, were relocated by the Jordanian government to the nearby settlement of Umm Sayhoun, a process spanning two decades. This move was part of broader initiatives aimed at settling Bedouin communities and promoting tourism in Petra.[40][41] With a name meaning \"the changing ones\" and oral traditions recounting a conversion narrative, the Bedul Bedouins are believed to have adopted Islam later in their history, possibly with Jewish or Nabatean origins.[42][43][44] Today, alongside their traditional activities, they engage in local tourism, alongside the more prominent Liyathnah tribe.[40] Numerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.[45]"

        "content": "Petra is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[25] Excavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.[47][48] In ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (\"Aaron's Mountain\"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3\u201a\u00c4\u00ec4\u00a0m (10\u201a\u00c4\u00ec13\u00a0ft) wide, called the Siq (\"shaft\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.[49]"

        "header": "Hellenistic architecture",
        "content": "Petra is known primarily for its Hellenistic architecture. The facades of the tombs in Petra are commonly rendered in Hellenistic style, reflecting the number of diverse cultures which the Nabataens traded, all of which were in turn influenced by Greek culture. Most of these tombs contain small burials niches carved into the stone.[50] Perhaps the best example of the Hellenistic style is seen in the Treasury, which is 24 meters (79\u00a0ft) wide and 37 meters (121\u00a0ft) tall and references the architecture of Alexandria.[51] The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury are the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, who protect travellers on their journeys. Near the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis and Tyche being the Egyptian and Greek goddesses, respectively, of good fortune.[50] Another prime example of Hellenistic architecture featured in Petra is its Monastery, which stands at 45 meters (148\u00a0ft) tall and 50 meters (160\u00a0ft) wide; this is Petra's largest monument and is similarly carved into the rock face. The facade of this again features a broken pediment, similar to the Treasury, as well as another central tholos. The Monastery displays more of a Nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from Greek architecture.[50] Its only source of light is its entrance standing at 8 meters (26\u00a0ft) high. There is a large space outside of the Monastery, which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes. Formerly, in the Byzantine period, this was a place for Christian worship, but is now a holy site for pilgrims to visit."

        "content": "At the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh (\"the Treasury\"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.[49] A little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.[25] The theatre  was said to hold around 8,500 people.[52] The performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas. Gladiator fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience, although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it. The theatre was one of many structures in Petra that took significant damage due to the 363 Galilee earthquake.[52] The Petra Pool and Garden Complex is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area,[53] excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.[54][55][56] Ahead of the Petra Pool and Garden Complex lies Colonnaded street, which is among few artifacts of Petra that was constructed rather than natural. This street used to hold a semi-circle nymphaeum, which is now in ruins due to flash flooding, and used to hold Petra's only tree. This was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the Nabataens were able to construct in Petra. Once the Romans took control of the city, Colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk, and 72 columns were added to each side.[57]"

From there, the site of The High Place of Sacrifice is around an 800-step hike. One commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was libation. Another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice; this is due to the belief that the tomb of the Prophet Aaron is located in Petra, which is a sacred site for Muslims. In honor of this, a goat was sacrificed annually. Other rituals also took place there, including the burning of frankincense.[59]"

The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb.

It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about 0.5\u00a0mi (0.8\u00a0km) south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161\u00a0ft (56 by 49\u00a0m) platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, 28 by 28\u00a0ft (8.5 by 8.5\u00a0m), which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.[61][62][63]"

        "header": "Religious importance",
        "content": "Pliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.[25] The Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-\u201a\u00c4\u00f2Uzz\u0192\u00c5, Allat and Man\u0192\u00c5t. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.[64] A stele dedicated to Qos-Allah 'Qos is Allah' or 'Qos the god', by Qosmilk (melech: king) is found at Petra (Glueck 516). Qos is identifiable with Kaush (Qaush) the God of the older Edomites. The stele is horned and the seal from the Edomite Tawilan near Petra identified with Kaush displays a star and crescent (Browning 28), both consistent with a moon deity. It is conceivable that the latter could have resulted from trade with Harran (Bartlett 194). There is continuing debate about the nature of Qos (qaus: bow) who has been identified both with a hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god) although the crescent above the stele is also a bow.[citation needed] Nabataean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names including Allah, El and Allat (god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza, Baal and Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in Sinai in South Arabian language. Allah occurs particularly as Garm-'allahi: \"god decided\" (Greek Garamelos) and Aush-allahi: \"gods covenant\" (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi \"Allah is peace\" and Shalm-allat, \"the peace of the goddess\". We also find Amat-allahi \"she-servant of god\" and Halaf-llahi \"the successor of Allah\".[65] Recently, Petra has been put forward as the original direction of Muslim prayer, the Qibla, by some that the earliest mosques faced Petra, not Jerusalem or Mecca.[66] This view is also shared by Abdullah Hashem, the self-proclaimed Qa'im of the Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light.[67] However, others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of Qiblah directions to early mosques\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Qiblahs as they claim early Muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the Qiblah to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental.[68] The Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic Ad Deir).[citation needed] The Temple of the Winged Lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of King Aretas IV (9 BC\u201a\u00c4\u00ec40 AD). The temple is located in Petra's so-called Sacred Quarter, an area situated at the end of Petra's main Colonnaded Street consisting of two majestic temples, the Qasr al-Bint and, opposite, the Temple of the Winged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa. Christianity found its way to Petra in the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre. The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian Emperor of Rome took over, Constantine I, otherwise known as Constantine The Great. He began the initial spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Anhioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (the \"tomb with the urn\"?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \"in the time of the most holy bishop Jason\" (447). After the Islamic conquest of 629\u201a\u00c4\u00ec632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam. During the First Crusade Petra was occupied by Baldwin I of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Al Karak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title Ch\u221a\u00a2teau de la Val\u221a\u00a9e de Moyse or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189.[25] It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church.[69] According to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot where Musa (Moses) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Harun (Aaron), is buried, at Mount Hor, known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The Wadi Musa or \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.[70]"

Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the 'back route' into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.[71] On December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.[72] The Bedoul belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed[73] in 2008. In 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.[74] The process of developing the Strategic Plan considered the area's needs from five points of view: The site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion due to flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling,[75] improper restoration of ancient structures, and unsustainable tourism.[76] The last has increased substantially, especially since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007 during the New7Wonders of the World Internet and cellphone campaign.[77]Tourism has steadily grown, with Petra receiving 1.2 million total visitors in 2019.[78] In an attempt to reduce the problems, the Petra National Trust (PNT) was established in 1989. It has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site.[79] Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. The presentation Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction? (2012) was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.[80] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting the abuse of working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered. PETA also showed some wounded animals, including camels with fly-infested, open wounds.[81] The Jordanian authority running the site responded by proposing a veterinary clinic, and by undertaking to spread awareness among animal handlers.[82] In 2020, more video released by PETA indicated that conditions for the animals had not improved and, in 2021, the organization was running what appeared to be the only veterinary clinic in the area.[83][84] Petra is a site at the intersection of natural and cultural heritage forming a unique cultural landscape. Ever since Johann Ludwig Burckhardt[85] aka Sheikh Ibrahim had re-discovered the ruin city in Petra, Jordan, in 1812, the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the Nabataeans such as travellers, pilgrims, painters and savants.[86] However, it was not until the late 19th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers.[87] Since then regular archaeological excavations[88] and ongoing research on the Nabataean culture have been part of today's UNESCO world cultural heritage site Petra.[89] Through the excavations in the Petra Archaeological Park an increasing number of Nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact. A central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades.[90] The large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage, as especially this connection is a central challenge at the UNECSO World Heritage Site.[91] In recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of Petra.[92] The main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the Siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access. Also, different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted. Following is a list of projects, to be continued."

        "content": " Virginia Beach, officially the City of Virginia Beach, is the most populous city in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States. The population was 459,470 at the 2020 census.[2] Located on the southeastern coast of Virginia, it is the sixth-most populous city in the Mid-Atlantic and the 43rd-most populous city in the U.S. Located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia Beach is a principal city in the Hampton Roads metropolitan area which has more than 1.8 million inhabitants and is the 37th-largest metropolitan area in the U.S.[6] Virginia Beach is a resort city with miles of beaches and hundreds of hotels, motels, and restaurants along its oceanfront. Near the point where the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean meet, Cape Henry was the site of the first landing of the English colonists who eventually settled in Jamestown; modern Virginia Beach was established in 1906. It is home to several state parks, protected beaches, and military bases. Virginia Wesleyan University, Regent University, Christian Broadcasting Network, the U.S. headquarters of Stihl, and the Association for Research and Enlightenment are based in Virginia Beach. It also hosts the annual East Coast Surfing Championships and Neptune Festival. The city is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as having the longest pleasure beach in the world.[7] It is located at the southern end of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, which was the world's longest bridge-tunnel complex[8] until the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge opened in 2018.[9]"

        "content": "The Chesepian were the historic indigenous people of the area now known as Tidewater in Virginia at the time of European encounter. Little is known about them[10] but archeological evidence suggests they may have been related to the Carolina Algonquian, or Pamlico people. They would have spoken one of the Algonquian languages. These were common among the numerous tribes of the coastal area, who made up the loose Powhatan Confederacy, numbering in the tens of thousands in population. The Chesepian occupied an area which is now defined as the independent cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.[11] In 1607, after a voyage of 144 days, three ships headed by Captain Christopher Newport, and carrying 105 men and boys, made their first landfall in the New World on the mainland, where the southern mouth of the Chesapeake Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean. They named it Cape Henry, after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King James I of England. These English colonists of the Virginia Company of London moved on from this area, as they were under orders to seek a site further inland, which would be more sheltered from ships of competing European countries. They created their first permanent settlement on the north side of the James River at Jamestown.[12] Adam Thoroughgood (1604\u20131640) of King's Lynn, Norfolk, England is one of the earliest Englishmen to settle in this area, which was developed as Virginia Beach. At the age of 18, he had contracted as an indentured servant to pay for passage to the Virginia Colony in the hopes of bettering his life. He earned his freedom after several years and became a leading citizen of the area. In 1629, he was elected to the House of Burgesses for Elizabeth Cittie  [sic], one of four \"cities\" (or incorporations) which were subdivided areas established in 1619.[13] In 1634, the Colony was divided into the original eight shires of Virginia, soon renamed as counties. Thoroughgood is credited with using the name of his home in England when helping name \"New Norfolk County\" in 1637. The following year, New Norfolk County was split into Upper Norfolk County (soon renamed Nansemond County) and Lower Norfolk County. Thoroughgood resided after 1634 was along the Lynnhaven River, named for his home in England.[14] Lower Norfolk County was large when first organized, defined as from the Atlantic Ocean west past the Elizabeth River, encompassing the entire area now within the modern cities of Portsmouth, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.[13] It attracted many entrepreneurs, including William Moseley with his family in 1648. Belonging to the Merchant Adventurers Guild of London, he immigrated from Rotterdam of the Netherlands, where he had been in international trade. He settled on land on the north side of the Elizabeth River, east of what developed as Norfolk. Following the increased settlement, in 1691 Lower Norfolk County was divided to form Norfolk and Princess Anne counties. Princess Anne, the easternmost county in South Hampton Roads, extended from Cape Henry at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, south to what became the border of the North Carolina colony. It included all of the area fronting the Atlantic Ocean. Princess Anne County was known as a jurisdiction from 1691 to 1963, over 250 years.[15] In the early centuries, this area was rural and developed for plantation agriculture. In the late 19th century, the small resort area of Virginia Beach developed in Princess Anne County after the 1883 arrival of rail service to the coast. The Virginia Beach Hotel was opened and operated by the Norfolk and Virginia Beach Railroad and Improvement Company at the oceanfront, near the tiny community of Seatack. The hotel was foreclosed and the railroad was reorganized in 1887. The hotel was upgraded and reopened in 1888 as the Princess Anne Hotel.[16] In 1891, guests at the new hotel watched the wreck and rescue efforts of the United States Life-Saving Service for the Norwegian barque Dictator. The ship's figurehead, which washed up on the beach several days later, was erected as a monument to the victims and rescuers. It stood along the oceanfront for more than 50 years. In the 21st century, it inspired the pair of matching Norwegian Lady Monuments, sculpted by \u00d8rnulf Bast and installed in Virginia Beach and Moss, Norway.[17] The resort initially depended on railroad and electric trolley service. The completion of Virginia Beach Boulevard in 1922, which extended from Norfolk to the oceanfront, opened the route for automobiles, buses, and trucks. The passenger rail service to the oceanfront was eventually discontinued as traffic increased by vehicles. The growing resort of Virginia Beach became an incorporated town in 1906. Over the next 45 years, Virginia Beach continued to grow in popularity as a seasonal vacation spot. The casinos were replaced by amusement parks and family-oriented attractions. In 1927 The Cavalier Hotel opened and became a popular vacation spot.[18][19] Virginia Beach gained status as an independent city in 1952, although ties remained between it and Princess Anne County. In 1963, after voters in the two jurisdictions passed a supporting referendum, and with the approval of the Virginia General Assembly, the two political subdivisions were consolidated as a new, much larger independent city, retaining the better-known name of the Virginia Beach resort.[20] The Alan B. Shepard Civic Center (\"The Dome\"), a significant building in the city's history because of the many famous musical acts played there,[21] was constructed in 1958,[22] and was dedicated to the career of former Virginia Beach resident and astronaut Alan Shepard.[23] As the area changed, the Dome was frequently used as a bingo hall. The building was razed in 1994[22] to make room for a municipal parking lot and potential future development."

        "content": "Real estate, defense, and tourism are major sectors of the Virginia Beach economy. Many local public and private groups have maintained a vested interest in real-estate redevelopment, resulting in a number of joint public-private projects, such as commercial parks. Examples of the public-private development include the Virginia Beach Convention Center, the Oceanfront Hilton Hotel, and the Virginia Beach Town Center. The city assisted in financing the project through the use of tax increment financing: creating special tax districts and constructing associated street and infrastructure to support the developments. The Town Center opened in 2003, with related construction continuing.[24][25][26] The Convention Center opened in 2005.[27][28] The city has begun to run out of clear land available for new construction north of the Green Line, an urban growth boundary dividing the urban northern and rural southern sections of the city.[29] Infill and development of residential neighborhoods has placed a number of operating constraints on Naval Air Station Oceana, a major fighter jet base for the U.S. Navy. While the airbase enjoys wide support from Virginia Beach at large, the Pentagon Base Realignment and Closure commission has proposed closure of Oceana within the next decade.[30]  In 2012 a Navy jet that took off from Oceana experienced engine failure and crashed into an apartment complex.[31] This land crunch led to floodplain development. During Hurricane Matthew, the heavy rainfall flooded over 2000 homes and left some neighborhoods with standing water for days.[32] Given the rising risks of flooding due to climate change and the impetus of the hurricane damage, the city rejected several further development proposals. This rejection was significant from two perspectives. First, cities reject building very rarely, demonstrating the shift in public perception. Second, these rejections led to lawsuits by the developers. The rejection of these lawsuits in the courts provides precedent for other sorts of local climate change adaptation efforts in the future. Discussing the matter, Mayor Dyer noted, \"It's a confrontation with reality. Not everybody's going to be happy.\"[33] On May 31, 2019, a shooting occurred at a municipal government building in Virginia Beach. A former employee entered the building and shot indiscriminately, killing 12 people and injuring four others before dying from a gunshot wound fired by responding officers.[34][35][36]"

The average elevation is 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) above sea level. A major portion of the city drains to the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Lynnhaven River and its tributaries. The city is located at the southeastern corner of Virginia in the Hampton Roads area bordering the Atlantic Ocean.[38] The Hampton Roads Metropolitan Statistical Area (officially known as the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA) is the 37th largest in the United States, with a total population of 1,707,639. The area includes the Virginia cities of Norfolk,[39] Virginia Beach, Chesapeake,[40] Hampton,[41] Newport News,[42] Poquoson,[43] Portsmouth,[44] Suffolk,[45] Williamsburg,[46] and the counties of Gloucester, Isle of Wight, James City, Mathews, Surry, and York, as well as the North Carolina county of Currituck. While Virginia Beach is the most populated city within the MSA, it actually currently functions more as a suburb. The city of Norfolk is recognized as the central business district, while the Virginia Beach oceanside resort district and Williamsburg are primarily centers of tourism. Additionally, Virginia Beach is 19 miles (31\u00a0km) east of Norfolk,[47] 24 miles (39\u00a0km) northeast of Chesapeake,[48] 208 miles (335\u00a0km) southeast of Washington DC, 107 miles (172\u00a0km) southeast of Richmond, the state capitol,[49] and 200 miles (320\u00a0km) northeast of Raleigh, North Carolina[50]"

        "content": "The climate of Virginia Beach is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa). For the Trewartha climate classification the climate is the northern limit of Cf (subtropical).[60][61] Much of the year in Virginia Beach is mild to warm. The long summer season from late May through late September is often hot and humid, with frequent (but brief) late day thundershowers. Winters are cool with little frozen precipitation, and snowfall is light.  The official weather statistics are recorded at Norfolk International Airport on the extreme northwestern border of Virginia Beach. The mean annual temperature is 59.6\u00a0\u00b0F (15.3\u00a0\u00b0C), with an average annual snowfall of 5.8 inches (150\u00a0mm) at the airport to around 3.0 inches (76\u00a0mm) in the southeastern corner around Back Bay.[62] Average annual precipitation (the large majority rainfall) is high, ranging between 47 inches (1,200\u00a0mm) at the airport to over 50 inches (1,300\u00a0mm) per year at Back Bay. The wettest season is summer, specifically July to early September, with August the single wettest month, averaging over 5.5 inches of rain. From October to June, average monthly precipitation is remarkably consistent, ranging between 3.1 and 3.7 inches. Virginia Beach averages 2200 hours of sunshine annually, higher than the USA average. The highest recorded temperature to date was 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) in July 2010, and the lowest recorded temperature was \u22123\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221219\u00a0\u00b0C) in January 1985, both being recorded at Norfolk International Airport.[63] The coldest daily maximum on record was 12\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221211\u00a0\u00b0C) in December 1917, whereas the 1991\u20132020 normals had a coldest maximum average of 29\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22122\u00a0\u00b0C).[63] This means that in spite of the mild normals, most years record at least one ice day, with rare exceptions. Summer nights are sometimes really hot. The all-time record warmest low temperature is 84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C) from July 1942, while a normal year's warmest night averages 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C).[63] Additionally, the geographic location of the city, with respect to the principal storm tracks, is especially favorable which is why it has earned the reputation as a vacation destination. It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003.[64] Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. Spanish moss, for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like the Windmill Palm, Sabal palmetto, Butia odorata (in protected locations), and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west. The hardiness zone is 8b along the coast and in Urban areas, and 8a inland and to the northwest. On April 30, 2023, an EF-3 tornado struck the Great Neck neighborhood in the northeastern section of the city. It was on the ground from 5:48 to 5:53 PM EST. Miraculously, no one was killed nor injured. It is the strongest tornado on record to hit the city.[65][66][67]"

Restaurants and entertainment industries also directly benefit from Virginia Beach's tourism.[99][106][107] Virginia Beach has a large agribusiness sector which produces $80\u00a0million for the city economy. One hundred-seventy-two farms exist in Virginia Beach, mostly below the greenline in the southern portion of the city. Farmers are able to sell their goods and products at the city's Farmer's Market.[108][109] Virginia Beach is home to several United States Military bases.[110][111] These include the United States Navy's NAS Oceana and Training Support Center Hampton Roads, and the Joint Expeditionary Base East located at Cape Henry.[112][113]\nAdditionally, NAB Little Creek is located mostly within the city of Virginia Beach but carries a Norfolk address.[114] NAS Oceana is the largest employer in Virginia Beach; it was decreed by the 2005 BRAC Commission that NAS Oceana must close unless the city of Virginia Beach condemns houses in areas designated as \"Accident Potential Zones.\" This action has never been the position of the United States Navy; indeed, the Navy had not recommended NAS Oceana to the BRAC Commission for potential closure.[30] Both NAS Oceana and Training Support Center Hampton Roads are considered to be the largest of their respective kind in the world. Furthermore, located in nearby Norfolk is the central hub of the United States Navy's Atlantic Fleet, Naval Station Norfolk.[115][116] 54% of the 171,000 people working in Virginia Beach live in the city, 12% live in Chesapeake, and 10% live in Norfolk. An additional 99,600 people commute from Virginia Beach, with 35% going to Norfolk and 23% going to Chesapeake. Unemployment has been cut almost in half over the past two years going from a high of 4.2% in January 2017 to 2.8% in June 2019.[117][verification needed]"

The Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art features regularly changing exhibitions in a variety of media. Exhibitions feature painting, sculpture, photography, glass, video and other visual media from internationally acclaimed artists as well as artists of national and regional renown. MOCA was born from the annual Boardwalk Art Show, which began in 1952 and is now the museum's largest fundraiser.[118] The Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center (formerly the Virginia Marine Science Museum) is a popular aquarium near the oceanfront that features various sharks, sting rays, sea turtles, jellyfish, and octopuses.[119][120] One of the world's largest collections of World War I and World War II aircraft is located at the Military Aviation Museum in the Pungo area of Virginia Beach.[121] The Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater at Virginia Beach, built in 1996, features a wide variety of popular shows and concerts. The Sandler Center, a 1200-seat performing arts theatre, opened in the Virginia Beach Town Center in November 2007.[122] Virginia Beach is home to many sites of historical importance and has 18 sites on the National Register of Historic Places. Such sites include the Adam Thoroughgood House (one of the oldest surviving colonial homes in Virginia), the Francis Land House (a 200-year-old plantation), the Cape Henry Lights and nearby Cape Henry Light Station (a second tower), De Witt Cottage, Adam Keeling House, and others.[123][124][125][126][127] The Edgar Cayce Hospital for Research and Enlightenment was established in Virginia Beach in 1928 with 60 beds. The 67th street facility features a large private library of books on psychic matters and is open to the public. The traditional beach-architecture headquarters building features massage therapy by appointment. Cayce opened Atlantic University in 1930; it closed two years later but was re-opened in 1985. Atlantic University was originally intended for study of Cayce's readings and research on spiritual subjects.[128] The city's largest festival, the Neptune Festival, attracts 500,000 visitors to the oceanfront and 350,000 visitors to the air show at NAS Oceana.[129][130] Celebrating the city's heritage link with Norway, events are held in September in the oceanfront and Town Center areas.[131][132] Every Labor Day Weekend, the American Music Festival provides festival attendees with live music performed on stages all over the oceanfront, including the beach on Fifth Street. The festival formerly ended with the Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon, but no longer since the cancelation of the event in the city.[133] Last Night On The Town is an annual New Year's Eve celebration that takes place every December 31.[134][135]"

While the Hampton Roads area has been recently considered as a viable prospect for major-league professional sports, and regional leaders have attempted to obtain Major League Baseball, NBA and NHL franchises in the recent past, no team has yet relocated to the area.[137][138] Hampton Roads is the largest metropolitan area in the United States without a club in a major professional sports league. The Norfolk Admirals won the AHL Calder Cup in 2012.[139] The Virginia Destroyers, a UFL franchise, played at the Virginia Beach Sportsplex until the league's collapse in 2012.[140] Virginia Beach Professional Baseball, LLC, was awarded an Atlantic League franchise in April 2013. Known as the Virginia Beach Neptunes, they have yet to play a game due to delays in building Wheeler Field.[141] Two soccer teams, the Virginia Beach Piranhas, a men's team in the USL Premier Development League, and the Hampton Roads Piranhas, a women's team in the W-League play at the Virginia Beach Sportsplex. The Virginia Beach Sportsplex contains the central training site for the U.S. women's national field hockey team.[142] The city is also home to the East Coast Surfing Championships, an annual contest of more than 100 of the world's top professional surfers and an estimated 400 amateur surfers. This is North America's oldest surfing contest.[143] There are eleven golf courses open to the public in the city, as well as four country club layouts and 36 military holes at NAS Oceana's Aeropines course. Among the best-known public courses are Hell's Point Golf Club and Virginia Beach National, the latter of which hosted the Virginia Beach Open, a Nationwide Tour event from 2000 to 2006.[144] Also, the Kingsmill Resort in nearby Williamsburg hosts the Kingsmill Championship, an annual LPGA Tour tournament. Virginia Beach is host to a Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon each year on Labor Day weekend in conjunction with the American Music Festival. It is one of the largest Half Marathons in the world. The final 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) are on the boardwalk.[145] Virginia Beach also hosts the Yuengling Shamrock Marathon, founded in 1973 with over 24,000 participants. It is an annual race over St. Patrick's Day weekend and was recognized by Runner's World as one of the Top 20 marathons in the country in 1992.[146]"

The hill measures 60\u00a0ft (18\u00a0m) high and is the highest point in Virginia Beach.[148][149][150] One of the major parks is Red Wing Park, a 97 acres (39\u00a0ha) park in east-central part of the city, very close to Oceana Naval Air Station. This land became a park in 1966. A unique feature of this park is the Miyazaki Japanese Garden, which is a result of its interactions with its sister city Miyazaki, Japan.[151] The Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1938, is an 8,000-acre (32\u00a0km2) freshwater refuge that borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east and Back Bay on the west. It is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.[152] First Landing State Park and False Cape State Park are both located in coastal areas within the city's corporate limits as well.[153][154] Munden Point Park is a rural park located in the deep southern end of the city,[155] right on The North Landing River.[156] Pleasure House Point is a 118 acres (48 hectares) park of undeveloped land on the shore of the Lynnhaven River. It is also the location of the Brock Environmental Center.[158] Virginia Beach's extensive park system is recognized as one of the best in the United States. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported that Virginia Beach had the 8th best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities.[159]"

However, the Republican edge in the city has diminished in recent years. John McCain and Donald Trump only managed to win a plurality of the city's votes in 2008 and 2016, winning the city despite losing statewide. In 2020,[162] Joe Biden became the first Democrat to carry Virginia Beach since 1964, and only the third to do so since Virginia Beach became an independent city. Biden became the first presidential candidate to win at least 51% of the vote in Virginia Beach since President George W. Bush in 2004.[163][164] Virginia Beach was chartered as a municipal corporation by the General Assembly of Virginia on January 1, 1963. The city currently operates under the council\u2013manager form of government.[166] The city does not fall under the jurisdiction of a county government, due to state law. Rather, it functions as an independent city and operates as a political subdivision of the state. The city's legislative body consists of an eleven-member city council. The city manager is appointed by the council and acts as the chief executive officer. Through his staff, he implements policies established by the council.[167] Members of the city council normally serve four-year terms and are elected on a staggered basis in non-partisan elections. Beginning in 2008, general elections are held the first Tuesday in November in even-numbered years. In previous years, elections were held the first Tuesday in May in even-numbered years. All registered voters are eligible to vote for all council members. Three council members and the mayor serve on an at-large basis. All others are elected by district (and must live in the district they represent): Bayside, Beach, Centerville, Kempsville, Lynnhaven, Princess Anne, and Rose Hall.[166] The mayor is elected to a four-year term through direct election. The mayor presides over city council meetings and serves as the ceremonial head and spokesperson of the city. A vice mayor is also elected by the city council at the first meeting following a council election.[167] Citizens of Virginia Beach also elect five constitutional officers, and candidates for these offices are permitted to run with an affiliated political party. Three of these offices deal substantially with public safety and justice: the sheriff, commonwealth's attorney, and the clerk of the circuit court. The two other offices are concerned with fiscal policy: the city treasurer and the commissioner of the revenue.[168][169] The city provides law enforcement through the Virginia Beach Police Department and emergency services through the Virginia Beach Fire Department.[170][171] Virginia Beach is located entirely in Virginia's 2nd congressional district, served by Republican Jen Kiggans.[172] Virginia Beach is one of the few cities in the state with laws that prohibit profanity in public spaces. The law was repealed by the State Legislature in early 2020. It is considered a Class 3 misdemeanor.[173][174]"

Prior to 1969, separate schools were maintained for black and white students. Before 1938, black students who wished to attend school past seventh grade had to travel to Norfolk and pay tuition to attend Booker T. Washington High School. In 1938, the first high school for blacks, the Princess Anne County Training School was built. In 1961, in order to avoid the stigma of the term \"training school\", the school was renamed Union Kempsville High School at the request of the black community. When the public schools integrated in 1969, Union Kempsville was closed.[175][176][177] The city of Virginia Beach is home to Virginia Beach City Public Schools, one of the largest school systems in the state (based on student enrollment).

Both the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech operate satellite campuses in Virginia Beach.[198][199][200] Tidewater Community College, a major junior college, also has its largest campus located in the city.[201] ECPI University, a for-profit career college, has its headquarters in Virginia Beach. Additional institutions of higher education are located in other communities of greater Hampton Roads.[202] The Virginia Beach Public Library System provides free access to accurate and current information and materials to all individuals and promotes reading as a critical life skill.

The heavy rainfall ended on September\u00a029.[2] Over three days, Mtunzini recorded 801\u00a0mm (31.5\u00a0in) of precipitation.[1] The heaviest rainfall occurred in mountainous areas, causing landslides and flash floods, particularly in rivers.[3] Water levels along the Umgeni River were so high that it washed away an entire island. The Mvoti River swelled to a width of 900\u00a0m (3,000\u00a0ft), from its normal width of 35\u00a0m (115\u00a0ft).[4] There were a total of 506\u00a0fatalities related to the event.[5] The floods damaged more than 30,000\u00a0houses, leaving more than 50,000\u00a0people homeless.

Idai is the deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean basin. In the Southern Hemisphere, which includes the Australian, South Pacific, and South Atlantic basins, Idai ranks as the second-deadliest tropical cyclone on record. The only system with a higher death toll is the 1973 Flores cyclone that killed 1,650 off the coast of Indonesia.[5][6] The tenth named storm, seventh tropical cyclone, and seventh intense tropical cyclone of the 2018\u201319 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Idai originated from a tropical depression that formed off the east coast of Mozambique on 4 March 2019. The storm, Tropical Depression 11, made landfall in Mozambique later in the day and remained a tropical depression through its five-day trek over land. On 9 March, the depression re-emerged into the Mozambique Channel and strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Idai on the next day. Idai then began a stint of rapid intensification, reaching an initial peak intensity as an intense tropical cyclone, with sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on 11 March. Idai then began to weaken, due to ongoing structural changes within its inner core, falling to tropical cyclone intensity. Idai's intensity remained stagnant for about a day or so before it began to re-intensify. On 14 March, Idai reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg). Idai then began to weaken as it approached the coast of Mozambique, due to less favourable conditions, weakening below intense tropical cyclone status later that day. On 15 March, Idai made landfall near Beira, Mozambique, subsequently weakening into a remnant low on 16 March. Idai's remnants slowly continued inland for another day, before reversing course and turning eastward on 17 March. On 19 March, Idai's remnants re-emerged into the Mozambique Channel and eventually dissipated on 21 March.[7][8] Idai brought strong winds and caused severe flooding in Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe, which killed at least 1,593\u00a0people[9] \u2013 and affected more than 3\u00a0million others.[10] Catastrophic damage occurred in and around Beira in central Mozambique. The President of Mozambique stated that more than 1,000\u00a0people may have died in the storm.[11] A major humanitarian crisis unfolded in the wake of the cyclone, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe. In the former nation, rescuers were forced to let some people die in order to save others.[12] A cholera outbreak ensued in the storm's wake, with more than 4,000\u00a0confirmed cases and seven fatalities by 10\u00a0April. Total damages from Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, and Malawi were estimated to be around $3.3\u00a0billion (2019 USD),[13][10] with US$1\u00a0billion alone in infrastructure damages, making Idai the costliest tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean basin.[14][15][16][17]"

        "content": "Cyclone Idai originated from an elongated circulation that the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office in R\u00e9union (MFR) began monitoring on 1 March. At that time, it was in the Mozambique Channel and was moving west-southwest, towards Africa's east coast.[18] The MFR continued to track the system over the next couple of days as it developed strong deep convection.[19] On 4 March, the MFR stated that Tropical Depression\u00a011 had formed off the east coast of Mozambique.[20] The depression slowly moved westward, making landfall in Mozambique later in the day.[21] The system retained its status as a tropical depression through its existence over land. Shortly after landfall, the system turned to the north. Over the next several days, Tropical Depression 11 performed a counterclockwise loop near the border of Malawi and Mozambique,[22] before turning eastward and re-emerging into the Mozambique Channel, early on 9 March.[23] On 8 March, at 22:00 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), noting a consolidating low-level circulation center and that the system was in a favourable environment with low wind shear and sea surface temperatures exceeding 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).[24] On 9 March, after Tropical Depression 11 had re-entered the Mozambique Channel, the JTWC issued its first warning on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 18S.[25] At 00:00 UTC on 10 March, the MFR upgraded the system to a moderate tropical storm and designated it as Idai, after an increase in organised convection and the development of banding features.[26] Idai then began a period of rapid intensification, with the MFR upgrading it to tropical cyclone status by 18:00 UTC. At the same time, the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[27] Additionally, the strengthening of a subtropical ridge to the southwest and the weakening of the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the north resulted in a decrease in the forward motion of the storm.[28] Around 12:00 UTC on 11 March, Idai reached its initial peak intensity as an intense tropical cyclone, the seventh storm of that intensity that season, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph). At that time, the MFR reported that the internal structure of the cyclone had improved, with an eye visible in infrared imagery.[29] Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph), the equivalent of a Category 4 major hurricane, although operationally, the JTWC classified Idai as a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone.[30] Soon afterward, Idai began a weakening trend as it entered an eyewall replacement cycle and experienced dry air entanglement.[31] It was also noted that Idai was tracking towards the southwest, under the increasing influence of the subtropical ridge to the north.[32] On 12 March at 06:00 UTC, Idai bottomed out at tropical cyclone status with 10-minute winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph). At that time, the MFR noted that Idai had a poorly defined eye, as the eyewall replacement cycle was still underway.[33] Over the next day, Idai's intensity changed very little due to ongoing structural changes within its inner core. At the same time, Idai began to travel in a westerly direction.[34] By 18:00 UTC on 13 March, Idai had developed a large eye and taken on the characteristics of an annular tropical cyclone.[35] Six hours later, Idai reached peak intensity, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg).[36] At that time, the JTWC also reported that Idai had reached peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph).[37] Soon afterward, Idai began to weaken, due to lower sea surface temperatures and vertical wind shear as it neared the coast of Mozambique.[38] At 00:00 UTC on 15 March, the MFR reported that Idai had made landfall near Beira, Mozambique, with 10-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph).[39] Shortly afterward, the JTWC issued its final warning on Idai, stating that the cyclone had diminishing eyewall convection and warming cloud tops.[40] Idai quickly weakened after landfall; at 06:00 UTC that day, the MFR declared that Idai had degenerated into an overland depression, with gale-force winds as it continued to move inland.[41] Six hours later, the MFR issued its last warning on Idai. At that time, it was forecast that Idai's circulation would persist for several more days, and would drop heavy rainfall throughout the region during that time.[42] The MFR continued to monitor Idai for the next few days, with Idai degenerating into a remnant low late on 16 March. On 17 March, the MFR noted that only a wide clockwise circulation remained over eastern Zimbabwe, though rain from Idai's remnant was still affecting the entire region.[43] On the same day, Idai's remnants turned eastward once again, eventually re-emerging into the Mozambique Channel a second time on 19 March.[44] Idai's remnants encountered unfavourable conditions and rapidly weakened thereafter, dissipating late on 21 March over the Mozambique Channel.[7][8]"

Much of this land near the landfall area was near-harvest, compounding the risk of food shortages and placing the country at high-risk of famine.[59][60] Making landfall in Mozambique near Beira, Idai produced a storm surge of 4.4\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft) in the city. Coupled with torrential rains, including earlier rainfall, disastrous flooding ensued in the region.[61] Officials called the extensive flooded areas \"an inland ocean\"[62] visible even from outer space.[63] More than 500,000\u00a0people in the city, the majority of the population, lost power.[64] Rainfall in the city exceeded 200\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in), while the heaviest totals of more than 600\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) fell near Chimoio.[61] As of 19 March, 100,000 people were reported as requiring rescue in the Beira area.[65] The IFRC reported that 90% of the area in Beira was totally destroyed.[66] Communications in the city were crippled and all roads out were rendered impassable. All 17 of the city's hospitals and health centers suffered damage.[47] The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies described damage in the region as \"massive and horrifying\" and the President of Mozambique stated that over 1,000\u00a0people may have died. Bodies were found floating in floodwaters in Beira days after the storm hit.[11] A tsunami-like wave of water devastated Nhamatanda, sweeping many people to their deaths and destroying the town. People scrambled to rooftops in order to survive.[12] Days after landfall, the Buzi and Pungwe rivers in central Mozambique overflowed their banks.[67] Unprecedented flooding ensued along the banks of the Buzi River.[60] President Filipe Nyusi stated \"whole villages [disappeared]\" along the Buzi and Pungwe banks. On 17 March, rivers in the western provinces of Mozambique were hit with floodwaters from rising rivers.[68] The city of B\u00fazi continued to flood as of 20 March, placing its 200,000\u00a0residents at high-risk.[69] On 19 March, a 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) section of the Buzi remained flooded.[65] Thousands of people remained trapped on rooftops four days after Idai made landfall.[70] Floodwaters estimated to be 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) submerged entire communities.[71]"

In many instances, victims had to be abandoned in fatal conditions in order to save others in more dire need.[12] The National Disasters Management Institute, normally considered capable of handling disasters in Mozambique, could not cope with the scale of the disaster. The agency deployed boats and helicopters to save residents. Inadequate assistance left thousands of victims stranded in trees and on rooftops five days after the cyclone hit. Beira remained largely inaccessible through 20 March with infrastructure devastated and floodwaters yet to recede.[69] The Mozambique Minister of Land and Environment, Celso Correia, stated on 21 March that an estimated 15,000 people still required rescue.[84] A total of 128,941\u00a0people were displaced to 143\u00a0evacuation centers nationwide,[58] often in extremely poor conditions.[85] Three-fourths of the displaced persons reside in Sofala Province where the cyclone made its second landfall.[58] It was reported on 23 March that many local emergency centers in Mozambique had only recently been supplied with food, and some areas remained cut off.[86] Malawi President Peter Mutharika declared a state of emergency for affected districts on 8 March prompting mobilisation of the Malawian Defence Force.[73][72][74] The government estimated $16.4 million was needed to ease the effects of damage due to flooding.[87] Initial estimates placed the number of people in urgent need of aid at 120,000, primarily in the Chikwawa, Nsanje, Zomba, Mulanje, Phalombe, and Mangochi districts. With the support of the Danish Red Cross, the Malawi Red Cross Society provided K18\u00a0million (US$25,000) worth of supplies to displaced persons on 11 March.[88] On 11 March, the Malawi Revenue Authority provided K21\u00a0million (US$29,000) worth of supplies\u2013in the form of 7.5\u00a0tonnes of maize flour, 500 bales of sugar, and 20\u00a0tonnes of salt\u2013and gave a monetary donation of K2\u00a0million (US$3,000).[89] Local officials established 187\u00a0evacuation camps while churches and schools were utilised as makeshift shelters. However, these lacked adequate capacity and many people were forced to sleep in the open. Through 18 March, large portions of Chikwawa and Nsanje districts remained inaccessible by land; helicopters and boats were utilised to deliver supplies to these areas.[74] Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared a state of emergency soon after the storm and deployed the National Army and Air Force. A command center was established in Harare by 17 March to co-ordinate rescue and relief efforts. Persistent heavy rain, continued flooding, and mudslides hampered relief efforts, leaving many residents stranded without assistance. Harare Councilor Jacon Mafume called the event a \"serious humanitarian crisis\" and called upon the state for \"intervention on a massive scale to avoid biblical disaster\".[81] The Government of Zimbabwe allocated RTGS$50\u00a0million for emergency response and reconstruction. Medical supplies were sent to Mutare; however, damaged infrastructure hampered distribution. Residents established collection centers in Bulawayo and Harare.[82] Some affected areas remain difficult to reach as of 22 March, including Chimanimani.[90] Mnangagwa declared that Zimbabwe would begin two days of mourning for victims of the cyclone on 23 March.[91] On 4 April 2019, Zimbabwe Cricket announced that all the profits from the third One Day International (ODI) match between Zimbabwe and the United Arab Emirates would go to the relief efforts.[92]"

In one instance Stephen Fonseca, the forensic coordinator for Africa with the Red Cross, found a piece of a spine and a few bones of a child. Fonseca found bodies mangled in treetops where the victims attempted to escape rising waters. Small villages quickly buried the dead, likely without reporting to the government, including those washed in from Zimbabwe. Cadaver dogs were utilized to locate remains across flooded farmlands. The exact death toll is not expected to ever be known between the decomposition of bodies, consumption by animals, and unreported burials. Identification of some recovered remains is near impossible due to a lack of forensic reference records for some victims.[93] In order to facilitate DNA identification where reference material was available, on July 15, 2019,  Collen Masimirembwa, Chief Scientific Officer of the African Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology requested a computer and software system to facilitate forensic DNA identification of victims in Zimbabwe and Mozambique.[94]   \nThe system, called M-FISys (pronounced like \"emphasis,\" an acronym for the Mass-Fatality Identification System), was originally developed to identify victims of the World Trade Center Disaster of September 11, 2001.[95][96][97]"

On 1\u00a0April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953\u00a0cholera vaccines and 900,000\u00a0bed nets to Mozambique. The agency's vaccination campaign began in earnest on 3\u00a0April.[129] Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55\u00a0health centers destroyed in the region.[128] Beira's main hospital suffered extensive damage, rendering six of its seven operating theaters unusable.[132]"

        "content": "This massive tornado formed approximately twenty miles southwest of Natchez, shortly before 1 p.m., and moved northeast along the Mississippi River. It followed the river directly, stripping forests from both shores. The vortex then struck the river-port of Natchez Landing, located below the bluff from Natchez. This windstorm tossed 116\u00a0flatboats (of the 120\u00a0docked at Natchez that day) into the river, drowning their crews and passengers. Other boats were picked up and thrown onto land. A piece of a steamboat window was reportedly found 30 miles (48\u00a0km) from the river. Many doing business on shore were also killed. At Natchez Landing, the destruction of dwellings, stores, steamboats and flatboats was almost complete. It then moved into the town of Natchez, though its full width of devastation also included the river and the Louisiana village of Vidalia. It was reported, \"the air was black with whirling eddies of walls, roofs, chimneys and huge timbers from distant ruins ... all shot through the air as if thrown from a mighty catapult.\" The central and northern portions of Natchez were slammed by the funnel and many buildings were completely destroyed. Forty-eight\u00a0people were killed on land, and 269\u00a0others were killed on the river.[2] Numerous other deaths may have occurred further along the path as the tornado struck rural portions of Concordia Parish, Louisiana as well. The Free Trader stated, \"Reports have come in from plantations 20 miles distant in Louisiana, and the rage of the tempest was terrible. Hundreds of (slaves) killed, dwellings swept like chaff from their foundations, the forest uprooted, and the crops beaten down and destroyed. Never, never, never, was there such desolation and ruin.\""

In addition to the 317\u00a0deaths, only 109\u00a0were injured, a testament to the tornado's intensity. The tornado is to this day ranked as the second deadliest in American history, and caused $1,260,000\u00a0in damage. The actual death toll may be higher than what is listed, as slave deaths were often not counted during this time period. Senate Document No. 199 (27th Congress, 2nd Session) was the report of the commission to fix the demarcation between the United States and the Republic of Texas. In the Journal of the Joint Commission under date of May\u00a026, 1840, at page 62 of said document, is written the following:\n\"We crossed to-day the path of a recent tornado, which had prostrated trees and cane on the river banks. Its course was observed to be from south 72 degrees west to north 72 degrees east, and the track to be from 300\u2013400 yards [270\u2013370 meters] wide. This was supposed to be the same tornado which occasioned such dreadful destruction of human lives and houses in Natchez on the 7th of May.\" These observations were made on the Sabine River, which is the boundary between Louisiana and Texas. Regarding a final death count, CNN reported \"The official death toll may not have included slaves, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\"[3]"

It was the twelfth tropical cyclone and eighth tropical storm of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, forming on September 15 east of the Windward Islands. After degenerating into a tropical wave, the system produced flooding and mudslides in Puerto Rico. It reformed into a tropical depression on September 19 south of Cuba, and crossed the western portion of the island the next day while on the verge of dissipation. However, it intensified into a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, reaching its peak intensity while approaching the northern Gulf Coast. The storm rapidly weakened before moving ashore near Fort Walton Beach, Florida on September 22. It produced heavy rainfall along the Florida Panhandle that reached 9.56\u00a0in (243\u00a0mm). The rains flooded hundreds of houses and caused the Sopchoppy River to reach a record crest. Gusty winds left about 5,000\u00a0people without power, though the rains alleviated drought conditions. In South Carolina, Helene spawned a tornado that killed one person and injured six others; heavy rainfall in the state also led to a death when a driver hydroplaned into a tree. The rainfall extended northeastward into Delaware. Overall damage in the United States was estimated at $16\u00a0million. Helene emerged from North Carolina as a tropical storm, and re-intensified to near-hurricane strength before being absorbed by a cold front on September 25."

        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the African coast on September 10. Shortly thereafter, it lost most of its atmospheric convection and initially showed few signs of development as it moved westward. On September 14, convection reformed near the center of the system. It continued to organize, and the next day the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified it as Tropical Depression Twelve.[1] At the time, it was located 470\u00a0mi (765\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands.[2] By this point, the depression had a weak circulation and ragged convection. An anticyclone to its north caused the depression to move generally to the west, and upper-level conditions were forecast to be favorable for intensification.[3] However, the circulation moved away from the main area of convection[4] before a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated that the depression degenerated into a tropical wave on September 16. Although there was not a closed circulation, the flight observed flight-level winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) to the north and east of the system.[1] The remnants of the depression continued westward, moving through the Lesser Antilles on September 17. Despite favorable conditions for redevelopment including low wind shear and warm ocean temperatures, the system remained a tropical wave as it moved across the Caribbean Sea. Late on September 19, another reconnaissance plane discovered a closed circulation to the northwest of Grand Cayman. Although there was minimal convection near the center, it organized enough to be re-classified as a tropical depression.[1] Upon redeveloping, the depression was moved west-northwestward around a large anticyclone to the east of Florida. Its circulation was broad, though the NHC anticipated further strengthening.[5] Conditions remained favorable for intensification, but instead the depression weakened as it approached Cuba.[6] Around 1200\u00a0UTC on September 20, it moved across the western tip of Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico with minimal thunderstorms near the center.[1] A few hours later, the NHC noted that \"the cyclone [was] on the verge of breaking open into an east-west oriented trough\". The agency did not discontinue advisories due to an increase in convection near the center, although no intensification was expected.[7] However, the system's circulation and convection became better organized,[8] and early on September 21 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Helene.[1] Upon becoming a tropical storm, Helene gradually turned to the north while rounding an anticyclone to its east.[9] It rapidly intensified after its upgrade, and reached its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) late on September 21.[1] The storm was small with an asymmetric wind field, and wind shear displaced the circulation from the deep convection.[9] Increasing wind shear prevented Helene from attaining hurricane status, and the storm began weakening on September 22 as it approached the northern Gulf Coast.[1] By 0900\u00a0UTC that day, strong wind shear moved the convection away from the center and toward the north and northeast. This prompted NHC forecaster Lixion Avila to remark, \"If I did not have a reconnaissance plane in the area, I would not know there was a tropical cyclone by just observing IR satellite imagery.\"[10] The storm made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida at 1200\u00a0UTC on September 22 after weakening from its peak intensity to winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[1] After moving ashore, an area of convection redeveloped over Helene's center and the circulation became well-defined on radar imagery. The storm accelerated to the northeast into the Westerlies,[11] and about six hours following its landfall, Helene weakened to tropical depression status after crossing into southeastern Alabama.[1] A few hours later, the NHC issued the last advisory on the system and transferred warnings to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center. Hurricane forecast models anticipated restrengthening, and due to the forecast track north of the Gulf Stream, the NHC predicted intensification as an extratropical cyclone. The agency noted that 1997's Tropical Storm Danny re-intensified in the same region as a tropical cyclone.[12] Despite strong wind shear, convection increased over Helene's center as the storm moved through North Carolina. Stations along the Outer Banks reported sustained winds up to 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). Satellite imagery and buoy data indicated that Helene re-intensified into a tropical storm inland over North Carolina. The storm emerged from the Virginia coast into an area of less wind shear, where conditions were thus more favorable for strengthening. The storm became compact over the northern Atlantic Ocean, with a diameter of 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km). Strong convection developed over the center on September 24, and the following day Helene re-attained its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) while southeast of Nova Scotia. The wind estimate was based on observations from the Neptune Olivine, a nearby ship that recorded 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) winds and a barometric pressure of 988\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg); because the ship was located to the south of the center, the storm's minimum pressure was estimated at 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). Helene continued moving rapidly to the east-northeast, and late on September 25 dissipated as it was absorbed by a cold front.[1]"

The watch was discontinued after the depression degenerated into a tropical wave. As a tropical wave, Helene moved through the Lesser Antilles with strong winds; gusts on Guadeloupe reached 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h). The system also produced heavy rainfall, reaching 3.14\u00a0in (80\u00a0mm) on Antigua. The wave passed to the south of Puerto Rico on September 17 and 18.[1] Across the southern and eastern portion of the island, the system produced 6 to 12\u00a0in (150 to 300\u00a0mm) of rainfall, which resulted in flash flooding and mudslides. One house was destroyed and more than 100\u00a0houses were affected in Ponce, forcing several families to evacuate. The flooding also destroyed a bridge in Guayama and made many roads impassable. Damage on the island was estimated at $100,000 (2000\u00a0USD).[13] After the system redeveloped into a tropical depression, the government of Cuba issued a tropical storm warning for the provinces of Isla de la Juventud, Havana, and Pinar del R\u00edo, as well as for the city of Havana.[1]"

Six hours later, the agency also issued a hurricane watch from the border of Florida and Alabama to the mouth of the Aucilla River.[1] The day before the storm moved ashore, local American Red Cross chapters had 18\u00a0emergency shelters on standby to house storm evacuees.[14] One shelter opened in Tallahassee and one in Apalachicola.[15] About 130\u00a0people evacuated to shelters in the western portion of the Florida panhandle[16] and planes evacuated military bases in the region. Government buildings were closed in Okaloosa, and schools were closed in Okaloosa, Walton, and Santa Rosa counties.[17] Despite being a weak tropical cyclone at landfall, Tropical Storm Helene caused $16\u00a0million in damage (2000\u00a0USD).[18] In Alabama, wind gusts reached 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) at Brookley Air Force Base in Mobile; the same station recorded the highest rainfall in the state, with a total of 1.08\u00a0in (27\u00a0mm). The storm also caused minor beach erosion and coastal damage along Dauphin Island.[13] In neighboring Florida, the storm dropped heavy rainfall along the panhandle, peaking at 9.56\u00a0in (243\u00a0mm) in Apalachicola. The rains caused flooding, notably in Franklin, Wakulla, and Leon counties, all of which closed schools and public buildings.[13] Flood warnings were issued for areas affected by Tropical Storm Gordon five days prior.[19] High rainfall caused the Sopchoppy River to exceed its banks and reach a record crest of 34.9\u00a0ft (10.6\u00a0m), breaking the previous record set in 1970. Several homes and nearby roads were flooded near the river. About 100\u00a0homes were flooded in Leon County, and 70\u00a0streets were flooded in Tallahassee. Portions of U.S. Highway 98 were flooded in Port St. Joe and near Carrabelle. About 70\u00a0people had to evacuate their homes due to the flooding. Flooding was minimal in the western Florida panhandle due to drought conditions the previous summer. Sustained winds across the state peaked at 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h), though gusts reached 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) at Cape San Blas.[13] At that location, there was over $100,000 in road damage and beach loss.[16] The winds combined with the heavy rainfall caused trees to fall onto power lines, leaving about 5,000\u00a0people without electricity.[13] The storm spawned 6\u00a0tornadoes along the panhandle,[16] one of which destroyed several mobile homes in Wakulla. As the storm moved ashore, tides were less than 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above normal, but were high enough to cause minor beach erosion.[13] In Leon County, the storm destroyed two homes and six mobile homes,[20] and damaged more than 120\u00a0homes in Wakulla County.[13] When Helene moved through Georgia, it had sustained winds of around 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h), with higher gusts.[13] It dropped heavy rainfall along its path, with a statewide peak of 5.13\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) in Dunwoody.[21] The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions across the state. However, the combination of winds and rainfall downed trees and power lines; one falling tree damaged a car in Sandersville.[13] To the northwest of Georgia, rainfall spread into Tennessee, reaching 3.12\u00a0in (79\u00a0mm) in Copperhill.[21] As Helene moved through South Carolina, it spawned an F2 tornado in Martin that killed one person, injured six, and damaged 12\u00a0houses.[1][22][23] The highest rainfall in the United States associated with Helene was a total of 9.60\u00a0in (244\u00a0mm) in Bamberg,[24] though weather radar images estimated totals of up to 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm). The rains caused flooding along Highway 47, in nearby Orangeburg County where 5.3\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) were recorded.[22] In Berkeley County, a woman died after hydroplaning and driving her car into a tree.[13] Rainfall in North Carolina peaked at 8.31\u00a0in (211\u00a0mm) in Longwood;[21] in Jacksonville, the precipitation caused street flooding.[25] Off the shore of North Carolina, a station at Diamond Shoal Light reported wind gusts of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) while Helene was re-intensifying into a tropical storm. Along the coast, the highest gusts were 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h), reported at both Cape Lookout and Duck.[1] Rainfall from the storm extended through Virginia and into Delaware.[26]"

On the other hand, the Arenes stream diverted its course in the blocks of the Sant Lloren\u00e7 groups and flowed through an old channel, devastating the current \u00c8gara neighborhood on the right bank, the triangle of death where it caused more than a hundred victims and demolished a large part of the houses. The total number of victims (and missing) is 372.[6]"

The flood took away the houses it found in its path. The Torre-romeu neighborhood, located in the northeast of the city, on the other side of the Ripoll and built largely on the river bed, was one of the most affected neighborhoods in Sabadell. Can Puigener was another of the neighborhoods that suffered the most from the flood. Also in the neighborhoods of Plana del Pintor or Campoamor the rain affected many houses. The industries located in the course of the river were also heavily damaged. The next day, 26 September, it was estimated that the flood had affected 80% of Sabadell's sizing and industrial leftovers industries, representing 40% of Spain's capacity. All factories were affected. Tintoreria Castell\u00f3 had inaugurated the building a few days ago and the machinery, which was new, was completely destroyed. Acabats Estruch, S.A., Tints i Aprestos Casanoves Argelaguet, S.A., Ramon Bux\u00f3 i fills, Ind\u00fastries Casablanques, S.A., Llorens i Torra, S.A., Grau, S.A., Sabadell T\u00e8xtil, S.A., among others were some of the industries affected in Sabadell.[7] The floods in Cerdanyola del Vall\u00e8s were not as severe since the Sec river and the Major river, the two rivers that flow through the town, did not receive the same amount as the Riera de les Arenes or the Ripoll river, thus, despite the numerous material losses, no fatalities were recorded. The families that lost their homes, basically in the Montflorit neighborhood, were relocated through the help they received from the City Council.[8]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Abby was an exceptionally small tropical cyclone that had minor effects across Southeast Texas in early August 1964. Forming as a tropical depression out of a trough south of Louisiana on August\u00a05, the system moved generally westward. It was not until August\u00a07 that the system began to organize. That day, an eye rapidly formed within the system and it became a tropical storm just 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Soon thereafter, a weather reconnaissance plane reported a barometric pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53\u00a0inHg) at the storm's center. Around 18:00\u00a0UTC (1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT), the newly named Abby attained peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h). It subsequently made landfall near Matagorda, Texas four hours later. Once onshore gradual weakening ensued, though a brief period of re-organization delayed its dissipation. Abby degenerated into an area of showers on August\u00a08 southwest of San Antonio, Texas. Prior to Abby's landfall in Texas, gale warnings were issued for the coast and residents on Matagorda Island were evacuated. Overall, the storm's impacts were limited due to its small size. Only two structures sustained damage in Matagorda, one being destroyed by a possible tornado, and the remaining effects resulted from flooding in Jackson and Victoria Counties. Total damage from the storm was estimated at $750,000 with the majority stemming from crops."

        "content": "On August\u00a05, 1964, a weak trough emerged from Florida over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.[1] According to the Atlantic hurricane database (referred to as HURDAT), the system developed into a tropical depression by 18:00\u00a0UTC (1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT) that day, with its center located roughly 160\u00a0mi (255\u00a0km) south-southeast of the Mississippi River Delta.[2] Moving generally west, the system exhibited no signs of further development as it neared the Texas coastline. However, on August\u00a07, radar images from Brownsville, Galveston, Lake Charles, and Victoria showed an abrupt increase in organization. During the afternoon hours, banding features consolidated around a developing eye and weather reconnaissance planes were dispatched to the system.[1] Forecasters initially mistook the eye as a hook echo-type feature at the end of a squall line.[3] It is estimated that the depression became a tropical storm by 12:00\u00a0UTC (7:00\u00a0a.m. CDT), roughly 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) southeast of Galveston, Texas.[2] Operationally, the system was not even monitored as a depression this time, with the classification and naming of Tropical Storm Abby occurring at 16:00\u00a0UTC (11:00\u00a0a.m. CDT) on August\u00a07.[4] Abby was an unusually small storm, with its entire circulation being far less than 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) in diameter.[1] Around 16:00\u00a0UTC (11:00\u00a0a.m. CDT) on August\u00a07,[4] reconnaissance measured a central barometric pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53\u00a0inHg) within Abby, the lowest in relation to the system. They also reported peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) in squalls, which would rank as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. These winds were seen to be an overestimate by forecasters and discarded, however. The system attained its maximum winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) by 18:00\u00a0UTC (1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT) and subsequently made landfall just northeast of Matagorda, Texas at 22:00\u00a0UTC (5:00\u00a0p.m. CDT).[1][2] Irvin Velbrecht, a forecaster at the Weather Bureau (now known as the National Weather Service) in Galveston, described the storm as a \"perfectly miniature hurricane.\"[5] Despite moving onshore, Abby's core continued to organize and it developed a closed eyewall roughly three hours later.[6] Thereafter the storm began to gradually weaken, passing over Edna around 02:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08 (9:00\u00a0p.m. CDT on August\u00a07).[7] Weakening to a depression hours later, Abby ultimately degenerated into an area of showers and dissipated southwest of San Antonio by 12:00\u00a0UTC (7:00\u00a0a.m. CDT).[1][2]"

        "header": "Preparations and impact",
        "content": "Owing to the abrupt nature of Abby's development on August\u00a07, residents had little time to prepare for the storm.[8] According to Irvin Velbrecht, \"in the absence of aircraft reconnaissance and radar information, two reasonably new tools in storm detection, Abby could well have formed and approached the shore before knowledge of a tropical storm was gained.\"[5][9] Gale warnings were raised from Galveston to San Antonio immediately following the storm's formation and were kept in place through the morning of August\u00a08.[10] Evacuation orders were issued for Matagorda Island and most complied, with some deciding to remain at their homes.[8] Personnel at Matagorda Island Air Force Base were evacuated to Victoria. Red Cross facilities were readied and public shelters were opened in the area.[11] At the mouth of the Colorado River, seagoing vessels were tied down with extra rope.[12] Within the Weather Bureau, members of the Galveston office were the first to notice the system and relayed to the other offices in the area to attune their radars to follow the system.[6] Abby's small size resulted in its effects being limited to areas within the immediate track. Sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) were measured by the Army Corps of Engineers in Matagorda.[1] Near the town, a possible tornado unroofed a barn and tossed the structure 225\u00a0ft (69\u00a0m); this building previously had withstood the effects of Hurricane Carla in 1961.[8] Winds estimated at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) tore part of the roof off a fishing warehouse in Matagorda itself.[12] Along the coast, tides ranged from 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) above normal from Matagorda to Freeport.[1] Four men and five dogs required rescue after their vessel became stranded on the Colorado River.[12] Heavy rains accompanied the system across Texas.[1] Most areas along the immediate track received at least 3 to 5\u00a0in (76 to 127\u00a0mm) of rain, with a peak value of 6.14\u00a0in (156\u00a0mm) recorded at the Victoria International Airport.[13] The hardest hit areas were in Jackson and Victoria counties where the heaviest rains fell. In these areas, flooding and strong winds damaged the cotton and rice crops;[7] however, effects of the rice crop were more limited due to losses from earlier storms as well as ongoing harvesting.[12] Some flooding also took place across the Atascosa River watershed, but no damage resulted. Overall, property damage was estimated at $150,000 while agricultural losses reached $600,000.[7]"
