        "content": " The 1970 Bhola cyclone (also known as the Great Cyclone of 1970[1]) was a catastrophic and extremely deadly tropical cyclone that struck East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) and India's West Bengal on 12 November 1970.[2] It remains the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded and one of the world's deadliest humanitarian disasters. At least 300,000 people died in the storm, possibly as many as 450,000, primarily as a result of the storm surge that flooded much of the low-lying islands of the Ganges Delta. Bhola was the sixth and strongest cyclonic storm of the 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season.[3] The cyclone formed over the central Bay of Bengal on 8 November and traveled northward, intensifying as it did so. It reached its peak with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) on 10 November, and made landfall on the coast of East Pakistan on the following afternoon. The storm surge devastated many of the offshore islands, wiping out villages and destroying crops throughout the region. In the most severely affected upazila Tazumuddin, over 45% of the population of 167,000 were killed by the storm. The Pakistani government, led by junta leader General Yahya Khan, was criticized for its delayed handling of relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and by the international media. The poor and discriminatory response from the West Pakistan government led to the increasingly widespread disillusionment from the East Pakistani people, allowing the opposition Awami League to gain a landslide victory in the province during the election that took place a month later as well as the Bangladesh Liberation War 7 months later."

        "content": "On 1 November, Tropical Storm Nora developed over the South China Sea, in the West Pacific Ocean. The system lasted for four days, before degenerating into a remnant low over the Gulf of Thailand on 4 November, and subsequently moved west over the Malay Peninsula the next day.[4][5] The remnants of this system contributed to the development of a new depression in the central Bay of Bengal on the morning of 8 November. The depression intensified as it moved slowly northward, and the India Meteorological Department upgraded it to a cyclonic storm the next day. No country in the region had ever named tropical cyclones during this time, so no new identity was given.[6] The storm became nearly stationary that evening near 14.5° N, 87° E, but began to accelerate toward the north on 10 November.[6] The storm further intensified into a severe cyclonic storm on 11 November and began to turn towards the northeast, as it approached the head of the bay. It developed a clear eye and reached its peak intensity later that day, with three-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), one-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph),[7] and a central pressure of 960 hPa. The cyclone made landfall on the East Pakistan coastline during the evening of 12 November, around the same time as the local high tide. Once over land, the system began to weaken; the storm degraded to a cyclonic storm on 13 November, when it was about 100 km (62 mi) south-southeast of Agartala. The storm then rapidly weakened into a remnant low over southern Assam that evening.[6]"

        "content": "There is question as to how much of the information about the cyclone said to have been received by Indian weather authorities was transmitted to East Pakistan authorities. This is because the Indian and East Pakistani weather services may not have shared information given the Indo-Pakistani friction at the time.[8] A large part of the population was reportedly taken by surprise by the storm.[9] There were indications that East Pakistan's storm warning system was not used properly.[10] The Pakistan Meteorological Department issued a report calling for \"danger preparedness\" in the vulnerable coastal regions during the day on 12 November. As the storm neared the coast, a \"great danger signal\" was broadcast on Radio Pakistan. Survivors later said that this meant little to them, but that they had recognised a No. 1 warning signal as representing the greatest possible threat.[11] Following two previously destructive cyclones in October 1960 which killed at least 16,000 people in East Pakistan,[12] the Pakistani central government contacted the American government for assistance in developing a system to avert future disasters. Gordon Dunn, the director of the National Hurricane Center at the time, carried out a detailed study and submitted his report in 1961. However, the central government did not carry out all of the recommendations Dunn had listed.[8]"

The exact death toll from the Bhola cyclone will never be known, but at least 300,000 fatalities were associated with the storm,[13][5] possibly as many as 500,000.[14] The Bhola cyclone is the deadliest tropical cyclone on record and also one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history. A comparable number of people died as a result of the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake, but because of uncertainty in the number of deaths in all four disasters, it may never be known which one was the deadliest.[15]"

        "content": "The meteorological station in Chittagong, 95 km (59 mi) to the east of where the storm made landfall, recorded winds of 144 km/h (89 mph) before its anemometer was blown off at about 2200 UTC on 12 November. A ship anchored in the port in the same area recorded a peak gust of 222 km/h (138 mph) about 45 minutes later.[5] As the storm made landfall, it caused a 10-metre (33 ft) high storm surge at the Ganges Delta.[20] In the port at Chittagong, the storm tide peaked at about 4 m (13 ft) above the average sea level, 1.2 m (3.9 ft) of which was the storm surge.[5] Radio Pakistan reported that there were no survivors on the thirteen islands near Chittagong. A flight over the area showed the devastation was complete throughout the southern half of Bhola Island, and the rice crops of Bhola Island, Hatia Island and the nearby mainland coastline were destroyed.[21] Several seagoing vessels in the ports of Chittagong and Mongla were reported damaged, and the airports at Chittagong and Cox's Bazar were under 1 m (3.3 ft) of water for several hours.[22] Over 3.6 million people were directly affected by the cyclone, and the total damage from the storm was estimated at US$86.4 million (US$701 million in 2024).[23] The survivors claimed that approximately 85% of homes in the area were destroyed or severely damaged, with the greatest destruction occurring along the coast.[24]: 9  Ninety percent of marine fishermen in the region suffered heavy losses, including the destruction of 9,000 offshore fishing boats. Of the 77,000 onshore fishermen, 46,000 were killed by the cyclone, and 40% of the survivors were affected severely. In total, approximately 65% of the fishing capacity of the coastal region was destroyed by the storm, in a region where about 80% of the protein consumed comes from fish. Agricultural damage was similarly severe with the loss of US$63 million worth of crops and 280,000 cattle.[5] Three months after the storm, 75% of the population was receiving food from relief workers, and over 150,000 relied upon aid for half of their food.[24]: 11 The Bhola Cyclone would also lead to increased cholera and typhoid cases in the region due to the contamination of the water supply in the storm. Many attempts of sending aid to the region were impeded by the prevalent cholera, and as a result, medical aid was delayed.[25]"

Port Blair recorded 130 mm (5.1 in) of rain on 8 November, and there were a number of floods on the islands. MV Mahajagmitra, a 5,500-ton freighter en route from Calcutta to Kuwait, was sunk by the storm on 12 November with the loss of all fifty people on board. The ship sent out a distress signal and reported experiencing hurricane-force winds before it sank.[6][26] There was also widespread rain in West Bengal and southern Assam. The rain caused damage to housing and crops in both Indian states, with the worst damage occurring in the southernmost districts.[6]"

        "content": "Two medical relief surveys were carried out by the Pakistan-SEATO Cholera Research Laboratory: the first in November and the second in February and March. The purpose of the first survey was to establish the immediate medical needs in the affected regions, and the second, more detailed, survey was designed as the basis for long-term relief and recovery planning. In the second survey, approximately 1.4% of the area's population was studied.[24]: 6 The first survey concluded that the surface water in most of the affected regions had a comparable salt content to that drawn from wells, except in Sudharam, where the water was almost undrinkable with a salt content of up to 0.5%. The mortality was estimated at 14.2%—equivalent to a death toll of 240,000.[24]: 5  Cyclone-related morbidity was generally restricted to minor injuries, but a phenomenon dubbed \"cyclone syndrome\" was observed. This consisted of severe abrasions on the limbs and chest caused by survivors clinging to trees to withstand the storm surge.[24]: 5  Initially, there were fears of an outbreak of cholera and typhoid fever in the weeks following the storm,[27] but the survey found no evidence of an epidemic of cholera, smallpox, or any other disease in the region affected by the storm.[24]: 5 The totals from the second survey were likely a considerable underestimate as several groups were not included— 100,000 migrant workers who were collecting the rice harvest, families who were completely wiped out by the storm, and those who had migrated out of the region in the intervening three months. Excluding these groups reduced the risk of hearsay and exaggeration.[24]: 6  The survey concluded that the overall death toll was, at minimum, 224,000. The worst effects were felt in Tazumuddin, where the mortality was 46.3%, corresponding to approximately 80,000 deaths in the thana alone. The mean mortality throughout the affected region was 16.5%.[24]: 7 The results showed that the highest survival rate was for adult males aged 15–49, while more than half the deaths were children under age 10, who only formed a third of the pre-cyclone population. This suggests that the young, old, and sick were at the highest risk of perishing in the cyclone and its storm surge. In the months after the storm, the mortality of the middle-aged was lower in the cyclone area than in the control region, near Dhaka. This reflected the storm's toll on the less healthy individuals.[24]: 7-8"

        "content": "There have been mistakes, there have been delays, but by and large I'm very satisfied that everything is being done and will be done. The days after the storm struck the coast, three Pakistani gunboats and a hospital ship carrying medical personnel and supplies left Chittagong for the islands of Hatiya, Sandwip and Kutubdia.[22] Teams from the Pakistani Army reached many of the stricken areas in the two days following the landfall of the cyclone.[29] President Khan visited East Pakistan on the way back from a trip to China. In a press conference in Dhaka, Khan accepted the government had made \"slips\" and \"mistakes\" in their relief effort for the cyclone victims of then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) but he insisted that \"everything was done within the limits of the Government.\" He then returned to Rawalpindi.[28] No West Pakistani political leaders visited the East.[30] In the ten and a half days following the cyclone, one military transport aircraft and three crop-dusting aircraft were assigned to relief work by the Pakistani central government.[31] The central government said it was unable to transfer military helicopters from West Pakistan as the Indian government did not grant clearance to cross the intervening Indian territory, a charge the Indian government denied.[27] By 24 November, the central government had allocated a further US$116 million to finance relief operations in the disaster area.[32] Khan arrived in Dhaka to take charge of the relief operations on 24 November. The governor of East Pakistan, Vice Admiral S. M. Ahsan, denied charges that the armed forces had not acted quickly enough and said supplies were reaching all parts of the disaster area except for some small pockets.[33] Khan said there was a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the disaster. He also said that the 1970 general election slated for 7 December would take place on time, although eight or nine of the worst affected districts might experience delays, denying rumours that the election would be postponed.[28] As the conflict between East and West Pakistan developed in March 1971, the Dhaka offices of the two government organisations directly involved in relief efforts were closed for at least two weeks, first by a general strike and then by a ban on government work in East Pakistan by the Awami League. Relief work continued in the field, but the long-term planning was curtailed.[34]"

        "content": "We have a large army, but it is left to the British Marines to bury our dead. Political leaders in East Pakistan were deeply critical of the central government's initial response to the disaster. A statement released by eleven East Pakistan politicians ten days after the storm charged the government with \"gross neglect, callous indifference and utter indifference\". They also accused President Khan of playing down the news coverage.[32] On November 19, students held a march in Dhaka in protest of the speed of the government response,[36] and Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani addressed a rally of 50,000 people on 24 November, when he accused the president of inefficiency and demanded his resignation. Khan's political opponents in West Pakistan accused him of bungling the efforts and some demanded his resignation.[33] Awami League leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman described the destruction caused by the cyclone akin to a \"Holocaust\" and condemned the military junta's response as \"criminal negligence\".[37] The Pakistan Red Crescent began to operate independently of the central government as the result of a dispute that arose after the Red Crescent took possession of twenty rafts donated by the British Red Cross.[38] A pesticide company had to wait two days before it received permission for two of its crop dusters, which were already in the country, to carry out supply drops in the affected regions. The central government only deployed a single helicopter to relief operations, with Khan later stating that there was no point deploying any helicopters from West Pakistan as they were unable to carry supplies.[11] A reporter for the Pakistan Observer spent a week in the worst hit areas in early January 1971 and saw none of the tents supplied by relief agencies being used to house survivors and commented that the grants for building new houses were insufficient. The Observer regularly carried front-page stories with headlines like, \"No Relief Coordination\", while publishing government statements saying, \"Relief operations are going smoothly.\" In January, the coldest period of the year in East Pakistan, the National Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, headed by the editor of Ittefaq, said thousands of survivors from the storm were \"passing their days under [the] open sky\". A spokesman said families who were made homeless by the cyclone were receiving up to 250 rupees (US$55 in 1971; equivalent to $341 in 2018) to rebuild, but that resources were scarce and he feared the survivors would \"eat the cash\".[39]"

The elections for nine national assembly and eighteen provincial assembly seats had to be postponed until January 18 as a result of the storm.[41] The central government's handling of the relief efforts helped exacerbate the bitterness felt in East Pakistan, swelling the resistance movement there. Funds only slowly got through, and transport was slow in bringing supplies to the devastated regions. As tensions increased in March 1971, foreign personnel evacuated because of fears of violence.[34] The situation deteriorated further and evolved into the subsequent genocide.[42]"

Six helicopters – two helicopters at an aid mission in Nepal and four from the U.S. – were also sent.[47] Some 200,000 tons of wheat were shipped from the U.S. to the stricken region.[39] By the end of November, there were 38 helicopters operating in the disaster area, ten of which were British and ten American. The Americans had provided about fifty small boats and the British seventy for supply distribution.[43] CARE halted aid shipments to East Pakistan the week after the cyclone hit because of unwillingness to let the Pakistani central government handle distribution.[38] However, by January 1971, they had reached an agreement to construct 24,000 cement brick houses at a cost of about $1.2 million ($9 million in 2024).[39] American concerns about delays by the central government in determining how the relief should be used meant that US$7.5 million ($61 million in 2024) of relief granted by the United States Congress had not been handed over in March. Much of the money was earmarked to be spent on constructing cyclone shelters and rebuilding housing.[34] The American Peace Corps offered to send volunteers but were rebuffed by the central government.[43] A Royal Navy task force, centred on HMS Intrepid and HMS Triumph, left Singapore for the Bay of Bengal to assist with the relief efforts. They carried eight helicopters and eight landing craft, as well as rescue teams and supplies.[46] Fifty soldiers and two helicopters were flown in ahead of the ships to survey the disaster area and bring relief work.[48] The task force arrived off the East Pakistan coast on 24 November, and the 650 troops aboard the ships immediately began using landing craft to deliver supplies to offshore islands.[33] An appeal by the British Disasters Emergency Committee raised about £1.5 million (£29 million in 2024) for disaster relief in East Pakistan.[43][49] The Canadian government pledged C$2 million of assistance. France and West Germany both sent helicopters and various supplies worth US$1.3 million.[43][48] Pope Paul VI announced that he would visit Dhaka during a visit to the Far East and urged people to pray for the victims of the disaster.[50] The Vatican later contributed US$100,000 to the relief efforts.[43] By the start of 1971, four Soviet helicopters were still operating in the region transporting essential supplies to hard-hit areas. The Soviet aircraft, which had drawn criticism from Bengalis, replaced the British and American helicopters that had operated immediately after the cyclone.[39] The government of Singapore sent a military medical mission to East Pakistan which arrived at Chittagong on 1 December. They were then deployed to Sandwip where they treated nearly 27,000 people and carried out a smallpox vaccination effort. The mission returned to Singapore on 22 December, after bringing about $50,000 worth of medical supplies and fifteen tons of food for the victims of the storm.[51] The Japanese cabinet approved a total of US$1.65 million of relief funds in December. The Japanese government had previously drawn criticism for only donating a small amount to relief work.[52] The first shipment of Chinese supplies was a planeload of 500,000 doses of cholera vaccine, which was not necessary as the country had adequate stocks.[44] The Chinese government sent US$1.2 million in cash to Pakistan.[43] Mohammad Reza Pahlavi declared that the disaster was also an Iranian one and responded by sending two planeloads of supplies within a few days of the cyclone striking.[36] Many smaller, poorer Asian nations sent nominal amounts of aid.[43] The United Nations donated US$2.1 million in food and cash, while UNICEF began a drive to raise a further million.[43] UNICEF helped to re-establish water supplies in the wake of the storm, repairing over 11,000 wells in the months following the storm.[53] UN Secretary-General U Thant made appeals for aid for the victims of the cyclone and the civil war in August, in two separate relief programs. He said only about $4 million had been contributed towards immediate needs, well short of the target of US$29.2 million.[54] By the end of November, the League of Red Cross Societies had collected US$3.5 million to supply aid to the victims of the disaster.[43] The World Bank estimated that it would cost US$185 million to reconstruct the area devastated by the storm. The bank drew up a comprehensive recovery plan for the Pakistani government. The plan included restoring housing, water supplies and infrastructure to their pre-storm state. It was designed to combine with a much larger ongoing flood-control and development program.[55] The bank provided US$25 million of credit to help rebuild the East Pakistan economy and to construct protective shelters in the region. This was the first time that the IDA had provided credit for reconstruction.[56] By the start of December, nearly US$40 million had been raised for the relief efforts by the governments of 41 countries, organizations and private groups.[55]"

A Red Cross official stated some of the relief workers sent to East Pakistan were poorly trained, and the organisation would compile a list of specialists. The UN General Assembly adopted a proposal to improve its ability to provide aid to disaster-stricken countries. In 1966, the Red Crescent had begun to support the development of a cyclone warning system, which developed into a Cyclone Preparedness Programme in 1972, today run by the government of Bangladesh and the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society. The programme's objectives are to raise public awareness of the risks of cyclones and to provide training to emergency personnel in the coastal regions of Bangladesh.[58] In the thirty years after the 1970 cyclone, over 200 cyclone shelters were constructed in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. When the next destructive cyclone approached the country in 1991, volunteers from the Cyclone Preparedness Programme warned people of the cyclone two to three days before it struck land. Over 350,000 people fled their homes to shelters and other brick structures, while others sought high ground. While the 1991 cyclone killed over 138,000 people, this was significantly less than the 1970 storm, partly because of the warnings sent out by the Cyclone Preparedness Programme. However, the 1991 storm was significantly more destructive, causing US$1.5 billion (equivalent to $3 billion in 2023) compared to the 1970 storm's $0.086 billion (equivalent to $0.52 billion in 2023).[59][60] Footage of the incident appeared in the film Days of Fury (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky and hosted by Vincent Price.[61]"

It soon moved over land, re-emerging off the Northern Territory coast on 3 December. Late on 4 December, the low reached tropical cyclone status, receiving the name Amelia as it moved west-southwest through the Timor Sea. Soon afterwards, however, the system fell below cyclone intensity. It drifted west-southwest over the next few days, dissipating on 6 December.[1]"

It moved westward and intensified, becoming a cyclone later that day, although it did not receive a name. At 1400 UTC on 20 December, it made landfall near Gove at its peak intensity with winds of 85 km/h (55 mph) and a minimum pressure of 990 hPa. The strongest winds were likely in the southern quadrants due to its rapid westward movement. The cyclone weakened as it moved over land, but emerged offshore near Darwin on the 21st. Now over water, it once again intensified to tropical cyclone intensity, reaching a secondary peak intensity with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) and a pressure of 992 hPa. The system dissipated on 23 December. At Gove, sustained winds of 115 km/h and gusts of over 148 km/h were recorded, the highest from the system. Extensive tree damage occurred in the Gove area, and some minor damage to ships occurred at the Nabalco Wharf.[2]"

The system reached cycle intensity at 00:00 UTC on 7 January, receiving the name Chris. Over the next few days, Chris moved generally westwards as it steadily deepened, steered by a strong anticyclone located south of the storm. On 9 January, Chris passed 90°E and moved into the Météo-France area of responsibility, where it was renamed Damia.[3] The system would later become the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the South-West Indian Ocean at the time, with an estimated pressure of 898 hPa (mbar).[4]"

        "header": "Tropical Cyclone Bruno",
        "content": "On 10 January, a weak tropical low formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria from a monsoon trough. The low drifted slowly westwards, crossing the coast near Maningrida late on the 14th. Despite moving over land, the system continued to organise and reached cyclone intensity at 18:00 UTC on 15 January, while the centre was located near Wadeye. The storm, now named Bruno, continued to develop over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf and reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 90 km/h (55 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 989 hPa (mbar) late on the 15th. Bruno made another landfall again at about 07:00 UTC on 16 January, turning towards the southwest and steadily weakening, although it continued to produce gale-force winds as it moved through the West Kimberley. After Bruno passed Port Hedland, the system moved out to sea and rapidly reintensified. Bruno reached its ultimate peak intensity at 15:00 UTC on 19 January, with winds of 90 km/h (55 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 980 hPa (mbar). The storm once again made landfall in the Exmouth Gulf later that day. A weakened Bruno moved out to sea again the next day but the system made its final landfall south of Perth on January 22 and dissipated soon after. Bruno caused torrential rainfall to many areas of Western Australia, especially in the southwest where some stations set records for January rainfall. Severe flooding occurred in the southwest, with the Blackwood River reaching its highest level in over 25 years. Many bridges were washed away and there was extensive road and rail damage. A number of towns were flooded, with 75 houses being flooded in Nannup. Total damage was estimated at $10 million (1982 AUD, $10.9 million 1982 USD).[5]"

The system was first identified on 11 January. It drifted southeast and became a tropical cyclone at 09:00 UTC the next day. Daphne-Fifi slowly intensified as it moved towards the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Curving towards the east, Daphne-Fifi reached its peak intensity early on 16 January with peak winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 986 hPa (mbar). On the 19th, the system accelerated towards the southeast and weakened, dissipating a few days later as it crossed the Western Australian coast.

Errol slowly intensified over the coming days, reaching its peak intensity on 15 January with winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 980 hPa (mbar) as it recurved towards the southeast. After peaking, the storm weakened and Errol merged with Cyclone Bruno on the 18 January.[7] The storm caused flood damage in Western Australia.[8]"

For the next 3 days, the low moved northeast, and then northwest, slowly intensifying. On 25 January, the low turned towards the southeast, becoming a cyclone the following night. During the next 3 days, Abigail executed a cyclonic loop, and it made another major turn towards the east-northeast on the 30th. Abigail reached its highest intensity in the Australian region on 1 February with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 975 hPa (mbar), moving out of the basin immediately after. Abigail caused no damage or fatalities in the Australian region.[9]"

Moving eastward, it reached cyclone status before it made landfall in the Kimberley Region the next day. Weakening to a tropical low, it recurved to the west on the 29th, steered by a developing ridge of high pressure. Early on January 31, the low moved out to sea and quickly redeveloped before once again turning to the southwest and nearing the coast. Just before it made its second landfall near Port Hedland, Graham peaked with winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 980 hPa (mbar). During the January 28–30 period, Graham caused extensive landfall over the Kimberley, with 178 mm recorded in Broome during a 24-hour period ending at 01:00 UTC on the 30th. After its second landfall, building and tree damage was reported at Pardoo Station."

        "content": " The 1981–82 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was a destructive and deadly cyclone season that occurred in Madagascar, where four cyclones killed 100 people and caused $250 million (USD) in damage. The season was fairly active, lasting from October to May. There were nine named storms that attained gale-force winds, or at least 65 km/h (40 mph). Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, which have 10-minute sustained winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph). The first storm was Tropical Cyclone Alex, which was named by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). this was due to the boundary of the basin at the time, which incorporated the Indian Ocean south of the equator and extended from the east coast of Africa to 80° E; the eastern extent was later moved to 90° E. Two other storms – Armelle and Damia – also originated in the Australian basin. The latter was the strongest cyclone on record in the basin at the time by barometric pressure, estimated at 898 mbar (26.52 inHg). The first storm to affect Madagascar was Benedicte in December, and was followed by tropical storms Frida and Electre in February and Justine in March. The final storm of the season was Cyclone Karla, which remained in the eastern periphery of the basin while reaching winds of 170 km/h (105 mph)."

        "content": "Météo-France's meteorological office at Réunion (MFR) issued advisories for storms in the basin during the year. At the time, the MFR area of warning responsibility was from the coast of Africa to 80° E, and the agency primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones.[1] The nine tropical storms and five tropical cyclones was identical to the long-term average from 1981 to 2011.[2] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region,[3] also issued advisories for storms in the year. The agency tracked a tropical depression in July 1982. The system formed on July 4 southeast of Seychelles, and initially curved to the southwest. It failed to intensify beyond winds of 55 km/h (35 mph), and dissipated on July 4 after turning to the northwest.[4] At the time, the annual tropical cyclone year was from August 1 to July 31 of the subsequent year.[1] Four storms struck Madagascar in the season between December and March,[5] collectively killing 100 people and causing $250 million (1982 United States dollars) in damage.[6] The storms caused widespread flooding and a state of disaster for four months, compounded by floods in January. About 180,000 people were forced to evacuate, and there were increased levels of flood-related diseases. The storms closed down many roads and destroyed widespread crops, forcing the government to import 400,000 metric tons of rice. After the floods, workers repaired damaged roads and dykes while the government provided relief supplies. However, the ongoing floods strained the Madagascar's resources, and the government appealed for aid to the international community on February 4. The United States Agency for International Development provided nearly $9 million in aid, mostly for rice and rebuilding roads. Other countries donated about $7.5 million in money or relief goods, such as building materials, food, clothing, and medicine.[7]"

On October 18, a low-pressure area formed, based on reports from nearby ships. It moved southeastward and slowly intensified, given the name Alex.[8] Located southwest of Sumatra, the storm curved to the south.[9] Late on October 21, Alex attained peak winds of 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph), or above tropical cyclone status. For several days, it maintained much of its intensity while curving to the southwest. The storm eventually weakened due to strong wind shear deteriorating the convection. On October 27, Alex dissipated.[8][9] The storm developed east of 80° E but west of 90° E, which at the time was part of the warning responsibility for the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM).[8] However, the MFR expanded its area of responsibility to 90° E in 1985.[1]"

On November 6, the system strengthened enough for the BoM to name it Bessi while the storm was west of 90° E.[10] The MFR began tracking the storm on November 8 once it reached 85° E, estimating winds of 100 km/h (60 mph).[11] Two days later, a nearby ship reported winds of 63 km/h (39 mph).[10] During this time, the storm moved generally west-southwestward, crossing 80° E on November 11;[11] at that time, the Mauritius Meteorology Service renamed it Armelle.[10] The storm continued westward and gradually weakened. On November 18, Armell deteriorated to tropical depression status, dissipating two days later between Tromelin Island and the Seychelles.[11]"

        "content": "In the middle of December, the ITCZ was active across the southern Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar. A circulation developed on December 16,[12] which preceded the development of a tropical disturbance on December 17.[13] Moving to the west-northwest, the system slowly developed before shifting to the southwest. On December 19, the system intensified into a moderate tropical storm while passing 75 km (45 mi) north of Madagascar. After briefly developing an eye feature, the satellite presentation degraded due to land interaction. Convection increased as the storm progressed through the Mozambique Channel, and the Madagascar Meteorological Service named it Benedicte on December 20. The organization improved over the next few days as the eye feature became better defined. On December 23, Benedicte intensified to tropical cyclone status, reaching peak winds of 135 km/h (85 mph). That day, the storm turned westward toward the Mozambique coast, weakening as it approached land. Benedicte made landfall on central Mozambique on December 24 and turned northward, straddling the border with Malawi. The storm dissipated on the next day, with only a remnant area of clouds present on satellite imagery by December 26.[12][13] While passing just north of Madagascar, Benedicte brought wind gusts of 252 km/h (157 mph) to Antsiranana, with several other localities reporting gale-force winds. Antsiranana also reported 178 mm (7.0 in).[12] The storm damaged thousands of homes and wrecked much of the region's coffee and pepper crops. Benedicte killed 13 people and was the first in a succession of six storms that flooded the country.[7]"

        "content": "Toward the end of December, strong convection persisted southeast of Diego Garcia. These storms consolidated into a distinct center on December 29, warranting its classification as a tropical depression. For several days the system meandered – it moved northward on December 30 due to a ridge to the south, although soon thereafter turned back to the south and later to the west. Due to a Dvorak rating of 2.5, the Mauritius Meteorology Service named the system Clarisse. According to the MFR, the system only had peak winds of 50 km/h (30 mph), as lack of atmospheric instability prevented strengthening. However, the JTWC estimated 1 minute winds of 85 km/h (55 mph). Clarisse dissipated on January 7 about 500 km (310 mi) east of St. Brandon.[14][15]"

        "content": "A low-pressure area developed on January 5 near Christmas Island in the Australian basin. Moving westward due to a large anticyclone to the south, it gradually intensified and was named Chris by the BoM. The storm developed an eye on January 9,[16] and that day crossed 90° E into the south-west Indian Ocean.[17] On January 11, the Mauritius Meteorology Service renamed the storm as Damia.[16] On the next day, the Dvorak rating reached 6.0 for the storm,[5] and the MFR estimated peak 10 minute winds of 215 km/h (135 mph), making it an intense tropical cyclone. The agency also estimated a minimum barometric pressure of 898 mbar (26.52 inHg). Damia turned southwestward and slowly weakened; by January 16, the cyclone weakened to tropical storm status, although it reintensified into a tropical cyclone the next day.[17] Around that time, the storm passed about 20 km (12 mi) north of Rodrigues and later approached Mauritius before curving to the south.[5] As a weakened tropical storm, Damia later curved more to the southeast and dissipated on January 23.[17] On Rodrigues, Damia produced wind gusts of 113 km/h (70 mph) as well as nearly 300 mm (12 in) of rainfall in 24 hours. The storm damaged or destroyed 70 houses, forcing 500 people to shelters, while 100 km (60 mi) of unpaved roads were wrecked. Power, telephone, and water access was disrupted. Damia heavily damaged the island's agriculture, with 25% of the corn crop destroyed. Several fishing boats were wrecked, and 15% of forest areas were damaged. Monetary damage was estimated at $650,000 (USD), which prompted the government to request international aid for rebuilding.[18]"

        "content": "The ITCZ became active toward the end of January from the coast of Madagascar to Diego Garcia, spawning a distinct circulation on January 31 southeast of Tromelin Island,[19] which became a tropical disturbance.[20] Due to a trough, the system moved west-southwestward toward Madagascar. On February 1, the system was named Electre as it gradually intensified. Two days later, the storm moved ashore eastern Madagascar between Toamasina and Mahanoro with peak winds of 80 km/h (50 mph). Electre weakened as it crossed the country and emerged into the Mozambique Channel on February 4 south of Maintirano. The storm re-intensified to its former peak intensity as it turned west-northwest. On February 5, Electre made its final landfall on central Mozambique between Lumbo and Quelimane, dissipating soon thereafter.[19][20] Striking the country just two days after Tropical Storm Frida affected the region, Electre brought additional rainfall,[7] with a peak 24‑hour total of 151.1 mm (5.95 in) at Mahanoro. The storm also produced peak winds of 119 km/h (74 mph) in Mananjary.[19] Electre caused flooding and landslides, particularly in the area around Lake Alaotra. The storm damaged all roads from eastern Madagascar to the capital city Antananarivo, as well as the rail connecting the city with Toamasina. There were 13 deaths in the country.[7]"

On February 1, the storm intensified to peak winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) before turning westward and moving back ashore,[21] steered by a ridge.[5] Frida dissipated later that day,[21] producing wind gusts of 119 km/h (74 mph) in Farafangana.[5] As the storm moved through the former Fianarantsoa Province, it dropped rainfall that flooded and isolated several towns. The floods washed away bridges and knocked down power lines.[7]"

Moving to the southwest, the storm attained peak winds of 80 km/h (50 mph). On February 6, Gabrielle passed northwest of Mauritius and Réunion; on the latter island, the mountainous peak Plaine des Cafres recorded gusts of 158 km/h (98 mph). The storm continued to the southwest without much change in intensity, weakening slightly on February 9. That day, Gabrielle turned to the west-northwest and executed a tight loop before progressing southward. After turning to the southeast, the storm dissipated on February 11.[5][22]"

        "content": "The ITCZ became active in the middle of March northeast of Madagascar, which spawned two low-pressure areas on March 15. The westernmost became a tropical disturbance on the next day between Madagascar and Tromelin. It quickly intensified while tracking to the southwest and was named Justine on March 17. On March 18, the storm intensified into tropical cyclone status and developed a well-defined eye. At 15:00 UTC that day, Justine moved ashore northeastern Madagascar near Sambava. It continued southwestward and weakened over the island, emerging into the Mozambique Channel near Besalampy as a tropical storm. It re-intensified into a tropical cyclone over waters, reaching peak winds of 150 km/h (95 mph) on March 22 only 20 km (12 mi) offshore Mozambique. That day, a ridge over southern Africa steered Justine to the southeast away from land, although the ridge weakened and allowed the storm to move back to the west-southwest. It weakened to a tropical storm during this time. The storm turned again to the southeast on March 24 after the ridge moved to the east. Justine passed north of Europa Island before striking Madagascar again early on March 25 just north of Toliara. It became extratropical over land, and soon again reached open waters while turning to the south. Justine dissipated on March 27 within the flow of the westerlies.[23][24] While entering the Mozambique Channel, Justine was restrengthening and produced peak winds of 180 km/h (110 mph) in Besalampy. The storm also dropped heavy rainfall, with a 24‑hour peak of 404.5 mm (15.93 in) in Sambava where it moved ashore.[23] The storm was the final in a series of storms affecting the country, damaging coastal towns in the northeast and southwest. Justine damaged houses, crops, and roads, while destroying a vanilla storage shed in Sambava.[7] While the storm was changing its trajectory offshore Mozambique, the Commandant Bourdais ship attempted to avoid the storm, only to sail through 102 kilometres per hour (63 mph) gusts and 14 m (46 ft) waves, which flooded the deck and damaged a gangway. Later, Justine passed near Europa island, producing 6 to 9 m (20 to 30 ft) waves.[23]"

It developed a spiral area of convection on April 24,[25] which preceded the development of a tropical disturbance the next day.[26] By that time, the system was already at tropical storm status and was given the name Karla. Moving southwest, the storm strengthened and organized. A ridge to the south steered Karla to the east on April 27, although an approaching trough turned it to the southeast on the following day. Enhanced atmospheric instability helped the storm strengthen to tropical cyclone status on April 29. On the next day, Karla attained peak winds of 170 km/h (105 mph) after developing a well-defined eye.[25][26] Increased wind shear and progressively cooler waters weakened the cyclone as it turned more to the south.[27] By May 3, the storm weakened to tropical depression status and dissipated the next day within the westerlies.[25][26]"

Given the name Heberte, it moved southward initially, reaching winds of only 50 km/h (30 mph).[28] A ridge to the south turned the system back north,[5] and Heberte dissipated on February 14 near where it formed.[28] There were three short-lived tropical depressions toward the end of February. The first formed on February 19 about 350 km (220 mi) northeast of Tromelin Island. It moved southward toward Mauritius, bringing several days of heavy rainfall there and Réunion. The depression turned to the west-northwest and dissipated on February 23.[29] That day, the other two depressions formed, including one between Réunion and Madagascar. Given the name Isabeau, it moved westward and dissipated on February 24, reaching winds of only 50 km/h (30 mph).[29][30] The other depression originated in the Mozambique Channel off the southwest coast of Madagascar. On February 24, the system passed south of the island while moving southeastward, bringing wind gusts of 79 km/h (49 mph) at Tôlanaro. It gradually became extratropical, dissipating within the westerlies on February 26.[29] The JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 20S, estimating 1 minute winds of 85 km/h (55 mph),[31] although it was only officially classified as a tropical depression.[29]"

        "content": " The 2022 eastern Australia floods were one of the nation's worst recorded flood disasters with a series of floods that occurred from late February to early May in South East Queensland, the Wide Bay–Burnett and parts of coastal New South Wales. Brisbane suffered major flooding, along with the cities of Maryborough, Gympie, the Sunshine Coast, Caboolture, Toowoomba, Gatton, Ipswich, Logan City, the Gold Coast, Murwillumbah, Mullumbimby, Grafton, Byron Bay, Ballina, Lismore, the Central Coast and parts of Sydney. Twenty-four people are known to have died during the disaster.[10] Throughout South East Queensland and the Wide Bay–Burnett, almost one thousand schools were closed in response to the flooding,[11] evacuations took place[12] and the public were advised to avoid non-essential travel.[13] Food shortages were reported across the region, due to the ensuing supply chain crisis as well as affecting communities in outback Queensland.[14] The flooding caused the ground across South West Queensland and North Western New South Wales to become saturated and vulnerable to even small amounts of rain.[15]"

        "header": "Cause",
        "content": "The flooding was the result of a low pressure system over Queensland's southern coast that dragged in moisture from the Coral Sea in the north, raising it over the Queensland coastline. The area of colder air higher in the atmosphere which the low-pressure system travelled in, thus making the atmosphere unstable and permitting moisture to be lifted up and falling as rain. As the system headed south, it turned into an East Coast Low near the Central Coast and Sydney. Furthermore, around New Zealand, there existed an area of high pressure, which is an anti-clockwise rotating blocking high that obstructed the low pressure system from drifting away into the Tasman Sea.[19]"

        "content": "The Brisbane central business district (CBD) experienced flooding, as well as the inner city areas of South Bank and South Brisbane, Milton, West End, Windsor, Lutwyche, Gordon Park, Grange, Wooloowin, Toombul and Newstead. On 28 February the Brisbane River's height reached 3.8 metres (12 ft), higher than the 2.3-metre (7 ft 7 in) peak height of flooding in 2013 but below the 3.9 metres recorded during the 2010–2011 Queensland floods[20] and less than the peak height of 4.46m in 2011.[21] \nThe Kedron Brook Floodway broke its weir at multiple points inundating houses in the surrounding suburbs and flooding the Toombul Shopping Centre, which shut permanently as a result of the subsequent flood damage. Substantial infrastructure damage was caused to the Kedron Brook Floodway attributable to the 1,000 mm of rain that fell in its catchment over the 72 hour period of the floods. In Brisbane 177 suburbs were impacted with more than 23,000 homes inundated.[22] Throughout South-East Queensland, more than 20,000 homes were  inundated and power outages affected over 51,000 properties.[23][24]\nAll public transport services were shut down lasting for several days, including rail, buses, and City Cat ferries. South-East Queensland's rail network suffered extensive damage resulting from landslips, and major highways closed due to flooding, including the Bruce Highway, the Warrego Highway and the Ipswich Motorway.[25] Holman Street ferry wharf in the Brisbane River suffered damage by floating debris.[26] On the 28 February, a river crane for the Kangaroo Point Bridge broke free of its mooring, causing the evacuation of apartment and office buildings along Eagle Street and the area of Howard Smith Wharves.[27][28] Wivenhoe Dam peaked at 183.9% capacity that day, despite the outflow gates being opened, albeit not at 100%.[29] Enoggera Dam, in the western Brisbane suburb of The Gap, reached a record capacity of 270% on the same day.[30] Wivenhoe Dam is primarily designed for drinking water supply to Brisbane, Ipswich, and surrounding areas, as well as flood protection for Brisbane. The 2022 floods would have been significantly worse if it were not for Wivenhoe Dam, with the dam also being ~56% full prior to the huge inflow.[31] Over the course of the rain event (excluding subsequent inflows after the rain had stopped), Wivenhoe had inflows of 2.2 million mega litres (ML), and released only 150,000 ML, effectively holding back 2.05 million ML from flowing down the Brisbane River and decimating Greater Brisbane.[32]"

        "content": "In the Wide Bay–Burnett, the city of Gympie suffered its worst flooding since 1893, with the Mary river peaking at 22.96 metres on 28 February.[33]  About 550 people sought shelter at the Gympie evacuation shelter, and up to 3600 homes were inundated in the city.[34] The city of Maryborough also suffered flooding in parts of its CBD and cut bridges, an 11-metre flood levee was erected to protect the rest of the city centre.[35] On 23 February 2022, freight train Y279, operated by Aurizon derailed at approximately 3:30am due to flash flooding that had resulted in a track washout at the 149.020 km point just south of Traveston.[36] On the morning of 28 March, Emergency Services were called to a submerged vehicle in Toowoomba where a man and several dogs had drowned due to the flooding.[37] On 29 March, heavy rainfall caused flood levels to peak at 3.6 metres (12 ft) in Dalby, swamping homes and businesses, with many residents considering to resettle elsewhere after four floods in five months destroyed their homes.[38]"

Four people perished in Lismore, after the area suffered its worst flood in recorded history, inundating many businesses and homes in the city, which peaked 2 metres above the town's last record flood.[40] More than 3,000 homes in Lismore were affected by the flood, leaving the region looking like a 'war zone'. There were around 270 people refuging in Lismore's two evacuation centres, with thousands of others finding shelter in family and friends' places of residence.[41]  Community groups also stepped in to fill gaps in the state and federal governments' response, helping to clear and clean flood damaged houses while providing food and shelter.[42] On 30 March, Byron Bay's main street (Jonson Street) was partially submerged in floodwaters following another wave of sousing rain in northern NSW. A residential estate in Ballina was also submerged, flooding homes.[43] On 30 March, after the all-clear had been given in Lismore less than 24 hours prior, an evacuation order was again issued for those in low-lying areas of the city as the levee overflowed as the Wilsons River began to rise (expected to peak at 12 metres) and the city centre flooded, in addition to a woman going missing in floodwaters south of Lismore.[44] The heavy rainfall and flash flooding evoked more than 60 flood rescues in the 24 hours leading up to the 30th, in addition to some locals being isolated due to surrounding floodwaters. The Pacific Highway was closed in both directions between Wardell and Tintenbar due to the flooding.[45]"

Areas near the Georges River and Manly Dam were placed under an evacuation order by the State Emergency Service as floodwaters began to rise that day, with 2000 people evacuating in Manly.[48] Floodwaters in this event topped 2021's levels, with playgrounds and caravan parks being submerged, particularly in Freshwater, Brookvale, Manly, Curl Curl and the encompassing suburbs.[49][50] In the Upper North Shore, the Roseville Bridge was flooded, in addition to a portion of a ceiling at Bondi Junction Westfield collapsing.[51] On 7 April, the floods forced Picton, New South Wales to be placed under an evacuation warning as the Stonequarry Creek continued to rise. Camden, New South Wales was inundated as the floodwaters rose.[52] On 2 July, Camden, New South Wales was ordered to evacuate for the fourth time of the year due more major flooding.[53]"

        "content": "European Commission's European External Action Service activated the Copernicus Emergency Management Service – Mapping in order to produce delineation maps[54] of floods in the Brisbane, Gatton, Grafton, Grantham, Gympie, Lismore, Maryborough and Wivenhoe areas of interest. On March 7, Scott Morrison stated \"these are floods that we have not seen in living memory in anyone's lifetime, and even before that.\"[55] New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet vowed to fund the flood recovery, saying that he was \"not going to spare a dollar\" in flood recovery efforts. He also stated that there should be direct housing for residents who lost homes, which was a particular concern. According to emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, of the approximately 1,400 rapid property damage assessments taken in Lismore, 900 of them were already considered uninhabitable.[56] One of the many criticisms by the affected residents was the slow pace of troops arriving to the region. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese criticised the government's handling of bringing in the Australian Defence Force (ADF), saying, \"Clearly, there have been issues here with people who were on the roofs of places for a long period of time. There's a need for an explanation\". Although Defence minister Peter Dutton and Dominic Perrottet defended the timing of the ADF's arrival, contending that many parts of the area were inaccessible due to inundating floodwaters.[57] Scott Morrison, in particular, was subject to widespread criticism over his delayed response to the floods.[58] On 9 March, around 100 infuriated locals in Lismore protested to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, but were denied meeting him face to face. They carried signs and chanted, \"the water is rising, no more compromising\" and \"we need help\".[59] It was left to Koori Mail staff and volunteers to coordinate efforts to supply food and essential supplies to the local Aboriginal community and others in Lismore, with financial support only following months later.[60] On 9 March, Architects Assist, an initiative of the Australian Institute of Architects, extended the offer of pro bono consultations and architectural services to the flood victims.[61]"

        "content": "Damage from floods was expected to reach almost A$1.5 billion, as additional ADF troops came to aid in clean-up efforts. Insurance Council of Australia figures calculated the cost of claims from the disaster was A$1.45 billion as of 7 March, but it was expected to rise once the extent of the damage is known. According to the council, insurers had received more than 96,000 claims, with 80 per cent of those for homes, thus far. Of those, 69% of claims had come from Queensland, with 31% from NSW. There had been as many as 5,000 ADF personnel distributed across the flood disaster areas by 5 March. Despite the aid efforts, there was rising criticism from those impacted by the floods that the government was too slow to act in sending in defence troops to help them. As of 8 March, more than $282 million in disaster payments to flood victims were paid to 242,000 people ($157 million to victims in NSW and $125 million to those in Queensland). The LGAs affected would gain from the next stage of support for the victims, which included $256 million for emergency relief, food relief and financial counselling services.[62]"

The event featured popular Australian musicians who performed to raise money, such as, Tones and I, Jimmy Barnes, Delta Goodrem, Jon Stevens, Vanessa Amorosi, Hunters and Collectors, The Living End, Casey Donovan and Sheppard. The hosts included Seven's Natalie Barr, David Koch, Sonia Kruger and Mark Ferguson; Nine's Scott Cam, Sylvia Jeffreys, Andy Lee and Peter Overton; and 10's Carrie Bickmore, Dr. Chris Brown, Amanda Keller and Osher Günsberg. Proceeds from the telethon were donated to the Australian Red Cross, which provided support to those ravaged by the floods, and this will include evacuation support, staffing of relief centres and outreach services, in addition to helping people and communities recuperate and rebuild.[63]"

It soon moved over land, re-emerging off the Northern Territory coast on 3 December. Late on 4 December, the low reached tropical cyclone status, receiving the name Amelia as it moved west-southwest through the Timor Sea. Soon afterwards, however, the system fell below cyclone intensity. It drifted west-southwest over the next few days, dissipating on 6 December.[1]"

It moved westward and intensified, becoming a cyclone later that day, although it did not receive a name. At 1400 UTC on 20 December, it made landfall near Gove at its peak intensity with winds of 85 km/h (55 mph) and a minimum pressure of 990 hPa. The strongest winds were likely in the southern quadrants due to its rapid westward movement. The cyclone weakened as it moved over land, but emerged offshore near Darwin on the 21st. Now over water, it once again intensified to tropical cyclone intensity, reaching a secondary peak intensity with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) and a pressure of 992 hPa. The system dissipated on 23 December. At Gove, sustained winds of 115 km/h and gusts of over 148 km/h were recorded, the highest from the system. Extensive tree damage occurred in the Gove area, and some minor damage to ships occurred at the Nabalco Wharf.[2]"

The system reached cycle intensity at 00:00 UTC on 7 January, receiving the name Chris. Over the next few days, Chris moved generally westwards as it steadily deepened, steered by a strong anticyclone located south of the storm. On 9 January, Chris passed 90°E and moved into the Météo-France area of responsibility, where it was renamed Damia.[3] The system would later become the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the South-West Indian Ocean at the time, with an estimated pressure of 898 hPa (mbar).[4]"

        "header": "Tropical Cyclone Bruno",
        "content": "On 10 January, a weak tropical low formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria from a monsoon trough. The low drifted slowly westwards, crossing the coast near Maningrida late on the 14th. Despite moving over land, the system continued to organise and reached cyclone intensity at 18:00 UTC on 15 January, while the centre was located near Wadeye. The storm, now named Bruno, continued to develop over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf and reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 90 km/h (55 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 989 hPa (mbar) late on the 15th. Bruno made another landfall again at about 07:00 UTC on 16 January, turning towards the southwest and steadily weakening, although it continued to produce gale-force winds as it moved through the West Kimberley. After Bruno passed Port Hedland, the system moved out to sea and rapidly reintensified. Bruno reached its ultimate peak intensity at 15:00 UTC on 19 January, with winds of 90 km/h (55 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 980 hPa (mbar). The storm once again made landfall in the Exmouth Gulf later that day. A weakened Bruno moved out to sea again the next day but the system made its final landfall south of Perth on January 22 and dissipated soon after. Bruno caused torrential rainfall to many areas of Western Australia, especially in the southwest where some stations set records for January rainfall. Severe flooding occurred in the southwest, with the Blackwood River reaching its highest level in over 25 years. Many bridges were washed away and there was extensive road and rail damage. A number of towns were flooded, with 75 houses being flooded in Nannup. Total damage was estimated at $10 million (1982 AUD, $10.9 million 1982 USD).[5]"

The system was first identified on 11 January. It drifted southeast and became a tropical cyclone at 09:00 UTC the next day. Daphne-Fifi slowly intensified as it moved towards the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Curving towards the east, Daphne-Fifi reached its peak intensity early on 16 January with peak winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 986 hPa (mbar). On the 19th, the system accelerated towards the southeast and weakened, dissipating a few days later as it crossed the Western Australian coast.

Errol slowly intensified over the coming days, reaching its peak intensity on 15 January with winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 980 hPa (mbar) as it recurved towards the southeast. After peaking, the storm weakened and Errol merged with Cyclone Bruno on the 18 January.[7] The storm caused flood damage in Western Australia.[8]"

For the next 3 days, the low moved northeast, and then northwest, slowly intensifying. On 25 January, the low turned towards the southeast, becoming a cyclone the following night. During the next 3 days, Abigail executed a cyclonic loop, and it made another major turn towards the east-northeast on the 30th. Abigail reached its highest intensity in the Australian region on 1 February with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and an estimated central pressure of 975 hPa (mbar), moving out of the basin immediately after. Abigail caused no damage or fatalities in the Australian region.[9]"

Moving eastward, it reached cyclone status before it made landfall in the Kimberley Region the next day. Weakening to a tropical low, it recurved to the west on the 29th, steered by a developing ridge of high pressure. Early on January 31, the low moved out to sea and quickly redeveloped before once again turning to the southwest and nearing the coast. Just before it made its second landfall near Port Hedland, Graham peaked with winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 980 hPa (mbar). During the January 28–30 period, Graham caused extensive landfall over the Kimberley, with 178 mm recorded in Broome during a 24-hour period ending at 01:00 UTC on the 30th. After its second landfall, building and tree damage was reported at Pardoo Station."

        "content": " The Black Hills Flood of 1972, also known as the Rapid City Flood, was the most detrimental flood in South Dakota history, and one of the deadliest floods in U.S. history. The flood took place on June 9–10, 1972[1] in the Black Hills of Western South Dakota. 15 inches (380 mm) of rain in a small area over the Black Hills caused Rapid Creek and other waterways to overflow. Severe flooding of residential and commercial properties in Rapid City occurred when Canyon Lake Dam became clogged with debris and failed in the late evening hours of June 9 resulting in 238 deaths and 3,057 injuries.[2] Over 1,335 homes and 5,000 automobiles were destroyed. The value of property damage was estimated to be over US$160 million in 1972 dollars ($1.2 billion in 2024 dollars[3]). Flooding also occurred in Battle, Spring, Bear Butte, and Boxelder creeks.[4]"
      },
      {
        "header": "Causes",
        "content": "A few days before the Rapid City Flood, \"earlier rains had left the soil saturated, increasing the amount of runoff of the flood to come.\"[4] On the afternoon of June 9, substantial rains fell on the area, caused by \"an almost stationary group of thunderstorms.\"[4] Additionally, \"a strong low-level easterly flow which forced the moist unstable air up-slope on the hills. This sustained orographic effect helped the air to rise, cool, and release its moisture in repeating thunderstorms. Another contributing factor was the unusually light winds at a higher atmospheric levels which did not disperse the moist air nor move the thunderstorms along to prevent an extreme concentration of rainfall.\"[4] According to Herbert Thompson the air pattern causing this storm was noticed in big measure over the Great Plains, with a minor scale to the east of the Rockies. There were only what appeared to be light winds, so nothing indicated that there was a huge storm underway. Thompson further indicates that a cold high pressure region was pushed from Canada into the Great Lakes region leading into the western part of South Dakota. A \"mesoscale cloud mass\" from Colorado also moved towards Rapid City.[5] One of the cloud masses amplified the \"mid-level moisture over Rapid City,\" while the other mass caused the pressure to stay, as the high pressure pushed downward, thus creating the right conditions to produce rainfall.[6] The rainfall from the upper \"cloud mass\" above the Black Hills formed into new smaller masses downwind which reprocessed the rain allowing for the constant rainfall.[7] The storm was described by Nair, Hjelmfelt, and Pielke as \"convective cells of high precipitation efficiency a characteristic of tropical precipitation systems.[1] Cloud seeding experiments being conducted by the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences on clouds west of Rapid City were speculated to have contributed to the unusual amount of rain. However, there is no evidence that the two phenomena were related.[8] The immense precipitation was based over the \"Rapid, Boxelder, Spring, and Battle Creeks,\" creating run-off, along these creeks which led to flooding throughout the surrounding areas.[1] The intense rain began on the afternoon of June 9 and continued until after midnight on June 10. The immense amount of rain the Black Hills received during the thunderstorms ranged from 4 to 15 inches, causing Rapid Creek and surrounding creeks to overflow and creating massive amounts of runoff that resulted in flood waters. The run-off carried rubble to the Canyon Lake Dam creating a barrier in front of its spillway.[4] This resulted in the \"increase in depth of water behind the dam of 11 to 12 feet,\" which caused the release of more water adding to the already moving floodwaters.[9] The flash flood hit Rapid City the hardest around midnight on June 9; the flood waters also hit the small town of Keystone nearby.[4]"

        "header": "Damage",
        "content": "The flood caused a tremendous amount of damage. Flood waters displaced large rocks, trees, trailers, and vehicles, and carried homes away.[10] In Rapid City the flood resulted in the deaths of \"238 including 5 missing,\" 14 of the deaths were trained professionals.[11] The flood resulted in over 3,000 people being injured. A total of 1,335 homes were ruined, and 2,820 homes were damaged. More than 200 businesses were ruined, and around 5,000 cars were demolished. The damage in Rapid City totaled $66 million in 1972 dollar value.[11] As for Keystone, \"eight people were killed and much of the town was washed away.\"[4] The damage in Keystone totaled around $1.5 million.[11] The total cost of the 1972 Black Hills flood totaled $165 million, including infrastructure and utilities. The total amount of rain the Black Hills received was \"800,000 acre feet\" equal to \"1 billion metric tons of water.\"[11] The National Weather Service Office (NWS) in Rapid City in 1972 was taking hourly surface observations, issuing local storm warnings and providing local forecasts to the media. The personnel in Rapid City were not properly trained to make forecasts or use the technologies available to them.[12] They lacked access to vital weather information to warn the area citizens."

      {
        "header": "Then and now",
        "content": "The Rapid City National Weather Service is now a forecast office with a full-time staff of meteorologists who issue both forecasts and warnings for northeastern Wyoming and the western third of South Dakota.  In 1972, the National Weather Service office in Rapid City did not have a teletype system to broadcast warnings.  They instead used a one-way telephone hotline to the media to broadcast the warnings.  Today warnings are sent to a regional site where they are sent to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Wire System satellite.  NWS forecasters use the state radio system to notify 9-1-1 dispatchers and emergency personnel.  This warning is also passed on to the Emergency Alert System (EAS). In the aftermath of the 1972 flood, short-term and long-term programs were put into effect.  Many businesses were permitted to stay in the flood plain, but houses and motels were either raised or moved due to the likelihood that a flood would occur while a person may be sleeping.  The majority of the flood plain was made into large parks, which have increased in number and have been improved and updated on a continuing basis. Canyon Lake Dam and most bridges were redesigned to prevent debris clogs during flooding."

        "content": "Victims lost precious memories as stated in the Rapid City newspaper.  An excerpt from the newspaper reads, \"Operation Family Treasure' may provide hope for people.'  For those who have given up all hope about finding a priceless photo album or sheet of important personal papers there may be a happy ending with \"Operation Family Treasure,\" a clearing house for irreplaceable items run by the Rapid City Jaycees in conjunction with the Office of Civil defense.  Flood disaster victims advised on tax breaks.\"[13] Eldon L. Smith, a South Dakota state senator, was a victim of the flood.[14] 2012 saw the 40 year anniversary of the fateful flood.  Survivors remarked on the horrific events. Rita, who was 20 at the time, described the scene, \"There was so many [people] in trees and screaming and crying and the sparks were flying from electric wires, houses were on fire, it was just — it was hell,\" she says.  Rita was seven months pregnant at the time of the tragedy.  She describes her fears as, \"I wouldn't wish that upon nobody,\" she says. \"That's a nightmare and a half to think that you're going to die in water and your mom is gonna go with you and you're trying to do your best to keep your mom alive.\"  Rita and her mother were swept against a building and thankfully rescued.  There were others with the same experience while others were worse.  Good Samaritans like Alex were left to clean up the mess and search for the less fortunate.  He describes a gruesome scene, \"I found a boy about 5 years old,\" Alex says. \"He was dead, laying on some debris. I didn't touch him or nothing, I just went back and told the authorities where he was at. Then I quit.\"[15]"

I guess we gotta couple troubles.\"[16] Another survivor said:\n\"My house is no more. You can see it over there, there's the, well, there just isn't anything.\"[16] And another unidentified survivor added:\n\"A man knocked at our door and said, 'Get out as fast as you can.' We grabbed the children and my dad's crippled and we picked him up and put him in the car, and just as we drove out the driveway, a big trailer started floating right across the pathway, and we just made it up the hill and that was all it was. Everything was gone.\"[16] One source, Sean Potter, Certified Consulting Meteorologist and Certified Broadcast Meteorologist, wrote, \"I called my best advisor, Mr. Leonard Swanson, the City Public Works Director, and we met at City Hall. Heavy rains were falling, and Mr. Swanson and I drove to Canyon Lake Park where a city worker and his family lived in the park caretaker's home, immediately below the dam. Swanny ordered the caretaker, a Parks Department employee, to immediately take his family, leave their evening meal on the table and get out of the park. The entire family survived the flood. Not a trace of the home (it was city property) or the contents was ever found.[17]"

        "content": " The 1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane (Air Weather Service designation: George[2][nb 1]) was a long-lived and an intense tropical cyclone that affected the Bahamas, southernmost Florida, and the Gulf Coast of the United States in September 1947. The fourth Atlantic tropical cyclone of the year, it formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on September 4, becoming a hurricane, the third of the 1947 Atlantic hurricane season, less than a day later. After moving south by west for the next four days, it turned to the northwest and rapidly attained strength beginning on September 9. It reached a peak intensity of 145 mph (233 km/h) on September 15 while approaching the Bahamas. In spite of contemporaneous forecasts that predicted a strike farther north, the storm then turned to the west and poised to strike South Florida, crossing first the northern Bahamas at peak intensity. In the Bahamas, the storm produced a large storm surge and heavy damage, but with no reported fatalities. A day later, the storm struck South Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, its eye becoming the first and only of a major hurricane to strike Fort Lauderdale. In Florida, advance warnings and stringent building codes were credited with minimizing structural damage and reducing loss of life to 17 people, but nevertheless widespread flooding and coastal damage resulted from heavy rainfall and high tides. Many vegetable plantings, citrus groves, and cattle were submerged or drowned as the storm exacerbated already high water levels and briefly threatened to breach the dikes surrounding Lake Okeechobee. However, the dikes held firm, and evacuations were otherwise credited with minimizing the potential death toll. On the west coast of the state, the storm caused further flooding, extensive damage south of the Tampa Bay Area, and the loss of a ship at sea. On September 18, the hurricane entered the Gulf of Mexico and threatened the Florida Panhandle, but later its track moved farther west than expected, ultimately leading to a landfall southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana. Upon making landfall, the storm killed 34 people on the Gulf Coast of the United States and produced a storm tide as high as 15.2 ft (4.6 m), flooding millions of square miles and destroying thousands of homes. The storm was the first major hurricane to test Greater New Orleans since 1915, and the widespread flooding that resulted spurred flood-protection legislation and an enlarged levee system to safeguard the flood-prone area. In all, the powerful storm killed 51 people and caused $110 million (1947 US$) in damage.[nb 2]"

        "content": "On September 2, 1947, an observer for Pan American Airways at Dakar, French West Africa, noted a tropical wave. Within a few days it moved offshore, dropping 85.4 mm (3.36 in) of rain there. The wave was also discernible as a trough aloft, in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and was seen near Cape Verde on September 5. At 12:00 UTC on September 4, the Atlantic hurricane database—HURDAT—initiated a tropical depression midway between Cap-Vert and the archipelago. Before 2014, HURDAT began it as a tropical storm and made it a hurricane within 18 hours of formation, raising its winds from 50 mph (85 km/h) to 75 mph (120 km/h); however, reanalysis found that it took more than a week to become a hurricane. For nearly six days the cyclone—at a brisk 17 mph (27 km/h)—headed south of due west, crossing half the tropical Atlantic, during which observers lost track of it after the second day, due to sparse in-situ data. Late on September 10, the ship Arakaka radioed the next definite report of its position, near 15°N 49°W﻿ / ﻿15°N 49°W﻿ / 15; -49. At 15:00 UTC the next day, reconnaissance was first sent to sample the storm, finding it of moderate intensity. At this point the cyclone began turning north of due west. Within a day it underwent rapid intensification, its winds increasing from 60 mph (95 km/h) to 100 mph (155 km/h), and a new flight reported a pressure of 977 mb (28.9 inHg), indicating a 24-hour drop of 22 mb (0.65 inHg).[nb 3] Now equal to a Category 2 storm, the cyclone trekked west-northwest, a heading it kept for more than three days while being closely surveilled by aircraft. Just after, it attained winds of 115 mph (160 km/h)—major hurricane status—and for the first time aircraft noted concentric eyewalls in an Atlantic hurricane. The storm became a Category 4 hurricane on September 14. Late that day a flight found a pressure of 938 mb (27.7 inHg) in the storm's eye, a record low for a mission to date in the Atlantic, implying maximum sustained winds of 141 mph (227 km/h). Due to a 7-mile-wide (11 km) eye—smaller than average for its location—reanalysis assigned winds of 145 mph (230 km/h), equal to high-end Category 4 status. Within a day the storm weakened and slowed considerably, nearing a \"standstill\" late on September 15 off the northernmost Bahamas, possibly due to a strong ridge.[9][5] Quasi-stationary, the storm lumbered west early on September 16, while sited 250 miles (405 km) east of Palm Beach, Florida. Its trajectory then shifted south of due west, nearing the Abaco Islands. At 19:00 UTC the cyclone made its first landfall, on Great Guana Cay, with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). A weather station on a hilltop to its south—at Hope Town, Elbow Cay—recorded 160 mph (260 km/h), its highest winds on record, feeling the storm's radius of maximum wind. Shortly afterward it logged 60 mph (97 km/h) near the edge of the eye, along with a pressure of 960 mb (28 inHg) at the same time, suggesting a central pressure of 954 mb (28.2 inHg).[nb 4] Both the pressure and the station's elevation justified Category 3 winds, a demotion from the storm's former Category 5 rank in HURDAT. Early on September 16 the storm, now very large—and accordingly described as a \"monster\" by media—turned west-southwest, brushed Grand Bahama, and began to regain force, closing in on peninsular Florida. By the time it reached the state's east coast, its twin eyewalls had formed a large eye, confirming its completion of an inner-core replacement.[11] At 16:30 UTC on September 17, the cyclone struck South Florida near Fort Lauderdale with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h), equal to low-end Category 4 status.[nb 5][13][14] At Hillsboro Inlet Light an anemometer, 43 m (141 ft) above sea level, measured a gust of 155 mph (249 km/h)—the strongest to be verified in a Florida hurricane before Andrew in 1992—and a brief lull, the latter during the eye passage; the former hinted at sustained winds of 131–138 mph (211–228 km/h) near standard height.[nb 6] A barometer there sampled a low of 27.97 inHg (947 mb), and another at Cap's Place noted 945 mb (27.9 inHg), while readings farther south, nearer the center of the eye, varied from 951 to 956 mb (28.1 to 28.2 inHg); as Fort Lauderdale saw a longer calm than Hillsboro, the lowest pressures—reckoned to be near 943 mb (27.8 inHg)[nb 7]—occurred by the eye's edge, implying eyewall mesovortices.[17] The storm's radius of maximum wind was 15 miles (30 km)—near the mean for its intensity and location—but its size was huge and movement slow: hurricane-force winds extended outward 120 miles (195 km) and the storm crept inland at less than 10 mph (15 km/h). Winds over 100 mph (160 km/h) swept more than 70 miles (110 km) of coast between a point \"well north\" of Palm Beach and northern Miami. The storm's top winds were between Lake Worth and Fort Lauderdale, lashing lesser-populated areas such as Pompano, Deerfield, Boca Raton, Delray Beach, Coconut Creek, Coral Springs, and Margate. Winds topped 50 mph (80 km/h) over most of Florida below Brevard County, a radius of 150 miles (240 km). Meteorologist Grady Norton dubbed the storm a \"Great Hurricane\", one of only 10 such Florida storms on record (from 1880–1948), signifying overall intensity and impact; 13 years later his understudy Gordon Dunn deemed it \"Extreme\".[nb 8][21] Upon landfall, the sprawling storm headed west over the marshy Everglades and the Big Cypress region; while slowly weakening, it lightly damaged rural Collier and Broward counties. Just north of Naples, which received the southern side of the eye, the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico around 03:00 UTC on September 18, bearing winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). Moving offshore, it skirted Sanibel and Captiva islands, the latter of which recorded a pressure of 969.5 mb (28.63 inHg).[22][5] Once over water, the hurricane turned more northwesterly and began to restrengthen, its forward pace rising to 18 mph (29 km/h).[23] Around 14:00 UTC on September 19, the hurricane traversed the Chandeleur Islands and hit St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, as a high-end Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h).[nb 9] Its 25-mile-wide (40 km) eye passed over Saint Bernard, Belle Chasse, and downtown New Orleans; several barometers read 967 to 974 mb (28.6 to 28.8 inHg), supporting a central value of 966 mb (28.5 inHg), as Belle Chasse Naval Air Station and the U.S. Weather Bureau office in New Orleans intercepted the calm center.[7][13] After passing inland, the vortex hit the Louisiana state capital Baton Rouge with sustained winds of 96 mph (154 km/h),[23] but degenerated rapidly thereafter: within 10 hours of landfall it lost hurricane status. Over Ark-La-Tex the tropical storm weakened further, becoming a tropical depression in North Texas late on September 20. Past the Red River its track bent northeast, and by 12:00 UTC the next day the system became extratropical, at which time it also dissipated.[5]"

        "content": "On the evening of September 15, the U.S. Weather Bureau foresaw a north turn, suggestive of landfall between\nJacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia. As a precautionary measure, small watercraft between Jupiter, Florida, and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, were advised to remain in port.[26] Early on September 16, the forecast was revised, and hurricane warnings were issued for eastern Florida from Titusville to Fort Lauderdale,[10] later to be expanded to Miami.[27] These were eventually issued for the west coast of the state south of Tampa, along with storm warnings in the Florida Keys.[28] At least 5,000 people sheltered in a courthouse at Miami.[29] As the hurricane approached Northern commercial flights were grounded, and 1,500 National Guard troops were readied to be mobilized if needed by Florida Governor Millard Caldwell.[27] 4,700 persons in Broward County moved into Red Cross shelters,[30] while up to 15,000 people evacuated the flood-prone Lake Okeechobee region.[31] In all, more than 40,000 people statewide moved into Red Cross shelters.[32] Military aircraft were flown to safer locations, in some cases four or days more in advance.[33] Hotels in the at-risk area filled quickly due to fears of a disaster like the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane;[31] at Melbourne and Cocoa no vacant hotels were left for evacuees.[26] During the storm, the MacArthur, North Bay (now Kennedy), and Venetian Causeways in Miami were closed to traffic.[34] At Lake Worth alone, 1,800 people sheltered in nine official shelters during the storm.[35] As the hurricane reached the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters thought it would hit between Apalachicola and Pensacola, Florida, but by 04:15 UTC on September 19, the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans posted hurricane warnings from St. Marks, Florida, to Morgan City, Louisiana.[36] As the storm neared Louisiana, Emile Verret, the acting governor of Baton Rouge, closed the state capital and sent public officials home. In New Orleans, local National Guard units were mobilized.[37]"

        "content": "As the storm passed nearby, Green Turtle Cay was flooded by 2 ft (0.61 m) of water and the local weather station abandoned.[28][42] Heavy seas flooded Hope Town during the storm.[29] On the Abaco Islands the storm destroyed all crops, leading to food shortages.[43] On Abaco Island winds hurled most of the coconuts off the palms, and seawater washed over vegetation, causing the latter to wither. No casualties occurred on the island,[44] though settlements noted substantial damage.[29] Strong winds badly damaged or destroyed the majority of docks and homes on the western end of Grand Bahama.[45] At West End, then Settlement Point, a storm surge of 12 ft (3.7 m) destroyed half the community. Out of roughly 300 families there, the storm left 111 homeless. It leveled or overturned 56 homes and badly damaged 55 more. A weather station during the storm measured winds of 125 mph (201 km/h) at 07:00 UTC on September 17. Fierce winds downed a 40-foot-tall (12 m) tower and extensively damaged the island's primary fishing cannery, the Grand Bahama Packing Company; at the latter they unroofed the main building and collapsed a warehouse.[46][nb 10] Damages were severer on Grand Bahama than on either Bimini or the Abaco Islands.[47] On September 19 the United States Coast Guard dispatched the cutter Macoma to supply Grand Bahama with food and medical necessities. Aircraft also dropped food onto the island.[48] Despite its intensity, the storm was not blamed for any deaths in the Lucayan Archipelago,[23] and only slight injuries were reported.[46]"

        "content": "Statewide the storm destroyed 205 homes and severely damaged 10,543.[49][50] Broadly comparable to the great 1926 and 1928 hurricanes,[51] it killed far fewer people—only 17—than its size and intensity suggested,[52] largely due to improvements in warnings, preparations, and building codes since the 1920s.[53][30] As a result, its winds lightly damaged structures, destroying just 37 homes, mainly small, in Broward County, blowing hundreds more off their foundations, and unroofing lightweight structures in the Palm Beaches, while doing less damage to new buildings. Rainfall and surf did most damage.[54][55][30] Gusts of 127 to 150 mph (204 to 241 km/h) in the Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood area tore off roofs and broke utility poles \"like toothpicks\".[56][57] At Hillsboro Beach homes suffered roof and window damage but survived.[54] At West Palm Beach, 40% of the initial $11⁄2 million in losses were to roofs. Gusts there reached 140 mph (230 km/h),[55][58] snapping many trees.[59] The storm ravaged the Boca Raton Army Air Field, doing $41⁄2 million in losses there and hastening its closure; on base the hurricane mostly destroyed makeshift structures, including 150 barracks, supply houses, warehouses, the post stockade, the fire station, and the theater and mess buildings.[60] At Hialeah, the 11,000-seat race track was mostly unroofed, its barns and paddocks damaged and many of its flamingos missing.[61] Gusts of 110 mph (180 km/h) flipped and wrecked aircraft at Miami International Airport, while destroying hangars. Across Miami the winds felled power lines, signage, awnings, and trees.[62] A large storm tide inundated the beaches, peaking at 11 ft (3.4 m) at Hillsboro Inlet; similar levels occurred elsewhere from Fort Lauderdale to Palm Beach, eroding long swaths of State Highway A1A. Washouts also occurred from Sunny Isles Beach to Baker's Haulover Inlet.[56][63][64] Near Lake Worth the ocean eliminated a 5-mile-long (8.0 km) segment of roadway,[65] and washed out a 1-mile (1.6 km) section at Delray Beach.[66] High tides reconfigured the coast, opening new channels and old inlets,[67] and \"whitecaps broke\" 1 mi (1.6 km) inland on Las Olas Boulevard. The waves unmoored a few freighters at Port Everglades.[30] A 6+1⁄2-foot-high (2.0 m) storm tide hit Bahia Mar Yacht Club, near the port.[68] Large waves battered apartments, homes, and many of the 334 resorts on Miami Beach,[61] causing severe flooding.[62] A 3-to-4-foot-deep (0.91 to 1.22 m) layer of sand covered many grounds, and nearby neighborhoods on the Venetian Islands, like Belle Isle, were flooded to a depth of several feet.[34] At Pompano floods lingered five days after the storm, covering the municipal beach and isolating the Hillsboro Inlet bridge.[54][69] The sea also left sand drifts at Dania Beach,[70] and swept away six homes at Deerfield.[54] Tides reached 5.8 ft (1.8 m) at Fort Pierce.[71] As it crossed South Florida, the storm dropped prolific rains over a broad area,[72] peaking at 10.12 in (257 mm) at St. Lucie Lock,[62][73] and so worsened a rainier-than-average wet season.[nb 11][75][30] In Miami, floods swamped 200 mi (320 km) of city streets, and in Miami Springs over half the homes. Homestead \"resembled Venice\".[62] Davie, having lost 35,000 citrus trees to floodwaters in past months, incurred devastating losses to groves and vegetable beds. In Fort Lauderdale the New River overran its banks, submerging downtown streets.[54][76] The storm ruined vegetable beds in Broward County,[77] delaying cultivation.[54] It yielded 6 to 8 in (150 to 200 mm) of rain over the Everglades, flooding farms and drowning cattle.[72][78] On Lake Okeechobee, the cyclone rivaled the 1928 hurricane,[79] imperiling—but not overtopping—the Herbert Hoover Dike.[80][72] Tides reached 21.6 ft (6.6 m) at Clewiston and 20.9 ft (6.4 m) at Moore Haven. Near the north shore, tides crested at 13 ft (4.0 m).[79][80] A 150-foot-long (46 m) section of dike collapsed, stranding 700 cattle and flooding 1,800 acres (730 ha) of cropland. On Conners Highway floodwaters and debris combined to obstruct motorists; the former seeped over at 30 spots and overwhelmed a 3,000-foot-long (910 m) stretch.[81][82] On the state's west coast, sustained winds of 105 mph (169 km/h) buffeted Naples, which likely missed the worst conditions.[7]  \"Heavy\" impacts affected the Fort Myers–Punta Gorda area, and 3 ft (0.91 m) of water covered the Sanibel Island Light grounds.[72] Tides at Everglades City peaked at 5+1⁄2 ft (1.7 m), forcing denizens into attics and flooding local streets.[62] However, winds blew offshore over Tampa Bay, resulting in below-normal tides and lesser damages.[23] In Pinellas County winds damaged boats and ripped off roof shingles. In St. Petersburg the storm and a walk-out strike coincided, disrupting trolley service for 15 hours.[83] In Fort Myers, hundreds of trees were prostrated and the city left powerless.[78] During the storm, two vessels, with a total combined crew of nine people, went missing; as of September 18, contact had been established with the former and the crew declared safe, but the remaining vessel, with a crew of two, had not been accounted for.[84] Additionally, six Cuban schooners carrying 150 crew members in all sheltered off Anclote Key late on September 17 and rode out the storm.[84] However, another Cuban vessel, the Antonio Cerdedo, foundered and sank off Fort Myers with a loss of seven of its crew members.[50] On September 19, a tornado generated by the storm struck Apalachicola, cutting a 3-mile (4.8 km) path, killing two people, and injuring 100 others. The tornado damaged or destroyed 58 homes over a 100-yard-wide (91 m) area, inflicting F3-level damage on the present Fujita scale.[85]"

        "content": "Wind instruments at Moisant Field were disabled after recording sustained winds of 90 mph (140 km/h). Due to northerly winds, water overtopped sections of the levees on Lake Pontchartrain, leaving some lakefront streets \"waist deep,\" above the 3-foot (0.91 m) delimiter. Local communications failed during the storm, so the New Orleans Weather Bureau office handed responsibility to its counterpart in Fort Worth, Texas, which issued public advisories instead.[37] The storm flooded a large part of Greater New Orleans: up to 2 ft (0.61 m) of water covered Moisant Field, forcing it to shut down, and up to 6 ft (1.8 m) in parts of Jefferson Parish.[86] The storm surge in Louisiana peaked at 9.8–11.2 ft (3.0–3.4 m) at Shell Beach on Lake Borgne and at 11.5 ft (3.5 m) in Ostrica.[nb 12][86][88] In Orleans Parish the surge overtopped the 9-foot-tall (2.7 m) seawall—built by the Orleans Levee Board in the 1920s to stop a repeat of the 1915 hurricane there—and spread water over 9 sq mi (23 km2) of the parish, as far from Lake Pontchartrain as Gentilly Ridge. Water covered large parts of Jefferson Parish for as long as two weeks. Subsidence settled behind the levees, forming \"topographic bowls\". These contained up to 6 ft (1.8 m) of water, which was dredged and pumped back into Lake Pontchartrain. An 11-foot (3.4 m) storm surge also hit remote areas of St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes.[89] Tides of up to 15.2 ft (4.6 m) impacted the western half of the Mississippi coast,[23] causing heavy damage in Bay St. Louis, Gulfport, and Biloxi. These recorded their highest tides on record until Hurricane Camille.[90] Although the storm was not a major hurricane at landfall, it still did significant damage, in part owing to the hydrology of the region. 12 people were killed in Louisiana and 22 in Mississippi.[52] In both states combined, the Red Cross reported that the storm destroyed 1,647 homes and damaged 25,000 others, mostly by water.[23] In New Orleans, the storm produced an estimated $100 million worth of damage to the city.[86]"

Truman.[53] The hurricane, a subsequent tropical storm, and an October hurricane generated one of the worst floods in South Florida's history, spurring the creation of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District, along with a plan for new flood-control levees and canals.[91][92][30] In New Orleans, the United States Congress approved the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Project to assist ongoing efforts to increase the height of the existing levee along the lakeshore; to bolster the existing seawall in Orleans Parish, an 8-foot-high (2.4 m) levee was erected along the lakeside in Jefferson Parish.[93] New Orleans' Walnut Street Ferry was damaged and never replaced. If this same storm were to hit in 2006 it would probably do around $14.406 billion (2006 USD) in damages.[94]"

      "^Tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin werenot formally namedprior toWorld War II. Storms such as this one were denoted by their attributes, including coincidence withCatholic saints' feasts. Starting in 1947 theUnited States Weather Bureauoffice inMiami, working with themilitary, informally applied theJoint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabetto Atlantic tropical cyclones; the first storm to be soidentifiedin public advisories wasHurricane Foxin1950,[3][4]when the names also first appear in Atlantic HURDAT.[5]The 1947 storm has also been colloquially called thePompano Beach(or simplyPompano),Broward, orSoutheast Floridastorm, as well as theNew Orleans hurricane.[6]",
      "^All damage totals are in 1947 United States dollars unless otherwise noted.",
      "^The same flight estimated winds of 144 mph (232 km/h).[7]Note, however, that reconnaissance-derived estimates of wind speed are considered unreliable prior to the mid-1970s, if not more than a decade later.[8]",
      "^According to one report, however, the pressure coincided with the station's strongest winds.[10]",
      "^Original HURDAT showed landfall farther north, nearBoca Raton, with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), the latter derivative of the Hillsboro observation, which was erroneously taken to be a sustained wind.[12]",
      "^The Saffir–Simpson scale uses an elevation of 10 m (33 ft) above mean sea level.[15]",
      "^Before 2014 the lowest central value in Florida was officially listed as 940 mb (28 inHg).[16]",
      "^A \"Great Hurricane\" contained winds over 125 mph (200 km/h) and spread hurricane-force winds over 100 miles (160 km) or more, while also generating high tides, low pressures, extensive damage, and casualties.[18]An \"Extreme\" hurricane featured winds of at least 136 mph (219 km/h)—roughly equivalent to Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson scale—and a barometric pressure of no more than 28.00 inHg (948 mb).[19]The 1947 hurricane was the sole \"Great Hurricane\" in the late 1940s.[20]",
      "^Saffir–Simpson rankings were first given United States storms in 1975.[24]Before reanalysis the 1947 storm was ranked Category 3 in both Louisiana and Mississippi,[16]on the basis of pressure;[25]however, since the late 1980s storms have been rated by wind alone.[24]",
      "^The company belonged toSwedishindustrialistAxel Wenner-Gren.[46]",
      "^Since March heavy rains had deluged the region; by July a \"flood emergency\" prevailed.[74]Before the storm the area was waterlogged.[30][50]",
      "^The completion of theMississippi River Gulf Outletin 1968 led toerosion, so Shell Beach is submerged today.[87]",

        "content": " A series of large floods occurred in parts of the United Kingdom during the summer of 2007. The worst of the flooding occurred across parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland on 14 June; East Yorkshire and the Midlands on 15 June; Yorkshire, the Midlands, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire on 25 June; and Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and South Wales on 28 July 2007. June was one of the wettest months on record in the United Kingdom (see List of weather records). Average rainfall across the country was 5.5 inches (140 mm); more than double the June average. Some areas received a month's worth of precipitation in 24 hours.[2] It was the UK's wettest May–July period since records began in 1776.[3] July had unusually unsettled weather and above-average rainfall through the month, peaking on 20 July as an active frontal system dumped more than 4.7 inches (120 mm) of rain in southern England.[4] Civil[5] and military[5][6][7][8][9] authorities described the June and July rescue efforts as the biggest in the UK in peacetime. The Environment Agency described the July floods as critical[9] and expected them to exceed the 1947 benchmark.[10]"

        "content": "June 2007 started quietly with an anticyclone to the north of the United Kingdom maintaining a dry, cool easterly flow. From 10 June the high pressure began to break down as an upper trough moved into the area, triggering thunderstorms that caused flooding in Northern Ireland on 12 June. Later that week, a slow-moving area of low pressure from the west of Biscay moved east across the British Isles. At the same time an associated occluded front moved into northern England, becoming very active as it did so, with the peak rainfall on 15 June. Rainfall records were broken across the region,[11] leading to localised flooding. As it weakened, the front moved north into Scotland on 16 June and left England and Wales with a very unstable airmass, frequent heavy showers, thunderstorms and cloudy conditions. This led to localised flash flooding and prevented significant drying where earlier rains had fallen. On 25 June, another unseasonably low pressure (993 hPa / 29.3 inHg) depression, Cyclone Uriah,[12] moved across England. The associated front settled over northern and eastern England and dumped more than 3.9 inches (100 mm) of rain in places. The combination of high rainfall and high water levels from the earlier rainfall led to extensive flooding across many parts of England and Wales, with the Midlands, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, South, West and East Yorkshire the most affected. Gales along the east coast also caused storm damage. RAF Fylingdales on the North York Moors reported rainfall totals of 4.1 inches (103 mm) in 24 hours, an estimated 3.9 inches (100 mm) in Hull and 3.0 inches (77 mm) on Emley Moor in West Yorkshire. Until 2007, the average monthly total for June for the whole UK was 2.86 inches (72.6 mm).[13] On 27 June, the Met Office released an early warning of severe weather for the approaching weekend, stating that 0.79 to 1.97 inches (20 to 50 mm) of rain could fall in some areas, raising the possibility of more flooding within the already saturated flood plains. On 20 July, another active frontal system moved across southern England. Many places recorded a month's rainfall or more in one day. The Met Office at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire reported 4.98 inches (126.6 mm): a sixth of its annual rainfall. The college at Pershore in Worcestershire reported 5.60 inches (142.2 mm),[14] causing the Environment Agency to issue 16 further severe flood warnings.[15] By 21 July, many towns and villages were flooded, with Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, London and South Wales facing the brunt of the heavy rainfall. Climate researchers suggested that the unusual weather leading to the floods might be linked to that year's appearance of La Nina in the Pacific Ocean,[16] and to the jet stream being further south than normal.[17]"

Officials warned that the River Thames, the River Ock, and its tributaries from Charney could burst their banks.[28] Trinity School too was badly affected by flooding when the ornamental lake at Vodafone's nearby HQ overflowed from the sudden downpour, badly damaging the astroturf to the front of the school as well as causing some damage inside the school. In Reading, rail services to the southwest were affected, and westbound trains from Paddington could go no further. The flood waters affected the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Burghfield, which handles the United Kingdom's nuclear warheads, resulting in a suspension of work for almost a year.[29]"

Tewkesbury was completely cut off with no road access, parts of the town were under around 3 feet (0.9 m) of water and flood waters entered Tewkesbury Abbey for the first time in 247 years.[42] Tewkesbury's Mythe Water Treatment Works were flooded.[9] Severn Trent Water warned that treated water would run out by early Sunday evening in Tewkesbury, Cheltenham, Gloucester and surrounding areas. Combined military and civil emergency services tried to prevent floods reaching the Walham electricity substation in Gloucester supplying half a million people.[43][44] On 23 July, 50,000 Gloucestershire homes were left without electricity after a major electricity substation in Castle Meads had to be turned off.[44][45] Efforts to stop flooding at Walham substation succeeded;[46][47] the Castle Meads substation was repaired the next day.[48][49][50][51][52] By 24 July, an estimated 420,000 people were without running water, including most of the population of Gloucester, Cheltenham, and Tewkesbury.[28] Emergency services continued repair work at the Mythe water-treatment works, but Severn Trent Water estimated that water supplies would not be restored for at least 14 days.[48] 900 drinking water bowsers were brought in, and the Army was mobilised to distribute three million bottles of water a day and keep the bowsers filled. Coors, Carlsberg, Scottish and Newcastle, Inbev and Greene King brewing companies offered 23 beer tankers to help supply drinking water. On 26 July, Severn Trent Water organised a temporary non-potable water supply to 10,000 homes in Tewkesbury.[53] It was not until 7 August – 16 days after Mythe Treatment Works stopped pumping – that the tap water for the 140,000 homes affected was again declared safe to drink.[54] A man and his 24-year-old son died from asphyxiation from carbon monoxide poisoning on 27 July when attempting to stop flooding in the unventilated Tewkesbury Rugby Football Club cellar.[55][56] On 28 July, the body of a 19-year-old man, reported missing seven days earlier, was recovered in Tewkesbury.[57][58][59]"

Once supply was restored residents were urged by Welsh Water to boil their tap-water until further notice. The village of Hampton Bishop, 3 miles (5 km) from the city of Hereford, was surrounded and flooded by water after the River Lugg burst its banks. On the afternoon of 24 July the Fire Service began pumping flood water out of the village, but not before 130 residents were evacuated.[62] Some houses, including the Herefordshire home of Daily Mail writer Quentin Letts, were flooded by a torrent of water gushing from what had previously been only a small, unnamed brook north of Ross-on-Wye.

By 26 June, the waters in some parts of Sheffield and the surrounding area receded, and over 700 villagers from Catcliffe, near Rotherham's Ulley reservoir were evacuated after cracks appeared in the dam.[81][106] Emergency services from across England pumped millions of gallons of water from the reservoir to ease the pressure on the damaged dam, and the nearby M1 Motorway was closed between junctions 32 and 36 as a precaution.[107] On 27 June, the Army moved into the Doncaster area after the River Don overtopped its banks and threatened the area around what was Thorpe Marsh Power Station. A man was incorrectly reported missing near the village of Adwick le Street near Doncaster.[108]"

Brown also pledged to push insurance firms to make payouts. On 22 July, the Government convened COBRA to co-ordinate the response to the crisis.[154] Visiting Gloucestershire on 25 July, Mr. Brown praised emergency services for their efforts, but added: \"We've got to get the supplies stepped up. We will get more tankers in, we will get more bowsers in, we will get more regular filling of them, and at the same time, more bottled water will be provided.\"[53] On 8 August 2007, Defra announced that Sir Michael Pitt would chair an independent review of the response to the flooding. On 4 September of that year the Cabinet Office website launched a comments page to let people affected by the flooding contribute their experiences to the review. Sir Michael published his interim report on 17 December 2007.[155] In April 2010 the government passed the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which implemented many of Sir Michael Pitt's recommendations.[156] The Act gives more power and responsibility to the Environment Agency and local authorities to plan flood defences co-ordinated across catchment areas and the wider country, to counteract the tendency for defences to be built for upstream areas without much thought for how this might be making flooding worse for downstream areas. In also brings in a new regime whereby new building activity which exacerbates flooding by reducing the capacity of land to absorb water will need to be accompanied by the construction of sustainable drainage systems such as grassy roofs, ponds and soakaways."

        "header": "Criticism of government response",
        "content": "In June, councillors in Hull claimed that the city was being forgotten and had the floods occurred in the Home Counties, help would have arrived much more quickly. One in five homes in Hull was damaged and 90 out of the city's 105 schools suffered some damage. Damage to the schools alone was estimated to cost £100 million. The Bellwin scheme for providing aid after natural disasters was criticised as inadequate by Hull MP Diana Johnson.[158] The lack of media coverage of flooding in Kingston upon Hull led the city council leader Carl Minns to dub Hull \"the forgotten city\". In July, the Government came under mounting criticism of its handling of the crisis, the fact that responsibilities were spread across four departments and no single minister could be held responsible, and the fact that the Army had not been called in to assist.[159] The Observer newspaper stated on 22 July 2007 that the Government had been warned in the spring by the Met Office that summer flooding would be likely because the El Niño phenomenon had weakened, but no action was taken.[160] In response to the criticism, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said on BBC Sunday AM that \"This was very, very intense rainfall, with five inches in 24 hours in some areas; even some of the best defences are going to be overwhelmed\". He praised the way the emergency services had dealt with \"unprecedented\" levels of rainfall and said he had \"total confidence\" in the response of the Environment Agency. Conservative leader David Cameron called for a public inquiry into the flooding after visiting Witney, the main town in his Oxfordshire constituency.[161] Then Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell accused the government of lack of preparation leading to a \"summer of suffering\", and said, \"With sophisticated weather forecasting as we now have, particularly in relation to what's happened over the weekend, there are quite a few questions as to how it was that flood-prevention measures were not in place or were not more effective.\"[162]"

        "content": " The Great Flood of 1993 (or Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993) was a flood that occurred in the Midwestern United States, along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and their tributaries, from April to October 1993. The flood is among the most costly and devastating to ever occur in the United States, with 50 dead and US$12–16 billion in damages (equivalent to $23–30 billion in 2023). The hydrographic basin affected an area approximately totaling 320,000 square miles (830,000 km2), of about 745 miles (1,199 km) in length and about 435 miles (700 km) in width.[2] Within this zone, the flooded area totaled around 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2)[3] and was the worst such U.S. disaster since the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, as measured by duration, area inundated, persons displaced, crop and property damage, and number of record river levels. In some categories, the 1993 flood even surpassed the 1927 flood, at the time the largest flood ever recorded on the Mississippi River."

        "content": "A volcanic winter is thought to have started with the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. It has been suggested that excess cloud condensation nuclei from the eruption were responsible for the Great Flood of 1993 in the Midwestern United States.[4] Above-normal rainfall and below-normal temperatures beginning in the summer of 1992 resulted in above-normal soil moisture and reservoir levels in the Missouri and Upper Mississippi River basins. This weather pattern persisted throughout the following autumn. During the winter of 1992–93, the region experienced heavy snowfall. These conditions were followed by persistent spring weather patterns that produced storms over the same locations. Soils across much of the affected area were saturated by June 1, with additional rainfall all running off into streams and rivers, instead of soaking into the ground.[2] These wet-weather conditions contrasted sharply with the droughts and heat waves experienced in the southeastern United States. Storms, persistent and repetitive in nature during the late spring and summer, crowded the Upper Midwest with voluminous rainfall. Portions of east-central Iowa received as much as 48 inches (120 cm) of rain between April 1 and August 31, 1993, and many areas across the central-northern plains had precipitation 400–750% above normal.[2]  In the St. Louis National Weather Service (NWS) forecast area encompassing eastern Missouri and southwest Illinois, 36 forecast points rose above flood stage, and 20 river-stage records were broken. The 1993 flood broke record river levels set during the 1973 Mississippi and the 1951 Missouri River floods. Civil Air Patrol crews from 21 states served more than 5,000 meals to flood victims and volunteers, and their pilots logged more than 1,500 hours in the air inspecting utility lines and pipelines.[5] Over 1,000 flood warnings and statements, five times the normal, were issued to notify the public and need-to-know officials of river levels. In such places as St. Louis, river levels were nearly 20 feet (6.1 m) above flood stage, the highest ever recorded there in 228 years.[6] The 52-foot (16 m)-high St. Louis Floodwall, built to handle the volume of the 1844 flood, was able to keep the 1993 flood out with just over two feet (0.61 m) to spare.[7]  This floodwall was built in the 1960s, to great controversy, out of interlocking prefabricated concrete blocks.[citation needed] Emergency officials estimated that nearly all of the 700 privately built agricultural levees were overtopped or destroyed along the Missouri River. Navigation on the Mississippi and Missouri River had been closed since early July, resulting in a loss of $2 million (1993) per day in commerce. James Scott, a 23-year-old Illinois man, was convicted in 1994 for \"intentionally causing a catastrophe\" and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in causing some of the flooding across the river from Quincy, Illinois. In an attempt to strand his wife on the other side of the river so he could continue partying, Scott allegedly removed several sandbags from a levee holding back the water. The breach flooded 14,000 acres (57 km2) of farmland, destroyed buildings, and closed a bridge.[8][9] His conviction was overturned in 1997, but reinstated in 1998. He maintains his innocence behind bars.[10]"

From May through July, Sioux Falls, South Dakota received 22.55 inches (573 mm) of rain, the wettest three-month period in its history.[12]"

        "content": "As noted above, rains in South Dakota contributed to flooding downstream. In June, flooding occurred along the Black River in Wisconsin, with flooding also starting to occur along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Kansas rivers.[11]  Starting as early as June 7, reports of levees being overtopped and levee breaks became common. These breaches acted to delay the flood crests, temporarily storing excess water in the adjacent lowlands, but the rain kept falling. In the beginning of June, the Missouri and Mississippi rivers dropped below flood stage and were receding. During the second week of June, river levels rose to near flood stage before yet again beginning their slow recession. By the end of June, the Mississippi River was four feet (1.2 m) below flood stage at St. Louis, while many other river locations in the region were near flood stage. Precipitation for the month averaged from one inch (25 mm) above normal in Kansas City, to nearly four inches (100 mm) above normal in Springfield, Missouri."

        "header": "July",
        "content": "July brought more heavy rain to the Missouri and upper Mississippi River basins in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Illinois, and Minnesota. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches (130 to 180 millimetres) in 24 hours were common. Precipitation for the month averaged from one inch (25 mm) above normal at St. Louis and Springfield, to between six and seven inches (150 and 180 mm) above normal at Columbia and Kansas City, Missouri.[citation needed] In Iowa, the flood waters brought mass destruction. On July 9, four buildings on Iowa State University's campus flooded; resulting in over 1.4 million dollars in estimated damages and six weeks of construction to reopen.[13] The college's indoor sports arena, Hilton Coliseum, was flooded with as much as fourteen feet of water.[14] From July 11 until July 22, the Des Moines Water Works was flooded by the Raccoon River. This resulted in the plant being powered down, unable to provide running water for that period. On July 13, electricity returned to more than 35,000 residents. That same day President Bill Clinton toured Iowa's capitol and neighboring cities alongside Governor Terry Branstad. He later declared a state of disaster for Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri and asked Congress to approve 2.5 billion dollars in Federal disaster relief.[15] During this time the Army National Guard and American Red Cross set up water stations, and the local Anheuser-Busch distributor contributed water in white six-packs with their logo on it. Once running water was restored, there was enough pressure for people to bathe and flush toilets, but the water was not certified potable until July 29. The final usage restrictions were lifted in August.[citation needed] Major sandbagging activities took place along the higher Missouri River, the River des Peres in St. Louis, the Mississippi River south of St. Louis, and on many other tributaries across Missouri and Illinois. Some of these efforts were successful, while others were not. The copious rain during July sent record-setting crests down the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, causing river gauges to malfunction along the way. The record crests met within days of each other at their confluence near St. Louis. Navigation on the Mississippi and Missouri River was closed in early July, resulting in a loss of $2 million (1993) per day in commerce.[16] Mississippi River levels stabilized for a few days at April 1973 record stages. When the crest from the Missouri River arrived, levels rose again. The Mississippi River broke through levees, drove people and their possessions to higher ground, and caused havoc through the floodplains.[citation needed] The crests, now combined as one, moved downstream through St. Louis on the way to the Upper Mississippi's confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois. Only minor flooding occurred below Cairo due to the Lower Mississippi's larger channel below that point, as well as drought conditions in the eastern U.S. If the Ohio River watershed had not been in drought while the Missouri and Upper Mississippi were in flood, the 1993 flood might have rivaled the 1927 flood in overall damage on the Lower Mississippi, beyond Cairo.[citation needed]"

        "content": "On August 1, levee breaks near Columbia, Illinois, flooded 47,000 acres (190 km2) of land, inundating the Illinois towns of Valmeyer and Fults. The released water continued to flow parallel to the river, approaching the levees protecting historic Prairie du Rocher and Fort de Chartres. On August 3, officials decided to break through the stronger Mississippi River levee to allow the water back into the river. The plan worked and the historic areas were saved, although some residential areas were flooded in counties above Prairie du Rocher. The Mississippi River at St. Louis crested at 49.6 feet (15.1 m) on August 1, nearly 20 feet (6.1 m)[17] above flood stage. It had a peak flow rate of 1,080,000 ft3/s (30,600 m3/s). At this rate, a bowl the size of Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis would be filled to the brim in 70 seconds."

On the Mississippi, Grafton, Illinois, recorded flooding for 195 days; Clarksville, Missouri, for 187 days; Winfield, Missouri, for 183 days; Hannibal, Missouri, for 174 days; and Quincy, Illinois, for 152 days. The Missouri River was above flood stage for 62 days in Jefferson City, Missouri, 77 days at Hermann, Missouri, and for 94 days at St. Charles in the St. Louis metropolitan area. On October 7, 103 days after the flooding began, the Mississippi River at St. Louis finally dropped below flood stage. Approximately 100,000 homes were destroyed as a result of the flooding, 15,000,000 acres (23,000 sq mi; 61,000 km2) of farmland inundated, and the whole towns of Valmeyer, Illinois, and Rhineland, Missouri, were relocated to higher ground.[2] Reports in 1994 set the deaths due to the flood at 38,[1] though this had been revised to 50 deaths by 1996.[2] The fiscal cost is estimated at $12–16 billion (equivalent to $23–30 billion in 2023).[1][2] Even after the water was gone, large amounts of sand still covered the farmlands and homes.[18]"

        "content": " The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 was the most destructive river flood in the history of the United States, with 27,000 square miles (70,000 km2) inundated in depths of up to 30 feet (9 m) over the course of several months in early 1927. The period cost of the damage has been estimated to be between $246 million and $1 billion, which ranges from $3.5–$14.1 billion in 2023 dollars.[1] About 500 people died and over 630,000 people were directly affected; 94% of those affected lived in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, especially in the Mississippi Delta region. 127 people died in Arkansas, making it one of the deadliest disasters ever recorded in the state.[2] More than 200,000 African Americans were displaced from their homes along the Lower Mississippi River and had to live for lengthy periods in relief camps. As a result of this disruption, many joined the Great Migration from the South to the industrial cities of the North and the Midwest; the migrants preferred to move, rather than return to rural agricultural labor.[3] To prevent future floods, the federal government built the world's longest system of levees and floodways. Then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's handling of the crisis gave him a positive nationwide reputation, helping pave the way to his election as U.S. President in 1928. Political turmoil from the disaster at the state level aided the election of Huey Long as governor in Louisiana."

        "content": "By the late nineteenth century, the United States was well aware of flooding potential along the Mississippi, which drained 40% of the nation's area. The Mississippi River Commission was established by the federal government in 1879, with the directive to deepen the river channel, improve navigation, prevent major flooding, and increase river-based commerce. This commission recommended raising extensive levees along its channels to contain the flow, dismissing the advice of experts such as James Eads, who had directed the Saint Louis Bridge project in the 1860s. These critics predicted that compressing a swollen river between walls would increase its destructive potential.[1] Flooding began due to heavy rainfall in summer 1926 across the river's central basin. By September, the Mississippi's tributaries in Kansas and Iowa were swollen to capacity. On Christmas Day of 1926,[4] the Cumberland River at Nashville, Tennessee, exceeded 56.2 ft (17.1 m), the second-highest recorded level (a destructive flood in 1793 had produced the record level – 58.5 ft (17.8 m)).[5] Flooding peaked in the Lower Mississippi River near Mound Landing, Mississippi, and Arkansas City, Arkansas, and broke levees along the river in at least 145 places.[6] The water flooded more than 27,000 square miles (70,000 km2) of land, and left more than 700,000 people homeless. Approximately 500 people died as a result of flooding.[7] Monetary damages due to flooding reached approximately $1 billion, which was one-third of the federal budget in 1927. If the event were to have occurred in 2023, the damages would total around $1.38 trillion to $1.48 trillion. The flood affected Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. Arkansas was hardest hit, with 14% of its territory covered by floodwaters extending from the Mississippi and Arkansas deltas. By May 1927, the Mississippi River below Memphis, Tennessee, reached a width of 80 miles (130 km).[8] Without trees, grasses, deep roots, and wetlands, the denuded soil of the watershed could not do its ancient work of absorbing floodwater after seasons of intense snow and rain.[9]"

        "content": "In an unrelated flood at the same time, on Good Friday (15 April 1927), 15 inches (380 mm) of rain fell in New Orleans in 18 hours.[10]  This far exceeded the City's rainwater pumping system, and up to 4 feet (1.2 m) of water flooded some parts of the city. This local rain related flood was not connected to the Mississippi River flooding. A group of influential bankers in New Orleans met to discuss how to guarantee the safety of the city, as they had already learned of the massive scale of flooding upriver.[10] On 29 April they arranged to set off about 30 tons of dynamite on the levee at Caernarvon, Louisiana, releasing 250,000 cu ft/s (7,000 m3/s) of water. This was intended to prevent New Orleans from suffering serious damage, and it resulted in flooding much of the less densely populated St. Bernard Parish and all of Plaquemines Parish's east bank. As it turned out, the destruction of the Caernarvon levee was unnecessary; several major levee breaks well upstream of New Orleans, including one the day after the demolitions, released major amounts of flood waters, reducing the water that reached the city. The New Orleans businessmen did not compensate the losses of people in the downriver parishes.[11] To address the disaster, Congress passed the Mississippi Flood Control Act, which put greater stress on construction in the Mississippi Delta levee camps despite warnings from the NAACP about harsh living conditions and mistreatment of black laborers within the camps.[citation needed]"

        "content": "By August 1927, the flood subsided. Hundreds of thousands of people had been made homeless and displaced; properties, livestock and crops were destroyed. In terms of population affected, in territory flooded, in property loss and crop destruction, the flood's figures were \"staggering\". Great loss of life was averted by relief efforts, largely by the American Red Cross through the efforts of local workers.[12] [unreliable source?] African Americans, comprising 75% of the population in the Delta lowlands and supplying 95% of the agricultural labor force, were most affected by the flood. Historians estimate that of the 637,000 people forced to relocate by the flooding, 94% lived in three states: Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana; and that 69% of the 325,146 who occupied the relief camps were African American.[13] In one location, over 13,000 evacuees near Greenville, Mississippi, were gathered from area farms, and evacuated to the crest of the unbroken Greenville Levee. But many were stranded there for days without food or clean water.[citation needed]"

        "content": "Following the Great Flood of 1927, multiple states needed money to rebuild their roads and bridges. Louisiana received $1,067,336 from the federal government for rebuilding,[14] but it had to institute a state gasoline tax to create a $30,000,000 fund to pay for new hard-surfaced highways.[15] The Corps of Engineers was charged with taming the Mississippi River. Under the Flood Control Act of 1928, the world's longest system of levees was built. Floodways that diverted excessive flow from the Mississippi River were constructed.[16] While the levees prevented some flooding, scientists have found that they changed the flow of the Mississippi River, with the unintended consequence of increasing flooding in succeeding decades. Channeling of waters has reduced the absorption of seasonal rains by the floodplains, increasing the speed of the current and preventing the deposit of new soils along the way. The levees did not prevent recurrences of significant flooding, especially a major flood in 1937. To better study and plan for future situations, Lt. Eugene Raybold proposed laying out a physical hydraulic model to simulate the basin's response to various rainfall scenarios. Land was procured at the SE edge of Clinton, Mississippi, and a 200-acre hydraulic model was constructed, matching to the river's flow from Baton Rouge to Omaha, modeling the confluence points of its major tributaries across 16 states. The work was completed during 1942, with some labor provided by POWs from Camp Clinton.[17][18] The Corps used this model to accurately study river flows and mitigation strategies, but by 1970 it fell out of use. In the 1970s it was transferred to the city government of Jackson, and the Buddy Butts Park[19] was created around it.[20] It is presently little-known or recognized.[21][22] The devastation of the flood and the strained racial relations resulted in many African Americans joining the Great Migration from affected areas to northern and midwestern cities, a movement that had been underway since World War I. The flood waters began to recede in June 1927, but interracial relations continued to be strained. Hostilities had erupted between the races; a Black man was shot and killed by a white police officer when he refused to unload a relief boat at gunpoint.[23][24] Near Helena, Arkansas, Owen Flemming was lynched after he killed a plantation overseer, who wanted to force him to rescue the plantation owner's mules.[25] As a result of displacements lasting up to six months, tens of thousands of local African Americans moved to the big cities of the North, particularly Chicago; many thousands more followed in the following decades.[26][27] Herbert Hoover enhanced his reputation by his achievements in directing flood relief operations as Secretary of Commerce under President Calvin Coolidge. The next year Hoover easily won the Republican 1928 nomination for President, and the general election that year. In upstate Louisiana, anger among yeomen farmers directed at the New Orleans elite for its damage of downriver parishes aided Huey Long's election to the governorship in 1928.[28]: 408–409, 477, 487  Hoover was much lauded initially for his masterful handling of the refugee camps known as \"tent cities\".[29] These densely populated camps required basic necessities which were difficult to attain, such as water and sanitation facilities. Hoover used a combination of bureaucratic resources and grassroots forces to give the tent cities the opportunity to become self-sufficient. This method presented difficulties, as rural leaders were unprepared to manage the chaotic circumstances found in large camps. This led Hoover eventually to place the relief camps under government supervision.[29] The refugee camps also dealt with extreme racial inequality, as supplies and means of evacuation after flooding were given strictly to white citizens, with Blacks receiving only leftovers. African Americans also did not receive supplies without providing the name of their white employer or voucher from a white person. In order to fully exploit black labor, Blacks were frequently forced to work against their will, and were not permitted to leave the camps.[30] Later reports about the poor treatment in camps led Hoover to make promises of change to the African-American community, which he broke. As a result, he lost the Black vote in the North in his re-election campaign in 1932.[28]: 259–290 [note 1] Several reports on the terrible situation in the refugee camps, including one by the Colored Advisory Commission headed by Robert Russa Moton, were kept out of the media at Hoover's request, with the pledge of further reforms for Blacks after the presidential election in 1928. His failure to deliver followed other disappointments by the Republican Party; Moton and other influential African Americans began to encourage Black Americans to align instead with the national Democrats.[28]: 415"
