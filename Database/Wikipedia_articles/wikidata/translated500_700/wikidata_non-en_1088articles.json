These floods mainly affected Holland. Throughout the year 1163, the region had been affected by floods, causing several dike breaches along the Meuse. The main consequence of the St. Thomas flood was a complete blockage of the Old Rhine's mouth at Katwijk, which was already heavily silted. As a result, the Rhine could no longer discharge its waters into the North Sea. Several polders in Holland and Utrecht were flooded. On the orders of Floris III and without consultation, the Old Rhine was dammed at Zwammerdam in 1165, but from that moment, Utrecht also faced flooding, leading to a short war between Utrecht and Holland. Around 1200, a new drainage channel was dug via the Haarlemmermeer further north, thus resolving the water issue."

The final touches were being made to the Maeslantkering at the Nieuwe Waterweg near Hoek van Holland, the last part of the Delta Works. The last high water disaster along the Meuse was in 1926. However, in December 1993, high water in the Meuse broke records. In the area around Roermond and Venlo, the river overflowed uncontrollably, and villages located outside the dikes were flooded. With three thousand cubic meters of water per second, more water had never flowed through the river. Thousands of houses were submerged, and about 12,000 people had to be evacuated. Analyses of recordings by the air force revealed that the river dikes were weak and unreliable in many places."

Other rivers also quickly became overfilled; on January 25, the water level of the Rhine at Tolkamer rose by two meters in a single day. A few days later, the Rhine overflowed in the German city of Cologne. In large parts of Gelderland, the water reached the tops of the dikes, and in Deventer, the quays were flooded. Due to the immense pressure, groundwater also rose. Many dike roads were closed to traffic, and crisis centers prepared for large-scale evacuations, with dike monitoring implemented everywhere. Threatened villages and cities organized flood disaster teams under the leadership of the mayor. The army and civilians filled and placed long rows of sandbags on the dikes. If the threatening dike breaches had become a reality, many areas in the Betuwe, the Bommelerwaard, and the Land van Maas en Waal would have been submerged up to about five meters. This meant that only the attics of many homes would remain dry. There would not have been enough time to evacuate afterward. Therefore, residents were informed that mandatory evacuation would take place on very short notice. Belongings were hastily moved to the upper floors, which might remain dry in case of flooding. Livestock and household goods were transported out of the threatened area. In Dutch Limburg, there were limited floods between January 22 and 28. The un-diked villages of Itteren and Borgharen, after the Meuse flooding in 1993, were submerged for the second time. Near Deventer, a dike of the IJssel was at risk of giving way."

The Rhine branches and the Meuse have been given more space to safely discharge water through the implementation of the Room for the River program. With the opening of the Reevediep high-water channel in early 2019, the last project of Room for the River was officially completed."

On the late evening of February 13, 1648, \"violent storm winds\" arose, which developed into a hurricane overnight, accompanied by rain and hail showers. In the Elbe estuary and on the Elbe, various ships sank or were pushed ashore. The hurricane toppled the church towers of Glückstadt, Krempe, Wewelsfleth, Brokdorf, Kollmar, Horst, Uetersen, Rellingen, Wedel, and the St. Catherine's Church in Hamburg. At the same time, it destroyed countless buildings, lands, and uprooted hundreds of thousands of trees. Thousands of people were in extreme distress and danger. Within hours, a devastating storm surge followed, as well as—allegedly—an earthquake that triggered fires. During the storm surge, parts of the low-lying Elbe marshes were flooded meters high. Due to the simultaneous earthquake, more church towers and buildings collapsed and also caught fire. Countless people and animals lost their lives, the area was completely flooded and devastated for several months, followed by \"great and diverse misery.\""

                "content": "The main source for the storm is the poem \"Holstein, forget it not\" by the Wedel pastor and poet Johann Rist, along with the accompanying reports of several eyewitnesses who described the devastation caused by the storm in their parish. Most of these eyewitnesses were pastors from the neighborhood who were friends with Rist, and other friends of Rist, such as Georg Greflinger, also contributed their own eyewitness accounts, some in poetic form. In Krempe, the church tower was destroyed, but fortunately, the rest of the church, including the altar, pulpit, baptismal font, organ, and bells, remained intact, as reported by Pastor Johann Hudemann. In Wedel, entire houses were washed up in the higher-lying districts. The church tower of St. Catherine's Church in Hamburg was \"lifted from its original masonry and fell onto one side of the church roof with such a terrible crash and clatter that it was believed heaven and earth had collapsed or merged together.\" In Drage, \"the tower, which had always stood a few steps away from the church, was firmly moved to the walls of the church without shifting its structure.\" Similarly, it was reported from Bad Bramstedt: \"On the Monday after Esto mihi at night around 11 o'clock, a great earthquake arose from the storm wind, through which the church tower was knocked down, causing great damage to the church, so that six new beams along with the rafter structure had to be brought in again.\" Johann Rist reported on this catastrophe: \"[...] between Monday and Tuesday during Shrovetide week, such a terrible storm arose that the earth along with the largest buildings trembled and quaked, and at the same time such dreadful thunder and lightning were seen and heard that perhaps no person under heaven can be found who has ever experienced anything like it: Yes, large pieces or lumps of fire are said to have fallen on the city of Freiburg or other places in the same area [...].\" The Wedel pastor further reported: \"Yet I have found nothing that can truly be compared to what we experienced. For where has it ever been seen that such a storm wind and earthquake arose simultaneously, which in such a short time within three hours caused such incredible damage, crushed and destroyed so many buildings, towers, spires, churches, houses, mills, and the like, uprooted so many hundreds of thousands of trees, and brought people into such fear and distress that, if it had been possible, they would have gladly seen themselves in the abyss of the earth.\" Rist's poem itself consists of 800 Alexandrines, accompanied by extensive notes. Rist interpreted this storm, as well as the death of King Christian IV just a few days later, as a sign of divine wrath, primarily due to the excesses of Shrovetide. In his book, he not only described the catastrophe itself but also called on his congregation and readers to repent. For this purpose, the book also contains a long penitential hymn with 16 eight-line stanzas. Since this hymn was accompanied by musical notation, it was likely intended to be sung during worship services."

The storm surge flooded large parts of the Belgian, Dutch, German, and Danish coasts. Based on historical accounts, it is estimated that several thousand people died in North Frisia. In East Frisia, the villages of Osterbur and Ostbense were lost. At St. Nicholas Church in Klixbüll, the height marker from 1532 (NN+4.16 m) is the oldest preserved marker of a North Sea storm surge. On Fanø, the easternmost settlement of Albo was lost. For the island of Strand, which was torn apart in 1634, the All Saints' Flood of 1532 was one of the most devastating floods of the 16th century, with chroniclers reporting eleven dike breaches and 1,500 people drowning."

The tidal wave in the Netherlands in 1014 refers to a significant tidal wave named (Stormvloed in Dutch) that occurred on September 28 and 29, 1014, in the Netherlands. It was probably the first breakthrough of the sea through the almost closed coastline of the lowlands in the southern Netherlands. The previous major disaster was the great flood of December 21, 838. The storm of 1014 first hit the English coastline and then continental Europe, pushing the North Sea over the dikes of present-day Zeeland, which was part of Frisia and Flanders. According to sources from that time, the Netherlands, and particularly the former island of Walcheren, suffered heavy damage. Restoration likely took an unusually long time. The chronicle of the Quedlinburg Abbey in Saxony reports that there were thousands of deaths."

There had already been a considerable northwesterly storm in the days prior, and on the 23rd, it reached its peak. It was the most severe flood since the All Saints' Flood of 1570. Heavily affected areas and places included: Waterland north of Amsterdam with Zaandam and Westzaan, and Medemblik, Enkhuizen, Hoorn, Texel, Wieringen, Dordrecht, Rotterdam, Workum, Hindeloopen, Stavoren. The Emerentia flood is named after the day (January 23). If using the Julian calendar, it is called the Pontian flood (January 14). The storm surge was the result of four days of stormy weather from the northwest. In the days prior, this had already caused high tides, but on this day, the storm battered the coasts of Flanders, Holland, Germany, and Denmark even more severely. The dikes had already been weakened by the storm that had struck a year earlier on February 11 and 18, 1609. And because the storm had already caused some dikes to break in the days before, large parts of North Holland, South Holland, Friesland, Groningen, Gelderland, and Overijssel were flooded. The village of Petten was at risk of being completely washed into the sea along with its dunes. Nearly two-thirds of the island of Texel was submerged. In Medemblik, water filled the streets, and Enkhuizen was also hit. The water reached up to the church there. The entire northern part of Overijssel, the river basin of the IJssel and the Maas, was completely flooded. In Groningen, the Emderland was underwater. The damage caused by this flood was enormous. Many houses and barns were washed away, and much livestock drowned."

This was written by secretary Jehan Purtyck on behalf of commissioner Jacob van Quesnoy, both associated with the Court of Holland, and was deciphered by Lex Ritman in 1965. The storm disasters caused numerous damages and even dike breaches, forcing the construction of inner dikes (dike sections moved inward), as in 1532, 1552, and 1566, which were mentioned in the manuscript. Inner dikes were constructed not only in cases of dike breaches, where the dike could not be restored to its original location due to scour holes, but also when it was realized that a dike could no longer be maintained due to the reduction of the foreland (area outside the dike). These inner dikes created a \"horn or curve,\" a bend in the dike. The manuscript referred to an \"inlaegerdyck\" (inner dike) or \"ingeleyde dyck\" (laid-in dike). The inward relocation of a dike that could no longer be maintained was called an \"inlaege\" (inlay). Today, the terms inner dikes and inlays are understood differently, which can lead to confusion. In the manuscript, the dike section that was left outside the new inner dike was called a \"dyckstal\" (dike stall). At the inner dike between Axwijk and Kwadijk and the one in front of the Bernardine monastery of Galilee, between Nieuwendam and Ilpendam, the old dike stall still remained."

As a result, the water struck with great force against the sea dikes of Drechterland, Zeevang, Katwoude, Waterland, Marken, Amstelland, and Gooiland, causing severe damage in several places. In addition to the sea dikes, some inner dikes were also seriously damaged, such as the Beemsterdijk near and in Oosthuizen, where it was written in the manuscript that the waves crashed over the dike against the western wall of the church, damaging the dike and causing the church gutter's kettle to overflow because it could not handle the water. The damage to the Beemsterdijk in front of the church was all the greater because the foreland was missing and was also absent or very narrow in other places. The inner dike laid north of Hobrede in 1566 was undoubtedly attributable to this storm disaster."

In general, it could be stated that half of the landowners had little more than a \"croene opte deympte\" (coin and land measure) in expenses to bear, while the rest had to spend more or less on repairs. Such a storm was not common, and only 8 or 10 years ago had there been some storms that had severely damaged the Oostdijk."

They wanted to deliberate on the costs caused by the storm disaster. At this meeting, a petition from the residents of the Oosterweren, located east of the Ye (the Die), was read aloud by the mayor of Edam, Claes Heynricxz. Lou. This petition was addressed to the \"common court\" of Edam and the \"peacemakers\" of Zeevang. The Oosterweren requested permission to construct a secondary dike in the Oostdijk at the expense of the entire Zeevang. The response from the meeting was that the residents of the Oosterweren first had to ensure the necessary dike repairs and could then submit a new request, but in principle, there was no objection to this secondary dike being constructed by the \"common land\" as a \"common work.\" In short: at communal expense. According to witnesses from the manuscript, this secondary dike was very likely constructed, as no refusal had been heard of."

Also, walen that had since disappeared without a trace due to being filled in were mentioned if they could still be remembered in 1567. In the sixteenth century, these were called braeck, breeck, wael, weel, grontbraeck, and grontwael. These whirlpools formed on the inner side during a dike breach and, according to those present, were older than the Nieuwendam over the Purmeraa (1400 or 1401), which provided protection against the Zuiderzee, around the Purmer and Beemster. There were two exceptions to this: the waal south of the Slingerdijk (between Oosthuizen and Etersheim) and one in the Axwijker dike. The latter had been diked out by the construction of an inner dike. The manuscript described in detail how the walen looked in 1567. They could consist entirely of water or partially, with the rest overgrown with reeds/rushes. They could also have become completely overgrown. Furthermore, some holes had been completely or partially filled. In the latter case, the remaining surface consisted of water, water and reeds/rushes, or entirely of these plants. The walen were filled with earth, sods, or mud and then used as hayland, oatland, yards, or building land for houses. Between the Nieuwendam and Ilpendam, there were 7 walen, and between this place and Purmerend, even 22. Slightly to the east of that, there was 1 waal. Between Edam and Axwijk, there were 2 walen, and in this place itself, 4. Going from Axwijk to Kwadijk, one encountered 2, and in Kwadijk itself, there were 7 (there used to be a few more). Between Hobrede and Oosthuizen, no walen were found, and south of the Slingerdijk, there was 1 (from 1552). Around the Purmer, about 50 walen were mentioned, but there must have been more in earlier times. Some names are known: Dirck Heynezoons braeck and Gerrit Foppezoons braeck in Axwijk, and Cruysbreeck, Willem Maertszoons braeck, Jacob Wouterszoons braeck, and Campbreeck in Kwadijk."

The names of some secondary dikes are known. Between Edam and the Nieuwendam, the first was the Driespronck, and from the western end of Axwijk to the eastern end of Kwadijk stretched the Quae Horn. An interesting detail is that to the west and east of Axwijk, there was a polder lake outside the dike created by the secondary dike, while in front of the Bernardine monastery of Galilee, between the Nieuwendam and Ilpendam, there was a polder lake behind the secondary dike. These polder lakes and secondary dikes are already mentioned above."

The Pannerden Canal, forming the section of the Lower Rhine at the division of the Rhine into two branches, freezes. As a result, a large portion of the Rhine's waters that were supposed to flow into the Lek is forced to pass through the Waal. In mid-January, the Waal's dikes give way in two places: in Lent, near Nijmegen, and in Loenen, a few kilometers downstream. The river's water pours like a torrent inland, destroying farms and villages. The bulk of the flooding is stopped by the Diefdijk, a dike crossing the Betuwe between Gorinchem, Leerdam, and Culemborg, thus forming a true inland sea. While the Betuwe is the hardest-hit region, floods occurred throughout the area between the Meuse and the Rhine, up to Arnhem. Starting on January 28, the King of Holland, Louis Bonaparte, travels to Gorinchem to assess the extent of the damage and support the affected populations. Louis himself helps reinforce the dikes with sandbags, coordinates relief efforts, and visits the most isolated villages in the territory to encourage the population. To facilitate the water's flow, the dike is breached at Dalem. These efforts are in vain as the Diefdijk also gives way on January 31 near Kedichem, and the flooding extends across the entire Betuwe, reaching Alblasserdam. The damages are estimated by the Ministry of the Interior at 6 million florins."

When the ice started moving that day, the water broke through the Grebbe dike, creating a 150-meter-wide breach in the dike in a very short time. The damage was immense, and several houses were severely damaged or completely destroyed. The exact number of fatalities is unknown. Subsequently, King William III visited the Land of Maas and Waal. He would later award honors to people who had rendered exceptional service during this disaster. Since 1855, there have been no more floods in the Gelderse Valley. However, it was not until 1931 that a commission was established to further investigate the drainage in the Gelderse Valley and make recommendations. In 1955 and 2005, the flood disaster was officially commemorated in Veenendaal. On the Kerkewijk, there is a monument with the names of eleven victims of the disaster, and part of the exhibition in Museum Veenendaal is dedicated to the disaster. A memorial stone has also been placed on the quay wall of Renswoude Castle."

On the night of January 30 to 31, 1877, the polder was struck by a storm surge, resulting in 14 fatalities; hours before the water reached its highest level, it was already spilling over the dike. The dike broke in two places simultaneously, and within a few hours, the entire polder was submerged. The situation was worst in the workers' houses with single-brick walls. Some houses collapsed with the residents who had climbed onto the roofs. Others tried to reach the farms, but not all succeeded. With boats from Zoutkamp, the polder residents were rescued with great difficulty the following day. Some families did not survive the disaster. Thirteen victims were buried in a mass grave in Vierhuizen. The fourteenth victim, a girl visiting the polder, was buried in Houwerzijl. In 1931, a simple monument was erected to commemorate the disaster. In the nearby Zoutkamp, the dikes held, but even there, two people, a man and a woman, lost their lives."

The breach at Nieuwe Statenzijl is described in a 1906 booklet by J. Bakker from Drieborg, who was an eyewitness to the disaster. He reported that the wind turned into a hurricane by the evening of January 30th, and the Dollard became like a roaring lion. The workers did not understand the nature of the Dollard and had no idea what awaited them. They did not flee even as the water began to surge over the dikes. By 11 o'clock in the evening, the sluice could no longer withstand the seawater, and the sluice keeper, who had only moved into the new sluice keeper's house fourteen days earlier, took refuge in the gauge house with 16 other people. Everything around the gauge house was swept away; the sluice and the sluice keeper's house were completely destroyed. The arrival of daylight was awaited with anxious anticipation. The scene was most sorrowful, according to Mr. Bakker's account. All the houses had been washed away: the seemingly indestructible sluice house, the sluice, the dikes, both on the Dutch and German sides. When investigations were later conducted, 35 bodies of men, women, and children were found. Women were still clutching their children in their arms. The flood had overwhelmed and swept them away. In a large grave at the cemetery in Ditzumerverlaat, 27 victims were buried in one day, and another eight the following day. Two bodies that washed ashore on the Dutch side were brought to Nieuw-Beerta and buried there. Farmer J.H. Ebels rendered great service during this disaster. He provided shelter to many in his barn and supplied them with food. At the German border office opposite Oude Statenzijl, a cradle with a sleeping child drifted ashore."

Especially the area around Zwolle experienced several dike breaches, causing a large number of houses to collapse and leaving 260 people homeless. Tragic was the accident with the steamship Willem III, en route from Sneek to Stavoren. On the Fluessen lake, the cabin windows of the ship broke, causing it to take on water. When the rudder also broke, the ship became stranded. Although the ship did not completely sink, 20 people drowned. The survivors had to wait fifteen hours to be rescued, either hanging in the masts or standing on the bridge up to their chests in water. At sea, 31 people lost their lives in three shipwrecks."

                "content": "A prevailing westerly wind situation reached its first peak on December 4, 1954, when the federal territory was crossed by the storm field of a rapidly moving hurricane low passing over the German Bight and Jutland towards Scandinavia. It reached its final peak between December 19 and 24. On December 23 in particular, when the second hurricane low with a core pressure of less than 955 hectopascals moved southeast from Jutland towards Bornholm, wind speeds estimated at 180 km/h at the time were observed over the German Bight in the sea area near Borkum. The development of the second hurricane low was very similar to that of the Holland storm surge in 1953 and the Capella hurricane in 1976. Similar to the two aforementioned hurricanes, a trough formation occurred on the rear side of the second hurricane low on December 23, which is a drop in air pressure observed in aging cyclones. This led to a redirection and thus to the development of the very severe storm surge in both the Capella hurricane in 1976 and the Holland storm surge, as the passage of the trough in these two cases coincided with high tide. However, on December 23, 1954, the redirection of the track occurred at a more favorable time: no extreme storm surge could develop because the storm subsided significantly during the rising storm tide. A situation like that on January 3, 1976, would have meant a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in 1954, given the very poor condition of coastal protection structures and the much too low dikes along the entire German North Sea coast at the time."

The forecasts for December 23 indicated an expected maximum water level of 999 cm P.N. or 499 cm NN for Cuxhaven. Thus, water levels at the Cuxhaven gauge would have been expected to approximately match the levels reached during the February storm surge of 1962 and the Capella hurricane of 1976. The storm surge of December 23/24, 1954, encountered a largely undeveloped and completely outdated dike system. During the war and hardship years from 1914 to the early 1950s, dike maintenance was marked by severe material shortages, labor shortages, and more, so that many dike sections not only had insufficient height but were also in poor maintenance condition. It was only due to favorable circumstances that Germany did not experience a flood disaster like the one in the Netherlands and Belgium in 1953 during Christmas 1954. In 1954, nine years after the end of World War II, German authorities had no army units available to support rescue and security measures. Civil defense was also not yet developed enough to be capable of handling such a disaster."

Traffic on the Hude–Blexen railway line came to a standstill because the railway facilities in Elsfleth, Nordenham, and Blexen, as well as the Lemwerder station on the Delmenhorst–Lemwerder railway line, were flooded. In the port areas, which at the time were not yet protected by flood walls and flood gates, severe damage occurred in some cases because the water could enter storage sheds almost unhindered. Along the river courses of the Hunte, Lesum, Hamme, Wümme, and Ochtum, the storm surge penetrated far into the hinterland. Parts of Bremen-Huchting were also flooded. Here, as in other residential areas not protected by main dikes, the situation became so dangerous that the small garden areas inhabited by bombed-out residents at Wardamm, in Surfeld, on Stadtwerder, as well as on Rablinghauser and Woltmerhauser Groden, had to be partially evacuated. In the area of the municipality of Hasbergen, which today belongs to Delmenhorst, several hundred hectares of land were flooded. The farmsteads located on mounds could only be reached by boat until after Christmas 1954. The situation became critical at the Ritterhude lock on the Hamme. To prevent a breach of the connecting dike to the lock, the responsible authorities had the lock opened, as neither the lock nor the connecting dike had sufficient height to withstand the storm surge. However, the very high flow velocities occurring in the lock chamber during the storm surge led to scouring and severe damage to the hydraulic structure."

In many places, the water reached the crest of the dikes, which were far too low. In Hamburg, low-lying districts in the city center, such as Baumwall, were flooded; severe damage occurred in the harbor area, which at that time was not yet protected by flood gates and flood walls.

On Nordstrandischmoor, all the walls of the parsonage were pushed in, and the church was devastated; the pulpit, altar, confessional, and all the seating were washed away. All houses were damaged, and three were swept into the sea. The Hallig Hooge was flooded, and the water carried away four houses, with the remaining houses almost completely ruined. Nordmarsch was partially flooded by the high tide. Two hours later, the houses on the mounds were struck by water, and seven of them were swept away. A woman and her two small children drowned. The church on Langeneß was damaged, and the churchyard was so severely devastated that many corpses were washed out of their graves and carried away. Additionally, seven cows and 39 sheep drowned. On Oland, almost all houses were damaged. All polders in the Duchy of Schleswig were flooded, except for the two Christian-Albrechts polders in the Tondern district. Südermarsch was struck by water, and the Porrenkoog was completely submerged. In Husum, the water rose higher than during the floods of 1717 and 1718; bridges were destroyed, and water remained in the houses for days. At the Eddelaker Brack in Dithmarschen, the water swept away some nearby houses, resulting in the loss of several lives. At Kudensee, a new brack formed, 50 to 100 feet wide and 16 feet deep. It was assumed that the water this time stood almost a foot higher than during the floods of 1717 and 1718. In the villages of Aebtissinwisch and Seedorf, the water rose almost two feet higher than during the 1718 flood, causing even more damage. A three-acre piece of high moor nearby, which had already suffered greatly during the previous flood, was torn away, rendering the lands of two neighboring farms unusable. The Elbe dike from Sankt Margarethen to Wewelsfleth was severely damaged and almost completely torn apart, causing the floodwaters to pour over it at a height of more than a ton. The houses on the dike in Brokdorf were partially washed away or heavily damaged. The water flowed into the Gujer marsh and then over the Ohlenburgsfühldeich, where a ground breach occurred, flooding the Beckmünder land and Brockmoor entirely. On the other side of the Stör, Heiligenstedtenerkamp, Hochdorper, and Barenflether land were partially flooded. At Heiligenstedten, the flood ran through all the houses on the dike, and in the new poorhouse, the water stood over a foot high. The Wilsterau overflowed, and the villages of Moorhusen and Neuendorf-Sachsenbande were submerged under four to five feet of water. In the Wilstermarsch, this flood also surpassed the floods of previous years in extent and height. The Wilstermarsch was turned into a lake by the flood, with five people drowning and much livestock lost. The island of Helgoland was separated from the Düne due to the storm surge when the stone wall, the land connection, was flooded and eroded. Some houses on the foreland were swept into the sea. In East Frisia, the dikes were relocated further inland due to a lack of earth, and the villages of Bettewehr II and the submerged Itzendorf from 1717 were de-diked and abandoned."

                "content": "The storm surge of January 21, 1976, marked the end of a west wind weather pattern that had persisted since December 1975. The peak of this weather pattern was the Capella storm of January 3, 1976. The starting point for the development of the weather situation leading to the storm surge was the western Atlantic off the American East Coast and Greenland. Here, on January 19, 1976, subtropical warm air advanced far to the north. At the same time, very cold polar air from the Greenland/North Canada region moved southward to the west. Under these conditions, a low-pressure system formed, which deepened rapidly and moved slowly from the Iceland region over the European North Sea to southern Sweden. On the backside of the storm low, the Azores High intensified, resulting in a very strong northwesterly flow that allowed the polar cold air ready on the backside to advance into Central Europe. A very sharp air pressure gradient developed in the process. Due to its spatial size and low movement speed, the low-pressure system was able to form a very large storm field, which on January 20, 1976, extended from southern Greenland into the German Bight. This meant that a very severe storm surge had to be expected along the German North Sea coast, even though the peak wind speeds in the German Bight were far from reaching the levels of the Capella storm or the Adolph Bermpohl storm of 1967. The strongest hurricane gusts occurred at low tide, but in some places, such as the Halligen islands off the North Frisian coast, the tide still rose higher than during the devastating storm surge of 1962, in some cases reaching or exceeding the levels of the Capella surge. In Bremerhaven, a water level of 4.91 m above sea level was recorded (only 40 cm below the 1962 record). The Hallig Hooge measured 9.12 m above sea level (2.5 m above mean high tide, only 2 cm below the highest level ever recorded). In Havneby on Rømø, for example, the tide was higher than during the first January event (and also the fourth-highest event since 1825). A month later, on February 23, there was another severe but significantly lower storm surge (Büsum NN+4.04 m)."

                "content": "The damage remained comparatively minor because many dikes along the North Sea coast had been reinforced after 1962. On Sylt, for example, where the water level was similarly high as in 1962, the new dikes held only with additional sandbag reinforcements. In some places, dikes that had been hastily repaired after the first January event broke again. In the evening at 7:30 PM, a water level of 4.50 meters above normal high tide was forecast for the Halligen. Many people had spent days clearing mud from their homes and now had to leave their houses again when the disaster management team in Husum declared a full alert at 12:30 AM. Although the water along the coast did not rise as high as feared, it was higher on some Halligen than on January 3. Many of the Halligen were flooded again. On Amrum and Föhr, water levels were measured 20 centimeters higher than 17 days earlier. New significant damage occurred on Amrum. Land erosion took place on the southern beach of Wyk on Föhr, but the Wyk seawall and the pre-fillings proved effective as on January 3. Near Steenodde, ten houses were at risk due to an impending dune breach, which ultimately did not occur. Although the water level in Husum was 78 centimeters lower than on January 3 and 33 centimeters lower than in 1962, the disaster management team ordered the evacuation of Grothusenkoog in Eiderstedt. However, its 25 residents refused to leave and chose to stay with their livestock. Near Westerhever, three firefighters were in danger; they were blown off the dike into the water by the storm but managed to save themselves. On Sylt, four meters of the cliff were torn away near List, and the beach hall was now only 30 meters from the edge of the cliff. At the Hörnum gauge, water levels were higher than on January 3, and there were again significant dangers for the border area north of the Hindenburg Dam. In Denmark, the new Friedrichskoog near Højer Sogn and the Rutebüllkoog were evacuated, over 500 sick and elderly people were brought to safety from Tønder, and evacuation was again ordered for the 7,500 residents. As a precaution, a long train was ready at the station. In the Haseldorfer Marsch, at the northern edge of the Elbe estuary, the dikes destroyed between Holm and Hetlingen during the first January flood were not fully closed until January 20. Due to the expected water masses, the situation became dramatically tense again on the night of January 20 to 21. Surge heights of 4 to 4.50 meters above mean high tide were expected. Around 6 PM, soldiers formed a sandbag chain and reinforced the inner slopes of the broken dike sections. Starting at 8 PM on January 20, precautionary evacuation began in the Haseldorfer Marsch. By 1 AM, all lower-lying farms had been cleared of people and livestock. Due to flood warnings from Cuxhaven, disaster alarms were triggered at 2:30 AM. By 4 AM, the evacuation buses provided by the Bundeswehr and police vehicles were withdrawn from the marsh to avoid being trapped in the event of another flood. At 6 AM, the water masses reached a height of 3.87 meters above MTHW, but the patched dikes withstood the water masses, and an all-clear could be given. In the Kehdinger Land near Dornbusch in the Lower Saxony Elbe region, a section of the dike that had been only hastily repaired after the first January flood broke. This led to further significant flooding in the inland area. However, the consequences here were limited. For the storage facilities in the Hamburg port area and the adjacent areas where dikes had broken on January 3, this storm surge had particularly severe effects. Due to immediate construction measures, most dike breaches had been closed or hastily patched, but industrial and storage halls in Hamburg and other adjacent areas were again flooded meters high."

Bernd Rieken pointed out in 2005 that, for example, Die Welt and the Süddeutsche Zeitung, both on January 22, largely limited their reporting to the front page of an issue.[16] The author places this in the context that the first flood in 1976 was already seen as a success experience of the \"feasibility\" mentality of the 1970s – while during the 1962 event, \"civilization-critical tones\"[16] could still be found, including the quote of the \"finger of God\" – and notes that \"it therefore need not be surprising that [… it] only elicited a minor response in the national press.\"[16]"

Residents quickly became concerned about rising water levels, and on January 5 at 4 a.m., a breach in the Waaldijk at Brakel caused significant damage. The house of the lord of Poederoijen served as a refuge. The villages of Nederhemert, Well, Ammerzoden, Hedel, Rossum, and Gameren are well situated along the dikes, but many houses had already been built in the polders below the villages and were flooded. The villages of Bruchem and Kerkwijk suffered greatly from the flood. The choir of the large Reformed church in Kerkwijk was completely submerged."

A significant ice dam formed in the Pannerdensch Canal due to drifting ice, leading to an increased flow of water and ice floes through the Waal. An ice dam had already formed near Ochten on January 31, but it gave way under the pressure of the water. At a narrowing near Varik, the ice got stuck again. This time, the ice did not move again, and the water began to rise. In several places, the water flowed over the dikes until it broke through the Waalbandijk near present-day Beneden-Leeuwen on February 1. In the subsequent flooding, 37 people drowned, all residents of Leeuwen. The victims were people who lived just behind the dike or had sought protection on the dike behind an emergency dike. The breach caused the entire Land of Maas and Waal to flood. It took until May for most of the water to recede. The water in the Waal was so high that it eventually flowed over the dike near Alphen into the Maas."

The many dike breaches and floods caused enormous damage and claimed the lives of hundreds of people. The volume of water discharge is estimated at 3,600 m³/s, more than 15 times the average discharge of the Meuse. In Huy, the high water destroyed factories, mills, and 200 houses, and between 65 and 80 people lost their lives. The Cistercian abbey of Val-Benoît near Liège flooded, and in the city itself, the Outremeuse district was completely submerged. On January 15, 1643, the Pont des Arches collapsed, causing the Saint Paul's Church to flood due to the surge. The water rose in the church, which at the time was located on an island in the Meuse, to a height of 1.35 meters. A plaque with a chronogram was placed in the church: aLtIVs eXpanso fLVMIne DVXIt aqVas (The overflowing river led its waters to this height) indicates the year 1643: L (50) + I (1) + V (5) + X (10) + L (50) + V (5) + M (1000) + I (1) + D (500) + V (5) + X (10) + I (1) + V (5) = 1643. In Maastricht, the Meuse reached a height of 47.89 meters above NAP, almost a meter higher than during the major floods of 1926 and 1993. At Meers, the dikes and the old part of the village were washed away. The old castle of Elsloo disappeared forever into the Meuse: the ruins can still be seen during very low water levels. The village of Obbicht was completely washed away on January 15 after a dike breach, possibly resulting in more than 500 deaths. At the time, the village was located further west where the nature reserve Negenoord is now, in present-day Belgium. The Meuse used to bend westward under Obbicht Castle, ran northward between Stokkem and Obbicht, and turned eastward again near Dilsen. In Venlo, the highest water level of 19.50 meters above NAP was reached on January 17, as evidenced by an embedded memorial stone in the city center stating that this level was reached on St. Anthony's Day 1643; the feast day of Anthony of Egypt is January 17. 838 · 1014 · 1042 · 1134 · 1163 · 1164 · 1170 · 1196 · 1212 · 1214 · 1219 · 1220 · 1221 · 1248/1249 · 1277 · 1280 · 1282 · 1287 · 1288 (I) · 1288 (II) · 1322 · 1334 · 1362 · 1374 · 1375 · 1377 · 1404 · 1421 · 1424 · 1468 · 1477 · 1509 · 1514 · 1530 · 1532 · 1552 · 1566 · 1570 · 1610 · 1643 · 1651 · 1675 · 1682 · 1686 · 1703 · 1717 · 1726 · 1741 · 1775 · 1776 · 1784 · 1799 · 1808 · 1809 · 1820 · 1825 · 1855 · 1861 (I) · 1861 (II) · 1877 · 1906 · 1916 · 1926 · 1953 · 1962 · 1993 · 1995 · 2006 · 2021"

                "content": "The persistence of adverse weather phenomena for several days, following which the Civil Protection of the Liguria region had already issued yellow and orange weather alert warnings for the respective basins, led the same body to declare a maximum alert level (red alert) for the entire day of Monday, October 29, 2018, for basins B, C, D, and E, corresponding to the Genoese Riviera, part of the western Riviera, the central inland area of the region, and the entire eastern Riviera. For basin A, which includes the stretch of the western Riviera between Ventimiglia and Noli, the entire province of Imperia, and the Centa Valley, the alert remained at yellow and orange levels. In the preceding days, violent torrential rain affected almost the entire Ligurian territory, with significant short-term water accumulations recorded—especially in the Genoese hinterland (upper Scrivia Valley, Trebbia Valley, and Bisagno Valley), Chiavari area (Aveto Valley, Fontanabuona Valley, and Sturla Valley), and the La Spezia area (Cinque Terre and Vara Valley)—and the presence of landslides, mudslides, and flooding in various municipalities. In addition to the intense rainfall, another source of danger was the strong gusts of wind (in some measurements in the eastern Liguria exceeding 100-120 km/h and, in the west, up to 180 km/h, as recorded by sensors at the Loano Marina) and the resulting storm surges, which, fueled by the wind's force, affected the entire Ligurian coastline, especially in the Savona, Genoa, and Tigullio areas. The wind was the cause of the death of the only victim of the bad weather: an 88-year-old woman from Albisola Superiore, struck by parts of a roof and cornice blown into the street by the violent and sudden atmospheric phenomenon, who later died at the Savona hospital from the severe injuries sustained. The combined action of the wind gusts and the sea's wave motion caused the most significant damage on October 29 and 30, both in the public and private sectors, during the entire emergency phase of the meteorological event. Violent waves, some as high as 7-10 meters (the maximum height, measured by instruments at the Capo Mele buoy in the Savona area, was 10.31 meters), violently struck the Savona and Genoa coasts, causing the near-total destruction of existing beach facilities (structures, outdoor areas, piers) and the erasure of entire stretches of sandy and pebbly beaches. An initial assessment by the local Italian beach operators' union, in the hours following the storm surge on October 29, estimated that out of approximately 1,300 equipped Ligurian beach establishments, about 100 were completely destroyed, and about 400 were seriously damaged, with damages amounting to at least 50 million euros. In the municipality of Genoa, in addition to monitoring the main Bisagno and Polcevera streams (the latter being a special focus following the collapse of the Morandi Bridge just over two months earlier), the violent storm surge caused damage along the entire Genoese coastline, from Voltri to Nervi. There were collapses of some sections of the Anita Garibaldi promenade in Nervi and devastation in the fishing village of Boccadasse and the private and public infrastructure of the Sturla, Pegli, and Voltri districts, with damages estimated at around 8 million euros. The sea's force also struck port infrastructure: particularly affected were the public port of Santa Margherita Ligure and the international tourist port \"Carlo Riva\" in Rapallo, with the collapse of their respective breakwaters. The sudden collapse of some sections of the containment walls caused subsequent vulnerability of the ports themselves, as well as the coastal stretches of the two cities in western Tigullio, with flooding and damage to seafronts and commercial activities located there. In Santa Margherita Ligure, after the collapse of about 10 meters of the breakwater in a section renovated and reinforced with work completed in 2014, damages were recorded to port services and the local Coast Guard barracks, the sinking of boats, and flooding of the main road along the marina. Towards Portofino, the fury of the sea caused the complete collapse of a section of the provincial road 227 near the Paraggi hamlet and severe damage to the structure of the famous nightclub Covo di Nord-Est. The road's collapse isolated Portofino from Santa Margherita Ligure by road—the SP 227 being the only drivable artery serving Portofino—making the municipality accessible only by sea, with the help of boats and vessels, or by land via trails and forest paths on the namesake promontory. To address the emergency situation, the Portofino Park Authority and the administrations of Portofino and Santa Margherita Ligure authorized the semi-drivable adaptation (for two-wheeled vehicles and emergency vehicles) of some pedestrian forest paths, particularly the section between Portofino Vetta and Portofino Mare and between the Nozarego hamlet of Santa Margherita and the Gassetta Mill (known as the Gave trail). This intervention, for some techniques considered too cementitious, was later contested by some environmental associations, followed by actual checks by the forest police; at the end of November of the same year, work on the trail was halted by the park authority, also for the adaptation of the other path towards Portofino. On the provincial road section between Santa Margherita Ligure and Paraggi, however, a temporary cantilevered pedestrian walkway was built between late November and early December 2018, initially used exclusively by local residents and later, during the Christmas period, opened to all pedestrians. Among the damages recorded in Portofino, besides the collapse of part of the central and famous \"piazzetta\" and the problems in connections with the centers of Santa Margherita Ligure, Rapallo, and the Golfo Paradiso, there was an interruption of electricity and gas services in the days following the event. In nearby Rapallo, on the night between October 29 and 30, the collapse of the breakwater, reinforced and expanded during the 2000s after a similar but less violent atmospheric phenomenon, caused major damage, with the sinking of numerous boats in the area between the public and private ports and, with the breaking of various moorings, the escape of hundreds of boats and yachts from the \"Carlo Riva\" port, which, adrift and at the mercy of the sea's wave motion, sank in the Rapallo Gulf or ran aground on the Vittorio Veneto seafront embankment and other areas to the west (Lido area and Boate stream mouth) and east of the city (San Francesco stream mouth area, near the local sea castle, and Nagge area). On the same night, 20 boaters present inside the marina and trapped in their boats due to the sea's fury were rescued by fire brigade teams. The grounding of the boats, some of considerable size and owned by prominent individuals, indirectly caused a massive media phenomenon due to the event's exceptional nature and scale, with footage and television reports from various national and international broadcasters. Due to the stranded boats, the city suffered damage to several private accommodation facilities along the seafront (damaged in several places) and especially to beach establishments, with the semi-destruction of fixed structures and piers. Along the seafront, there were several problems related to environmental factors, such as the possible fuel leakage from various boats (for these reasons, anti-pollution cloths were quickly installed around the boats); a huge amount of plastic, wood, and mixed waste was carried by the waves and scattered along the entire coastline, even completely clogging the stormwater drains. Compared to nearby Santa Margherita Ligure, which suffered more damage to public assets, the Rapallo area experienced the most damage in the private sector, with the international tourist port \"Carlo Riva\" being the primary victim. The port infrastructure, built in the 1970s and the first private tourist port in Italy, estimated damages to the structure at 10-15 million euros, and in November, a judicial investigation was opened by the Genoa Prosecutor's Office to determine and ascertain any responsibilities. A similar case file was opened by the Genoese judiciary for the events related to the collapse of the breakwater of the public port in Santa Margherita. In total, about 300 boats, yachts, and vessels were damaged; as of November 15, about 130 had been removed, with complex and delicate operations on the seafront and marina. Within the Rapallo municipal territory, severe damage was also recorded in the marine hamlet of San Michele di Pagana, with the destruction of local beach establishments and various commercial and dining activities, damage to stretches of beach and cliffs, the collapse of the pier in front of the square, the collapse of a section of the coastal road to Rapallo near the Arches Beach, and the collapse of various portions of the retaining walls of the land overlooking the sea and the coastal walkway connecting to the small inhabited area of Prelo. Towards the east, further storm surge damage was recorded in Zoagli, with the collapse of some sections of the cliff (both the eastern and western ones) and damage to commercial activities, and again in the eastern Tigullio area, with similar but less severe issues in Chiavari, Lavagna, Cavi di Lavagna, Sestri Levante, and Riva Trigoso. In the La Spezia Riviera, the damage caused by wind and storm surges was recorded in Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Riomaggiore, Portovenere, and the provincial capital itself. In the Western Riviera, the atmospheric phenomena affected the municipalities of Arenzano, Cogoleto, Celle Ligure, Albisola Marina, Savona, Bergeggi, Alassio, Finale Ligure, and other locations along the Savona coast. A similar situation also occurred in the province of Imperia, with damages recorded in the capital and Sanremo."

                "content": "The exceptional nature of the atmospheric event, especially due to the vastness of the affected area, inevitably caused significant monetary damage across all economic sectors and infrastructures, both public and private. An approximate calculation, revised multiple times by the various affected territories, led to an estimate of damages by the Genoa Chamber of Commerce exceeding 100,000,000 euros in the municipalities of the Genoa province alone: 477 reports were filed by businesses and activities in 25 municipalities of the Genoa metropolitan city, of which 117 were in Genoa itself (damages of about 33,400,000 euros), 73 in Rapallo (about 23,500,000 euros), and 61 in Santa Margherita Ligure (about 23,300,000 euros). In the Imperia area, the estimate was about 18,000,000 euros for the municipality of Imperia alone. In the province of Savona, the assessment mainly concerned damage to various beach establishments, with a total exceeding 30,000,000 euros, including volumetric and commercial value lost and necessary for restarting. To address the initial critical issues, in January 2019, the National Department of Civil Protection allocated 6,500,000 euros for initial emergency interventions, of which 2,700,000 euros were to cover expenses incurred by municipal entities for assistance interventions and the remaining 4,700,000 euros for the restoration and adjustment of roadways. Specifically, 57 municipalities were involved in the funding allocation: 21 in the province of Savona, 15 in the province of Genoa, 14 in the province of La Spezia, and 7 in the province of Imperia. This amount was supplemented by an allocation of about 1,500,000 euros from the Liguria Region and an additional 8,000,000 euros allocated by the Stability Law for coastal defenses in Liguria."

Almost the entire La Muela mountain range, the entire Cerezo mountain range, and the mountains located between it and the sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza in Calasparra, on the banks of the Segura River, were mainly burned, with the Hondares mountain range being spared. Investigations pointed to an electrical failure caused by the contact of a pine tree with the power lines, producing a spark, as maintenance work had been carried out on the area's wiring in previous days. The first signs of fire were calls from Moratalla residents around 10:30 in the morning on July 4, alerting about smoke coming from the mountain range. At its peak, the fire reached several fronts in Moratalla, Benizar, Camping La Puerta (which was evacuated), Calasparra, the Sotos and Bosque de la ribera de Cañaverosa natural reserve, and Cieza, covering a total of 90 km. Among other reasons, because it did not reach large population centers, there were no fatalities. It is currently considered the worst fire recorded in the Region of Murcia and one of the most significant in Spain."

This site on the right bank of the Segura River was not affected in its garden area or the sanctuary itself, but it was on the left bank of the river and throughout the surrounding area, with very old specimens of hackberry (Celtis australis) on the right bank also burning but regrowing. The entire riparian forest area around the sanctuary is, twenty years later, in a state of conservation even better than in 1994 due to the intervention with the planting of native species on the right bank of the river."

The fire did not claim any lives but became one of the largest forest fires in the country in recent times. The forest fire covered an area of more than 1,000 hectares, of which about 740 hectares were forest lands. As a result of the fire, the largest rescue operation in modern Gotland history was carried out."

On this day, there was also a fresh southern wind of about 15 m/s. The fire started in the forest on the southern part of the ancient Torsburgen castle, a few hundred meters north of Ardre Luka. The fire quickly spread and soon became a crown fire, and due to the wind, a fire tornado with a two-kilometer front formed, advancing north towards the Heideby farm and the Kräklingbo church. The fire was fought on three fronts. Two flanks, each six kilometers long, were slowly spreading outward, and a 2.5-kilometer-wide front in the north was spreading very quickly."

By this time, around a hundred firefighters, 60 conscripts from the Visby garrison, and several volunteers were at the scene. A rescue center was established at the fire station in Kräklingbo. A Q-90 helicopter from Visby and a Q-4 helicopter were deployed to fight the fire from the air. Later, an additional Q-97 helicopter with a blocked crew was deployed. Finally, a Q-91 helicopter also participated. During the fire, these helicopters flew a total of almost 44 hours. A total of 414 barrels of water, approximately 800 cubic meters, were dropped. Throughout the day, the fire came closer to three farms in Hejdeby, and emergency services prepared to evacuate all residents of the area. Chaos reigned on the farms, and many people did not know what to do. Nisse Olofsson, a former fire station chief in Kräklingbo, along with 20 other people, took on the task of fighting the fire in Hejdeby. They managed to set a counterfire, and when the fire was just 10 meters away from Thor's farm, they succeeded in stopping it. The flames then rose 30 meters into the air. By the evening of July 11, firebreaks around the area were secured, but the fire was still burning intensely inside. On the morning broadcast of July 13, local radio announced: \"The rescue service management asks us to announce that all firefighters and fire protection staff on leave should report to the Visby station as soon as possible.\" Shortly afterward, it was announced that the worst danger seemed to have passed. On the night and morning of July 13, light rain fell on Gotland, which helped extinguish the fire. During the night, an intensive firefighting operation was conducted in Thorsburgen itself, hoping to prevent the fire from spreading further in the area. However, personnel had to be withdrawn from the area due to falling trees. About fifty firefighters guarded the southern part of the site, and it was now considered that the fire was fully under control."

In Torsburgen itself, almost the entire forest in the central and northern parts was damaged by the fire. It took a month before rescue services could declare the operation complete. The total cost of the rescue operation is estimated at approximately 18.5 million Swedish kronor. The armed forces supported the rescue operation by providing 400 military personnel, communication equipment, helicopters, and vehicles. However, the forest fire of 1992 was not the first in Torsburgen. When Carl Linnaeus visited Torsburgen in the summer of 1741, he noted that the plateau was almost completely devoid of forest, \"for fire had long since consumed it.\" The fire Linnaeus refers to is likely a large forest fire that devastated significant parts of the parishes of Alskog, Ala, Ardre, and Kräklingbo in the summer of 1655. In the spring of 1993, the Swedish Forest Agency made several attempts on plots below the plateau, the so-called cage, to plant birch, pine, Austrian black pine, and larch. Black pine was chosen partly because it is more tolerant of high lime levels, and the long needles of this tree provide a lot of sparse growth."

The fire was extinguished approximately 24 hours later, and although it did not spread to residential areas, it claimed the lives of 18 people, making it one of the worst forest fires in the postwar period [Note 1].

                "content": "At 11:10 a.m. on April 27, 1971, a fire broke out in the privately-owned forest of Obariyama near the Kado-no-Kuchi irrigation pond in Hirocho, Kure City. The cause of the fire was a bonfire used for boiling water at a construction site by workers engaged in disaster recovery work on the waterway. The fire was fanned by the wind, spread to nearby dry grass, and quickly expanded. On that day, the weather was clear and dry, and a fire warning had been issued since the previous day. Additionally, there were adverse conditions with strong winds blowing from the east-southeast at an average of 5 meters per second and a maximum of 14 meters per second, causing the fire to rapidly engulf the forest.\n\nAt 11:18 a.m. on the same day, the Kure City Fire Department's East Fire Station received a report of the fire, and 16 firefighters rushed to the scene to begin firefighting efforts. However, the scale of the fire gradually expanded, prompting the dispatch of reinforcements, including 109 fire engines, 84 Kure City Fire Department personnel, and over 400 volunteer firefighters to the disaster site. Additionally, the fire department contacted the mayor of Kure City and the governor of Hiroshima Prefecture, requesting the deployment of the Self-Defense Forces. Ultimately, more than 1,900 personnel, including Kure City Fire Department staff, Hiroshima City Fire Department staff, Ground Self-Defense Force members, Maritime Self-Defense Force members, Forestry Bureau staff, and local volunteer firefighters, were involved in the firefighting efforts.\n\nThe fire's intensity did not subside easily and continued to burn for over 24 hours. By around 11 a.m. on the following day, April 28, the fire was extinguished with the help of rainfall. As a result, 115 hectares of national forest, 85 hectares of municipal forest, and 140 hectares of private forest, totaling 340 hectares, were burned. Fortunately, the fire did not spread to urban areas or residential houses. However, the unexpected situation led to a major tragedy, with 18 firefighters who were engaged in firefighting efforts being caught in the fire and losing their lives."

                "content": "As previously mentioned, the fire in which as many as 18 firefighters perished by burning to death was unprecedented [Note 2], and it was a tragedy that occurred during firefighting operations. The sequence of events is as follows. \n\nThe East First Squad had been dispatched ahead to extinguish the forest fire, but the East Fire Department Chief sent the second squad, which was dispatched later, to the scene first. This second squad descended the ridge of the northern peak and entered the valley to prevent the fire from spreading eastward. However, due to strong winds blowing from the east-southeast that day, around 2:30 PM, the flames spread to fallow farmland, intensifying the fire. The first squad observed this and instructed the second squad to retreat, but by then, there was no response from the squad leader. By that time, the intensified flames were racing down the steep slope, and the entire valley was already engulfed in thick smoke. \n\nIn response to this situation, the first squad immediately conducted rescue operations, but by 4:02 PM, the bodies of 13 firefighters were confirmed, and by 5:02 PM, the bodies of an additional 4 firefighters were found, totaling 17 fatalities. At 4:19 PM, one severely injured individual was rescued, but they succumbed to burns and passed away at the hospital on May 1. \n\nThe cause of such an accident was attributed to the flames spreading at an unexpectedly rapid pace down the steep slope, leaving the firefighters with no escape route. To investigate this, researchers from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency visited the site and compared it with three similar forest fire cases that had occurred in the United States. They demonstrated the dangers of firefighting on steep slopes. As a result, it was determined that the phenomenon known as \"flare-up\" [Note 3] was responsible. \n\nAdditionally, the decision by the first squad to send the second squad to the east side, downwind, despite the strong east-southeast winds, was criticized as a misjudgment. The issue of potentially underestimating the unique and localized meteorological conditions was raised, referencing past incidents such as the Iwanai Great Fire during the Toyamaru Typhoon in 1954 (Showa 29). This highlighted the necessity of considering the specific meteorological conditions of a region or district in future firefighting operations, leading to the installation of anemometers and hygrometers in mountainous areas nationwide. \n\nAt the time, firefighting techniques for forest fires, such as aerial firefighting, were underdeveloped, and only one civilian helicopter was used for aerial firefighting in this incident. It was pointed out that \"if aerial firefighting using helicopters and airplanes, as in the United States, had been the main method, such a tragedy might have been avoided.\" This led to calls for the enhancement of firefighting techniques and equipment for forest fires and the development of new firefighting agents. Particularly, as a lesson from this fire, firefighting helicopters began to be utilized in large-scale forest fires thereafter."

Having started east of Lake Stensjön, it quickly spread westward, crossing the Stensjön and Lanan lakes. By the evening of the same day, more than 200 hectares were engulfed in flames. The fire was very difficult to control, partly due to the challenges firefighters faced in accessing the heart of the park. More than 500 firefighters and twelve helicopters were needed to bring the fire under control. The fire was declared extinguished after a week. The toll was 450 hectares burned, including pines over 400 years old. Nine months later, the park was reopened to the public. The area affected by the fire was profoundly altered; where centuries-old trees once grew, there is now a charred and barren landscape, dominated by newly exposed rock."

Although it was harmful to certain species, such as the capercaillie, others benefited from the fire, such as Melanophila acuminata. Furthermore, a few new species were discovered following the fire, such as Tritozyga tyrestaenensis. The fire, having destroyed the thick layer of peat covering the ground, also provided an excellent opportunity for archaeologists to explore the region. In 2000, an archaeological study succeeded in identifying more than 120 sites, most of which date back to the Stone Age. Quartz fragments, probably used for making weapons and tools, were particularly found."

The mountains form a ridgeline running from northwest to southeast. The slopes of these mountains are steep, ranging from 20 to 40 degrees, and the narrow coastal plains house residential areas and ports (such as Koyo Port). Additionally, along Etajima Bay in the southwest of the island, there are facilities related to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (such as the Target Drone Maintenance Unit, the Officer Candidate School, and the First Technical School of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force). Due to the geographical factors of these steeply sloped mountains, fire-fighting water sources such as rivers and reservoirs were almost nonexistent in the event of large-scale fires. The bedrock at the fire site consists of granite (biotite granite) from the Mesozoic Cretaceous period, and the soil is weathered into gravel or sand-like material, known as \"masa\" soil. The burned vegetation, or the vegetation at the time, was dominated by compensatory vegetation, as barren mountains were prominent due to the poor soil on these steep slopes. As part of forest conservation projects, red pine and broad-leaved forests were planted."

Due to the strong north foehn, the fire spread quickly. According to the Ticino cantonal police, it involved six hectares of forest. Firefighters from Gambarogno and Bellinzona, three helicopters, and a Super Puma from the Swiss Army helped to reach the difficult-to-access area. On January 30, 45 people from the village of Indemini and 13 people from the hamlets of Ri, Pezze, and Boè were evacuated from their homes. For safety reasons, the border crossing to Italy at Indemini and the cantonal road passing through the wildfire area were closed. Support came from Italy. On January 13, 2022, Swiss authorities had imposed a ban on outdoor fires due to the drought. The firefighting efforts had to be interrupted during the night of February 1, 2022, due to darkness. However, the ten-member ground team remained on-site in subzero temperatures. In the following days, additional teams with a total of six helicopters were deployed. By February 9, 2022, 200 hectares of forest had burned. Due to the strong wind, the firefighting helicopters could only be used to a limited extent. On February 11, 2022, the firefighting efforts were concluded."

A 26-year-old and a 28-year-old man were arrested and interrogated. They are accused of negligently causing a conflagration. According to the public prosecutor's office, the two wild campers had neither adhered to the fire ban nor followed the usual precautions when handling fire. They also failed to extinguish the fire properly.[7][8] On February 9, 2022, Ticino television reported that the suspects had called the Ticino fire department. The two did not know the phone number of the Ticino fire department, searched for it on Google, and ended up contacting the volunteer fire department in Tessin on the Baltic Sea in northern Germany. When they realized their mistake, they hung up and did not call again. As reported by Radiotelevisione Svizzera, they later cooperated with the authorities and expressed their regret over the forest fire.[4][5] According to the police, the suspects are no longer in custody.[6]"

Several trees were also damaged during an ice storm, which increased the available fuel by adding dead wood to the layer of dried leaves. The absence of heavy rains subsequently maintained and worsened the problem."

A second detachment of 120 firefighters and rescue firefighters took over on June 28 before being replaced by a detachment of the same size on July 19. This last detachment included technicians responsible for deploying the Fenics telecommunications module. The efforts of these various detachments were concentrated around Pascagama, Windfall, and Chibougamau. To ensure coordination with local firefighters, a liaison officer worked within SOPFEU's command post and another in Winnipeg at the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. On August 10, 2023, the mission of the last French detachment ended.

                "content": "On July 17, 2024, authorities issued a fire hazard warning for southwestern Slovenia. On July 18, around 10 a.m., fires broke out in two locations on the slopes of Trstelj (643 m above sea level) and Kančnik on the Karst Plateau. By 10:30, 45 firefighting units were on the scene. At 10:34, the commander of the Slovenian Civil Protection, Srečko Šestan, activated the national protection and rescue plan. The first aerial water drop occurred approximately half an hour after the fire was reported. At 1:00 p.m., the relevant authorities organized a press conference. During the firefighting efforts, 60 hectares of forest were cleared as an emergency measure. The fire initially threatened communication infrastructure at the top of Trstelj and the Stjenkova mountain hut below the summit, coming within 100 meters, but firefighters managed to protect the infrastructure. No settlements were endangered by the fire. Around 100 members of the Slovenian army also intervened at the scene, providing, among other things, food supplies. Civil protection was activated, with a headquarters set up in Lipa. During the fire, municipal authorities of the Municipality of Renče - Vogrsko advised against outdoor activities due to high smoke and heat exposure. The police issued a similar advisory for the wider region and also banned drone flights. Several roads in the broader Karst area were closed due to firefighting interventions. There were no evacuations of people in the area, but firefighters evacuated a flock of sheep on Trstelj. The international power line Sredipolje–Divača was disconnected. Rumors surfaced that the fire was deliberately set, and the police investigated these claims. Unlike the 2022 Karst fire, this fire affected an area less dangerous due to unexploded ordnance, but around 3 p.m., a 75-mm shell from World War I exploded near firefighters, with two more shells exploding during the night. Initial estimates suggested the fire affected around 150 hectares of forest, but this estimate was later revised. Aerial and helicopter units collectively dropped 155,000 liters of water on the fire, flying until 6 p.m., while 3,700 m³ of water was also pumped from the water supply system, according to Simon Vendramin, the intervention leader. By 5:30 p.m., the fire was still not under control. Firefighting planes dropped 3,000 liters of water every 12 minutes, completing a total of 56 runs. The night intervention leader on July 19, 2024, partially handed over fire coordination to foresters from the Forest Service. Mulching and mowing of central grassy strips on roads, as well as the creation of firebreaks, were carried out. By noon, 480 firefighters were on the scene, with a total of 550 protection service members involved. The fire was under control by noon. On July 19, Prime Minister Robert Golob visited the site, highlighting the benefits of purchasing firefighting planes, legislative changes, and upgrading the Karst water supply system. On the night of July 20, rain began to fall, aiding firefighters in containing the fire's edge. Around 350 firefighters were active at the site. On July 20, Srečko Šestan deactivated the protection and rescue plan. A total of 400 firefighters participated in the intervention, supported by helicopters from the Slovenian police and army, as well as two new Air Tractor AT-802 planes, which were deployed for the first time. Firefighting units arriving in the Karst on the morning of July 20 assisted other units in removing firefighting hoses from difficult-to-access terrain. Some units that had planned to arrive on the morning of July 20 had to cancel their intervention due to local storm responses elsewhere in Slovenia. On July 22, 2024, around 8 a.m., another fire broke out but was quickly extinguished. Roads closed due to firefighting interventions were reopened on July 22. Fire patrols were conducted in the broader fire area until July 25. After the fire was extinguished, Agriculture Minister Mateja Čalušić emphasized the need to simplify obtaining landowner consents for implementing further fire prevention measures and establishing recovery plans."

The importance of coordination among the organizations of the National System for Disaster Prevention and Response (SINAPRED) to address the situation was emphasized. On February 8, the Chilean Meteorological Directorate issued a yellow alert for intense heat for several communes in the Coquimbo Region, including La Higuera, Vicuña, Paihuano, Río Hurtado, Monte Patria, Combarbalá, Illapel, and Salamanca. Maximum temperatures were forecasted to reach up to 36°C, increasing the risk of forest fires. Authorities urged the population to take precautionary measures and avoid activities that could generate sparks or fire in vegetated areas. The following day, the national director of the National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response (SENAPRED), Alicia Cebrián, reported that 15 forest fires were being fought nationwide, mainly concentrated in the La Araucanía Region.

On February 7, anticipating temperatures that could reach 40°C over the weekend, the Government of Chile declared a red alert in this region. Additionally, the \"zero activity\" measure was implemented, which involves the suspension of agricultural and forestry activities, as well as the closure of national parks during the month of February, to prevent fire risks. On February 8, SENAPRED ordered the evacuation of the Hacienda San Enrique sector, in the commune of Santo Domingo, due to a forest fire threatening the area.

On February 8, four active forest fires were reported in the communes of Mulchén, Hualqui, Santa Juana, and Tirúa, affecting more than 1,200 hectares. The most critical situation occurred in Mulchén, where the flames consumed approximately 1,200 hectares. Authorities evaluated the possibility of implementing a curfew to facilitate emergency efforts. The regional director of the National Forestry Corporation (Conaf), Esteban Krause, reported 11 fires in the region, highlighting the one in Chumulco in Mulchén, which affected around 1,300 hectares. He also expressed concern about a fire in the Punta de Parra area, in the commune of Tomé. The following day, SENAPRED declared a Red Alert for the Biobío Region due to the simultaneous occurrence of forest fires that directly threaten populated areas and pose a risk to people's lives. This decision was made after the emergence of new fire outbreaks in different parts of the commune of Mulchén. The regional presidential delegate, Eduardo Pacheco, reported that the fires are concentrated in three points of the region: Punta de Parra (commune of Tomé), Chumulco (commune of Mulchén), and La Greda (commune of Penco). It was noted that, so far, no people or homes have been directly affected by the forest fires. On February 14, two fire outbreaks in the forests of the hills of Lebu, the capital of the Arauco province, forced the evacuation of residents in that sector of the commune with sound alerts and notifications to cell phones. On the same day, a red alert was declared for the commune of Los Álamos due to a forest fire in the Araucana Tres Pinos sector that was dangerously approaching populated areas and had consumed 33 hectares of forest.

                "content": "Tropical Cyclone Olga (JTWC designation: 09S, or simply Cyclone Olga) was a tropical cyclone that affected the Solomon Islands and Australia at the end of January 2010. Being the seventh tropical system and the fourth named tropical cyclone of the 2009-2010 Australian region cyclone season and the fourth tropical system of the 2009-2010 South Pacific cyclone season, Olga formed from an area of meteorological disturbances on January 18, with the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji classifying it as tropical depression \"04F.\" Moving west-southwest, the depression left the RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility to enter the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Brisbane, Australia, two days later. On January 22, the system became a significant tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity the following day, with maximum sustained winds of 95 km/h (1-minute sustained), according to the JTWC, or 100 km/h (10-minute sustained), according to the TCWC in Brisbane. From then on, Olga weakened rapidly before ceasing to be a significant tropical cyclone and making landfall in Queensland, Australia, on January 24. After several days over land, Olga became a significant tropical cyclone again on January 29, over the Gulf of Carpentaria, and made landfall on Queensland's west coast on January 30 with winds of up to 65 km/h. Over land again, Olga fully dissipated later that day. As a tropical depression, Olga caused two deaths in the Solomon Islands. In Australia, damages were limited to floods and flash floods, amounting to nearly 90 million dollars in losses."

                "content": "Tropical Cyclone Olga formed from an area of meteorological disturbances east of the Solomon Islands that began to show signs of organization on January 18. As soon as the disturbance showed initial signs of organization, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for monitoring tropical cyclones in the South Pacific Ocean, classified the system as a tropical disturbance, assigning it the designation \"04F.\" Being in a region with reasonably favorable meteorological conditions, with moderate wind shear, areas of deep convection began to form around a broad and poorly defined low-level cyclonic center. Consequently, on January 19, the RSMC in Nadi classified the system as a tropical depression. Moving southwest, the depression left the RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility to enter the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Brisbane, Australia, later that day. As a result, the RSMC in Nadi issued its final advisory on the system. Moving into the Coral Sea, the disturbance remained disorganized due to a slight increase in wind shear. However, even under unfavorable meteorological conditions, the low-level cyclonic circulation center began to consolidate with improved upper-level outflow. Consequently, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), the United States Navy agency responsible for monitoring tropical cyclones, issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system that evening (UTC), indicating that the disturbance could become a significant tropical cyclone within 12 to 24 hours. Shortly thereafter, the TCWC in Brisbane classified the system as a tropical cyclone and named it \"Olga.\" The system continued to organize rapidly, and as the cyclone began to exhibit curved storm bands, the JTWC also classified the system as a significant tropical cyclone early on January 23 (UTC), assigning it the designation \"09P.\" Moving westward along the periphery of a subtropical high to the south, Olga rapidly intensified as wind shear decreased. Consequently, the TCWC in Brisbane classified the system as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale later that afternoon (UTC). However, a sudden increase in wind shear and the cyclone's interaction with the remnants of Cyclone Neville prevented Olga from continuing to intensify. As a result, Olga reached its peak intensity on January 23, with maximum sustained winds of 95 km/h (1-minute sustained) according to the JTWC, or 100 km/h (10-minute sustained) according to the TCWC in Brisbane. From then on, Olga began to weaken as it moved southwestward toward the coast of Queensland, northern Australia. Consequently, the TCWC in Brisbane downgraded Olga to a Category 1 tropical cyclone early on January 24 (UTC). Olga continued to weaken that day, and all of its deep convection areas were removed by strong wind shear. Olga ceased to be a significant tropical cyclone later that morning (UTC), according to the TCWC in Brisbane. Later that day, the JTWC issued its final advisory on the system as weather models no longer predicted significant intensification of Olga before the system reached northeastern Australia. That evening, Olga's remnants made landfall in northeastern Australia and began moving west-northwest with no significant changes. However, two days later, the system began to show signs of reorganization as it approached the Gulf of Carpentaria. Wind shear subsided, and the formation of a mesoscale anticyclone over the system allowed for the establishment of good upper-level outflow. Consequently, the JTWC issued a new TCFA on the system on the afternoon of January 26 (UTC). Hours later, the JTWC resumed issuing regular advisories on Olga as curved storm bands formed around the low-level cyclonic circulation center. However, Olga unexpectedly moved south-southwest over the Northern Territory, moving away from the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over land, Olga began to weaken once again, and the JTWC issued its final advisory on the system on the morning of January 28 (UTC). Once again, forecasts failed, although the initial prediction prevailed; Olga's remnants moved northeastward, and on the morning of January 29 (UTC), the disturbance reached the Gulf of Carpentaria. Due to excellent meteorological conditions at that time, the JTWC issued another TCFA. Over the warm waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the system rapidly intensified, and the JTWC resumed issuing regular advisories on the system later that afternoon. Practically at the same time, the TCWC in Brisbane reclassified the system as a significant tropical cyclone. Moving east and southeast, Olga quickly crossed the Gulf of Carpentaria and made landfall on Queensland's west coast near the town of Burketown around 20:00 (UTC) that day, with winds of up to 65 km/h, according to the JTWC. Once again over land, Olga weakened, and the JTWC issued its final advisory early on January 30 (UTC). Practically at the same time, the TCWC in Brisbane downgraded Olga to a tropical low and also issued its final advisory on the system. Olga completely dissipated over eastern Australia later that day."

Days later, as the system approached the Gulf of Carpentaria coast, new cyclone alerts were issued for communities in the coastal regions of the gulf. The alerts and warnings were extended to almost all coastal regions around the gulf as Olga re-intensified on January 29. Still as a tropical depression, the system caused heavy rains in the Solomon Islands. The floods caused the death of two children from a camp and left one person injured. Another 153 people had to be evacuated from the banks of a river near the capital, Honiara. The rains also damaged some homes and bridges and caused landslides in some isolated regions. Few impacts were reported in association with the effects of Olga's passage over Queensland on January 24. In some locations, Olga's effects were more beneficial than harmful; the region faces a prolonged drought, and accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm in some areas. Mining production in Karumba had to be halted as a precaution against the cyclone's effects in the region, as the port that ships the mined material had to be closed. The important Bruce Highway, which connects Queensland to the rest of the country, had to be closed at the Houghton River bridge; the river's waters overflowed and threatened the bridge's structure. Floods associated with Olga caused damages exceeding 100 million Australian dollars. As a result, the Queensland government had to allocate funds to assist people affected by the cyclone in 38 state councils."

                "content": "The severe tropical cyclone Billy (JTWC designation: 05S; simply known as cyclone Billy) was an intense tropical cyclone that occurred northwest of Australia in mid-December 2008. Being the third tropical cyclone, the second named tropical system, and the first severe tropical cyclone of the 2008-09 Australian region cyclone season, Billy formed from an area of meteorological disturbances on December 15, west of Darwin, Australia. Moving slowly southward and entering the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, the system continued to organize rapidly, and the Darwin Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) classified it as a tropical low on December 17. With highly favorable meteorological conditions, the system continued to organize and intensify, and the Darwin TCWC classified it as a full tropical cyclone the following day, naming it Billy. The cyclone continued to intensify until it made landfall on the Australian coast on December 20, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, with maximum sustained winds of 75 km/h, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Over land, Billy weakened rapidly and downgraded to a tropical low. The system crossed the region for about two days before moving back over the sea on December 22, when it began to intensify again. The Perth TCWC reclassified Billy as a full tropical cyclone later that day. Billy began to intensify rapidly from December 24 as it moved away from the Australian coast, reaching its peak intensity later that afternoon, with maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h, according to the JTWC, or 175 km/h, according to the Perth TCWC. From then on, Billy began to be affected by wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures, leading to continuous weakening. Already completely disorganized, Billy was downgraded to a remnant tropical low on December 27. Consequently, both the Perth TCWC and the JTWC issued their final advisories on the system that same day. Billy did not cause serious damage in Australia as it struck a region with low population density. Only indigenous communities were significantly affected by the cyclone, mainly due to the associated torrential rains, which left at least two indigenous communities isolated."

                "content": "An area of meteorological disturbances that persisted east of the region known as \"Top End,\" located in the far north of Australia's Northern Territory, began to show signs of organization on December 16. Initially, the system exhibited only a weak low-level cyclonic circulation and few areas of associated deep convection. However, the disturbance was located in a region with very favorable meteorological conditions, such as low wind shear and warm ocean waters. As a result, the system began to become more prominent, and the Darwin Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Australia classified it as a tropical low the following day, equivalent to a tropical depression. Moving slowly southward and entering the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, the disturbance continued to consolidate, even with its low-level cyclonic center already very close to the coast. Consequently, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system on the morning (UTC) of December 18, indicating that the disturbance could become a significant tropical cyclone within 12 to 24 hours. With the system's continued organization, the Darwin TCWC classified it as a full tropical cyclone, naming it \"Billy.\" Billy's slow movement allowed the cyclone to continue intensifying, even while being very close to the Australian coast. Good outflow patterns aided the system's intensification. As a result, the JTWC classified the system as a significant tropical cyclone later that afternoon. Billy continued to intensify rapidly throughout the rest of the day. The cyclone began moving slowly southeastward, which helped the system intensify as this trajectory delayed the contact of its low-level cyclonic center with the coast, which would have disrupted its organization. The rapid intensification trend continued on December 19, and that morning (UTC), the Darwin TCWC classified Billy as a category 2 cyclone on the Australian scale. From then on, Billy began moving southward and later west-southwestward that day. Billy made landfall around 22:30 (UTC) on December 19, on the coast of the Kimberley region near the town of Wyndham, with maximum sustained winds of 75 km/h, according to the JTWC. From then on, Billy began to weaken rapidly as it interacted with land. Consequently, the Darwin TCWC downgraded the cyclone to a system with intensity equivalent to category 1 on the Australian scale during the early hours of December 20 (UTC). Moving west-southwestward over the Kimberley region in Western Australia, Billy continued to weaken rapidly as it lost much of its deep convection areas. As a result, the Darwin TCWC downgraded the cyclone to a tropical low later that morning. However, Billy's remnant system remained structurally organized, even over land, and maintained maximum sustained winds of 45 km/h as it moved west-southwestward under the influence of a subtropical high over Australia. Over the Kimberley region, the system left the Darwin TCWC's area of responsibility to enter the Perth TCWC's area of responsibility. After about 48 hours over land, the system reached the Indian Ocean during the early hours (UTC) of December 22. Under very favorable meteorological conditions, such as the very warm waters off the Pilbara coast in Western Australia, low wind shear, and excellent outflow provided by a mesoscale upper-level anticyclone, Billy rapidly re-intensified. Consequently, the Perth TCWC reclassified the system as a full tropical cyclone later that morning (UTC). Initially, Billy was unable to intensify rapidly as it moved southwestward, parallel to the Australian coast. However, from the afternoon (UTC) of December 23, Billy began moving more westward as the subtropical high to its south continued to intensify. This allowed the low-level cyclonic center of the system to move away, resulting in the cyclone's intensification. Consequently, the Perth TCWC classified Billy as a category 2 cyclone on the Australian scale later that night (UTC). From the early hours of December 24, Billy began undergoing a period of rapid intensification, reflecting the very favorable meteorological conditions, particularly the excellent upper-level outflow. Later that morning, a \"pinhole\" eye began forming at the center of the cyclone's deep convection areas, indicating continued and rapid intensification. At that time, the Perth TCWC classified Billy as a category 3 cyclone on the Australian scale, which also classified the system as a severe tropical cyclone. The rapid intensification trend continued, and the Perth TCWC classified Billy as a category 4 cyclone on the Australian scale later that morning. Later that day, Billy reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h, according to the JTWC, or 175 km/h, according to the Perth TCWC. The cyclone maintained its peak intensity for about 12 hours before beginning to weaken. Its eye began to fill with clouds, indicating that Billy had started to weaken as the cyclone began moving west-northwestward when a second subtropical high formed southwest of the system. Billy continued to weaken slowly on December 25 due to the effects of increased wind shear caused by the approach of a shortwave trough and the decrease in sea surface temperatures. Consequently, the Perth TCWC downgraded the cyclone to category 3 on the Australian scale later that afternoon. Billy's weakening trend continued on December 26, and the Perth TCWC further downgraded the cyclone to category 2 on the Australian scale. Wind shear increased on December 27, and along with lower sea surface temperatures, this caused Billy's weakening trend to accelerate, and it was downgraded to a category 1 cyclone later that day. Due to strong wind shear, nearly all of the cyclone's deep convection areas dissipated, further accentuating Billy's weakening trend. Consequently, the JTWC issued its final advisory on the system that night. The Perth TCWC continued to classify Billy as a full tropical cyclone until midday (UTC) on December 28, when Billy was downgraded to a remnant tropical low, and the Perth TCWC also issued its final advisory on the system. Billy's remnant low-pressure area continued moving slowly westward, leaving the Perth TCWC's area of responsibility days later. Within the area of responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Réunion, the system played a key role in the formation of Severe Tropical Storm Dongo."

Immediately, the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Brisbane, Australia, classified the system as a tropical low. Moving slowly eastward, the system soon reached the Coral Sea. With highly favorable meteorological conditions, such as low wind shear and warm ocean waters, the system began to organize more rapidly, and its low-level cyclonic center started to consolidate continuously with the formation of new areas of deep convection. From then on, the system began to be affected by moderate to strong wind shear, which started to displace its areas of deep convection to the western quadrant of its cyclonic circulation. The system stopped moving eastward as the formation of a subtropical high to its southeast began to steer the disturbance west-southwest. The less favorable meteorological conditions did not prevent the system's development, which was classified as tropical cyclone \"Ellie\" by the TCWC in Brisbane during the afternoon (UTC) of January 31. Later that night (UTC), the system already showed sufficient organization to be declared a significant tropical cyclone by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, which classified the system based on surface meteorological analyses, as measurements using the Dvorak technique did not reflect the system's true intensity. Moving southwest along the northwestern periphery of a subtropical high, Ellie was unable to intensify due to the effects of strong wind shear, which displaced its areas of deep convection to the western quadrant of the storm, leaving its cyclonic center cloud-free. As a result, Ellie reached its peak intensity on the night (UTC) of January 31, with maximum sustained winds of 75 km/h. Continuing southwest, Ellie maintained its peak intensity for about 24 hours before making landfall on the Queensland coast near the town of Mission Beach, around 15:00 (UTC) on February 1, during its peak intensity. At that time, the TCWC in Brisbane downgraded Ellie to a remnant tropical low and issued its final advisory on the system. Later that day, the JTWC also issued its final advisory on the system as the cyclone moved over land, rapidly weakening. The remnant low-pressure area then continued westward over northern Australia, contrary to forecasts that predicted the system would move eastward again and strengthen once it reached the Coral Sea. The remnant system of Ellie completely dissipated as it passed over the Northern Territory, Australia, days later."

Being the eleventh tropical cyclone and the eighth named tropical system of the 2006-07 cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean, Humba formed from a tropical disturbance north of the Cocos Islands on February 20 and moved southwest, reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h, according to the JTWC, or 140 km/h, according to the CMRE of Réunion. At the end of February, Humba weakened and, encountering unfavorable conditions, became an extratropical cyclone on February 26, dissipating completely on March 4.

                "content": "The area of convection that would give rise to Cyclone Humba was first observed on February 18, about 460 km north of the Cocos Islands, a small group of islands southwest of Indonesia belonging to Australia. The following day, the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Perth, Australia, observed the formation of a tropical low (i.e., tropical depression). Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system as a tropical disturbance. At that moment, the system already had a low-level cyclonic center, although large and disorganized. The upper-level outflows associated with the system were favorable, especially on the southern and northern sides of the system, caused by an upper-level anticyclone, which also provided low wind shear. With the system's consolidation, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) during the night (UTC) of February 20, mentioning the possibility of the system becoming a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours. Around midday (UTC) on February 21, with the continued improvement of the outflows and further reduction in wind shear, the JTWC issued its first regular advisory on Tropical Cyclone 16S. At that time, the cyclone's center was located about 1,745 km from Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory. Around the same time, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Réunion began monitoring the system as a tropical disturbance as it moved west-southwest, crossing the 90°E meridian, leaving the Perth TCWC's area of responsibility and entering its own. The system continued to intensify steadily, and the RSMC in Réunion classified the disturbance as a tropical depression, designating it as 11R, early on February 22. Moving mostly southwest due to the influence of a subtropical high anchored over Western Australia, the system continued to gradually strengthen, becoming a moderate tropical storm early on February 23 (UTC). At that time, the RSMC in Réunion named the system Humba, which had been submitted to the southwest Indian Ocean cyclone name list by Tanzania. Following a trajectory similar to a southwestward parabola, Humba continued to intensify slowly, and the RSMC in Réunion classified Humba as a severe tropical storm on the morning (UTC) of February 24, and as a tropical cyclone 12 hours later, noting that an irregular eye had formed at the center of the main convection areas associated with the system. Early on February 25, Humba reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h, according to the JTWC, or 140 km/h, according to the RSMC in Réunion. At that time, Humba's center was located about 1,655 km east-northeast of Rodrigues. From then on, Humba began to weaken due to the approach of an upper-level trough, which induced an increase in wind shear and a decrease in outflows. During the night of February 25, Humba weakened to a severe tropical storm. With the significant increase in wind shear and the substantial decrease in sea surface temperature, Humba began undergoing extratropical transition, which was completed during the afternoon of February 26, at which point Humba was fully an extratropical cyclone. A few hours earlier, the JTWC had already issued its final advisory on Humba. The RSMC in Réunion continued to monitor Humba's extratropical system until early March 4, when its strongest winds fell below gale-force intensity on the Beaufort scale. At that time, Humba's center was located about 2,230 km southwest of Perth, Australia."

The hurricane formed over the Atlantic Ocean and soon struck Northern Europe, with Belarus being significantly affected when the hurricane reached it on January 12. The cyclone then covered the entire central part of Russia. Heavy snowfalls and squally winds hit the Kaliningrad, Bryansk, Smolensk, Nizhny Novgorod, Yaroslavl, and Tver regions. A state of emergency was declared in many regions. In some places, there was even freezing rain. Moscow and St. Petersburg were also significantly affected by the storm, with more than half of the monthly snow norm falling. In Moscow, a third of the monthly precipitation norm fell within a day. Meanwhile, the temperature rose rapidly. During the day, thermometers reached the zero mark. Moreover, atmospheric pressure broke all records. Such low readings were last recorded 70 years ago on this day. Meteorologically sensitive people were particularly affected. Snowdrifts caused numerous traffic accidents, but road services coped with the snowfall, and mobile heating points were deployed on federal highways. Drivers were strongly advised to switch to public transport. Buses, trolleybuses, and trams operated without interruptions on Wednesday. The capital's highways were unusually free. Nearly 40,000 people and 16,000 units of equipment were involved in eliminating the consequences of the storm. Roads were treated with reagents, and snow was transported to special melting points. Airports operated according to actual weather conditions. Many flights were delayed, but the situation stabilized by the evening. Within a day, the hurricane reached Kazan, where a large amount of snow also fell. By the evening of January 15, the cyclone reached the Urals, causing heavy snowfall and a blizzard in Yekaterinburg, and a storm warning was even issued in Chelyabinsk. The Orenburg region also came under the influence of the cyclone."

Additionally, hundreds more settlements across the country were left without power. The Zhitkovichi district suffered the most from the snow and ice attack—more than 50 settlements were left without electricity there. In the Zhlobin, Rogachev, Mozyr, and Oktyabr districts, \"Daniella\" left several villages without power, including hospitals, schools, and kindergartens. Energy workers prioritized these areas. More than 40 teams worked on problematic sections. By the end of the day, almost all the consequences of the natural disaster were eliminated. In Russia, due to ice on the wires, several thousand people in the Penza region were left without electricity. On many highways, there were multiple traffic accidents, and long traffic jams formed."

In Rostov-on-Don, on December 12, due to freezing rain that fell for five days with short breaks, public transport was halted, and on December 13, school classes were canceled. As a result of the disaster, more than 180,000 people were left without electricity. The cyclone reached Moscow on December 14, bringing abnormal snowfalls, and by December 15, the snow cover height broke the daily record set on December 15, 1919. At the VDNH meteorological station, the measurements reached 38 cm by 9 a.m., surpassing the previous record of 32 cm. In the nearby Moscow region, 33% of December's precipitation norm fell, while in Central Russia, it was 81%."

Forming from a tropical depression in the waters of the Mariana Islands in late August 1968, Wendy quickly developed into a typhoon and reached Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale with a pressure of 920 hPa on August 31. Wendy then moved west-northwest before changing direction westward toward the waters east of Taiwan. After passing north of the Bashi Channel on September 6, Wendy entered the South China Sea, traveled along the southern coast of China, and made landfall on the Leizhou Peninsula on September 8. On September 9, Wendy made landfall in Haiphong, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, before weakening and dissipating inland. Typhoon Wendy left significant challenges in recording its intensity at landfall, particularly in Taiwan, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, where Wendy caused severe damage, with at least 161 deaths reported in the affected countries."

The typhoon then moved westward and gradually weakened. On September 1, it entered the waters within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), passed through the southern waters of Taiwan (north of the Bashi Channel) on September 5 as a Category 1 typhoon, and entered the northeastern South China Sea on September 6. After entering the South China Sea, Typhoon Wendy moved directly westward, along the southern coast of China, making landfall on the Leizhou Peninsula (China) on September 8, and a day later, Wendy made its final landfall in Haiphong, which at the time was part of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, before dissipating in the Vietnam–Laos border area. Satellite observations of the typhoon during this period were very limited, and there were no reconnaissance aircraft when the typhoon was over the South China Sea at that time, so data on Typhoon Wendy in the South China Sea from various agencies were inconsistent and conflicting. Restored satellite images from NOAA also did not provide clear signals about this typhoon. According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), the typhoon only reached tropical storm strength (winds below 65 knots or 33 m/s) and gradually weakened over the South China Sea, making landfall on the Leizhou Peninsula with winds of 45 knots (23 m/s) and weakening into a tropical depression upon entering northern Vietnam. According to the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), Typhoon Wendy regained strength in the South China Sea, increasing by two levels from Level 12 (35 m/s) upon entering the South China Sea to Level 14 (45 m/s) in the southern waters of China, making landfall on the Leizhou Peninsula with Level 12-13 winds on the night of September 8 and early morning of September 9, and rapidly weakening into a tropical depression upon landfall in Vietnam. However, according to meteorological observation data from Vietnam, the typhoon caused strong winds of 50 m/s (Level 15) with gusts up to 57 m/s (Level 17) in Phu Lien (Haiphong) and strong winds of 40 m/s at Hon Dau."

                "content": "The center of Typhoon Wendy approached Orchid Island early on September 5,[12] where a station on the island recorded a 10-minute sustained wind speed of 65.7 m/s (above level 17). The station could not measure the typhoon's gust speed due to equipment limitations. The extremely high observation on the island was attributed to the station's high altitude and the influence of the terrain at the measurement location.[13] On Taiwan Island, a 10-minute sustained wind speed of 25 m/s and gusts of 41.6 m/s (equivalent to level 10 winds with level 14 gusts) were recorded in Taitung.[13] Rainfall over 70 hours reached 417.9 mm in Hengchun, 398.7 mm in Taitung, and some areas may have experienced over 500 mm of rainfall.[12] The typhoon caused a foehn effect in Taichung and Hsinchu, with the highest temperatures on the afternoon of September 6 reaching 39°C and 37°C, respectively.[12] The typhoon resulted in 6 deaths, 19 missing, and 3 injuries in Taiwan, with estimated agricultural and forestry damages amounting to 4.354 million Taiwanese dollars.[12] The typhoon made landfall on the Leizhou Peninsula (China) on the night of September 8 with a narrow range of strong winds.[14] According to CMA, the typhoon's wind speed upon landfall reached levels 12 and 13.[7][8] In Zhanjiang, gusts of level 13 (41 m/s) were recorded.[15] However, many wind measurement devices were damaged during the typhoon's landfall.[16] The typhoon caused destruction in a narrow area. A forest was \"split in half\" by the typhoon [the forest was divided by the typhoon's destructive path], dozens of buffaloes were \"thrown\" into the sea by the typhoon (possibly meaning blown into the sea by the wind), and hundreds of people went missing in Zhanjiang.[16][14] The typhoon caused significant damage due to shortcomings in weather forecasting at the time. When the Shantou weather radar detected the typhoon, forecasters predicted it would move into the Pearl River Delta. However, radar feedback in the Pearl River Delta did not detect the typhoon, leading forecasters to mistakenly believe the typhoon had \"disappeared.\" It was not until the typhoon approached and was about to make landfall in Zhanjiang that the Zhanjiang radar detected it, less than 20 hours before landfall.[15] In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Typhoon Wendy or Typhoon No. 7 made landfall in Haiphong on September 9, 1968, causing severe damage and \"devastation\" shortly after the United States announced a halt to bombing in the North.[17] At the same time, the North had just experienced two consecutive typhoons, Typhoon No. 3 (unnamed) and Typhoon No. 4 (international name Rose), which caused heavy rain and prolonged severe flooding above alert level 3 in the Red and Thai Binh Rivers in mid-August.[18] Vietnamese records indicate that the typhoon caused strong winds of 50 m/s (level 15) with gusts up to 57 m/s (level 17) at the Phu Lien Meteorological Station (Haiphong), measured by a Munro wind machine, a self-recording wind device from England.[9][2][19][20] The typhoon also caused strong winds of 40 m/s (level 13) at Hon Dau.[10][11] Storm surges were also recorded in Haiphong.[21] Some Vietnamese residents described Typhoon No. 7 in 1968 (Typhoon Wendy) as a \"major typhoon,\" with \"extremely strong southeast winds blowing away a house door\" and \"nearly all orange trees [...] broken.\"[22][23] Typhoon Wendy caused severe damage to houses, crops, and trees,[24] resulting in 155 deaths, 400 injuries, 87,000 m3 of dikes destroyed, and 18,000 hectares of rice flooded in Haiphong.[25] The intensity of Typhoon Wendy upon landfall in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been inconsistently assessed. A document from the Ministry of Construction (Vietnam) evaluated Wendy's landfall in Haiphong as having level 8 winds, notably rating the previous Typhoon No. 4 (Rose) as level 13 upon landfall.[26] Some documents assessed Wendy as level 12 upon landfall,[21] while others estimated Wendy's landfall winds at over 200 km/h despite its \"small radius.\"[2][19] A document by Nguyen Duc Ngu, written in 1999, described Wendy as causing \"record-breaking strong winds\" and being \"rarely seen on land.\"[11] To date, Decision No. 2901 of 2016 by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Vietnam) on \"announcing updated results of storm zoning, identifying storm risks, storm surges, and wind zoning for inland areas during strong storms and super typhoons\" assessed the strongest wind level along Vietnam's coastal strip as level 15, with gusts at level 17,[27] matching the actual measured wind speed of 50 m/s with gusts of 57 m/s at Phu Lien.[9][2][28] Exactly 56 years after Typhoon Wendy, Typhoon Yagi (Typhoon No. 3 of 2024) made landfall in Quang Ninh–Haiphong on September 7, 2024, and was assessed by the Vietnamese government as \"the strongest in 70 years on Vietnam's mainland,\" with officially announced wind speeds of level 14 (45 m/s) and gusts above level 17 (62 m/s) recorded at the Bai Chay Meteorological Station (Quang Ninh).[29][30][31] The gusts were described by Vietnamese meteorological leaders as \"the first time Vietnam has measured such winds\";[32] however, a document from the Vietnamese meteorological sector recorded Typhoon Yagi as also causing strong winds of up to 50 m/s (level 15) with gusts of 63 m/s (above level 17) at this station,[33] with sustained wind speeds equivalent to and gust intensities greater than those of Typhoon Wendy recorded in Haiphong."

Originating from the remnants of Typhoon Matmo (Typhoon No. 5) of the 2019 Northwest Pacific Typhoon Season, which moved southward into the Bay of Bengal on November 2, Bulbul gradually intensified into a severe cyclonic storm. This was the fourth recorded tropical storm to move from mainland Southeast Asia across the Andaman Sea (hence JTWC and international media still referred to it as Matmo). Additionally, it was the second storm to reach hurricane strength in this region since 1960."

On the night of October 30 and early morning of October 31, Typhoon Matmo, with maximum winds of 100 km/h, made landfall in the South Central region of Vietnam, bringing strong winds, heavy rain, and causing flooding. Storm No. 5 resulted in 1 death, 1 missing person, and caused particularly severe damage to Binh Dinh province. Matmo then gradually weakened into a low-pressure area and moved across the Indochina Peninsula, bringing some rain and moisture to Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. On November 2, Matmo's low-pressure area moved to the northern Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean. Meteorological agencies began monitoring the low-pressure area as it started to develop and grow again. After strengthening into a storm, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) named it Bulbul, but U.S. warning agencies like JTWC considered the low-pressure area 23W (Matmo) to have moved from the South China Sea, so they continued issuing warnings for Typhoon Matmo. Bulbul quickly intensified and reached a peak intensity of Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale while moving northward, prompting IMD to issue coastal warnings for Odisha and West Bengal and to ban all fishing, beach activities, and boating in and around the Bay of Bengal. About a day later, on November 9, Bulbul made landfall near Sagar Island in West Bengal at 18:30 GMT, killing at least 2 people, moving inland into Bangladesh, and causing high waves and storm surges that led to flooding. Bulbul continued moving further inland and gradually dissipated, bringing heavy to very heavy rain."

Around 18:30 GMT, Bulbul made landfall in West Bengal near the Sunderban Dhanchi forest, bringing heavy rain and winds of up to 135 km/h (85 mph) across much of the southern part of the state. Ten fatalities were reported there, four of which were caused by falling trees. A 59-year-old man was electrocuted by a lamp post, and another person died when a collapsing wall crushed him. Additionally, before the storm made landfall, a man was killed after a cedar branch fell on his head. Fallen trees also caused road traffic disruptions throughout Kolkata, and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation worked to clear these blockages. Furthermore, operations at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata were suspended for 12 hours. At least 22 people in seven coastal districts were reported dead due to causes such as falling trees, collapsing houses, capsized boats, and illnesses, while many others were injured after the cyclone swept through the coastal areas of Bangladesh. Due to the cyclone, all secondary school exams on November 9, 11, and 12, as well as the Bangladesh National University exam on November 9, were suspended. The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority suspended all operations at three seaports and river transport services during the storm's impact.

The cyclone had the greatest impact on Belarus, which it struck on March 15. For Belarus, \"Xavier\" became one of the strongest such natural disasters in its history. During the cyclone, heavy snowfall began, accompanied by strong winds. The bad weather caused problems on roads both in populated areas (including Minsk) and beyond. Numerous traffic jams formed across Belarus. The number of traffic accidents significantly increased, one of which resulted in the deaths of two people. The most severe situation was on the M1, M4, and M5 highways. The country experienced a transportation collapse. Through the efforts of authorities, emergency services, and local residents, the consequences of the disaster were successfully mitigated.

At this time, a southern cyclone moved into Eastern Europe, bringing tropical air from the Mediterranean. As a result of the collision of the southern cyclone with cold polar air, a snowstorm formed, which German meteorologists named \"Xaver.\" On March 12, Belhydromet predicted worsening weather conditions in Belarus. On March 14, a red level of weather danger and a storm warning were announced in the Minsk, Vitebsk, and Brest regions. However, information about the danger level scale for \"Xaver\" was provided by Belhydromet only to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, and the general population could not assess the real degree of weather danger. Coincidentally, on the eve of the cataclysm, the country's leadership (the president, prime minister, and speakers of both chambers of the National Assembly) departed for a meeting of the Union State in St. Petersburg. The first deputy prime minister, Vladimir Semashko, was in negotiations in Moscow. Among the top officials, only the second deputy prime minister, Anatoly Kalinin, remained in Belarus."

                "content": "The cyclone came from the south, initially covering the Brest and Gomel regions. After midnight, worsening weather conditions were recorded in the country. For example, according to the Slutsk meteorological station, a snowstorm began in the city at 12:20 a.m. At 9:00 a.m., meteorologists issued a storm warning. They predicted very heavy snowfall in the morning and afternoon, with snowdrifts on the roads, urging residents to refrain from traveling. The population ignored the warnings. On the morning of March 15, wind speeds reached 15–20 meters per second, with the wind swaying moving vehicles. When the blizzard reached Brest, the celebration of \"Maslenitsa\" in Minsk was postponed. Starting at 11:00 a.m., the capital implemented the \"Impassable Roads\" plan, allowing public transport drivers to disregard schedules and operate according to circumstances. By this time, visibility on the country's roads had significantly deteriorated, and the condition of the road surfaces worsened due to active snowfall. In the capital, vehicles were moving at speeds of no more than 30 kilometers per hour. Meanwhile, in the Chervyen region near Smilovichi around 12:30 p.m., a jackknifed road train blocked the road. When a rescue crew arrived at the scene to handle the incident, a traffic jam had already begun to form. About an hour later, a severe snowstorm intensified. The traffic jam (mainly consisting of road trains) stretched from the bridge in Smilovichi almost to the village of Karpilovka. Cars (at least 500) were lined up in three rows, partially on the opposite lane. Passenger cars caught in the jam were completely buried in snow within two hours. Local authorities and services realized the situation was getting out of control, so classes in the second shift were shortened in schools, and in Pinsk, they were canceled altogether. Even stronger winds and heavy snowfall began around 2:00 p.m. At 3:00 p.m., an 11-kilometer traffic jam was observed on the Minsk–Slutsk highway, starting from the area near the village of Gorodishche. At 4:00 p.m., flights at Minsk National Airport were halted as planes could not land. Flights were redirected to Gomel and Kyiv. Due to blocked access roads to the airport caused by snowdrifts, several thousand people were stranded in the airport building, spending the entire night in waiting areas. Simultaneously, the traffic jam on the Slutsk highway increased from 11 to 20 kilometers. In some sections, vehicles were lined up in four rows. Services halted traffic from the Minsk and Soligorsk directions toward Slutsk to allow clearing equipment to operate effectively. On average, wind gusts reached 20–24 meters per second, with a maximum speed of up to 28 m/s. In Minsk, the snow cover thickness increased by only 11 centimeters, while the maximum recorded daily increase was 26 centimeters (in 1956 and 1992). At the same time, the total snow cover thickness reached 57 centimeters, and due to the strong blizzard actively moving snow masses, drifts in many places were even higher, leading to a transportation collapse. In the Slavgorod district, 26 millimeters of precipitation fell, converted to rain equivalent."

                "content": "Massive delays in public transport began in the capital. Visibility on the roads was 200–300 meters. Hundreds of people crowded at bus stops. A significant portion of suburban and intercity routes was canceled. For residents of Minsk, the metro became practically the only way to get home, with queues already forming at its entrances by 6:20 PM. The operation of the first metro line was extended until 2:00 AM. From 6:00 PM for over an hour, to avoid overcrowding, trains did not stop at the \"Kastrychnitskaya\" station, and access to it was blocked. Soon, due to traffic jams at the exits from the capital, entry into the city was closed. According to the head of the \"Minsk-Passenger\" railway station, Vladimir Grygorovich, delays of electric trains and trains did not exceed ten minutes, although eyewitnesses reported delays of an hour and a half or more. In the Zavodski district of the city, traffic was completely paralyzed. During the storm, taxi rates in the capital increased. According to Naviny.by, a ride from the \"Kamennaya Gorka\" metro station to Skrypnikova Street was offered for 50,000 rubles, even though the distance was only three kilometers. According to TUT.by, from the same \"Kamennaya Gorka\" to the railway station, taxi drivers charged 350,000 rubles instead of the usual 70,000. During the stormy night, fares of 400,000 and even 500,000 rubles for trips within the city were reported. However, some drivers were willing to pick up passengers at bus stops and take them home for free or for a \"symbolic fee.\" A large number of traffic accidents were observed on roads across the country. During the cyclone, traffic was complicated on 30 sections of highways. The situation was particularly difficult on the Mogilev (M4 Highway) and partially on the Gomel (M5 Highway) directions. Cars were stuck on roads in the Krupki, Dzerzhinsk, Slutsk, and Borisov districts, and traffic towards Grodno (M6 Highway) was disrupted. On the Brest-Orsha highway (M1), an accident occurred with two fatalities. On that highway, in the section from Smilovichi to the village of Khutor, 32 cars and 7 trucks were stuck in deep snow. A total of 136 people were in these vehicles, including 22 children. On another route, the M4 highway, between 450 and 500 cars were stranded. \"Drivers caught in the snowstorm far from populated areas had to spend the night in their cars. Many were forced to abandon their vehicles, which were quickly covered in snow. People helped each other. For example, when we tried to assist a driver stuck on the Dzerzhinsk highway, a jeep with high clearance was ahead of us, creating a path because the road was being covered with snow instantly. Serious traffic jams were caused by heavy trucks, which could only be helped by more powerful specialized equipment,\" said Alexander Bruy, a traffic police inspector of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, in an interview with the newspaper \"SB. Belarus Today\" on March 19, 2013. By 7:00 PM, it became dark, further complicating the situation. Some people stuck in traffic sought shelter in nearby villages. Even celebrities were caught in the jams. For instance, Russian actor Ivan Okhlobystin was delayed on the Bobruisk-Minsk highway, and Vadim Saranchukov, chairman of the BPF party, was stuck on the road from the capital to Grodno near Volozhin. On Friday evening (the 15th), overnight, and Saturday morning (the 16th), employees of \"Alpha Radio\" received over four thousand SMS messages, with many people calling and writing to journalists on Skype asking for help. \"The weather forecast from the Hydrometeorological Center was there, but no one knew what would happen. When the news broadcast ended, we decided to stay on air for a couple more hours to see how events would unfold. When it became clear that there was little news on informational websites, we asked people to inform us about what was happening on the roads. Initially, listeners just told us where the traffic jams were. But then it became evident that we were not just sharing news but providing information that people urgently needed at that moment. At 10 and 11 PM, we received so many calls and SMS messages that we stopped playing music. Sometimes we would play a song, but people immediately wrote: 'Come back on air!' We received thousands of messages, and the phone did not stop ringing for a minute,\" said Dmitry Smirnov, a radio host of \"Alpha Radio,\" in an interview with the newspaper \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" on March 15, 2014. Meanwhile, Belenergo recorded the maximum number of power outages: by the evening, 1,728 transformer substations, 558 settlements, and 71 farms were left without electricity. Although snowdrifts and roadblocks hindered specialized equipment from reaching the damage sites, by morning, power was restored in half of the affected settlements. By the evening of the 16th, power outages were reported only in a few isolated locations, but even there, electricity was quickly restored by the night of the 17th. Throughout the evening and night, dozens of cars and buses began to emerge from the traffic jams. On March 16, the cyclone left Belarus, heading towards Russia, but for some time, severe traffic jams of about 30 kilometers in length were still observed on the roads. On this day, food shortages were reported in stores. The aftermath of the storm was felt for almost a week."

                "content": "Due to the absence of other state officials, all the work on organizing a crisis center to combat the disaster fell on the shoulders of Deputy Prime Minister Kalinin. During peak hours, about 1,200 units of special equipment were clearing the roads. In the capital, about 20,000 people and around 1,000 units of special equipment were involved in eliminating the consequences of the snowfall. Units of the Armed Forces of Belarus also joined the efforts. Starting from 7:00 PM on the 15th, military equipment was deployed to clear roads and rescue vehicles. By 10:00 PM, it was reported that municipal and emergency services were operating in an enhanced mode. Heating, food, and overnight stay points were organized in the capital. Similar points were also set up on the Minsk-Mogilev highway in Smilovichi and Cherven. In response to traffic jams on the Grodno and Moscow directions, district executive committees and the traffic police organized the delivery of hot food and tea. A bus with 40 children returning from an excursion to Mir Castle, blocked on the Slutsk highway in the Uzda district, was freed from the snow trap. In Volozhin, overnight accommodation was organized for 52 people in a hotel and for 25 in a local college dormitory. Vehicle towing was also arranged. Temporary accommodation for people from the M1 highway was organized in the Cherven Construction Lyceum (22 people), Smilovichi Agricultural Lyceum (51 people), and Smilovichi Agricultural College (2 people); one person with a fever was taken to the Smilovichi hospital. On the section of the road where a traffic jam had formed, round-the-clock café services were organized (in the villages of Karpilovka, Natalyevsk, and the town of Smilovichi), where drivers and passengers of affected vehicles could warm up and receive hot food. In the Slutsk district, 20 heating points were set up in all rural clubs near the roads. During \"Xavier,\" the Ministry of Emergency Situations provided assistance 211 times, pulling 363 vehicles (passenger and cargo cars, buses, and ambulances) out of snowdrifts, with 1,172 people inside, including 260 children. Despite the mobilization of all municipal services and the active participation of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, police, and ambulance services in combating the disaster, these efforts were insufficient to bring the situation under control. As a result, many people cleared courtyards and freed vehicles from the snow themselves. During the disaster, there was active mutual assistance among the country's residents: many independently distributed tea to drivers, helped fellow citizens get home, and cleared others' cars and roads of snow. The TUT.by portal's \"hotline\" organized an online help service on its website overnight, where people could request or offer assistance to those in need. In less than a day, the hotline gathered about 700 comments. Volunteers from the Protestant church \"New Life\" also joined, with parishioners helping Minsk residents get home. On the 17th, while heading from Russia to Indonesia and Singapore, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko issued a directive to all state authorities to promptly clear roads, access to public institutions, and residential courtyards during daylight hours. Deputy Prime Minister Kalinin also conveyed the head of state's appeal to citizens, urging them to actively participate in clearing courtyards and adjacent areas. The fight against the disaster and its consequences was led by headquarters established in the government and locally. They coordinated the activities of all state services (regional executive committees, Minsk City Executive Committee, Ministry of Emergency Situations, housing and communal services, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Internal Affairs, traffic police, Ministry of Defense, and others). After the cyclone, all streets and corners remained snow-covered for several days, with unprecedented snowdrift heights noted. To combat the snow in Minsk, a massive cleanup day was held on March 19, involving over 80,000 Minsk residents. Among them were 11,000 representatives of political parties and public organizations, and 1,500 representatives of territorial public self-government committees. During the cleanup, about 1,500 units of equipment, including those from external organizations, were used. According to the press service of the Minsk City Executive Committee, 80 tons of salt, over 1,500 cubic meters of sand-salt mixture, and 35,000 cubic meters of snow were removed to treat roads and sidewalks."

In Moscow, almost a month's worth of precipitation fell in a single day. While heavy snowfalls hit the capital in the first half of the day, by the second half, due to warming, utility workers were pumping out melted water. Such heavy snowfall in March had not been seen in the central regions of Russia for the past 130 years.

Fuel delivery to motorists trapped by the snowstorm was not carried out promptly. Hot food delivery was not ensured everywhere. And most importantly, having received information about the storm warning, motorists ignored it and set out on the road, violating speed limits. The Ministry of Emergency Situations also noted the lack of awareness among the population. \"The fact that people did not listen to us significantly complicated the elimination of the consequences of the dangerous natural phenomenon. After all, our service repeatedly, a day before the blizzard, warned that the roads would be covered with snow. But in fact, during the snowfall, road accidents began to occur, which blocked traffic, creating jams that, in turn, hindered snow removal. And yet, many trips could have been postponed,\" said Vitaly Dembovsky, assistant head of the Minsk City Department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, in an interview for the newspaper \"SB. Belarus Today\" on March 19, 2013. In turn, journalist Paulyuk Bykouski criticized the actions of the authorities and services during the cataclysm, as well as their level of preparedness, but highly praised the mutual assistance and initiative of ordinary citizens. In his opinion, these events showed that the authorities are not ready to take responsibility in a crisis situation, and similar problems will have to be solved by the population independently. \"It cannot be said that the state completely withdrew from solving these issues, as the Ministry of Emergency Situations, ambulance, and police genuinely helped people. But the problem of shelter and heating, it seems, was resolved mainly without the participation of the state—except for the distribution of tea to those who spent the night from Friday to Saturday in cars blocked on roads outside the city. [...] The disaster revealed that the Belarusian Ministry of Emergency Situations has little suitable equipment—according to some reports, it has only two all-terrain vehicles with low-pressure tires, which proved truly effective in combating the disaster. One all-terrain vehicle was found with the Red Cross,\" said journalist Paulyuk Bykouski in an article on TUT.by on April 1, 2013. On March 19–20, shortly after \"Xavier,\" the cyclone \"Birk,\" formed over Germany and Poland, approached Belarus. However, unlike its predecessor, formed by the collision of tropical and Arctic air masses, \"Birk\" consisted of homogeneous moderate air masses, and therefore was less active. Its atmospheric fronts significantly affected only the weather in Brest and Grodno, as well as the western part of Gomel and the southwestern part of the Minsk regions. The cyclone was much weaker than \"Xavier,\" and, moreover, municipal services were well-prepared, allowing serious incidents to be avoided. That year, snow remained until April 11. Meteorologists and the Ministry of Emergency Situations developed action plans in case of similar cyclones, and in December 2013, Belarusian rescuers conducted a command-staff exercise close to real conditions of a natural disaster. After \"Xavier,\" the color scale of danger levels (previously used by Belhydromet but intended only for the Ministry of Emergency Situations) was included in the weather forecasts of Belarusian media. The action plans of the Ministry of Emergency Situations and road services for similar emergencies were improved. The cyclone left a lasting impression on Belarusians. Weather forecasts often mentioned this snowstorm, comparing it to other similar storms that approached Belarus and assessing the likelihood of a recurrence of the events of March 2013. The Ministry of Emergency Situations even jokingly proposed measuring strong cyclones in conditional \"Xaviers.\" Belhydromet called it the \"perfect cyclone,\" referring to its good predictability, though not everyone agrees with this."

                "content": "The 2021 Pacific typhoon season refers to any tropical cyclones that formed in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and west of the International Date Line, including the South China Sea, at any time during 2021. Although there is no specific formation period, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to typhoons in the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2021 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) with international numbers starting with 21xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter W. Any tropical depression that enters or forms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility is given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). The Chinese names of storms are currently determined through consultation among the China Meteorological Administration, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. Before the 2020s, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan might have differed. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak state during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

On February 16, a tropical depression formed and was named Dujuan, affecting the Philippines and Palau. In April, a rare typhoon formed in the Northwest Pacific and was named Surigae, which rapidly developed and became the third-lowest pressure tropical cyclone of the 21st century. In July, Typhoon In-fa and Typhoon Cempaka performed a \"double typhoon dance,\" with Cempaka intensifying near the coast, while In-fa indirectly caused the July 2021 Henan floods. In September, Typhoon Chanthu formed and was repeatedly rated as a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, while Typhoon Mindulle was nicknamed the \"aesthetic typhoon\" by typhoon enthusiasts. In October, Typhoons Lionrock, Kompasu, and Namtheun performed a \"triple typhoon dance,\" with Lionrock and Kompasu successively striking the southern coast of China, while Namtheun \"revived\" in the open ocean and intensified to typhoon strength. Entering winter, fewer cyclones formed in 2021 compared to previous years, but all named cyclones developed into super typhoons, which was very rare. Super Typhoon Nyatoh explosively intensified to a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in high-latitude regions, while Super Typhoon Rai first explosively intensified near the Philippines and made landfall in central Philippines at peak strength. After crossing the Philippines and entering the South China Sea, it explosively intensified again in the central South China Sea, becoming the second tropical cyclone in the South China Sea to reach Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale."

On the evening of August 9, under the guidance of a deep subtropical high-pressure ridge to the north, the low-pressure area moved westward across the International Date Line, entering the Northwest Pacific, and the Japan Meteorological Agency took over issuing updates. On August 10 at 9:30 AM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its rating to \"high\" and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. At 2 PM, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression. Due to deep convection consolidating the low-level circulation center, at 8 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the tropical cyclone number 16W. Previously, the Madden-Julian Oscillation increased atmospheric instability, leading to the formation of multiple tropical cyclones. Subsequently, as the Madden-Julian Oscillation entered the next phase, subsiding air suppressed convection activity in the Western Pacific. The absence of the southwest monsoon, intrusion of dry air, and vertical wind shear from the southwest displacing convection eastward exposed the low-level circulation center. These unfavorable factors left the system struggling to survive on sea surface temperatures of 28°C or higher. On August 13 at 8 AM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center first upgraded it to a tropical storm.

                "content": "At 9 PM on July 23, a developing tropical depression near Minamitorishima (which formed at 9 AM on the same day) became Typhoon No. 8 and was named Nepartak. The typhoon then moved northward and proceeded northwest over the sea east of Japan. By 9 PM on July 24, the radius of the strong wind area reached 500 km, making it a large typhoon. At this stage, it was predicted to approach or make landfall in the Tohoku or Kanto-Koshin regions by the 27th. If it were to make landfall in areas such as Fukushima, Miyagi, or Ibaraki Prefectures, it would be the first such case since statistics began in 1951. This typhoon's path was extremely rare, as only two typhoons had made landfall on the Pacific side of the Kanto and Tohoku regions from the east since 1951: Typhoon No. 13 in 1989 (which made landfall near Choshi City, Chiba Prefecture) and Typhoon No. 10 in 2016 (which made landfall near Ofunato City, Iwate Prefecture). The unusual path of this typhoon was attributed to factors such as the Pacific High being located farther northeast than usual and the presence of an upper-level cold vortex. \n\nSubsequently, the typhoon gradually changed its course from northwest to west. Although it did not have a storm zone, parts of the Kanto and Tohoku regions entered the strong wind area on the night of the 26th. The typhoon temporarily moved southward and almost stalled over the sea east of Choshi City by the morning of the 27th. At this stage, parts of Hokuriku and Tokai also entered the strong wind area. During the day, it changed its course northward and moved off the southern coast of Kanto. By the night of the same day, it curved north-northwest and moved from off the coast of northern Kanto to off the coast of Sanriku. Then, before 6 AM on the 28th, it made landfall near Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture. As mentioned earlier, this was the first recorded instance of a typhoon making landfall in Miyagi Prefecture. It then moved northward through northeastern Miyagi Prefecture into Iwate Prefecture, reaching 70 km south of Morioka City by 9 AM and 80 km northeast of Akita City by noon on the same day. In the afternoon, it changed its course westward, passed through Akita Prefecture, and entered the Sea of Japan. At 3 PM on the same day, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of Akita Prefecture."

On July 26, maximum wind gusts of 23.1 m/s were observed in Choshi, 16.1 m/s in Iwaki City, and 15.3 m/s in Kitaibaraki City. On the following day, July 27, a maximum wind gust of 25.8 m/s was recorded in Choshi, and very heavy rainfall of 64.5 mm in one hour was observed on Hachijojima by 4:43 a.m., tying the record for the highest July rainfall. Additionally, heavy rainfall of 32.0 mm was recorded in Higashishirakawa Town, Chiba Prefecture, by 1:11 a.m. on the same day. Later that night, active rain clouds brought strong rainfall of 21 mm in one hour to Minamisoma City, Fukushima Prefecture, by 8:00 p.m."

This article is limited to typhoons in the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2021 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) with international numbers starting with 21xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter W. Any tropical depression that enters or forms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility is given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). The Chinese names of storms are currently determined through consultation by the China Meteorological Administration, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. Before the 2020s, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan might have differed. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak form during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

                "content": "Due to the approach of Typhoon No. 16, the activity of the stationary front along the southern coast of Honshu became active around October 4. Additionally, a low-pressure system that formed on the front off the coast of Shikoku at noon on the 5th rapidly developed as it moved along the southern coast of Honshu on the 6th, further intensifying as it advanced to the Sanriku offshore area on the 7th and the eastern seas of Hokkaido on the 8th.  \n\nAs this rapidly developing low-pressure system moved north along the Pacific coast of Honshu, violent winds exceeding a maximum speed of 25 m/s occurred on the Pacific side from the Kanto region to Hokkaido. In Onagawa Town, Miyagi Prefecture, a record-breaking maximum wind speed of 30 m/s was observed at 7:30 a.m. on the 7th, and the seas experienced fierce waves exceeding 9 meters.  \n\nAdditionally, heavy rainfall exceeding a total of 250 mm from the start of the rain was recorded on the Pacific side of the Kinki, Kanto, and Tohoku regions, as well as the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido. Particularly in parts of the Abashiri Subprefecture in Hokkaido, the total rainfall exceeded four times the average monthly rainfall for October.  \n\nThis storm caused one death, 43 injuries, one completely destroyed house, 18 partially destroyed houses, 978 houses with partial damage, 293 houses flooded above floor level, and 1,004 houses flooded below floor level.  \n\nRegarding landslides, there was one debris flow, two landslides, and 34 slope failures.  \n\nAs for rivers, eight rivers in eight water systems, including the Abashiri River, exceeded the flood danger level, and 20 rivers in 15 water systems exceeded the flood warning level, resulting in flooding and other damages in various areas.  \n\nIn terms of lifelines, approximately 150,000 households experienced power outages in the Hokkaido and Tohoku Electric Power service areas, and 8,056 households in Hokkaido and other areas experienced water supply disruptions.  \n\nRegarding roads, traffic restrictions were implemented on 448 sections of expressways, national highways, prefectural roads, and toll roads.  \n\nFor railways, train services were suspended nationwide due to rainfall regulations and other reasons.  \n\nIn aviation, 78 flights were unable to land at Narita International Airport (the highest number since its opening).  \n\nPublic civil engineering facilities suffered damage at 1,378 river locations, 124 coastal locations, 11 erosion control facilities, 603 road locations (including bridges), 30 port locations, and 5 park locations.  \n\nIn the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sectors, damage occurred at 940 farmland locations, 1,171 agricultural facilities, 222 forest degradation locations, 722 forest road facilities, 6,971 hectares of forest, and 155 fishing port facilities.  \n\nFurthermore, due to this low-pressure system, a series of ship groundings and capsizings occurred at sea, resulting in 19 deaths and 14 missing persons due to maritime accidents.  \n\nAdditionally, due to the cold air flowing in behind the low-pressure system, mountain accidents occurred in Nagano and Gifu Prefectures.  \n\nStorm surges also occurred along the coast of Ibaraki Prefecture and other areas.  \n\nSubsequent investigations revealed that an unusual storm surge caused by Ekman transport associated with the low-pressure system had occurred."

The typhoon slowly moved northwest while intensifying, becoming a very strong typhoon, and changed its course to the northeast over the Philippine Sea on the 12th. On the 14th, Minami-Daitō Island entered the strong wind area, and on the 15th, Okinawa Island also entered the strong wind area. However, from the 15th to the 16th, it remained almost stationary about 330–380 km south of Minami-Daitō Island, near 22°N, 131°E. On the 16th, it began moving westward again, and on the 17th, it changed its course to the north-northwest and then north, exhibiting complex movements over the sea south of Okinawa. Subsequently, the typhoon shifted its course to the northeast, weakening to a central pressure of 985 hPa, a maximum wind speed of 25 meters per second, and a maximum instantaneous wind speed of 35 meters per second by 9:00 AM on the 18th, with the storm area dissipating. It moved northeast over the sea south of the Japanese archipelago and became an extratropical cyclone over the Pacific Ocean at 9:00 PM on the 19th."

The number of typhoons that formed was 21, the fourth lowest on record since statistics began in 1951, and the number of typhoons that formed after October was two, the lowest ever recorded [1]. One reason for the low number of typhoons after October was the less active convective activity over the seas east of the Philippines compared to usual [1]. Due to the low number of typhoons, the number of typhoons that approached Japan was nine, below the average, but the number of landfalling typhoons was three, which was about average [1]. Typhoon No. 6, which made landfall in Shikoku in July, was designated as a locally severe disaster, and Typhoon No. 12, which made landfall in September, caused extensive damage, particularly in the Kii Peninsula. Additionally, Typhoon No. 15, which made landfall in Shizuoka Prefecture in September, traversed eastern Japan and also affected the Tokyo metropolitan area."

Therefore, earlier typhoons like \"Ashio Typhoon,\" as well as \"Muroto Typhoon\" and \"Makurazaki Typhoon,\" are not official names but rather common names. At the time, the term \"typhoon\" itself was not in use, and the name \"Ashio Typhoon\" was later given due to the extensive damage in the Ashio area of Tochigi Prefecture. It is unclear when the name \"Ashio Typhoon\" began to be used. In the 1992 publication \"Bofu Taifu Bikkuri Kojiten\" (Kodansha Bluebacks, Moriya Shimada), although the damage and observation data of this typhoon are explained in detail, the name \"Ashio Typhoon\" does not appear. Even before that, prominent meteorologists like Tohei Otani mentioned this typhoon, but they did not use a specific name. It is believed that the name became widely recognized in the early 21st century or, at the earliest, the late 20th century. However, it is possible that it had been used locally or within limited areas for a long time. [1]"

At that time, wireless communication had only recently been put into practical use, and only a few ships were equipped with it. Consequently, the maritime weather observation network was extremely weak, and particularly in the southeastern seas of Japan, there were few ships navigating, making it difficult to obtain meteorological data. Furthermore, small-scale typhoons like this one were hard to detect and typically did not appear on observation networks until just before landfall. The first confirmation of its existence was at dawn on September 28, northeast of Hachijojima. According to the Central Meteorological Observatory's \"Meteorological Handbook,\" the subsequent path was as follows (all times are in Japan Standard Time)."

Then, on September 28, after the Ashio Typhoon traversed the eastern Japan region and exited into the Sea of Japan, its center made landfall east of Cape Shionomisaki at 3 PM. It crossed west of Daiosaki, near Hikone, east of Fukui, and west of Kanazawa, passing through the Noto Peninsula, and by 11 PM, it exited north of Sado Island. On the morning weather map of September 28, the two typhoons were almost aligned side by side, and the Ashio Typhoon on the eastern side reached a traveling speed of 60 to 80 km/h while passing through Honshu, which was quite fast. It is believed that this high speed significantly contributed to the intense winds experienced in areas east of the typhoon's path, including Mount Tsukuba. It is thought that the \"Fujiwhara effect\" between the two typhoons caused the Ashio Typhoon to accelerate. This is considered the oldest recorded case of the Fujiwhara effect observed in typhoons. There are several types of Fujiwhara effects, but when two typhoons align east-west and move northward, their vortices can interfere with each other, causing the eastern typhoon to accelerate and move rapidly while the western typhoon slows down. Similar cases have occasionally been observed since then."

Additionally, a debris flow occurred in Nikko Chugushi. The sediment that flowed into Lake Chuzenji caused 3-meter-high waves, resulting in casualties at inns and other locations. These waves flowed over Kegon Falls into the Daiya River, washing away the Shinkyo and Otani bridges. The \"Narabi Jizo\" statues at Kanmangafuchi were also washed away.

Alice formed on May 16, 1961, moved through the central and northern South China Sea, and passed over Hong Kong on May 19, causing damage. Two days later, it entered the East China Sea and weakened into dissipation. Additionally, the time taken for the Observatory to issue signals from No. 1 to No. 10 was only 16 hours and 35 minutes, the shortest in history. The No. 10 Hurricane Signal issued due to Alice lasted only 2 hours and 30 minutes, making it the shortest duration for a No. 10 signal in Hong Kong's recorded history. It is also the only tropical cyclone requiring the issuance of a No. 10 signal in May, a record that remains unbroken. Based on measured wind speeds, as no hurricane-force winds were recorded within Hong Kong [1], the No. 10 signal was considered not fully justified for Hong Kong, as the intensity near Hong Kong did not reach typhoon level but was only at the severe tropical storm level."

After several days of further intensification, it strengthened into a typhoon on May 18 and was named Alice. Subsequently, Alice turned northeastward, passing over the northern South China Sea, and made landfall in Hong Kong on May 19. After landfall, it immediately moved northeastward and weakened over eastern Guangdong. Two days later, it entered the East China Sea from the coast of Zhejiang Province and gradually dissipated."

At 6:40 PM the same day, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 3 signal. As Alice approached Hong Kong, the Observatory upgraded to the No. 7 signal at 5:50 AM on May 19, followed by the No. 9 signal at 8:35 AM. By 9:00 AM, the Observatory recorded gusts of 69 knots (about 128 kilometers per hour). Based on radar observations, the Observatory anticipated that Alice's eye would pass over Hong Kong around 1:00 PM and decided to hoist the No. 10 signal at 10:30 AM, which lasted for 2 hours and 30 minutes, making it the shortest duration for a No. 10 signal caused by a tropical cyclone in Hong Kong's post-World War II records. According to measured wind speeds, as no hurricane-force winds were recorded within Hong Kong, the No. 10 signal was considered substandard for Hong Kong, with Alice's intensity near Hong Kong not reaching typhoon level but only a severe tropical storm level. Its center began passing through the urban areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon, as well as the Observatory headquarters, around noon that day, with the lowest average sea-level pressure recorded at 981.8 hPa. Initially, the area experienced easterly winds, with the highest sustained wind speed recorded at about 43 knots (about 80 kilometers per hour) and the highest gust at 89 knots (about 165 kilometers per hour). Calm winds were observed for about 16 minutes starting at 1:04 PM. As the eye passed, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 6 signal at 1:00 PM, indicating a shift to strong southwesterly winds. At 4:00 PM, the Observatory recorded sustained winds of about 42 knots (about 78 kilometers per hour) and gusts of 74 knots (about 137 kilometers per hour). As Alice moved away from Hong Kong, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 signal at 7:30 PM and removed all signals by 2:00 AM the following day, with a total signal duration of only 34 hours. According to post-event statistics from the Royal Hong Kong Observatory, five people died, and 20 were injured during Alice's impact on Hong Kong. Additionally, ten vessels were damaged, including one ocean-going ship and nine fishing boats. The urban areas were also affected by the storm, with the Man Wah Village in Ho Man Tin, Kowloon, being particularly severely impacted, where at least six village houses collapsed."

Vera formed north of 25 degrees latitude, which is rare for a system to develop there and intensify into a severe typhoon as classified by the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan, or a super typhoon as classified by the China Meteorological Administration after 2006 (with maximum sustained wind speeds reaching 51 m/s). Additionally, Vera rapidly intensified from a tropical depression to a severe typhoon within just 48 hours. Its circulation area was extremely small (equivalent to half the size of Taiwan), its rapid development, and its V-shaped trajectory were also considered unusual."

                "content": "On the morning of July 26, 1977, at 8:00 AM, a tropical disturbance, the precursor to Vera, was observed via satellite imagery, with its center located at 25.5°N latitude and 133.6°E longitude. Over the next 24 hours, the disturbance moved westward and continued to intensify. At 1:00 PM the following afternoon, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. By 8:00 AM on July 28, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the designation 07W. Shortly thereafter, the tropical depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Vera. Due to the influence of the subtropical high-pressure system east of Honshu, Japan, and the constraint of a tropical depression to the southeast, Vera subsequently moved west-southwest. At 9:30 PM, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan issued a sea typhoon warning for Vera. By 2:00 PM on July 29, the Central Weather Bureau upgraded Vera to a moderate typhoon, and an hour later, issued a land typhoon warning for northeastern and northern Taiwan. At noon on the same day, the high-pressure system began extending southwestward toward Vera's leading edge, causing Vera to shift to a southwestward trajectory. Vera gradually intensified, and by 2:00 PM on July 30, its central wind speed had increased to 100 knots (equivalent to 52 meters per second), making it a severe typhoon under the standards of the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. That evening at 8:00 PM, satellite data indicated that Vera began shifting to a west-northwest trajectory. Shortly thereafter, its center passed near Japan's Iriomote and Ishigaki Islands. By 8:00 AM on July 31, Vera reached its peak intensity, with a central wind speed of 110 knots (equivalent to 57 meters per second). Its intensity then gradually weakened as it approached Taiwan. At 5:30 PM on July 31, Vera made landfall in Keelung City and moved southwestward along the Keelung River Valley toward Taipei City at a speed of 11 knots (equivalent to 20 kilometers per hour). Both Keelung and Taipei recorded new maximum wind speed records under Vera's impact. After passing northeast of Taipei City, Vera continued moving almost directly westward and entered the Taiwan Strait between Taoyuan and Hsinchu at 9:30 PM that evening. By 9:00 AM on August 1, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan lifted the land typhoon warning. At 10:00 AM, Vera made landfall near the coastal waters northeast of Kinmen County in Hui'an County, Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, China. By 4:00 PM, the Central Weather Bureau lifted the sea typhoon warning. At 8:00 PM, after passing through Jinjiang and Longyan, Vera weakened into a tropical depression. It then entered Jiangxi Province and dissipated in Guizhou on August 3."

It was soon upgraded to the fifth tropical depression by the JTWC analysis and was recognized as Typhoon No. 3, named \"Faye,\" at 9 PM on July 17. The typhoon then changed its course to the west-northwest and advanced to about 200 km south of Naha, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, by 9 AM on July 21. From the morning of July 22, it began to gradually turn eastward. At the time of the turn, its strength was classified as \"medium\" with a central pressure of 965 hPa and maximum wind speeds of 30 m/s, and its size was \"medium\" with a diameter of approximately 650 km. Initially, it was predicted that the typhoon would not develop significantly due to the influence of shear located to the northeast, and this prediction seemed somewhat accurate as the typhoon only developed to a \"medium\" strength even after more than four days since its formation. However, the typhoon began to intensify suddenly as it turned, and by 3 PM on July 22, it was upgraded to a \"strong\" intensity with a central pressure of 955 hPa and maximum wind speeds of 35 m/s. By 3 AM on July 23, it had become a powerful typhoon with a central pressure of 950 hPa, maximum wind speeds of 40 m/s (75 kt), and a 1-minute average maximum wind speed of 55 m/s (105 kt) according to JTWC analysis. This development occurred at a relatively high latitude of over 27 degrees north, making it even more unexpected. Eventually, after passing over the eastern waters of Jeju Island, Typhoon Faye made landfall on Namhae Island at around 4 PM on July 23 with a central pressure of 960 hPa and maximum wind speeds of 35 m/s. Due to its eastward turn after the re-curve, there was speculation that the typhoon might pass through the Korea Strait or make landfall in Japan, but it suddenly changed its course to move directly northward near 32 degrees north latitude and made landfall on the Korean Peninsula. Subsequently, it rapidly weakened while traversing the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula at a relatively fast speed of 30–40 km/h, and by around 2 AM on July 24, it had significantly weakened to a \"weak\" intensity with a central pressure of 994 hPa and maximum wind speeds of 20 m/s as it exited into the East Sea through the waters off Samcheok, Gangwon Province. Later that day, at 9 PM, it weakened into a tropical depression over the northern part of the East Sea and completely dissipated near a point about 20 km northeast of Kushiro City, Hokkaido, Japan."

Unlike most typhoons that peak between 15 and 25 degrees north and then gradually weaken, it followed a distinct development process. Although the duration of its peak intensity was not very long due to its high latitude, it made landfall on the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula with near-peak strength, as it reached the peninsula less than half a day after it began to weaken. As a typhoon of \"strong\" intensity, it was the first of its kind in about eight years since Typhoon Selma in 1987. Its landfall strength (central pressure of 960 hPa / maximum wind speed of 35 m/s) ranks among the strongest typhoons to make landfall on the Korean Peninsula. Notably, according to the JTWC's analysis, it made landfall with a maximum wind speed of 50 m/s (95 kt), making it one of the most powerful typhoons following Typhoon Sarah in 1959 and Typhoon Maemi in 2003. The storm brought by this powerful typhoon caused record-breaking maximum wind speeds in southern regions, such as 46.6 m/s in Tongyeong, 42.3 m/s in Busan, and 39.0 m/s in Yeosu. Additionally, winds exceeding 40 m/s were observed in areas like Tsushima and the western coast of Kyushu in Japan. The typhoon's structural characteristic of a steep pressure gradient near its center amplified the wind's strength. However, these strong winds were mainly concentrated near the typhoon's center or in the dangerous semicircle, affecting areas like eastern Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangnam-do, and coastal regions. Other areas did not experience such strong winds. Compared to the powerful storms in the typhoon's center and dangerous semicircle, the navigable semicircle on the left side of the typhoon's path was much weaker. Furthermore, as the typhoon rapidly weakened upon making landfall, it had already lost its storm-force winds (winds exceeding 25 m/s) by the time it moved inland over the Korean Peninsula. Thus, while record-breaking maximum wind speeds of 30–50 m/s were observed along the southern coastal regions, areas in the navigable semicircle or deeper inland, such as Jeju Island, northwestern Jeolla-do, and Chungcheong-do, experienced only mild winds of about 10–20 m/s. In terms of rainfall, the typhoon was unremarkable. During its impact on the Korean Peninsula from July 23 to 24, rainfall exceeded 100 mm in some southern regions, such as Namhae and Yeosu, which recorded 218.0 mm and 143.7 mm, respectively. However, most areas received around 50 mm or less, which is below the average rainfall of past typhoons that affected the Korean Peninsula. In summary, Typhoon Fay exhibited the characteristics of a typical \"wind-driven typhoon.\""

                "content": "On the early morning of July 23, Typhoon Faye, which until the previous day had a highly uncertain path covering a wide range from the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula to Kyushu, Japan, began to take the worst possible course, making landfall on the Korean Peninsula. At 2 a.m., the Korea Meteorological Administration issued a typhoon warning for Jeju Island and the southern offshore waters, and a typhoon advisory for Busan and the southern coastal areas, gradually expanding the warnings and advisories as time passed. However, at 3 a.m. on July 23, the situation became more severe. About 12 hours before making landfall on the Korean Peninsula, the typhoon suddenly intensified, with its strength increasing from a central pressure of 955 hPa / maximum wind speed of 35 m/s classified as \"strong\" to a central pressure of 940 hPa / maximum wind speed of 45 m/s classified as \"very strong\" (currently categorized as a \"very strong typhoon,\" but at the time classified as an \"A-grade typhoon\"). It reached a strength comparable to Typhoon Sarah in 1959, which is recorded as the worst typhoon to approach the Korean Peninsula since the founding of South Korea. As a result, tension heightened across the Korean Peninsula, but the typhoon weakened slightly just before making landfall and rapidly diminished after landfall, preventing the catastrophic damage that had been feared. However, the lack of awareness regarding the storm brought by the first \"strong\" typhoon in about eight years since Typhoon Selma led to a series of casualties due to non-compliance with safety regulations, such as a car being swept away by waves while driving along the coast, resulting in all passengers being killed or missing. The Seaprincess ship accident, caused by continuing navigation despite the typhoon warning, is a representative example of the lack of caution regarding this typhoon."

However, post-analysis revised the peak intensity to a central pressure of 950 hPa and a maximum wind speed of 40 m/s, and the intensity at the time of landfall on the Korean Peninsula to a central pressure of 960 hPa and a maximum wind speed of 35 m/s."

Leo intensified into a typhoon on April 30. Under the combined influence of Leo and the northeast monsoon, strong winds were recorded in offshore waters and high ground in Hong Kong, with rough seas. The Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 4:15 pm on April 30. Leo continued to approach Hong Kong over the next two days. On May 2, winds strengthened on Waglan Island, reaching gale force before noon. In the afternoon of May 2, Leo's low-level circulation center continued to be steered by low-level easterly winds, moving northwest-northward towards Hong Kong. However, its deep convection was sheared off by upper-level westerlies, weakening it into a tropical storm. As the Observatory predicted that Leo would maintain tropical storm intensity within 100 kilometers of Hong Kong, the No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal was issued at 1:30 pm that afternoon. This was the earliest issuance of a No. 8 Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal since 1946. Waglan Island recorded an hourly average wind speed of 90 kilometers per hour and a maximum gust of 130 kilometers per hour between 12 pm and 1 pm on May 2. Leo then passed about 45 kilometers southeast of the Hong Kong Observatory at 5 pm. However, Leo later turned northeast and moved inland, away from Hong Kong, and winds in Hong Kong subsided. During this period, three weather stations in Hong Kong recorded gale-force winds, while three other rural weather stations recorded strong winds. As Leo weakened into a tropical depression while passing east of Hong Kong, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 5:30 pm. By 8:45 pm, Leo had moved further away from Hong Kong and made landfall near Daya Bay, with all signals being canceled.\n\nUnder Leo's influence, there were six reports of fallen trees in Hong Kong. Three men were rescued after being in distress at sea, and a woman sustained minor injuries after slipping in Chai Wan. Slippery roads also caused 13 injuries in three traffic accidents. Most ferry services were temporarily suspended during Leo's impact. Two flights to Hong Kong and Bangkok were canceled. Shark prevention nets at five beaches on Hong Kong Island were severely damaged by large waves. Additionally, a cargo ship sank about 275 kilometers southeast of Waglan Island on April 30 due to rough seas. One crew member died, 13 went missing, and seven others were rescued from the rough waves.\n\nMany citizens were dissatisfied with the Observatory's actions, as Leo quickly weakened into a tropical depression and changed direction shortly after the No. 8 Signal was issued, which was only in effect for four hours, causing public confusion. Due to terrain shielding and the rapid collapse of Leo's wind structure, winds in Hong Kong were relatively weak, leading some citizens to question whether the No. 8 Signal was necessary. Some believed the Observatory should have observed the weather conditions in Hong Kong from noon to dusk on May 2 before deciding whether to issue the No. 8 Signal, rather than hastily issuing it when a tropical storm entered within 100 kilometers of Hong Kong, causing public confusion. In this situation, the issuance of the No. 8 Signal led citizens to mistakenly believe that winds were generally weak during such signals, prompting them to go out, and some even chased the storm along the coast. Others believed that the Observatory's prediction that Leo would enter within 100 kilometers of Hong Kong as a tropical storm justified the issuance of the No. 8 Signal.\n\nThe Observatory later explained that all relevant factors are considered when deciding whether to issue higher signals, but public safety is the primary concern. Waglan Island recorded an hourly average wind speed of 90 kilometers per hour between 12 pm and 1 pm on May 2. The Hong Kong Underground Observatory pointed out that this indicated gale-force winds had affected southern offshore areas and showed signs of possibly extending to more areas. It was not feasible for the Observatory to wait several more hours to decide whether to issue the No. 8 Signal, and from the perspective of ensuring public safety, the issuance of the No. 8 Signal was necessary."

                "content": "The typhoon that formed east of the Philippines on September 25, 1917 (Taisho 6) passed near Daito Island on the 29th, caused significant damage to the Kinki region late at night on the 30th (as described later), passed between Shizuoka and Hamamatsu on the same day, and traversed the Kanto region from southwest to northeast on October 1. During this time, it directly hit Tokyo, the capital. In central Tokyo, the maximum wind speed of 43 m/s and the lowest daily sea-level pressure of 952.7 hPa were recorded, with the record for the lowest daily sea-level pressure still unbroken to this day. The typhoon further traversed the Tohoku region and Hokkaido, causing heavy rainfall in various areas, and exited into the Sea of Okhotsk on October 2.\n\nThe nationwide damage was extremely severe, affecting three prefectures, one territory, and 25 provinces, mainly east of the Kinki region. There were 1,324 deaths and missing persons, approximately 2,000 injured, 43,083 completely destroyed houses, 2,399 washed-away houses, and 194,698 houses flooded above floor level, making it one of the worst disasters following the Nobi Earthquake of 1891 (Meiji 24) and the Sanriku Tsunami of 1896 (Meiji 29).\n\nWhen the typhoon approached Tokyo Bay, it coincided with high tide, causing significant damage to coastal areas along Tokyo Bay, such as Kyobashi Ward, Fukagawa Ward, and Honjo Ward, as well as districts along the Sumida River. Storm surges struck twice, flooding areas such as Tsukuda Island, Tsukishima, Tsukiji, Shinagawa, and Fukagawa. The flooding in Tsukishima, Tsukiji, and Susaki was particularly severe, resulting in many drowning deaths. The number of deaths and missing persons in Tokyo Prefecture reached 563, nearly half of the total for all of Japan.\n\nChiba Prefecture's Tokyo Bay coastline also suffered damage. The entire town of Urayasu was submerged. The Gyotoku salt fields, which had survived numerous floods since the Edo period, were completely destroyed, marking the end of the centuries-old salt production industry in Tokyo Bay.\n\nIn Kanagawa Prefecture, Tachibana District suffered the most severe damage. Of the 60 deaths and missing persons in Kanagawa Prefecture, half (32) were from Tachibana District. At Yokohama Port, over 3,100 ships and barges capsized due to wind and waves, and many dockworkers and waterborne residents lost their lives. As Yokohama Port was a key hub of Japan's economic activity at the time, the disaster dealt a significant blow to the nation's economy.\n\nIn Tokyo Prefecture, where damage was concentrated, the Kyobashi Ward, which included Tsukuda Island and Tsukishima, saw the deployment of the 1st Division, which provided meals for 7,600 people through its transport corps. In Fukagawa Ward, the military also provided support, distributing meals to 5,000 people. In Honjo Ward, many disaster victims were unable to cook due to flooding from the Sumida River, and 6,917 people were sheltered in local elementary schools.\n\nThe novelist and essayist Hyakken Uchida described the disaster caused by the heavy rain on this day as a \"hurricane\" in his essay \"After the Great Storm.\""

On February 26, the tropical disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. On February 28, the tropical depression was upgraded to a tropical depression by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and was designated as \"03W.\" Hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it \"Faxai.\" Subsequently, Faxai began to intensify rapidly, being upgraded to a severe tropical storm and then a typhoon within just two days from March 3 to 4. The system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on March 6. After Faxai transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, its remnants were absorbed by another extratropical system on March 8 in an area several thousand kilometers southeast of Japan."

As a result, Typhoon Judy became the last typhoon to be called by a female name and the first typhoon to be assigned a number after World War II."

The typhoon slowly moved westward and grew to a minimum pressure of 940 millibars by June 2 as it approached the sea east of the Philippines. After making landfall on Luzon Island on the 4th, it changed its course from north to northeast and increased speed, approaching Kyushu on the 6th. At 9:00 AM on the 7th, it made landfall near Yatsushiro City, Kumamoto Prefecture. In Makurazaki City, Kagoshima Prefecture, maximum wind speeds of 26.7 meters per second and maximum instantaneous wind speeds of 39.1 meters per second were observed. The typhoon, which traversed western Japan, became an extratropical cyclone at 9:00 PM on the same day (12:00 PM UTC on the same day) at 36°1'N, 136°9'E. Some sources indicate the dissipation point as northwest of Kofu City, Yamanashi Prefecture. Notably, this typhoon was the fourth earliest in recorded history to make landfall in Japan within a calendar year."

Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December.  \n\nThis article is limited to the waters of the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2000 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Western Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency's Typhoon Center, with international identification numbers starting with 00xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in the region identification numbers ending with the letter W.  \n\nFor tropical depressions that enter or form within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns them a Philippine name for local warning purposes. Additionally, since China, Hong Kong, and Macau use the same translation for storm names, while Taiwan's translations may differ, the same storm may have two different Chinese names. Starting from the 2020s, Taiwan and China-Hong Kong-Macau have collaborated to confirm the Chinese names of storms. Sometimes, there may also be two different English names (the international name and the Philippine name).  \n\nThe information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its strongest form during its existence."

Xangsane moved in a west-northwest direction, and at 00:00 UTC on October 27, it intensified into a severe tropical storm. At 21:00 UTC, Xangsane made landfall along the coast of Sagñay, Camarines Sur, in the southern Philippines. At 12:00 UTC on October 28, Xangsane weakened into a tropical storm. On the morning of October 29, after crossing Luzon Island, Xangsane entered the South China Sea. At 06:00 UTC, Xangsane re-intensified into a severe tropical storm. Initially, Xangsane slowed down and moved westward, later becoming almost stationary. At 18:00 UTC, Xangsane began to move in a north-northeast direction. At 00:00 UTC on October 30, Xangsane intensified into a typhoon, and shortly afterward, it reached its peak west of Luzon Island, with maximum sustained winds of 75 knots. Over the next two days, Xangsane maintained typhoon strength and continued moving in a north-northeast direction. At 00:00 UTC on November 1, Xangsane weakened into a severe tropical storm. Later that morning, Xangsane passed east of Taiwan and entered the East China Sea. Xangsane shifted to an east-northeast direction. At 12:00 UTC, Xangsane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. By 12:00 UTC on November 2, it had completely dissipated."

At that time, this low-pressure area remained stationary in the Luzon Strait due to the influence of the high-pressure ridges over the western Pacific and southeastern China. On August 18, the high-pressure area over southeastern China weakened, and sudden rain began to appear in southern China, causing the system to start moving westward. However, it was also affected by strong vertical wind shear in the northern South China Sea, showing no signs of developing into a tropical cyclone. Despite this, the low-pressure area did not dissipate; instead, its storm circle continued to expand. Later, on August 20, the vertical wind shear affecting the northern South China Sea began to weaken, and the Japan Meteorological Agency classified the system as a tropical disturbance after it entered the South China Sea. By midnight on August 21, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression, as it had already moved to the northern South China Sea near the Dongsha Islands. \n\nAt 8 a.m. on August 22, the Hong Kong Observatory also upgraded the system to a tropical depression, as it was about 670 kilometers south of Hong Kong, within the 800-kilometer range of Hong Kong. However, due to the weak intensity of the tropical depression and its storm circle being concentrated in the central South China Sea, it did not bring immediate severe weather to Hong Kong, only causing slight swells in the southern waters of Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong Observatory did not issue the Standby Signal No. 1. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center classified the system as a tropical depression in the afternoon of August 22, designating it as the sixth tropical cyclone warning (06W) issued in the western Pacific. \n\nOn the morning of August 23, the system intensified into a tropical storm, named Pabuk, and was expected to generally move toward the Gulf of Tonkin. That evening, the Hong Kong Observatory and the China Meteorological Administration upgraded Pabuk to a severe tropical storm. On August 24, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning for the system. On the morning of August 25, the Hong Kong Observatory and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression and a low-pressure area, respectively."

At 9:00 PM on the same day, they issued tropical depression information, stating that it could develop into a typhoon, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a TCFA (Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert) at 6:30 AM on August 12 (UTC 9:30 PM on August 11). At 3:00 PM on August 13 (UTC 6:00 AM on August 13), it was assigned the tropical depression number 09W. At 3:00 AM on August 14 (UTC 6:00 PM on August 13), 09W became a typhoon at 20.9°N, 142.9°E in the Mariana Islands and was named Chanthu. The typhoon slightly intensified and moved northward over the sea east of the Ogasawara Islands and Izu Islands from August 15 to 16. Although it temporarily weakened, it re-intensified on August 17, passing offshore near Choshi City, Chiba Prefecture, around 2:00 AM. It continued moving northward along the coast of the Kanto and Tohoku regions, recording its lowest central pressure of 980 hPa at 9:00 AM on the same day. The typhoon further intensified, recording a maximum wind speed of 30 meters per second at 12:00 PM, and for the first time, developed a storm zone. This was likely due to the typhoon incorporating cold air and developing as an extratropical cyclone during its transition. At around 5:30 PM, it made landfall near Cape Erimo in Hokkaido (Samani Town). At 3:00 AM on August 18, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 47.7°N, 144.6°E in the Sea of Okhotsk."

Afterward, from the morning of the 17th, the weather cleared due to the passing of the typhoon, and the influence of warm air from the typhoon caused extreme heat, with temperatures reaching 39.6°C in Tatebayashi City, Gunma Prefecture, particularly in inland areas. In the Tohoku region, heavy rain fell mainly on the Pacific side, and temporary landslide warning information was issued in many areas. In Moniwa, Fukushima Prefecture, hourly rainfall reached 55.5mm, setting a new record in observation history. In Hokkaido, the typhoon's landfall not only brought heavy rain but also record-breaking strong winds. At 19:45 on the 17th, a maximum instantaneous wind speed of 43.2m/s was observed in Kushiro City, setting a new record in observation history. Regarding maximum wind speeds, records were also set in various locations, including 31.8m/s in Kushiro City, 24.7m/s in Otsu, 24.0m/s in Tsurugaoka, 21.0m/s in Koshimizu, and 19.6m/s in Shiranuka."

On the Joban Line, operations were reduced compared to normal. On the Suigun Line, operations were suspended between Hitachi-Daigo and Koriyama, and the Karasuyama Line also suspended operations on its entire route. On the Yamagata Shinkansen, operations were suspended between Fukushima and Shinjo from the first train until late morning on the 17th. Additionally, on JR Hokkaido, a total of 54 trains, including 12 express trains, were canceled or partially canceled, affecting approximately 3,600 people. In Fukushima Prefecture, there was damage from heavy rain, including 17 houses with above-floor flooding and 19 houses with below-floor flooding in Fukushima City, as well as one house with below-floor flooding in Motomiya City. In Tamura City, a prefectural road collapsed. In Hokkaido on the 18th, the roof of a middle school in Shiranuka Town was blown off by strong winds and collapsed onto the schoolyard. Even after the typhoon passed, localized heavy rain continued in the region, causing the Tokoro River in Kitami City's Tokoro Town to exceed the flood danger level. In Ashoro Town, two rivers overflowed, resulting in flooding of houses and roads, and evacuation orders were issued for approximately 780 households and 1,620 people. Furthermore, a large-scale power outage occurred, mainly in eastern Hokkaido, with over 80,000 households experiencing outages at its peak. In Ashoro Town, about 40 houses were flooded, with above-floor flooding reported in eight houses in Sapporo City's Atsubetsu Ward and Oketo Town, and below-floor flooding in 18 houses. On the 20th, the Takahara Bridge on National Route 273 in Sounkyo, Kamikawa Town, was closed to traffic due to damage caused by the rising water level of the Ishikari River, which caused the bridge piers to sink. However, the road closure on National Route 273, including Mikuni Pass, between Mitsumata in Kamishihoro Town and Sounkyo in Kamikawa Town (15.2 km), was lifted at 2:00 PM on September 30th."

At the time of its formation, it was classified as a \"large\" typhoon. \n\nInitially, the typhoon moved northwest near the Mariana Islands, but from around the 8th to the 11th, it stalled near the Ogasawara Islands, reaching its peak intensity at 3 PM on the 8th. Subsequently, it gradually weakened, and although it began moving northwest again around midday on the 11th, it continued to weaken. By 3 PM on the 12th, when its storm zone disappeared, it became a \"super large\" typhoon for the first time since Typhoon No. 21 in 2017. However, by 3 AM on the 14th, its gale zone had shrunk, and it reverted to a \"large\" typhoon while redeveloping. \n\nDespite its weakening, strong winds were observed along the Pacific coast, with a maximum instantaneous wind speed of 41.1 meters per second recorded at Cape Muroto in Kochi Prefecture at 8 AM on August 15. Typhoon No. 10, which moved north through the Bungo Channel while engulfing the Chugoku region in its storm zone, passed through the Sadamisaki Peninsula in Ehime Prefecture shortly after 11 AM on August 15. Continuing northward, Typhoon No. 10 made landfall near Kure City in Hiroshima Prefecture around 3 PM on the same day. The typhoon then exited into the Sea of Japan, moved northward over the Sea of Japan, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 9 PM on the 16th at 43°N, 138°E west of Hokkaido. \n\nIt was the first time in 29 years that a typhoon made landfall in Hiroshima Prefecture since Typhoon No. 14 in 1990."

On the same day, it weakened into a low-pressure area and regenerated six hours later into a tropical depression at midnight on August 31. It passed through the Batanes Islands, and PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression, naming it Kabayan; however, the system exited PAGASA's area of responsibility shortly after. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for Kabayan. Kabayan made landfall in Hainan on September 1, re-emerged over the South China Sea afterward, and was upgraded by JTWC to a monsoon depression. By the end of September 2, JTWC began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as 16W, while the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it Kajiki. Shortly after, Kajiki made landfall in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Vietnam. Kajiki then re-emerged over the South China Sea, interacted with a weak tropical depression in Hainan, and subsequently absorbed this depression to intensify once again as it absorbed the tropical depression to the northeast. However, Kajiki maintained its intensity as a weak tropical depression after gradually recovering over the South China Sea. The system meandered northeastward and moved slowly until it weakened and was last noted on September 7. Kajiki's remnants developed into a low-pressure area and once again moved toward northwest Luzon on September 8. Kajiki then brought heavy rainfall to Luzon while remaining disorganized. Post-Kajiki made landfall in Batanes and continued to weaken, but the trough of Post-Kajiki brought heavy and intense rains to the Philippines, even as flooding from previous storms such as Typhoon Lekima (Hanna), Severe Tropical Storm Bailu (Ineng), Tropical Storm Podul (Jenny), and Typhoon Lingling (Liwayway) had not yet subsided. Numerous heavy rainfall warnings were issued by PAGASA across many areas affected by Post-Kajiki. In San Fernando, La Union, where disasters from Severe Tropical Storm Bailu (Ineng) had previously been elevated, flooding occurred once again, similar to Ketsana. Significant damage was reported across the country due to Kajiki's return to PAGASA's monitoring area."

Although there is no designated formation period, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to typhoons in the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2019 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (i.e., international names) and are assigned international numbers starting with 19xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter W. Any tropical depression that enters or forms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility is given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). Additionally, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan may differ. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak state during its existence.

In the following days, Pabuk moved westward into the Gulf of Thailand, crossing the 100°E longitude and leaving the Japan Meteorological Agency's area of responsibility. Meanwhile, a tropical disturbance formed east of the Gilbert Islands, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center indicated that the system intensified into a tropical depression on January 4, with expectations of further strengthening. However, the system failed to intensify further, and its low-level circulation center became difficult to identify, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to issue its final advisory. The remnants of the system generally moved westward, re-intensifying into a tropical depression east of the Philippines in mid to late January, before dissipating under the combined effects of vertical wind shear and cold air. In mid to late February, Wutip formed, moved westward, and steadily intensified, becoming the season's first typhoon on February 21. By the evening of February 23, it moved northwestward and rapidly intensified into a super typhoon. Wutip weakened on February 24 but re-intensified on the 25th, becoming the strongest February typhoon on record, reaching Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Wutip gradually weakened and dissipated starting February 26. On March 14, a tropical depression formed near the Marshall Islands, weakened into a low-pressure area after making landfall in Mindanao, Philippines, and no tropical cyclones formed in April. In May, three tropical depressions formed but did not develop into tropical storms. In June, four tropical cyclones formed, one of which was upgraded to Tropical Storm Sepat on the 27th, with two systems absorbed by Sepat, which later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the 28th, while Tropical Depression 04W moved near Taiwan. The first half of 2019 saw generally quiet tropical cyclone activity, with only three cyclones reaching tropical storm strength or higher. Entering July, typhoon formation became active. A total of five tropical cyclones formed in July: Mun, Danas, one tropical depression, Nari, and Wipha. On the afternoon of July 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded a low-pressure area in the South China Sea to a tropical depression and issued a gale warning. By the evening of the next day, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named \"Mun.\" At 12:45 a.m. on July 3, China's National Meteorological Center announced that Mun made landfall in Hele Town, Wanning City, Hainan Province. At 9 a.m. on July 14, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded a low-pressure area east of the Philippines to a tropical depression. On the afternoon of July 16, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named \"Danas.\" As Danas passed through Luzon, its circulation was affected by Luzon's terrain, splitting into two, with its low-level circulation center continuing to move northward while deep convection moved into the South China Sea. During the day, Danas slowly moved northward, merging with the tropical disturbance 90W to the east in the evening, successfully repairing its exposed circulation center. On July 18, Danas continued to move steadily northward, making landfall in Buan County, North Jeolla Province, on July 20. At 9 p.m. on the 21st, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported that Danas had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. On July 24, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported the formation of a tropical depression in the Northwest Pacific south of Japan. Shortly after, a gale warning was issued, and two days later, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named \"Nari.\" At 7 a.m. on July 27, Nari made landfall in southern Mie Prefecture, Japan. At 9 a.m. on July 30, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded a low-pressure area in the central South China Sea to a tropical depression. The following morning, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named \"Wipha.\" At 1:50 a.m. on August 1, Wipha made landfall in Wenchang City, Hainan Province, and at 5:40 p.m., it made a second landfall in Potou District, Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province. Wipha prompted the issuance of tropical cyclone warning signal No. 8 in both Hong Kong and Macau."

Affected by vertical wind shear, the system developed slowly and had a loose structure. The low-level circulation center of the system gradually consolidated on the 13th, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rated its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within one day as \"medium,\" skipping the \"low\" rating. On the afternoon of the 14th, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also raised the rating to \"high\" and issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. Due to the system's convective outbreak, showing the characteristics of a tropical cyclone, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center successively classified the system as a tropical depression at 2 a.m. and 8 a.m. on the 15th, assigning it tropical cyclone numbers 04 and 03W, respectively. That day, the system turned southwestward. Due to persistent vertical wind shear and weak outflow above the system, the tropical depression did not intensify further on the 16th. The Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan downgraded the system to a low-pressure area at 8 a.m. on the 17th. Subsequently, the system crossed Koror Island, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 2 p.m. on the 18th. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration announced that the system made landfall in Malitbog, Mindanao, Philippines, at 5:30 a.m. on the 19th. Affected by terrain, the system's central convection weakened, and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 2 p.m. At this time, the system resumed a northwest-northward path, entering Moro Bay. In the evening, the system entered the Sulu Sea, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center stated that the system weakened and dissipated during the day on the 20th.  \n\nAs the system intensified into a tropical depression, the U.S. National Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for Ngulu Atoll, Yap Island, and Kayangel Island at 11:40 a.m. on the 15th. The U.S. National Weather Service stated that the aforementioned islands were experiencing northeast winds of 4-5 levels, with stronger circulation on the northern side of the system, making Yap Island more affected than Ngulu Atoll and Kayangel Island. The U.S. National Weather Service later expanded the tropical storm watch to include Koror Island at 5:20 a.m. on the 16th. Yap Island first experienced east winds in the morning, and Ngulu Atoll and Kayangel Island experienced east winds by the early morning of the 17th. As the system moved away, the U.S. National Weather Service successively canceled the tropical storm watch for Yap Island and Ngulu Atoll at 5:35 p.m. on the 16th and 11:20 a.m. on the 17th. After the system passed Koror Island and moved west of Kayangel Atoll and the Caroline Islands, the islands began experiencing southeast winds, and the U.S. National Weather Service canceled all tropical storm watches at 5:20 p.m. The system entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration's area of responsibility in the early morning of the 17th, and the agency named the system \"Chedeng,\" issuing Signal No. 1 for parts of Mindanao. The system made landfall in Malitbog, Mindanao, Philippines, at 5:30 a.m. on the 19th and soon weakened into a low-pressure area, prompting the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration to lift Signal No. 1.  \n\nIn the best track released by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center on September 16, 2020, the peak of 03W was adjusted to 35 knots (65 kilometers per hour)."

Originating from the remnants of Typhoon Matmo (Typhoon No. 5) of the 2019 Northwest Pacific Typhoon Season, which moved southward into the Bay of Bengal on November 2, Bulbul gradually intensified into a severe cyclonic storm. This was the fourth recorded tropical storm to move from mainland Southeast Asia across the Andaman Sea (hence JTWC and international media still referred to it as Matmo). Additionally, it was the second storm to reach hurricane strength in this region since 1960."

On the night of October 30 and early morning of October 31, Typhoon Matmo, with maximum winds of 100 km/h, made landfall in the South Central region of Vietnam, bringing strong winds, heavy rain, and causing flooding. Storm No. 5 resulted in 1 death, 1 missing person, and caused particularly severe damage to Binh Dinh province. Matmo then gradually weakened into a low-pressure area and moved across the Indochina Peninsula, bringing some rain and moisture to Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. On November 2, Matmo's low-pressure area moved to the northern Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean. Meteorological agencies began monitoring the low-pressure area as it started to develop and grow again. After strengthening into a storm, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) named it Bulbul, but U.S. warning agencies like JTWC considered the low-pressure area 23W (Matmo) to have moved from the South China Sea, so they continued issuing warnings for Typhoon Matmo. Bulbul quickly intensified and reached a peak intensity of Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale while moving northward, prompting IMD to issue coastal warnings for Odisha and West Bengal and to ban all fishing, beach activities, and boating in and around the Bay of Bengal. About a day later, on November 9, Bulbul made landfall near Sagar Island in West Bengal at 18:30 GMT, killing at least 2 people, moving inland into Bangladesh, and causing high waves and storm surges that led to flooding. Bulbul continued moving further inland and gradually dissipated, bringing heavy to very heavy rain."

In the provinces from Quang Ngai to Phu Yen, there was heavy to very heavy rain. Rainfall over 24 hours was generally 150-300mm, with some places recording up to 384mm.

However, around 350 local villagers in Balesore district were moved to cyclone shelters as the storm approached landfall, and their current condition remains unclear. Around 18:30 GMT, Bulbul made landfall in West Bengal near the Sunderban Dhanchi forest, bringing heavy rain and winds of up to 135 km/h (85 mph) across much of the southern part of the state. Ten fatalities were reported there, four of which were caused by falling trees. A 59-year-old man was electrocuted by a lamp post, and another person died when a collapsing wall crushed him. Additionally, before the storm made landfall, a man was killed after a cedar branch fell on his head. Fallen trees also caused road traffic congestion throughout Kolkata city, and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation worked to clear these blockages. Furthermore, operations at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata were suspended for 12 hours. At least 22 people in seven coastal districts were reported dead due to causes such as falling trees, collapsing houses, capsized boats, and illnesses, while many others were injured as the cyclone swept through the coastal areas of Bangladesh. Due to the cyclone, all secondary school exams on November 9, 11, and 12, as well as the Bangladesh National University exam on November 9, were suspended. The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority suspended all operations at three seaports and river transport services during the storm's impact. All flights to and from Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong, Cox's Bazar Airport, Barisal Airport, and Jashore Airport were canceled for 14 hours due to severe weather under the storm's influence."

After its peak, it maintained its strength before turning northeast at 21 degrees north latitude. As it moved north to northeast, it rapidly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone due to high vertical wind shear and cold air intrusion. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone with a central pressure of 1004 hPa at 9:00 on November 9, approximately 2,000 km southeast of Tokyo, Japan. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone with a central pressure of 1004 hPa at 12:00 on November 9, approximately 2,090 km east-southeast of Tokyo, Japan.

It maintained its strong intensity, traveling northeast through the East China Sea, passing near Tsushima in Nagasaki Prefecture, and made landfall on the Tsugaru Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture around 6 a.m. on the 20th. By 6 p.m. the same day, it transformed into an extratropical cyclone over the southeastern seas of Nemuro City, Hokkaido. From the 17th to the 18th, as the typhoon moved northward from the seas near Okinawa to the East China Sea, warm and moist air from the outer edges of the typhoon flowed into western and eastern Japan, developing rain clouds and causing very heavy rain in areas such as the Shikoku and Kyushu regions. The total rainfall in Tominaga, Shikokuchuo City, Ehime Prefecture, reached approximately 600mm, about 2.5 times the average monthly rainfall for August, which is 240.9mm. Furthermore, as the typhoon stimulated a weather front, the total rainfall during the period up to the 20th exceeded 600mm in the Shikoku region, and in parts of the Tohoku region and Hokkaido, heavy rainfall of 200mm to 300mm occurred due to the typhoon and the front. Additionally, strong winds were observed mainly along the Sea of Japan side from Kyushu to Hokkaido as the typhoon approached."

The typhoon remained relatively stationary and did not develop much until around August 3, but on August 4, it rapidly intensified and began moving northward. Since the Pacific high-pressure system had covered the area near Japan after the end of the rainy season on July 13 of the same year, severe heat persisted daily, and there was so little rain that some areas even experienced concerns about water shortages. Typically, typhoons in August often move northward from the East China Sea along the eastern coast of the continent, but at that time, the high-pressure system was weak, so this typhoon gradually continued moving northward. On August 9, the typhoon made landfall near the border between Miyazaki Prefecture and Oita Prefecture. By August 11, it had transformed into an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan."

According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Construction Bureau, the tide level reached 2.89 A.P.m (A.P. refers to Arakawa Peil, the lowest tide level measured at the Reiganjima gauge in the Arakawa river system), with 13,459 houses flooded above floor level, 22,970 houses flooded below floor level, and 133 casualties. In Yamagata Prefecture, heavy rain in mountainous areas caused rivers to overflow, resulting in one death, two injuries, six completely destroyed houses, 41 partially destroyed houses, and 1,205 houses flooded above floor level. Hokkaido also reported numerous casualties. On the night of the 22nd, in Zushi City, Kanagawa Prefecture, strong winds and high waves from the typhoon caused all beach houses to be completely or partially destroyed. \n\nEven after the typhoon passed, heavy rain caused by a stationary front led to further damage in various areas. In the Hida River basin in Gifu Prefecture, muddy torrents caused significant damage. Ishikawa Prefecture experienced consecutive days of heavy rain, with severe damage in Nanao City, including house collapses and bridge washouts. In Nagano Prefecture, the Azusa River overflowed, and roads leading to Kamikochi were blocked by landslides, leaving climbers stranded at Shimashima Station. Over 2,000 people were reportedly trapped in Kamikochi and Mount Norikura. \n\nNationwide, the typhoon caused 26 deaths, 14 missing persons, 64 injuries, 1,089 houses destroyed, and 46,243 houses flooded, with total damages amounting to 4.3 billion yen. Additionally, the Kanto region in 1958 was struck by other typhoons, including Typhoon No. 21 and the Kano River Typhoon (Typhoon No. 22)."

The typhoon moved northward and made landfall near Makurazaki City, Kagoshima Prefecture, around 8:10 PM on the 8th, crossing southern Kyushu. On the 9th, it made landfall again near Uwajima City, Ehime Prefecture, from the Bungo Channel, moving eastward across the Shikoku region. It then moved into Tosa Bay and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 6:00 AM on the same day. \n\nAt 9:00 AM on the 8th, when the typhoon moved northeast beyond 30 degrees north latitude, a low-pressure system was present in the central Sea of Japan, with a cold front extending from the San'in region to northern Kyushu, moving southward. However, as the typhoon advanced northeast, the front moved southward to central Kinki but then stalled, remaining over central Kinki until 10:00 AM on the 9th, when the extratropical cyclone that had been the typhoon passed through the Kii Channel. As a result, heavy rainfall of 160–350 mm occurred from 9:00 AM on the 8th to 9:00 AM on the 9th, particularly in southern Awaji Island in Hyogo Prefecture, as well as around Kobe City and Akashi City. In particular, Sumoto City experienced record-breaking torrential rain in three waves.\n\nDue to the impact of the typhoon and the front, damage such as river flooding and inundation occurred, especially in Oita and Ehime Prefectures. In Tosa Town, Kochi Prefecture, a flash flood (debris flow) struck houses, killing two people. In Ōtoyo Town, a landslide caused houses to collapse, killing one person. Additionally, in Sumoto City, Hyogo Prefecture, a landslide caused houses to collapse, killing two people. In total, at least nine people died, and more than 8,000 houses were flooded or damaged."

At that time, a large high-pressure system was dominating around Japan, and forecasts suggested that Daina would move northeast and pass through the waters south of Japan. However, Daina continued westward and, contrary to meteorological predictions, moved west-northwest over the waters south of the Ryukyu Islands, stalling southeast of Miyako Island. On the 27th, Daina suddenly began moving again, turning northeast toward the Kii region of Honshu, Japan, and made landfall at Cape Irago on the Atsumi Peninsula in Aichi Prefecture at 3:30 a.m. the next day. Although Daina transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the same day, it maintained its intensity and continued to develop, causing severe weather across Japan. Daina was the latest typhoon to make landfall in Japan within a year since record-keeping began in 1951, until Typhoon Page made landfall in Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, in November 1990. To date, it remains the second latest on record, but Daina is still the only typhoon with a number exceeding 30 within a year to make landfall in Japan."

The typhoon continued westward for a while, then changed course to the north-northwest at 9 a.m. on August 1, and shifted to a northerly course at 9 p.m. on the 3rd. By 3 p.m. on the 4th, it had reached the western sea off Okinawa, becoming a medium-sized strong typhoon, and moved north-northeast through the East China Sea, approaching Kyushu. Between midnight and 3 a.m. on the 6th, the typhoon rapidly intensified southwest of Kyushu, with a central pressure of 940 mb (hPa) and maximum wind speeds of 50 m/s. At 4:11 a.m., it made landfall near Ushibuka City in Kumamoto Prefecture, maintaining its peak intensity (central pressure of 940 mb). It then passed through Kumamoto and Oita Prefectures, re-entered land at Ube City in Yamaguchi Prefecture via Suo-nada (its strength at this time had weakened to a central pressure of 960 mb), and exited into the Sea of Japan by noon on the 6th. The central pressure of 940 mb observed at the time of landfall in Kyushu was the fifth lowest recorded for a typhoon at landfall since statistics began in 1951. Additionally, due to the typhoon's influence, the weather, which had previously been dry due to the extension of the Pacific High, changed dramatically, with strong winds and rain intensifying in various areas, particularly in Kumamoto Prefecture."

It then crossed the Seto Inland Sea and made a second landfall near Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, around 9:30 PM. Afterward, it moved northward over the Sea of Japan and transitioned into a tropical depression at 9 AM on August 2nd.  \n\nDue to the impact of this typhoon, heavy rain occurred from July 29th to 31st on the Pacific side of eastern Japan and in western Japan, with particularly intense rainfall in the southern Kinki region and Shikoku region. From August 1st to 2nd, developed rain clouds flowed from the Pacific Ocean into the Shikoku region, causing prolonged rainfall even after the typhoon had passed. In Ehime and Kochi Prefectures, rainfall exceeded 100 mm per hour.  \n\nFrom July 29th to August 2nd, precipitation exceeded 1,000 mm in Nara and Tokushima Prefectures and 700 mm in Kochi Prefecture. Reports indicate that some locations experienced over 2,000 mm of rainfall. Observations by Shikoku Electric Power recorded a daily precipitation of 1,317 mm in Kaigawa, Kamikatsu Town, Tokushima Prefecture, setting a new record for daily precipitation in Japan.  \n\nOne of the reasons for the heavy rainfall was the extremely slow movement of the typhoon at a speed of 10 km/h, influenced by a high-pressure system on the Sea of Japan."

Although the typhoon itself was not very strong, it caused heavy rain, particularly in the southern Kinki region and Mie Prefecture, with some areas receiving over 500mm of rainfall between August 4 and 5. Additionally, the fact that it made landfall in Shikoku shortly after Typhoon No. 10 passed contributed to the severity of the damage."

According to past patterns, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December.  \n\nThis article is limited to typhoons in the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2020 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) and are assigned an international number starting with 20xx. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter W.  \n\nFor tropical depressions that enter or form within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns a local name for local warnings, meaning a tropical cyclone may have two different English names (the international name is considered official). Additionally, before the 2020s, the Chinese names used by mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan might have differed. Starting from the 2020s, the Chinese names for storms that were retired and replaced are determined through consultation among the China Meteorological Administration, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan.  \n\nThe information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

The last time this phenomenon occurred was in 2016. On May 10, a tropical disturbance east of the Philippines intensified into a tropical depression, marking the official start of the typhoon season. This tropical depression rapidly intensified into Typhoon Vongfong, which impacted the Philippines. The South China typhoon season began on June 14 with Tropical Storm Nuri making landfall in western Guangdong, becoming the second named storm of the season. The Pacific subtropical high was abnormally strong in July, making it the first recorded July without any named tropical cyclones. \n\nHowever, tropical cyclone activity became vigorous in August, with formation locations shifting westward. In early August, Tropical Storm Sinlaku, with a broad circulation and initial monsoon depression characteristics, affected Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. Simultaneously, another tropical cyclone, Hagupit, made landfall in Zhejiang as a typhoon and impacted Fujian, Taiwan, Jiangsu, and South Korea. In mid-August, Typhoon Jangmi affected Japan and South Korea. Later, Tropical Storm Mekkhala made landfall in Fujian as a severe tropical storm, while Typhoon Higos rapidly intensified and impacted the Pearl River Delta region. On August 21, Typhoon Bavi formed and later made landfall in North Korea as a strong typhoon. From late August to early September, Typhoons Maysak and Haishen consecutively impacted Northeast China, the Korean Peninsula, Japan, and the Russian Far East as super typhoons.\n\nIn mid-September, Tropical Storm Noul struck Vietnam. From late September to early October, Tropical Storms Dolphin, Kujira, and Chan-hom formed but did not make landfall anywhere. Starting in mid-October, tropical cyclone activity in the South China Sea became vigorous. Tropical Storm Linfa formed first, bringing torrential rain to Vietnam and causing significant casualties. Tropical Storm Nangka affected Hong Kong, Macau, and Hainan. Tropical Storm Saudel formed on October 19, primarily impacting the Philippines. From late October to early November, Typhoons Molave and Goni caused massive destruction in the Philippines, with Goni becoming the strongest tropical cyclone of the year, reaching maximum sustained winds of 315 km/h. On October 29, Typhoon Atsani formed, affecting southern Taiwan.\n\nOn November 7, Tropical Storm Etau formed and later struck Vietnam. On November 8, Typhoon Vamco formed, rapidly intensified, and made landfall in the Philippines on November 11. After Vamco dissipated, tropical cyclone activity in the Northwest Pacific decreased due to increasingly cold weather. On December 5, a tropical depression formed but did not intensify further. On December 17, a tropical disturbance developed into Krovanh, affecting the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand. On December 29, another unnamed tropical cyclone formed but dissipated the next day, marking the official end of the typhoon season."

At 9:25 PM, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning for it. [Source needed] At 1:00 AM on May 12, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the tropical cyclone number 01W [11]. At 8:00 PM, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm, assigned it the international number 2001, and named it \"Vongfong.\" At the same time, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded it to a mild typhoon. Subsequently, the China Meteorological Administration followed suit and upgraded it. At 10:00 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical storm. On May 13 at 2:00 AM, the Hong Kong Observatory upgraded it to a tropical storm. At 5:00 AM, the China Meteorological Administration upgraded it to a severe tropical storm. Due to warm sea temperatures, weak vertical wind shear, and good upper-level divergence, Vongfong steadily intensified, developing a central dense overcast and a cloud-filled eye. At 2:50 PM, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded \"Vongfong\" to a severe tropical storm. [12] At 2:00 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a typhoon. However, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center believed that its intensity began to weaken at dawn that day, with the structure near the center slightly disrupted [13]. Subsequently, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration determined that this tropical cyclone made landfall at 12:15 PM in San Policarpo, Eastern Samar, with a ten-minute average wind speed of 150 km/h at landfall [14]. However, Vongfong did not immediately weaken upon landfall. The Japan Meteorological Agency raised its ten-minute average wind speed to 85 knots and stated that Vongfong had reached its peak intensity [15]. However, Vongfong was subsequently affected by friction caused by the terrain, and its central wind speed rapidly weakened [16]. At 10:00 PM, the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded Vongfong to a typhoon [17]. An hour later, the China Meteorological Administration followed suit [18]. Vongfong then crossed several islands, gradually weakening due to friction, with its convection becoming more disorganized [19]. At 2:45 PM, the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded Vongfong to a severe tropical storm [15]. At 3:00 PM, the Central Weather Bureau downgraded it to a mild typhoon [20]. Subsequently, the Hong Kong Observatory and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded it to a severe tropical storm and a tropical storm at 3:30 PM and 5:00 PM, respectively [21][19]. The China Meteorological Administration downgraded it to a severe tropical storm at 8:00 PM that day [18]. Afterward, Vongfong continued to weaken, and the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded it to a tropical storm at 3:30 AM on the 16th [22]. At the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency also downgraded it to a tropical storm [15]. The China Meteorological Administration followed suit at 5:00 AM [18]. Subsequently, Vongfong entered the South China Sea, where it experienced upper and lower-level separation due to the terrain of Luzon Island [23]. After entering the South China Sea, Vongfong continued to weaken. At 4:00 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded Vongfong to a tropical depression and issued its final warning [24]. The China Meteorological Administration and the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded Tropical Storm Vongfong to a tropical depression at 5:00 PM and 6:45 PM, respectively [18][25]. On the 17th at 3:00 AM, the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression [15]. At 8:30 AM, the Central Weather Bureau downgraded Vongfong to a tropical depression [26]. At 9:15 AM, the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded it to a low-pressure area [27]. On the weather map at 8:00 PM on the 18th, the Japan Meteorological Agency determined that it had merged into a stationary front system [28]."

                "content": "At the beginning of 2020, tropical cyclone activity in the Northwest Pacific was unusually quiet. In June and July, the Pacific experienced strong subsiding airflows, while the Middle East saw vigorous ascending airflows. Under the dominance of the subtropical high ridge, only a few tropical depressions formed in the Northwest Pacific in July. In mid-to-late July, numerical forecast models predicted that the monsoon trough would become active, with a broad low-pressure zone forming east of the Philippines, crossing Luzon, and lingering in the central South China Sea. Several low-pressure vortices within this zone were expected to affect the South China coast, Fujian, and Taiwan in early August before moving northward. One of these low-pressure areas formed on July 28, and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory designated it as 91W. This system was a \"monsoonal low-pressure system\" with a broad circulation, loosely organized convective cloud bands, and an indistinct center. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the system's chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low.\"\n\nGuided by the subtropical high ridge, the system moved west-northwest, making landfall in Luzon on the afternoon of July 29 and entering the South China Sea around midnight on July 30. With weak vertical wind shear and energy provided by the hot 30°C seawater, the system slowly consolidated its organization, exhibiting stronger winds externally than internally. At 1:30 a.m. on July 31, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its assessment to \"medium.\" At 9:15 a.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency classified the system as a tropical depression and issued a gale warning. The China Meteorological Administration and the Hong Kong Observatory also upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 3:11 p.m. and 8:45 p.m., respectively. At this time, numerical forecasts and official meteorological agencies predicted the system would pass over Hainan and the Beibu Gulf area before making landfall in northern Vietnam.\n\nAt 1:30 a.m. on August 1, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its assessment to \"high\" and issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. At 2:00 p.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the international designation 2003 and naming it \"Sinlaku.\" Simultaneously, the China Meteorological Administration upgraded it to a tropical storm, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan classified it as a mild typhoon. At 4:00 p.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical storm, assigning it the tropical cyclone number 04W.\n\nOn August 2, the China Meteorological Administration reported that Sinlaku made landfall near Thanh Hóa, Vietnam, at around 2:40 p.m. At 8:00 p.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression. At 10:00 p.m., the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded it to a low-pressure area, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan also downgraded Sinlaku to a tropical depression. On August 3, at 8:00 p.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency removed the system from its weather charts. On October 20, in the Japan Meteorological Agency's best track data, Sinlaku's peak wind speed was revised to 40 knots (75 km/h), and its pressure was adjusted to 985 hPa."

Before moving out to sea, the National Meteorological Center temporarily downgraded it to a tropical depression, but it re-intensified into a tropical storm after moving out to sea. Hagupit made landfall along the coast of Hwanghae-namdo, North Korea, at 3:00 AM on August 6.  \n\nAfter entering the mid-latitude region, Hagupit gradually lost its tropical characteristics. At 8:00 AM on August 6, the Japan Meteorological Agency stated that Hagupit had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan. After transitioning, Hagupit entered a development phase, continued moving northeast, and its central pressure gradually dropped. The following day, it entered a mature phase and developed an occluded front, passing through northern Hokkaido. On August 8, Hagupit detached from the front.

At the same time, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded it to a tropical depression, assigning it the number TD12. At 5:30 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center raised its rating to \"high\" and issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. At 7:00 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression, assigning it the tropical cyclone number 11W.  \n\nAt 1:00 AM on September 1, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical storm. At 9:00 PM, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm, assigning it the international number 2010 and naming it \"Haishen.\" At the same time, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded it to a mild typhoon.  \n\nAt 2:00 PM on September 2, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center was the first to upgrade it to a typhoon, followed by the Japan Meteorological Agency. At the same time, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded it to a moderate typhoon.  \n\nAt 2:00 AM on September 3, the China Meteorological Administration and the Hong Kong Observatory upgraded it to a typhoon, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan also upgraded it to a moderate typhoon. At 8:00 PM, the China Meteorological Administration upgraded it to a severe typhoon. At 9:45 PM, the Hong Kong Observatory followed suit and upgraded it. Haishen began an eyewall replacement cycle in the evening and developed a double eyewall.  \n\nOn the morning of September 4, Haishen completed the eyewall replacement cycle and continued to intensify. At 6:00 AM, the China Meteorological Administration was the first to upgrade Haishen to a super typhoon, followed by the Hong Kong Observatory at 7:45 AM. At 8:00 AM, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded it to a strong typhoon, making it the first tropical cyclone of the year to reach this level.  \n\nDue to the weakening of the subtropical ridge caused by an upper-level trough, Haishen bypassed the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge on September 5, changing its course to move northwest at a speed of about 22 km/h, approaching the Ryukyu Islands. It was affected by subsidence airflow brought by the upper-level trough to the north, which eroded its circulation. However, with sea surface temperatures still at 30–31°C, low vertical wind shear, and favorable upper-level outflow, Haishen only weakened slowly, with its convection slightly thinning while maintaining a well-defined eye. At 11:00 AM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded Haishen to a typhoon. In the afternoon, Haishen re-entered an eyewall replacement cycle, with its double eyewall structure clearly visible on radar images.  \n\nIn the early hours of September 6, Haishen entered an area with stronger vertical wind shear, further damaging its structure, and its eye became weaker and rougher. The eyewall replacement cycle was not completed until the afternoon of September 6. The China Meteorological Administration and the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded Haishen to a severe typhoon at 11:10 AM and 4:15 PM, respectively. Radar images showed that Haishen's eye shrank after the eyewall replacement and passed over the Tokara Islands. At this time, Haishen accelerated to a speed of 35–40 km/h, moving northwest into the East China Sea and heading toward Kyushu, Japan, and Korea.  \n\nBetween midnight and the early hours of September 7, Haishen crossed the Tsushima Strait to the north, further accelerating to 45–50 km/h, passing close to the west of Kyushu, Japan, but its eyewall did not sweep over the area. Haishen's environment rapidly deteriorated, with vertical wind shear intensifying further and the sea surface temperature in the Tsushima Strait dropping. The terrain of Korea and Japan also eroded Haishen's convection. Satellite and radar images showed that Haishen rapidly weakened after midnight on September 7, with its eyewall collapsing and convection quickly becoming shallow. The China Meteorological Administration and the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded Haishen to a typhoon at 5:25 AM and 9:45 AM, respectively. According to the China Meteorological Administration, Haishen made landfall along the coast of Busan-Ulsan, Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, at around 7:30 AM, with wind speeds of 40 m/s (144 km/h). After landfall, Haishen's central dense overcast collapsed, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded it to a tropical storm at 11:00 AM. The China Meteorological Administration downgraded Haishen to a severe tropical storm at 2:30 PM, followed by the Japan Meteorological Agency at 8:50 PM. At this time, Haishen had crossed Korea, moved into the Sea of Japan, and continued to move north, where sea surface temperatures were only 22–23°C.  \n\nThat evening, Haishen made landfall in North Hamgyong Province, North Korea. The China Meteorological Administration downgraded Haishen to a tropical storm at 11:25 PM, while the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center both stated that Haishen transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 2:00 AM on September 8. The China Meteorological Administration also confirmed this at 8:00 AM, as Haishen moved into Jilin, China. The extratropical cyclone Haishen moved northwest, entering Heilongjiang, where its cloud bands and spiral structure were still identifiable on satellite images. On September 9, Haishen stalled in Heilongjiang before turning southwest and returning to Jilin, gradually weakening and dissipating over Liaoning on September 10."

The Japan Meteorological Agency and the Hong Kong Observatory assessed Goni's maximum sustained wind speed near the center (calculated as a 10-minute average) at 120 knots (220 km/h) and 275 km/h, respectively. The former tied with Typhoon Meranti in 2016, while the latter surpassed Typhoon Megi in 2010 by 5 km/h, falling just short of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 at 285 km/h. The China Meteorological Administration assessed Goni's central wind speed (calculated as a 2-minute average) at 68 m/s (245 km/h), 4 m/s short of Megi's 72 m/s (260 km/h). The Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan assessed its central wind speed (calculated as a 10-minute average) at 65 m/s (235 km/h), tying with Megi and surpassing Haiyan's 63 m/s (225 km/h) by 2 m/s. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assessed Goni's central wind speed (calculated as a 10-minute average) at 225 km/h, tying with Megi and falling just 10 km/h short of Haiyan's 235 km/h. Additionally, Goni became the second super typhoon in the Philippines after the 2014 update to typhoon classifications, the previous one being Typhoon Haima in 2016. The U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed Goni's central wind speed (calculated as a 1-minute average) at 170 knots (315 km/h), tying the records of Typhoon Haiyan and Meranti. The Japan Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center both analyzed Goni's \"T-index\" using the Dvorak technique, finding it to be 8.0, making it the first tropical cyclone since Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 to achieve a \"double T8.0\" rating.  \n\nAt its peak intensity, Goni made landfall in Catanduanes Province, Philippines, at 4:50 AM on November 1, and made a second landfall in Camarines Sur Province at 7:20 AM. Due to a sharp increase in vertical wind shear and the impact of the Philippine terrain, Goni rapidly weakened after landfall, with high- and low-level separation occurring. At 8 AM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded it to a typhoon, significantly reducing its wind speed from the peak of 170 knots to 130 knots. The Japan Meteorological Agency also reduced its wind speed to 90 knots. At 2 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center further reduced its wind speed to 75 knots, while the Japan Meteorological Agency reduced it to 80 knots. Simultaneously, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan downgraded it to a moderate typhoon. At 8 PM, the high- and low-level separation of Goni worsened, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to downgrade it to a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a severe tropical storm, reflecting Goni's rapid weakening from a super typhoon to a tropical storm in less than a day.  \n\nIn the early hours of November 2, Goni entered the South China Sea. At 2 AM, the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical storm, while the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan downgraded it to a mild typhoon. At 2 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded it to a tropical depression. However, six hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it back to a tropical storm.  \n\nAt 2 PM on November 6, the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression.

Guided by the subtropical ridge, the system moved northwestward, crossing waters with sea surface temperatures exceeding 29°C. However, it was suppressed by vertical wind shear, causing its convective cloud bands to be displaced to the northeast. Numerical forecasts predicted a low chance of development for the system. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center initially assessed its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low,\" upgraded it to \"medium\" at 9:30 p.m., and further to \"high\" at 11:30 p.m. on the 10th, issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert. Ultimately, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center briefly upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 5 a.m. on the 11th, designating it as tropical cyclone 12W, but issued its final warning just six hours later.

The typhoon reached \"strong\" intensity at 3 PM on October 7. Subsequently, after approaching Japan, it moved southward and transformed into a tropical depression near the Ogasawara Islands at 9 AM on October 12 (according to confirmed data, it transformed into a tropical depression at 3 AM on October 12 at 30.8 degrees north latitude and 142.2 degrees east longitude). This typhoon followed an unusual path, moving southward as if making a U-turn after coming quite close to Honshu. This is believed to have been influenced by factors such as the jet stream, a mobile high-pressure system, and the Pacific high-pressure system. It is thought that the typhoon could not ride the jet stream and was pushed southward, caught between high-pressure and low-pressure systems. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), headquartered in the UK, had predicted this unusual typhoon path in advance using a supercomputer."

Although there is no designated formation period, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to typhoons in the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2021 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) with international numbers starting with 21xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter W. Any tropical depression that enters or forms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility is given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). The Chinese names of storms are currently determined through consultation among the China Meteorological Administration, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. Before the 2020s, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan might have differed. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak state during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

In April, a rare typhoon formed in the Northwest Pacific and was named Surigae, which rapidly developed and became the third-lowest pressure tropical cyclone of the 21st century. In July, Typhoon In-fa and Typhoon Cempaka performed a \"double typhoon dance,\" with Cempaka intensifying near the coast, while In-fa indirectly caused the July 2021 Henan floods. In September, Typhoon Chanthu formed and was repeatedly rated as a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale; Typhoon Mindulle was nicknamed the \"aesthetic typhoon\" by typhoon enthusiasts. In October, Typhoons Lionrock, Kompasu, and Namtheun performed a \"triple typhoon dance,\" with Lionrock and Kompasu successively striking the southern coast of China, while Namtheun \"revived\" in the open ocean and intensified to typhoon strength. Entering winter, fewer cyclones formed compared to previous years, but all named cyclones developed into super typhoons, which was very rare. Super Typhoon Nyatoh explosively intensified to a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in high-latitude regions; Super Typhoon Rai first explosively intensified near the Philippines and made landfall in central Philippines at peak intensity. After crossing the Philippines and entering the South China Sea, it explosively intensified again in the central South China Sea, becoming the second tropical cyclone in the South China Sea to reach Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale."

On the evening of August 9, under the guidance of a deep subtropical high-pressure ridge to the north, the low-pressure area moved westward across the International Date Line, entering the Northwest Pacific, and the Japan Meteorological Agency took over issuing updates. On August 10 at 9:30 AM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its rating to \"high\" and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. At 2 PM, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression. Due to deep convection consolidating the low-level circulation center, at 8 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the tropical cyclone number 16W. Previously, the Madden-Julian Oscillation increased atmospheric instability, leading to the formation of multiple tropical cyclones. Subsequently, as the Madden-Julian Oscillation entered the next phase, subsiding air suppressed convection activity in the Western Pacific. The absence of the southwest monsoon, intrusion of dry air, and vertical wind shear from the southwest displacing convection eastward exposed the low-level circulation center. These unfavorable factors left the system struggling to survive on sea surface temperatures of 28°C or higher. On August 13 at 8 AM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center first upgraded it to a tropical storm. At 2 PM, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the number TD14. On August 14 at 2 AM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded it to a tropical depression, but at 2 PM, it was upgraded again to a tropical storm.

                "content": "At 9 PM on July 23, a developing tropical depression near Minamitorishima (formed at 9 AM on the same day) became Typhoon No. 8 and was named Nepartak. The typhoon then moved northward and proceeded northwest over the sea east of Japan. By 9 PM on the 24th, the radius of the strong wind area reached 500 km, making it a large typhoon. At this stage, it was feared that it could approach or make landfall in the Tohoku or Kanto-Koshin regions by the 27th. If it were to make landfall in areas such as Fukushima, Miyagi, or Ibaraki Prefectures, it would be the first such case since statistics began in 1951. Such a typhoon path is extremely rare, and since the start of statistics in 1951, only two typhoons had made landfall on the Pacific side of the Kanto-Tohoku region from the east: Typhoon No. 13 in 1989 (landed near Choshi City, Chiba Prefecture) and Typhoon No. 10 in 2016 (landed near Ofunato City, Iwate Prefecture). The unusual path of this typhoon was attributed to factors such as the Pacific High being located farther northeast than usual and the presence of an upper cold vortex. \n\nSubsequently, the typhoon gradually changed its course from northwest to west. Although it did not have a storm zone, parts of the Kanto and Tohoku regions entered the strong wind area on the night of the 26th. The typhoon temporarily moved southward and almost stalled east of Choshi City by the morning of the 27th. At this stage, parts of Hokuriku and Tokai also entered the strong wind area. During the day, it changed its course northward and moved off the southern coast of Kanto. By the night of the same day, it curved north-northwest and moved from off the coast of northern Kanto to off the coast of Sanriku. Later, before 6 AM on the 28th, it made landfall near Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture. As mentioned earlier, this was the first recorded instance of a typhoon making landfall in Miyagi Prefecture. It then moved northward through northeastern Miyagi Prefecture into Iwate Prefecture, reaching 70 km south of Morioka City by 9 AM and 80 km northeast of Akita City by noon on the same day. In the afternoon, it changed its course westward, passed through Akita Prefecture, and entered the Sea of Japan. At 3 PM on the same day, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of Akita Prefecture."

On the following day, July 27, a maximum wind gust of 25.8 m/s was recorded in Choshi, and Hachijojima experienced extremely heavy rainfall of 64.5 mm in one hour by 4:43 a.m., tying the record for the highest July observation. Additionally, heavy rainfall of 32.0 mm was observed in Higashishirakawa Town, Chiba Prefecture, by 1:11 a.m. that day. Later that night, active rain clouds brought strong rainfall to Minamisoma City, Fukushima Prefecture, with 21 mm of rain recorded in one hour by 8:00 p.m."

Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. In 2015, tropical storms formed in this region every month, marking the first time this occurred since the Japan Meteorological Agency began keeping records. \n\nThis article is limited to the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that formed in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are referred to as hurricanes and are included in the 2015 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that formed in the Northwest Pacific were named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) with international identification numbers starting with 15xx, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigned tropical depressions in this region identification numbers ending with the letter W.\n\nAny tropical depressions that entered or formed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility were given local names by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for local warning purposes, which could result in two different English names (with the international name being the official one). Additionally, since Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China use the same Chinese translations, while Taiwan may use different Chinese translations, a single storm could have two different Chinese names. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak intensity during its existence.\n\nThe tropical cyclones of the 2015 season were notably stronger, making it the season with the most super typhoons (13 in total) since the Hong Kong Observatory adopted a new tropical cyclone classification system in 2009, which added the categories of \"severe typhoon\" and \"super typhoon.\" It was also the first season to have four super typhoons before June."

He also mentioned that the typhoon season might begin in June or later. The Observatory planned to extend the forecast period for tropical cyclone tracks from 3 days to 5 days during the typhoon season of that year. However, the Director noted that due to the erratic movement of some tropical cyclones, the 5-day forecast would still have significant errors. On June 20, following the formation of Tropical Storm Kujira, the Observatory implemented the 5-day tropical cyclone track forecast. Affected by the El Niño phenomenon, after Typhoon Linfa directly hit Hong Kong in early July, there were nearly three months without any tropical cyclones affecting Hong Kong until early October, when Severe Typhoon Mujigae ended this rare lull. This not only marked the second consecutive year without storms hitting Hong Kong in August but also made it the first typhoon season since records began in 1946 where no storms affected Hong Kong in both August and September. As a result, on August 22, the Hong Kong Observatory revised the expected number of tropical cyclones entering the 500-kilometer range to 3 to 6, which is considered normal to slightly below normal."

Although Maysak's movement path followed the \"westward\" storm pattern typical of the Northwest Pacific typhoon season, moving from the Northwest Pacific through the Philippines into the South China Sea, this path generally occurs from June to October. Maysak taking this path in April was extremely rare. As a result, Maysak became the first storm since Typhoon Neoguri in 2008 to enter the northern South China Sea in April. At that time, the environment in the South China Sea was unfavorable for tropical cyclone development, and Maysak was ultimately weakened and dissipated in the northern South China Sea under the influence of the northeast monsoon, a situation similar to tropical cyclones entering the northern South China Sea in November."

The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression at 8 a.m. on December 9. Although the Northwest Pacific experienced over half a month of inactivity after Typhoon In-fa in November, with sea surface temperatures rising above 28 degrees Celsius, restoring a significant energy supply, the system's initial development was slow and disorganized due to strong vertical wind shear. By December 10, as wind shear weakened and upper-level divergence strengthened, the system began to develop deep convection, and a low-level circulation center formed. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning for the system at 8:45 p.m., predicting it would strengthen into a tropical storm within a day. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 1:30 p.m. the following day (December 11). However, half an hour later, the Japan Meteorological Agency officially upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it Melor and assigning it the international designation 1527. At that time, Melor was located approximately 50 kilometers south of Yap Island. This led the Hong Kong Observatory, which had not previously mentioned the system, to suddenly announce at 4:15 p.m. that \"the low-pressure area in the Northwest Pacific has intensified into a tropical depression and has been named Melor.\" The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also upgraded Melor in two consecutive advisories, first classifying it as a tropical depression at 11 p.m. and assigning it the tropical cyclone number 28W, then upgrading it to a tropical storm at 5 a.m. on December 12.

Although there is no specific formation period, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to typhoons in the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2021 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) with international numbers starting with 21xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter W. Any tropical depression that enters or forms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility is given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). The Chinese names for storms are currently determined through consultation among the China Meteorological Administration, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau, and the Central Weather Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. Before the 2020s, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan might have differed. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak form during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

Surigae rapidly developed and became the third-lowest pressure tropical cyclone of the 21st century. In July, Typhoon In-fa and Typhoon Cempaka performed a \"double typhoon dance,\" with Cempaka intensifying near the coast, while In-fa indirectly caused the July 2021 Henan floods. In September, Typhoon Chanthu formed and was repeatedly rated as a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, while Typhoon Mindulle was nicknamed the \"aesthetic typhoon\" by typhoon enthusiasts. In October, Typhoons Lionrock, Kompasu, and Namtheun performed a \"triple typhoon dance,\" with Lionrock and Kompasu successively striking the southern coast of China, while Namtheun \"revived\" in the open ocean and intensified to typhoon strength. Entering winter, fewer cyclones formed compared to previous years, but all named cyclones developed into super typhoons, which was very rare. Super Typhoon Nyatoh explosively intensified to Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in high-latitude regions, while Super Typhoon Rai first explosively intensified near the Philippines and made landfall in central Philippines at peak intensity. After crossing the Philippines and entering the South China Sea, it explosively intensified again in the central South China Sea, becoming the second tropical cyclone in the South China Sea to reach Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale."

On the evening of August 9, under the guidance of a deep subtropical high-pressure ridge to the north, the low-pressure area moved westward across the International Date Line into the Northwest Pacific, where the Japan Meteorological Agency took over issuing updates. On August 10 at 9:30 AM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its rating to \"high\" and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. At 2 PM, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression. Due to deep convection consolidating the low-level circulation center, at 8 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the tropical cyclone number 16W. Previously, the Madden-Julian Oscillation increased atmospheric instability, leading to the formation of multiple tropical cyclones. Subsequently, as the Madden-Julian Oscillation entered its next phase, subsiding airflows suppressed convection activity in the Western Pacific. The absence of the southwest monsoon, intrusion of dry air, and vertical wind shear from the southwest displacing convection eastward exposed the low-level circulation center. These unfavorable factors left the system struggling to survive on sea surface temperatures of 28°C or higher.

The typhoon is moving in a northeast direction while continuously absorbing \"Typhoon Agaton,\" moving away from the Philippines. The typhoon continued to rotate in the \"Pacific Ocean,\" initially moving slowly in the northeast direction, becoming a \"Severe Tropical Storm\" on April 11 and April 12 according to JTWC and JMA, until it fully developed into a \"Typhoon\" during the same period. It entered the PAR of the Philippines and was named Basyang by PAGASA at 10 AM (UTC+8) PST and slightly grazed the PAR before exiting the border of the PAR under the name Malakas within five (5) hours, as a Category 2 \"Typhoon.\" The name Malakas was replaced as it is derived from Greek homophones referred to it."

Although there is no designated formation period, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to typhoons in the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2022 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) with international numbers starting with 22xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter W. Any tropical depression that enters or forms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility is given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). The Chinese names of storms are currently determined through consultation by the China Meteorological Administration, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. Before the 2020s, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan might have differed. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak state during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

At the same time, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the designation TD09; the China Meteorological Administration also upgraded it to a tropical depression. At 5 p.m., the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau upgraded it to a tropical depression. At 9 p.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its rating to \"high\" and issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. \n\nAt 2 a.m. on August 9, the Hong Kong Observatory upgraded it to a tropical depression. At 8 a.m., the China Meteorological Administration was the first to upgrade it to a tropical storm. At 11 a.m., the Macao Meteorological Bureau upgraded it to a tropical storm. At 2 p.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm, assigned it the international designation 2207, and named it \"Mulan.\" At the same time, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded it to a mild typhoon; the Hong Kong Observatory also upgraded it to a tropical storm. \n\nAt around 10:50 a.m. on August 10, the China Meteorological Administration reported that Mulan made landfall along the coast of Xuwen County, Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province. At 9 p.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center canceled the tropical cyclone formation alert and downgraded its rating to \"medium.\" \n\nAt around 4:30 a.m. on August 11, the China Meteorological Administration reported that Mulan made landfall again along the northeastern coast of Vietnam. At 8 a.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression. At 8 p.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency removed the system from its weather map. It is worth noting that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center never recognized Mulan as a tropical cyclone and regarded it as a monsoon depression throughout."

It was expected that Typhoon Signal No. 3 would likely be issued during the day on August 9, and there was a moderate chance of issuing Typhoon Signal No. 8 on the evening of August 9. Typhoon Signal No. 1 was expected to remain in effect until the early morning of August 9. At 10:45 AM on August 9, the Meteorological Bureau announced that Typhoon Signal No. 3 would be issued at 11:30 AM, with a moderate chance of issuing Typhoon Signal No. 8. It was also expected that a blue storm surge warning would likely be issued between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM, while the chance of a yellow storm surge warning was low to moderate. At 11:30 AM, the Meteorological Bureau officially issued Typhoon Signal No. 3, which was expected to remain in effect during the day. At that time, \"Mulan\" was located about 630 kilometers south of Macau. At 2:00 PM, the Meteorological Bureau issued a blue storm surge warning, with a moderate to high chance of issuing Typhoon Signal No. 8. At 5:00 PM, the Meteorological Bureau predicted that Typhoon Signal No. 3 would remain in effect until before 9:00 PM and upgraded the storm surge warning from blue to yellow. It was noted that due to the astronomical high tide in the coming days, combined with the effects of the storm surge and continuous rainfall, flooding was expected in the Inner Harbor and low-lying areas from the early morning to the morning of August 10-11. The maximum flooding height on the morning of August 10 was expected to reach 0.5 to 1 meter. The Meteorological Bureau stated that as \"Mulan\" was gradually strengthening and might take a more northerly path closer to Macau, wind speeds could reach the lower limit of Typhoon Signal No. 8. The authorities would monitor the development of \"Mulan\" and local wind changes to decide whether to issue Typhoon Signal No. 8 during the evening or early morning. At 8:00 PM, the Meteorological Bureau predicted that Typhoon Signal No. 3 would remain in effect until before midnight. Later, at 11:00 PM, it was announced that Typhoon Signal No. 3 would remain in effect until before 4:00 AM on August 11. At 3:45 AM on August 10, the Meteorological Bureau announced that Typhoon Signal No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal would be issued at 7:00 AM. As \"Mulan\" was gradually strengthening and would be closest to Macau in the morning, wind speeds could reach the lower limit of Typhoon Signal No. 8. At 7:00 AM, the Meteorological Bureau officially issued Typhoon Signal No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal, which was expected to remain in effect during the morning. At that time, \"Mulan\" was located about 400 kilometers southwest of Macau. The Civil Protection Operations Center announced that Macau entered an immediate prevention state starting at 7:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, the Meteorological Bureau canceled all storm surge warnings. At 11:50 AM, the Meteorological Bureau announced that Typhoon Signal No. 3 would be issued at 1:00 PM. At 1:00 PM, the Meteorological Bureau officially issued Typhoon Signal No. 3, which was expected to remain in effect for some time. At that time, \"Mulan\" was located about 430 kilometers west-southwest of Macau. The Civil Protection Operations Center also announced the termination of the immediate prevention state starting at 1:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, the Meteorological Bureau stated that Typhoon Signal No. 3 was expected to remain in effect during the evening. At 8:00 PM, the Meteorological Bureau considered canceling all tropical cyclone warning signals within the next few hours. Starting around midnight, widespread heavy rain affected Macau due to the outer rainbands of \"Mulan.\" At 11:55 PM, the Meteorological Bureau issued a Yellow Rainstorm Warning Signal. At 12:30 AM on August 11, the Meteorological Bureau announced the cancellation of all tropical cyclone warning signals. At that time, \"Mulan\" was located about 530 kilometers west-southwest of Macau. The rainbands of \"Mulan\" continued to affect Macau, and at 1:35 AM, the Meteorological Bureau issued a Red Rainstorm Warning Signal, which was canceled at 3:00 AM. Later in the morning, Macau was again affected by the outer rainbands of \"Mulan,\" and the Meteorological Bureau issued a Yellow Rainstorm Warning Signal from 10:58 AM to 11:40 AM. The Geophysical and Meteorological Bureau stated that during the impact of \"Mulan\" on Macau, the 10-minute average wind speed recorded on the Friendship Bridge reached the lower limit of Typhoon Signal No. 8, classified as a weak Typhoon Signal No. 8. The authorities noted that \"Mulan\" developed from a monsoon depression into a tropical cyclone. Although its intensity increased, its structure was relatively loose, and its wind distribution differed from typical tropical cyclones, with weaker central winds and maximum winds located in its outer regions. The Pearl River Estuary was situated on the northeastern edge of the 7-8 wind scale area of \"Mulan's\" outer region. Additionally, during the period when Typhoon Signal No. 8 was in effect, most areas of Macau recorded over 30 millimeters of accumulated rainfall. The Meteorological Bureau stated that due to the recent astronomical high tide, combined with the effects of the storm surge and heavy rain, flooding occurred in the southern Inner Harbor area on the morning to noon of August 10, with a maximum flooding height of approximately 0.15 meters due to a slight time lag between the storm surge and the astronomical tide."

It stated that the No. 1 Signal would be maintained until 10 a.m. that morning, after which the issuance of the No. 3 Signal would be considered depending on changes in wind strength in Hong Kong. Affected by Mulan's outer rainbands, Hong Kong experienced squally showers and thunderstorms in the morning, with heavy rain at times and strong winds offshore and in highland areas. The Observatory predicted that winds across Hong Kong would strengthen further later in the day and announced at 7:45 a.m. that it would consider issuing the No. 3 Signal between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., depending on changes in local wind conditions. Subsequently, the Observatory issued the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 11:25 a.m., when Mulan was located about 580 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. It stated that the No. 3 Signal would remain in effect until at least 6 p.m., and whether a higher signal would be issued would depend on changes in Mulan's intensity and local wind conditions. \n\nIn the afternoon, strong winds were generally recorded across Hong Kong, with occasional gale-force gusts due to showers. Offshore and highland areas experienced winds reaching gale force at times. At 4:45 p.m., the Observatory stated that, as the gale-force wind area near Mulan's center was relatively small and it was still far from the Guangdong coast, the No. 3 Signal would remain in effect until 10 p.m. unless Mulan significantly intensified or took a path closer to Hong Kong. The Observatory would closely monitor Mulan's development and movement to assess the need for a higher signal. At 8:45 p.m., the Observatory announced that the No. 3 Signal would remain in effect until 2 a.m. the next day unless Mulan significantly intensified or there was a noticeable increase in wind strength in Hong Kong. It also noted that the next day (August 10) coincided with a high astronomical tide, and storm surges caused by Mulan could lead to flooding in low-lying areas in the morning. Residents were advised to take precautions against strong winds and flooding as early as possible. \n\nThe Observatory extended the duration of the No. 3 Signal to 6 a.m. and then to 12 p.m. on August 10, with announcements at 11:45 p.m. on August 9 and 4:45 a.m. on August 10, respectively. On the morning of August 10, strong winds continued to prevail across Hong Kong, with occasional gale-force winds offshore and in highland areas. At 9:45 a.m., the Observatory stated that the No. 3 Signal would remain in effect until at least 3 p.m., and the No. 1 Signal would be issued when there were signs of weakening winds in Hong Kong. At 11:45 a.m., the Observatory announced that the No. 3 Signal would remain in effect until at least 6 p.m. As winds in Hong Kong eased, the Observatory stated at 4:45 p.m. that it would consider issuing the No. 1 Signal or canceling all tropical cyclone warning signals between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. Ultimately, the Observatory canceled all tropical cyclone warning signals at 6:20 p.m., when Mulan was located about 540 kilometers west-southwest of Hong Kong. \n\nDuring Mulan's impact, three of the eight reference automatic weather stations in the Observatory's wind monitoring network recorded strong winds, with one station even recording gale-force winds. The No. 3 Signal was just one station short of meeting the criteria. Kai Tak narrowly missed recording strong winds. Cheung Chau, the airport, and Sai Kung recorded the highest 10-minute average wind speeds of 78, 50, and 46 kilometers per hour, respectively. In the early hours of August 10, trees fell in Kwun Tong and Chai Wan. At around 1 a.m., a tree approximately 6 meters tall fell at the junction of Hip Wo Street and Tsui Ping Road in Kwun Tong, lying across the traffic lanes. At around 2 a.m., a large tree on Cheung Tai Street in Chai Wan was suspected to have been blown down by strong winds, with its broken trunk crushing five private minibuses parked at a roadside car park. Firefighters and police were dispatched to handle the situation. Additionally, at 3 p.m., an iron rod fell from the sky in Cha Kwo Ling Village, striking three workers on the ground. Two of them were seriously injured and unconscious, while the other was injured and trapped."

Affected by this, the strong winds brought by the typhoon will cause the Qiongzhou Strait to suspend navigation, and as Hainan Province is currently experiencing a local COVID-19 outbreak, it will have a certain impact on the transportation, storage, and supply of epidemic prevention materials and daily necessities. Additionally, the wind and rain will affect the smooth progress of outdoor prevention and control work, increasing the difficulty of nucleic acid sampling and temporary road control work. Cai Qinbo, deputy director of the Hainan Meteorological Bureau, stated that while ensuring epidemic prevention, relevant units should strengthen safety inspections and handling of potential hazards. Chen Wu, deputy director of the Hainan Emergency Management Department and deputy director of the Provincial Three Defense Office, stated that Hainan has integrated typhoon preparedness with grassroots epidemic prevention work, and the province's supply and storage of daily necessities are sufficient, with prices remaining basically stable."

At 9:45 a.m., the Observatory stated that the No. 3 Signal would be maintained at least until 3 p.m., and the No. 1 Signal would be issued when there were signs of weakening winds in Hong Kong. At 11:45 a.m., the Observatory announced that the No. 3 Signal would be maintained at least until 6 p.m. As winds in Hong Kong eased, the Observatory stated at 4:45 p.m. that it would consider issuing the No. 1 Signal or canceling all tropical cyclone warning signals between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. Ultimately, the Observatory canceled all tropical cyclone warning signals at 6:20 p.m., when Mulan was located about 540 kilometers west-southwest of Hong Kong. \n\nDuring Mulan's impact, three of the eight reference automatic weather stations in the Observatory's wind measurement network recorded strong winds, with one station even recording gale-force winds. The No. 3 Signal was just one station short of meeting the criteria. Kai Tak narrowly missed recording strong winds. Cheung Chau, the airport, and Sai Kung recorded the highest 10-minute average wind speeds of 78, 50, and 46 kilometers per hour, respectively. In the early hours of August 10, trees fell in Kwun Tong and Chai Wan. At around 1 a.m., a tree approximately 6 meters tall fell at the junction of Hip Wo Street and Tsui Ping Road in Kwun Tong, lying across the traffic lanes. At around 2 a.m., a large tree on Cheung Tai Street in Chai Wan was suspected to have been blown down by strong winds, with its broken trunk crushing five private minibuses parked at a roadside car park. Firefighters and police were dispatched to handle the situation. Additionally, at 3 p.m., an iron rod fell from the sky in Cha Kwo Ling Village, striking three workers on the ground. Two of them were seriously injured and unconscious, while the other was injured and trapped."

Affected by this, the strong winds brought by the typhoon will cause the Qiongzhou Strait to suspend navigation, and as Hainan Province is currently experiencing a local COVID-19 outbreak, it will have a certain impact on the transportation, storage, and supply of epidemic prevention materials and daily necessities. Additionally, the wind and rain will affect the smooth progress of outdoor prevention and control work, increasing the difficulty of nucleic acid sampling and temporary road control work. Cai Qinbo, deputy director of the Hainan Meteorological Bureau, stated that while ensuring epidemic prevention, relevant units should strengthen safety inspections and handling of potential hazards. Chen Wu, deputy director of the Hainan Emergency Management Department and deputy director of the Provincial Three Defense Office, stated that Hainan has already integrated typhoon preparedness with grassroots epidemic prevention work, and the province's supply and storage of daily necessities are sufficient, with prices remaining basically stable."

[47] Due to the previous impact of heatwaves, the provincial capital Nanning had experienced drought and high-temperature weather; after \"Mulan\" made landfall in Guangdong, the rainfall brought by the typhoon circulation also caused the local daytime temperature to drop from about 35 degrees Celsius on August 9 [48] to about 25 degrees Celsius on August 10 [49]. To alleviate the drought, the Meteorological Bureau of Yongning District, Nanning, also took the opportunity of the typhoon's outer circulation cloud system passing through on August 10 to carry out artificial rainfall operations.

Although there is no designated formation period, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to typhoons in the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2022 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) with international numbers starting with 22xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter W. Any tropical depression that enters or forms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility is given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). The Chinese names of storms are currently determined through consultation among the China Meteorological Administration, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. Before the 2020s, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan might have differed. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak form during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

However, most tropical cyclones tend to form between May and November. These are the conventional periods that define the timeframe during which most tropical cyclones form annually in the Northwest Pacific. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific, the area north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms forming east of the International Date Line and north of the equator belong to the 2001 Northeast Pacific Hurricane Season. Tropical storms forming across the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Tropical depressions tracked by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are assigned a \"W\" suffix after their identification number. Tropical depressions forming or moving into areas monitored by the Philippines are also named by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). This is why, in many cases, a storm may have two different names."

Subsequently, a low-pressure trough forced Chebi to move northward, making landfall near Fuzhou, China. The storm weakened over land and then accelerated northeastward, passing through southeastern Shanghai before returning to the sea. The JMA and several weather centers ceased issuing advisories on June 30 as Chebi's remnants completely dissipated over the eastern Pacific Ocean."

Subsequently, cold water and upper-level wind shear weakened the storm until it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the 25th. Faxai, the strongest storm of the typhoon season and one of the strongest Northwest Pacific typhoons ever recorded in December, remained offshore and did not impact land. Initially, the JTWC believed that Faxai and Tropical Depression 31W were the same system. However, later analyses determined that 31W was an entirely separate storm. As a result, after reanalysis, Faxai was assigned a new designation of 33W by the JTWC (32W was Typhoon Vamei)."

By December 29, Vamei entered the Indian Ocean as a tropical depression, then re-intensified before dissipating on January 1, 2002.

However, due to the unprecedented nature of the situation, a relief and rescue headquarters was established at the prefectural office, and a branch office was set up in Kanoya Town. A medical relief team was formed with members from the Kagoshima Prefectural Hospital and the Prefectural Medical Association. On the same day, a maritime team was dispatched to Uchinoura on the police ship \"Asahi Sakura,\" accompanied by the medical relief team. A land team was dispatched to Kanoya. After the situation became clear, the 45th Infantry Regiment from Kagoshima was deployed on the 20th, and the Kumamoto Engineering Corps was deployed on the 21st. The funding was covered by national subsidies, the prefecture's recovery and reconstruction budget, and donations collected from across the country. River improvement by the national government had begun in 1937, the year before the flood, but it was fully implemented after the disaster. The river improvement included straightening the meandering Kimotsuki River and constructing embankments. According to the Osumi River and National Highway Office, even if rainfall of the same scale were to occur, flooding is not expected. However, during Typhoon No. 24 in 2018, tributaries temporarily exceeded the flood danger level, indicating that unforeseen situations are possible."

It developed while moving northwestward, and by November 22, it had intensified into a typhoon of \"strong\" intensity. However, forecasting agencies predicted that the typhoon would make landfall in Vietnam and dissipate in the inland regions of Vietnam. Contrary to these predictions, the typhoon began to stall over the eastern sea of Vietnam starting November 23. While repeatedly moving southwestward, northwestward, and eastward, the typhoon eventually began to move eastward from the night of November 24, and by November 27, it struck the southern part of Luzon Island in the Philippines. During this process, the typhoon significantly weakened, and after moving out to the eastern sea of the Philippines, it soon dissipated. This typhoon exhibited an unusual trajectory, moving westward, stalling, and then reversing its course 180 degrees to move eastward. The reason for this trajectory was that the typhoon stalled under the influence of a cold continental high-pressure system to the northwest, and as it approached within 1,000 km of Typhoon Mitag, which was located over the eastern sea of the Philippines, the Fujiwhara effect occurred, where two tropical cyclones in close proximity influence each other's paths. As a result, \"Hagibis\" moved eastward, while \"Mitag\" moved westward."

Later that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified this system as a tropical depression. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert.\n\nThe following day, the JMA began issuing regular advisories on this depression. The system slowly strengthened, resulting in a second tropical cyclone formation alert issued by the JTWC later that day, local time. In this second alert, the JTWC noted that the system had a well-defined strengthening surface air circulation. By 12:00 UTC on May 16, the JTWC also classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W, based on QuikSCAT satellite estimates. On the morning of May 17, the JMA classified the depression as Tropical Storm Yutu. The name Yutu was given by China and refers to a rabbit in a Chinese fable. Three hours later, the JTWC also classified the depression as a tropical storm. On May 18, Yutu changed its course to the northwest and entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). At the same time, the JMA classified Yutu as a severe tropical storm. The Philippine agency named the storm \"Amang.\" Later that day, the JTWC classified Yutu as a typhoon and identified a distinct eye in satellite images. At 18:00 UTC, the JMA also classified the storm as a typhoon as Yutu continued to intensify. It began moving toward Iwo Jima, undergoing rapid intensification, with air currents heading north and little vertical wind shear.\n\nOn the night of May 20, Yutu reached its peak intensity as a strong typhoon equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, shortly after the JTWC classified it as a super typhoon. Despite being over cooler waters, its strong northward air currents helped it maintain its strength, with its eye measuring 20 km in diameter on the morning of May 21. The typhoon began to gradually weaken, passing over Okinotorishima and near Iwo Jima that day as it accelerated northeastward. Winds of 122 km/h were recorded in Iwo Jima around 15:00 UTC, with gusts of 192 km/h. At that time, atmospheric pressure of 976 mbar was recorded on the island. Yutu then began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, and the JTWC issued its final advisory on the morning of May 22. The JMA issued its last advisory after the system had already transformed into an extratropical cyclone the following day. In post-storm analyses, the JTWC increased the peak intensity to maximum sustained winds of 240 km/h. Thus, Yutu was classified by the JTWC as a super typhoon."

                "content": "Typhoon Vamco (international designation: 0910; JTWC designation: 11W) was an intense tropical cyclone that spent its entire lifespan moving northward in the northwest Pacific Ocean in mid-August 2009. Vamco formed from an area of meteorological disturbances just north of the Marshall Islands on August 16 and became a tropical storm the following day. With favorable weather conditions, Vamco intensified into a severe tropical storm on August 18 according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and into a typhoon on August 19. From then on, Vamco began to undergo rapid intensification, reaching its peak intensity on August 21, with maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), or 185 km/h according to the JMA. From that point, Vamco began to gradually weaken as it gained more latitude and started transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August 25, when the JTWC issued its final advisory on the system. The JMA maintained regular advisories on Vamco for the remainder of that day and downgraded it to a severe tropical storm. The JMA also issued its final advisory on the system in the early hours (UTC) of August 26. Vamco did not directly impact any coastal regions while in its tropical phase. However, the strong swells caused by the typhoon indirectly triggered rip currents and surf in the Northern Mariana Islands. Vamco also reached eastern Alaska as an extratropical cyclone, causing moderate rainfall and winds exceeding 80 km/h. However, there are no reports of significant impacts associated with the typhoon."

                "content": "Typhoon Vamco formed from an area of meteorological disturbances that persisted north of Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands, and began showing signs of organization on August 13. Initially, a low-level cyclonic circulation was present within a trough of narrow barometric gradients. The low-level cyclonic circulation within this trough was slowly organizing with the formation of new convection areas, aided by favorable upper-level outflows driven by the presence of a tropical upper tropospheric trough to its northwest. Additionally, wind shear in the region was low, and the warm ocean waters were highly conducive to its intensification. The disturbance moved westward in the following days, and on August 16, the system had already shown sufficient organization for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), the United States Navy's tropical cyclone monitoring agency, to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system, indicating that the disturbance could become a significant tropical cyclone within 12 to 24 hours. Later that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the meteorological agency designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for monitoring tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, classified the disturbance as a weak tropical depression. The system continued to organize, and the JMA upgraded the depression to a full tropical depression in the early hours (UTC) of August 17. A few hours later, the system's low-level cyclonic circulation already had maximum sustained winds of 55 km/h, prompting the JTWC to also classify the system as a tropical depression, assigning it the designation \"11W.\" The system moved almost directly north throughout its lifecycle due to the presence of a strong subtropical high to its northeast. Later that afternoon (UTC), the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm. At that time, upper-level outflows were aiding the production of new convection areas and consequently intensifying the cyclone; these outflows were being established by the presence of a tropical upper tropospheric trough, as well as the formation of a mesoscale anticyclone over the system. A few hours later, the JMA also classified the system as a tropical storm, naming it \"Vamco,\" a name submitted to the typhoon naming list by Vietnam, referring to a river in the southern part of the country. From the early hours (UTC) of August 18, Vamco began to consolidate further as its outflows became more defined. Gradually intensifying that day, Vamco became a severe tropical storm, according to the JMA, later that day. In the early hours of August 19, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Vamco to a typhoon as the system acquired more upper-level outflows, forming new areas of deep convection as a result. From that morning, Vamco began undergoing rapid intensification, and an eye, approximately 18 km in diameter, began forming within its convection areas. Additionally, Vamco's movement was nearly stationary, as the same tropical upper tropospheric trough providing favorable outflows weakened the dominant subtropical high. As a result, the atmospheric anticyclonic movement in that region was nearly halted. Vamco continued to intensify until the early hours of August 20. From then on, its intensity remained stable, with maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h. Vamco maintained its stable intensity until the morning (UTC) of August 21, when it began to intensify again. At that time, Vamco presented itself as a typical intense tropical cyclone, with a well-defined eye surrounded by intense areas of deep convection. At that time, Vamco reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h. However, from that afternoon, Vamco began to weaken slowly due to a slight deterioration in upper-level outflows caused by the approach of a mid-latitude trough. From August 22, Vamco's maximum wind radius began to shrink with the loss of deep convection areas. However, Vamco was able to maintain its stable intensity at 175 km/h during that day. But from that night, Vamco's eye began to disappear, along with the deep convection areas, due to the intrusion of drier air into the typhoon's cyclonic circulation. The typhoon's eye reappeared during the early hours of August 23 as Vamco managed to maintain its intensity at 165 km/h, even under the effects of the drier air, which began to sever the typhoon's connection to the tropical air mass to its south. Vamco began accelerating northward during the afternoon of August 23 as the subtropical high to its east began to intensify, thereby increasing atmospheric circulation. During the morning of August 24, Vamco's eye diameter increased more than fourfold, and the typhoon became an annular cyclone, characterized by a slow response to external influences. That night (UTC), Vamco began moving more northeastward as it reached the northwestern edge of the subtropical high and began to be influenced by westerly winds. In the early morning of August 25, Vamco began interacting with the baroclinic zone, a typical mid-latitude area where the atmosphere is highly unstable. In the region, wind shear was strong, which began to separate the typhoon's low-level cyclonic circulation from its upper-level circulation. Additionally, Vamco began undergoing extratropical transition at that time, meaning Vamco began transforming into an extratropical cyclone. As a result, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Vamco on the morning of August 25 as the typhoon began exhibiting frontal characteristics, such as the formation of an associated cold front and warm front, indicating that the extratropical transition was well underway. Furthermore, its eye disappeared, and its deep convection areas rapidly declined as the cyclone moved into cooler waters. However, the JMA still maintained Vamco as a tropical cyclone for the remainder of that day and downgraded it to a severe tropical storm around noon (UTC). In the early hours of August 26, the JMA also issued its final advisory on Vamco as the cyclone completed its extratropical transition."

Residents of Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan were warned about the possible arrival of a severe storm over the islands and to check their emergency plans in case a severe storm hit the islands. However, Vamco moved northward for most of its lifespan and did not directly affect the islands. Nevertheless, the strong swells caused by the typhoon generated high surf and strong rip currents on these islands. After Vamco became an extratropical cyclone, the system reached the Aleutian Islands, causing moderate rain and winds of up to 85 km/h."

The name \"Talim\" (Tagalog: Talim) was provided by the Philippines and means sharp and pointed. Talim developed from a low-pressure center associated with a trough. Before Talim formed, the coast of South China was affected by a trough; as the trough gradually weakened in the northern South China Sea, a low-pressure area less than 100 kilometers southeast of Hainan Island developed into Tropical Cyclone Talim. Talim was one of the few tropical cyclones to move eastward in the South China Sea, advancing eastward from Hainan under the guidance of the equatorial anticyclone, eventually weakening and dissipating after moving through the Taiwan Strait to the East China Sea. In its early stages, Talim exhibited characteristics of a \"monsoon depression,\" with stronger winds on the outside and weaker winds on the inside, causing occasional strong winds along the South China coast. However, as Talim intensified, the monsoon depression characteristics disappeared, and the Hong Kong Observatory issued the first No. 3 tropical cyclone warning signal of the year for Talim, but after the signal was issued, wind speeds unexpectedly decreased instead of increasing."

At 9:10 AM on June 17, the Hong Kong Observatory stated that a low-pressure area east of Hainan Island was \"gradually intensifying into a tropical depression.\" At 10:45 AM on the same day, the Hong Kong Observatory officially upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression, which was located about 480 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong at the time. At 4:25 PM, the Hong Kong Observatory reported that the tropical depression had slightly intensified in the afternoon and began moving in an easterly direction. At 7:30 PM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, upgrading it to a High rating, predicting that the tropical disturbance would move northeast or east-northeast, approaching the Taiwan Strait. Later in the evening, the China Meteorological Administration upgraded it to a tropical storm. In the early hours of June 18, the Japan Meteorological Agency also upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm and named it Talim. At 4:00 AM, the Macao Meteorological Bureau upgraded Talim to a tropical storm. At 4:45 AM, the Hong Kong Observatory also upgraded Talim to a tropical storm. At 10:45 PM, the Hong Kong Observatory upgraded Talim to a severe tropical storm. Starting June 18, the storm's northward component increased. At 8:00 AM on June 19, the Macao Meteorological Bureau upgraded Talim to a severe tropical storm.

The Hong Kong Observatory issued the No. 1 Standby Signal at 4:20 p.m. that same afternoon, with Talim located about 470 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. At 8:45 p.m. that evening, the Observatory stated that it would consider issuing the No. 3 Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal the following morning and unusually urged parents to pay attention to weather information before sending their children to school.\n\nOn June 18, Talim continued to move slowly, gradually entering within 400 kilometers of Hong Kong. The Observatory delayed the issuance of the No. 3 Signal to later in the morning and later stated that \"the chance of issuing the No. 3 Signal this morning is not high.\" At 2:00 p.m., the Observatory issued another \"Special Weather Alert,\" stating that it would consider issuing the No. 3 Signal between 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.; however, as Talim remained stationary between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., the Observatory further delayed the issuance of the No. 3 Signal, stating that the chance of issuing the No. 3 Signal in the evening was quite high. At 10:40 p.m. that evening, the Observatory issued the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal, with Talim located about 360 kilometers south of Hong Kong and having strengthened into a severe tropical storm. The Observatory stated that the No. 3 Signal would be maintained for some time; however, at 7:45 a.m., the Observatory stated that Hong Kong would turn to northerly winds, which would be blocked by terrain, and it would consider replacing the No. 3 Signal with the No. 1 Signal in the next few hours. At 10:20 a.m., the Observatory replaced the No. 3 Signal with the No. 1 Standby Signal, with Talim located about 300 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. However, after replacing the No. 1 Signal, Talim continued to approach Hong Kong.\n\nTalim came closest to Hong Kong at 5:00 p.m. on June 19, passing about 260 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. The Observatory canceled all tropical cyclone warning signals at 8:40 p.m. that evening, with Talim located about 270 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. On June 20, under the influence of the northwesterly continental airflow associated with Talim, the weather in Hong Kong was extremely hot, with the Observatory recording a maximum temperature of 33 degrees Celsius. The Observatory issued a Very Hot Weather Warning at 8:45 a.m. that day and canceled it at 11:00 p.m. the same day.\n\nDuring the storm, only one of the eight designated automatic weather stations in the Observatory's wind measurement network recorded strong winds, and the No. 3 Signal did not meet the standard; Cheung Chau recorded the highest 10-minute average wind speed of 48 kilometers per hour."

This led the Observatory to believe that the winds would persist and continue to strengthen. However, the winds eased before midnight, and there was no significant increase in wind strength in the early hours of June 18. Coupled with Typhoon Talim's continued eastward movement, the Observatory decided not to upgrade to the No. 3 typhoon signal in the early morning.\n\nThroughout June 18, the Observatory's tropical cyclone updates in the early morning, morning, and afternoon consistently mentioned the possibility of upgrading to the No. 3 signal in the next period. This was due to intermittent strong winds on the three major bridges, sustained moderate winds in urban areas, and Typhoon Talim's continued eastward trajectory, which made the Observatory cautious about making any hasty decisions.\n\nFrom the early morning to the morning of June 19, Macau's wind conditions showed no significant changes, and Typhoon Talim's trajectory continued to shift eastward. As a result, the Observatory stated that the likelihood of upgrading to the No. 3 signal in the morning was low. They also announced in the morning that the No. 1 signal would remain in effect until the evening, indicating a very low chance of upgrading to the No. 3 signal. However, by the evening, Typhoon Talim's trajectory began to shift northward, prompting the Observatory to refrain from lowering all typhoon signals that night. Later in the evening, Typhoon Talim's trajectory shifted northeastward, leading the Observatory to extend the No. 1 signal until 4 a.m. on June 20.\n\nThis marked the first time since Tropical Cyclone Nalgae that the Observatory, citing \"actual conditions,\" decided not to upgrade to a higher typhoon signal for a tropical cyclone."

The deputy director of the Weather Forecast Center mentioned that Typhoon Talim had three characteristics: \"occurring during the plum rain season,\" \"forming in the South China Sea,\" and \"moving northeastward,\" making it the first case recorded by the Central Weather Bureau since 1948. [8][9] Due to concerns about introducing a southwest airflow and causing extremely heavy rainfall, the media compared it to the 1987 and 1972 floods. [10][11][12] At 5:30 a.m. on June 19, 2012, the Central Weather Bureau issued a sea typhoon warning, followed by a land and sea typhoon warning at 8:30 p.m. the same day. \n\nDue to the storm's impact, the Central Weather Bureau issued a land and sea typhoon warning, and the Directorate-General of Personnel Administration of the Executive Yuan announced the suspension of work and classes on its website. The following areas met the criteria for suspension: [13] On June 20, based on the 10th report from the Weather Bureau, the Taiwan Railways Administration predicted that all regions in Taiwan should take strict precautions against strong winds and heavy rain. The South Link Line began suspending operations gradually from 11:02 a.m., and the Western Main Line from 1:17 p.m., to ensure passenger safety. \n\nIn the early morning of June 21, as Typhoon Talim continued to weaken and moved away from the northern sea of Taiwan at a speed of at least 30 kilometers per hour, the Central Weather Bureau lifted the land typhoon warning at 2:30 a.m. and the sea typhoon warning at 5:30 a.m. Due to its rapid movement, the Weather Bureau revised the estimated rainfall for June 20 to half of the original forecast, which drew criticism and complaints from the public about the \"inaccuracy\" of the Central Weather Bureau's predictions.

It transformed into a tropical depression less than four hours after landfall. Although the typhoon was small in scale, a linear rainband formed near the Tanzawa Mountains in Kanagawa Prefecture, causing significant damage in Oyama Town, Suntō District, Shizuoka Prefecture. Notably, Tanzawa Lake recorded 489.5 mm of rainfall in five hours by 4 p.m. on September 8, which is said to be 1.6 times the average rainfall for September. This typhoon became the first on record to make landfall in Fukui Prefecture since statistics began in 1951, and it also marked the first typhoon landfall in the Hokuriku region as a whole. Due to the significant damage in Oyama Town, Shizuoka Prefecture, and Yamakita Town, Kanagawa Prefecture, it was decided to designate the event as a severe disaster (localized severe disaster)."

It moved north-northeast over the sea east of the Nansei Islands, gradually changing direction to the north-northwest, and reached its peak around 9 a.m. on the 14th south of Yakushima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture, recording a central pressure of 960 hPa. It then made landfall near Shibushi Bay in Kagoshima Prefecture around 9 p.m. on the 15th. Around 3 a.m. on the 16th, it moved out to the Yatsushiro Sea and advanced to the sea west of Nagasaki Prefecture, where it stalled west of Tsushima in Nagasaki Prefecture on the 17th. It began moving east on the 18th and dissipated near Wakasa Bay in Fukui Prefecture on the 19th [1]. Due to the typhoon's impact, the total rainfall in Saga Prefecture reached 493.9 mm, and heavy rains of 200–400 mm occurred in Kyushu, causing damage in various parts of Kyushu, including Saga Prefecture [1]. Additionally, the heavy rains caused frequent river flooding in various areas of Kyushu and Shikoku, resulting in a major flood disaster. On September 1, 1949, Emperor Showa and Empress Kojun granted relief funds to Saga Prefecture, Miyazaki Prefecture, Fukuoka Prefecture, and Nagasaki Prefecture, which were heavily affected [2]."

It made a second landfall near Uwajima City in Ehime Prefecture around 3:00 AM on September 15, traversed Shikoku, and made a third landfall near Akashi City in Hyogo Prefecture around 10:00 AM the same day. It then moved from the Kinki region through the Chubu region and transitioned into a tropical depression near Iida City in Nagano Prefecture at 3:00 PM on September 15 [1]. \n\nExamples of tropical depressions that were upgraded to typhoons in sea areas close to land, like this typhoon, include Typhoon No. 11 in 2004 and Typhoon No. 9 in 2009. Meanwhile, a stationary front lingered near Honshu during this period, and as the typhoon moved northward, the activity of the front also intensified, resulting in heavy rainfall over a wide area from the Tohoku region to the Kyushu region. The total precipitation during this period reached 519 mm in Hirugano, Takasu Village, Gifu Prefecture, and ranged from 300 to 450 mm in parts of Gifu Prefecture, Oita Prefecture, Kochi Prefecture, and Tokushima Prefecture. This heavy rainfall caused significant damage, including the flooding of the Nagara River, particularly in Gifu Prefecture [1]."

The typhoon initially moved northeast and was expected to weaken and transition into an extratropical cyclone, but it suddenly began moving southward, rode the easterly winds westward, and redeveloped. At one point, its intensity had weakened to a central pressure of 975 hPa and a maximum wind speed of 30 m/s (60 kt), but it regained strength to a central pressure of 935 hPa and a maximum wind speed of 45 m/s (90 kt). It then followed the same route northeast again and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. At its peak intensity, the central pressure was 930 hPa, and the maximum wind speed was 50 m/s (95 kt). This typhoon followed such an unusual path because it circled the edge of the Pacific High over the course of about a week. Due to this complex path, the southward movement of this typhoon spanned 8.9 degrees in latitude, ranking first since records began in 1951, and its total travel distance ranked as the third longest in history. Such a typhoon had not occurred in the past several decades, and despite causing no damage to Japan as it circled the Pacific, it became a famous typhoon."

After moving north over the eastern sea of Minamidaitojima on the 27th, the typhoon changed its course to north-northeast, accelerated, and moved north off the coast of Shikoku before making landfall in southern Wakayama Prefecture at 7:30 PM on the 29th. At the time of landfall, the typhoon remained strong, with a central pressure of 950 hPa and a maximum wind speed of 40 m/s. The typhoon crossed from the Kinki region to the western Hokuriku region and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan by 3 PM on the 30th.  \n\nDue to this typhoon, the daily rainfall on the 29th reached 733 mm at Mount Hinode in Kamikitayama Village, Nara Prefecture, 449 mm in Miyagawa, Miyagawa Village, Mie Prefecture, and 374 mm in Yanase, Umaji Village, Kochi Prefecture, resulting in heavy rainfall exceeding 300 mm, particularly on the southeastern slopes of Shikoku and the Kii Peninsula. On the same day, a maximum wind speed of 34.1 m/s (maximum instantaneous wind speed of 48.7 m/s) was recorded in Tsu City, Mie Prefecture, and along the Pacific coast from Shikoku to Hokkaido, there were areas where maximum wind speeds exceeded 20 m/s. On the 29th, a significant wave height of 6.61 m was observed in Sakihama, Kochi Prefecture.  \n\nStrong winds caused building damage, particularly in the Tokai and Kinki regions. Additionally, Kansai International Airport, which had just opened on September 4 of the same year, was closed for the first time due to this typhoon. Furthermore, two large tankers under construction at Nippon Kokan Tsu Shipyard (now Universal Shipbuilding) were swept away and drifted ashore, grounding near Gotenba Beach.  \n\nThis typhoon resulted in 3 fatalities, 62 injuries, 18 completely destroyed houses, 167 partially destroyed houses, and 569 houses flooded above floor level."

For example, it discusses the number of typhoons that occurred, their impact on Japan (approaches and landfalls), and whether there were any notable typhoons. It also mentions whether the number of occurrences, landfalls, or approaches to Japan was average, above average, or below average compared to normal years. Additionally, if there were typhoons during that year's typhoon season that caused significant impact or severe damage to Japan, typhoons that set records for early or late occurrence, typhoons that developed into record-breaking strength or size, long-lasting typhoons, or rare crossing typhoons, these are also briefly mentioned. Furthermore, if there were typhoons that caused significant damage to countries or regions outside Japan and attracted global attention, these are also added.\n\n[Example: Opening part of the 2013 typhoon article]  \n[Note 1] Data on typhoons in 2013 (tropical cyclones that occurred in the Northwest Pacific).  \nTyphoon No. 1 occurred as early as January 3, marking the sixth earliest occurrence since statistics began in 1951. Up until August, the number of occurrences was average, but in September and October, seven typhoons occurred each month, exceeding the average. As a result, the total number of typhoons reached 31 (average value: 25.6), surpassing 30 in a year for the first time in 19 years since 1994. The seven typhoons that occurred in October were the highest since 1951, tying with 1984 and 1992.  \n\nFourteen typhoons approached Japan from Typhoon No. 3 in June to Typhoon No. 28 in October, with two making landfall (both in September). This number of landfalls was slightly below the average (2.7), but there were many typhoons approaching the mainland in autumn, with six in October alone, the highest on record.  \n\nAdditionally, two consecutive crossing typhoons (No. 13 and No. 14), which are said to occur once in 100 cases, crossed the 180-degree longitude line.  \n\nTyphoon No. 18, which made landfall in Aichi Prefecture in September, prompted the first issuance of a special warning, which began operation in August of the same year.  \n\nTyphoon No. 26, which approached the Kanto region in October, caused a landslide due to heavy rain on Izu Oshima in the Izu Islands, resulting in significant damage.  \n\nIn November, Typhoon No. 30 became a \"super typhoon,\" directly hitting the Philippines, causing record-breaking storm surges, and resulting in over 6,000 fatalities and extensive damage."

Regarding section headings, even for notable typhoons to which the Japan Meteorological Agency later assigned a unique name, such as the Isewan Typhoon (international name: Vera), the unique name is not used as the section heading. Instead, the aforementioned rules are followed. For the Isewan Typhoon, the heading would be \"Typhoon No. 15 (Vera)\" rather than \"Isewan Typhoon.\" Additionally, if there is an individual article about the typhoon, a link to that article is provided.

It is rare for a typhoon to make landfall in June even in the Kyushu region, but in 1997, Typhoon No. 7 had also made landfall in Gamagori City, Aichi Prefecture, just eight days earlier, resulting in two typhoons making landfall in June. The occurrence of two typhoons making landfall in June is rare, with only two instances recorded in statistics since 1951: in 1997 and 2004."

The typhoon made landfall near Anan City, Tokushima Prefecture, with a central pressure of 970 hPa and strong intensity after 5 p.m. on July 26. It then passed through Harima-nada and made a second landfall near Bizen City, Okayama Prefecture, before crossing the Chugoku region before 9 p.m. on the same day. On July 27, it stalled over the Sea of Japan off the San'in region and became a tropical depression in the same area at 6 a.m. on July 28. This tropical depression exhibited complex movements, moving southward from the western Hokuriku region to the Tokai region between the night of July 28 and the morning of July 29, and dissipated over the southern seas of the Kii Peninsula on July 31. Due to this typhoon and tropical depression, heavy rain occurred in areas such as the Tokai, Kinki, Shikoku, and Chugoku regions. Particularly in the Kii Peninsula, torrential rain centered on July 26 resulted in a total precipitation of 958 mm at Mount Hinode in Kamikitayama Village, Nara Prefecture, and 600–800 mm in mountainous areas. Daily precipitation reached 734 mm at Mount Hinode and 612 mm in Miyagawa Village, Mie Prefecture. Additionally, total precipitation exceeded 500 mm in parts of Hiroshima and Shimane Prefectures, and over 100 mm of rain fell in northern Kanto. On July 26, winds of around 20 m/s blew from the Shikoku region to the Tokai region, with a maximum wind speed of 26.6 m/s (maximum instantaneous wind speed of 35.4 m/s) recorded in Tsu City, Mie Prefecture, 37.5 m/s (maximum instantaneous wind speed of 52.2 m/s) at Cape Muroto in Muroto City, Kochi Prefecture, 38.2 m/s maximum instantaneous wind speed in Kobe City, and 33.9 m/s maximum instantaneous wind speed in Osaka City. On the same day, a significant wave height of 8.73 m was observed in Sakihama, Kochi Prefecture, marking the highest record since observations began in 1977. Furthermore, as the typhoon moved into the Sea of Japan, the foehn phenomenon occurred, resulting in extreme heat on the Sea of Japan side, including the Hokuriku region."

Around August 5, the typhoon changed its course toward the Kanto region, and at around 3:00 PM on August 9, it made landfall near Choshi City, Chiba Prefecture. By this time, its strength had weakened compared to its peak, and although it still maintained a storm zone, it was no longer a large-scale typhoon.

By 9 AM on August 7, it had developed into Typhoon No. 7 (Polly) at 24°2'N, 155°6'E near Minamitorishima. The typhoon moved northwest toward the Japanese archipelago, reaching the southern seas of Honshu by 3 AM on August 11. It then slowly moved southwest, approaching Tokunoshima with a central pressure of 985 hPa by 9 AM on August 13. The typhoon slowed down near the Okinawa seas, remaining stationary in the East China Sea from 9 AM on August 13 to 3 PM on August 15. By 9 PM on August 14, it changed course northeastward toward Kyushu, approaching Tsushima with a central pressure of 970 hPa by 3 PM on August 16. It exited into the Sea of Japan by 6 PM the same day and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 9 PM on August 17 at 45°4'N, 135°8'E in the Primorsky Krai region of the Soviet Union (now Russia). The typhoon's path, which included stalling in the East China Sea and making a sharp U-turn, was highly unusual and complex.  \n\nDue to the typhoon, ship damage occurred off the northern coast of Kyushu. From the night of August 17 to August 18, the autumn rain front (cold front) extending from the remnants of the typhoon caused extremely heavy rainfall, particularly in the Chubu region. In Minami Village, Gujo District, Gifu Prefecture (now Minami, Gujo City), over 100 mm of rainfall was recorded in one hour. In Shirakawa Town, Gifu Prefecture, which was hit by this torrential rain, two tourist buses were caught in a landslide and fell into the swollen Hida River, resulting in 104 fatalities."

However, the typhoon's path was blocked by a high-pressure system, and the westerly jet stream did not shift southward. As a result, the typhoon moved very slowly northward over the eastern seas of Okinawa and the Amami Islands until September 29. These regions experienced stormy weather for nearly two days. On September 30, as the typhoon crossed 30 degrees north latitude, it rapidly accelerated northeastward, making landfall near Muroto City, Kochi Prefecture, around 6:30 PM. The central pressure at landfall was 955 hPa, and it remained a strong typhoon. Around 11 PM, it made a second landfall in Osaka, traversed the Chubu and Tohoku regions, and exited into the sea off Hachinohe by 9 AM on October 1. By 3 PM on the same day, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Due to its strong intensity, the typhoon recorded a maximum wind speed of 47.7 m/s and a maximum instantaneous wind speed of 66.9 m/s at Cape Muroto, as well as winds exceeding 40 m/s in areas such as Tokushima, Nara, and Hikone. \n\nIn Shiga Prefecture, on the Kosei Line, a freight train derailed due to a gust of wind, causing two freight cars to fall off an elevated track. A notable characteristic of this typhoon was its very slow movement while passing east of the Southwest Islands, contrasted with its rapid acceleration as it approached the mainland. By the time it made landfall near Muroto City, it was traveling at 45 km/h, and by the time it traversed the Tohoku region, it had reached speeds of 90 km/h. Notably, three weeks later, Typhoon No. 20 followed a similar path, causing significant damage in Japan."

Tropical depressions monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) will have the suffix \"W\" added to their sequence number. Tropical depressions that form or move into the area monitored by the Philippines will also be named by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). This is why a storm may sometimes have two different names. This is also the second consecutive typhoon season where the first storm formed from the final days of the previous year. The 2019 typhoon season had a unique feature as it began in the final days of 2018 with a tropical depression forming from a low-pressure area on December 31, 2018, and strengthening into a storm on January 1, 2019, named Pabuk (designation 1901). The 2019 typhoon season was unusual as Typhoon Wutip intensified to Category 5 in February, the strongest typhoon recorded during this period since February 1911. Three storms—Lekima (making landfall in Fujian Province, China, in early August), Faxai, and Hagibis (making landfall in the Kanto region, Japan, in early September and mid-October)—caused the most significant damage to lives and property that year."

In February 2019, a strong typhoon named Wutip appeared, marking the strongest typhoon ever recorded in February. However, from March to June, no typhoons formed, only a few weak tropical depressions. It wasn't until late June 2019 that Typhoon Sepat appeared.  \n\nIn July, cyclonic activity increased, but weather conditions inside and outside the typhoons (sea surface temperature, thermal energy, wind shear, etc.) hindered their development, resulting in mostly weak typhoons such as Mun, Danas, Nari, and Wipha. By August 2019, typhoon activity intensified with the emergence of typhoons Francisco, Lekima, Krosa, Bailu, and Podul. Among them, Typhoon Lekima made landfall in eastern China, causing $9 billion in damages.  \n\nIn September and October, Typhoon Lingling made landfall in North Korea, while Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis struck Japan, causing over $23 billion in damages. The typhoon season became more active from the latter half of October until the end of the year, with the appearance of 10 typhoons, most of which were strong. Notably, Typhoons Matmo and Nakri made landfall in South Central Vietnam, Typhoon Kammuri struck the Philippines during the 30th SEA Games, and Typhoon Phanfone hit the Philippines on Christmas.  \n\nThe combined damages from just three typhoons—Lekima, Faxai, and Hagibis—amounted to over $32 billion, accounting for 92% of the total damages for the entire typhoon season, making the 2019 typhoon season the most devastating in the history of Northwest Pacific typhoon seasons."

By mid-July, a tropical depression appeared but exited the South China Sea; at the end of July and early August, Typhoon No. 3 (Wipha) appeared and made landfall in Quang Ninh, causing heavy rain in the Northern region and Thanh Hoa. At the end of August 2019, Typhoon No. 4 (Podul) made landfall in Quang Binh, and shortly after, in early September, the first tropical depression of September (Typhoon Kajiki) made landfall in Quang Tri - Thua Thien Hue, causing heavy rain and severe flooding. On September 2, 2019, there were also two tropical depressions active in the South China Sea at relatively close distances. From September 5 to October 27, 2019 (in the following month and a half), due to the influence of various factors such as a weak intertropical convergence zone and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, the typhoon season in the South China Sea became quiet. It wasn't until October 28 that Typhoon No. 5 (Matmo) formed and made landfall in Phu Yen two days later; this province was also the landfall area for Typhoon No. 6 (Nakri) 10 days later. Both typhoons caused significant damage to the southern central coastal region. In December 2019, two typhoons, Kammuri (No. 7) and Phanfone (No. 8), entered the South China Sea with strong intensities of category 12-13 but both weakened and dissipated in the middle of the South China Sea. Typhoon Phanfone weakened and dissipated on December 28, marking the end of the 2019 typhoon season in the South China Sea. The 2019 typhoon season was similar to those of 1981 and 1994."

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a warning that low-pressure area 20W could intensify into a storm within the next 24 hours. The following day, JMA began monitoring and forecasting the tropical depression. By October 6, JMA named the storm Hagibis. Hagibis underwent an extremely rapid intensification process, transforming from a tropical storm on October 6 to a Category 5 super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale with wind speeds increasing by 140 km/h within just 12 hours. This was considered the most explosive intensification of a tropical cyclone on Earth since Super Typhoon Yates in 1996. On the afternoon of October 7, Hagibis surpassed Typhoon Wutip from February to become the second strongest storm in the Northwest Pacific this year, only behind Typhoon Halong. The storm then shifted northwest, passing through the Mariana Islands at 15:30 UTC on October 7 while reaching its peak intensity with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h, a minimum pressure of 915 hPa (27.02 inHg), and 1-minute sustained winds of 295 km/h (185 mph). By the morning of October 8, Hagibis weakened slightly to a Category 4 super typhoon and successfully underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, with its eye reorganized and regaining Category 5 super typhoon status with 1-minute sustained winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) by the morning of October 9. Hagibis gradually moved northward and weakened due to diminishing favorable conditions for storm activity. Around 09:00 UTC (6 PM local time) on October 12, Hagibis made direct landfall on the Izu Peninsula, Chiba Prefecture, Honshu, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h and a minimum pressure of 950 hPa. The storm was described as \"the strongest and worst in over a decade\" in eastern Japan, prompting the government to issue emergency warnings for strong winds, flash floods, dangerous landslides, and widespread flooding in the Kantō region, including Shizuoka, Nagano, Kanagawa, Saitama, Gunma, Tokyo, and Yamanashi. All railway and aviation systems in Japan were temporarily suspended. As of the morning of October 13, Hagibis had caused at least 35 fatalities and 17 missing persons."

The storm maintained its intensity while moving slowly towards the Philippine Islands. By the morning of December 2, as it approached the Philippine mainland, Kammuri entered a phase of rapid intensification. Around 8:00 PM PLT (local time) on December 2, Kammuri made landfall directly in the Bicol region and northern Samar with its peak intensity and maximum winds reaching up to 215 km/h. Kammuri continued moving westward, entering the South China Sea on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 3, with its winds decreasing to level 12, becoming the 7th storm of the year. The storm weakened rapidly due to strong northeastern wind shear and low sea surface temperatures of approximately 25-26 degrees. JTWC issued its final forecast on the morning of December 7."

On the evening of December 24, the storm made landfall in the Tacloban Strait between Leyte and Samar. Due to favorable conditions, Phanfone reached Category 2 typhoon status immediately after making landfall. The storm made landfall five times as it passed through central Philippines, causing at least 28 fatalities. By the morning of December 26, the storm officially entered the South China Sea, becoming the 8th storm of the year and also the strongest storm in the South China Sea that year.

Although no official timeframe is set for the typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to the waters of the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2017 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) with international names and are assigned international numbers starting with 17xx. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter \"W.\" Tropical depressions that enter or form within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) are given local names by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (with the international name being the official one). Additionally, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau may differ from those used in Taiwan. The information for each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak intensity during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

The total number of typhoons forming in the western North Pacific was estimated to be about 21 to 25, close to the climate average of 23.1. Lu Guochen, director of the Weather Forecast Center, stated that the climate this year is normal, with a low likelihood of El Niño or La Niña events. Therefore, the formation and impact of typhoons this year are also expected to be normal. Regarding the intensity of typhoons hitting Taiwan, he mentioned that there is a 70% to 80% chance of them being of medium intensity or higher, and the possibility of autumn typhoons cannot be ruled out, reminding the public to prepare for typhoon prevention."

Although this low-pressure area formed over the open ocean, its center was initially very disorganized. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the disturbance number 93W at 9 a.m. on the 20th of the same month, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rated its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low\" at 8 a.m. on the 21st. With the assistance of high atmospheric pressure, low wind shear, and relatively high sea temperatures, the low-pressure area began to consolidate, and its structure became more organized. Major weather agencies predicted its movement path to be west-northwest, with some agencies optimistic about its development and intensity, while others were less so.  \n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression at 8 p.m. on the 23rd, followed by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center raising its rating to \"medium\" at 4 a.m. on the 24th and then to \"high\" at 1 p.m. the same day. Benefiting from favorable environmental conditions nearby, the low-pressure area continued to develop. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the number 03W at 2 a.m. on April 25, while the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning for Tropical Depression 03W at 8 a.m. the same day. As Tropical Depression 03W rapidly developed and intensified, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical storm at 2 a.m. on April 26, and the Japan Meteorological Agency followed suit at 8 a.m., upgrading it to a tropical storm, assigning it the international number 1701, and naming the tropical cyclone \"Muifa,\" making it the first named tropical cyclone of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season.  \n\nAlthough the tropical storm was named, major weather agencies were not optimistic about its subsequent intensity development and predicted it would change direction, shifting from west-northwest to north and then to east-northeast, due to the influence of the eastward-moving westerly trough. As expected, \"Muifa\" moved along the weak point of the subtropical ridge southeast of Japan, gradually moving toward the westerly trough and slowly weakening. As \"Muifa\" weakened, the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded it to a tropical depression at 8:50 p.m. on April 27, with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issuing its final warning at 5 a.m. the next day. The Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 8 p.m. on the 29th.

However, it eventually developed independently and intensified into a severe tropical storm. It made landfall in Vietnam's Nghe An Province at 2:10 AM on July 17. After landfall, its intensity rapidly weakened due to the frictional effects of the terrain, and it dissipated on July 18.

As Mawar intensified, a baroclinic system west of the International Date Line gradually transformed into a low-pressure area on the morning of the 19th, and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the tropical disturbance number 97W at 9 a.m. The low-level circulation center of this low-pressure area was partially exposed to the west due to dry air intrusion and vertical wind shear, but its eastern outflow channel continued to improve, and the warm sea surface provided sufficient energy. At 2 a.m. on the 20th, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low\" at 5 a.m.\n\nIn the afternoon, its deep convection gradually filled the previously exposed eastern side of the low-level circulation center, forming a broader low-level circulation center. Its extratropical cyclone characteristics also gradually weakened. Additionally, as the system was located beneath a strong upper-level low-pressure area, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its rating to \"medium\" at 2 p.m. and classified the system as a subtropical depression. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning at 3:30 p.m., indicating the possibility of intensifying into a tropical storm within a day. On the morning of the 21st, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the system to a subtropical storm at 8 a.m., then raised its rating to \"high\" at 1:30 p.m. and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. At 3:15 p.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency officially upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm, naming it Rose and assigning it the international number 1706. The China Meteorological Administration followed suit at 3:48 p.m. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center subsequently announced at 5 p.m. that the system had transitioned into a tropical storm, assigning it the tropical cyclone number 09W.\n\nInitially influenced by a deep subtropical ridge, Rose moved northward. On the morning of the 22nd, it shifted westward, approaching Tropical Cyclone Mawar, and developed a \"pinhole eye\" in the afternoon. In the evening, Rose moved into cooler waters, and its subtropical characteristics re-emerged. Temperature scanning systems indicated that Rose developed partial cold-core structures, suggesting it was a \"hybrid system.\" Its low-level circulation center was once again exposed, with upper-level convection nearly dissipated, though low-level clouds continued to spiral into the center. By the 24th, it formed a central dense overcast area. On the 25th, Rose began interacting with Mawar, and Mawar's outflow caused strong vertical wind shear on Rose, leading to significant weakening. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded Rose to a tropical depression at 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., respectively, with the latter issuing its final warning at 11 a.m. on the 26th. Rose rotated counterclockwise around Mawar and was fully absorbed into Mawar's circulation by midnight on the 28th."

Initially, major agencies believed Sangka would develop further, with a chance of making landfall near the Pearl River Estuary. However, predictions later changed, forecasting it to move toward Hainan Island as a tropical depression. It initially had strong convection, but its intensity began to weaken after entering the southern South China Sea due to high wind shear and low sea temperatures. However, as it moved to the central South China Sea, it strengthened again, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression at 11 a.m. on July 21.

This tropical cyclone struck Hong Kong directly on the morning of July 23, 2017, at tropical storm intensity, making landfall on the Sai Kung Peninsula. The Hong Kong Observatory issued the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal at the time, but since none of the 8 reference automatic weather stations in Hong Kong recorded even strong winds during the storm's passage—falling far short of the standard for the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal—some citizens criticized the Observatory for being too lenient in issuing the signal."

The name \"Guchol\" ([xʊʃɔl̩]) was provided by the Federated States of Micronesia and means turmeric in the Yapese language. This storm developed in the eastern waters of the Philippines, briefly strengthening to a tropical storm while crossing the Luzon Strait, but dissipated in the Taiwan Strait due to increased vertical wind shear."

                "content": "Guchao developed in the eastern sea area of the Philippines, becoming the fourth tropical cyclone to form in this nearby sea area since late August. On September 1, numerical forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts predicted that this system would pass through northern Luzon Island but was expected to have no room for development. However, on the 3rd, vertical wind shear in the sea area where the system was located weakened, and the sea surface temperature remained high, giving the system a chance to develop. The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 4 a.m. the next day. Shortly after, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan marked the system as a tropical depression on its weather map. By 9 a.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency predicted that the tropical depression would strengthen into a tropical storm within 24 hours and issued a gale warning. About an hour later, the China National Meteorological Center also upgraded the system to a tropical depression. The Central Weather Bureau predicted in the afternoon that it might strengthen into a mild typhoon that evening or the next day. However, due to deteriorating environmental conditions, it was expected to remain a tropical depression by the 7th. At 5 a.m. the next morning, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also upgraded the system to a tropical depression. Due to slightly increased vertical wind shear in the sea area it passed through, the system's upper and lower layers became separated, and the low-level center was fully exposed, slowing its development and even showing signs of weakening. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final report at 11 a.m. At this time, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau predicted that it would pass through the Luzon Strait and enter the South China Sea. Numerical forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts predicted landfall in southern Taiwan, while the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration predicted it would brush past the eastern sea area of Taiwan. The Central Weather Bureau postponed the estimated time for it to strengthen into a mild typhoon to the next day. As vertical wind shear in the sea area it passed through slightly weakened, cloud clusters near the center began to organize, and its intensity started to increase significantly. At 5 a.m. the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center resumed issuing reports on the system. At 9:25 a.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency was the first to upgrade the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the number 1717 and naming it Guchao. Later, the China National Meteorological Center followed suit. At 8 a.m., the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded Guchao to a mild typhoon (although internally, the bureau did not agree that it had already developed into a typhoon, but it upgraded it to align with Japan). The Hong Kong Observatory did not upgrade Guchao to a tropical depression until 10 a.m. Due to increased vertical wind shear in the sea area where Guchao was located, the separation between its upper and lower layers became more severe, causing its intensity to weaken. At 11:29 p.m., the China National Meteorological Center downgraded Guchao back to a tropical depression. At 2:30 a.m. the next day, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan also downgraded it to a tropical depression. The Japan Meteorological Agency also downgraded Guchao to a tropical depression, and at 5 a.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final report. Although it had been downgraded, Guchao's center remained clearly visible but later gradually dissipated. At 5 p.m. that afternoon, the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded Guchao to a low-pressure area. Later, as the circulation center became difficult to distinguish, the China National Meteorological Center stopped assigning a number to Guchao at 8 p.m. The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency indicated on its weather map that Guchao had been absorbed into a frontal system."

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued a Signal No. 1 storm warning at 11 PM, when Guchao was located approximately 365 kilometers east of Aurora Province. Subsequently, Guchao gradually moved away, about to enter the Bashi Channel and exit the agency's area of responsibility. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration lifted the storm warning at 11 AM on the 6th, when Guchao was located approximately 115 kilometers west of Basco."

The Central Weather Bureau stated that if Koinu strengthens into a mild typhoon, a sea typhoon warning will be issued, and the possibility of issuing a land typhoon warning is not ruled out. As Koinu strengthened into a mild typhoon, the Central Weather Bureau issued a sea typhoon warning at 10:30 AM, with Koinu located 190 kilometers south-southwest of Eluanbi at the time. On the 7th, Koinu weakened into a tropical depression, and the Central Weather Bureau issued a special report on a tropical depression at 2:30 AM, with Koinu located about 160 kilometers south-southwest of Penghu at the time.

The typhoon moved northwest and grew to a central pressure of 945 mb (equivalent to hPa) and wind speeds of 50 m/s around 500 km south of Cape Muroto on the 11th. After changing its course to west-northwest and slightly weakening, it made landfall near the Osumi Peninsula in Kagoshima Prefecture from Shibushi Bay at noon on the 13th. When it passed near Miyakonojo City in Miyazaki Prefecture, it had a central pressure of 960 mb and wind speeds exceeding 30 m/s. It then traversed the Kyushu region and exited into the Sea of Japan around 3 a.m. on the 14th. After moving eastward over the Sea of Japan, it made landfall again near the Matsumae Peninsula in Hokkaido, crossed Hokkaido, and dissipated into the Sea of Okhotsk on the 15th. The typhoon caused significant damage in various areas due to factors such as the short interval of only 10 days since the arrival of Typhoon Jane, continued heavy rain from low pressure after the typhoon passed, and storm surges affecting areas where the ground had subsided due to the 1946 Showa Nankai Earthquake."

The Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan issued a tropical depression advisory at 5:15 a.m. At 7 a.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low.\" By 12:30 p.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours directly to \"high,\" skipping \"medium,\" and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Later that afternoon, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the number 08W. \n\nOn June 15 at 10 a.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm, assigned it the international number 1806, and named it Kaimi. However, most meteorological agencies did not follow suit in upgrading it, instead maintaining it at the upper limit of tropical depression intensity. This included Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau, which continued to classify it as a tropical depression. Kaimi made landfall in Kaohsiung between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. and exited to sea from Taitung around 12 p.m., but the Central Weather Bureau maintained the tropical depression advisory instead of upgrading it to a tropical storm and issuing sea and land typhoon warnings. \n\nIt was not until June 16 that various meteorological agencies upgraded Kaimi to a tropical storm. The Central Weather Bureau also upgraded Kaimi to a tropical storm on the morning of June 16. On the morning of June 17, the Japan Meteorological Agency determined that Kaimi had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone."

Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to the waters of the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are referred to as hurricanes and are included in the 2018 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) with international numbers starting with 18xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in the region a number ending with the letter W. Any tropical depression that enters or forms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility is given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). Additionally, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan may differ. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak form during its existence.

                "content": "On December 31, 2017, a tropical depression formed east of the Philippines and made landfall in the southern Philippines the following evening. After entering the South China Sea, the tropical depression intensified into the first named tropical cyclone of the year: Bolaven. Bolaven weakened and dissipated in the South China Sea due to increased vertical wind shear. A month later, Sanba formed and affected the same area in the Philippines, dissipating due to terrain effects. Another month later, Jelawat formed near Guam, initially affected by vertical wind shear. As the wind shear weakened, Jelawat intensified into the season's first typhoon on the morning of March 30 and unexpectedly strengthened into the year's first super typhoon that afternoon. Jelawat later weakened due to vertical wind shear and unusually transitioned into a subtropical cyclone. From Jelawat's dissipation until Ewiniar's formation, no tropical cyclones were named by the Japan Meteorological Agency in the Northwest Pacific. \n\nAt the end of May, numerical forecast models began predicting low-pressure areas or tropical cyclone activity in the South China Sea and east of the Philippines in early June. Two low-pressure areas formed simultaneously on May 31, and another low-pressure area formed near Guam on June 1. The low-pressure area in the South China Sea intensified into a tropical depression and moved northward, strengthening into a tropical storm named Ewiniar by the Japan Meteorological Agency when it made landfall in Xuwen, Guangdong, on June 6. It then crossed the Qiongzhou Strait southward, made landfall in Haikou, Hainan, and moved eastward. On June 7, it took a northeastward path and made landfall in Yangjiang, Guangdong, that evening, gradually weakening and dissipating. Meanwhile, the tropical depression east of the Philippines absorbed another system and intensified into a tropical storm named Maliksi by the Japan Meteorological Agency. \n\nIn mid-June, Gaemi made landfall in Taiwan, but most meteorological agencies did not upgrade it to a tropical storm until after landfall. In late June, Prapiroon formed, moving northward and affecting Japan and South Korea. On the afternoon of July 4, Prapiroon transitioned into an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Japan. That evening, Maria formed and rapidly intensified, reaching typhoon status within a day according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency. On July 6, Maria reached super typhoon status according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Maria then moved quickly northwestward, impacting northern Taiwan, Ishigaki Island, and areas in Fujian and Zhejiang. \n\nIn mid-to-late July, the monsoon trough and easterly waves became active, leading to the formation of multiple tropical systems. Son-Tinh accelerated significantly, crossing the northern South China Sea at 40 km/h and making landfall in Vietnam on July 19. Son-Tinh's remnants re-entered the sea and re-intensified into a tropical depression, lingering in the Gulf of Tonkin before dissipating. Ampil became the third storm on record to make landfall in Shanghai from the East China Sea. Wukong reached typhoon intensity at high latitudes. Jongdari's movement path was highly unusual, becoming the fourth tropical cyclone since 1951 to move east to west into Japan's Honshu and the first to sweep across Honshu and Kyushu inland. This system also became the fourth storm to make landfall in Shanghai from the East China Sea and the second typhoon to do so in the year. After Jongdari dissipated, the first active period of the monsoon trough and easterly waves in the Northwest Pacific ended. \n\nIn early August, Shanshan passed close to Japan before moving northward and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Yagi made landfall in Zhejiang, China, on August 12 and weakened into a tropical depression the next day. In mid-August, the monsoon trough and easterly waves became active again. Leepi initially intensified rapidly but later weakened due to the influence of tropical disturbance 98W (later Tropical Storm Bebinca). Bebinca lingered over the sea for a time before making landfall in Vietnam on August 17. On August 13, Hurricane Hector from the Eastern Pacific crossed the International Date Line into the Northwest Pacific. Hector weakened into a tropical depression on August 15. Rumbia became the fifth tropical cyclone since 1949 to move westward over the sea and make direct landfall in Shanghai, and it was the first time since 1873 that three tropical cyclones made direct landfall in Shanghai within a single month. Soulik broke the record for the highest gusts measured in nine years on Nakano-shima, with wind speeds reaching 50.1 m/s (180 km/h). Cimaron formed on August 18, reaching its peak intensity on the morning of August 22 with a clear eye. That afternoon, Cimaron moved into cooler waters, and its intensity began to weaken. On August 23, Cimaron and Soulik made landfall in Japan and South Korea, respectively, transitioning into extratropical cyclones on August 24 and 25. From Son-Tinh's formation on July 17 to Soulik's transition into an extratropical cyclone on August 25, the Northwest Pacific experienced nearly 40 consecutive days of named typhoon activity, setting a new record for prolonged typhoon activity in the region. \n\nOn August 28, Jebi formed. Jebi's naming marked the season as having the most named tropical cyclones formed from January to August on record, with 21, just two fewer than the 1965 and 1971 Pacific typhoon seasons. Many of the tropical cyclones formed in August developed at higher latitudes and moved northward due to a stronger subtropical high, allowing Jebi to move westward and rapidly intensify by absorbing energy stored in the region. At 5 a.m. on August 31, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded Jebi to a super typhoon, with wind speeds reaching Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, making it the second tropical cyclone of the year to reach this level after Maria. On the morning of September 4, Jebi made landfall in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan, and two hours later in Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture. On the morning of September 5, the Japan Meteorological Agency declared Jebi had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. \n\nOn September 7, Mangkhut formed, becoming the third typhoon of the year to reach Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Mangkhut had a broad circulation and strong winds, causing severe damage in multiple regions. On September 11, Barijat formed, making landfall in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, on the morning of September 13. At 3:45 p.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression. On September 21, Trami formed. Trami's location had sea surface temperatures of 28°C, weak vertical wind shear, and good upper-level outflow, allowing it to rapidly intensify and develop a central dense overcast with radiating outer bands. At 5 a.m. on September 25, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its wind speed to 140 knots (260 km/h), making it the fourth typhoon of the year to reach Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale after Maria, Jebi, and Mangkhut. The Pacific high ridge slightly strengthened on September 28, causing Trami to accelerate northwestward. At 7 p.m. on September 30, Trami made landfall in Tanabe, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. On October 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency declared Trami had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. \n\nOn September 29, Kong-rey formed. Kong-rey's naming marked the season as having the most named tropical cyclones formed from January to September since 1994, with 25. Kong-rey's location had sea surface temperatures of 29–30°C and weak wind shear, allowing it to rapidly intensify. On October 2, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its wind speed to 140 knots (260 km/h), making it the fifth typhoon of the year to reach Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale after Maria, Jebi, Mangkhut, and Trami. That evening, Kong-rey moved into cooler waters, and its intensity began to decrease significantly. At 8 a.m. on October 6, Kong-rey made landfall in Tongyeong, Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea. On October 7, the Japan Meteorological Agency declared Kong-rey had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. \n\nOn October 22, Yutu formed. At 11 a.m. on October 24, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a super typhoon, with wind speeds reaching 145 knots (269 km/h), making it the sixth typhoon of the year to reach Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Later, its wind speed was further upgraded to 155 knots (287 km/h). The Japan Meteorological Agency also raised its maximum sustained wind speed to 215 km/h at 5:45 p.m. that day, surpassing Mangkhut to become the strongest storm of 2018 and the seventh typhoon to be rated as \"violent\" by the Japan Meteorological Agency. On the evening of October 25, Yutu developed a double eyewall west of Guam and entered an eyewall replacement cycle, leading the Central Weather Bureau to downgrade it to a moderate typhoon. On October 26, Yutu completed its eyewall replacement cycle, and the Central Weather Bureau re-upgraded it to a strong typhoon. In the early hours of October 30, Yutu made landfall in Dinapigue, Isabela Province, Philippines. At 2:45 p.m. on November 2, the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression. \n\nIn early November, Usagi formed, reaching its peak intensity before weakening and making landfall in Vietnam. On November 17, Toraji formed. On November 18, the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression, but its remnants persisted until completely dissipating on November 21. On November 20, Man-yi formed. Despite having a well-organized structure, it was in an unfavorable environment and began weakening shortly after reaching its peak due to dry air and low sea temperatures."

At that time, numerical weather prediction models indicated that the system would take a westward path, though there were differences in intensity forecasts. On February 11, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Sanba, assigning it the international number 1802. Due to the influence of vertical wind shear, Sanba's intensification stalled repeatedly on February 12, only slightly strengthening later that evening as convective cloud bands filled the previously exposed low-level circulation center.  \n\nThe subtropical ridge remained strong, steering Sanba westward at a speed of 25 km/h toward the Philippines. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced that Sanba made landfall in Hinatuan, Mindanao, at 9:15 AM. Later in the morning, Sanba quickly passed over the northeastern tip of Mindanao and entered the Bohol Sea. PAGASA announced its second landfall in Clarin, Bohol, at 2:00 PM.

Computer numerical forecast models indicated that the system's path and intensity were difficult to predict due to the binary typhoon effect caused by another low-pressure area to the southwest (which later developed into Tropical Cyclone Ampil), adding uncertainty to the system's development. In fact, after its formation, the system interacted with that low-pressure area, competing for moisture and causing slow development. Initially, the system moved northwest at a speed of about 10 km/h. By the 14th, it shifted to a west-northwest direction. At the same time, computer model discrepancies gradually narrowed, predicting that the system would not absorb the low-pressure area to its south but would move into the South China Sea via northern Luzon or the Bashi Channel, though its subsequent path remained uncertain. On the 15th, the system's speed increased to 20 km/h, shifted to a west-southwest direction, and intensified into a tropical depression with increasing spiral structure. \n\nUnder the significant strengthening of the subtropical ridge extending westward from the north of the system, the system further accelerated to 30 km/h on July 16, moving directly west and breaking free from the influence of the low-pressure area to its southeast. Although vertical wind shear slightly affected its development, the system continued to consolidate its low-level circulation center due to sea surface temperatures of 30°C. Numerical forecast discrepancies further narrowed, predicting the system would move rapidly westward across the northern South China Sea via the Balintang Channel and make landfall between Hainan and the Leizhou Peninsula. The tropical depression passed over the Babuyan Islands in the evening. After entering the South China Sea early on the 17th, it accelerated to 40 km/h, crossing the northern South China Sea, and strengthened into a tropical storm in the morning, named Son-Tinh by the Japan Meteorological Agency with the international designation 1809. During the day, Son-Tinh moved steadily westward, slightly shifting to a west-southwest direction at night, heading directly for Hainan, and eventually made landfall in Wanning, Hainan, early on the 18th. Due to its rapid movement, the impact of terrain was significantly reduced, and Son-Tinh moved into the Beibu Gulf before noon, subsequently slowing down and reorganizing. By early on the 19th, it made landfall again in northern Vietnam, weakened into a tropical depression in the morning, and further weakened into a low-pressure area the next day (20th).\n\nHowever, benefiting from the continuous moisture supply from the southwest monsoon, the remnants of Son-Tinh's low-pressure area did not dissipate but maintained its spiral structure, unaffected by terrain erosion, lingering over northern Vietnam and Laos, causing flooding in the region. By the 21st, under the strengthening of the equatorial anticyclone to the south, Son-Tinh \"turned around\" and moved eastward back into the Beibu Gulf, re-intensifying into a tropical depression in the afternoon. Son-Tinh crossed Hainan again from the 22nd to the 23rd and made landfall on the Leizhou Peninsula, then slowly moved northward.

                "content": "Typhoon Banyan (International designation: 1712, Joint Typhoon Warning Center: WP142017) was the 12th named tropical cyclone in the Northwest Pacific. The name \"Banyan\" (International Phonetic Alphabet: [ˈbæn.jən]) was provided by Hong Kong and refers to a common type of tree in the South China region. Banyan was an oceanic storm that did not affect any land throughout its course. The cyclone originated from a low-pressure area southeast of Wake Island, and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory designated it as tropical disturbance 90W at 3 PM on the 10th. The system rapidly developed, and the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression and issued a gale warning at 9:05 AM the following day. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center followed suit three hours later and upgraded it further to a tropical storm six hours after that. The Japan Meteorological Agency also upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Banyan at 8:50 PM. At the time, various agencies predicted Banyan would strengthen to a tropical storm or severe tropical storm intensity, but its slow movement allowed it to develop faster than expected. Banyan developed a central dense overcast on the afternoon of the 12th and intensified into a severe tropical storm. Benefiting from warm sea temperatures, high specific heat capacity, weak vertical wind shear, and a favorable environment with enhanced outflow on the eastern side due to an upper-level tropical trough, it developed a \"pinhole eye\" and intensified into a typhoon. The China National Meteorological Center further upgraded Banyan to a strong typhoon at 5:31 PM. \n\nDue to increased vertical wind shear, Banyan's intensity dropped to Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale but re-intensified to Category 2 by the early hours of the 14th. That evening, Banyan moved to the western side of the subtropical ridge, shifted to a northeastward path, and encountered cooler sea temperatures, leading to weakening. Its eye became obscured, and the China National Meteorological Center downgraded Banyan to a typhoon at 8:30 PM. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded it to a tropical storm at 5 PM on the 16th but re-upgraded it to a typhoon six hours later at 11 PM. On August 17, the Japan Meteorological Agency announced that Typhoon Banyan had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Later, the China National Meteorological Center also confirmed that Banyan had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone."

                "content": "The first typhoon active period of 2017 ended with Typhoon Noru weakening and dissipating after ravaging Japan, but soon another tropical cyclone formed. A low-pressure area developed on August 10 west of the International Date Line, southeast of Wake Island, and was designated as tropical disturbance 90W by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory at 3 PM. The system initially developed rapidly, with convective bands wrapping into the center. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed its chance of forming into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low\" at 10 PM but upgraded it directly to \"high\" six hours later at 4 AM on August 11, issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 9:05 AM and issued a gale warning. Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau (CWB) also upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 8 AM. As the system continued to strengthen, with deep convection further wrapping into the center, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression at 11 AM, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 14W. By 5 PM, even before being named, the system was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC. The CWB upgraded it to a light typhoon at 8 PM, and the JMA officially upgraded it to a tropical storm at 8:50 PM, naming it Banyan and assigning it the international designation 1712. China's National Meteorological Center (NMC) followed suit at 9:16 PM.\n\nOn that day, the subtropical ridge extended southeastward, causing Banyan to maintain a west-northwest trajectory at a speed of about 15 km/h. Official agencies predicted Banyan would become a \"recurving\" tropical cyclone, turning northward under the influence of a mid-latitude westerly trough weakening the subtropical ridge. However, its intensity was not expected to exceed tropical storm to severe tropical storm levels. Nevertheless, the warm sea surface temperatures, weak vertical wind shear, and favorable outflow environment on the eastern side of the system allowed Banyan to intensify rapidly, prompting agencies to revise their intensity forecasts upward. As the westerly trough weakened the subtropical ridge, Banyan gradually turned northwestward. Despite a slight increase in vertical wind shear, the system's central convection remained consolidated, forming a central dense overcast. The JMA and NMC upgraded Banyan to a severe tropical storm at 2 PM and 2:57 PM on August 12, respectively.\n\nAs vertical wind shear decreased, Banyan developed a \"pinhole eye\" on August 13, prompting the JMA, NMC, and JTWC to upgrade it to a typhoon at 2 AM, 2:34 AM, and 5 AM, respectively. The NMC further upgraded Banyan to a strong typhoon at 5:31 PM. Banyan reached its first intensity peak at noon, but increasing vertical wind shear later exposed its low-level circulation center to the north. The JTWC anticipated Banyan to reach a peak intensity of 130 knots, the threshold for a super typhoon, just shy of Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The NMC predicted Banyan would weaken to a typhoon during its recurvature and reintensify into a strong typhoon afterward. However, the JMA did not forecast Banyan to reach the \"very strong typhoon\" category. Subsequently, Banyan's equatorial outflow channel was blocked, and its eye disappeared, leading the JTWC and NMC to retract their intensity forecasts.\n\nOn August 14, vertical wind shear decreased, and Banyan reorganized over 30°C waters, with signs of reestablishing its polar outflow and eye. Banyan reached its second peak intensity on August 15, but its circulation remained very small. The JMA assessed Banyan's gale-force wind radius to be only 60 km, with a 30-knot wind radius of 280 km to the east and 170 km to the west. The NMC and CWB estimated Banyan's western circulation's 7-level wind radius at 150 km, with the NMC assessing its eastern circulation at 180 km and its 10-level wind radius at 80 km to the east and 50 km to the west. The CWB estimated its 10-level wind radius at only 50 km. These estimates indicated Banyan's circulation was even smaller than the earlier weak tropical storm Nesat.\n\nBanyan began weakening at dusk, with its \"pinhole eye\" filling in and becoming a \"cloud-filled eye.\" Cloud-top temperatures warmed, and convection near the center weakened. The NMC downgraded Banyan to a typhoon at 8:30 PM, and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm at 5 PM on August 16. Agencies predicted Banyan would accelerate northeastward and possibly cross the International Date Line into the Central Pacific. Banyan reorganized and redeveloped a \"pinhole eye\" that evening, prompting the JTWC to re-upgrade it to a typhoon at 11 PM. On August 17, the JMA declared Banyan had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The NMC later also declared Banyan had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.\n\nIn the \"2017 Tropical Cyclone Best Track Data\" released by the NMC on May 1, 2018, Banyan's intensity was revised downward to a typhoon, with its maximum sustained winds near the center reduced from 45 m/s (160 km/h) to 42 m/s (145 km/h), and its central pressure adjusted upward to 955 hPa."
