                "content": "The eyewitness Emo of Wittewierum, the later abbot of the Premonstratensian monastery of Wittewierum near Groningen, noted in the Chronicon abbatum in Werum that on January 16, 1219, \"in the 55th year after the Julian flood,\" the \"bloodthirsty southwest wind,\" which had been bringing hail for days, turned into a storm, shifted to the northwest during the night at full moon, and caused great floods that overflowed the dikes and washed away the houses. Although Abbot Emo attempted a natural philosophical explanation, he ultimately interpreted the Marcellus flood and the subsequent famine as a deluge \"because of our crimes.\" The wealthy marsh farmers had not thought of the poor; therefore, they lost their land. According to an unreliable report in the Saxon World Chronicle, this severe storm surge, incorrectly dated to November 17, 1218, claimed about 36,000 lives along the North Sea coast. The Colmar Annals even mention a figure of 50,000 victims. West Friesland in present-day Netherlands was particularly hard hit. There, the North Sea broke through a naturally formed sand wall, creating the marine bay Zuiderzee (southern sea), which is now artificially separated from the North Sea by the IJsselmeer. Some chronicles from the 16th century attributed this storm surge to the formation of the Jade Bay. Accordingly, the water is said to have broken in at the former village mound of Alt-Gödens after it had destroyed the legendary sluice with copper doors. The parishes that were allegedly flooded at that time (Oldessen, Dauerns, Hummens, Jadele, Dangast, Arngast, and Alt-Gödens or Lee) still existed in the 1420s. Only Hiddels had already disappeared. Therefore, the expansion of the Jade Bay can only be placed in the course of the 15th century, significantly later than the storm flood legend suggests."

Rivers flooded especially in South Ostrobothnia and North Satakunta. According to meteorologist Matti Huutonen, during the day (October 5-6), some areas received as much rain as normally falls in a month. Also outside the flood area, for example in Kokemäki and Pori, over 30 millimeters of daily rainfall was recorded. In Ilmajoki, highway 67 had to be closed due to water flooding onto the road. Roads were also closed elsewhere in South Ostrobothnia. In Kankaanpää, water also rose onto the roads. In Ilmajoki, Kauhajoki, and Lapväärt, several houses were surrounded by water and basements were flooded. Residents in Kauhajoki had to be moved to temporary accommodations. MTV3 reported on October 8 that the flood situation was beginning to ease, but it added that it would take at least another week before normal water level readings could be reached. In contrast, the flood situation in Satakunta continued to be severe, as Yle reported on October 15 that more rain, about 20 millimeters, was expected there. According to Bertel Vehviläinen, the leading hydrologist at the Finnish Environment Institute, the flood of the Kyrönjoki River is the largest ever recorded in Finland. Many other rivers in South Ostrobothnia also reached record heights."

The precipitation was caused by the Vb low \"Ilse.\" A wedge of the high pressure \"Friedmann\" over Scandinavia caused the low to be pushed southward from its usual west-east path towards the Mediterranean. Here, these air masses warmed significantly due to seasonal conditions and absorbed a lot of moisture. After crossing the Alps towards the north, they encountered the cold air there, cooled down sharply, and extreme precipitation occurred in a relatively short time. The rainfall initially concentrated along the path of the low in Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, and the Czech Republic, and subsequently intensified in eastern Germany. Here, the low-pressure area rotated and completely discharged its rain by the end of its life cycle. The rainfall was additionally intensified by orographically induced lifting processes in the Alps, but especially along the middle mountain ranges (Ore and Giant Mountains). A similar weather situation was also the cause of the Oder flood in 1997."

                "content": "A first heavy rainfall event occurred on August 6/7, with focal points in Chiemgau and Berchtesgadener Land. Within 48 hours, more than 100 mm of precipitation fell widely, which corresponded to about two-thirds of the average monthly mean (1961–1990) for August. The largest daily rainfall of 117 mm was recorded on August 6 in Ruhpolding; at Wendelstein, 62 mm of rain fell in just 6 hours. This event led to soil saturation and set the stage for the actual, even higher flood event caused by rainfall from August 10 to 12. On the evening of August 10, a series of thunderstorms moved into Bavaria from the west, which later transitioned into widespread continuous rain, leading to daily precipitation of over 100 mm along the Alpine edge on August 11. On August 12, the focus shifted to the Bavarian and Upper Palatinate Forest, resulting in a 100-year rainfall event of 104 mm in 24 hours in Waldkirchen. From August 6 to 12, over 340 mm of rain was recorded in parts of southern Bavaria. On August 12, flood peaks formed on the Danube tributaries Iller, Günz, Mindel, Zusam, Schmutter, Paar, and Lech. In the district of Oberallgäu, 100-year events were observed in some areas. On August 14, a long wave formed on the Danube between the Lech mouth and Regensburg, corresponding to a 10- to 20-year flood. Also on August 12, peak levels were recorded on the rivers Isar, Loisach, Ammer, Mangfall, Tiroler Achen, Traun, Saalach, and Salzach, with return periods ranging from 50 to 100 years. The flood wave of the Inn led to a water level of 10.80 m and a discharge of 7700 m³/s in Passau on August 13 at 1 PM, corresponding to a 50-year event. This level was last exceeded in 1954 (12.20 m) and again in 2013 (12.89 m). While the flood of the Salzach in Burghausen reached a 50-year magnitude, only a 2- to 5-year event was observed on the Inn in Wasserburg. Thus, the 20- to 50-year flood of the Inn was significantly influenced by the Salzach from the mouth of the Salzach. The Sylvenstein reservoir held back up to 23.3 million cubic meters of water, preventing a larger Isar flood. Without the reservoir, a discharge of up to 730 m³/s would have occurred in Bad Tölz on August 12 instead of the actual 295 m³/s. With the shift of the rain area to the north, an extreme flood with return periods often exceeding 100 years occurred on the night of August 13 on the rivers in the catchment area of the Regen and Ilz. At the confluence of the Regen with the Danube in Regensburg, a level of 6.63 m was recorded on August 14 at 1 PM, leading to a 20-year flood up to the Isar mouth at Deggendorf and a 10-year flood further to Passau."

                "content": "The rain situation was particularly dramatic in the central and eastern Ore Mountains, where on August 12/13, 2002, in Zinnwald, a 24-hour value of 312 mm was recorded, the highest daily precipitation since the beginning of routine measurements in Germany. Due to the poor condition of the forests in these areas and the already accumulated water, the ground could not absorb such massive amounts of rainfall, causing the water to flow immediately into the valleys. The rivers originating in this area that flow into the Mulde or Elbe, such as Zschopau, Flöha, Zwickauer Mulde, Freiberger Mulde, Gimmlitz, Rote Weißeritz, Wilde Weißeritz, and Müglitz, swelled to several times their usual size within hours, leaving enormous damage in their wake. Many bridges were swept away, roads were undermined, houses were flooded and severely damaged, power and telephone supplies collapsed, entire villages were evacuated or cut off from the outside world. The Müglitztal was particularly affected. Here, the flood wave devastated Glashütte, Schlottwitz, Weesenstein, Mühlbach, Burkhardswalde, the lower town of Dohna, and Heidenau. In Glashütte, on August 12, 2002, around 5:00 PM, a small retention basin on the Prießnitz, a lower tributary of the Müglitz, broke. The flood wave, with an estimated 50,000 cubic meters of water in the Prießnitztal, raised the water level in Glashütte by another meter, but had little impact on the flooding in the Müglitz because the Prießnitz flows further downstream into the Müglitz. In many places, energy, water, and heating supplies failed. The flooding of federal, state, and county roads hindered emergency services. In the area of the Gottleuba and Seidewitz rivers, the flood reached the threshold of flooding in Pirna on August 12 at around 5:00 PM. The Gottleuba and Seidewitz overflowed their banks in Pirna by up to 1.50 meters after their confluence. In Dresden, the damage was caused not only by the first wave of the Weißeritz on August 12/13 but also by the second, higher wave of the Elbe on August 16/17. On August 12, 2002, at around 6:00 PM, a disaster alarm was triggered for Dresden. In the city center, the main train station, the Semper Opera, the Zwinger, and the state parliament were flooded. The Friedrichstadt was partially evacuated. In the following days, the disaster situation exceeded flood warning level IV in some areas. Built-up areas were completely flooded in places, and the use of water and dam defense on a larger scale became necessary. There were also fatalities. It was not until August 13, 2002, that the dimensions of the natural disaster became fully visible. More places were cut off from the outside world by the subsequent water masses. In Krippen, the water rose to the second floor. Grimma was hit by the flood of the Mulde and severely destroyed, including the historic Pöppelmann Bridge. On August 14, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder visited the city. The city of Döbeln was completely flooded by the Freiberger Mulde. In the evening, tram services in Dresden were completely suspended. On August 15, Meißen was hit by the first flood wave, partially destroying the local porcelain factory. By this time, Pirna was already reached by the second wave. Now entire villages in the Saxon Switzerland had to be evacuated. In Dresden, the districts of Laubegast, Kleinzschachwitz, and Zschieren were flooded. On August 16, traffic on the railway lines Leipzig–Dresden, Riesa–Chemnitz, and Jüterbog–Röderau, which cross the Elbe floodplain on a common dam, was suspended. A dike breach at Röderau undermined a road bridge and a flood passage of the railway embankment, causing these structures to collapse. In the evening, the flood peak reached Schöna at the border with the Czech Republic with a maximum level of 12.04 meters. On August 17, 2002, the water level in Dresden reached its peak of 9.40 meters at 7 AM. On that day, all Elbe bridges in Dresden were closed except for the A4 motorway bridge. In absolute comparison of flow rates, the Elbe flood of 2002 ranked fifth among the recorded floods in Saxony. Therefore, a recurrence interval of 100 to 200 years is assumed for such floods. The Torgau gauge reached a peak value of 9.49 meters on August 18. On August 26, the disaster alarm for Dresden was lifted. A total of 21 people lost their lives due to the flooding in Saxony."

Around 4,600 people were evacuated from low-lying districts of Dessau by the evening of August 14. In the Bitterfeld-Wolfen chemical park (most affected was the Bayer Group), an environmental disaster was prevented through massive deployment of helpers. The city of Bitterfeld itself was increasingly flooded in the following days. Near the city, a dam on the Mulde broke on August 15, flooding the former lignite open-pit mine Goitzsche. On the same day, the Pretzien weir south of Magdeburg was opened, which helped avert the greatest damage in the city area. Nevertheless, around 20,000 people were evacuated from the eastern districts of Magdeburg, and a disaster alarm was triggered for the city. Additionally, the Brandenburg city of Mühlberg was evacuated, and the cities further downstream prepared protective measures. On August 16, at 1 a.m., the crisis team decided to evacuate around 10,000 people from Bitterfeld and the surrounding area, as the city was gradually being overtaken by the floodwaters. In Saxony-Anhalt, about 2,000 soldiers of the Bundeswehr were deployed. On August 17, the water level in Mühlberg reached its peak at 9.96 m. On August 18, several dikes broke in Saxony-Anhalt at Seegrehna and Wittenberg on the Elbe, as well as at Dessau on the Mulde. In the Dessau district of Waldersee, the water quickly rose to two meters high. A sandbag logistics center was set up at Leipzig/Halle Airport to supply all threatened areas. On August 19, the situation on the A9 highway intensified, but a one-lane traffic flow was ensured. The floodwaters flowed north faster than expected. The first flood wave reached the state capital Magdeburg, which, not least due to the Elbe diversion canal, got off lightly. When the town center of Rehsen threatened to flood on August 20, the residents of the village broke through the dike of the inhabited Schönitzer Polder themselves to relieve their own dike. The fire chief of Rehsen and four other individuals were subsequently charged by the public prosecutor's office for dike destruction, but they were acquitted due to lack of evidence of specific involvement. By August 21, more than 60,000 people had been evacuated from threatened areas in Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. On August 22, around 16,300 soldiers of the Bundeswehr were deployed in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Brandenburg. On August 26, the disaster alarm for Magdeburg was lifted. Due to the slowly receding water, the disaster alarm in Dessau could only be lifted on September 13, after 32 days."

This resulted in untreated wastewater entering the Elbe. In Saxony, there were 21 fatalities due to the flood. From 2002 to 2009, 700 million euros were spent on protection projects, of which 50% came from EU funds. In evaluating the flood, a total of 300 flood areas were declared over an area of 76,000 hectares. In Saxony-Anhalt, the damage in agriculture amounted to around 420 million euros. The damage and follow-up effects on the facilities of Deutsche Bahn amounted to 1.025 billion euros, of which 750 million euros were attributed to the Free State of Saxony.

Initially affected was South Bohemia with the catchment areas of the Vltava, Lužnice, Malše, and Blanice rivers, later also of Berounka, Otava, and Sázava. Since August 11, 2002, the water masses from the Eger and Biela rivers in Northwest Bohemia were added. Within nine days in August, the affected regions received rainfall equivalent to three summer months of the long-term average amount. Above-average rainfall had already occurred in June and July, and the soil's storage capacity was exhausted. Initially, numerous places in the flat area around České Budějovice were flooded, and the emerging danger was underestimated. The Vltava's dams, filled to the brim, should have released about 1000 m³/s of water as a precaution, which would have mitigated the later peak. At the beginning of the second week, the water level in Prague rose to seven meters. Now the overflows had to be opened. Along with the South Bohemian water masses from the Vltava at 3000 m³/s, an additional 2000 m³/s came from the unregulated rivers Sázava and Berounka before Prague. In Prague, the normal flow is 150 m³/s, but at that time an estimated 5300 m³/s was reached. The flooding of the Old Town was prevented by barriers on the riverbanks. However, the subway ceased operations. The district of Karlín had to be evacuated. At the confluence of the Vltava and Elbe rivers near Mělník, the water masses could spread into the plain. The village of Zálezlice, located near the mouth, was two-thirds destroyed. At the downstream bottleneck of the Bohemian Switzerland, the water backed up. The crossing into Germany occurs through the narrow Elbe valley of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The peak level in Ústí nad Labem (Aussig) was reached on the afternoon of August 16, 2002. The water flow of the Elbe exceeded the previous highest level from 1845. The water volume in the Vltava exceeded the amount from 1845 by almost one-fifth."

Around 1,000 animals were evacuated from the Prague Zoo, but 134 others (including 10 mammals) died in the floods. The Prague Metro was filled to two-fifths and could only be fully operational again in March 2003. The damage to the subway amounted to around 280 million euros. Near the confluence of the Vltava and Elbe rivers, the Czech chemical and pharmaceutical plant Spolana in Neratovice was flooded, washing away waste and operating materials. One of the 17 flood victims was a 53-year-old man who was fatally struck by a metal shard while watching the explosion of a free-floating inland ship in Děčín."

The SPD-led federal government reacted immediately to the flood disaster and initiated the largest deployment of the Bundeswehr in the country since its existence. As early as August 20, 2002, about 45,000 soldiers of the Bundeswehr were deployed in the affected regions to reinforce dikes, carry out evacuations, and coordinate disaster relief. Numerous politicians, including Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, regularly visited the affected areas under significant media attention. The federal government quickly allocated 385 million euros to support the people affected by the flood in their rebuilding efforts. Payments amounted to 500 euros per person and up to 2,000 euros per household. Affected businesses received a flat rate of 15,000 euros and 500 euros per employee. On August 26, the federal government decided on a draft law for a 7.1 billion euro state fund for reconstruction aid in the flood areas, which the Bundesrat approved on September 13. A political science study concludes that the flood relief measures of the SPD-led German federal government increased the SPD's share of votes in the affected areas by at most seven percentage points in the 2002 federal elections and by two percentage points in the 2005 federal elections. Critics argue that politics and administration drew very few actual consequences from the flood. Of the 35,000 hectares of land identified in 2002 as potential flood areas along the Elbe, less than five percent were realized. Additionally, building bans provided for in various state laws were often circumvented by district administrators with exceptions."

Due to the flood disaster, the Schüssel I government, with the approval of the FPÖ ministers, decided to postpone the tax reform that had been promised to voters by the FPÖ. This and other differences of opinion prompted Haider and other members of the right-wing party wing, such as Ewald Stadler, to demand the convening of a special party congress (Knittelfeld FPÖ Assembly 2002) from the party leadership, which was considered more liberal under Susanne Riess-Passer, and to collect signatures from the elected delegates. The events of this assembly led to a power shift within the party, the resignation of several FPÖ ministers, thus breaking the first FPÖ-ÖVP coalition under Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, and ultimately to early elections (National Council election in Austria 2002), in which the FPÖ lost almost two-thirds of its voters. The Freedom Party also lost significant voter support in most state elections (except in Carinthia) between 2003 and 2005. In the municipal council and mayoral elections in Carinthia in 2003, municipal council elections in Lower Austria in 2005, and later also in Styria, the FPÖ had to forfeit voters. After the electoral defeat in the municipal council elections in Lower Austria in 2005, the former chairman of the FPÖ, Jörg Haider, proposed a re-establishment of the FPÖ as a \"casual, lively, and young\" party, whose leadership he would be willing to take over \"in case of emergency.\" When this proposal did not receive unanimous support within the party, and a contested vote against the Vienna FPÖ chairman Heinz-Christian Strache was anticipated at a party congress scheduled for April 23, he announced on April 4, 2005, the founding of the new party Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) and expressed his desire to become its first chairman. The BZÖ subsequently replaced the FPÖ in the Schüssel II government."

Affected were, among others, the Czech tributaries Vltava and Eger, parts of the two Mulde rivers, and almost the entire course of the Elbe from Hradec Králové (Krieggrätz) through the Czech and Saxon upper reaches to the northern German middle and lower reaches. Especially in the lower middle reaches, the flood is comparable to the flood of 2002, but it passed through the river course in a much longer flood wave. In early April, some towns, such as Hitzacker in Lower Saxony, were largely flooded. The mark of the century flood of 2002 was reached or even exceeded in some places. In Lauenburg, this happened as early as April 7."

                "content": "The trigger for the flooding was strong thawing in the low mountain ranges upstream of the Elbe. In the ridge areas of the Ore Mountains, the Bohemian Forest, and the Giant Mountains, snow depths of over 1.5 meters accumulated throughout the winter. Due to previous short thaw processes and the long duration of snow cover, the snow was relatively strongly compressed and rich in water. At the end of March, a strong temperature spike and high precipitation led to the rapid melting of the snow masses. In the Ore Mountains, precipitation was relatively low, so there was no dangerous flooding in the tributaries of the upper Elbe. At the beginning of March, there were already floods in these waters, which appeared more dangerous due to ice shifts. Heavy rainfall occurred at the end of March, particularly in southern Czechia and the central Bohemian Basin. Further causes must be sought for the significant swelling of the river in the lower middle course. On the one hand, dike systems were raised and renewed along entire stretches in southern Saxony-Anhalt since 2002. These held back the Elbe and prevented the flooding of retention areas as in 2002. This is accompanied by unfavorable river engineering. Another reason for exceeding the flood mark of 2002 north of Magdeburg lies in the stretched flood wave, which triggered the highest alarm levels simultaneously over the several hundred kilometers stretch from Lower Saxony to the confluence of the Vltava. In the middle course, the flow velocity decreased, leading to the compression of the wave."

Aside from disruptions in road traffic (closure of numerous riverside roads and the Loschwitz Bridge), Dresden was little affected by the flood. The district of Gohlis, whose dike is designed for 7.40 meters, was the most at risk. Cities like Bad Schandau, Pirna, and Meißen were flooded more severely than Dresden. In Dresden, most of the damage was caused by flooded basements, although there were also isolated cases, such as in Zschieren, where houses were flooded.

Here, these air masses warm up and absorb a lot of moisture. After crossing the Alps towards the north, they encounter the cold air there, cool down significantly, and extreme precipitation occurs in a relatively short time. This weather situation was also the cause of the Oder flood (1997) and the Elbe flood (2002)."

                "content": "Starting from September 24, 2010, there were widespread heavy rainfall in the Elbe-Elster region. Between the Fläming and the Saxon Upper Lusatia, more than 100 liters of rain per square meter fell from September 24 to September 27. As a result, on September 29, flood warning level 4 was reached at the Schwarze Elster and its two tributaries, Große Röder and Pulsnitz, which flow into it near Elsterwerda. After alarm level 3 had to be declared the day before throughout the Elbe-Elster district and a crisis team was formed, District Administrator Christian Jaschinski was forced to declare a disaster alarm at 11:50 AM on that day. Due to rising water levels, preparations began in Elsterwerda for the voluntary evacuation of the city center, which was at risk of flooding, where the water level of the Schwarze Elster had risen to about 3.50 meters. The official gauge in Bad Liebenwerda, located about ten kilometers downstream, also measured 3.50 meters. By evening, the tense situation required the first roads and bridges to be closed. While the newly constructed important Elster Bridge in Elsterwerda remained open, bridges leading over the Schwarze Elster in Saathain and Bad Liebenwerda, as well as the partially flooded federal highway 169 near Plessa, the district road 6207 between Saathain and Stolzenhain, and the local road through Schmerkendorf had to be closed. In Ortrand, where the Pulsnitz overflowed, the federal highway A 13 also had to be closed due to flooding. The escalating situation also attracted increased media interest, with several television teams from public and private broadcasting stations reporting live from the region. On Thursday, September 30, all schools in Elsterwerda, Bad Liebenwerda, and Herzberg, as well as schools in Annaburg for students affected by the flood, were closed. On that day, record high water levels were measured at all gauges along the Schwarze Elster, reaching previously unrecorded values. The measured peak discharge of the Schwarze Elster in Löben was now 128 m³/s, corresponding to a discharge characteristic of HQ 200. The water level in Bad Liebenwerda reached an unprecedented absolute high of 3.55 meters during the night. From then on, it began to slightly decrease here, while the levels in the downstream locations continued to rise. The situation remained critical at the increasingly softening dikes of the Schwarze Elster. Weak points and cracks, such as between Kotschka and Saathain, where the dike began to flood over a length of about 50 meters, were sealed as quickly as possible by emergency services and the help of residents who rushed to assist with sandbags. For safety reasons, voluntary evacuation of about 2,700 residents began in Elsterwerda at that time, with announcements made via loudspeakers from police vehicles driving through the city and public postings urging them to leave their homes and properties. The district hospital located in close proximity to the river was also evacuated using ambulances and helicopters. About 100 patients were transferred from there to nearby hospitals in Herzberg, Finsterwalde, Lauchhammer, Riesa, Großenhain, or Dresden within about four hours. Despite all the efforts of the emergency services, a disaster occurred the following day about twenty kilometers upstream from the mouth of the Elster. On October 1, at around 12:50 PM, the left dike of the Schwarze Elster broke near Meuselko at a water level of 3.34 m, measured at the Löben gauge. Just over four hours later, at around 5:00 PM, a disaster alarm was finally declared for the entire Wittenberg district. Eight hours later, parts of the village of Löben, located two kilometers downstream, were flooded, and the district of Waltersdorf was cut off from the outside world. The prolonged peak of the flood meant that the disaster alarm for the Elbe-Elster district, except for the city of Herzberg/Elster, was only lifted on October 6. On October 7, with the permanent drop below flood warning level 4 at the Löben gauge, the disaster alarm for the Wittenberg district and the city of Herzberg was lifted. The dike that broke at Meuselko over a length of about 30 meters was closed on October 5, while levels remained constant and were still rising in some areas."

Immediate damages caused by the flooding to hydraulic structures in the Wittenberg district are estimated at 670,000 euros. The preliminary estimated costs for dike renovation in Brandenburg (as of 2011) are reported to be up to 50 million euros, with another 50 million euros planned by the state of Saxony-Anhalt for the renovation of dikes on the Schwarze Elster by 2020. In the eastern part of the Annaburger Heide, several hectares of forest were destroyed due to the overall more than five-month flooding and a high groundwater level caused by the flood."

The extensive floodplain forests adjacent to the river and the meandering course of the Black Elster disappeared, as recurring floods no longer had the opportunity to use these areas as compensation spaces, which also caused the water levels to rise with each flood, leading to further expansion of flood protection facilities. Just a few years after the regulation of the Black Elster began, the newly constructed dikes broke in 1861 due to a flood. Flooding was also reported in the years 1862, 1871, 1895, and 1907. Another devastating flood on the Black Elster became known in 1926. A breach of the Röder dam near the small village of Würdenhain flooded the entire village on June 18, 1926. The flood affected almost all the rivers in the area, including Röder, Pulsnitz, Black Elster, and Little Elster, causing enormous damage. In the floodplain of the then district of Bad Liebenwerda, two-thirds of the harvest were destroyed that year. Downstream, an area of up to 144 hectares of flooded land was reported in the Mönchenhöfe area. In June of the following year, during the summer flood, a breach of the Elster dam occurred near Mückenberg (Lauchhammer-West), which could only be closed with great difficulty."

However, due to its intensity and the extensive urban transformations it triggered, it holds ongoing significance in the city's history. The flood is considered the culmination and northern endpoint of a geographically broad flood situation that dominated the course of the Upper and Middle Weser as well as some of its source and tributary rivers at that time. Flood peaks caused by rain and snowmelt of the Weser and its tributary Aller converged near Verden. In Bremen, the floodwater encountered a critical river bend at the Weser dam, which had a significantly reduced outflow cross-section, and instead sought a new bed. As a result, two summer dike breaches occurred immediately above and below the dam. Over 120 allotment gardens were destroyed, causing massive landscape damage. Although the plots were located in the designated overflow area and the flood remained within its limits, hardly anyone had expected that a flood of such magnitude would occur \"from above\" – that is, as an inland flood. All dike construction measures up to that point had been aimed at protecting the gardeners from storm surges from the sea. In the wake of the Weser breakthrough, the responsible authorities designed a new flood management concept for the affected areas, which was gradually implemented in the following years. Relocations, expansions, and new constructions of dikes, roads, and waterways permanently changed the cityscape."

                "content": "Essentially, the Weser breakthrough in 1981 affected the southern Bremen district of Habenhausen, which is part of the Obervieland district. However, there were also landscape damages in other districts. Habenhausen – a neighborhood that was then still almost exclusively characterized by residential development – is bordered by the Weser to the east and north. The river makes a tight bend to the west around the district, where the Weser weir is located. The old structure, which still existed in 1981, was built between 1906 and 1911 to create an artificial boundary for the tides and simultaneously to ensure a minimum water level for inland shipping through a weir. It separates the Middle Weser from the Lower Weser. Within this sharp river bend, a wide area with grassland and small garden areas opens up, which today occupies about one-fifth of the area of Habenhausen. The heaviest destruction due to the flood was recorded in this area. The area is shielded from the Weser only by low summer dikes; only immediately before the regular residential development further south does a winter dike protect the houses. With the Werder Bridge (officially known today as Karl-Carstens Bridge, colloquially referred to as Strawberry Bridge), Habenhausen has had a long connection to the north to the district of Hastedt, which belongs to the Hemelingen district, since 1971. At the southern foot of the bridge, there was a notable bend in the winter dike in 1981, which the floodwater pressed against with full current intensity. This spot was later straightened. The second significant body of water in Habenhausen is the then 2.7-kilometer-long Werdersee. It was created between 1953 and 1960 in an east-west direction according to plans by Wilhelm Hübotter, south of the city weir, as a flood channel and ended in 1981 about 180 meters west of the bridge. It was intended that the lake should protect Habenhausen from storm surges if dikes broke along the Weser, which flows almost parallel further north. Additionally, it was meant to absorb floodwater that – like the Weser breakthrough – originated east in the designated overflow area of the Weser bend. The lake extended to the west up to the dike chart path, which ran on a small dam in a southwest-northeast direction. On the other side of the dam, the Kleine Weser continued, a small tributary of the Weser. There was only a connection between the Werdersee and the Kleine Weser through a few small openings."

                "content": "On November 13, 1980, a routine flushing of the weir chamber was carried out in the left sector of the Bremen Weserwehr, which had been put into operation in 1911. A defect occurred when the sector, due to advanced corrosion of the locking structure, broke through the upper end position and destroyed the seals. It could be reset immediately after the damage incident, preventing the outflow of the dam. By December 24 of the same year, the damaged seals were partially renewed; however, an emergency locking mechanism still made control of the sector impossible. As a result, a serious problem arose: the more water flowed downstream, the more the functioning right weir field was burdened, while at the same time the outflow was increasingly slowed down. According to calculations, only 1,500 m³ of water could flow out regularly. In the early days of March the following year, maritime polar air flowed into Germany, bringing light rain or snowfall. At that time, the snow cover in the Harz was slightly above the long-term average. Between March 6 and 11, several low-pressure systems moved northeast across Germany, initially bringing tropical warm air and, from March 10, again maritime polar air. This resulted in partly prolonged rainfall, which was particularly abundant from March 9 to 11 (for example, in the area of Hameln or with 96 mm on the Kahlen Asten and 131 mm in the Sankt Andreasberg district of Oderbrück) and, together with rapid snowmelt in the low mountain ranges – for example, in the Weserbergland and in the Rhön – quickly caused the Weser and Aller tributaries from the low mountain ranges to swell. Favorable temperatures also caused the snow in the Harz to melt almost completely. The volumes of water flowing from the mountains exceeded the flood storage capacities of the Eder and Diemel dams; three reservoirs in the West Harz also overflowed. Although the peak wave of the Fulda was significantly ahead of that of the Werra, considerable flooding already occurred at the Upper Weser. The peak of the flood passed the Weser gauge at Hannoversch Münden on March 12 and reached the gauges in Vlotho and Porta Westfalica on March 14. The Middle Weser area was also affected by the flood situation, particularly downstream of the confluence with the also flood-prone Aller. Thus, the immense influx caused the outflow of the Weser to swell to critical levels, leading to the flooding of the meadows at Thedinghausen. Initially, this did not provoke any press reports, as these uninhabited areas were often at least partially underwater. Between March 12 and 14, further rain fell from west to east due to low-pressure systems. Only from March 15, with significantly lowered temperatures, did little precipitation fall. However, in some places above Bremen, the winter dikes soon came under threat, and on March 12, the Weser-Kurier informed in a small, 18-line report under the headline \"Flood wave endangers the allotments\" for the first time about an impending flood in the Hanseatic city. Subsequently, various allotment gardeners in the city began to clear their houses located in the officially designated overflow areas. The summer dike, which ran a few hundred meters upstream of the Weserwehr on the left bank, was designed for up to 1,300 m³ of water per second. Therefore, flooding was expected on March 13, which would have resulted in flooding of the adjacent allotment areas Hastedter Bulten and Fresenbulten before the water could have been directed back into the river via the overflow channels Werdersee and Kleine Weser. Initially, this did not occur, but was then scheduled by experts for the early morning hours of March 14; however, it did not happen again. Meanwhile, at the Weserwehr, due to the exceptionally high water level, there was hardly any noticeable difference in level between the gauges of the Middle and Lower Weser."

                "header": "The breakthrough",
                "content": "The first serious damage from the flooding occurred in Bremen on the morning of March 15, when around 7 a.m. the riverbank path below the so-called \"Wehrschloss\" on the right bank began to sag directly at the weir. The fire department dispatched twelve emergency vehicles and secured already slipped trees with wire ropes – on one hand to avoid hindering shipping should they fall into the river, and on the other hand, to use them as a natural protective barrier for the riverbank. Four trees (poplars and beeches) had to be cut down, and 18 others were tied down with steel cables. By noon, however, the water had washed away three meters of the bank. The backflow at the defective weir caused the Weser River – as had been expected for two days – to overflow the summer dike, which was between 6.50 and 6.70 meters high, partially washing it away. After the westward flowing water poured over fields, grasslands, and bird meadows, the designated flood channel Werdersee was filled, but the majority of the flood unexpectedly flowed further north, destroying several allotment garden areas in the process. About 120 meters east of the Karl-Carstens Bridge, the water crashed from the land side onto the summer dike (on the left Weser bank) and stressed it so much that it gave way and broke around 3 p.m. Within an hour, this breach had enlarged many times over. Thus, the water flowed back more than four kilometers upstream from the point where the Werdersee would have had its regular inlet. About 100 allotment plots were swept into the Weser. The water police attempted to stop and secure floating huts, cars, and detached boats with small tugs. This was only partially successful six kilometers further downstream. The river had bypassed the weir in a short distance and created a new, deep bed within a few hours. A large part of the Weser water was now flowing around the weir on the left side. Quickly, this stream – from the overflowed summer dike at the Middle Weser through the overcrowded area occupied by plots to the breach of the winter dike and backflow into the Lower Weser – was designated as the \"Neue Weser.\" The water also caused severe damage along the banks of the targeted flood channel. Particularly affected was the dike bend of the winter dike at the Karl-Carstens Bridge, as the water pressed directly against this projection. Around 6 p.m., an inflow of 1850 m³ per second with an increasing trend was measured at the weir. The police closed the roads leading directly into the flood area, including the accesses and approaches to the Weser weir. In the evening, about 3.3 kilometers in a straight line from the main flooding area, a breach occurred in the road leading from the Buntentors-Deichschart in Bremen Neustadt to the \"Kuhhirten\" restaurant on the Stadtwerder. It separated the Werdersee from the Kleine Weser with its dam. The breach allowed for better drainage of the Werdersee, which, although it contributed only slightly to the rapid improvement of the situation, resulted in the lake emptying into the Kleine Weser after the peak of the flood. The next day, March 16, a new flood wave of 1900 m³ per second turned the already wide breach in the winter dike from the previous day into a powerful stream that swept away another 50 plots into the river. The water flowed back into the Weser but was not absorbed by its current; instead, it pressed further downstream against the bank on the opposite right riverbank, causing significant damage there as well. Trees that had previously been secured with steel cables were washed away. In some places, the bank eroded up to five meters. The promenade between the fish ladder – where the force of the water broke apart the concrete boxes – and the Jakobsberg sports field completely sank, for example. The Hemelinger harbor facilities on the right Weser bank above the weir were also flooded knee-deep despite high sheet pile walls. Work had to be halted in the Allerhafen. Water seeped out between the gates that had sealed off the roads to the harbor. Sandbag barriers were erected in the area of the feeder to the A1 motorway. While in the afternoon a Weser outflow of up to 2,650 m³ per second was reported from Verden, despite the efforts of the helpers who had now arrived, the promenade at the dike bend at the bridge slid down by two-thirds by noon. If the winter dike had broken here, large parts of the residential areas of Habenhausen would have been flooded. It was considered to dig a channel for water intake immediately west of the bridge, but the work took too long. At 5 p.m., 200 helpers from the fire department, the Technical Relief Organization, and the riot police began constructing a relief dam from the damaged dike bend to the bridge base. On the morning of the following day, March 17, this dam was completed around 4 a.m., and the flood risk for Habenhausen was temporarily averted. On both days, March 15 and 16, the grotesque image of the devastated allotment gardens attracted thousands of onlookers who gathered on the Werder Bridge. They sometimes cheered individual huts that were swept into the Weser. Even snack stands were set up on the slightly elevated foot and bike path. The police had up to 120 officers on site at times and struggled to keep the roadway clear for vehicle traffic. During the flood and especially in the aftermath, the behavior of the \"disaster tourists\" was heavily criticized. A total of about 550 allotment gardeners were affected by the flood, with the Hastedter Bulten e.V. being hit harder than the neighboring Fresenbulten e.V., where initially only about 40 huts were underwater. Around 6 a.m. on March 17, the road surface of Hannoversche Straße in Hemelingen partially collapsed, presumably due to undermining from the flooded Allerhafen. By late afternoon, the water level at the Weser weir had fallen by six centimeters, and the feared weir break was thus temporarily no longer a concern. Nevertheless, in the now 150-meter-wide \"Neue Weser,\" erosion of up to twelve meters deep was observed. In this area, in addition to the allotments, eight network stations of the municipal utilities (now swb AG) were destroyed. By the afternoon of March 18, the water level at the Weser weir had fallen from 7.04 to 6.95 meters, according to the Bremen Water Management Office. In the residential area located immediately behind the softened dike on the southern edge of the flood area, the fire department had to pump out basements on Habenhauser Dorfstraße and Holzdamm. As the peak of the disaster seemed to have been surpassed, another small embankment above the Weser weir on the left bank – the so-called Bootshafendeich at the marina of the Oberweser Sailing Club e.V. – broke at 2 a.m. on the night of March 19, and in the following days, the local sheet pile walls, a small land spit, and the regatta tower were washed away. Although club members erected sandbag and stone barriers, they could only limit the washouts and not stop them. This resulted in the Weser weir being further relieved, but on the other hand, the \"Neue Weser\" was additionally nourished with several million cubic meters of water. Consequently, the breakthrough back into the Weser east of the Werder Bridge intensified again throughout the morning. Around 1 p.m., another section – about 30 meters east of the bridge – was washed out, measuring 15 meters long and five meters deep from the earth of the dike. The additional water masses caused significant damage again on the opposite Weser bank after the backflow into the Weser, where they crashed at nearly a right angle. Although the Water Management Office made efforts to fill the holes in the bank, it was largely unsuccessful. By around 10 a.m., the Hastedter allotment area Im Suhrfelde had been evacuated as a precaution. Subsequently, both the Osterdeich between Stader Straße and Weser weir and, due to concerns about structural integrity, the Werder Bridge were closed to all traffic for several days. The \"Neue Weser\" continued to carve deeper into the subsoil of the fields, allotment gardens, and marshes hour by hour, so that the flow velocity in the area of Hastedter Bulten initially changed little. The Weser outflow fell to 960 m³ per second by March 24, but the water receded only slowly from the flood areas. It was not until April that an average water flow was reestablished at the weir. Just under two months later, on June 9, another flood with a peak flow rate of 1100 m³ per second reached the Hanseatic city but remained largely without consequences."

                "content": "Five days after the first breakthrough of the Weser into the overflow areas, the securing and later cleanup work began. On the morning of March 20, during one of the regular static measurements at the Werder Bridge, it was found that one of the pillars had twisted by one and a half centimeters. A seven-meter-deep hole had formed around it. However, the authorities stated that there was no danger. To support the pillar, on the same day, they began lowering normal stones as well as over 150 tetrapods and so-called delta stones at the relevant location. Additionally, the officials at the water management office voted for the construction of a pontoon bridge over the water surface of the \"New Weser,\" which was to follow the course of the interrupted weir road and be built by the Bundeswehr. It was planned that starting March 23, trucks would transport stones to fill the breach in the dike above the weir over the bridge. The dike closure work was to begin at the site of the Oberweser Sailing Club, where the \"New Weser\" started at a width of 180 meters. Also on March 20, the budget committee of the finance deputation allocated 500,000 D-marks to be advanced for dike repairs. Meanwhile, the SPD local association in Hastedt called on the Senate and its own citizens' faction to restore the recreational and green areas in the district between the weir and Jakobsberg as quickly as possible. On March 22, 150 soldiers from the floating bridge battalion 160 from Minden and the heavy pioneer battalion 11 from Dörverden began constructing a 500-meter-long steel mat road on a sand bed from the southern beginning of the weir road in the Habenhauser residential area directly towards the Middle Weser over the flooded meadows. A prior reconnaissance had shown that the original plan – construction along the weir road – was not possible. The current in that area would have been too strong for the bridge. Additionally, there were concerns that the Bundeswehr vehicles could get stuck in the mud after a rapid draining of the \"New Weser.\"\n\nOther flood-damaged areas were also taken into account during the rescue operations in those days. On March 22, they began filling the heavily affected weir promenade in Hastedt with slag and natural stones. To prevent the progression and expansion of the breakthrough at the Werder Bridge, a 300-meter-long sheet pile wall was driven across the remaining Hastedter Bulten starting March 23. For this, 16 previously undamaged small garden plots had to be sacrificed. From March 23, a Bundeswehr pontoon ferry also transported machines and filling material to the Oberweser Sailing Club. Initially, a small dam had to be pushed over a creek to the Werraweg before the actual dike construction work could begin with the lowering of tetrapods. They worked on both sides of the breakthrough to better control the current. The open spaces were filled with water construction and slag stones and sealed with a mineral mixture. By March 24, the new dike had already grown to a length of 20 meters. To relieve the \"New Weser\" in the construction area from the excessive water pressure, the weir was set to its lowest possible position to allow additional water to flow out over the \"Old Weser.\" In addition to the previous filling material, employees of the water management office supplemented the construction site starting March 26 from a pontoon maneuvered by rope with initially around 1,000 three-meter-long special sandbags made of nylon. These were intended to help reduce the water flow speed, as otherwise, the filling material of the new dike could be washed away. However, the bags were partially pushed away by the current, so they refocused on stones and tetrapods. On March 28 and 29, there were unexpected delays in closing the dike. The rope of the pontoon broke several times, and Hans-Dieter Bücken, head of the Bremen water management office, stated that they would probably still need about 5,000 special sandbags for the remaining 40 meters. The current of the \"New Weser\" remained very high, and the water was eroding the Hastedter Bulten with a slightly changed impact direction. Individual plots were still being destroyed during these days. In the aftermath of the actual flood disaster, the Weser breakthrough still caused injuries. A construction worker had to be treated in the hospital after getting his leg caught between a freight cart and a device pole on March 29. A major setback occurred at the breach site on April 4 when the current tore a 30-meter-wide hole in the nearly finished dike around 6:30 PM. More than 30,000 tons of natural stones had already been used, but it gave way at its weakest point, where no stones could yet be sunk for transport reasons. In light of this development, Hans-Dieter Bücken emphatically called for the construction of the originally planned pontoon bridge on March 5, as more material was needed and the ferry was not efficient enough. The conditions for bridge construction were now significantly better due to the changed current conditions than they had been two weeks earlier. Subsequently, the pioneers began bridge construction on the evening of April 6, which could be completed by noon on April 7. The bridge consisted of 100 hollow bodies and could carry a weight of 50 tons. After completion, it was used continuously by trucks. In addition to filling the dike breach, cutter dredgers, as a supporting measure, washed sand from the Middle Weser in front of the newly emerging dam. Starting April 8, about 20 tetrapods were to be launched daily. Additionally, it was expected that several thousand tons of stones and filling material would still be needed. In the night of April 9, the dike breach was finally closed. In the following weeks, the area was continuously reinforced and sealed with a mineral mixture. The costs for this spatially limited measure amounted to 3.2 million D-marks. 36,000 tons of filling stones, 3,000 tons of mineral mixture, 635 tetrapods, and over 4,000 sandbags were used. However, during the tidal high water, which affected the Lower Weser up to the Weser weir, the \"New Weser\" still periodically transformed into a river behind the dike, as the incoming tide pressed into the erosion channel through the breach at the Werder Bridge. Nothing changed in this situation throughout the summer. Initially, the water construction experts had to address more pressing issues. For the residents in the area of Werraweg, a temporary path was created on the dike, and on April 9, chief building officer Winfried Reiner from the water and shipping office announced that the steep bank at Jakobsberg in Hastedt would be retracted. It had been pushed too far into the Weser after World War II. Primarily, engineers were to focus on repairing the still defective weir body starting mid-April. On April 9, the head of the Hemelingen local office, Hans Dieter Rissland, demanded that the Hastedter promenade and greenway below the weir be completely restored, as the industrialized district already had very few recreational areas. In that area, a 40-meter-wide section had been washed away. Rissland accused the federal and state authorities of indifference regarding the protection of green spaces. Meanwhile, several dredging ships on the Lower and Middle Weser cleared the river of numerous sandbanks and shallows that had formed due to sedimentation from the flood. By noon on April 14, ships with a draft of up to 2.20 meters were again allowed to navigate the Middle Weser, but only for a limited time: lockages for upstream travel occurred only two hours before and after the tidal high water. Starting April 14, 600 tons of earth were moved to replace the broken dike chart path at the western end of the Werdersee with a temporary sand dam. The filling was to be completed by Easter (April 19) to provide a temporary connection for pedestrians and cyclists. If the water level of the lake rose again, the path connection was to be maintained via a pontoon bridge. Local politicians from Neustadt demanded that the Werdersee be temporarily dammed again to revive the local recreational factor and limit ecological damage. However, the bottom would first need to be cleaned of debris. Together with the water management office, the Bremen dike association began in May to repair the damages to the Habenhauser winter dike along a length of one kilometer on the left bank of the Weser. The extremely endangered dike bend at the foot of the Werder Bridge was also straightened. The renovated dike section is one kilometer long. 50,000 cubic meters of clay soil had to be moved for these measures, and 60,000 square meters of embankment and foreland areas were reseeded. The Werdersee tributary at the foot of the dike was filled with 75,000 cubic meters of sand. Dietrich Harborth, spokesperson for the building senator, predicted at a meeting of the Neustadt local council on May 6 that the Werdersee would probably not be used by the public as a sports and recreational area until at least 1983. He explained that the lake was completely silted up and might need to be manually excavated. If machines were used for sand removal, the insulating clay layer would break. When news of another impending flood reached Bremen, the recently completed dike above the weir was hastily raised from five to six meters for 80,000 D-marks and with the help of several thousand cubic meters of clay soil starting June 4. The flood passed without consequences, allowing focus to shift to work at the western end of the disaster area. Starting June 11, the plans from mid-April were implemented, and dredging and cleaning of the Werdersee began – despite the sensitive clay soil with heavy machinery. The silt removed was at least partially used to fill the edges of the Hastedter Bulten. On July 2, Hans-Dieter Bücken informed the Obervieland local council about the progress of the plans. The work on the Habenhauser winter dike, which had begun in May, was nearing completion, with a flattening of the embankment and a widening of the crown path. Repairs were to be completed by the end of August. Bücken pointed out that the filling of the Werdersee tributary was necessary because it ran too close to the foot of the dike and could soften it during high water. The summer dikes were also to be closed and supplemented again. Additionally, a clay wall was planned for better protection of the bank edge. SPD local politician Egon Hartwig expressed the view that the landscape altered by the \"New Weser\" could later also be used as a recreational area. On August 10, the awarding committee of the building deputation decided on five construction and planning measures in the flood-damaged floodplain. Among other things, the weir road was to be rebuilt for 670,000 D-marks in accordance with its former course, but this time elevated. The dam received three water passages. Even more important was the decision to close the backflow breakthrough in the Hastedter Bulten. It was feared that otherwise, the winter storm floods would lead to renewed flooding of the meadows and the remaining small gardens. The gaping hole was to be sealed with a new dike six meters high, on which a two-meter-wide asphalted foot and bike path was to be laid. The costs for this were estimated at 2.5 million D-marks. The costs to restore the revetment on the southern shore of the lake over a length of one and a half kilometers were estimated at one million D-marks. On September 1, this construction site at the Werder Bridge was established. Initially, 25,000 tons of sand from the \"New Weser\" were piled up to form a dam; the same amount was supplied by dredging below the Stephanibrücke. The sand core, the cover layer of clay soil, and the dike crown were secured with a 60-centimeter-thick layer of stones. The angle of the dike slope allowed for water overflow in case of emergency. To reinforce and secure the new dike, a steel sheet pile wall was driven parallel to the Weser, connecting to the one from spring. It later disappeared into the revetment and was no longer visible. To continue ensuring a connection between the \"New Weser\" and the river and thus maintain water exchange, the construction workers laid a pipeline with a sluice through the dam. A flap at the Weser end of the pipe closed under the water pressure during incoming tide, thus preventing a rise in water in the \"New Weser.\" On September 17, the breakthrough site could be closed by bulldozers at 11:05 AM – 186 days after its formation. The \"New Weser,\" now re-diked on both sides, had thus become a lake. By the end of the day, the dike was further raised to three meters. In total, 35,000 cubic meters of sand, 10,000 tons of filling stones, and an additional 10,000 cubic meters of clay soil for stabilization were needed for this dike closure. By the end of October, the repair and renovation work at the Weser weir could also be completed. The costs for restoring flood protection burdened Bremen with nine million and the federal government with 13 million D-marks in 1981."

                "content": "Already on March 16, just one day after the dike breach, Bremen's mayor Hans Koschnick reminded that the affected small garden areas had been designated as overflow areas and therefore the city could not be legally held liable for compensation payments. However, he promised a favorable review of financial assistance by the Senate, as the deficit of small gardens should not be increased. To free the city from demands for compensation, Building Senator Bernd Meyer critically noted on the same day that Johann Dreyer, chairman of the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends, stated that the affected individuals did not want or could bear the water damage alone. Despite the financial plight of the state, the Senate had to help the small gardeners, especially since the flooding area also served as a local recreation area for tens of thousands of Bremen residents. He emphasized that the damages were not insured but also admitted that every small gardener was aware of the risk of owning a hut in the designated overflow area. His association called for a fundraising campaign on March 18, as neither he nor the affected individuals could replace the damages even remotely. The chairman of the opposition FDP parliamentary group, Horst-Jürgen Lahmann, pointed out the next day that the small gardeners were aware of the risks of their location and therefore could not expect compensation from the state or city budget. He proposed a tax deferral as an alternative. This idea was taken up by Finance Senator Moritz Thape on March 20, when he decided, with the approval of Federal Finance Minister Hans Matthöfer, on a regulation for tax assistance for flood-affected citizens. Thus, tax debts could now be deferred upon request, advance payments on income, corporate, and trade taxes adjusted, and enforcement actions suspended. Also on March 19, the small gardeners intensified their own relief efforts. The Federal Association of German Garden Friends called on its ten state associations to organize fundraising campaigns, and independently, the State Association of Garden Friends in Hamburg pledged its support and assistance. Furthermore, the SPD local association Hastedt announced that it would conduct a fundraising campaign among the population and local businesses. On March 22, the Bremen small gardener association Werder decided at a general meeting that each member should donate 15 D-Mark. The board intended to increase the total amount from the association's funds to 7,500 D-Mark. The association also reserved five newly created plots for the flood victims. At the same time, the SPD parliamentary group made its own assessment of the situation on site in the flood area. Parliamentary group leader Klaus Wedemeier pointed out that the Weser was a federal waterway. Therefore, the regulation of damages could not essentially be a Bremen matter. On March 23, Building Senator Meyer offered the affected individuals quick and unbureaucratic assistance from the state government. From now on, 100 new plots could be created in the Wolfskuhle park in the Kattenturm district, for which the Senate would provide 1.2 million D-Mark. At that time, around 10,000 D-Mark had already been received in the small gardeners' donation account. A large automobile factory had sent a check for 1,000 D-Mark and also offered \"quick and unconventional help.\" Another company provided the small gardeners with fertilizers and peat products for a fresh start free of charge. Following urgent requests, the board of the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends received approval on March 28 at a general meeting in the Lower German Theater from the 276 delegates to allocate 100,000 D-Mark from the association's assets. Additionally, a solidarity levy of ten D-Mark per member for the Hastedter Bulten association was decided. By that time, 307,000 D-Mark in donations had been raised. The next day, March 29, the benefiting small gardeners of Hastedter Bulten held an extraordinary meeting with 500 members and relatives in the community hall on Drakenburger Straße. They called on the Senate not only to provide them with the compensation areas at Wolfskuhle but also to help them financially. Furthermore, the authorities had to \"fully restore\" the small garden area as soon as the water had receded. In a letter to Johann Dreyer dated May 5, Meyer announced that a perspective for joint action had been found, which should be perceived as fair, especially by the flood-affected small gardeners: \"The clarification of the legal situation revealed that appropriate compensation must be paid by Bremen for the plots claimed on the sheet pile wall route.\" Although, due to a lack of legal basis, no compensation for flood damage could be considered for private individuals, the Senate agreed to help the affected small gardeners—those who wanted to continue—financially and through services from the offices. There should be no distinction between the establishment of a new garden and the takeover of an existing free garden. \"Moreover, I will advocate for a quick decision to ensure that in these cases, leaf loans of up to 7,000 Marks can be granted,\" Meyer continued. On the same day, recipient Dreyer estimated the damage at 1.2 million D-Mark. He stated that the small gardeners wanted to raise 300,000 from solidarity donations themselves, and 30,000 D-Mark had been donated so far by outsiders. The next day, on May 6, he increased his damage assessment to 1.5 million D-Mark and stated that no politician had yet promised concrete help—which, however, contradicts the offers of assistance from the city. However, on the same day, Ludwig Meyer, chairman of the most severely affected small garden association Hastedter Bulten, expressed similar sentiments. He found it outrageous that Bremen politicians had not yet made any proposals to alleviate the plight even almost two months after the flood. However, the small gardeners were pleased with the spontaneous willingness to help that they received from the population and associations from across the country. By the end of the first week of May, 65,000 D-Mark in donations had already been collected. Additionally, various garden associations from the Hanseatic city provided over 17,000 D-Mark, and the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends contributed 300,000. Its chairman Dreyer emphatically pointed out that the members felt abandoned. The argument that the small gardeners had known from the beginning how endangered their settlement area was was not accepted by him: After a visit from the CDU parliamentary group in Obervieland, its chairman, opposition leader, and CDU state chairman Bernd Neumann called on May 7 for unbureaucratic help for all small gardeners who had lost their plots in Hastedter Bulten. They had informed themselves about the flood damage, which must now be estimated between 40 and 50 million D-Mark, Neumann continued. Almost word for word, SPD building deputies and members of the board of the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends reaffirmed their willingness to help the victims quickly and unbureaucratically after a joint discussion on the same day. At the same time, the Social Democratic deputies appealed to the small gardeners to make more use of the replacement garden offer at Wolfskuhle. After all, leaf loans of up to 7,000 D-Mark would be granted for this, regardless of income. The operating company of the city hall organized a benefit concert on May 13 as part of the relief efforts—officially referred to as \"Bunter Abend\"—for the benefit of the affected individuals. All artists and catering businesses waived their fees or revenues. They expected 5,000 spectators in the city hall and a corresponding revenue of about 100,000 D-Mark. The nearly four-hour event under the motto \"Bremen helps Bremen\" was moderated by Jo Hannes Müller and Manfred Ebel. In addition to Heinz Eckner, Rudi Carrell, the pop band Ebony, the Friedel-Ropers choirs, the dance formation \"Bremer Schlüssel,\" singer Rolf Simson, and the Three Sihoclas, the A-Team in Modern Latin formation dance from TSG Bremerhaven, which was the reigning world champion at the time, also performed. Furthermore, chamber singer Georg Koch and soprano Helga Hildebrand from the Bremen Theater, as well as Erika Rumpsfeld and Hans Rolf Radula from the Lower German Stage, appeared. The musical arrangement of the evening was provided by the Bremen Entertainment Orchestra under the direction of Herbert Plümecke, the Army Music Corps 11 from Grohn under the direction of Captain Wintering, and the Music Corps of the Bremen Protection Police under the direction of Max Milde. The Bremen-born James Last could not attend the evening due to a stay in the USA but donated 100 long-playing records, which were sold on-site. Federal President Karl Carstens, also from Bremen, took over the patronage of the event and had greetings conveyed by the president of the parliament, Dieter Klink. However, the \"Bunter Abend\" met with extremely little interest despite numerous media announcements and the presence of prominent artists. Only about 1,000 Bremen residents wanted to experience it—nearly 300 Bundeswehr soldiers were even ordered as \"fillers\" into the largely empty hall. The revenue ultimately amounted to only 15,000 D-Mark. Building official Götz Neuber quoted a report already presented to the parliament regarding damage regulation at a public meeting of the Obervieland local council on June 11, according to which no culpable behavior by public authorities was recognizable. Therefore, the state could not be liable for direct flood damage and losses. Compensation could only be paid by the Senate to those whose property was affected by flood control measures (farmers whose land was used for emergency access routes / small gardeners whose plots were used for driving the sheet pile wall before the bridge's pillar foundation). Within this \"framework of what is legally permissible,\" the senatorial offices were committed to helping the small gardeners and compensating for the damage caused. Economic Senator Karl Willms stated that he wanted to examine in discussions with the Chamber of Agriculture to what extent farmers could be compensated for loss of income. Subsequently, on June 23, there was a controversial debate in the parliament regarding a major inquiry from the CDU parliamentary group. Building Senator Bernd Meyer emphasized that only areas were flooded that \"by their natural function and according to applicable law are to serve as flood discharge.\" This had also been taken into account when approving small garden huts on Hastedter Bulten. Therefore, Bremen could hardly provide financial assistance to the privately affected. However, he reiterated the plan to offer replacement small gardens in the Wolfskuhle area, to grant leaf loans to plot holders, to enable tax relief, and to provide unbureaucratic individual assistance. Peter Willers from the Bremen Green List criticized the confusion of competencies regarding responsibilities between the federal government and the states of Bremen and Lower Saxony. He attributed the flood significantly to the intervention in nature—such as the canalization of the Weser—therefore, the small gardeners certainly had a legal claim to compensation. In the summer, the small gardeners received several large donations. On June 26, Horst Reich, as the first chairman of the Leisure Community Arsten, presented Johann Dreyer with a check for 3,500 D-Mark on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the association, collected from the 116 members. The donations received by that day totaled 220,000 D-Mark. Wolfgang Schreck, head of the Daimler-Benz plant in Sebaldsbrück, handed Dreyer a check for 26,000 D-Mark on July 22. About a year after the Weser breach, 570,000 D-Mark had been raised, donated by Bremen residents for the small gardeners. On August 20, several soldiers from the Heavy Pioneer Battalion 11 from Dörverden visited the small garden association Weserwehr. Its plots on the so-called \"Wehrinsel\" had been completely surrounded by water during the flood but had not been flooded due to their elevated location. Nevertheless, the association members were particularly dependent on the pontoon bridge and wanted to thank for the assistance provided with this meeting. The local council and the local office of Obervieland supported this initiative, \"because the deployment of the Bundeswehr soldiers is not taken for granted, but a committed thank you should be expressed.\""

                "content": "In order to make the largely devastated harbor of the Oberweser Sailing Club e. V. usable again directly at the Weser bend, club chairman Helmut Steinmetz estimated a sum of one million Deutsche Marks on March 20. Only the boathouse and the winter storage halls remained undamaged. In this emergency, the camaraderie of the athletes came into play, and they were taken in as guest moorers by neighboring clubs. The Weser Sailing Club e. V. was affected somewhat less severely, as its grounds are located directly west of the Weser Stadium. By the end of April, a quarter of the capacity of 15 berths for larger dinghies had become silted up and unusable after silt had deposited from the upstream floodplain area behind the club's sheet pile wall. However, chairman Helmut Barenborg stated at the end of April that the club was prohibited from dredging its own harbor bed and dumping the sand into the Weser. Therefore, the Waterways and Shipping Office had to address the problem using floating dredgers and barges. However, this request was denied after a few days. In a letter, the authority rejected the sand extraction, citing the small amount. At the same time, they indicated that they would approve the club's request to flush the silt into the Weser at their own expense. Threatened in its financial existence, the Weser Sailing Club e. V. then sought help from Sports Senator Henning Scherf. At the public meeting of the Obervieland local council on June 11, Scherf promised to organize assistance for the Oberweser Sailing Club, and indeed, Hans-Dieter Bücken informed the council on July 2 that as part of the dike renovations, the bank protection work at the club would also be restored. A point of contention on its grounds was the construction of the harbor boundary. Before the flood, a sheet pile wall had been used as a barrier to the Weser. After the dike closure in early April, there were plans to limit the newly created harbor with a stone embankment. However, this would have significantly narrowed the harbor basin. No one was willing to cover the additional costs of 350,000 Deutsche Marks for the construction of a new sheet pile wall. After lengthy negotiations, the Senate ultimately decided to partially finance the solution favored by the club. Although the Oberweser Sailing Club still had to take on 100,000 Deutsche Marks in debt and cover the costs for the construction of the 95-meter-long landing bridge opposite the sheet pile wall, it was able to be saved. This was made possible not least thanks to donations amounting to 50,000 Deutsche Marks – including from SC Niedersachsen Werder and WV Woltmershausen. On May 9, 1982, the new harbor was inaugurated in the presence of numerous local politicians."

                "content": "The Weser breakthrough of 1981, during which the Weser sought a new bed, is recorded in the city's annals as one of the worst floods in Bremen, even though \"only\" parcels were affected. Although it significantly changed the landscape, it only represents part of the threat at that time, as during those days, a storm surge also reached the Hanseatic city along with the flood of the Upper and Middle Weser. An area of 70 hectares was flooded during the Weser breakthrough, destroying 44 hectares of agricultural land, between 127 and 150 parcel houses on the eastern city island were destroyed, damages amounted to about 56 million Deutsche Marks, and more than 1.5 million cubic meters of soil and sediments were washed into the Weser. Large parts of the affected area were subsequently covered by a layer of silt, mud, and sand, which was contaminated with heavy metal deposits, up to one meter thick. The majority of the uprooted allotments have not been rebuilt. Their location – the breakthrough of the \"New Weser\" back into the river – is now dominated by wild growth. Particularly from a bird's eye view, the course of the flood can still be well traced. The parcel area Hastedter Bulten is thus divided. The water flow at the threshold from the Middle to the Lower Weser increased massively as a result of the Weser breakthrough and the forcibly created additional outflow option. For example, on March 20, only about 300 m³ per second flowed over the weir itself, while 1000 m³ per second sought the path of the \"New Weser.\" As a result, the water level of the Middle Weser upstream to Langwedel fell dramatically in places. In the short term, there were fears that it could drop to 60 to 80 centimeters. Combined with the sandbanks created by the flood, this was one of the main reasons for a nearly month-long closure of the corresponding section of the Weser for inland shipping."

                "content": "In 1981, the Senate commissioned the Franzius Institute for Hydraulic Engineering and Coastal Engineering at the University of Hanover to conduct hydraulic model tests on future flood discharge options in the area of the Weser breakthrough. The large-scale model experiment began at the end of October and cost around 500,000 Deutsche Marks, of which the federal government covered 40% and the state of Bremen 60%. Scientists from the University of Hanover and the Technical University of Braunschweig also began working on this topic in mid-June. An investigation commission was established, which concluded only that the dyke breaches resulted from a chain of unfortunate circumstances. On one hand, the weir should have been repaired much earlier, and on the other hand, the flood protection measures taken in the 1950s \"from above\" – namely the construction of the flood channel – had failed. On April 21, 1983, work began to at least partially refill the deeply excavated bed of the \"New Weser\" east of the Werder Bridge, aside from previous repair and security work. Trucks transported around 125,000 cubic meters of earth to the area in the following months. This was excavated material from the Krimpelsee, located in the districts of Habenhausen and Kattenturm. This effort managed to fill the erosion channel by about two-thirds. However, the future of the \"New Weser\" remained unclear for several years. While the Bremen Water Management Office wanted to wait for the results of the Franzius Institute's report at the end of May 1983, nature conservation experts believed that the habitat interesting for flora and fauna could be preserved regardless of flood protection strategies. Farmers affected by the Weser breakthrough, on the other hand, advocated for refilling the \"New Weser\" to regain lost arable land. Hermann Cordes, a professor of vegetation science and nature conservation at the University of Bremen, explained that remarkable plant species had quickly established themselves along the water's edge. These were primarily species that had previously been counted among the common flora of large primeval river valleys. From an ornithological perspective, the shallow water zones on the Hastedter Bulten were also interesting, as they attracted numerous feeding guests – such as herons and sandpipers. Cordes stated that the area did not necessarily have to be designated as a nature reserve. It could also be preserved as a remarkable landscape formation and recreational area without special protection status. Hans-Dieter Bücken, head of the Water Management Office, also said it was highly unlikely that the \"New Weser\" would have to be removed for flood protection reasons. However, Holger Schmidt, the spokesperson for the Obervieland local council, pointed out that private property had been affected by the \"New Weser.\" Therefore, the farmers' desire to restore the original state was quite understandable. Furthermore, the preservation of the \"New Weser\" and the construction of a nature conservation-friendly inlet facility would be difficult to realize together. During the Weser breakthrough in 1981, the Werdersee had proven to be almost ineffective in its intended protective function: while it protected the Neustadt from storm surges, it could not secure Habenhausen from inland floods of the Middle Weser. This circumstance, the already partially completed remodeling of the dykes, and the still perceived foreign body of the \"New Weser,\" along with the question of how to deal with it, ultimately led to the decision for a large-scale redesign of the area. The holistic and nature-oriented concept aimed to prevent a similar disaster and targeted a more controlled flow of potential floods. The most visible measure was the extension of the still dry Werdersee by 1.07 kilometers eastward beyond the Werder Bridge to protect the structure from uncontrolled undermining and to provide a quicker catchment opportunity for incoming inland floods. A deepening of the lake in the area of the bridge was also intended to keep flowing water away from the foundations. The eastern basin of the overflow area was extensively raised to slow down the flow velocity of the overflowing Weser water. The weir road was reinstated in its old course and now passes directly by the Werdersee at its eastern end. Here, the new inlet flows into the lake, branching off from the left bank of the Weser above the Oberweser sailing club and ensuring the supply of fresh water and circulation to the lake over 738 meters. The slightly winding canal features artificial rapids, was constructed far from any winter dyke, is equipped with sluices at two summer dyke passages, and is designed in a very nature-friendly manner as a compensatory measure for construction work in the port area. A crucial intervention in the redesign was also the removal of the land bridge at the western end of the Werdersee, which separated it from the Kleine Weser. Since then, the dyke path has crossed over a bridge for pedestrians and cyclists, which had been requested as early as 1981, under which the two bodies of water were completely connected. They now form a continuous left-flowing watercourse from the weir road to the confluence with the Weser in the city center at the Bürgermeister-Smidt Bridge, measuring 5.7 kilometers in length. This allows potentially overflowing floodwaters from the Middle Weser to flow unhindered into the Lower Weser. Finally, in 1987, the Werdersee was flooded again, and since then it has served as one of the largest contiguous and most frequented recreational areas in the city. The floodwaters in March 1981 eroded marsh soil and sand layers, rearranged them, and created a patchwork of various soil types that offers diverse niches for plants with different requirements. As Hermann Cordes had already predicted in 1983, this provided nature conservationists with the opportunity to preserve a small area of vibrant river dynamics in the midst of the city. The lake remaining in the floodplain was ecologically redesigned. Certain shore areas were flattened, and a buffer zone was established around the reservoir to prevent excessive eutrophication from the surrounding agricultural land. Finally, on December 28, 1988, the lake and surrounding green spaces were designated as a nature reserve \"Neue Weser,\" covering 34.8 hectares. The area is left to the natural, human and livestock-unaffected vegetation development, which is scientifically monitored. It now hosts a diverse natural landscape with numerous habitats such as reeds, grasslands, tall herb communities, flood meadows, still waters, near-natural floodplain shrubs, and trees, and is designated as a European Bird Area. As such, it is of great importance for both migratory and breeding birds. For example, numerous species of ducks and gray herons live there, and river terns nest on an artificial pontoon. The water body is fed by bank filtrate from the Weser and drains through discharge pipes into the Lower Weser. In summer, there is no stable temperature stratification. As early as June 11, 1981, Chief Building Officer Winfried Reiner from the Water and Shipping Office admitted at a public meeting of the Obervieland local council that the Weser weir no longer met the then-current DIN standards. For new constructions, there must be three independently controllable flow openings according to the safety standards valid after 1981, so that in the event of damage to one weir, the majority of the floodwater can still flow through the other two. One of the most practical solutions in the context of the new regulation of flood discharge in Habenhausen was therefore a modernization or new construction – in any case, an increase in the capacity of the weir. Ultimately, a new Weser weir was built 180 meters downstream from the old site starting in 1989, with costs amounting to approximately 287.5 million, including the new lock facility. It was put into operation on June 10, 1993. The new control concept for inland floods is designed for a Weser discharge of up to 4,200 cubic meters per second – this value corresponds to the flood event in February and March 1881 and has a recurrence interval of 600 years. Of this, 3,400 m³ are to flow through the weir, and the remaining 800 m³ through the so-called \"flood discharge channel,\" which consists of the Werdersee inlet, Werdersee, and Kleine Weser."

                "content": "The critical comments following the Weser breakthrough of 1981 primarily targeted the flood control concept that existed at the time – which many commentators retrospectively deemed inadequate – as well as the behavior of political decision-makers. On March 16, Johann Dreyer, chairman of the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends, spoke out. He criticized that at the western end of the Werdersee, the Deichschartweg had been laid over a dam. Dreyer preferred a bridge with a small weir instead of just the existing narrow passage. However, the official admitted that he could only assess this technical problem as a layperson. Wilhelm Mahrtens was the head of the Water and Shipping Directorate Northwest and was responsible for the Jade-Weser area. On March 21, he attributed the \"delayed\" break of the boat harbor dike not to the water pressure from the direction of the Middle Weser, but rather to the backward erosion in the floodplain. This was made possible primarily because in the area of the undermined weir road, loose farmland had been converted into relatively solid meadows, which, according to him, should never have happened. The plowed soil had provided the water with significantly better opportunities to dig deep. Furthermore, the flood was by no means a result of the malfunction of any of the weir structures. Mahrtens considered the overflow basins between Werraweg and Bullenwerder to be a serious planning error. Without them, the first flood wave would have taken its predetermined path through the flood channel to the Werdersee. Even the former river construction director Ludwig Plate had criticized the establishment of the small garden areas in the flood-prone area, Mahrtens said. Archive documents indicate that the responsible parties had already demanded in 1928 that no parcels be built in the water drainage area. Building senator Bernd Meyer responded on March 23 with the words: \"There are now far more important things than discussing questions of guilt.\" At the extraordinary general meeting of the Hastedter Bulten small garden association on March 29, several discussion participants expressed disappointment and anger at the absence of the dike captain at the beginning of the events. The association chairman Ludwig Meyer criticized the \"human inability\" and the failure to put the defective weir structure back into operation in time. Already in January, the authorities should have ensured a regulated drainage of the Upper Weser through the Werdersee channel as a compensatory measure. \"Hanoverian merchant's stinginess\" had also prevented the Deichschartweg from being designed as a bridge. They had saved in the wrong place, as the summer dike at the Werder Bridge could only have broken and caused the violent backflow into the Weser because the water that had actually flowed further in the intended flood channel had been backed up by the reinforced Deichschart dam. Meyer summarized: \"The Werdersee has not passed its first stress test.\" Anyone who blames the small gardeners must also hold accountable those who granted building permits for Hastedter Bulten. Likely encouraged by Meyer in his opinion, Johann Dreyer brought the topic up again at a meeting of the Neustadt local council on May 6. At the public meeting of the Obervieland local council on June 11, Meyer renewed his criticism: The dike chart path dam, which additionally dammed the floodwater, and the winter dike bend at the Werder Bridge were the results of \"catastrophic planning errors.\" It was possible that a merely makeshift flood drainage had been designed out of frugality. During the meeting, members of the Fresenbulten small garden association also expressed concern about being affected by future floods. The safety of their gardens was already at risk during the next summer storm surge. Due to the commissioning of the sluice works at Lesum, Hunte, and Ochtum not even two years prior, the Weser water could rise significantly higher than before and reach the garden sheds unhindered through the (not yet closed at the time of the meeting) damage site at the Werder Bridge. However, chief building officer Winfried Reiner from the Water and Shipping Office gave them little hope for a quick remedy. The restoration of a flood-proof dike, both for Middle Weser floods and for storm surges from the opposite direction, would cost four million marks. This expenditure could only be justified if the model tests yielded corresponding results. Furthermore, Reiner countered criticism of an allegedly too-late repair of the Weser weir. They should have immediately begun repairs after the defect in November 1980, but could only work until Christmas because then winter and the high water level thwarted any further activity at the weir for safety reasons. He further expressed the suspicion that the Bulten with the small garden areas would likely have been flooded during the March flood even with a fully intact weir."

Since the 1800s, the idea of creating a new riverbed further away from the town had been continuously raised; the most dangerous section was considered to be the winding bends between the Makó timber market and Kiszombor. Surveyor József Vertics prepared a regulation plan in 1814, but it was thwarted due to the resistance of Károly Oexel, the landowner of Kiszombor: the owner did not want to hear about cuts through his lands. In 1815, royal navigation engineer Fábián Dániel Őry, sent to the site, proposed cutting through three bends of the Maros. In 1816, a committee of experts, led by royal commissioner Miklós Vay, navigated the Maros. As a result of the inspection, in November of that year, the governor's council ordered the commencement of river regulation works, but the digging of the new riverbed was interrupted due to lack of financial support. In 1820, Mihály Buday prepared a new regulation plan, but the city also did not receive financial support for its implementation. The well-known fortune teller of the Makó area, Teknyőkaparó, repeatedly predicted the impending destruction. He foretold things like: \"Soon they will see, the flood is coming quickly. It will destroy man, animal, and tree.\" \"A flood is coming upon us so great that on Száraz Street, Barna the fisherman will catch catfish.\""

In the two weeks leading up to the flood, continuous flood protection work was carried out; nevertheless, on July 2, 1821, the river flooded Apátfalva and Csanád, then broke its way towards the city near the forests of Csipkés and Szugoly. At the same time, the levee broke at Kakás; the rushing flood could only collect a small part of it from the Mikócsai and Margitai streams. Once they were full, the flood washed away the Dali and Margitai bridges, inundated Belsőnyomás and the Jángor meadow. Although the above-mentioned outskirts were submerged, on that day the inner city of Makó was still not underwater. The river continued to rise, and on the morning of July 3, it broke through the levee section at Szentlőrinc. First, it flooded the vineyards, and then within a few hours, it flooded the city itself. By 9 a.m., almost the entire city was underwater. After that, the city was surrounded by the Maros for nearly a week; the troubles of the locals, stranded far from their lands, were alleviated by aid packages and donations sent by the residents of Hódmezővásárhely and Szeged, which were delivered to Makó by boats. The damage in the city and vineyards exceeded 270,000 forints. One-third of the residential houses were damaged or collapsed; 10,600 quintals of salt dissolved in the salt barns, which exceeded the half-year salt requirement of the area belonging to the Makó salt house."

Following the spring thaw, the Danube could not recede. According to a contemporary description by city councilor József Helischer, on March 5, the lower streets of the city were already flooded with water. On March 6, despite efforts to defend against it, the icy flood broke through the dikes, and by the 8th, everything in the city center, except for the area around the Franciscan church, was submerged. The water level continued to rise until March 13, \"surpassing even that of 1809 by five feet, flooding the entire inner city.\" \"The Captain's Office promptly announced and proclaimed with drumroll that everyone should transport their movable property and livestock to a safe place, carry their fodder to the road next to the upper hemp fields, and reinforce their houses exposed to flooding. It was also communicated to millers, fishermen, and timber merchants to keep their barges, boats, and rafts ready for use in case of necessity.\" The flood lasted until March 14, that is, for nine days. Some residents left the city; they fled to higher places such as Szenttamás, Szentgyörgymező, and cellars, wine houses, or cemeteries in the surrounding mountains. The Franciscan monastery provided shelter and assistance to 760 people. However, on March 12, water also penetrated the church and the monastery, forcing everyone to leave the building, which suffered significant damage. The crypt remained underwater for days, the walls loosened, and the church, which became life-threatening, could only be restored to a condition safe for worshippers with the support of benefactors in 1857."

After the water receded, the damage was estimated at one and a half million forints. The government sent Pethőfalvi Uzovich János, the deputy governor, who began the restoration on the 16th. During the reconstruction, schools and barracks were given priority. The House of the Aged, which had been operating on the main road for 120 years, also became unusable, and the institution had to leave its old location. János Packh, who led the construction of the Basilica, prepared plans for a new hospital free of charge at the corner of Csillag Street and Hosszú Row, which opened its doors a year and a half later.

In the early months of 1838, a full ice cover covered the Danube, and at that time, a lot of precipitation fell. In early March in Vienna, the ice was already floating. The first danger occurred in Vác, where despite the dike, a flood happened. This was repeated in Pest on March 13, but only part of the city was under water. Many believed that the flood could not spread. The river built a dike with ice just after the cities of Buda and Pest, but soldiers constantly fired cannons at the dike. This maneuver was unsuccessful. On the 14th, the level reached the record set in 1775, and rescue efforts began. The residents partially took refuge in churches, which were very stable. In contrast, the houses began to collapse. 50,000 people became homeless. On the 15th, the remaining dikes could no longer protect the houses, and a catastrophic flood occurred. The most notable helper was Baron Miklós Wesselényi, who saved people sitting on rooftops by boat. (After the flood, all Hungarians added the epithet \"the flood sailor\" to Miklós Wesselényi. On that day, in some places, nearly 3 meters deep waters were measured. In Pest, 2,281 houses were destroyed, 827 houses were damaged, and 1,146 houses remained untouched. In the opposite Buda, 204 houses were destroyed, 262 houses were damaged, and 2,023 houses remained untouched. In summary, in the Kingdom of Hungary, 10,000 houses were destroyed, and 4,000 houses were damaged. In total, 153 people died, of which 151 lived in Pest. When Franz Liszt learned about the flood, he immediately traveled to Vienna and organized 8 concerts, the proceeds of which helped the homeless. After the flood, new dikes were built, and the new houses became more stable. At that time, Újpest was founded. The next flood occurred in 1876, but the dikes defended the then newly established city of Budapest (although some damage occurred in Buda and Óbuda). During the suppression of the Habsburgs, memorial plaques were placed regarding the water level at that time, but it is mentioned that the mentioned day, March 15, reminded Hungarians of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and not of the flood in 1838."

On May 19, massive forces were assembled in the city, at which point the receding flood wave reached the Hungarian-Romanian border. The Maros River peaked at 624 centimeters on May 20, 1970, at 10 PM, while a large amount of water burst forth from a spring group (spring water on the protected side of the levee) four kilometers from the city. During the critical hours, full mobilization was ordered, and the city was defended by 56 engineers, 92 technicians, 178 water management professionals, the Makó fire department, 2,600 civilians, two military units, a Soviet military unit, a technical battalion, as well as one law enforcement unit, a 120-member police unit, a civil defense unit, a workers' militia, and a Red Cross battalion."

In the event of a dam failure, the lowest parts of the city would be covered by four meters of water, while the highest point would be submerged by two meters. A total of 18,000 people were evacuated from the four municipalities and surrounding farms in a single night, most of whom – 16,000 individuals – were relocated to Hódmezővásárhely, but Szentes and several other municipalities also took in refugees. The measures, carried out with great organization and exemplary discipline, mark an important milestone in the technical history of flood defense. This was the largest evacuation in all of Europe to date. The evacuees were able to return to their homes on July 3, after the immediate danger had passed."

The banks of the Maros River were raised by an average of 1-1.5 meters, and their foundations were widened. The flood marked a turning point: upon the river's return to its bed, the then-government saw it as the right time to develop the settlement—up until then, the proximity of the Yugoslav border and the predominance of individual farming had excluded the area from development policy. The reconstruction of the main square was carried out, and several larger residential estates were created. Although delayed, industrial development also began, exclusively establishing subsidiaries of national and county factories."

There were no weather satellites, and the responsible authorities operated on a national level; international networking was only rudimentary. Particularly for smaller rivers and streams, the runoff behavior in flood situations was completely unknown. In many places, there were no gauges. Sudden weather deteriorations or a sudden rise in water levels could often only be recognized when it was already too late for timely warnings to the population. Communication means were limited to analog techniques in the form of telephones, teletypes, and radio. Notices, newspapers, air raid sirens, and loudspeaker vehicles from the police and fire department served as a link between the authorities and the population. Television and radio broadcast only limited programs for a few hours a day. Ongoing programs were often taken over by other German broadcasters and were very difficult to change or interrupt. Another problematic aspect was that even in the 1960s, the power supply in residential areas, both in rural and urban areas, was provided through overhead lines. If they were damaged by lightning or storms, it led to widespread, prolonged power outages – further reducing the possibilities for remote communication. Under such conditions, the population could only be warned by loudspeaker vehicles from the police and fire department or by officials going door to door. If power and telephone connections were interrupted and access routes were impassable, only rescue measures could be initiated."

                "content": "After an unusually wet and cold spring and summer, warm air masses from the subtropics flowed north in mid-July 1965, where they met cold Scandinavian air masses. This resulted in the formation of a so-called cold air drop on the back of the incoming warm air over northern France, which caused the very moist warm air to be completely surrounded by cold air. The warm air glided over the cold air, leading to severe thunderstorms with torrential rainfall. Already in the late evening hours of July 15, severe storms with torrential rain occurred in the Einbeck area, leading to widespread flooding. Due to the situation, the authorities responsible for disaster protection in the then district of Einbeck were forced to issue a disaster alarm at 8:45 PM, three-quarters of an hour after the storm began. In the following hours, the precipitation area, which was accompanied by severe thunderstorms, moved further west and also led to thundery precipitation in the area of the later disaster zone. In the morning hours of July 16, severe storms began in the Stadtoldendorf/Heinade/Mackensen area, which led to a worsening of the flood situation in the Ilme area. The storms moved off to the west with reinforcement and reached the Paderborn/Warburg area around noon. From 12:00 PM, almost complete darkness over the Paderborn highlands, the Warburg Börde, and the Waldecker Tafelland saw about two hours of torrential and thundery rainfall over an area limited in the west by the Rothaargebirge and in the east by the Eggegebirge and Reinhardswald, which slowly shifted eastward, weakening, until it reached the Einbeck/Göttingen area in the evening hours. During the storm, rainfall amounts of over 100 mm were recorded at weather stations in an area between Paderborn in the north, Brilon in the southwest, and Warburg and Hofgeismar in the east, as well as in the Kassel and Fritzlar area, most of which fell within a two-hour period. In the area between Paderborn and Höxter in the north, as well as Warburg and Hofgeismar in the south, there was about 200 mm of rainfall over 72 hours between July 14 and July 17, and in Dalheim, even over 200 mm in 24 hours. During this time, maximum rainfall intensities of up to 4.5 mm/minute were recorded. Further severe storms particularly worsened the situation in the following days, especially in the Kassel and Hannoversch Münden areas."

                "content": "In the catchment area of the Diemel and the Twiste as well as the Lippe and Altenau, the rainfall could no longer be absorbed by the already saturated soils; likewise, the underground cave systems typical of karst landscapes were already so filled beforehand that a catastrophic runoff event occurred. Due to the surface runoff and the erupting karst springs in the area of the Paderborn high plateau, as well as in the area of Stadtoldendorf and Heinade in the Holzminden district, previously unobserved water levels were reached in the rivers and streams within a very short time. The erupting karst springs on the slopes of the typical box valleys of karst landscapes and the high intensity of the rainfall led to large amounts of water not only flooding into the villages from the rivers but also flowing down directly from the mountain slopes as flash floods. In unfavorable slope areas, numerous mudslides occurred. Retaining structures such as road embankments, too small bridges and culverts, as well as field walls and even pasture fences that held back the debris led to temporarily even higher water levels. Due to the extreme rainfall on water-saturated soil, there was a rapid rise in water levels in streams and rivers in the rainfall area. Depending on the size of the catchment area, the possibility of overflow, and the capacity of the riverbed, maximum water levels were reached shortly after the midday storms subsided. At the Schmittwasser, a flow of 15.4 m³/s was recorded on July 16 at 1:57 PM, and at the Ellerbach, a flow of 20.6 m³/s was recorded at 2:38 PM. In Paderborn, on July 16, the flow at the Pader gauge was 47.3 m³/s, which is almost ten times the average flow. At the Pader spring, it took until the end of August for the values to normalize. This extreme flow led to widespread flooding in the urban area. The Altenau brought a flood wave to the Lippe, which caused flooding up to the mouth of the Lippe. The flow at the Lippe gauges was ten times the five-year average. The gauge of the Diemel at its mouth in Bad Karlshafen rose by 5 meters within a few hours in the morning of July 17. In Eberschütz, which was hit by the flood peak during the night from July 16 to 17, the Diemel swelled so quickly that the town was flooded within half an hour. At the gauge on the upper reaches of the Diemel in Westheim near Marsberg, the flow on July 16 was 225 cubic meters per second (average 1954/2006: 5.26 m³/s). In Helmarshausen near Bad Karlshafen on the lower reaches of the Diemel, the flow even reached 820 cubic meters per second, while the normal flow here is about 10.4 m³/s. The flood wave of the Diemel led to a water level in the Weser at Bad Karlshafen that exceeded the summer flood of 1956. However, the flood peak of the Weser flattened significantly along its course to the Weser dam in Bremen-Hastedt and was no longer noticeable at the tide gauges of the Weser below Bremen, unlike the July flood of 1956. At the gauges of Fulda and Eder, the situation remained relaxed despite the extreme rainfall, as the water level of the Edersee had already been lowered several days earlier. Thus, the partially drained reservoir could absorb and store 29 million cubic meters of water that flowed in from the heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the upper reaches of the Eder."

                "content": "The starting point for many very severe damages were numerous damming structures. These included the small dams built at the many water mills at that time, as well as outdated road bridges and culverts that were not designed for such loads and were heavily damaged or destroyed. In the settlements, the river cross-sections were greatly constricted by installations and were therefore unable to accommodate the water masses coming from the upper reaches. The large debris carried along proved to be very dangerous, blocking culverts and bridges. The stone arch or vaulted bridges that were common in the region at that time were particularly vulnerable, with 40 of them in the catchment area of Alme, Altenau, and Lippe being destroyed or so severely damaged that they had to be replaced by new constructions. The flood waves, some of which were meters high, resulting from dam breaks destroyed or severely damaged numerous massive bridges, thereby interrupting regional road connections as well as power and telephone lines. Field walls built across the valley cross-section or near the banks also proved to be a cause of high flood waves, as they could not withstand the high water pressure over time. The collapse of the medieval monastery wall in Dalheim, the break of a road dam at Wrexen, the break of the medieval city wall at the Esse culvert in Grebenstein, and the collapse of a wall that dammed the floodwater in Etteln led to meter-high flood waves that occurred completely unexpectedly for the population and rushed down the valley. Severe damage occurred on agricultural land where grassland in floodplain locations had been converted into arable land, as well as in areas where river straightening had taken place as part of land improvement measures. There, not only were there severe damages to the banks, but also, as at the Dalbach below Oesdorf near Westheim, the river course was reverted to the old riverbed. Banks consisting only of individual trees were also severely damaged. There were significant bank collapses, severe scouring, and deepening of the riverbeds of rivers and streams. In the district of Paderborn alone, 24 road bridges were destroyed. Above damming road dams, there were large deposits of silt and gravel. Over-siltation also led to severe damage on agricultural land, which was deposited there by the layer floods and debris flows rushing down from the slopes of the valley. These floods had a similar character, depending on the slope inclination, to what is observed in alpine torrents. The German geologist Ecke von Zezschwitz, who was in the disaster area during the storm, witnessed a layer flood about 1.5 km long and several hundred meters wide at Elisenhof. On the slopes of the valley, there were many large landslides, and in unfavorable locations, entire old forest stands slid down, for example, in the forest areas near Blankenrode. In some areas, due to the special geological structure of the karst as well as the slope and soil conditions, badlands were formed. In the Minstal located about 1.5 km southeast of Etteln between Donnerberg and Ettlerberg, a 1.5 km long and up to 5 m deep erosion channel was washed out, reaching into the rock. Not only loose material but also large rock material was washed out of this channel. A cloudburst is assumed to be the cause, during which a rainfall amount of over 150 mm fell in a very short time."

A significant damage hotspot was located in Wrexen. After 156 mm of rainfall fell in Rhoden in a very short time and immediately flowed into the Rhodener Bach, which drains into the Diemel, the water masses accumulated in front of the bridge located in the road embankment of the federal highway 252, which was not designed for such a flood, rising so high that the embankment was flooded. The excessively steep outer slope gave way under the now overflowing water masses, and the dam broke over a length of 80 meters. As a result of the dam break, the previously accumulated water masses suddenly poured into the areas below the dam. On their way down, three water mills and their associated buildings were caught by a four-meter-high tidal wave and severely damaged or destroyed. On the way to the Diemel, the massive road bridge along Ramser Straße in Wrexen was completely washed away. Numerous houses and businesses were severely damaged, and building debris and agricultural equipment were transported over long distances. In Wrexen, a woman lost her life during the storm. She was in a house that was hit by a mudslide. The bridge over the Diemel along federal highway 7 near Warburg was destroyed by the flood. This interrupted an important regional road connection between Kassel and Paderborn at the time. At the Immenhausen train station on the Kassel–Warburg railway line, hundreds of passengers of the Deutsche Bundesbahn were stranded, as the line was no longer passable due to the flooding of the station in Grebenstein. In Grebenstein, the Esse, a tributary of the Diemel, carried logs from a sawmill upstream to the city wall. The river, initially dammed by the floating debris made of long wood, then caused part of the city wall to collapse at the entrance of the Esse at the Hilte, after which the water suddenly poured into the city center in the form of a meter-high tidal wave, causing severe damage along with the carried logs. In Helmarshausen, over 100 people were trapped by the rapidly rising water of the Diemel. They could only be rescued with the help of helicopters. There was one fatality during the rescue. There were also severe damages from flooding in Trendelburg and Bad Karlshafen. The entire historic old town of Bad Karlshafen was flooded several meters high. The water level of the flood exceeded that of 1956 on the Weser. Debris and animal carcasses were transported as far as Hameln."

In Etteln, 200 people were trapped by rapidly rising floodwaters, and 7 residents were killed, including 4 children, after a field wall that had initially kept the water of the Altenau away from the town gave way under the pressure of the water masses. After the wall broke, a two-meter-high tidal wave suddenly poured into the village. Four people, including three children, were swept away from a residential house and drowned. Many of the residents of Etteln, who were in life-threatening situations, could only be rescued from their homes by helicopters or heavy military equipment. In Schloss Neuhaus, two people lost their lives in the flood. Here, the bridge over the Alme was destroyed as part of the federal highway 64 after it became blocked with debris. The flood wave of the Alme, as well as the rainfall that could no longer be managed by the rainwater drainage system, flooded parts of downtown Paderborn, where some streets were flooded up to one meter high. Severe damage occurred in the flooded houses in the city center and in shops and businesses. Severe flooding also occurred in Schwaney, where the entire town center was flooded, and in Lipperode. In Lippstadt, the city center was flooded up to one meter high. Numerous important buildings, including both hospitals, were also no longer accessible to emergency services. Flooding also occurred further along the Lippe in the areas of Hamm, Haltern am See, and Dorsten; however, no residential areas were affected, as the Lippe dikes controlled by the responsible authorities held against the floodwaters."

                "content": "Due to the catastrophic rainfall in the midday and early afternoon hours and the rapidly swelling rivers and streams, the responsible authorities declared a disaster alarm. This led to the deployment of thousands of civilian and military helpers. In addition to the local fire departments, the Red Cross, church aid services, the police, and the Technical Relief Agency, soldiers from the Bundeswehr as well as the British Rhine Army stationed in Detmold, Hameln, and Senne were involved. While in Lower Saxony the disaster plans established after the weather disasters of August 1955 and June 1961 in the Leine area, as well as the July flood of 1956 on the Leine, Aller, and Weser rivers, were implemented and more severe impacts were prevented by a centrally coordinated deployment of rescue forces, the disaster response in the affected North Rhine-Westphalian regions proved to be inadequate. During the cleanup operations, the then North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Minister Willi Weyer had to admit serious deficiencies in disaster protection. Due to a lack of coordination among the rescue forces, there were initially significant problems with the rescue measures. Military units from the Bundeswehr as well as Belgian, Dutch, and British military units stationed in the region set out on their own after the responsible local commanders recognized the existence of a catastrophic emergency. Other rescue units such as the fire department, THW, and Red Cross were unaware of these operations. The complete collapse of the telecommunications network and the absence of radios had particularly devastating effects. The responsible authorities of the districts had to send messengers in some areas to warn the municipal administrations in the affected areas. These reached the affected areas only after hours in some cases. In the particularly hard-hit municipality of Etteln, the Technical Operations Center set up by the municipal administration had only a single radio. Significant problems were caused by the numerous destroyed bridges and the local, regional, and interregional roads that were impassable even for high-wheeled emergency vehicles. This meant that in some cases, long detours were necessary to reach the sites of operations. The inadequate equipment of the rescue teams prevented the rescue of those trapped in many places. At the Kuhlemühle Küting near Ossendorf, the Bundeswehr's attempt to rescue eight people and several children with a helicopter not designed for this situation failed. In Etteln, a woman and a child fell from the makeshift rescue rope attached to the helicopter. Some people sat on the roofs of their houses in the flood area for 17 hours. A woman also lost her life during a failed rescue operation by a helicopter at the Diemel. Below the Wrexer Pond between Wrexen and Rhoden, where a catastrophic flood wave occurred after the break of a road dam, a dramatic rescue operation took place. The people trapped in the mill building threatened with collapse, including two children, could not be rescued from the air because the helicopters in operation were only equipped with ropes that were too short, making it impossible to reach those trapped. Louiza Ramus, a citizen of Wrexen, who, along with sport diver Horst Richard Platt, rescued the trapped individuals from the building, was honored for her selfless act in December 1965 by the then Hessian Prime Minister Georg August Zinn with the Rescue Medal of the State of Hesse."

Noteworthy are the investigations by geologist and then director of the Geological State Office of North Rhine-Westphalia in Krefeld, Herbert Karrenberg, \"Precipitation Intensity and Erosion in the Karst Area of Paderborn during the Storm of July 16, 1965,\" the work of geologist Ecke von Zezschwitz \"Soil and Vegetation Influences on Flooding and Erosion during the Storm of July 16, 1965 in the Area of the Paderborn Plateau\" (1967), as well as the report \"Flood-Related Landscape Damage in the Catchment Area of the Altenau and its Tributaries\" by Walter Mrass, with contributions from Wilhelm Lohmeyer and Gerhard Olschowy, prepared by the then Federal Institute for Vegetation Science, Nature Conservation, and Landscape Management on behalf of the Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe. Of particular importance is the work of Ecke von Zezschwitz, as he experienced the storm firsthand and made detailed observations as an experienced geologist, which could be incorporated into both his work and that of Herbert Karrenberg. In the investigation by Mrass, Lohmeyer, and Olschowy, the focus was primarily on the damage that occurred outside of settlement areas. They found that river sections whose banks were lined with a closed tree stand, preferably consisting of ashes and willows, withstood this extreme flood without significant damage. This applied to both flat banks and erosion-prone undercut banks. The ash tree proved to be optimal, as its dense root system stabilized the bank so that the water masses could not wash away the loose material at the bank. In certain areas, Mrass, Lohmeyer, and Olschowy also found that stands of perennials, especially nettles, were extremely effective in protecting the banks during the Heinrich flood. The nettles anchored the bank substrate with their extensive root system, and the plants lay down on the bank bottom with the strong current, thus preventing erosion. In sections with sparse tree cover along the banks and those without any tree cover, the heaviest damage occurred according to Mrass, Lohmeyer, and Olschowy. This was particularly true for river sections where grassland use extended right up to the bank. A destroyed grass sward due to livestock trampling in the area of watering places greatly favored bank destruction. Similarly, fencing had a very negative impact. Dam structures, especially bridges and culverts with insufficient flow capacity, promoted bank collapses and the formation of deep pools below the structures. River sections consisting of single trees or small groups of trees also suffered severe damage. Unlike a closed tree cover along the bank, here the vortices intensified the effect of the strongly turbulent floodwaters. There was a very strong formation of pools, and the trees standing on the bank were uprooted, subsequently creating obstacles in front of culverts and bridges as driftwood. This driftwood not only worsened the situation in front of dam structures, such as bridges and culverts, but also caused pasture fences to develop a damming effect on the floodwaters due to the accumulating driftwood."

                "content": "Following the July flood of 1965, flood protection and the system of water associations in the affected areas were restructured. To prevent similar events, significant interventions were made in river management. This included the straightening, deepening, and channeling of riverbeds, widening of bridge cross-sections, and the creation of large retention basins, such as in the catchment area of the Alme near Husen-Dalheim and at its tributary, the Sauer near Sudheim and Ebbinghausen. The Aabach dam near Bad Wünnenberg, which had been planned before World War II, was also tailored to flood protection needs, creating additional storage options in the event of flooding in the Aabach catchment area. In the jurisdiction of the water association Obere Lippe, founded in 1971, 23 flood retention basins were built. There were also significant interventions in the Diemel catchment area in the form of river straightening and the construction of dikes. At the Twiste, the previously planned but repeatedly discarded Twistesee was constructed in the first half of the 20th century to improve flood protection. In Lower Saxony, measures had already been initiated following the storm disaster of August 1955, the flooding of the Weser, Aller, and Leine in July 1956, and the June flood in southern Hanover, as well as the flood disaster of 1962 on the North Sea coast. These included, among other things, an improvement in disaster protection, a fundamental reform of the partially centuries-old water association law, and above all, the establishment of the Aller-Leine-Oker plan. By the time of the Heinrich flood, the planning processes for the construction of flood protection structures in Lower Saxony were already in full swing."

The peak of the catastrophic intensification of a flood situation occurred in the catchment areas of the Weser from February 2 to 11, 1946. After a winter frost period, a thaw began on January 28, 1946. Neither the frost-induced impermeability of the soils in January 1946 nor the snowmelt in the Harz that began at the end of January 1946 played as significant a role in the catastrophic extent of the February flood as in previous extreme floods in the Hanover area. The unusual heavy rainfall in early February 1946 was responsible for the disaster. As a result, on February 10, 1946, the largest flood disaster in the city of Hanover occurred. The rivers Leine and Ihme, as well as the Maschsee, overflowed their banks. This was exacerbated by the natural narrowing of the 900-meter-wide flow area of the Ihme at Waterlooplatz to 400 meters at the Glocksee Bridge. Additionally, around 700,000 gasoline canisters were washed ashore from a British depot at the Schützenplatz Hanover, further blocking the water flow under the bridges. Consequently, 1,666 hectares were flooded to a height of 3 meters, including the districts of Altstadt, Calenberger Neustadt, Südstadt, Linden, and Ricklingen. The water level of the Leine in Herrenhausen rose to 6.44 meters, a level that has not been reached since. This water level is considered a once-in-a-century flood for the city of Hanover. The flood claimed three lives and caused significant property damage. After the flood, there was uncontrolled removal of historical documents in the Hanover city archive, which were burned for heating in the winter, resulting in the loss of 80% of the city's 19th-century historical records."

On the night of July 8 to 9, 1927, after several days of rainfall during a Vb weather situation, a thunderstorm front passed through, which caused 113 millimeters of precipitation in the source area of Gottleuba and Müglitz, in the Ore Mountain ridge around Sattelberg, Mückentürmchen, and Geisingberg, within 25 minutes. In Dohna, the flow of the Müglitz reached a value of 330 m³/s, while in the town of Gottleuba, the flow of the Gottleuba even reached 400 m³/s. For comparison: the Elbe reaches an average flow (MQ, referring to the years 1980–2008) of 305 m³/s at the gauge in Schöna. The water masses surprised the residents of the valley settlements during the night hours. There was almost no warning time, resulting in a total of about 160 fatalities, 88 of which were in Berggießhübel alone. Thus, the flood in the Ore Mountains in 1927 is considered one of the most devastating flood disasters in recent German history."

Since 1560, heavy rainfall with devastating flash floods that caused significant damage and claimed numerous lives has been repeatedly documented. In the Müglitztal alone, eighteen severe flood disasters occurred between 1609 and 2002. According to records, nearly 60 severe floods have occurred in the valleys of Gottleuba and Müglitz in the last 500 years. Among these, the floods of more recent times, namely in the years 1897, 1927, 1957, and 2002, caused particularly devastating destruction. Among these more recent floods, the event of July 8/9, 1927 stands out in a particularly tragic way due to the estimated 160 fatalities."

Initially multi-day rainfalls have repeatedly developed into torrential downpours in the past, with precipitation totals in the higher elevations reaching extreme values, sometimes close to the limits of what is physically possible. The flood of 1927 was attributed to a Vb weather situation (as were the floods of 1897, 1957, and 2002). In this case, low-pressure areas brought extremely moist and warm air with high precipitation potential along the path from the Mediterranean region to the Polish Baltic coast, which caused strong and prolonged land rain (area-wide precipitation). Since Saxony was caught on the western flank of this low, the air masses were pushed from the north against the Ore Mountains. The blocking effect led to the precipitation of the saturated air masses on the northern side. At the same time, the decreasing movement speed caused a longer stationary stay over the mountains. This resulted in the complete precipitation of convective rainfall with torrential showers and thunderstorms."

While the source areas of the Müglitz and Gottleuba are located at an altitude of about 700 to 800 meters, the mouths reached after 34 and 49 kilometers of flow length are at an altitude of about 110 meters. Thus, the rivers exhibit a steep gradient with significant height differences in a very small area. As a result, the river valleys have cut steeply and narrowly into the underlying rocks. Natural retention areas, such as larger valley widenings, are hardly present or have been utilized since the mid-19th century for settlement and transportation development. The high gradient and insufficient retention areas lead to high flow velocities of the waters, especially during floods."

                "header": "Forest poverty",
                "content": "The river basins of Gottleuba and Müglitz belonged to the dense forest area before their settlement, which extended from the edge of the Elbe valley widening to the ridge areas and the Bohemian southern slope of the Ore Mountains. At the time of the flood in 1927, however, the source areas of both rivers could be described as low in forest cover. Even today, only about 45% (202 square kilometers) of the approximately 460 square kilometer catchment areas of Müglitz and Gottleuba are forested. The comparatively low forest proportion for a medium mountain range is, among other things, a consequence of the settlement that began in the 12th century. With the land acquisition, the forest landscape in the Eastern Ore Mountains transformed within a few decades into a cultural landscape characterized by villages, towns, fields, and transport routes. This settlement activity led to extensive deforestation, as the consumption of firewood alone in the 16th century was estimated at a minimum of 20 cubic meters per household per year. Additionally, there was consumption for the construction of houses (half-timbering, shingles, etc.) and the production of everyday goods (home furnishings). Even after fires, larger amounts of wood were needed for reconstruction. The total wood consumption of a settler amounted to over 500 kilograms per year by the mid-16th century. The settlement-related demand on the forest was further intensified by iron ore mining in the region around Berggießhübel and Bad Gottleuba and tin mining from Altenberg and Zinnwald. Both mining itself and the smelting industry were existentially dependent on wood as a building material and on charcoal as an energy source. The production of just one kilogram of iron required the use of 29 to 46 kilograms of wood. The required amounts of wood were largely harvested without regard to the regeneration capacity of the forests, leading to their depletion and devastation. The iron ore mining or the iron ore smelting in the central Gottleuba area consumed one to two square kilometers of forest per year during its peak (16th century). The fact is that forests can mitigate the effects of floods. They have an intense and extensive root system that is highly water-conductive and water-retaining. While about 65 to 70 liters of water per square meter can seep into a flat forest floor, only 20 liters can do so on an equally sized pasture. Another part of the precipitation can be retained by the crown canopy and evaporates from there again. In the coniferous forests that prevail in the Eastern Ore Mountains, about 30 to 40% of the precipitation does not reach the ground at all, as it is converted into water vapor by the trees and released back into the atmosphere."

                "content": "The flood was caused by a thunderstorm front that moved in from the southwest, from Bohemia (the region around Děčín) over the Ore Mountains ridge. At Mückenberg (Komáří hůrka) and Sattelberg (Špičák u Krásného Lesa), it split and rained down in the Müglitz and Gottleuba valleys. Part of this thunderstorm was stopped by the Schneeberg (Děčínský Sněžník) and later poured into the source areas of the Müglitz and Gottleuba. Between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM, the thunderstorm settled in the Sattelberg area after having hit the town of Schönwald. The Gottleuba, which normally has a width of three meters, widened to 80 to 100 meters. Flood waves formed that crashed into the valleys up to six meters high. The amount of water that fell was estimated at 120 to 150 liters per square meter. In Schönwald (Krásný Les), 209 millimeters of precipitation fell. No further precise data is known, as several measuring stations of the national weather service fell victim to the storm."

Additionally, many people were caught off guard by the second flood wave that broke in around midnight while they were asleep. A particular tragedy arose from the partial annihilation of entire families. However, the exact number of people who lost their lives in the devastating storm cannot be precisely determined to this day, as the number of guests, day-trippers, and workers (who were involved in laying a telephone line towards Vienna, among other things) present on site remains uncertain. Therefore, the literature varies the number of victims between 146 and 158 dead. It seems realistic to assume about 160 victims. The numbers provided below include all flood victims who died in the municipalities, i.e., both residents and guests (spa guests, workers, etc.)."

The evening train standing in Glashütte was swept away by the second flood wave for over 300 meters. In total, the flood destroyed about 20 kilometers of track, while the remaining sections were largely rendered impassable due to scouring, siltation, and the deposition of debris. Of the 28 railway bridges located between Köttewitz and Lauenstein, 24 collapsed. This caused one of the main transport routes in the Eastern Ore Mountains to be out of service for an extended period. For passenger transport, a replacement bus service was established via Dippoldiswalde. Freight transport was also shifted to the road (as far as possible and necessary given the destroyed business locations). The reconstruction of the line resembled a new construction due to the financial and material effort involved. The first section between Heidenau and Köttewitz was able to be put back into operation on July 26, with the remaining sections following gradually: August 15: Lauenstein–Altenberg, August 18: Köttewitz–Weesenstein, October 3: Weesenstein–Häselich, October 13: Häselich–Oberschlottwitz, November 15: Oberschlottwitz–Glashütte. It was not until December 1 that the line was fully operational again. The recommissioning of the \"lifeline\" of the valley was celebrated enthusiastically in the neighboring communities. At the same time, the severe destruction and the extensive reconstruction measures sparked considerations for converting the narrow-gauge line to standard gauge. The goal of these considerations was to raise the track by up to 15 meters to reduce future flood damage."

The Müglitz, carrying large amounts of debris and driftwood, swelled to 100 meters wide and two meters high in the lower part of the town around the train station. Individual flood waves are said to have reached heights of up to six meters. The evening train of the Müglitztalbahn, which was standing at the station, was completely surrounded by the floodwaters, with some cars being swept away up to 300 meters. Two of the swept-away cars smashed into the Kurfürst-Moritz Bridge over the Müglitz, which had been built in 1545 and had withstood the severe flood of July 31, 1897. The passengers trapped in the cars were rescued by the fire department around 2:30 AM. After the flood receded, the train station area was covered about one meter high with mud, debris, and sludge.

The affected area extended from Mühlhausen, Langensalza, and Artern in the north to Stadtilm and Ichtershausen in the south, from Erfurt and Gotha in the west to Naumburg in the east. The weather disaster is described as the \"Thuringian deluge\" in the chronicles of many localities: In Kahla, there were several fatalities, and in Jena, large parts of the city were flooded. In Zottelstedt near Apolda, the water level of the Ilm rose by 6 to 8 meters, almost completely destroying the village along the riverbank. In Apolda itself, eight houses were washed away, and 24 animals drowned. In Weimar, 44 houses were destroyed in the flood disaster, in Bad Berka 23 houses, and in Erfurt 125 houses. In Mattstedt, the water level of the Ilm rose by 6 meters, flooding the entire lower village. The disaster resulted in the further development of the area shifting to higher ground. In Bad Sulza, the saline built a few years earlier on the Ilm fell victim to the flood but was rebuilt at the same location. The total number of fatalities is reported to be 2,261 people. Historical flood events like the Thuringian deluge also play an important role in current research on this topic as hydrological-meteorological extreme situations. See also: century flood."

Between July 14 and July 16, 1956, there was nearly 50 hours of heavy rain in the mountainous regions of Lower Saxony, Thuringia, Hesse, and East Westphalia, as well as severe thunderstorms in the lowlands. These rains fell on water-saturated ground, causing the precipitation to only flow off the surface. In a very short time, water levels rose dramatically, leading to widespread flooding. By July 16, 1956, the water level of the Weser River in Minden rose to 4.50 meters above the average water level; shipping on the Upper and Middle Weser came to a standstill. In the city area of Braunschweig, 681 hectares of green and arable land were flooded in the Wabe and Mittelriede areas by July 17. In the lignite mine of Retterode near Hessisch Lichtenau (Werra-Meißner-Kreis), massive water ingress occurred on July 15 due to the rainfall, leading to partial flooding of the underground facilities. The situation worsened along the Aller and Leine rivers and in the Hessian highlands after further severe rain on July 18 and 19, 1956, resulting in dike breaches, riverbed relocations, and uncontrolled overflow of the Eder dam. The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen narrowly avoided a severe flood disaster solely because the floodwaters were diverted through the overflow routes that still existed at the time near Thedinghausen into the Ochtum lowlands, which, however, flooded the municipalities of Stuhr and Hasbergen. Due to the flooding on the Middle Weser, over 240,000 hectares were flooded by July 25. The estimated damage amounted to over 170 million DM. The Porta Westfalica gauge of the state water authority showed an extreme value of 1180 m³/s and 629 cm on July 17, 1956, which was nearly as high as the century flood of the Weser at 2300 m³/s and 790 cm on February 10, 1946."

On the evening of March 21, ice floes formed a barrier due to ice movement near the bypass canal at Küstrin-Kietz. Ice displacements also formed north of Reitwein. This quickly dammed large amounts of water. On the morning of March 22, 1947, at 1 a.m., the Oder dike at Reitwein was finally flooded. The dike crown was overtopped by water at two points over a length of more than 100 meters. Quickly, areas of the dike crown were destroyed over a width of about 300 meters and a depth of one meter. The flood even reached Bad Freienwalde (Oder), several kilometers from the river, where the main post office building in the city center is located, where a memorial stone can be found today. More than 20,000 people became homeless at that time. The head of the disaster protection department of the Märkisch-Oderland district administration also confirmed a ultimately unsuccessful deployment of Red Army bombers against the dangerous ice displacements on the Oder in 1947. On the morning of March 22, Soviet aircraft dropped eight bombs, and in the afternoon, four more bombs were dropped. Further bombings were also carried out on March 23. However, all measures did not yield the hoped-for results. It was not until March 24 that the displacement dissolved around 9 p.m."

The airport in Koh Samui was also temporarily closed, leaving thousands of tourists stranded. It is estimated that about 265 thousand people were affected by the floods.

In addition, gas and ash clouds were released. The extensive amounts of sulfur dioxide emitted reacted with the water droplets in the clouds to form sulfurous acid and sulfuric acid. Alongside an estimated 122 million tons of sulfur dioxide, 15 million tons of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and 7 million tons of hydrogen chloride (HCl) were released. This had devastating consequences for the entire country: due to poisoning, livestock suffered (→ fluorosis); and the resulting famine caused an estimated 9,350 people to die in the following years, more than one-fifth of the population of Iceland. The eruption also affected Western Europe, as the toxic aerosol cloud spread over the entire continent, particularly over the British Isles, and was perceived as high smoke or \"dry fog.\" Records report that the smog lingered in the sky for weeks. Symptoms of poisoning manifested as shortness of breath, making it difficult for farmers to carry out their fieldwork. Alone on the British Isles, around 25,000 people died. The eruption of Mount Asama in Japan in 1783 had a relatively minor impact on climate changes compared to the eruption of the Laki craters."

The frost period lasted a total of 13 weeks in Mainfranken. The cold began in December 1783, and almost all bodies of water in Central Europe froze over. The Great Belt in Denmark was frozen so solidly that it could be crossed with sleds and carts. Around December 26/27, 1783, there was a brief improvement in temperatures, but by the end of the year, they dropped sharply again. This extreme cold lasted until mid-January 1784. From mid-January to February 21/22, this cold phase was repeatedly interrupted by short periods of slightly milder temperatures. During this time, it also snowed frequently. The winter was very snowy from December to February. From December 24, 1783, to February 21, for example, 29 snowfall events were observed in Mannheim, some lasting for days. In some regions, the snow accumulated to more than 150 centimeters, with around 45 centimeters falling in the Rhine-Neckar area on December 27 and 28, 1783. February also brought a lot of snow and ice. All of Europe was affected by a cold wave from late December 1783 into January, stretching from the Black Sea to the Atlantic. In France, it was so cold that wolves appeared in the villages to prey on livestock. The snow amounts in the winter of 1783/84 severely restricted agricultural production in various German states, leading to significant supply shortages. To bridge these shortages, the respective governments intervened with controls. In Königsberg, so much grain was stored that there was not enough space for it. Several people froze to death in Darmstadt. Ice floes formed on the Saxon Elbe, becoming denser, and on the night of December 28 to 29, the river froze before the Augustus Bridge in Dresden. In Frankfurt am Main, bread and wood collections were conducted in January 1784 due to the ongoing severe cold and to support the poor. A total of 14,752 loaves of six pounds each were distributed. In Speyer, a modest celebration was held on the frozen Rhine to counteract poverty with the proceeds from this charity event. Out of fear of possible ice movement, public prayers were ordered in Cologne and Bamberg. In Stuttgart, a balloon was released in the courtyard of the military academy, illuminated and accompanied by a small fireworks display. The proceeds from this event were used to buy wood for the city's poor, as prices were very high. On January 7, temperatures of minus 17.5 degrees Réaumur (−21.9 °C) were recorded in Leipzig at seven in the morning. In Weida in the Vogtland, the Réaumur thermometer also showed minus 21 degrees Réaumur (−26.3 °C) on January 7 in the morning. However, even in the cold January of 1784, warmer periods were recorded in Saxony. From January 15 to 17, there was a thaw, with a maximum temperature of +5 °C reached. This meteorological pattern, alternating between colder and warmer periods, continued in February 1784 and led to a buildup of ice on the Elbe, as the cold January period in Germany was followed by a cold section that was repeatedly interrupted by short warmer phases until February 21/22. The severe frost lasted until the end of February 1784, causing ice masses on the Elbe to pile up to 110 centimeters. Additionally, significant snowfall in the Electorate made the supply situation more difficult."

The change in the large-scale weather situation brought warm air masses from western and southern directions to Mainfranken as well as to large parts of Europe. The winter had previously been characterized by above-average long periods of high pressure over Central Europe and the East, with very cold air masses being brought in from northern and eastern directions. The warm air influx was marked by widespread uplift movements leading to heavy precipitation. Due to the rapid and intense warming, accompanied by heavy rainfall, the last days of February 1784 saw the breaking and accumulation of ice in Germany's rivers. Because of the enormous amounts of meltwater, the ice jams, and the heavy precipitation, water levels began to rise very quickly. Ice movement occurred simultaneously on all major main and tributary rivers. Complicating matters was the fact that several ice layers had been pushed on top of each other during temporary thaw phases, which then refroze. Shortly after this warm air influx, cold weather returned due to another change in the large-scale weather situation, precipitation decreased, and water levels fell rapidly. The blocking high had dissolved, and the previous weather patterns could re-establish themselves. Cold air from northern and eastern directions flowed back into Central Europe."

                "content": "The flood event is considered one of the largest natural disasters of the early modern period in Central Europe. The flood devastated entire valleys, and countless bridges were destroyed. It is also referred to as the \"century ice flow\" or \"ice flood\" or \"winter flood of 1784.\" Cologne was struck by the worst flood ever recorded. During the mentioned temperature rise, the Rhine was completely frozen, while the melting snow and breaking ice caused a record level of 13.55 meters – for comparison, the normal level is 3.48 meters. The floods, on which heavy ice floes floated, devastated large parts of the riverbank construction and destroyed all ships. Individual buildings, including fortifications, collapsed due to the ice floes. There were 65 fatalities. In Beuel, only a few buildings with stone foundations survived the ice blocks; all half-timbered houses were washed away. The old Bergisch town of Mülheim on the right bank of the Rhine, now a district of Cologne, was completely destroyed. The trees of the famous walnut forest on the Namedyer Werth (since 1857 a peninsula) near Andernach were literally cut off by the ice floes above their roots. The Andernach Old Krahnen escaped the disaster due to the basalt icebreaker built upstream on the Rhine. At the Moselle, the ice flood of 1784 is the highest winter flood documented by flood marks to this day. In Trier, the highest water level was observed on February 28, 1784. The water reached there up to the horse market and into Jakobsgasse. A plaque on a building at the Great Market in Saarlouis marks the water level of the Saar from 1784. The Neckar caused the largest flood in historical times in Heidelberg. The consequences of the flood were exacerbated by the ice flow. In addition to the Old Bridge, 39 buildings were destroyed and 290 were damaged. Other communities, especially Neckarhausen, were similarly affected along the Neckar's route towards the mouth, including Mannheim's city center. After Seckenheim, the river partially took the path of an old mouth arm and flooded the Neckarau several kilometers away. The natural disaster prompted the establishment of the first flood protection measures between Edingen and Mannheim. Among other things, under the reign of Elector Karl Friedrich of Baden, an icebreaker made of sandstone was installed on the banks of the Neckar in Edingen. The Main also experienced extreme flooding. This second highest flood after 1342 (Magdalene flood) is classified as a 300- to 500-year event in the middle Main area. The flood mark at the town hall portal of Würzburg shows a maximum level of 173.83 m above sea level for this flood, which is 94 cm above the value from 1845. Compared to the flood recorded at the gauge in 1845, the flood of 1784 had a water level of 928 centimeters, with a discharge of 2600 m³/s. In Bamberg, the largest flood of all time claimed the riverbank construction in the mill district. The bridges were also heavily damaged. In particular, the Sees Bridge, completed in 1756, now known as the Chain Bridge, with its baroque design, was destroyed by ice floes and uprooted tree trunks. In Marktbreit, the half-timbered loading crane of the time was destroyed and later replaced by a stone structure with an icebreaker. At the end of February / beginning of March 1784, one of the most severe spring floods ever recorded occurred in the Bohemian and Saxon Elbe valley. The Elbe, which had been frozen for weeks, broke up in a very short time, rising by up to 32 cm per hour and reaching a level of 8.57 m in Dresden on March 1 (discharge 5200 m³/s). This was the highest level since 1655. In the entire Elbe valley, cities and villages were extensively flooded. In Dresden, the water stood one meter high in the courtyard of the Zwinger. The destructive power of the flood was particularly great due to the force of the debris and ice floes carried along. In Wegstädtl in Bohemia, the Gothic church collapsed. The Elbe bridges in Dresden and Meissen were heavily damaged. While in numerous places livestock could not be saved, the number of fatalities was relatively low given the severity of the flood. In Meissen, nine people lost their lives in the floodwaters. The old postal road between Meissen and Dresden was relocated to flood-safe areas due to the flood. Although the Elbe had already returned to its original course by March 6, the cleanup efforts were difficult as the onset of frost covered the flooded houses and areas with a layer of ice. The water levels at that time were only surpassed in many places during the Elbe flood of 1845. Further downstream in the Duchy of Magdeburg between Aken and Sandau, extreme floods with dike breaches occurred only in early April, including between Cracau and Prester near Magdeburg. The area around the mouth of the Saale into the Elbe at Calbe (Saale) and the section north of the city of Jerichow to Sandau were also heavily affected, all areas that were particularly impacted by the flood of 2013. After the Lahn in Weilburg destroyed a bridge with a water pipeline, the first chain bridge on the European continent was built here after reconstruction. Smaller rivers like the Glan in Ulmet (Pfalz) or the Paar in Baar-Ebenhausen (Bavaria) also experienced flooding."

The first phase, which occurred on November 4th, was marked by heavy thunderstorm-like precipitation and primarily affected the southernmost sectors of Piedmont and the Ligurian territory: the maximum intensity of rain was reached during the night between November 4th and 5th with hourly values exceeding 35 mm/hour and a peak of 55 mm/hour around midnight (Cairo Montenotte, Acqui Terme). Subsequently, on the 5th (second phase), the precipitation extended to the areas of Astigiano and Cuneese. In many locations in the basins of the Tanaro, Bormida, and Belbo rivers, rainfall exceeded 200 mm in 24 hours. The maximum accumulation over two days was recorded in Levice (CN) with 293.8 mm; the maximum for one day was also recorded in Levice with 264.6 mm (Luino, 1999). In the third phase of the event, the most intense precipitation affected the pre-Alpine belt between the Pellice Valley and the Sesia Valley in the afternoon and evening of the 5th, easing in the morning of the 6th. On the 6th, precipitation practically ceased in the southern part of the region, while it continued in the central-northern part, with modest hourly intensity, but still with significant daily totals."

During the flooding event, the Tanaro reached record flow values never before achieved in the century: The stretch between the municipality of Ormea and the confluence with the Stura di Demonte near Cherasco was particularly devastated by the flooding event, where the Tanaro almost completely destroyed most of the civil structures present (houses, bridges, roads, etc.), also permanently altering the shape of its bed and the valley floor over large stretches. The municipalities affected by the flood wave included: The cities of Ceva, Alba, and Asti were particularly hard hit, flooded for 1/3 of their surface area, and especially Alessandria, submerged by almost 50%, where 14 people lost their lives."

The first river overflowed in the early hours of the morning on November 1, affecting the area around the old Araceli church and Viale Rumor, with the nearby Querini park turned into a swamp. Consequently, the provincial headquarters of the Red Cross and UNICEF located in Contrà Torretti were evacuated. At 7:30, the Bacchiglione also overflowed at the Ponte degli Angeli, blocking access from the north and east to the historic center; however, the Olympic Theatre was spared thanks to the activation of three pumps (added to the two always present in the famous Palladian structure). The waters also flooded Contrà San Pietro, Corso Padova, Via IV Novembre, the riverside areas of San Biagio/San Marco, and the area around the Menti Stadium. The Bacchiglione overflowed again at the Viale Diaz bridge, blocking traffic on one of the main arteries of the outer ring road, flooding the San Paolo neighborhood (sports hall, swimming pools, athletics field) and the Carmini area with the northern part of Corso Fogazzaro. The Santa Bertilla area (customs and fruit and vegetable market) was also flooded, as was the Viale Trento area. In the afternoon, the Retrone overflowed in the S. Agostino neighborhood, and all residents on the ground floors of the Debba neighborhood were evacuated. Traffic in the city was paralyzed: the A4 motorway was closed, as well as the Southern Bypass and all railway lines that start or pass through the city. Urban mobility bus lines operated by AIM were also altered, and some lines were suspended due to the impossibility of traveling through the city streets. Twenty-one electrical cabins ended up underwater, leaving over 3,000 users without power. These are the data from the flood: As soon as the waters receded, Mayor Achille Variati made an appeal for any volunteers who could help the city and the people of Vicenza return to normalcy soon. The next day, more than 200 people showed up to provide assistance, first to the AIM Valore Ambiente workers to clean the streets and then to the citizens. In four days, the number of volunteers reached 2,483 people who, in three daily shifts meeting in Piazza Matteotti, were dispatched to the most critical points in the city. On November 3, almost all schools reopened, and the usual Thursday city market was confirmed; on the same day, Guido Bertolaso arrived in Vicenza, declaring a state of crisis and bringing the army to the city. Following Bertolaso's visit, among others, Silvio Berlusconi and Umberto Bossi visited on November 9. On November 11, the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, arrived in the provincial capital, at the explicit invitation of the mayor. The President first went to Piazza Matteotti (where volunteers awaited him with a personalized vest) and then to the town hall. \"You have shown that it is not true that you are waiting for help from the State, that you do not ask but do, that you have understood how in a moment like this cleaning is a noble job. No one was ashamed to put their hands in the mud and use a broom\" (Giorgio Napolitano in his speech to the volunteers during his visit to the city on November 11). Following the flood, 46 Vicentine artists (including Los Locos, Stefano Centomo, and the Lost) joined together in the style of Artists United for Abruzzo, recording the piece \"Un cuore grande così,\" the proceeds of which will go to the flood victims."

On November 16, 2010 (just 15 days after the most critical situation), volunteers were requested to help package sandbags, and precautionary evacuations of some schools affected by flooding on November 1 were carried out. On December 24, 2010, given the upcoming Christmas holidays, the municipality called upon the American army stationed at Ederle barracks, as well as on March 16, 2011 (the celebration of Italy's unity).

The Frassine also overflowed, causing numerous floods. On the night of November 1-2, 2010, in Veggiano, the Tesina Padovano broke the right bank before merging with the Bacchiglione, shortly after the Fratta pump station, flooding a large part of the municipal territory on November 2, 2010. The force of the water flattened 40 meters of embankment (which would only be partially repaired with giant boulders brought by helicopter days later), forcing the evacuation of 880 people. Also in the territory of the municipality of Veggiano, the Tesinella (which comes from the municipality of Grisignano di Zocco) overflowed, and numerous springs opened along the banks of other tributaries (Ceresone). For over a week, the water level exceeded one and a half meters, with peaks over 2 meters in the lowest areas. One of the most affected areas by the flood was the Bassa Padovana, where 22% of the territory was inundated. The embankment of the Frassine River suddenly gave way in the Prà di Botte area (a collapse of 150 meters of embankment), flooding the municipalities of Megliadino San Fidenzio, Saletto, Montagnana, Ospedaletto Euganeo, and Este; 23 million cubic meters of water poured into the area. A couple of hours after the disaster, another drainage, the Vampadore, overflowed, flooding Megliadino San Vitale and Casale di Scodosia. Subsequently, the municipalities of Carceri and Vighizzolo d'Este were also invaded by the waters of the Brancaglia canal (although to a much lesser extent). The landfill present in Este was immediately closed as water managed to enter the facilities. During the flood period, a vast lake could be observed from the Euganean Hills, stretching for dozens of kilometers. On November 17 and 18, there were new overflows, particularly of the Bacchiglione River, which flooded Bovolenta in particular. The same happened on December 25, also in Bovolenta."

In Monteforte, 6 million cubic meters of water and mud poured in, causing damage to 759 private properties, 146 businesses, and 25 farms. On the morning of November 1, 2010, the water from the Tramigna stream, a tributary of the Alpone, broke the embankment and began to overflow in Soave. A part of the area within the medieval walls and the entire outer part up to the middle school were flooded with water, which flowed from the Alpone up the Tramigna. With this flooding in Soave, about 600 private properties, 120 businesses, and 22 farms suffered damage.

The overflow of various watercourses caused flooding and significant damage in the countryside between the basins of the Ombrone, Albegna, Fiora, Nestore, and Paglia rivers and in the town of Albinia in the municipality of Orbetello, a fraction that remained completely flooded with about 150 displaced persons due to the overflow of the Albegna River, out of a total of about 700 displaced persons throughout the province. Cultural heritage was also affected with the collapse of a Renaissance bastion and a section of the walls of Magliano in Tuscany. Numerous infrastructures were rendered unusable, including the State Road 1 Via Aurelia and the Tyrrhenian Railway (reopened in the afternoon of November 16, 2012) which were interrupted near Albinia, along with many local roads, due to the severe damage caused by the disastrous effects of the bad weather. In Grosseto, a record flood of the Ombrone was recorded, which remained in floodplain for three days, lasting longer than that of 1966 but without major damage in the city, despite the panic in the fraction of Istia d'Ombrone where the water reached some houses near the bridge; the fractions of Rispescia and Alberese, moreover, remained isolated for two days. At the provincial level, the event is comparable to the Grosseto flood of November 4, 1966, with the difference that the 2012 event hit the southern sector of the province harder, while the 1966 event caused the most damage along the Ombrone Valley, in the central-northern part of the provincial territory. Intense rainfall also affected the area of Mount Amiata, including the Sienese side, as well as a vast area of Lazio and Umbria straddling the Laziale Maremma, Tuscia, and Orvietano, where exceptional floods occurred, leading to overflows of some right tributaries of the Tiber, including the Nestore, with 1000 m³/sec. at Marsciano, submerged by the overflow with significant damage, and especially the Paglia, its main right tributary, which with an extraordinary flood of 1,500 m³/sec completely submerged the lower part of the municipality of Orvieto causing significant damage."

Meanwhile, an extensive high-pressure area was strengthening over the Balkans, acting as a block to the eastward movement of disturbances, thereby reinforcing the warm and humid sirocco wind drawn towards Italy by the low pressure present over the western Mediterranean. As a result, in the evening, the disturbance intensified, fueled by the sirocco, generating strong thunderstorms during the night between Versilia, Garfagnana, Lunigiana, and the Pisa coastline, reaching the city of Livorno, all areas where rainfall accumulations between 100 and 250 millimeters were recorded in just a few hours. Between the morning and early afternoon of Sunday, November 11, 2012, cooler and drier air arriving from the Atlantic managed to invade Tuscany for a few hours, bringing a temporary and relative improvement in the weather; however, the blocking action of the high pressure over the Balkans, opposing the now deep low pressure over the western Mediterranean, kept a strong and humid sirocco wind alive between the Strait of Sicily and the southern Tyrrhenian Sea. By late afternoon, the sirocco again reached southern Tuscany through a warm front that - due to the relative positions of low and high pressures near Italy, and the presence at high altitude of a jet stream extending in the same direction as the front - remained stationary in place for about 30 hours. Along the warm front, a very intense mesoscale convective system was generated, that is, a particularly extensive thunderstorm that brought heavy rains and downpours between the Grosseto Maremma, part of the province of Siena and the province of Viterbo, and the Tyrrhenian Umbria. The thunderstorm renewed its structure, continuously regenerating from 6 PM on Sunday, November 11, until 11 PM on Monday, November 12, 2012, when the bad weather rapidly eased. The improvement in the weather was favored by the formation of a new low pressure over Morocco, which again drew the humid air pushed by the sirocco not towards Tuscany but towards Sardinia (first) and the Balearic Islands (later)."

Below are some rainfall records recorded during the flood event by some stations of the Regional Hydrological Service of Tuscany: In addition to the aforementioned daily rainfall records, following the precipitation of November 12, 2012, various rain gauge stations in the affected area recorded a new monthly total precipitation record with 18 days still available to further increase the record: among them, the hydrological stations of Abbadia San Salvatore and Piancastagnaio in the province of Siena, on the slopes of Mount Amiata from which the valley of the Paglia River originates, in addition to the already mentioned rain gauge stations of Orbetello-San Donato, Scansano-Pomonte, and Roccalbegna-Usi, and the hydrological stations of Magliano in Toscana-Poggio Perotto, Manciano, Marsiliana, Manciano-Capanne, Pitigliano in the Tufo Area, and Santa Fiora on the Grosseto side of Amiata; other stations, however, recorded precipitation accumulations between November 1 and 12, 2012, close to the historical monthly record, which could be surpassed by the end of the month in case of further precipitation. We also report the data recorded in the immediate vicinity of the Grosseto borders, for example, the two meteorological stations related to Acquapendente (VT) managed by MeteoAquesio. The first, located at an altitude of 340 m a.s.l. (locality Fornace), recorded, in just under 40 hours, an accumulation of 256 mm. The second, located at an altitude of 734 m a.s.l. (located at the Monte Rufeno nature reserve), recorded, in just under 40 hours, a rainfall accumulation of 465 mm. This last station found itself for several hours right in the most active part of the trajectory of the self-reinforcing thunderstorm, recording a record accumulation accompanied by very high rain rate values."

Violent downpours unleashed from early morning on the Apuan Alps, affecting the entire upper basin of the Serra and Vezza streams (the latter merging into a single watercourse at Seravezza, the Versilia) on the western watershed, and the entire upper part of the Turrite di Gallicano stream basin on the eastern watershed. The precipitation also affected part of the Camaiore river basin. All this while only a few drops of rain fell on the plain of Versilia. In a short time, the extraordinary precipitation (with peaks of over 150 mm in one hour in the upper Vezza basin) caused various landslides, and the watercourses quickly swelled. Following a brief pause that occurred late in the morning, the rains resumed even more intensely throughout the day from noon until early afternoon, before the deluge broke out. Copious rains shook the mountains and valleys near the village of Cardoso, where various minor streams give rise, near the settlement, to the Vezza stream. Meanwhile, in the plain, no one could remotely predict what was happening: in the Pietrasanta area, near the short stretch of the Versilia river, only 5–10 mm of rain had fallen. The civil protection agency was activated, taking care, around 2:00 PM, to check the rainfall values on the Apuan Alps, discovering that one of the hydrometers near the Pomezzana center in the upper valley of the Vezza stream recorded a record cumulative precipitation value, with 440 mm in just 8 hours and a maximum peak of 157 mm in one hour. Fearing that some sudden flood wave could occur, the levels of the rivers were immediately checked, especially the Versilia, which at first glance appeared to be, after the large flood wave in the morning, deceptively decreasing."

                "content": "Around 1:00 PM in the upper valley, the Vezza stream (upper section of the Versilia river) began its devastating run down towards the center of Cardoso: here, according to eyewitnesses, numerous booms were first heard coming from the mountains, after which repeated waves of water, mud, and debris up to 4-5 meters high arrived from the gullies of the tributary streams near the village, which was thus hit and almost completely destroyed. The speed and sudden violence of the event were justified by the fact that since the morning, the heavy rains, combined with the drought that had afflicted the area for months, had made the already unstable slopes of the Apuan Alps even more fragile, causing enormous landslides of earth, debris, and logs that had blocked, with temporary barriers, all the valleys of the watercourses upstream of Cardoso that give rise to the Vezza stream; thus, various ephemeral water basins had formed which, collapsing all together in the early afternoon under the incessant rainfall, led to a catastrophic flood wave. Among the people who lost their lives was little Alessio Ricci, after whom the elementary school on Via Pontenuovo in Pietrasanta has been named since 2020: he was only 8 years old when he was swallowed by the river's flood. After devastating Cardoso, the flood continued down the Vezza stream and first hit the center of Ponte Stazzemese (where it reached the second floor of the houses, partially collapsing an entire hotel) before reaching Ruosina, where it submerged the entire settlement, almost completely erasing the valley floor road. Additional water contributions arrived at the Vezza from every side valley, further fueling its flood. Around 3:00 PM, the flood arrived furiously at the town of Seravezza, which was largely submerged by 2-3 meters of water; in this stretch, the Vezza stream then received from the right the flood of its main tributary, the Serra stream, and changing its name from this confluence to \"Versilia river,\" it continued impetuously and overflowing with debris downstream, literally causing a malfunction (when it marked a value of 4.50 m above the zero hydrometric level) of the only hydrometer present along its river stretch. Therefore, no other data regarding the maximum flood height is known except for the peak flow value, estimated after the event, at about 571 m³/s, an absolutely exceptional and uncontrollable value for a modest river like the Versilia. After Seravezza, the Versilia overflowed and destroyed all the bridges near the centers of Ripa, Corvaia, and Vallecchia, leaving its valley stretch and finding an outlet in the plain of Versilia: in this stretch, the river (channeled and diverted in the past centuries into an artificial bed that flows near Cinquale di Montignoso) literally overflowed near the locality of San Bartolomeo in Pietrasanta due to the overtopping and subsequent collapse of a large section of its left bank, thus creating a new course southward, following the ancient path of its old flow bed, causing an extensive flood of the entire western portion of the municipality of Pietrasanta up to the fraction of Marina di Pietrasanta, Forte dei Marmi, and part of the municipality of Montignoso. Meanwhile, the tragedy also struck the eastern slope of the Apuan Alps in Garfagnana: in the upper valley of the Turrite stream, the center of Fornovolasco was literally devastated by the flood of the watercourse. Further downstream, however, the damage was minimal thanks to the presence of an artificial lake on the watercourse that, completely empty for maintenance, was able to accommodate and slow down much of the flood, saving the center located further downstream in Gallicano. Around 6:00 PM, the rain gauges in Pomezzana and Retignano, in Alta Versilia, showed cumulative precipitation values of 478 and 401 mm respectively over 13 hours. That of Fornovolasco, in Garfagnana, was 408 mm. This tragedy, considered one of the worst floods to ever hit Tuscany after the Florence flood of 1966, also caused a high number of victims: by the end of the emergency, there would be 13 dead, almost all in Cardoso, and one missing."

Within a few hours, an enormous amount of rain fell. In no time, the tributaries of the main rivers became uncontrollable and overflowed, bringing all sorts of debris downstream. The flood wave effect spread to the major rivers, Vara and Magra, which overflowed into the plains around the villages of Borghetto di Vara, Brugnato, Ameglia, and Pontremoli, Villafranca in Lunigiana, and Aulla. The disaster also affected the nearby Cinque Terre in the province of La Spezia: the water carried huge amounts of mud and debris along the natural drainage in the villages of Vernazza and Monterosso, and the main roads turned into raging rivers, carrying everything they dragged out to sea. The flood deposit in the main street of Vernazza measured several meters in thickness. Communications became extremely difficult: there were also significant damages to road infrastructures with landslides and mudslides on various provincial roads (resulting in the isolation of some inland locations), closure of the A12 motorway section between the toll booths of Sestri Levante and Deiva Marina due to a landslide on the southbound lane, and disruptions on the Levantine railway line. On the A12, the landslide involved a truck, and rescuers managed to extract the driver, who was miraculously saved. The state road 1 Via Aurelia was interrupted by multiple landslides, and the railway was blocked by a mudslide in Vernazza. Dozens of small towns in the Val di Vara became unreachable, except by helicopter, and telecommunications were interrupted. Further south in the reference watershed, the effects of the flood were felt in the municipality of Ameglia, at the mouth of the Magra River: in three years, the fourth overflow was recorded, and this time the most affected (in addition to houses completely invaded by mud) was the Colombiera bridge, which collapsed for the second time: a yacht was dislodged by the river's fury and struck the central span of the bridge, destroying it. More than a week after the flooding event, in anticipation of a new and maximum weather alert across the region (classified as \"Alert 2\" by the meteorological and hydrological functional center of the Civil Protection of the Liguria Region, expected from 10 PM on November 3 to 6 PM on November 6 in the Ligurian maritime basins of Ponente, Centro, Levante, and Padani di Ponente), evacuation orders for the population were issued by the respective mayors of Vernazza and Borghetto di Vara as a precautionary measure. In Val di Vara, landslides continued for days, blocking road communications. On November 5, Camisano (Ameglia) and Pignone were evacuated, while Corvara and Bracelli (in the municipality of Beverino) were isolated, and new evacuations took place in Calice al Cornoviglio, where the roads were now opening into terrifying chasms. In ten days, 4 bridges collapsed, and 20 roads were closed between Montemarcello, Rocchetta di Vara, Brugnato, Calice, Pignone, Beverino, Corniglia, Monterosso, and Vernazza."

After the 1960s, the riverbanks were raised twice to reach a total height of 5 meters, through the application of two layers of unreinforced concrete that were not statically connected to each other. The foundations of the banks were affected by the insertion of a protective layer of rocks."

Recent cases of flooding in Liguria confirm that this circumstance occurs in Mediterranean environments, but not only, of the Italian peninsula."

In Monterosso al Mare and Vernazza, the controversial issue is the covering of the channels, which became pressurized with the fallen rain. Even in the Cinque Terre, cementification is not ruled out as a cause of the lack of water management: in Monterosso, the council granted permission for the construction of 30 villas by the Meschi family. In Brugnato, the Friday before the tragedy, the municipal council voted to approve the construction of a huge outlet that was supposed to be built right in the area devastated by the flood. The outlet was then regularly constructed and inaugurated in 2014. The method of cementification of the territory is also under discussion in Aulla, where a large part of the constructions of the last fifty years have been built within the natural riverbed of the Magra River. At the beginning of the flood wave that invaded the streets of the town, it seems there was a failure of the dam of the sedimentation basin to the north, near Villafranca in Lunigiana. In the days following October 25, the institutional authorities, who visited Aulla, were heavily contested by the local people: among them was the mayor of Pontremoli, Lucia Baracchini, and Minister Altero Matteoli."

                "content": "The floods of the Vara and the tidal part of the Magra represent another controversy: public opinion points the finger at the lack of dredging of riverbeds, regulated by Law 183/1989, which classifies the extraction of inert materials along rivers as soil defense interventions, thus placing, in principle, the public interest in proper hydraulic maintenance as the only act that allows extraction activities in rivers. As a result, pending the adoption of Basin Plans, extraction activities have been suspended. Despite popular beliefs, rivers would be flooded with sediment material; however, there is a study commissioned by the interregional Basin Authority of the Magra River, developed by the Faculty of Civil Engineering at the University of Florence, which states that the valley sections of the rivers have not increased sediment levels, but rather are incised. Another important point seems to be the state of neglect of secondary watercourses and the tributaries of the Vara and Magra rivers. According to some testimonies, in the municipality of Follo, affected by the flood in the plain, it seems that the water did not come directly from the riverbed, but rather from the inability of the tributary streams to drain into it. This would have caused damage to the culverts (some literally exploded) and their overflow would have flooded the buildings present in an area classified by the PAI as floodable."

Many of them responded to calls made on social networks like Facebook: students, workers, spiritual heirs of those \"mud angels\" from Florence. A particular case was that of the \"red bands,\" almost 400 volunteers from all over Italy (Como, Naples, Pavia, Trento, Parma, Rome, Livorno, etc.) who identify themselves with a red band on their arm. The idea reproduces an ancient custom of the Lunigiana labor movement, which, in a late 1800s photo, depicted labor teams from Pontremolese with red bands around their waists and arms. Special attention has been paid, from the beginning, to the nature of the aid, especially financial. An example is the case of Monterosso, where a fundraising campaign was launched by Repubblica and Sky for the \"rescue\" of the \"Enrico Fermi\" elementary school, but some testimonies revealed that the school building had not suffered significant damage that would prevent its use. The question arises as to what the school will be saved from. A year after that tragedy, the first assessments of the reconstruction and the safety of the Spezzino territory have begun. For example, according to some sources, the media and the highest authorities have portrayed the reconstruction of Vernazza as a virtuous example. However, some citizens have compiled a dossier indicating that the situation is far from virtuous. In general, the commitment to safeguarding the territory does not seem particularly significant, with urgent works being done, a lack of planning interventions, and continuous issuance of building permits for extremely invasive large projects. A shocking example is the collapse of a landslide on the Via dell'Amore in Riomaggiore, following just a few hours of rain."

Unlike the previous ones, this flood did not affect the outskirts or peripheral neighborhoods but the main town and was not an unexpected event. The alarm had indeed been raised in the early hours of the afternoon of November 15, and the situation became serious around 8 PM, when the level of the Bisenzio became truly concerning, leading to the decision to close the historic bridge of the main town. Around 10 PM, the waters of the Bisenzio overflowed into the Santa Maria neighborhood, passing through the houses along the bank, but about twenty minutes later, the Bisenzio broke the bank-road on the opposite side, in the area of the Corti district, and the flooding of the main town began. The waters invaded a large part of the main town, particularly the districts of Corti and Case Nove and the area of the Central Post Office, reaching the areas of Maccione and via Palagetta. The only victim of the flood was an eighty-three-year-old woman, Dina Nistri, residing in the Corti area, close to the breach, who was swept away by the waters in her garden. The damages from the flood, which would later trigger a fierce controversy, were estimated at 144 billion lire of the time. Since that November 1991, hydraulic restoration and the care of the waterways in the area would become one of the top priorities of the various municipal administrations."

The flood of the Bisenzio arrived unexpectedly in the capital in the late evening of November 21, when the river level became alarming, and shortly after, the waters began to overflow into the city streets through the windows of the riverside houses. The fate of the municipal capital seemed sealed when the Bisenzio broke the bank at the bend of Via XXIV Maggio near the first houses of the San Martino district. The breach was about fifty meters long, and from it, the river's waters poured into San Martino itself, then reaching San Piero a Ponti and the plain of Sant'Angelo a Lecore, where the Ombrone Pistoiese had also broken its banks in the meantime. In some areas, the waters reached a level of two meters. At the same time, the Bisenzio and the Marinella stream also broke their banks near the Capalle district, and their waters reached the level of the first floor of the houses. The only victim of the flood was a forty-year-old farmer from San Piero a Ponti, Emilio Scuffi, who suffered a heart attack at the sight of the waters flooding his home. The rescue efforts were quite ineffective, although the now-dominant fascist regime did not allow protests or excessive demands, also due to the absolute unpreparedness of the municipal administration, which in previous years had even sold two barges, bought for potential emergencies, because they had never been used. The damage from the flood was significant, and there were no reimbursements, although the repair of the banks by the Civil Engineering was quick and effective. The collapsed pedestrian bridge of San Martino was permanently restored only in 1939. The poor organization of the rescue efforts was ultimately fatal for the last mayor, Emilio Cioppi, who was replaced in the following months by a government-appointed podestà."

In the morning, approximately 120 mm of rain fell particularly on the basin of the latter (which brought the total for the week to 330 mm), thus overloading all the tributaries of the Esaro coming from the Cutro area. In the locality of \"Isola Capo Rizzuto station,\" an uncontrollable and violent flood of the same river formed (later calculated with a flow rate of over 1000 m³/s). The flood reached the \"Gabelluccia\" district in the western outskirts of Crotone around noon: a mass of water and mud submerged the ground floors of the houses in the same neighborhood, subsequently extending towards the industrial area, affecting both the buildings on the left bank, which had already been flooded previously due to the overflow of the Papaniciaro tributary, and those on the right bank, near the \"Gesù\" district, after which the water also reached the historic city center, channeling along via Nicoletta. The flood caused 6 fatalities (Paolo Pupa, Angela Trovato, Luca Buscema, Michela Cicchetto, Luca Tavano, and Bruno Comisso) and immense damage: numerous industrial prefabricated buildings were swept away by the water, and the commercial and industrial area of the city was heavily devastated. In some streets of the inhabited center, the water even reached four meters in height. The effects of the overflow were further aggravated by heavy illegal construction: the neighborhoods of Gabelluccia and Gesù, the latter built close to the Montecatini plant, had indeed emerged in the 1980s, in the floodplain expansion areas.

The causes were the intense rains that occurred in the days leading up to it along the basin of the Ombrone River and its tributary, the Orcia. This was part of a widespread event of heavy rainfall that affected much of Italy during those days, leading to similar floods on the same day in Florence, Venice, Chioggia, Pisa, and other cities in central-northern Italy. The waters of the Ombrone broke the banks on the morning of November 4, 1966, overflowing and flooding the countryside, causing significant damage in the provincial capital, where in some areas the water reached three and a half meters in height. The flood was not a simple overflow but rather a collapse at four points of the Ombrone River's embankment; this was partly caused by the sirocco winds that hindered the outflow to the sea, as well as by the embankment of the bridge on the Aurelia state road, commonly known as the Mussolini bridge. There was only one death since November 4 was a holiday at the time, and therefore all major activities were halted. To understand the magnitude of the phenomenon, it is important to note that the average flow of the Ombrone River is 25 m³/s, and on that day it exceeded 4000 m³/s. At the Acquisti Farm, in the countryside of Braccagni north of the city, one victim was counted, the buttero Santi Quadalti, who was swept away by the flood while trying to save his herds, and he was awarded the gold medal."

Another factor that influenced this was the presence, above and below the city level, of four main water flows: the Canale Passo di Rigano, the Papireto, the Kemonia, and the Oreto River; some of these channels were artificially diverted below street level. In addition to the large volume of water, the city was hit by a strong north wind that destroyed several walls."

The damages were estimated to exceed 45 billion lire. The fury of the waters caused extensive landslides, one of which, detached from the slope of a recently deforested mountain, swept away the village of Molina and a nearby monumental aqueduct bridge, called \"Ponte del Diavolo.\" The two streams Bonea and Cavaiola coming from Cava de' Tirreni carried down such a quantity of debris that it expanded and increased the current beach of Vietri sul Mare known as Marina. The entire Salerno coast changed its appearance, resulting in numerous points being more advanced due to the influx of debris. In Maiori, the high neighborhoods, a large part of the historic center, and some buildings along the Reginna stream were damaged, which, blocked by the trunks of trees carried down by the waters, eroded the foundations of the buildings along its course, causing their facades to collapse. Subsequently, the destroyed houses were replaced with modern buildings, which currently characterize the center of Maiori. In the Town Hall, there is a plaque that remembers and lists the names of the 37 victims of the flood in October 1954."

These two domains are well differentiated and described by numerous geological surveys conducted in historical and recent times. They constitute two sets of different densities, with compact limestone, and the layers of pyroclasts being more loose and incoherent. These two layers were held together by natural vegetation, as well as by terraced cultivation practices. The abandonment of the latter has led to the slopes being invaded by ruderal vegetation, which has been burned multiple times, and which did not ensure the same continuity between limestone and pyroclasts."

This event caused the dissolution of the continuity between limestone and pyroclasts, leading to the catastrophic sliding of the latter over the former. On May 5 at 3:00 PM, the first landslide detached from Mount Pizzo d'Alvano, grazing the underlying inhabited areas, while the rain fell incessantly on Sarno, Bracigliano, and Siano. The Salerno prefecture was notified of the occurrence of landslides only around 4:30 PM. At 5:00 PM, several landslides and debris flows began to slide down, overwhelming Sarno and nearby locations, destroying dozens of homes. Meanwhile, news of a landslide in Siano also arrived. The first rescue teams reached the valley after about an hour, just as a mud and debris avalanche struck Quindici, located on the opposite side of Mount Pizzo d'Alvano, burying the town and the Casamanzi fraction. Shortly after, the Episcopio fraction of Sarno was hit by a massive flow that destroyed the entire settlement. During the evening, while other landslides affected Sarno and Quindici, causing some blackouts, several dead and injured were extracted from the mud: the latter were transported to the largest hospital in the area, Villa Malta in Sarno. But the situation took on catastrophic proportions between 11:31 PM and midnight on May 6, when a massive landslide again overwhelmed Sarno, invading the Villa Malta hospital and burying two doctors, three nurses, the hospital porter, and five patients (including two children) under the mud. The first helicopters flew over the area only after 6:00 AM."

This is communicated for the purpose of activating any necessary measures to ensure the safeguarding of public and private safety.\" Once the severity of the situation was confirmed, numerous detachments of law enforcement, firefighters, and volunteers from all over Italy rushed to the site to assist the affected populations. In addition to the high number of victims - including several children - many people were rescued from the mudslide; among them was the current deputy mayor Roberto Robustelli, then a little over twenty years old, who was pulled alive after more than three days from the under-stair area where he had been dragged by the force of the sludge. After the initial emergency phase was over, several criminal proceedings were opened against members of the municipal administration of Sarno, aimed at determining any responsibilities. On May 5, 2010, Mayor Gerardo Basile, initially found not guilty regarding the charge of multiple involuntary manslaughter in the first two levels of judgment, had his appeal sentence annulled by the Court of Cassation. This judgment - motivated by the fact that, according to the Court, the mayor's conduct was \"passive\" in managing the events - referred the case back to the Court of Appeal in Naples for a new trial. In December 2011, the Court of Appeal sentenced Basile to five years in prison, confirmed by the Cassation in 2013; the sentence was then reduced by three years due to the 2006 pardon, while the remaining two years were served under probation in community service."

The warm winds blowing over the mountains also melted the early snowfalls that had occurred. The millers and residents of the houses by the river were therefore prepared to face the flood but not the magnitude it would have. Indeed, measures were taken to reinforce the moorings at San Lorenzo, at the Filippini, in Via Sottoriva, and in other more exposed areas; floodgates were also used to protect doors and windows on the ground floors. Among the causes of the violent flood were the changes to the river's course in Trentino, made during the construction of the Brenner railway, and the arrangement of many streams that increased the speed of the flood wave. There was also talk of agricultural works that had altered the river's hydrography upstream of the city. September 14 was the most terrifying day. Many mills broke the chains with which they had been previously secured and were swept away by the current. One crashed against the Ponte Nuovo, bringing it down. On September 17, over two-thirds of Verona were submerged by water; boats could not even pass under the arches of Porta Borsari. At Ponte Pietra, the water had reached a height of 4 meters and 50 above the warning signal, while the estimated speed of the current was 20 km/h. The mobilization of the army was immediate and essential, arriving with landing craft and military engineering units from Legnago and Peschiera del Garda. The city found itself enveloped in darkness, many people were isolated, and some houses collapsed. In the area of Piazza Isolo, 11 residents died in the collapse of their home.

The printing house of the newspaper l'Arena was also flooded and had to suspend publications for a few days. The city, after the waters receded, was covered in mud and other sediments up to human height. Work immediately began to restore normalcy. Despite the belief that it would take years of work or even doubts about the city's ultimate survival, a remedy was found in relatively short time. These city restoration works will culminate in the securing of the Adige River through the burial of the Canale dell'Acqua Morta and the construction of embankments as a riverbank."

High water levels occurred in the Meuse basin after a period of persistent rain. On December 20, 1993, the Meuse overflowed its banks for the first time, and on December 22, this happened in several places in the province of Limburg. The areas around Roermond and Venlo, specifically the villages of Gennep, Itteren, and Borgharen, located on the eastern bank, were affected. On the western bank, Neer was the hardest hit. About 8% (18,000 ha) of the area of the province of Limburg was underwater. Several municipalities in Brabant along the Meuse also experienced water damage. Approximately 12,000 people were evacuated. The total damage amounted to 254 million guilders. Never before had such a high discharge been measured: 3,120 m3/s. In Borgharen, the Meuse reached a record height of 45.90 meters above sea level. Just over a year later, in January 1995, the areas along the Meuse were again hit by large-scale flooding."

From May 15 to May 20, 2010, 350 to 370 mm of rain fell in the Czech catchment area of the Oder. This quickly led to the formation of an extreme flood. At the Czech-Polish border, on May 17, a flow of about 2100 cubic meters per second was recorded, the second largest since records began. In 1997, over 2800 cubic meters per second flowed here. The third largest flood is considered to be that of August 1985 with 1155 cubic meters per second. The flood retention basin Buków (Oder-km 29–32.5), completed in 2002, was opened on the night of May 17 to 18 and relieved the Oder by about 300 cubic meters per second, reducing the flow in the Oder from 74% to now 63% of the peak flow of 1997. At the downstream Oder gauge Miedonia, the peak level on May 18 was accordingly 1.6 m below the peak value of 1997, making it still the second highest water level recorded there since 1947."

Since all three riparian states had made huge efforts for flood protection after the devastating Oder flood in 1997, the damages remained far below those of the summer of 1997. At the same time, and due to the same precipitation event, the Vistula basin was also hit by a catastrophic flood with huge damages and loss of life."

From May 15 to May 20, 2010, 350 to 370 mm of rain fell in the Czech catchment area of the Oder. This quickly led to the formation of an extreme flood. At the Czech-Polish border, on May 17, a flow of about 2100 cubic meters per second was recorded, the second largest since records began. In 1997, over 2800 cubic meters per second flowed here. The third largest flood is considered to be that of August 1985 with 1155 cubic meters per second. The flood retention basin Buków (Oder-km 29–32.5), completed in 2002, was opened on the night of May 17 to 18 and relieved the Oder by about 300 cubic meters per second, reducing the flow in the Oder from 74% to now 63% of the peak flow of 1997. At the downstream Oder gauge Miedonia, the peak level on May 18 was accordingly 1.6 m below the peak value of 1997, but it is still the second highest water level recorded there since 1947."

Alert level IV was declared on May 26 and 28 for these river sections and remained in effect until the end of May. Alert level III applied to the entire downstream section of the Oder. It was not until June 23, 2010, that the entire German/Polish section of the Oder was free of alert levels."

After the water levels of the rivers had already been very high due to prolonged rain in May and June, hot days in early summer caused intense snowmelt. In mid-July, continuous rain set in (according to the Bernese Chronicle of Diebold Schilling, it rained in torrents for three days without interruption in Ströme), which led to the flooding."

In the same department, the city of Moissac is the most affected by these devastating floods. The departments of Aude, Lot-et-Garonne (including Agen) and Tarn are also particularly impacted. These catastrophic events led to a national day of mourning on March 9, 1930 — for the first time in France in the 20th century — after the then President of the Republic, Gaston Doumergue, himself from the South of France, visited the site, accompanied by André Tardieu. The French government allocates significant financial aid to rebuild the devastated areas, supported by national and international solidarity (Yugoslavia, Netherlands, Morocco), particularly in Moissac, the most affected municipality by these exceptional floods described as the \"flood of the century.\" François Coty participates in the efforts by constructing four model farms designed by architects to withstand future floods, offering them in full ownership to deserving families. Pope Pius XI sends a check to the bishop of Montauban for the care of the victims. The number of deaths due to these floods is now estimated at around 700."

The municipality of Caylar received 448 mm of precipitation in 24 hours, which was a record for the Hérault department until September 16, 2023, when Roqueredonde received 550 mm in 24 hours. These rains followed a weather pattern above the norms for the region, with average temperatures being higher than normal, combined with a low-pressure area in the Bay of Biscay. The next day, the rains continued in Gard, especially in the morning, where the regions of Sommières and Nîmes were swept by a brief and violent storm accompanied by strong gusts of wind, as well as part of Ardèche, then the rain front crossed the Rhône, affecting the departments of Vaucluse and Drôme. The showers on September 22 were the result of a thunderstorm front of west/east flow blocked on the western flank of Mont Ventoux from the afternoon. With this thunderstorm system remaining stationary over part of the Ouvèze watershed, the municipality of Orange, northwest of the Vaucluse department, received 51 mm of cumulative rainfall, while Carpentras, south of the Dentelles de Montmirail, received 212 mm."

That same evening, the prefect of Vaucluse relayed this state of alert for the implementation of security and protection services. On September 22, 1992, two other messages from Météo France to Marignane, late at night and early in the morning, confirmed the alert by announcing storms of rare violence. Despite everything, the rain, which was heavy in Vaison-la-Romaine in the middle of the morning, stopped around noon. The city's rescue services faced several difficulties: the events took place on a Tuesday, the day of the weekly market, and there was an increased influx; the evacuation requests made to clients and tourists (who were numerous at the end of the summer season) at the municipal campsite, located upstream of the Roman bridge, had little effect. The first moderate shower (17.8 mm) fell between 10 a.m. and noon. It was followed, in the early afternoon, by a much more violent second shower (182.7 mm) that lasted until 3:15 p.m. The teachers at the Jules Ferry school, then located near the course of the Ouvèze, secured the students on the first floor of the building farthest from the river. The total rainfall in Entrechaux was 300 mm (300 liters of water per square meter) in six hours (perhaps a little more locally). For comparison, the annual average precipitation in Paris is 637 mm. During this meteorological event, nearly 1,320 km² received more than 100 mm of precipitation. The storm, of unprecedented violence, stagnated on the slopes of Mont Ventoux for several hours. It dumped 215 mm of water in Malaucène, 179 mm in Vaison, and 143 mm in Buis-les-Baronnies. The heavy rains upstream of Vaison-la-Romaine were such that a mudslide, about 50 cm deep, invaded and completely covered the municipal campsite around 3 p.m. A water height of 10 cm already covered the streets of the lower town. The first news arrived, there were deaths at the Moulin de César campsite. The area reserved for the associative camping À cœur joie — 450 pitches — was swept away. It was learned that there were many victims in the Théos neighborhood subdivision, located on the right bank, which was submerged by the floodwaters. At the same time, a torrent of mud swept through the municipal campsite, carrying everything in its path: caravans, vehicles, and campers. In the minutes that followed, at the Roman bridge, whose deck is located less than twenty meters from the river's normal level, the water reached 17 meters, which is 15 meters above its normal course. Images of caravans crashing against the Roman bridge are etched in memory. The fire station, located near the bed of the Ouvèze, was then flooded, along with the building and rescue equipment. The ORSEC Plan was triggered at 5 p.m. The water level only began to recede after 10 p.m. Of the three bridges on the Ouvèze, only the ancient Roman bridge withstood, despite some damage to the parapet."

                "content": "Later, we will learn that the same phenomenon has already occurred, at least once, in Vaison. In the municipal archives of the city, a deliberation dated August 1616 indicates that \"the city council had to repair the parapet of the Roman bridge destroyed by a flood that also swept away several houses.\" There is no mention of any victims. In the 17th century, the people of Vaison lived in the upper town, and around the cathedral, covering the ruins of ancient Vasio, there were only gardens. The risk was known but neglected. Before the tragedy, following the disaster of October 3, 1988, in Nîmes, engineer Ponton mentioned in his April 1989 report, 62 cities, including Vaison-la-Romaine, likely to be victims of flooding due to rain runoff. Jean-Pierre Mazeillier had described the Land Use Plan (POS) of Vaison as \"completely crazy\" when he took over the technical services of the town hall and could not find any trace of Ponton's report. The Deferre decentralization law had transferred urban planning authority from the prefect to the mayors in 1982. On October 14, 1983, the mayor at the time, André Thès, revised the POS and declared the right bank of the Ouvèze buildable for more than a kilometer. The area had not even been classified as a \"low flood zone.\" The price of land had multiplied by a factor greater than 10. Scientific studies have been conducted on the centennial flood of 1992. They provide reasons for the extent of the damage. In the area of the Salette torrent, a tributary of the Brégoux, which is itself a tributary of the Ouvèze, in the heart of the Dentelles de Montmirail, 200.5 millimeters of rain fell in the span of five hours. The figures are known thanks to the Bernardins station in Beaumes-de-Venise. This represented a volume of 4.2 million cubic meters of water that fell in the watershed of this torrent, which has an area of only 28 km². The report of the inquiry commission on \"the causes of the floods and the means to remedy them\" also mentions other reasons such as a geological impermeability specific to this Ouvèze valley but also aggravating anthropogenic modifications: \"an impermeabilization of the soils leading to urban rain runoff and finally the presence of constructions in the riverbed itself.\" The Ouvèze is a 123 km river, originating in Montauban-sur-l'Ouvèze, in the Drôme department, and flowing into the Rhône at Sorgues, after watering 28 municipalities. Many watercourses are tributaries of the Ouvèze, notably the Toulourenc, between Mollans-sur-Ouvèze and Entrechaux. Of the 820 km² of the Ouvèze watershed, 580 km² is located upstream of Vaison-la-Romaine."

                "content": "This tragedy of September 22 caused the death of more than 40 people, swept away by the Ouvèze or its tributaries. The most commonly reported number of victims is 46 dead, plus one in Beaumes-de-Venise, which is often forgotten in the statistics. Thirty-eight people lost their lives that day in the Haut-Vaucluse, including 34 in Vaison-la-Romaine. Among them were fifteen residents of the Theos housing estate and at least eleven campers from the Moulin de César campsite. This unprecedented flood struck many villages downstream from Vaison, also causing deaths: three in Séguret; an old farmer who went to look for his cow in Gigondas, which was found alive; four campers swept away by the waters of the Brégoux in Aubignan; a pedestrian who tried to cross the bridge swept away by the flood of the Salette in Beaumes-de-Venise, as well as four missing persons, including a six-month-old baby. Nine months later, in 1993, a body was found in the municipality of Roaix by a firefighter dog handler from Vaison. Without the courage of a firefighter who saved 36 people with a borrowed boat, the death toll would have been much higher. As the water receded on the morning of September 23, bulldozers and trucks were able to work in the streets to remove the wrecks of vehicles covered with river silt and all the debris it had carried. To prevent looting, the flooded area was cordoned off by the army, with soldiers monitoring the entrances to the city and the main affected villages and patrolling in front of the houses. During the first five years following the disaster, the investigation stalled. Only the prefect of Vaucluse, who was in office in 1965, was implicated in 1995. The judge closed the investigation at the beginning of 1998, after ordering new investigations into the studies conducted for building permits. These studies \"clearly implicated the systematic concreting of at-risk areas, particularly natural floodplain basins.\" Two years after the disaster, building permit applications were submitted to construct in the flood-prone areas of the city. Some survivors in Vaison were able to relocate to the clos d'Ariston, a plot purchased and serviced by the municipality. Few of them left the city, as the insurance companies reimbursed them well, while others were able to buy older properties."

In the five years following the disaster, 115 million francs worth of work was carried out, amounting to 17.5 million euros. Furthermore, this renovation had a revised higher cost. The final bill amounted to nearly 460 million euros in damages, including 20 million just for Vaison. Ultimately, for this single municipality, the works totaled about 26 million euros, of which nearly 8 were borne by Vaison and its 6,000 inhabitants. While everything was done to prevent a new disaster, it came at the cost of heavy indebtedness."

The riverbed was widened and the banks reinforced. Upstream, the municipal campsite was relocated and elevated. Where the Théos housing development once stood, huge stone blocks reinforced the bank, and a natural space was created. Further along, a health trail covers the former neighborhood of the Jardins de l'Ouvèze, and the Eminées and Magnans housing developments have become green spaces. The school was rebuilt. It is protected, like the lower town, by a long wall serving as a levee. Evacuation drills take place every year in all classes. If intervention is needed, the firefighters of Vaison, thanks to alert systems, are notified of a flood two hours in advance. Two non-negotiable hours, but enough to evacuate everyone. The alert is given through the installation of weather radars in Bollène and in the Gard. In 1992, according to the mayor at the time, there were none, but there was one in Nîmes named Mélody, which had been struck by lightning the night before..."

For an economic reason: moving would involve both buying land and rebuilding, and the insurance companies did not follow. However, a new activity zone has been created higher up, but it has only attracted two companies. Moreover, \"local media regularly echo the local urban planning plans (PLU) that are challenged and most often annulled a few months later by the courts. The reasons are almost systematically, in addition to formal irregularities, the transformation of agricultural land, often located in flood-prone areas or adjacent to them, into building land.\" The primary cause is that land prices have reached new heights throughout the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. For reasons of quality of life and sunshine, it is the region of France with the fastest-growing population due to the arrival of retirees as well as working families. Thus, for some, the temptation is great to want to multiply the value of agricultural land by twenty or thirty simply by classifying it as building land. In the event of a flood, even less severe than that of September 22, everyone knows that the damage would be considerable, including in terms of human lives."

It then moved east, stopping in the western neighborhoods of the city between Pegli, Sestri Ponente, and the Polcevera valley, where it unleashed its full power, causing a true flash flood. In about five hours, between 8:00 and 13:00, over 400 mm of rain fell on the heights of Sestri Ponente, 380 mm on those of Pegli, and about 300 mm in the lower Polcevera valley between Pontedecimo and the mouth of the stream. A few dozen more millimeters of rain could have caused the Polcevera and many other secondary streams to overflow, resulting in significant damage."

Almost the entire lower part of Sestri Ponente and Multedo was flooded: shops, garages, basements, squares, and streets suffered damage, from which the flow of water carried away parked cars. A worker from the nearby quarries of Monte Gazzo fell along with an embankment swallowed by the fury of the waters of the Chiaravagna stream and was found a few days later in the sea off Sestri Ponente: he was the only victim of the flooding event. The Molinassi stream, which flows covered by the Fincantieri warehouses in the last 440 meters, broke the right bank, an old stone wall, at the height of Piazza Clavarino, flooding the western part of Sestri Ponente and merging its waters with those that overflowed from the Cantarena stream in via Leoncavallo, under which it flows in the last 300 meters of its course. In the eastern part of the delegation, it was the Chiaravagna stream that overflowed at the dam created by the building at via Giotto 15, built right above its bed and then demolished in March 2013. The most western part was also flooded by the Marotto stream and the streams Zanino and Monferrato, which violently overflowed from the network of tunnels in which they had been channeled during the first half of the 20th century under the abandoned industrial warehouses of the former Multedo foundry and those that today house the Coop and other productive activities, and were discharged into the sea beyond the Genoa-Ventimiglia railway line, not far from the oil port docks. Other floods, fortunately without serious consequences, occurred in other low areas of the west such as the Multedo railway underpass, the one near Piazza Brin in Certosa, and throughout the Fiumara area in Sampierdarena."

The rise in the level of the Mēmele River caused by heavy summer rains on June 20 swept along logs carried by the river, flooded the streets of the old town of Bauska closest to the river, and destroyed part of the Mēmele Bridge. The rainy summer of 1928 caused floods in many places in Latvia and southern Estonia. During these years, there was active floating of logs cut down in the forest down the rivers to sawmills in Bauska, Jelgava, and Riga. By the beginning of June, a dangerously large accumulation of logs had formed near the Mēmele Bridge. However, the major floods began a couple of weeks later when the pressure of the Mēmele waters broke through log blockages about four kilometers before Bauska, and the logs carried by the current jammed at the Mēmele Bridge. Due to the rains, the water volume in the Mēmele doubled on June 20 and 21. The enormous log dam blocked the river and raised the water level by 6 meters above normal, flooding many city streets. The overflowing river swept away poorly secured log rafts, which jammed at the Mēmele Bridge, creating a wooden dam. Buildings and streets along the river were flooded. On Friday, June 22, at 4:00 AM, the logs carried by the current broke a section of the bridge about 10 meters long. The water and logs partially destroyed several buildings. The river water carved its way along the riverbank on the old town side, washing away and partially destroying riverside sheds, the Jewish synagogue, and several other buildings. The most affected by the floods were the Lower Mill owned by the German Stēbens, which suffered losses amounting to 8 million rubles, while the brewery of Teodors Lodiņš incurred losses of 300,000 rubles."

The Bauska municipality began organizing the removal of the logs, involving 350 workers for this task. Under the leadership of Mrs. Jura Varenā, the head of the Bauska branch of the Latvian Red Cross, the city ladies formed a relief committee that used funds provided by the Red Cross to distribute food—soup, bread, butter, meat, fish, sugar, etc.—to those affected by the floods for a couple of weeks. In the first few days, 300 people received assistance, with each person receiving help amounting to 64 santims per day. The destroyed bridge meant that Bauska no longer had land transport with 16 of the 20 parishes in the district. Trade in the market stopped, and industrial output decreased. Just a few weeks later, a raft bridge was opened for horse traffic, and a wooden walkway was built for pedestrians."

Its destructive capacity would only be matched 206 years later, on February 20, 2010, by the storm on the island of Madeira. Due to its tragic circumstances, it remains in the collective memory of the Madeiran people and is still commemorated today on the municipal holiday of Machico, on October 9."

On the morning of October 9, around eight o'clock, a period of precipitation began, although not very heavy, which would last for 12 hours, until around 8 PM. Shortly after 8 PM, the weather conditions worsened, the levels of precipitation increased significantly, and a stronger wind began to blow. Around 8:30 PM, the situation escalated, and the flow of the streams increased noticeably until, finally, it violently overflowed its banks. The conditions were set for one of the worst natural disasters to ever strike Madeira Island. The origin of such a great tragedy was an atmospheric situation characterized by the presence of southwest winds, thunderstorms, and heavy rainfall. The baldness of the mountains overlooking Funchal, clearly visible in the engravings of the time, and the lack of drainage for the streams within urban areas contributed to the worsening of the disaster. Faced with the seriousness of the situation, many inhabitants, caught by surprise, were unable to escape the danger, ultimately perishing. Some were caught in their escape by the strong currents that had overflowed the banks of the streams, many did not even attempt to flee, dying when their own houses collapsed or being crushed by the falling walls."

One of the particularly affected areas was the neighborhood of Santa Maria Maior. The walls of the Ribeira de João Gomes, whose flow had already increased due to the intense rainfall of the previous days, burst in three locations. The water that overflows the banks at these three points forms such violent currents that it destroys almost everything in its path and is responsible for the deaths of many dozens of people. According to reports from the time, entire streets and numerous buildings were swept out to sea. The very Parish Church of Our Lady of Calhau, located on the left bank of the river, succumbs to the violence of the waters. In one house in this area, 21 inhabitants die. In another building in Pelourinho, an English subject and 15 family members die. The estimated number of victims in this neighborhood is shocking; it is estimated that, in this area alone, the flood claimed the lives of about 200 people. The rivers of Santa Luzia and Bom Jesus are also unable to withstand the high flow of water, which ends up overflowing the banks and causing great destruction. The street of Ferreiros suffers considerable damage, with several residential and commercial houses destroyed. The description is similar for Rua dos Tanoeiros and Rua Direita, where the scene of destruction repeats itself."

The same archive describes as \"prodigious\" the fact that only 14 people perished (swept away by the intensity of the currents or buried in their own homes), given the intensity of the catastrophe. The historic Chapel of the Lord of Miracles (at the time referred to as the Chapel of Christ), one of the oldest on the Island of Madeira, was also affected, having been almost completely destroyed by the currents. From the original chapel, only the ogival door and the crosses of the frontispiece remained. The image of the crucified Christ was swept out to sea and considered lost; however, it would eventually be recovered, almost intact, by an American galley that delivered it to the Cathedral of Funchal. This event, considered miraculous by the inhabitants of the region, would lead to the renaming of the chapel to the Chapel of the Lord of Miracles, as well as to a pilgrimage (one of the largest on the island) that takes place every year on October 9, in honor of the Lord of Miracles. In addition to the Chapel of the Lord of Miracles, several churches, as well as the archives of Foros, chapels, and brotherhoods, were also damaged."

                "content": "The number of deaths resulting from this tragedy is not consensual. Some sources point to a number very close to 1000 fatalities. According to Cabral Nascimento, in a lengthy study on these events published in the Historical Archive of Madeira (Volumes 1 and 5), this flood caused more than 700 fatalities, and besides the city, there were also many damages in the other parishes in the South of the Island, namely in Campanário, Calheta, Tabua, Ribeira Brava, Santa Cruz, and especially in Machico, where fourteen people died. The governor and captain general D. José Manuel da Câmara, given the gravity of the events, published an edict adopting the necessary measures to mitigate the effects of the disaster. One of the first measures adopted was, naturally, to seek shelter for the many people who had been left homeless. Temporary accommodation was provided in various public buildings, state service offices, churches, chapels, fortresses, as well as many private houses. Another urgent measure was the prohibition of price increases for consumer goods under penalty of severe punishments for transgressors. Not remaining insensitive to the suffering of the Madeirans, the government of the metropolis, in February 1804, sent to Madeira Brigadier Reinaldo Oudinot with the task of directing the much-needed recovery works. On February 19, 1804, Brigadier Reinaldo Oudinot, a reputed engineering specialist, arrived in Madeira with the mission to oversee the recovery work from the damage caused by the great flood and to guide the construction of the lateral walls of the streams. He demonstrated, from the beginning, high competence in performing his duties. In a short period, he managed to pipe the three streams that cross Funchal. He is also responsible for one of the major planning moments of the city of Funchal, outlining a plan for its reconstruction, which refers to the expansion of the city to the north, east, and west. Also outside of Funchal, he developed laborious activities promoting the widening and strengthening of the walls of the banks of the Machico stream. He promoted the rapid reconstruction of many of the damaged structures in various parts of the island, relying on the free labor of many Madeirans who only received essential goods and exemption from certain taxes, all in accordance with the old \"Ordenações,\" which had been in effect since the beginning of the settlement, to occur in exceptional events. Reinaldo Oudinot would die in the city of Funchal on February 11, 1807, but his services were not forgotten by the inhabitants of this city who named the street on the left bank of the João Gomes stream after him, between Campo da Barca and Praça dos Lavradores."

Shops were inundated with 1 meter of water, and businesses were also paralyzed (sawmills closed and quarries unreachable), leading to much agitation among the people. There were also problems in the areas of Colonnata with the temporary suspension of gas in homes, Forno, and Torano. The maximum rainfall recorded was 140 millimeters over the course of an hour and a half, which was not predicted by weather reports."

In southern Poland, high water levels persisted for 2-3 days, which led to seepage and breaches of the levees on the Vistula. There were also failures of hydraulic structures (including the breach of the dam of the under-construction Wióry reservoir on the Świślin, resulting in flooding of the southern part of Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski). The losses from the flood were estimated at 4 billion zlotys. In Gdańsk, the flood occurred on July 9, 2001. As a result, significant areas of the city were affected, including those along the Radunia Canal in the Orunia-Św. Wojciech-Lipce and Downtown districts, as well as areas along the Strzyża stream in the Wrzeszcz Górny and Wrzeszcz Dolny districts. The intense rainfall also affected, among others, Maków Podhalański, where on July 24, 94.6 mm of rain fell, and on July 25, as much as 190.8 mm. This caused an increase in water levels in rivers and streams, resulting in the destruction of the market, damage to municipal infrastructure, disruption of railway tracks, and damage to numerous homes. According to estimates, the losses related to public property exceeded 20 million zlotys."

Its riverbed was originally mostly flat, kilometers wide, and intertwined. Almost every year, it swelled to multiple times its normal width and repeatedly sought a new bed in its gravel. Corrections to its riverbed from the late Middle Ages to the 19th century were primarily intended to make it navigable, increasing its flow speed, which deepened its bed even more. From Augsburg to its confluence with the Danube, the Lech had been flowing in an artificially regulated bed since the 1850s, but upstream it was still largely in its natural state. In June 1910, there was still a lot of snow in the Tyrolean mountains, which melted rapidly due to heavy rain on June 14. With the influx of both rainfall and meltwater, the Lech swelled into a raging river. In the Tyrolean Lechtal, it swept away seven bridges, and numerous timber rafting structures and barriers fell victim to it. At Steeg, it carried almost 300 cubic meters of water per second—compared to an average of only 12 cubic meters per second. At that time, the Forggensee did not yet exist to absorb the flood peaks. On the evening of June 15, the Lech reached a flow rate of over 1000 cubic meters per second at Landsberg, according to measurements at the time, and over 1400 cubic meters per second by today's estimates, destroying the Karolinenwehr there. In the lowlands of the Lechfeld, it flowed up to four kilometers wide. It reached almost to the edge of the settlement of Mering on the right and into the village of Haunstetten on the left. In Rain, five kilometers before the confluence with the Danube, the entire area north of the old town was flooded, causing significant damage in the so-called suburb (area of Donauwörther Straße). In Oberndorf am Lech, all local streets were underwater. The peak flow at the Lech confluence on June 16, 1910, was measured at 1250 cubic meters per second (average flow 116 cubic meters). Other rivers, such as the Iller, also experienced severe flooding at the same time, causing significant damage."

Subsequently, the water destroyed the main lock of the city stream, the historic main lock building from 1798, and the restoration building. With great efforts, the military and the fire department managed to protect the well structure at the Hochablass, a construction on which Augsburg's drinking water supply completely depended, from destruction by reinforcing the bank with riprap, gravel-filled boxes, sandbags, and other natural materials. To reduce the risk of further damage, the entire Hochablass weir was blown up except for a small remaining stump on the eastern bank. The river tore away extensive stretches of the bank below the weir, where its bed was deeply incised, and destroyed seven properties on the Hochzoller bank. Parts of Hochzoll, Lechhausen, and the Jakobervorstadt were flooded. The tracks of line I of the Augsburg local railway were undermined and damaged. The 52-meter-high church tower of St. Pankratius in Lechhausen was severely damaged. The railway weir broke, putting the railway bridge at Hochzoll in great danger, as its middle pillar was threatened to be undermined. In Gersthofen, a large piece of the railway bridge, which was only seven years old, was torn away."

Following the flood disaster, Augsburg faced great hardship due to a lack of water, as the break of the high discharge weir caused the capital stream, which was fed by it, and the Lech canals supplying Augsburg to run dry. All hydropower plants on these canals were shut down. Large companies switched to coal-powered steam engines, while many small businesses completely ceased operations. Since all the city's wastewater also flowed through these canals, their drying up also endangered the health of the population. However, a short-term reconstruction of the high discharge weir was out of the question. Therefore, a new temporary Lech diversion was established further upstream to supply the capital stream with water again."

In 1914, King Ludwig III visited the completed new spillway with the royal family, which is still commemorated today by a monument on the left bank of the weir."

On the 16th, the tributaries of the Yodo River on the right bank, including the Hino River (Takatsuki City), the Akuta River (Takatsuki City), the Aii River (Ibaraki City), and the Ibaraki River (Ibaraki City), flooded. On the 17th, the embankment of the Amano River in Okashinmachi, Hirakata City, on the left bank of the Yodo River, collapsed, and later that night, the embankment of the main Yodo River in Ikaga, Hirakata City, collapsed over a stretch of 30 ken (about 182m), leading to the \"Ikaga Break,\" which eventually expanded to 60 ken (about 364m) and overflowed to the south side of the Yodo River. The embankments on the left bank of the Yodo River collapsed in various places, and in addition, the waters from the tributaries and irrigation channels of the Yodo River overflowed, flooding the entire northern area of the Kawachi Plain. The water reached the embankment of the Neyagawa River and stopped there, with no damage occurring south of the Neyagawa River. Nevertheless, on the 20th, the Onchi River flooded in Nakakawachi County. The flooded areas extended over a wide range, including the current Osaka City districts of Miyakojima, Asahi, Joto, Tsurumi, as well as Moriguchi City, Kadoma City, Neyagawa City, Hirakata City, Settsu City, Ibaraki City, and Takatsuki City. With the momentum of the flood temporarily halted, Governor Kenno Sato of Osaka Prefecture decided to intentionally breach the embankment of the Okawa River to drain the vast amount of water, employing a method known as \"waza to kiru,\" which had been used repeatedly since the Edo period. From the 20th to the 23rd, he cut 26 ken of the left bank embankment of the Okawa River behind Daichoji Temple (now Fujita Tei Ato Park) located at the confluence of the Okawa and Neyagawa rivers in the southwestern corner of the flooded area. Restoration of the embankment began on the 25th in Ikaga, Hirakata City, and on the 28th, Minister of Finance Matsukata Masayoshi inspected the construction work."

                "content": "On the night of the 27th, when the drainage of the flooded areas had not yet been completed, a thunderstorm began, and on the 28th, heavy rain fell due to the influence of a typhoon. The wind intensified on the 29th, and on July 1st, a storm occurred, causing the embankment in Ikaga, which was under repair, to collapse again, leading to the waters of the Yodo River overflowing to the south once more. Furthermore, the embankment in Sakuramiya, in the current Miyakojima Ward, also collapsed in three places, and water from the Okawa River entered from the embankment behind Daichoji, which had been intentionally cut. This flood did not stop there; the embankment of the Neyagawa River, which had prevented greater damage during the previous flood, collapsed at Tokuan in the current Tsurumi Ward, and as a result, other rivers flowing into the Neyagawa also overflowed, causing the flood to expand south of the Neyagawa. By early July, a large lake, which should have disappeared due to land reclamation in the Edo period, appeared on the surface, including Shinjo Pond and Fukano Pond, which were once part of the Kawachi Lake. Additionally, the high tide contributed to the water from Osaka Bay flowing up the Anjigawa River, flooding the current Kita Ward and Nishi Ward areas, but the area around Osaka Tenmangu Shrine was spared from flooding due to its slightly elevated terrain. The July flood caused the flooded areas from June to be inundated again, and new areas including the current Kita Ward, Fukushima Ward, Konohana Ward, Nishi Ward, Minato Ward, Higashinari Ward, Ikuno Ward, Higashi-Osaka City, Daito City, and Shijonawate City were also flooded. The area affected by flooding was approximately 15,269 cho (15,142 ha), with about 20% of the total households in Osaka Prefecture at that time, or 72,509 households, being flooded by up to about 4 meters. Additionally, 1,749 houses were lost, about 15,000 were damaged, 512 bridges were washed away, 224 embankments collapsed, and there were 81 dead or missing, with 304,199 people affected, resulting in significant damage. The loss of houses was 739 in Ibaraki County and 836 in Higashinari County, accounting for 90% of the total, while the dead and missing numbered 49 in Ibaraki County and 13 in Higashinari County, making up 77% of the total, causing substantial damage. However, in terms of the number of flooded houses, Nishi Ward had 23,116, Naniwa County had 14,253, and Kita Ward had 8,691, surpassing Ibaraki County's 6,996 and Higashinari County's 4,421, mainly due to the storm surge caused by the typhoon. Ultimately, excluding the area north of the Yodo River, which suffered less damage, most low-lying areas, including around Osaka Tenmangu Shrine, the area between Osaka Castle and Tennoji on the Uemachi Plateau, and around Senba, were affected by flooding, while the southern part of Osaka City was also inundated. In addition to Kawasaki Bridge upstream of the Okawa, the three major bridges of Naniwa, namely Tenmabashi, Tenjinbashi, and the southern half of Namba Bridge (the northern half is a railway bridge), as well as Yodoyabashi, were also washed away. The Aji River Bridge, which was the latest movable iron bridge, showed signs of being blocked by debris, prompting the army to quickly blow it up. Thus, more than 30 of the main bridges in Osaka, known as the \"Yao Yao Hashi,\" were washed away one after another, cutting off almost all transportation in the city. On the 7th, the army installed a boat bridge south of Namba Bridge. Once the storm subsided, the flood finally ceased its movement. As the water level of the Yodo River gradually decreased, the water that had accumulated in the flooded areas was drained from the repaired embankments, particularly from the embankment behind Daichoji, although it took a long time. After this flood, the nearby counties initiated a movement to petition the Osaka Prefecture and the national government for the improvement of the Yodo River, and eventually, the Osaka Prefectural Assembly submitted a proposal to the national government. These movements, led by Obashi Bontaro, bore fruit, and finally, in 1896 (Meiji 29), after the First Sino-Japanese War, a public river law bill that included the improvement of the Yodo River was enacted, and the budget for the Yodo River improvement was established, leading to the commencement of improvement works from that year. The Daichoji Temple, which had been washed away and whose grounds had become desolate, was sold around 1887 (Meiji 20) to Fujita Densaburo, and the temple was relocated and restored. On the site where Daichoji once stood, Densaburo built a residence called Anjima Goten, which is now the Fujita Museum, Fujita Residence Ruins Park, Taikoen, and Osaka City Public Hall. Near Sakuranomiya Park, a monument related to this flood has been erected."

                "content": "The Flood of Deucalion is the ancient Greek version of the flood mentioned in the traditions of many ancient cultures. According to the myth, during the time when Deucalion ruled in Phthia in Thessaly, Zeus decided to destroy all of humanity, which was corrupt, except for the righteous king and his wife Pyrrha. Therefore, Deucalion, after advice from his father, built a ship, gathered the necessary supplies for their survival, and boarded the vessel with his wife. Meanwhile, Zeus opened the floodgates of Heaven, and the land of Greece was filled with water, and people perished. For nine days and nine nights, the royal couple drifted on the waters in the vessel. \n\nOn the tenth day, however, they landed on Mount Othrys, or according to another version, on Parnassus or Athos. There, when the rains stopped and the waters receded, Deucalion and Pyrrha descended to dry land, and the first thing they did was to make a sacrifice to Zeus the Protector of Refugees. The god whom the pious Deucalion invoked sent Hermes to convey to them the promise that Zeus would grant their first wish. And the first wish of Deucalion and Pyrrha was none other than for Zeus to give life again to the human race. According to another version, which comes from Phocis, Deucalion and Pyrrha went to Delphi and to the sanctuary of Themis to express the same desire. The goddess listened to them and responded with an oracle, telling them that if they wanted to bring new people to life, they should cover their faces and throw the bones of their mother behind their backs. They understood the interpretation of the oracle, and after doing what the oracle told them, they began to throw stones behind their backs, as these came from the womb of Mother Earth. The stones that Deucalion threw transformed into men, and those that Pyrrha threw transformed into women. From the first stone that Deucalion threw, the Greek, the ancestor of the Greeks, came forth. \n\nThere are other variations of the flood of Deucalion, such as that it occurred when Ogyges was king in Boeotia, the first king of the land of the Boeotians, or according to the Megarians, only Megara was saved from the flood, who took refuge at the top of the Gerania mountains. Nevertheless, the version of Deucalion and Pyrrha is the one that spread widely and prevailed over all others, and during the time of Plutarch, it was enriched with other elements and details that come from Asian traditions, reminding in many ways of the version told in the Bible."

With the stabilization of weather conditions in the flood-affected areas, the city witnessed a strong reaction of spontaneous social solidarity, with participation from the population, including many young people and kids, who took part in helping and assisting those affected and restoring normalcy. In the following days, many volunteers, referred to as \"mud angels\" (a term historically used by Italian media to describe volunteers who intervene in flooded areas), including people of all ages, Genoese citizens, flood victims, immigrants, people who came from other parts of Italy, civil protection workers, firefighters, and municipal employees, cleaned the streets and most of the affected structures."

A weather event of large proportions, aggravated by the strong self-regenerating thunderstorm. The meeting of the two flows, that of warm air with that of cold air, is the cause of the V-shape thunderstorm, so named in English for its V shape, and also referred to as self-regenerating. From the examination of wind data, the southwesterlies at altitudes above 700 hPa and the southerlies at 850 hPa in the lower layers (925 and 1000 hPa), it can be understood how the meeting between the cold northern currents of the Tramontana wind from the Po Valley and the warm humid southern currents of the Scirocco wind from the Tyrrhenian Sea led to the occurrence of a stationary microfront, that is, a stall due to the airflow caused by the convective motion of the currents. The currents remained blocked over the area, consequently the thunderstorm precipitation self-fed and fell back on the same area."

Prior flood control measures, as seen in the Nakajo levee, were based on the premise of flooding and only protected key points, and although the area had frequently been hit by floods, starting with the Edo flood in 1742, it was not seen as a problem. However, after the Meiji Restoration, as modern infrastructure development progressed and the damage amounts increased, further burdens were placed on areas suffering from flooding, making it difficult to gain understanding for flood control based on the premise of flooding."

In Gunma Prefecture, which suffered the most damage, there were 283 dead, 27 missing, and 1,249 houses completely destroyed or washed away. In addition to the left bank of the Tone River and downstream areas, the Nakajo levee, a key flood control structure on the right bank, which had been reinforced after the major eruption of Mount Asama in 1783, also broke, causing floodwaters to traverse Saitama Prefecture and reach Tokyo, completely inundating the Kanto Plain. In Tokyo, the downtown area was submerged for a while, and there are records of a relief station (now Asakusa Temple Hospital) being established at Senso-ji Temple."

One side, including the northern Katsushika district and the southern and northern Saitama districts, advocated for reinforced restoration, while the other side, the Kamigō area, demanded the conventional maintenance of the Nakajo Dam along with the construction of levees on the upper Tone River. This led to great chaos in the prefectural assembly, and local residents, dissatisfied with the mediation proposal presented by the governor, clashed violently with police forces, resulting in repeated conflicts in the prefectural assembly. Ultimately, however, consideration was given to the demands of the Kamigō area, which had been suffering from water damage, and the height of the Nakajo Dam was maintained as before. In response to the claims from the Shimogō area for reinforcement, it was decided to widen the levee, and the narrow sections at Sakamaki and Setoi were to be expanded, with the restoration based on a continuous levee system. This necessitated a revision of the ongoing Tone River improvement project, leading to significant changes such as a review of the planned flood flow and an increase in the diversion flow to the Edogawa River. Additionally, this major flood caused significant damage in Tokyo, affecting 1.5 million victims, and the Tokyo Prefecture, which had not previously borne the costs of flood control for the Tone River, began to share the local burden of flood control costs like other prefectures in the basin. For the Arakawa River, a large-scale improvement plan was formulated, and the following year, the Arakawa River diversion project was initiated, which involved the excavation of a discharge channel 500 meters wide and 22 kilometers long from Iwabuchi to the mouth of the Nakagawa River. The project faced significant challenges due to the recession caused by World War I and the Great Kanto Earthquake, but utilizing steam excavators and dredging boats, a total of 3.1 million personnel were mobilized, and it was completed in Showa 5 (1930)."

The affected areas were Andorra and the regions through which the Segre River flows, from Lleida to Cerdanya, and it also caused damage in the basins of the Noguera and the Llobregat. It was particularly tragic in Alt Urgell and Baixa Cerdanya. The floods left 14 fatalities, cut-off roads, and collapsed bridges. Additionally, they resulted in a significant economic crisis. The observatory in La Molina reported figures of 600 liters per m², while in Seu d'Urgell it was 102 liters per m². In Alt Urgell, there were forty isolated villages and thirty collapsed bridges. Neither the newspapers in Barcelona nor the television reflected the magnitude of the disaster, as they were focused on covering the trip of Pope John Paul II. The airport in Seu d'Urgell became the link between the city, the region, and Andorra with the outside world. The airport recorded up to 146 flights between planes and helicopters. In Baixa Cerdanya, the flood swept away the road from La Molina as it passed through Alp. In Martinet, it destroyed five or six houses. In Alt Urgell, the flood left the city of Seu d'Urgell cut off, and the bridges crossing the Valira and the Palanca bridge collapsed. The village that suffered the most damage was Pont de Bar, built in a narrow area close to the Segre, which was completely submerged by the floods, forcing its reconstruction far from the old village. Half of the village was buried by a landslide from a mountain, and the water also destroyed several houses; it also swept away the remains of the millennial bridge of Sant Ermengol, which gives its name to the village. Years later, the river was channeled as it passed through the Segre River. In 2007, 25 years later, a plaque was placed in memory of the victims at the entrance of the Olympic Park of the Segre, at the steps of the tannery. The plaque reads \"Such a great flood of water came...\"."

At the Pont de Bar (now Pont de Bar Vell), they boarded up the doors of the power station, and at night the water level suddenly rose by two meters and swept away the workers' house, which was unoccupied at that moment. In the evening, given the magnitude of the rise, the Emergency Board was established, coordinated by the City Council of La Seu d'Urgell and other organizations. On November 8, in the early morning, the Adrall bridge on the Cantó road collapsed, and at a quarter to two, it was reported that the Oliana reservoir was full. Between La Seu d'Urgell and Alàs, the usual width of the Segre is 30 meters; that day it was 400 meters and exceeded its normal level by five meters, and in Organyà by fourteen. Five people had been isolated since Sunday (the 7th) in a farm in Montferrer and had to climb onto the roof as the river was eroding the house. The Civil Guard helicopter that was supposed to come from Zaragoza did not arrive, but they were eventually rescued, along with one person in Salit, by a second French helicopter mobilized through efforts by the Mitra in Andorra. A fire department boat rescued a girl stuck in a tree in Ponts, and the French helicopter went to La Massana due to reports of gas explosions and that some cars had fallen into the Valira while fleeing danger. During Monday, information was gathered about the closed roads, the isolated towns, and the provision of essential services to the cut-off villages. In the evening, false rumors began to circulate about the collapse of a dam in France, and in Oliana, the evacuation of the lower part of the town was ordered. On the 9th, efforts were made to secure raw materials, and an air bridge was established between the La Seu d'Urgell airport and Barcelona. Among other things, there was the evacuation of the sick and the arrival of medicines and food. A total of 10 helicopters were operational, with three soldiers with radio telephones in each telephonically isolated village. To reach Andorra, alternative routes through the high mountains had to be used, and SAR helicopters evacuated tourists. In Alt Urgell, it was ensured that the milk from the isolated villages could reach the tanker trucks. Some of the procedures were deemed picturesque, such as the hose from Taús, to lower the milk down the ravine. On Wednesday, rumors circulated about a landslide at the Pont de Bar, saying that if the landslide occurred, it would create a dam that would multiply the effects of the previous floods. As a consequence, the mountain was studied day and night by geologists. On the 11th, Os de Civís, Taús, Tuixent, and Ossera were still cut off. In Os, a group of forty soldiers cleared a path with picks and shovels. Complaints about the lack of television and political coverage were significant, although that same day, Jordi Pujol, then president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, visited La Seu d'Urgell. On Friday, a decree was published denying the information from TVE about the danger of a landslide at the Pont de Bar. The rumors had caused alarm downstream and even reached Lleida. In Balaguer, scenes of panic were experienced, and an evacuation order was given. The area was declared a disaster zone by means of a decree law 21/1982. Ultimately, the total number of victims was twelve people, although it had been said that there were about fifty in Andorra."

An evacuation order was immediately issued for all buildings within 500 meters of the gas station. The country took a week to return to normal. Days after the events, there were still 1800 tourists trapped in hotels awaiting rescue. The disaster caused the population to flock to insurance companies after the floods. Policies multiplied, and so did the insurance claims. The first government of the country, which was in the midst of transitioning to a Constitution, had to improvise. The head of government, Òscar Ribas, was caught off guard by the tragedy. While it was pouring rain in Andorra, he was in Geneva on an official trip. He was immediately informed of the chaos. It was the first time Andorra had a government and faced such disasters. Poor planning in previous years regarding construction was one of the causes of the floods' severity.

Some shopping centers offered products that had suffered from the water damage at reduced prices for a long time. The situation generated by the floods raised alarms for thefts. There were people who took advantage of the situation, and at one point, bottles of water were sold for more than double the normal price. Central Park (Andorra la Vella) was flooded. The situation was one of hysteria and anguish, as confirmed by Jaume Bartumeu (former head of government). According to estimates from the government at the time, the reconstruction of the damages and destruction cost more than 1000 million pesetas. Andorran schools, especially the Liceu Comte de Foix, took a long time to return to normal. The country observed several days of mourning."

The affected areas were Andorra and the regions through which the Segre River flows, from Lleida to Cerdanya, and it also caused damage in the basins of the Noguera and the Llobregat. It was particularly tragic in Alt Urgell and Baixa Cerdanya. The floods left 14 fatalities, cut-off roads, and collapsed bridges. Additionally, they resulted in a significant economic crisis. The observatory in La Molina reported figures of 600 liters per m², while in La Seu d'Urgell it was 102 liters per m². In Alt Urgell, there were forty isolated villages and thirty collapsed bridges. Neither the newspapers in Barcelona nor the television reflected the magnitude of the disaster, being focused on the coverage of Pope John Paul II's trip. The airport in La Seu d'Urgell became the link for the city, the region, and Andorra with the outside world. The airport recorded up to 146 flights between planes and helicopters.

The flooding from the Kaji River combined with the overflow from Fukushima Lagoon, leading to prolonged inundation of the nearby low-lying areas. The drainage at the Arai-gō River pumping station could not keep up, so the levee of the Agano River was breached for drainage, and on August 4, drainage was completed after 19 days. The flooding on the right bank of the Kaji River flowed towards the Otogawa River and caused inundation at the site of the Shiunji Lagoon. The following year, on August 28, 1967, the Uetsu Flood (8/28 Flood, Uetsu Heavy Rain) occurred in the Shimoekawa region and Yamagata Prefecture.

On the other hand, the climate in Santa Fe is temperate without a dry season, according to the Köppen climate classification, with annual precipitation between 800 and 1100 mm, of which approximately half occurs between the months of February and May. These land and climate characteristics, along with the occupation of floodable soils, result in the continuous risk and water vulnerability that the city suffers."

                "content": "In light of the problems faced with the water situation, the government has built a series of defenses to prevent floods and inundations. The first and most primitive of these is the defense embankment or lateral dike, which is an artificial barrier of earth located on the banks, separating rivers from flood-prone areas. To prevent water accumulation, as it cannot flow back into the rivers due to the embankments, a set of river defense structures was established, consisting of storm drains, pipes, and rainwater drains. This system directs water to reservoirs, areas adjacent to the embankments, which are depressed zones whose main function is to temporarily store water to later be emptied into nearby natural water flows. This emptying occurs in two ways, namely by gravity and by pumping. The gravity method occurs through gates in the embankments that connect the reservoirs at their lowest point with a part at the height of a water flow. On the other hand, the pumping system operates through plants equipped with motor pumps capable of expelling water outside the defenses. By 2007, there were four pumping stations, known as pump houses, in operation, with two more lacking electrical connections. Pump house No. 1 was operating at 65% of its capacity, with two of the five pumps not working; No. 3 operated at 65% and No. 4 at 80%. In pump house No. 2, an explosion occurred on March 14 in one of the two pumps, which had not yet been repaired at the time the flooding began. By then, 27 of the 45 available pumps were not functioning, representing 60% of the pumping system."

                "content": "On April 20, 2005, the Justicialist mayor Martín Balbarrey, elected in 2003, presented the Contingency Plan for the city, which detailed all the mechanisms to prevent crisis situations like the 2003 flood, with the aim of ensuring that each neighbor knew how to act in an emergency. The plan was prepared by official agencies and NGOs, along with community groups and specialists in the field, and was led by Venezuelan Pedro Zuccarini, a disaster specialist who had been helping in the city since the 2003 flood, on behalf of the German Red Cross. The plan established the action protocols to be carried out by organizations and institutions, the dissemination of necessary knowledge to the population so they would know how to react, and the creation of the Risk Action Office, prepared to act before, during, and after the disaster. A year later, on March 20, 2006, Balbarrey ordered the creation of the Undersecretariat for Risk Management, dependent on the Secretariat of Water Resources, which he placed Pedro Zuccarini in charge of. In June 2006, Proyecto Santa Fe, a study center led by then-national deputy radical Hugo Storero, conducted a survey of 360 people and 56 institutions from twelve neighborhoods in the west, the area most affected by the 2003 flood. Given the results, it turned out that most did not know what to do in the event of a new flood, being unaware of the new Contingency Plan and the location of evacuation centers, although Zuccarini later denied the survey, claiming that \"two out of five Santa Fe residents\" knew the plan and were prepared. Another finding from the survey was that a majority of institutions did not believe another flood was possible. Zuccarini traveled to his home country, Venezuela, in December 2006, first for personal reasons, and then, according to Balbarrey, to present the projects established in Santa Fe in other parts of the world. On February 1, 2007, he continued to be absent, resulting in him being unpaid, and he was ultimately removed from his position on February 21. The team of nine people from the undersecretariat continued working, divided into two groups, one responsible for fieldwork and the other for logistics. This occurred in the context of the rise of the Paraná River in February 2007, which affected the residents of Vuelta del Paraguayo."

The flood was not as devastating as the Great Flood of 1789, but water levels were higher or close to that in many places. According to the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE), the flood had a volume 3-4 times that of the Great Flood in parts of the Glomma river. At least twelve people are reported to have lost their lives. The flood may have been at the level of a 500-year flood. It was caused by an unusually high amount of snow in the mountains during the winter of 1859/1860. When the snowmelt was at its worst, large amounts of rain also fell, leading to extreme flooding and significant inundation in many areas of Eastern Norway. In this way, it resembled the Lesser Flood of 1995, while the Great Flood was more of a rain flood. Buskerud was particularly hard hit, resulting in loss of life, along with livestock and bridges. Parts of Sweden also experienced significant flooding. The Faluån river destroyed a large part of the buildings along its banks, and the water level in Siljan rose to 3 meters above normal."

                "content": "Starting from September 8, 1899, there were heavy rainfalls in Southern Bavaria. The rain originated from a large low-pressure area that extended from North Africa to the Baltic Sea and from the Western Alps to the Black Sea. The transport of moist air from the north and from the entire Mediterranean region produced precipitation peaking over 500 mm over an area of more than 10,000 square kilometers. In the Isar region up to the mouth of the Loisach, the rainfall from September 9 to 14 averaged 400 mm, resulting in 990 million cubic meters of runoff from the 2736 square kilometer area. Due to a relatively dry summer and a snow-poor winter of 1898/99, the underground reservoirs had a low water level, allowing parts of the rainwater to be naturally captured. Otherwise, the subsequent flooding would have been even more massive. Nevertheless, the rainfalls led to flooding, especially in the Isar and Inn regions, by September 14. Other areas in the foothills of the Alps were similarly affected, such as along the Danube and the Traun. Unlike the floods of 1954 and 2002, there was no double wave (resulting from separately fallen blocks of precipitation) in 1899, but only a continuous, single wave. The water levels reached in 1899 were the highest ever recorded in the Isar and Inn regions."

Here, as in the Isar meadows, constructed ponds and lakes were destroyed. The hydropower plant Maximilianswerk, built only in 1895, was also affected. All Isar bridges were damaged, with two collapsing. In addition to three wooden bridges, there were eight stone and two iron bridges in the city area before the flood. On September 13, the Max-Joseph Bridge (also known as the Bogenhauser Bridge), a bridge built in 1876 in iron framework architecture, collapsed. The date is notable as it was also on a September 13 during the flood of 1813 that the Munich Swan Bridge (now: Ludwigsbrücke) collapsed at the current Museum Island, drowning 100 people. After days of the flood undermining the pillars of the Luitpold Bridge (also known as the Prinzregenten Bridge) and washing away significant amounts of soil at the abutments as well as parts of the bank protections, it too collapsed into the Isar the following day. This steel bridge, built in segmental arch construction, had only been erected eight years earlier. Approximately at its location, the riverbed of the Isar widened during the flood due to bank erosion from 45 to 65 meters. No fatalities from the flood are known."

The destroyed Max-Joseph Bridge was replaced by a temporary bridge after the onset of winter. As a result of the destruction, the city administration decided on an extensive construction and renovation program, which from 1900 to 1905 included a fundamental river regulation in the urban area, the construction of extensive riverbanks and quay walls, as well as the renewal (profile expansion for greater water flow) or new construction of six bridges. In March 1901, the city magistrate decided to announce a limited competition for the expansion and new construction of the bridges. The generous new construction program included the creation of six new Isar bridges in stone and (partially) concrete construction (Luitpold Bridge – 1901, Max-Joseph Bridge – 1902, Cornelius Bridge – 1903, Reichenbach Bridge – 1903, Wittelsbacher Bridge – 1904, and Outer Maximilian Bridge – 1905) and a reorganization of the Isar area (almost continuously over a length of about 6 kilometers from the Thalkirchen weirs to the Praterwehr) with regulation by encasing the river with quay walls and dikes. For cost reasons, the new bridges were constructed with a standard teaching framework and made of solid shell limestone (from quarries in Lower Franconia), which is why they look similar in shape with their wide-spanning arches and are the same in material. The bridges were built by the construction company Sager & Woerner, and the designs were by architects Friedrich von Thiersch and Theodor Fischer. The previously regularly flooded coal island (now: Museum Island) was also reinforced so that it was now flood-proof."

The most affected areas were Baix Llobregat, Empordà, and Penedès. The highest precipitation levels occurred on the 28th in Baix Llobregat with 262.0 mm in St. Feliu del Llobregat and 153.8 mm in Esplugues de Llobregat, and in Alt Penedès with 105.5 mm at the Foix Reservoir. On the 29th, the maximum values were recorded in Baix Empordà with 192.3 mm in Lladó, 181.0 mm in Peralada, and 150.6 mm in Empúries. Throughout the meteorological episode, the 262.0 mm in St. Feliu de Llobregat and the 202.6 mm in Lladó stand out. During those days, there was a marked surface flow between east and southeast, driven by a deep depression located over Galicia, which had a secondary core off the coast of Algeria. Additionally, at altitude, there was significant wind shear: southwest at 500 hPa, south at 850 hPa, and southeast at the surface. In general, this configuration tends to be potentially very unstable and leads to the advection of warm and very humid air to Catalonia, favoring the development of significant storms with heavy rains along the coast and pre-coast, as occurred between September 28 and 29, 1913. Due to the large amount of precipitation, the Foix, Anoia, Cardener, Llobregat, Ripoll, Congost, Besòs, Muga, Manol, Llobregat d'Empordà, and numerous streams in Penedès, Garraf, Baix Llobregat, Barcelonès, and Empordà overflowed, causing significant damage in many places. Regarding the damage, it is worth highlighting the violent overflow of the Riera de la Salut in St. Feliu de Llobregat, which broke the walls of the municipal cemetery, dragging many coffins into the Llobregat River. In Vendrell, the Torrent del Lluc swept away the railway bridge, and in Cubelles, the Foix destroyed another bridge. Finally, in Empordà, all the bridges on the road from Roses to Vilajuïga collapsed due to the significant overflow of the various streams crossing that road. The consequences of this flood were very visible for a long time, leaving a significant mark in the memory of the inhabitants of all the affected regions."

At the narrow of la Riba, where the courses of the Brugent and Francolí rivers meet, the flood demolished numerous houses and paper mills and caused fatalities. The streams flowing near the city of Valls also experienced rises, causing the collapse of walls and some houses. Two people were reported missing. In the Valls area, the rise of the Francolí respected the Goi bridge, a construction from the medieval period. In the following days, in the areas of Rourell, Morell, Pobla de Mafumet, and Puigdelfí, numerous corpses were collected that the water had dragged away. In Tarragona, it was the eve of the Santa Tecla Major Festival. It rained torrentially from one to six in the morning. Around two-thirty in the night, the Francolí River overflowed, flooding the nearby fields and collapsing an old wooden bridge and the iron bridges of the two railway lines (the one from Reus and Lleida, and the one from Tortosa and Valencia). The water entered the city and flooded the lower neighborhoods, causing severe damage. In the following days, numerous corpses were found that the flood had dragged to the beaches and the gardens by the Francolí. The Gaià River also experienced a strong rise. In the upper course, the flood demolished numerous houses in Pontils and those in the lower part of Santa Perpètua. The rise caused considerable damage along its entire course, provoking a severe flood in the area of Altafulla where it collapsed the railway bridge. In Baix Camp, the streams also overflowed, demolishing buildings in towns like Reus, Riudoms, Cambrils, and Mont-roig. On the beaches between Hospitalet de l'Infant and Cambrils, seventeen corpses were collected, and forty more between Cambrils and Salou."

The flooding occurred in the early morning, surprising people inside their homes. Inside the town, the water rose in the streets until it reached the square of Sant Antoni. In the rest of Urgell, the Corb river also experienced a strong rise, causing devastation as it passed through Guimerà (35 deaths). In Tarròs, the water demolished almost all the houses, causing 8 deaths. In Vilagrassa, there were 13 fatalities and in Claravalls, 11. The heavy rain also swept away a section of the railway line between Tàrrega and Bellpuig and the bridge over the Vilagrassa stream. Between Bellpuig and Belianes, a small settlement, the Eixaders, also disappeared. Near Agramunt, the Sió river carried away the aqueduct bridge, built in 1857, over which the Urgell canal crossed elevated above the river. The waters, which swept away all kinds of objects, blocked the arches, causing the river level to exceed 9 meters, the water passed over the bridge and formed a great waterfall until the structure gave way.

In the afternoon, the heavy rains intensified in the regions of Montsià and Baix Ebre, in the south of the province. The heavy rains and the increase in river flow put the entire province on Alert G - very heavy rains. The most affected areas were the banks of the Francolí River, from its source in Espluga de Francolí to its mouth, next to the fishing district of Tarragona - the Serrallo. In some places, the river reached heights of up to three meters, surpassing the height of some of the bridges crossing it and causing the collapse of five, for example, in the town of La Riba, the confluence of the Francolí and Brugent rivers caused a flood that destroyed the access bridge to the town. The PLASEQTA - Safety Plan for the chemical industry of Tarragona - was also activated due to the collapse of the bridge that provided access to the refinery and the municipalities of Pobla de Mafumet and Morell via the Valls road. The force of the river caused the breakage of two conduits of the rack that transports various chemical substances, resulting in these toxic products spilling into the sea. In Reus, the PEM - Municipal Emergency Plan - was activated early in the morning, as most communication routes were cut off. Some flooding occurred - at the Casal de Sant Josep Obrer and Hall 4 of the Fair - students from the Bon Soleil School (currently Collège Français de Reus) were evacuated, and two houses collapsed, but no personal injuries were reported. The water flowed with great force through all the streams, torrents, and ravines of many towns in Tarragona, however, the water flowing through the streams of Alforja and Maspujols caused the majority of the damage in Baix Camp. In Priorat, the need to open the sluices of the Siurana reservoir increased the river flow and caused severe flooding in Porrera, which had to be partially evacuated. Power supply interruptions occurred - eight high-voltage towers fell in various municipalities - as well as telephone, gas, train, and road lines. The most significant evacuations took place in the fishing district of the city of Tarragona - the Serrallo - and in Porrera and Poboleda - in the Priorat region. Other municipalities were cut off due to the floods. Throughout the day, according to information from the delegate of the Government of the Generalitat, Josep Maldonado, and the civil governor, Ramón Sánchez, a total of 850 civil guards, 200 national police, 12 civil protection members, 80 mossos d'esquadra, 160 firefighters, as well as 4 firefighting helicopters were deployed to assist in evacuation tasks, along with local police forces from the affected municipalities and road personnel. The damage caused by the flood to the roads and bridges of the Generalitat was estimated at 5 billion pesetas, to which the autonomous administration added 2 billion in damages to hydraulic works. The MOPTMA estimated the losses in roads and bridges under its jurisdiction at 1.598 billion, mostly in the province of Tarragona, along with the loss of construction machinery from the Tarragona park, valued at 325 million. The Tarragona Provincial Council, for its part, estimated the damages recorded on the local road network at 1 billion pesetas."

The spatial distribution of the rain that morning was very irregular; for example, 217.3 mm fell in Hospitalet, 56 mm in Cornellà, and only 16 mm at the mouth of the Besòs. Precipitation continued to fall more moderately for the rest of the day on the 7th and much of the 8th. The last showers, of a more local nature, extended until midday on November 9. The maximum precipitation values in 24 hours occurred on the 7th, exceeding 200 mm in parts of Vallès Occidental and Barcelonès. In Terrassa, 313.0 mm fell, and in Hospitalet de Llobregat, 249.1 mm over about 28 hours (from 03 UTC on 07/11/1983 to 07 UTC on 08/11/1983). Among the accumulated values during the episode (from 07 UTC on 06/11/1983 to 07 UTC on 09/11/1983), notable amounts include 333.0 mm in Terrassa, 254.8 mm in La Molina, and 252.8 mm in Hospitalet de Llobregat. The meteorological situation during the episode was characterized by a strong surface storm from the southeast, caused by the passage of a deep disturbance present at all levels of the troposphere. This depression moved from the Gulf of Cádiz on the morning of November 6 to Sardinia on the morning of the 8th, crossing the Balearic Islands from the south during the day on the 7th. This storm caused a marked flow of warm, humid wind from the southeast at lower levels and from the south at higher levels, advecting a potentially very unstable air mass at all levels, producing the significant downpours on November 7 and 8."

It is also worth noting that many streets in the city of Barcelona turned into torrents of water due to the heavy intensity of the precipitation, flooding basements and garages. This episode of torrential rains had a significant social impact, especially in the riverside towns of Baix Llobregat, occurring just a year after the major floods caused by the rains from November 6 to 8, 1982, the damages of which had recently been repaired, but with many improvement works still pending. All of this created a notable feeling of helplessness among the entire population."

The old town of Cambrils and some streets near the stream were flooded, such as Carrer Immolats del Setge, Carrer Hospital, and Carrer Sant Plàcid. The Eixample area was also partially flooded, especially the streets Santa Joaquima de Vedruna and Àngel Guimerà. In the port area, Rambla Jaume I and all the streets leading to the port up to Plaza Aragó were also flooded. At half past eleven in the morning, the water level began to drop.

A lot of rubble was floating in the sea, both inside and outside the port. The amount of sediment carried by the flood formed a small delta at its mouth. Likewise, the stream's bed suffered numerous damages: two collapsed bridges, burst walls, rows of trees swallowed, and sunken sidewalks. The Maspujols stream also widened and caused a partial collapse at the bridge on the road leading to Salou and the destruction of part of the facilities at the Cambrils-beach campsite. In the afternoon, the city council convened an extraordinary meeting in which various alert measures were established in case another eventuality occurred, and it was decided, among other measures, to request the designation of a disaster area for Cambrils. The initial assessment of the damages was estimated at 500 million pesetas, as in addition to the destruction of part of the stream's channel and the bridges crossing it, there were damages to the road network, electrical installations, drinking water conduits, and sewage systems. The stream's channel had to be completely rebuilt, and it was taken as an opportunity to improve the foundation of the retaining walls of the last stretch and to cement the last stretch of the bed to prevent erosion."

As a result, a new outlet of the lagoon was opened, known since then as s'Oberta, which led to the project for the drainage of s'Albufera, after decades of proposals, finally being carried out. At the time, it was estimated that 100 million m³ of water accumulated over s'Albufera, and at the Son Amer estate, the water level reached 20 spans (4 meters) above the ground, 6 above sea level. The characteristics of the episode correspond to a combination of torrential floods from the headwaters, extreme rains over the affected area, and marine phenomena, similar to those caused by a cyclonic swell, all exacerbated by an insufficient outlet of s'Albufera."

Around the village, near the Muro road, there was up to a meter of water (up to the belly of the livestock, according to witnesses). Simultaneously, there was a strong storm at sea from the east or southeast and the sea was very high, which prevented the accumulated water and the water flowing from the torrents of Sant Miquel and Muro from flowing out through the natural outlet of s'Albufera, at the Bridges. Eventually, the enormous amount of water, trapped between s'Albufera and sa Pobla, opened a breach in the dune bar 200 paces long and 5 fathoms deep (~260×~4 m.), at the same place where the Canal Gran currently flows into more than three kilometers from the previous point, which allowed the accumulated water to drain. The flooding did not cause human casualties, but a lot of livestock, especially bulls and mares, died. The effects were felt as far as Ciutadella, where the red water (aigua roja) from the great flood arrived. The irrigation ditches, which often served as boundaries between properties, were filled with mud, and it was not possible to identify the limits of rural properties until several days later."

Gelat and his cousin Pere Serra, alias Garrut, both professional fishermen, were sent at midnight on the thirtieth to retrieve the mares that were grazing in s'Albufera, by their owners. When they returned, at the marsh of Son Fornari, the flood did not allow them to continue, and to save themselves, they climbed onto a raft made of 1200 bundles of reeds that they found in the Garden of the Walnut Trees. Up there, they spent 30 hours, much of it standing, with the water up to their chests and tied to each other with the halters they had for the animals, until the water receded. The raft was not moved by the runoff because it was supported on the buttress of a canal and secured by ropes tied to large perforated stones that weighed it down. Surviving under such extreme conditions, when everyone thought they were dead, fixed the episode in the collective memory of the locals, which is integrated into the local collective imagination."

As a result of the downpour, the maximum water level in local rivers exceeded by more than 1.2 meters. The railway station and airport were flooded, and their operations were suspended. The most common version of the catastrophic scale of the flood is considered to be the malfunctioning of the storm drainage system, which was \"redesigned\" in preparation for the Winter Olympics — the redesign was mostly done on paper, and the money was embezzled. The editor-in-chief of \"BlogSochi,\" Alexander Valov, claims that during the construction of Olympic facilities, many natural drainage systems were destroyed, which could have channeled water during heavy rains. In addition, one of the reasons for the catastrophic flood he cites is that the pumps meant to drain rainwater stopped due to power outages. Sochi began to flood in September 2013 — during the construction of Olympic facilities, and in July 2014."

Below Zermatt, a lake formed due to a debris flow, submerging several buildings. The BVZ railway line between Brig and Zermatt was interrupted at several points and could only be put back into operation after 24 days. Debris flows destroyed houses and interrupted transportation routes in Mörel, in the Binntal, in Naters, and in Baltschieder. There, the Baltschiederbach flooded a settlement area of 733,000 square meters and left debris deposits of up to four meters high in the upper part of the village, destroying the water and electricity supply as well as telephone lines. Between Brig-Glis and Visp, the Gamsa flowed onto the construction site of the A9 motorway and over the railway lines of the SBB and BVZ. As a secondary consequence of the heavy rain in Upper Valais, there was severe flooding in Lower Valais. In Sion, the Vissingen Canal overflowed and flooded a commercial area. In Chamoson, the right bank of the Rhône dam broke, exposing the gas pipeline of the Gazoduc du Rhône, which lay unprotected above ground. Water flowed through the breach in the dam into the Rhône plain, washing debris and mud onto agricultural crops. A dam on the canal from Sion to Riddes also broke, and water overflowed from the canal from Leytron to Fully. The commercial area of Saillon, with several wineries, was flooded. In total, 1,027 hectares were finally underwater in the Rhône plain during the event."

A landslide above the village caused a protective wall to collapse on October 14, and the large mass of rock, soil, and debris from the wall struck several buildings below and slid further down into the gorge of the Doveria, which was experiencing flooding due to the rain. Ten houses were destroyed and 13 people lost their lives. The three-hundred-year-old Stockalperturm was damaged. Additionally, the flooding at the Doveria and the river Grosses Wasser in the Zwischbergental destroyed protective structures and bank reinforcements."

It spread over a large horizontal area, with vertical thickness of several kilometers throughout the troposphere. A low-pressure area formed over the Adriatic when cold and moist polar air penetrated the Mediterranean region. This polar front collided with a moist subtropical front, leading to the formation of very low pressure. On May 14, the cyclonic field moved towards the Balkans and \"settled\" over the area of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The saturation of the air mass was around 100%, and humidity increased due to warm air from the south and east. The physical-geographical specificity of the Balkan Peninsula also favored the development of such a low-pressure area. The center of the cyclonic field was over Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where between May 13 and 15, a large amount of precipitation was recorded, the highest ever recorded since meteorological observations began. The weakening and disappearance of the cyclone began on May 16 and ended on May 18."

The large amount of rainfall led to the emergence of flash floods, flooding, and the triggering of numerous landslides. This was also the rainiest May month in history. The multi-year average for this time of year is around 70 millimeters of precipitation; however, in 2014, as much as 214 liters per square meter fell (Belgrade)."

                "content": "Most of Australia has a very dry climate, and the central and southwestern part of the island-continent constitutes the Great Australian Desert, one of the largest in the world (about 2.5 million km²). Only the northern part of the island-continent, which is already in the intertropical zone, as well as the southeastern mountains (Australian Alps), have a somewhat rainier climate. The Murray River, in turn, has an irregular flow regime and relatively low flow, which is due to its long course through arid climate regions. Thus, although the Murray River with its tributaries (Darling, Murrumbidgee, and others) constitutes the largest river system in Australia, covering more than one million km², its economic benefits for agriculture, industry, and drinking water supply are not well developed, and there are possibilities to increase them through comprehensive basin planning. The Murray is a river that experiences strong floods and long periods of low water, so more multipurpose dams (hydroelectric, irrigation, flood control, and others) need to be built, infrastructure works must be carried out to prevent damage in the populations located mainly on the right bank of the river from the confluence with the Darling to the mouth, and areas of insufficient drainage must be channeled (which in Australia are called billabong and correspond in Spanish to the terms of abandoned meanders, horseshoe lakes, swamps, or sporadically flooded areas, etc.)."

                "content": "When talking about the floods in the Australian Murray River basin, it should be noted that, as it is located in the southern hemisphere, any moving body like the water of a river tends to deviate to the right, that is, the opposite of what happens in the northern hemisphere. However, this deviation is not real but apparent, as it is not that the river water deviates to the right, but rather that the Earth's surface rotates from right to left (from east to west), that is, counterclockwise. This means that, in a moving body with a constant direction (like the Foucault pendulum), the apparent deviation would be from left to right, or in other words, clockwise, for the simple reason that the base of the pendulum, that is, the Earth's surface, rotates in the opposite direction (counterclockwise). This is why practically all the cities affected by the floods in the Murray basin in 1956 were located on the right bank of the river. Among the flooded cities at that time, we can mention, including their location on Google Maps: Colignan, Iraak, which no longer exists and was replaced by a lake that is now almost dried up, Mannum, Murray Bridge, Mildura, Nangiloc, whose name is spelled backward from Colignan, Red Cliffs, Renmark, Wentworth, and others. All the indicated populations are located on the right bank of the Murray River (except for a couple of cases, where the population is divided in two by the river itself, as happens in Murray Bridge, although it is an exception that confirms the rule because the force of the flood affected the part of the city on the right bank. The case of Iraak, which is somewhat separated from the Murray River and is now practically uninhabited, is due to the fact that it was originally a military camp during World War II (it also had prisoners) and during the floods of 1956 it was flooded, creating a lake that still exists: on one hand, the location was a precarious and risky area and was only justified by temporary use as a military zone. On the other hand, the floods of that year highlighted the risk of that location and worsened the initial problem: it was probably easier to dismantle the camp and move than to carry out infrastructure works aimed at minimizing or eliminating the risks of that location. The Google Earth program is very useful for assessing the flood risk situation of any location in Australia (or anywhere) since by moving the cursor over the satellite image we automatically have the height in meters above sea level of any point, and this can indicate how frequent a situation is where the natural levees of a river are at a higher elevation than the surrounding plain, which is precisely why it is called a floodplain. In the specific case of Wentworth, which is located on the right bank of the Darling River at the confluence of this river with the Murray, the main reason for the flooding was not directly due to the rise of this river, but rather that this rise backed up the waters of the Darling upstream of the confluence, overflowing to the north of the population, which was almost completely flooded for some time. In a desert or semi-desert climate, most rivers are allochthonous and can have enormous floods due to the irregularity of the rains, which can be very scarce for years but can also be very intense and disastrous on some sporadic occasions, exacerbated by the fact that the large amount of sediment carried by the river waters (due to the sparse vegetation cover in a dry climate) tends to raise the riverbed and the natural levees, especially the left one, in the case of the Murray River because we are in the southern hemisphere. This is why most of the floods from the overflow of the river waters occurred on its right bank."

It is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn in the northern part of the country, so this area already has an intertropical climate (savanna, jungle in some places, and especially dry subtropical climate). Most of the territory has a desert or semi-desert climate (the deserts of Australia cover more than 2 million km²) and oceanic influences are very powerful, giving rise to tropical and extratropical storms, often very intense: In the specific case of Australia, having a relatively dry climate makes it an irregular climate, with years and even decades of very scarce rainfall and brief periods (weeks or months) of extraordinarily intense rain. In 1956, a rainy period of just over 3 months was recorded, leading to a huge flood that peaked in Morgan, South Australia, at 12.3 m, and these floods were felt up to 100 km away from the riverbanks. In the specific case of Morgan, it is also located on the right bank of the river (just like the previously mentioned towns) with the aggravating factor of being in a 90° bend of the Murray River to the left, which concentrated the effects of the flood due to the natural right levee being lower than the left in the southern hemisphere, so the centrifugal force of the flow in the river bend acted towards the location of that town. This location can be seen on Google Maps: Morgan, South Australia."

The Spaniards, despite being aware of the existing soil subsidence problems in Tenochtitlan, decided to establish the capital of New Spain there for political reasons. In addition to the geographical location, there were other changes that resulted in the rise of water levels: environmental changes, deforestation, and the expansion of crops that led to soil erosion.

The city was underwater, many houses collapsed, others were flooded, and their inhabitants could only stay on the second floor. The unsanitary conditions, scarcity, and disease that followed the flood caused the death of approximately 30,000 people in the following years. The flood also caused many people to emigrate from the city, most of whom settled in the city of Puebla.

Canoes were also used for transportation within the city. To prevent more houses from collapsing, it was ordered that each homeowner build a kind of wall attached to their wall to prevent the foundations from weakening. The measures taken to alleviate the situation were not sufficient; it was also necessary to drain the water from the city.

Given the situation and the lack of a short-term solution, the viceroy proposed to the city council the option of moving the capital to another city. But the city council responded that it would cost more money to change the capital than it would to rebuild it. It was decided that the only viable solution would be to find an effective drainage system. In 1634, the Carmelite friar and architect Andrés de San Miguel, at the request of the viceroy, corrected the drainage ditch of Mexico City, which had been built by Enrico Martínez, allowing the water to exit the city and enabling its reconstruction."

Although the direct damage from this typhoon was not significant, moist warm air flowed in from the Pacific Ocean into the extratropical low-pressure system that had transformed from the typhoon moving northeast over the Sea of Japan, colliding with the moist winds blowing in from Typhoon No. 17, which was approaching the Japanese archipelago from the sea east of Japan. This resulted in the continuous formation of rain clouds (linear precipitation bands) extending north and south. Heavy rainfall exceeding 300 millimeters within 24 hours caused large-scale damage, particularly in the northern Kanto region and southern Tohoku region. On September 9, heavy rain centered in the northern Kanto region was recorded, with AMeDAS observations from midnight on September 7 to 5 PM on September 10 showing over 300 millimeters in various locations in Tochigi Prefecture, including 551.0 millimeters in Nikko City, Iroha, and 541.0 millimeters in Nikko City, Imaichi. Additionally, total precipitation was recorded at over 400 millimeters in various locations in Tochigi Prefecture, including 645.5 millimeters in Imaichi, 622.0 millimeters in Iroha, 561.5 millimeters in Torobe, and 523.0 millimeters in Kanuma. At 12:20 AM on September 10, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rain warning for all of Tochigi Prefecture, and at 7:45 AM, a special heavy rain warning was issued for almost all of Ibaraki Prefecture, urging maximum vigilance against river flooding, landslides, and flooding in low-lying areas, while also calling for strict vigilance in surrounding prefectures. The area of rain gradually moved to the Tohoku region, and at 3:20 AM on the 11th, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rain warning for Miyagi Prefecture. The special heavy rain warnings issued for each prefecture were lifted in Tochigi Prefecture at 6 AM on the 11th, in Ibaraki Prefecture at 8:15 AM on the same day, and in Miyagi Prefecture at 7:30 PM. On September 18, the Japan Meteorological Agency named the heavy rain and the resulting disasters that struck the Kanto and Tohoku regions \"The September 2015 Kanto-Tohoku Heavy Rain.\" The Geospatial Information Authority of Japan established a special page on its official website for \"The September 2015 Kanto-Tohoku Heavy Rain,\" providing information on the disaster using topographic maps and aerial photographs. On October 6, the government decided in a cabinet meeting to designate the areas of Minamiaizu Town in Minamiaizu District and Showa Village in Onuma District as \"Localized Severe Disaster\" under the law concerning special financial assistance for dealing with severe disasters related to agricultural damage, which was announced and enacted on the 7th. This resulted in the national government increasing the cost-sharing ratio for municipalities conducting restoration work on farmland and agricultural facilities to as much as 90%. The heavy rain in Tochigi Prefecture and flooding in Ibaraki Prefecture have been compared to Typhoon No. 4 in 1998. While Typhoon No. 4 recorded intense rain with over 1000 mm of precipitation, the Kanto-Tohoku heavy rain had a total precipitation of about 600 mm, with hourly rainfall of about 50 to 70 mm (no record of extreme short-duration heavy rain was announced during the period)."

                "content": "The Santa Lucia flood was a flood that affected several European countries between December 13 and 14, 1287, and is named after the saint of the day, Lucia of Syracuse. As in other similar disasters in the area, such as the 1953 flood in the Netherlands, the phenomenon occurred due to the conjunction of a spring tide and a storm with low atmospheric pressure. The most severe consequences took place in Frisia, with about 50,000 direct deaths. The alteration of the land was such that a new sea, the Zuiderzee, was created, which had previously been a freshwater lake, the Flevo. The force of the tide collapsed the dunes that separated it from open waters, thus creating a new ocean entrance. Dozens of towns disappeared under the waves, new ports were created, and the need for more protection systems for coastal areas became evident, as the dike system installed in Western Frisia saved a large part of this region. The flood was also strongly felt in the British Isles, where the storm and waves buried entire hamlets. Some commercial ports, such as Dunwich, disappeared, causing significant economic losses. In the medium term, the flood contributed to waves of migration of people who did not feel safe in coastal areas and to new bogs generated or who had lost everything and sought ways to make a living in inland cities. It also affected the linguistic distribution of Frisian, which saw its area of influence reduced due to the death toll and population movements. Because of all this impact, the Santa Lucia flood is considered the fifth most important in recorded history, both for the high number of victims and for the consequences on relief, economy, language, and demographics over time."

The masses of water made their way from Leopoldau through Breitenlee, Markgrafneusiedl, Großhofen, Glinzendorf, Rutzendorf, Kimmerleinsdorf, Breitstetten, Haringsee, Straudorf, and Wagram on the Danube, flowing over the Marchfeld and re-entering the riverbed of the Danube at Stopfenreuth. A total of 74 people lost their lives due to the flood wave. Kimmerleinsdorf was almost completely destroyed. The streams of the Vienna Woods and the Wien River could also no longer drain and overflowed their banks. Large parts of the urban area were underwater for days. However, the city was hit much worse by the subsequent cholera epidemic, which was triggered by the flooded cesspools and the contaminated groundwater. By December 1831, around 2,000 people had died from cholera."

Four people drowned in Skopje, reported by 6 PM. The areas most affected in Skopje were the Municipality of Idadija, near the City Park, around \"Ilindenska\" Street, near the main post office, and the city square. Houses along \"Cvetan Dimov\" Street were endangered due to the overflow of the Serava River. Around 4 PM, all schools were dismissed. Those students who lived nearby were met by their parents at the school gate, but there were children who lived far away and could not go home due to the water. Work on the new concrete bridge was halted due to the heavy rains. However, the workers did not leave their posts and, together with experts, since three o'clock in the morning, they were removing large logs carried by the dangerous rapids of the Vardar River with long iron rods. This bridge was supposed to be put into use on November 29, 1962. The hydrometeorological service had installed a water gauge at this bridge. At 2:30 PM, a water level was recorded here that was eight centimeters higher compared to November 5, 1937, when the water level was 260 cm above normal, or 330 cm. The wooden pedestrian bridges were particularly endangered: near the National Theater and the bridge located between the new concrete bridge and the railway bridge. Due to their instability under the pressure of the rising waters, pedestrian traffic was prohibited on them on the morning of November 16. The railway bridge near the Military Hospital was closed to all trains, while movement on the railway bridge at Gjorce Petrov was allowed at five kilometers per hour. Only one bridge on the Vardar was safe — the Stone Bridge. The local headquarters for natural disasters immediately took measures to accommodate endangered families from the Idadija and Kisela Voda areas in the eight-year school \"Kocho Racin,\" and endangered families from the Municipality of Kale and the Municipality of Saat Kula in the Health Center of these municipalities. In these two points in the city, all lost children were also accommodated. The Vardar overflowed on \"Ilindenska,\" in \"Marshal Tito\" square, in the City Park, near the stadium, and everywhere the protective embankments were lowest. Many basements were flooded, and occasionally parts of the city were left without electricity. The water flooded the narrow and deep spaces of the \"St. Andrew\" monastery, and everything in the restaurant by Lake Matka was underwater. The villages around Gjorce Petrov were also affected. The dam of the new accumulation basin near the village of Bojane was breached. Due to the high water level of Treska, the lake at HEC \"Matka\" was overflowing, and therefore, the water was gradually released to prevent danger to the dam itself. In Saraj, the areas for camping houses were flooded."

Bogomila was cut off from other towns. The situation was similar in Debar. Tetovo was left without PTT connections. Kruševo was completely isolated from the world. For two days and two nights, the people of Struga fought against the massive water disaster of the lake. Around Lake Ohrid: scattered boats, filled with mud and various household items. In Struga, the lake overflowed and flooded the entire tourist settlement. The Sateska River flooded a large part of the Struga Field. The Jablanica River overflowed and flooded and destroyed the road in several places. Due to the prolonged heavy rains, the Vidobiska and Koselska Rivers overflowed to widths of 3 and 2 kilometers, respectively, along their entire course. These two rivers also flooded part of Ohrid. In addition to these two rivers, the Daljan River overflowed, reaching a width of about 2 kilometers. Due to the rising waters in Ohrid, about ten houses collapsed. Since the water rose more than one meter, access to the flooded houses was only possible by boat. About 350 families were evacuated and accommodated in the eight-year school \"Brotherhood - Unity,\" in the hotel of Jugohrom and the hotel of PTT. The water disaster caused several houses to collapse in Resen, Carev Dvor, Drmeni, Upper and Lower Bela Crkva, and others. All citizens aged 15 to 55 were mobilized. The village of Ezerene, south of Resen, was cut off from other settlements. Bitola and Pelagonia were underwater. After the heavy rains, the Crna River rose, followed by Šemnica, Dragor in Bitola, and Kurderes, as well as all their tributaries and village streams. In the morning, Dragor overflowed its banks near the slaughterhouse, and at the same moment, Kurderes did too, causing the waters to merge and flood a vast area right next to Bitola, in front of the railway line. Near the village of Novaci, the Crna River flooded 3,000 hectares of arable land. The waters of the Crna River also destroyed both large bridges near the village of Brod. The fish farm Vukri was also damaged. Near Titov Veles, the Vardar and Topolka rivers rose 4.5 meters above normal. The entire street \"Vasil Levski,\" on the left side of the Vardar, was flooded. The building of the \"Trajko Andrejev\" and \"Blagoj Kirkov\" schools were underwater up to the first floor. At the city market, the water reached a height of one meter. Five families were evacuated on the first day after the flood. Two bridges on Topolka were swept away. 6,000 chickens and chicks from the \"Stochar\" company were destroyed. Babuna overflowed its banks. Bogomila was completely isolated from the railway station because it was impossible to cross the bridge over Babuna. The water disaster uprooted trees along the riverbank and flooded the football field. In Bogomila and Tetovo, several houses were flooded, and according to initial estimates, about 70 hectares of planted areas were affected. Tetovo district: road and PTT traffic were interrupted. The swollen Pena, which rose more than one meter, collapsed the riverbanks at several points and flooded the streets: \"Leninova,\" \"Mirče Acev,\" and \"Jeni Malo.\" The cellars of some institutions, as well as the Veterinary Station, were flooded. In Prilep: the Oreovec River overflowed and swept away two wooden bridges in the Tabana area. In this area, a private house was also threatened due to landslides on the left riverbank. The river carried away trees and several heads of livestock. Large areas of the Prilep Field were found underwater."

The water disaster destroyed three bridges in Skopje and three in Gjorce Petrov. In Ohrid, 36 houses were destroyed by the flood, 57 were damaged, and access to 56 houses was impossible because they were filled with mud and water two days after the flood. A general mobilization of the population, members of the JNA, and the People's Militia was carried out in many cities, and all possible means of transportation were engaged. The trading house \"Skopje\" reported the first material damage of 300 million dinars. It was estimated that the total damage from the flood exceeded 10 billion dinars. The sewage and water supply networks were severely damaged, the pumping station at Rasce and the one at Kozle were destroyed. The Saraj was completely destroyed, and access to it was impossible. Underground waters appeared, breaking out even at distant places from the Vardar, such as near the railway station. The building of the National Theater in Skopje was damaged, especially the electrical installations, the mechanism for rotating the stage, and the wings. On the very first day after the flood, teams of soldiers and firefighters were sent from Nis, Leskovac, Surdulica, Urosevac, Kosovska Mitrovica, Belgrade, Prizren, and others. From Negotino to Demir Kapija, the Vardar was on average 400 meters wide. Near Gevgelija, a lake was 8 kilometers wide. In Gevgelija, 5 bridges were destroyed. Two kilometers from Gevgelija, trains were \"floating\" 200 meters through water. In Tetovo, 3,000 hectares were flooded, and 8 bridges were swept away. The archival material of the film production company \"Vardar - film\" was completely destroyed. The negatives of all feature-length and documentary films shot from 1945 until the day of the flood were completely destroyed. In the Skopje Zoo, only about 20 percent of the animals perished, while the rest were saved, including: lions, monkeys, an elephant, a hippopotamus, a tiger, and a reticulated python. In the efforts of the Yugoslav People's Army, the entire population and the People's Militia were joined by youth, who greatly contributed to providing assistance to those affected by natural disasters in all parts of Macedonia. Youth working brigades and groups made themselves available to the headquarters for combating natural disasters. Youth and student working groups participated in clearing the affected houses and rescuing endangered families. They organized the protection and cleaning of schools, dormitories, and other facilities. On November 19, 1962, 3,830 youths worked on clearing the streets in Skopje, while on November 20, 1962, around 5,000 youths were involved in the affected areas in Skopje and its surroundings. At the initiative of the Main and District Board of the Red Cross and the Headquarters for Combating Natural Disasters from the municipality of Idadija, a group of youth leaders and activists organized the transfer and care of children from the most affected families in the Idadija municipality area to the Red Cross center in Vodno. In this reception center, 72 children aged 7 to 14 were transferred. Such engagement of the youth was noted in other parts of Macedonia: Bitola, Titov Veles, Ohrid, Gevgelija, and other affected areas. Youth organizations also assisted in the actions of sanitary authorities for vaccinating the population to prevent the possible spread of infectious diseases."

                "content": "f1 Map with all coordinates of the mainly affected watercourses, places, and retention basins of the Corpus Christi flood: OSM | WikiMap The trigger of the flood was a heavy rain on June 21, 1984, of up to 150 mm, which fell over the catchment areas of Brehm (⊙49.5580979.520383, ⊙49.6192979.668103) and Schüpfbach (⊙49.553749.571589, ⊙49.515249.693058). The rain started in the afternoon and completely flooded the partly narrow stream valleys with flood waves of up to three meters high downstream. Severe storms occurred in the area of Kupprichhausen (⊙49.5269059.62103), Lengenrieden (⊙49.5279999.64004), Oberlauda (⊙49.56669.6787), Heckfeld (⊙49.551299.63651), Dittwar (⊙49.5902789.636111), Brehmen (⊙49.5694139.554947), Gissigheim (⊙49.5942789.58725), Königheim (⊙49.6177789.595556), and Tauberbischofsheim (⊙49.62259.662778). The center of the heavy rain was in the area of Hof Esselbrunn (⊙49.5730479.590232) and Reisberg (⊙49.5759.6045). The water masses flowed through the Eisgrundgraben (⊙49.5647749.61033, ⊙49.5907679.631603) and Ölbach towards Dittwar (13.5 cubic meters/second) and over the Adelsgraben above Gissigheim as well as the Brehmbach towards Königheim (10 to 19 cubic meters/second) and streamed towards the underlying villages and towns. In Kupprichhausen and Lengenrieden, a two-meter-high flood wave rushed through the Schüpfbach valley at about the same time over a width of 100 meters. The flood reached its peak around 5 PM with a flow rate of about 100 to 120 m³/s. Subsequently, at 5:18 PM, the disaster alarm for the Main-Tauber-Kreis was triggered by District Administrator Georg Denzer. As a result, police teams and a SAR helicopter from the Federal Air Force were ordered to the disaster area. In addition, emergency services from the DLRG, fire brigades, and the Technical Relief Organization were deployed to the area. Shortly thereafter, and only about half an hour after the rain stopped, the situation worsened again: the dam of the Gissigheim retention basin (⊙49.5788069.567639) broke around 5:20 PM after being overflowed with extremely high discharges. Prior to this, the bottom outlet had been blocked, and the flood relief system could no longer discharge the water masses after debris had severely impaired its performance at the grid cover of the relief system. As a result, the dam was overflowed up to 65 cm high before the break, with a maximum estimated outflow of 54 m³/s. The second flood wave triggered by the dam break damaged a large part of the houses in Königheim up to the second floor. The dam, like most dams of that time, was not built to withstand overflow without damage, and its air side was therefore not erosion-resistant. However, the actual reason for the dam break was not the receding erosion, but the integration of the relief system into the dam body, where a interlocking of the overflow structure was missing and cavities were present due to the receding components. The maximum water level in the reservoir was 10.7 m, with a storage volume of 0.144 million m³. At the beginning of the dam break, 0.165 million m³ were stored. Due to the retention effect of the widening Brehmbach valley, the second flood wave in Königheim could no longer be recognized as a single wave in the general flood. The maximum water level in Königheim persisted due to the retention effect until about 6 PM. Despite the dam break, the retention basin prevented even greater damage in Königheim, as it delayed the flood wave of the Brehmbach, allowing the flood waves from the catchment areas below the basin to run ahead and preventing the waves from overlapping. It was not until around 7 PM that the flood in Königheim had largely receded. The railway embankment at the Dittwar train station, lying across the flow direction of the Muckbach from Dittwar (⊙49.603579.6438) of the then railway line Tauberbischofsheim–Königheim prevented even greater disaster for Tauberbischofsheim. The Umpfertal, Königshofen, Sachsenflur, Schweigern, and Boxberg also got off relatively lightly due to the high railway embankments. These caused a backwater, which, however, became a disaster for other municipalities. In the aftermath, police, fire brigades, the Bundeswehr, Technical Relief Organization, DLRG, and DRK were continuously deployed. Several missing person reports were not confirmed, and there were no fatalities, but nine injuries. However, over 1200 animals died, half of them large livestock. 24 buildings were completely destroyed, and 184 were severely damaged. Large areas of the stream and river floodplains were underwater, and numerous buildings were threatened with collapse. The electricity and telecommunications networks, as well as the water supply, failed in large parts of the disaster area. In addition to federal road 27, several state and county roads were no longer passable. Over 100 vehicles were swept away by the water masses, completely demolished, or piled on top of each other. Even in the evening, the disaster response team called for drinking water to be boiled throughout the disaster area. In an initial estimate, the emergency management of the district office assumed about 7000 affected individuals who were directly impacted by the flood disaster, meaning they suffered significant damage to their property."

By morning, a large part of the water had drained away, and the levels at the Tauber were falling again. At 6:45 AM, technical response teams were formed in the four mainly affected municipalities (Königheim, Tauberbischofsheim, Boxberg, and Lauda-Königshofen). About 1,000 emergency personnel began the first cleanup efforts. District Administrator Georg Denzer stated in a press conference in the afternoon: \"At the moment, it is not my task to assess the damage caused. The priority was and is to contain the disaster and avert danger to people and animals. Now it’s time to clean up and rebuild. And for that, we need help.\" The initial priority was the evacuation of people from buildings at risk of collapse. In addition, efforts were made to restore power supply, telecommunications networks, and road connections. In areas with destroyed water supply, the population was supplied with water by tank trucks. Since the suction baskets of the fire pumps were repeatedly clogged, divers had to be deployed in Tauberbischofsheim in some cases. The Baden-Württemberg Interior Minister Dietmar Schlee visited the site on June 22 to get a personal impression of the emergency situation and promised quick assistance from the state."

The power and drinking water supply had been secured by emergency generators (including from Badenwerk) and water treatment plants. The structural securing of buildings and bridges, as well as the removal of about 1,200 animal carcasses, were the urgent tasks at hand. The floods had scattered the animal carcasses throughout the damage area, which was still partially flooded, or buried them under debris, making the cleanup efforts difficult. In addition, basements were cleared of mud, wood was removed, and apartments were cleaned. Another focus was on the removal of oil slicks after some oil tanks had toppled and leaked in flooded basements. The onset of disaster tourism on that Saturday was extremely disruptive for all involved. According to statements from emergency personnel, onlookers showed no regard for the people affected by the disaster and increasingly hindered the recovery efforts, necessitating cordons to be set up in an ever-widening radius."

While the cleanup and securing work in Königheim continued unabated in the inner areas, the tasks in other damaged areas increasingly shifted to areas outside the villages. Approximately 820 emergency personnel were still engaged. For example, the streams and bridge passages were mostly cleaned by hand of coarse debris, as hardly any trucks or excavators could be used on the still soaked and muddy grounds."

Heavy equipment was mostly not yet usable on the softened ground. Further buildings at risk of collapse were secured where possible, and some were also demolished. Areas that had already been completed became relevant again after numerous basements that had been pumped dry were refilled with infiltrating pressurized water. In the meantime, the farmers' association ensured the supply of agricultural businesses with feed and other necessary goods. Water tests by the State Chemical Testing Institute revealed that all water sources in the damage area were contaminated with coliform bacteria. The boil water advisory for drinking water therefore remained in effect until a threat to the population could be ruled out through daily sampling. Heavy clearing equipment was only needed to a limited extent, and the deployed federal units could be released from the disaster response. Although the operation was not yet finished on June 27, the number of aid workers could be gradually reduced a week after the flood. The Fronleichnam flood triggered the first and so far only disaster alarm in the Main-Tauber district."

                "content": "The Goglio is a mountain stream that originates from the lakes of the Orobie Alps above Lake Aviasco, flowing into the Serio in the valley bottom, in the Pranzera area of Gromo after a 5 km journey overcoming a height difference of about 1550 m. Since the 13th century, on the right side of the stream, from the hamlet of Colarete to the Pranzera area, its waters were used through sluices, serving factories that forged bladed weapons; this area was called the Goglio district. The extraction of iron and other minerals is documented as early as Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD), referring to the Christians condemned by the Romans to mine metals in the mines of the upper Val Seriana as Damnatio ad metalla in his Naturalis historia. The upper valley - along with other neighboring areas - was donated by Charlemagne in 774 to the monasteries of San Martino di Tours and Saint-Denis. Taken back by the church of Bergamo in 1026, it became the subject of disputes and clashes centered on mining rights between the bishopric and local noble families, who owned the lands with iron and silver mines. Among these were the Colleoni and the Rivola. In 1267, the town obtained the privilege of being called a borough, with the right to work the minerals enjoying the income derived from extraction and processing. The processing of iron in the upper valley became very important and more productive with the Venetian domination of 1427; it included not only the territory of Gromo, which was considered the small Toledo, but also the related industries of neighboring towns. The altarpiece of the Church of San Gregorio titled Madonna with Child between Saints Gregory the Great and Charles Borromeo, painted in 1624 by Enea Salmeggia, and the private property map drawn by the notary Bartolomeo Scacchi illustrate how the town appeared at that time and where the forges, houses, and other activities were located."

Several events coincided that, although having different causes, developed in a concatenated manner. Written testimonies recount continuous days of heavy rain that had swollen the stream, a fact certainly not rare, given that its waters were not regulated by dams or artificial basins. The testimonies collected from the shepherds who were resting in the locality on the opposite side of the valley and who faced the event describe a strong wind that lifted people and boulders; subsequently, a loud roar was heard, caused by the collapse of a part of the mountain called Cima Bani, a collapse likely caused by the rains and the severe deforestation that had occurred over the centuries to meet the great need for wood charcoal forges, which had made the ground unstable; descending into the valley, the landslide carried with it trees and stones, brushing against the Novazza fraction of Valgoglio, until it reached the Colarete fraction where it settled above the Goglio stream, blocking it and forming a lake, which, swollen with water, earth, and debris, overflowed, carrying with it materials and everything found along its path, as well as the forges, with the furnaces, hammers, warehouses, houses, and even two small churches. The book by Gabriele Medolago states on page 26: the church was completely destroyed... with some goods located in the same area and there was no hope of being able to rebuild churches or anything else due to the instability of the river. Upon reaching the valley floor, this landslide blocked the Serio, which, swollen by the materials and incessant rains, overflowed, taking with it men and houses, beyond the border of the country. All this was accomplished in the time of an Our Father."

The district of Goglio was located in the southernmost part of the country; there were 27 forges here; the houses of the workers; two small churches, that of San Rocco, the small oratory called Santa Croce, and two bridges that allowed access to the area north of the valley. In the upper part was the village, situated on a hill, with the castle and the palace inhabited by noble families, and further north in the valley, the parish church, which, given the noon hour, fortunately welcomed the faithful for the All Saints' Day services. The testimonies of the event have been documented since the first days. On November 3, a dispatch was sent to Venice by Captain Francesco Dandolo and Gerolamo Giustiniano, the podestà, with a detailed account of the events, damages, and victims; this document is preserved in the State Archive of Venice. On November 6, the archpriest of Clusone, Alessandro Ghirardelli, came for an inspection and, despite leaving a somewhat exaggerated testimony, describes not only the material damages but also the emotional situation of the villagers; as does the document of notary Gregorio Scacchi, now preserved in the archives of the parish of Gromo. The flooding of the Serio brought down not only debris but also the bodies of the victims, which are documented in the parish registers. The remains of the dead extracted from the waters of the river are documented in the archives of Parre, Alzano Lombardo, up to Seriate. The event was also reported by the historian Giovanni Maironi da Ponte.\""

The demographic decline within the first month was 30%; the flood had forced the labor force to migrate to other locations, suddenly finding themselves without work and unable to wait for the reconstruction, which could not be immediate; even the dead were not immediately extracted from the rubble, but are documented in the church records from December 1666 to all of 1667. In Venice, procedures were initiated for tax relief, which were initially granted for five years, and then renewed from time to time. The damages were estimated at 60,000 scudi, which justified the exemptions from the payment of taxes and rents, practiced from 1666 until the mid-18th century. In 1733, a list was drawn up of families entitled to compensation from the Venetian republic. The recovery and reconstruction were very slow; in fact, it took fifty years before the destroyed part of the settlement was reused; other forges were built, but the activity that had made the town of Gromo famous no longer yielded the same profits: times had changed, the demands were different; however, subsequent production is documented, not only of white weapons but also of arquebuses."

In Berguedà, it had serious consequences for the economy, as in addition to destroying communication infrastructure and private property, it severely affected the textile industry and mining, the two economic pillars of the region at that time. The existence of the Baells dam prevented the damage from being even more severe in the Llobregat valley. Fortunately, there were no human losses, as there were in the Alt Urgell and Andorra due to these floods."

At that time, there was no rain gauge in Berguedà that measured the intensity of rain per hour, but the total rainfall in 48 hours in the upper Berguedà was around 400 mm on average, meaning it is estimated that in two days it rained the amount corresponding to half a year. As a consequence, the flows of the rivers and streams in the Llobregat basin increased extraordinarily."

Considering that the safety level is at 625, and that the bottom and mid-level sluices can release up to 160 m³/s, it was already anticipated that the overflow sluices would need to be opened. Between 4 and 5 PM, the nearest towns were alerted: Civil Guard, Red Cross, Civil Protection, Water Confederation, and Berga Firefighters. The municipalities were not notified, as it was considered that no one would be found there at that hour. In the towns of lower Berguedà located by the Llobregat River, such as Gironella, concern began to grow over the rising river. Although it had rained in the lower part of the region, such a large increase in flow was not explained, as the magnitude of the rains in upper Berguedà was unknown. The intensity of the rains was greater the higher one went. At 8 PM, the water had already reached the level of the river street in Gironella, and the local Red Cross and volunteer firefighters began to work, monitoring the river's course. At 10:30 PM, the peak time for water entering the La Baells reservoir at 1,200 m³/s, a call was made from the reservoir to the Gironella Nursing Home, informing them that they had begun to evacuate the residents. Considering the time it could take for the water to arrive, the sluices were opened. They released 800 m³/s, while the usual flow is 7 m³/s. The reservoir level reached up to 631.48, one and a half meters above the maximum capacity (630). It was a delicate moment, as it was the first time the reservoir had reached this point and it was unknown how the dam would respond."

The quantification of the losses caused by the heavy rain and the flood to economic activities indicates that 49% corresponds to mining, 41% to industry, 8% to agriculture, and 2% to commerce. In terms of municipalities, those with the highest losses are, in order: Cercs (1.5 billion pesetas), Puig-reig (737 million), Gironella (180 million), Casserres (144 million), Guardiola (77 million), Berga (76 million), Fígols (62 million), La Pobla (52 million). On the other hand, regarding private property, the most affected were the towns with buildings along the river. The force of the water, when the water level reached the height of the buildings, demolished several homes, some completely and others partially. The affected municipalities were: Guardiola, Gironella, and La Pobla de Lillet. Additionally, these same towns, along with Puig-reig, Cercs, and Bagà, suffered damage to facilities, communications, and municipal public works such as bridges, paths, roads, retaining walls, etc. Overall, the damage to roads, bridges, and communications of local and regional roads exceeded 100 million pesetas."

The rise in the river level covered all the machinery and facilities, which meant that, in addition to repairing or replacing it, they were left without energy production. The affected companies in the turbines in Berguedà were: Filatura Berguedana (La Pobla de Lillet), Colònia Rosal, Cal Metre (Gironella), Filats i Teixits Fusté (Cal Bassacs), Viladomiu Nou, Viladomiu Vell, Ferrer (Vilada), Colònia Guixaró (Casserres), Colònia Prat (Puig-reig), Colònia Pons (Puig-reig), Colònia Marçal (Puig-reig), Colonia Manent (Puig-reig) and l'Ametlla de Merola.

The different openings of the operation acted like a sponge through which water filtered, gradually flooding all the galleries and accumulating in the deepest part of the operation, where it reached a height of 75 m. All the machinery and equipment present became unusable. As a result, the company submitted a temporary suspension of contracts that affected 300 workers (although it was initially planned for 776 workers)."

The Red Cross burst into the Cinema Victòria to warn if there were neighbors who had houses on the riverbank. The volunteer firefighters were watching over the Hospital building, the nursing home. Between nine and half past nine, a crowd of people had already gathered near the bridge of the Eres and the Old Bridge, where it was expected that the flood would have repercussions. At that same hour, a house on the river street, the Ferrer family (ca la Maruja), had already been evacuated, as the water was reaching above the door. Simultaneously, water began to enter the basement of the Sant Roc Hospital-Residence; however, the lack of communication about what was happening upstream and the lack of foresight meant that the evacuation of the elderly did not begin until much later. Access to the Old Bridge and the bridge of the Eres was cut off due to the danger of collapse, which eventually happened, isolating the Cal Ramons neighborhood and the Eres neighborhood from the urban center. The old town could only be accessed through the wall. The houses on the left side of Avinguda Catalunya were evacuated, from the bridge of the Eres to the Abattoir. The river street was also evacuated, where it was no longer possible to transit and water was already entering basements and ground-floor apartments. In this street, water entered all the basements and several homes were completely destroyed. As for the Sant Roc Residence, since the water reached the main door, all the elderly residents were evacuated through the ambulance garage and the passage leading to Avinguda Catalunya, and were initially moved to the Pearl Pub, the Cinema Victòria, and the basement of the Parochial House. The operation lasted until 3 AM. The Apolo building on Avinguda Catalunya was also evacuated, as the water was attacking its foundations. Power, drinking water, and telephone supply cuts lasted well into the next day, Monday. The Town Hall offered an apartment and financial assistance to families who had been left homeless."

When the water level receded, the first to enter the building found that the machinery was rendered unusable—some machines were in irreparable condition—walls had collapsed, everything was covered in mud, and the thread was scattered. The Bonser warehouse, which was full of manufactured goods, was left empty. The initiative to try to return to activity began immediately. The company applied for unemployment for the workers. At the same time, the population, which largely depended on work at the factory, collaborated in the recovery efforts. The predominant feeling was to act quickly to return to normalcy. The first job that kept most of the population occupied was removing mud, using rakes and dumpers. Meanwhile, women and retirees also helped by cleaning small items. Efforts were made to save the electrical parts of the looms, and on the other hand, the mud was removed from the looms with the pump that was lent to them by the farmers of the municipality of Sagàs, which were later cleaned with kerosene and sprayed with antioxidants. The Vocational Training School of Navàs also provided personnel and tools to assist in the recovery efforts. In short, it was a model of cooperation to save not only a company, on which jobs depended, but to return to normalcy for a community, with the associated social and cultural aspects."

A collapse caused the waters of Laguna Verde (Aysén), in the commune of Chile Chico, to flood the mine galleries. At the time of the flooding, which occurred in the early morning, miners Jorge Sánchez Martínez and Enrique Ojeda González were working on level 55. On the surface, outside the mine, it was noticed that the fans, responsible for injecting fresh air into the shaft, had stopped working and an alarm sounded for only 10 seconds. At five in the morning, a supervisor entered the mine and discovered the tragedy: the mine had been flooded. The location of the workers at the time of the accident is unknown, but it is presumed that they headed to a refuge on level 203, which was attempted to be reached in a second drilling attempt, as the first failed. Simultaneously, rescue teams attempted to contain the flooding through dikes. The miners' unions proposed bringing in robots and divers to cross the flooded areas and search for the miners in the galleries. After 18 days of searching, on Tuesday, June 27, 2017, the Cerro Bayo company officially announced the death of the miners."

                "content": "The rainy season front that was near the Hokuriku region until July 4th moved south from the Korean Peninsula to western Japan starting July 5th. On the morning of the 5th, a line of rain clouds developed in western Shimane Prefecture, creating a linear precipitation band that resulted in record rainfall. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rain warning for Shimane Prefecture (including Hamada City, Masuda City, Onan Town, and Tsuwano Town in the west) at 5:55 AM on the 5th (which was lifted at 11:15 AM the same day). In the afternoon of the 5th, cumulonimbus clouds formed successively in the northern part of the Chikugo region in Fukuoka Prefecture, moving eastward while developing and forming a linear precipitation band. As a result, intense rain continued for a long time in the same location. Rainfall exceeding 100mm per hour was analyzed from radar observations in Asakura City, Ukiha City, Kurume City, Higashitake Village in Fukuoka Prefecture, Tosu City in Saga Prefecture, and Hita City in Oita Prefecture. In particular, around Asakura City, approximately 400mm of rain was analyzed over three hours and about 900mm over twelve hours. Outside of the Japan Meteorological Agency's jurisdiction, a rain gauge in Teranai, Asakura City recorded 169mm of rainfall in one hour until 3:20 PM on the 5th, while a rain gauge in Kurokawa (Kita Koji Community Center) recorded 778mm of rainfall over nine hours until 8:50 PM on the 5th (averaging about 86mm per hour). This one-hour rainfall approached the Japanese record of 187mm (Nagasaki Prefecture, Nagayo Town, during the 1982 Nagasaki flood), and the nine-hour rainfall significantly exceeded the twelve-hour rainfall record of 695.0mm observed by the Japan Meteorological Agency (Kochi Local Meteorological Observatory, during the 1998 Kochi heavy rain), indicating that the precipitation intensity in the mountainous areas of Asakura City was among the highest in Japan's meteorological observation history within that nine-hour timeframe. At 5:51 PM on the 5th, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rain warning for the Chikugo and Chikuho regions in Fukuoka Prefecture, stating that \"the danger of significant damage is imminent.\" Furthermore, at 7:55 PM, a special heavy rain warning was issued for almost all of Oita Prefecture. At 3:10 AM on July 6th, the Japan Meteorological Agency added five cities and two towns in Fukuoka Prefecture to the special heavy rain warning area, which now included most of Fukuoka Prefecture and almost all of Oita Prefecture. At the time of the heavy rain, warm and moist air was flowing in from a tropical depression over the southern sea towards the rainy season front near the Tsushima Strait in northern Kyushu, while cold air was present aloft, creating a very unstable atmospheric condition. In this environment, cumulonimbus clouds formed successively at the boundary between the warm air near the surface and the cold air. The cooled air from the previously rainy regions of Chugoku and Shikoku flowed in and intensified the situation. Additionally, moist air flowed in from two directions surrounding the Sefuri Mountains on the border of Fukuoka and Saga Prefectures, merging on the eastern side of the Sefuri Mountains, which is believed to have strengthened the rainfall. The linear precipitation band was maintained through a process called back-building, where cumulonimbus clouds repeatedly formed and developed while moving eastward. The weather forecast for the morning of the heavy rain day predicted cloudy weather in the Chikugo region, with severe thunderstorms in some areas in the afternoon, while western Oita Prefecture was forecasted to be sunny then cloudy, with thunderstorms expected in some areas from the morning."

The total residential damage in Fukuoka and Oita Prefectures includes 336 completely destroyed buildings, 1,096 partially destroyed buildings, 44 buildings with some damage, 180 buildings with flooding above the floor, and 1,481 buildings with flooding below the floor (including damage from Typhoon No. 3). According to a survey by Professor Motoyuki Ushiyama of Shizuoka University’s Disaster Prevention Center, the causes of death and missing persons were 23 from landslides and 18 from flooding. Many houses were swept away by the flood, and despite the high number of flood victims, many (30 people) were affected indoors, which is a characteristic of this heavy rain disaster."

In Hita City, Oita Prefecture, part of the Ōhi River overflowed, leading to the isolation of some areas. The Hanagatsukawa River also flooded in Hita City. A large amount of driftwood was observed in the disaster area, with the total amount estimated to be about 200,000 tons, or 360,000 cubic meters. Trees such as cedar, which were knocked down by landslides, flowed down the river, blocking the river's flow and causing flooding. The driftwood that surged into residential areas increased the destructive power compared to just the water flow, causing significant damage to houses. In addition to direct destruction, the driftwood also caused damage indirectly by increasing the pressure of the water flow. In Hita City, a bridge on the JR Kyūdai Line crossing the Hanagatsukawa was washed away, and it is believed that the driftwood got caught on the bridge, causing the water to be blocked and increasing the water volume, which exerted a great force on the bridge."

The landslide blocked the river, creating a debris dam. The mountainous area with a geological formation known as \"masago soil\" could not withstand the sudden heavy rain, leading to surface collapses in various locations. The surface collapse caused cedar driftwood to flow into the river, resulting in the collapse of a reservoir. It has also been pointed out that the artificial forests, which are densely populated with trees like cedar, have not been properly managed, as thinning and improving sunlight exposure are necessary for the trees to grow and develop deep roots."

The floodwaters of the Odra entered the city on July 12, 1997, and finally receded on August 6. The millennium flood in Wrocław was particularly severe because two flood waves overlapped: from the Odra and the Widawa. Additionally, a few days before the peak, the residents of the village of Łany near Wrocław did not allow it to flood, which would have significantly reduced the damage. Due to the specific course of the river through the city, the overflow occurred independently both in the center and in the northern part of Wrocław. 40% of the city's area was underwater."

The fact that the city's residents already knew from the press, radio, and television about the damage caused by the Oder in Racibórz and Opole, and that for most of them it was a day off work, significantly influenced their mobilization and ability to self-organize in response to the impending threat. Already on the preceding Thursday (July 10), the city's president, Bogdan Zdrojewski, alarmed by the situation in Opole, urged the residents of Wrocław to start stockpiling drinking water, and to the directors of the largest institutions in the city – to take appropriate preparatory actions in case of flooding.

                "content": "On Thursday and Friday, the possibility of lowering the flood wave approaching Wrocław by breaching the dikes in Jeszkowice and Łany was considered. However, the opposition from a large group of gathered residents of these villages and Kamieniec Wrocławski, particularly in Łany, prevented the water from spreading over the local fields and residential buildings. Although preparatory work and the gathering of explosives by sapper units were already underway, and the dikes were secured by a police cordon, people alarmed by one of the residents poured out on the night of July 11 to defend the village from flooding. During the installation of explosives, there were skirmishes between the sappers and the residents of Łany. In the morning, the deputy voivode canceled the sapper operation, and the population was informed that \"there had been a mistake.\" A new operation was undertaken by the voivode, who arrived in the village around 6:00 PM, but he also failed to convince the residents. The deputy commander of the Wrocław police, Jan Albrechciński, refused to use force. The Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration, Leszek Miller, who was in Wrocław that day, demanded the dismissal of the deputy commander. Another decision was made at four in the morning. The operation was carried out from helicopters, but the explosives turned out to be too small to blow up the dikes. The next day, the Prime Minister Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz, who was in Wrocław, signed blank promissory notes to compensate for the losses after the destruction of the village. The voivode and the marshal of the local government assembly, Leon Kieres, went to Łany with the promissory notes. They also failed to convince the residents. The situation in Łany was the subject of comments from politicians, ethicists, hydrologists, and even the Supreme Audit Office. A journalist from Gazeta Wyborcza commented on the residents' stance: Łany became a symbol. For some, the lesser evil, that is, the attempt to save a large city at the cost of flooding several hundred farms and houses in fifteen villages; for others, the determination of ordinary people against a soulless, arrogant authority ready to use the police and military to destroy their life's possessions in the name of saving Wrocław's monuments. On the same day, President Zdrojewski issued an order to evacuate residents of neighborhoods bordering Wrocław from the north and east. However, most residents refused and stayed in their homes."

Panic spread in the city, and some residents accused the president of collusion with mineral water bottlers. On July 11, work began on building flood barriers in the city. The action was coordinated by the flood committee, and work was carried out in shifts. According to estimates from the City Hall, between 300,000 and 480,000 sandbags were laid in Wrocław. Some bags were even brought in by air, including from Gdańsk. The bags were filled not only with sand brought in for this purpose from sandpits; there was widespread permission to use sand gathered for street repairs in various parts of the city (for instance, a significant section of the finished subgrade on General Józef Haller Street was dug up for this purpose); most children's sandpits in Wrocław were also emptied in the process. Soil was also taken from lawns. In the most flood-prone areas of the city, the bags were mainly laid by spontaneously gathering volunteers, especially in the first hours of the threat, who generally directed themselves to the appropriate places based on their own knowledge of the local topography, often also in response to announcements made on the radio and television. Later, organized groups of soldiers and firefighters from across the country also arrived at these locations. On Friday, July 11, the flood embankment in Siechnice was breached, which ultimately determined the arrival of the flood wave in Wrocław. On July 12, around 6:00 AM, police alerted the residents of the Księże Małe estate, announcing through megaphones the necessity of immediate evacuation in the face of the approaching flood wave from the northeast (the Oława River basin). However, a significant majority of residents remained in their homes and began preparations to fend off the flood wave. For this purpose, every available source of sand was used, for example, all nearby sandpits were completely emptied. Car owners tried from early morning to move their vehicles and park them in other parts of the city; some desperately searched for any elevations in the area to protect their vehicles from destruction. Around 1:00 PM, water overflowed onto Opolska Street and surged into the estate, reaching a height of 180 cm within an hour. Streets such as Katowicka, Chorzowska, Bytomska, Tarnogórska, and Głubczycka were flooded. For the next few days, food and water were delivered by military Mi-17 helicopters, whose crews dropped supplies onto building roofs or lowered them on ropes."

                "content": "On Saturday, July 12, water surged into the city center, likely through Żabia Grobla and Traugutta Street, where the levees were breached. It then reached the city moat via Kościuszki Street and Komuny Paryskiej, flooding the surrounding neighborhoods, and by night reached Piłsudski Street and the Main Station to the south, while flowing towards Legnicka Street and the Szczepin neighborhood to the west. In this way, the northern part of the city was completely cut off from the southern part. It was only on Monday, July 14, in the afternoon, that residents managed to stop the water at Żabia Grobla. The Zalesie and Zacisze neighborhoods, located between the flood channel and the old Odra riverbed, were also affected, while Sępolno and Biskupin were protected before flooding. The Wrocław Zoo was also saved (only one zebra died, scared by the noise of helicopters), while the recently renovated Japanese Garden was affected just before the Eucharistic Congress. Water invaded neighborhoods built on flood-prone areas: Kowale, Maślice, Księże Małe, Księże Wielkie, Rakowiec, the Widawa neighborhood, and Pracze Odrzańskie. The Kozanów neighborhood was particularly devastated, where the waves of the Odra and Ślęza rivers overlapped. In this area, the water reached even the first floor. This neighborhood was built on floodplains, and due to delays in the decision to breach the flood levees and the flooding of recreational plots, the situation became critical at one point. Similarly, the water reached the first floor in Rakowiec (the so-called Bermuda Triangle), and the tenement houses there, many of which were built before World War II and often had wooden ceilings, were so severely damaged that many had to be demolished (a few collapsed on their own; no one was harmed). In Szczepin, the water remained exceptionally long due to the terrain's shape. The flood lasted the longest in Kozanów and Księż Mały, where even several days after the wave passed, access to buildings was only possible with the help of a pontoon or kayak. On July 16, the water began to recede from the city center. That day, bus services resumed. On Friday, July 18, the water level at the measurement point in Trestno dropped by more than 1.5 meters; water began to drain from Popowice. On the same day, a second wave of flooding was expected; the president ordered the immediate evacuation of residents from the northwestern districts of the city, including Leśnica and Pracze Odrzańskie. The situation was worsened by heavy rain falling during those days. It was only around July 22 that the areas near Siechnice began to dry out. Desperate residents of this town blocked the road to Wrocław. On July 23, the Ślęza river overflowed (due to backflow) and flooded Kozanów and Muchobór again. The second wave of flooding reached Wrocław on July 25 around 6:30 PM, once again flooding Siechnice."

                "content": "The flood relief operation was conducted by the then-existing Provincial Flood Committee, the District Flood Committee, and the City Flood Committee established by a special presidential decree. A large operation took place on the night of July 12 to 13 on Ostrów Tumski, trying to save the most valuable monuments. In addition to volunteers, the fire brigade was working, controlling the flow of large objects: trees, containers, and even kiosks, which could strike critical points at any moment, such as a bridge span. Other important sites saved included the main train station, the Ossolineum library, and the collections of the National Museum. Efforts were made even at the risk of health and life. As Bogdan Zdrojewski recalls, at one point, one of the firefighters drove a pike too hard into a floating tree and, wanting to save it, nearly jumped into the water like a pole vaulter. The force of the water was simply enormous. He was barely kept on the shore. The same happened with a young man who tried to pull a floating object from the water while defending the zoo. There, the current was quite fast, and he probably owed his life to the reflexes of his colleagues. About 5,000 people participated in the rescue efforts, and during the entire flood period, 20,000 people helped. To protect the southern districts of the city from flooding, it was necessary to create a dam along the railway viaduct running from Brochów, through the Main Station, and further towards the Fabryczna district. As a result, the water was forced to flow through a narrow strip of the city to connect with the original current near Kozanów. This plan succeeded, and the southern districts were ultimately not flooded. The rescue operation also faced bureaucratic obstacles. The city president sought immediate vaccination of residents against typhoid and tetanus, which he did not receive approval for. There was a lack of cooperation between central institutions, and problems arose related to the division of responsibilities: state services were responsible for hydrotechnical facilities. There was also a lack of financial decisions. One of the bizarre accusations was the Supreme Audit Office's objection that President Zdrojewski did not sign the attendance list during the flood. Concurrently with the rescue operation, a humanitarian aid operation for the residents of the flooded city was underway. Convoys with aid were arriving in the city, despite the difficult access. The largest coordination center for aid was located in the Poltegor building (where, among others, Lower Silesian Television was based). The president, police, and volunteers worked there."

The supply of vaccines quickly ran out, and residents began to fear an epidemic. Water was shut off throughout the city, some neighborhoods were cut off from electricity, and phones and much of public transport were also not working. Food was delivered to buildings cut off from water by thirty military Mi-17 helicopters. The few wells were used, including one at the Powstańców Śląskich roundabout. People gathered on the roofs of flooded buildings, where social life took place, and from there they communicated with the outside world. The media, especially radio and Lower Silesian Television, informed about how to communicate with helicopters: white meant a need for emergency help, red for medical assistance. There were also pathological phenomena: the police arrested people speculating on the prices of mineral water, some demanded 200 zł for a ride on a pontoon, and there were also break-ins into homes abandoned during the flood. The police arrested a man who had gathered blankets and camping beds in his apartment, probably for resale at a profit. Those profiting from the sale of gifts for flood victims were to be punished under Article 204, paragraph 2 of the Penal Code concerning the appropriation of entrusted property, which carried a penalty of 6 months to 5 years in prison. During the flood, the most important task was to save the city. During a mass at the church on Wittiga Street, the pastor told the participants: we can pray another time, now take shovels and rubber boots and go save the zoo. Grocery stores in the center opened on Monday, July 14. Among the most sought-after items were bread, cigarettes, and batteries. Despite the difficulties, most had no trouble with supplies. The Wrocław PDT opened in the afternoon and sold the most necessary items from under the raised grate of the main entrance. The police asked stores to start mobile sales and from pontoons to flooded districts as much as possible. Due to the lack of electricity, some goods, such as ice cream, were given away for free. Pharmacies operated normally, and in cases of chronic illnesses, no prescription was needed; it was enough to show the packaging of the medicine. There were also humorous situations, such as young men diving into a liquor store. Another situation was recalled by then-President Bogdan Zdrojewski: I was surprised, for example, by the reaction of a very young man who slowed down his kayak at the sight of a red light at one of the flooded intersections. He looked left, right, and continued to paddle. Despite the serious atmosphere, numerous jokes circulated around the city, specifically referring to the flood, for example: A lady calls and says she has two dogs on a chain in her yard. – And how long is the chain? – they ask at the flood committee. – Well, about two meters. – Extend the chain – they hear in response – a three-meter wave will come. The reactions of residents to the flood varied depending on their age. For the young, it was an opponent to be faced, and they treated it with almost sporting engagement; the older ones saw it as a threat to their property and things of sentimental value, and even a threat to life. Nevertheless, there were no visible differences in action."

Gradually, the airtime dedicated to information about the flood was increased, and from July 10, current information also appeared at night. From Saturday, July 12, until July 16, flood news was broadcast non-stop. The action initiated by the station was joined by President Bogdan Zdrojewski and Voivode Janusz Zaleski. The television also collaborated with the editorial offices of Słowo Polskie and local radio stations. In addition to its informational activities, the station coordinated the actions of services and volunteers fighting the flood, and the editorial office was transformed into a crisis management team. They organized sandbags, volunteers, as well as the distribution and coordination of aid for those affected by the flood. Dozens of phone numbers, both landline and mobile, were activated to help in the search for missing persons. The television returned to its regular programming only on July 28. The second information center, especially important for those without electricity, was Radio Wrocław. The hunger for information among the city's residents was great, and humanitarian convoys often encountered requests for batteries for radios. The flood also affected the editorial offices of Gazeta Wrocławska and the Lower Silesian Gazeta Wyborcza, but both of these newspapers had their printing houses in locations outside Wrocław; Gazeta Wrocławska moved its editorial office to a printing house in Bielany."

The concert hall building was flooded, but pianos were managed to be saved. The ground floor of the Music Academy was also submerged. The Polish Theatre and the regional court were also flooded. Additionally, three sports halls, the city port, a water treatment plant, and the recently renovated Świebodzki Station were affected by the flood. Furthermore, 44 km of roads and 21 bridges, footbridges, and viaducts needed to be rebuilt. The repairs cost the city 132 million zlotys, and 115 million zlotys in grants were obtained: 66.2 million zlotys from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 43 million zlotys from the World Bank, and 5.7 million zlotys from the Phare program. A decision was also made to modernize the Wrocław water junction and to construct the Odra-Widawa canal. In 2017, the Wrocław water junction was prepared for a capacity of 3,100 m³/s, new levees were built, and old ones were reinforced, while the Odra riverbeds were cleared and widened. The city's sand protection was also improved to 300,000 bags (20,000 m³). The renovation of the Kozanowska Embankment ensured that the neighborhood is safe in case of rising water levels."

Despite this, the diet of the people was maintained by eating waterfowl, marsh herbs, roots, insects, and fish from the lake itself. The year of greatest scarcity and hunger was 1454. As a result of the hunger, many inhabitants left the region, some died in the fields, and others took refuge in regions like Totonacpan (now the Sierra Norte de Puebla) never to return.

It brought moist Mediterranean air masses against the Pyrenees on its front side. Météo-France issued storm warnings starting June 17, which were only lifted on June 19. In Vielha, 115 liters/m² of rain fell from June 17 to June 18 within 24 hours. In winter, there had been up to 4 meters of snow, the largest amounts since 1980. In total, precipitation and meltwater reached a record level that had not been seen since measurements began in 1959. The area had already experienced a prolonged period of bad weather (in the context of severe flooding in central Europe in early June), causing the waters to drain immediately. The Gave de Pau reached record levels at several gauges. In Spain, the maximum flow rates were 10 to 20 times the normal (Noguera Pallaresa 160 m³/s, Noguera Ribagorçana 190 m³/s). The northern side of the Pyrenees was more severely affected, while on the southern side, the flood levels from October 2012, which had been the most severe event in the last 50 years, were generally not fully reached."

Especially the water masses of the Garonne caused numerous landslides and washed away several houses, roads, bridges, and countless trees. Several disaster management plans (crisis cells) were activated in the departments of Haute-Garonne and Hautes-Pyrénées. Authorities evacuated 3,000 people. In the pilgrimage site of Lourdes on the banks of the Gave de Pau, the underground Basilica of Pius X was flooded, and the Bernadette Basilica from the 19th century and the Marian grotto itself were also affected. In the city, damages amounted to double-digit millions, significantly exceeding the costs of the floods that had occurred shortly before in October 2012. The valley of Pays Toy at Bastan in the Adour catchment area was also severely affected. Approximately 9 million euros in aid funds were disbursed in the Garonne area."

The rain began in the evening of the 14th and turned into a torrential downpour with thunder in the early hours of the 15th, resulting in record rainfall exceeding 400 millimeters in mountainous areas. This rain triggered landslides in various locations, leading to mudflows containing large amounts of driftwood. Many reservoirs and embankments of tributaries of the Kizugawa River collapsed. In Ide Town, the collapse of the Taisho Pond and the Ninotani Pond upstream of the Tamagawa caused mudflows, which also led to the collapse of the Tamagawa downstream. In the area corresponding to the later Yamashiro Town (now Kizugawa City), the Fudo River and Narukogawa River collapsed, and in Wazuka Town, the Wazukagawa River flooded, causing significant damage. The term \"heavy rainfall\" is said to have first appeared in newspaper headlines during this event."

Around 2:30 AM, the first breach occurred at the Saida River, and flooding began in the low-lying areas of Ide Town. From around 3 AM, overflow and breaches started to occur sequentially on the right bank (north side) downstream of the Tamagawa River. Then, around 4 AM, agricultural reservoirs upstream (Taisho Pond and Nino Valley Pond) breached almost simultaneously, causing a mountain tsunami. This led to further breaches upstream of the Tamagawa River, resulting in significant damage to Ide Town. The Tamamizu area of Ide Town is surrounded by levees on three sides: the Kizugawa levee, the Tamagawa levee, and the Taga-Tanikawa levee, making it a typical area prone to internal water flooding. As a result, while drainage progressed early in other affected areas, the water level in this area did not decrease even days after the disaster, and many of the missing persons were found to have washed up in this location."

On the 16th, relief supplies were transported by U.S. Marine Corps helicopters to Wazuka Town, Minamiyamashiro Village, and the Dosenbo area, which had been cut off from transportation. From the 18th, supplies such as salt, rice, and vegetables were recorded. Relief supplies were transported from the Noden area to the severely affected Dosenbo cattle and horse area. A diary of recovery activities since the flood has been left in the Noden area, noting that the residents engaged in recovery efforts. In September, operations on the Nara Line and Kansai Main Line resumed. At Tamamizu Station, a large stone that washed ashore from the Tamagawa River remains as a memorial. In 1954, a memorial tower for flood victims was established. The reconstruction of the washed-away Tamamizu Bridge was completed in November 1956. On the site of Taisho Pond and Nino Valley Pond, a new Taisho Pond was created under the \"Yodogawa River System Improvement Basic Plan,\" which was completed in 1960."

The highest peaks of rain were recorded at Col Barant, which measured approximately 312 mm (373 mm if all three days are considered) and at Prali, which recorded 219 mm (276 mm if all three days are considered). On May 29, the Amedeo di Savoia hospital in Turin was evacuated and closed due to a possible overflow of the Dora Riparia river, while several bridges in the city and province were closed. At 10:25, the most tragic event of the flood occurred: a large mass of mud and debris from the Rio Cassarot basin, approximately 40,000 m³, fell into Val Pellice, flooding the village of Garin in Villar Pellice in just a few seconds. Many homes were damaged, and 2 were completely destroyed. The flow also affected roads and fields up to the confluence of the Rio Cassarot with the Pellice. Rescue operations began immediately from the civil hospital in Pinerolo using helicopters, ambulances, fire trucks, and police and finance guard vans. Their assistance was supported by bulldozers for earth removal, and the excavations lasted two days. About 300 people were evacuated as a precaution. There were also disruptions in various areas of the province of Turin where landslides were recorded in Ceresole Reale and Pont Canavese. On May 30, the events came to an end, although the morning was still affected by moderate rainfall, followed by a damage assessment, which amounted to about 5 million euros promptly allocated by the region."

The swollen waters flooded the Vistula Delta, the Old Town, the Granary Island, and Ołowianka on the Motława, the Main and Old Town, Lower Town, as well as the area of the present districts of Stogi, Olszynka, and New Port. This was the largest flood in the history of the city, which inundated 3/4 of the then area of Gdańsk and lasted almost 3 weeks (until April 28). Several dozen people died in it, and about 12,000 people lost their homes. The flood was commemorated, among other things, by plaques on the walls of the \"Panna\" granary on Ołowianka and the Kamienna Lock in Lower Town. To protect Gdańsk and the Vistula Delta from flooding, the Vistula Cut (7.1 km long) was built between 1891 and 1895, allowing for the quick drainage of floodwaters and ice from the Vistula River to the Baltic Sea via the shortest route."

At that time, a weak tremor was observed in Laza, and cracks formed in residential houses. On September 9, the villagers witnessed a strange natural phenomenon. Countless eagles were circling over the carcasses of sheep that had been trapped under a suddenly fallen rock. On September 10, the residents of Laza were awakened early in the morning by a terrible rumble and witnessed mud flowing from the waterfall in the village. As noted by scientists, after the rains on September 9-10, a landslide-flood process began here. The process started as a landslide and partially as a collapse after the rain, and the moving mass collected from the source of the Laza River into the beds of its tributaries. Moving from an altitude of 2400-2500 m, it entered the river valley. Here, large landslide masses turned into a stony-muddy flood with a small amount of water. Since this flood poured down like a waterfall from a height of 80-100 m, its speed increased. It spread to the sloping plain part of the Laza River valley. This lasted for one day. The mass brought by the flood caused the relief here to rise by 3-6 m. In a village consisting of 19 houses located at an altitude of 1650 m above sea level, 3 houses were submerged by the flood. Among the materials brought by the flood were rock fragments made of limestone, weighing between 5-6 tons and even reaching 15-20 tons. Scientists say that this type of landslide-flood flow is a rare occurrence in nature. The mud brought to Laza by the flood dried up after 3 years."

In early March, the rainfall intensified and the alert was extended to the province of Reggio Calabria, but the situation remained mostly stable until Saturday, March 11, when a statement from the civil protection was issued declaring the alert to be at the maximum level. In the early hours of Monday, March 13, 1995, the rainfall began to become very high: peaks of 224.6 mm to 253.6 mm were recorded. The sewers began to flood the streets of Acireale around 7:30 AM, while Giarre was declared flooded around 9:15 AM. In Calabria, the rainfall events affected the areas of the Ionian coast and Crotone, where rainfall peaks of 178 mm to 191.6 mm were recorded. Soon, storms, landslides, and some swollen streams emerged, interrupting communications and road traffic. In Acireale, two old buildings collapsed and some cars collided, while in Giarre a truck overturned, crushing two parked cars. Around 11:00 AM, the municipalities affected by the flood urged citizens to stay home and go out as little as possible. Numerous buildings were damaged, and in the countryside, many agricultural fields were destroyed by the violence of the water and the force of the wind. A total of 6 deaths were counted: 3 people died in Giarre swept away by the waters, 2 in Acireale drowned in their homes, and one in Mascali, carried away by the waters into a manhole. Additionally, the flood caused strong waves, which were the main cause of the tragedy involving the Greek ship Pelhunter: the ship, having left the port of Riposto around 7:45 PM, was suddenly caught by a strong wave while exiting the harbor, about 140 km from the coast, causing the immediate capsizing of the vessel, which had 15 people on board. Rescue operations, due to the extremely difficult communication situation, only began after 9:00 PM, and they were able to locate the ship only at night, given the sea conditions at that time. In the sinking of the Pelhunter, 5 people died, another 3 were rescued, while 7 people were never found and were effectively declared missing."

                "content": "The 2018 Shouguang flood refers to the flood disaster that occurred in Shouguang City, Weifang City, Shandong Province, China, from August 19 to 21, 2018, due to heavy rain and concentrated discharge from upstream reservoirs on the Mi River, causing flooding in the Shouguang section of the Mi River. From August 19 to 20, influenced by tropical storm Bebinca, the Mi River basin in Shandong experienced extremely heavy rainfall, leading to rising water levels in several reservoirs, including the Yeyuan Reservoir and the Tangshuiya Reservoir in Qingzhou and Linqu, prompting flood discharge from these reservoirs. Although the reservoirs provided some warning to downstream villagers, the time was only sufficient for residents to evacuate, and their livestock and property could not be relocated. This event resulted in the highest flood peak in the Shouguang section of the Mi River since 1974, with several villages along the Shouguang coast experiencing backflow from the river, causing significant damage to numerous homes, farmland, greenhouses, and breeding farms, and potentially leading to instability in vegetable supply to Beijing. During the same period as the Shouguang flood, there was a continuous rise in vegetable prices nationwide, which was reported by Xinhua News Agency. According to official statistics, by 5 PM on the 23rd, the disaster had caused 13 deaths, 3 missing persons, and the collapse of 9,999 houses, with economic losses estimated at about 9.2 billion yuan. Due to the number of collapsed houses exceeding 10,000, the government had to initiate a national level 4 response, and the figure of 9,999 collapsed houses was questioned as being too coincidental, with possible fabrication. Phoenix News published an article questioning the fact that \"9,999 houses were damaged in the Shouguang flood,\" citing data from the People's Daily client on August 23 stating \"10,335 houses collapsed, 8,240 houses severely damaged, and 53,465 houses generally damaged,\" after which the article was deleted."
