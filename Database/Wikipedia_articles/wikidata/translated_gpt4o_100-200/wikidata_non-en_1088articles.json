                "content": "The late August 2018 Taiwan heavy rain refers to the natural disaster caused by intense rainfall from August 23 to August 30, 2018, due to the convergence of a tropical depression and the southwest monsoon, as well as the subsequent development of a large low-pressure zone lingering over South China after the system dissipated, which brought further southwest airflow. Areas such as Yunlin, Chiayi, Nantou, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung experienced widespread flooding, with some localized areas remaining flooded for nearly a week. It was the most severe and prolonged catastrophic heavy rain to affect Taiwan since the Typhoon Morakot disaster. President Tsai Ing-wen of the Republic of China specifically instructed Presidential Office Secretary-General Chen Chu to stay in Kaohsiung to oversee disaster response efforts in southern Taiwan."

The Weather Bureau also continued to issue land strong wind warnings and heavy rain warnings for certain areas, reminding the public of potential landslides, falling rocks, debris flows, flash floods, and flooding before the southwesterly airflow affected Taiwan. The Weather Risk Management Development Company stated that compared to the impact of the previous tropical depression, the rainfall brought by this heavy rain event was relatively moderate. The Central Disaster Response Center, established in response to the tropical depression, was dismantled at 7 PM on the 25th and reopened three hours later to address this heavy rain event. Premier Lai Ching-te inspected the Central Disaster Response Center on the 28th and emphasized the importance of strengthening horizontal communication between ministries and vertical cooperation with local governments to help residents return home as soon as possible.  \n\nDue to the continued impact of heavy rain, the Central Weather Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation issued an extremely heavy rain warning for Pingtung County on the evening of the 27th and heavy rain warnings for Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Taitung County. The extremely heavy rain warning was extended to Kaohsiung City the following day. The Soil and Water Conservation Bureau of the Council of Agriculture also issued 42 red alerts for debris flows on the morning of the 28th, covering 6 townships and 15 villages in Kaohsiung and Pingtung, and 166 yellow alerts for areas including Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and Taitung. They stated that local governments should advise or force residents to evacuate and provide proper resettlement. The Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a level-one flood warning for 13 districts in Kaohsiung City and 5 townships in Pingtung County."

The Agriculture and Food Agency of the Council of Agriculture called on farmers to harvest crops that are ready for harvest in a timely manner to reduce losses. The Fisheries Agency of the Council of Agriculture also urged fishermen to take advantage of breaks in the rain to implement disaster prevention measures. The Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a Level 1 flood warning at 6:27 AM on the 28th for 13 districts in Kaohsiung City and 5 towns in Pingtung County.\n\nThe Xiaoliuqiu to Donggang ferry route was also affected by the heavy rain event, with reduced services on the 26th and suspension on the 27th. By noon on the 26th, a total of 2,500 people had rushed back to Donggang. Ferries from Taitung to Lanyu and Green Island were also suspended on the 27th, leaving nearly 4,000 tourists stranded. The Maritime and Port Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications stated that due to the heavy rain event, an estimated 58 ferry trips were canceled on the 28th.\n\nThe Southern Region Water Resources Office of the Water Resources Agency pointed out that in response to the second wave of heavy rain, Zengwen Reservoir and Mudan Reservoir were both subjected to regulated discharges on the morning of the 27th. It also stated that Agongdian Reservoir is currently in an empty reservoir period for sediment prevention. To prepare for the potential rainfall brought by this wave of heavy rain, the Southern Region Water Resources Office conducted regulated water releases to reserve flood detention space."

On the same day, Kaohsiung City also recorded over 300 millimeters of daily rainfall. The intense rainfall caused slippery roads in many areas, leading to multiple traffic accidents. In Xinyuan Township, Pingtung County, a car crashed into a utility pole, resulting in one death and three injuries. In Zhuqi Township, Chiayi County, a small car collision, possibly due to slippery roads and poor visibility caused by the rain, resulted in one death and one serious injury. On the 26th, the Pingtung County Police Department reported that a 64-year-old man went to Haishen Temple in Sandimen Township but was found missing after his car door was left open and the right rear wheel was stuck in the riverbed, marking the first missing person case in this heavy rain event.\n\nThe heavy rain also affected provincial highways. At the 260-kilometer mark of the Taiwan Route 17 in Qianzai Kou, water accumulation exceeded 20 centimeters and stretched over 100 meters. The Third Engineering Office of the Directorate General of Highways implemented road closures on the morning of the 26th. According to the Pingtung County Disaster Response Center, the Wutan section of Ping 106 in Taiwu Township was preemptively closed due to landslide risks. On the 1-kilometer mark of Route 200A in Manzhou Township, landslides obstructed road drainage, leading to controlled traffic. Additionally, the drainage system on the Fangliao section of Taiwan Route 1 was overwhelmed, causing about 20 centimeters of water accumulation on the road."

At the same time, it also became one of the counties and cities in the 2018 Republic of China local public office elections to stop accepting candidate registrations. This move was questioned by netizens regarding the standards for declaring a holiday in Pingtung County. Pingtung County Government Personnel Office Director Li Yin-ming emphasized that the weather forecast had reached the standard for suspending work and classes and stated that the top ten rainfall amounts on that day were all within Pingtung County. On the evening of the 27th, the Pingtung County Government announced that a landslide occurred in Shiwen Village and a collapse on County Road 146, causing traffic disruptions. Therefore, only Shiwen Village in Chunri Township, Pingtung County, would suspend work and classes on the 28th. The next day, heavy rain continued to fall in Pingtung County, with daily rainfall in several towns exceeding 200 millimeters. Severe traffic congestion occurred on the Linluo section of Provincial Highway 1 due to water accumulation, and flooding was reported on Guangfu Road near Pingtung Station and Fuxing South Road in Pingtung City, leading residents to question the county government's decision-making. Pingtung residents pointed out that the rainfall in Pingtung was no less than that in Kaohsiung, yet Pingtung County had normal work and classes on the 28th. They further stated that the Pingtung County Government should prioritize the safety of its residents. Pingtung County Government spokesperson Huang Jian-jia apologized in the afternoon, explaining that the rain was concentrated in a few towns and that widespread flooding had not occurred in the early morning."

However, netizens discovered that Acting Mayor Hsu Li-ming had mistakenly posted the quantitative precipitation forecast from the Weather Bureau and subsequently deleted the post. In response, the Kaohsiung City Government explained that the previous post was deleted due to an error and not intentionally removed. From the evening of the 27th to the early morning of the 28th, heavy rainfall continued in Kaohsiung City. The Kaohsiung Weather Station of the Weather Bureau also issued a late-night reminder that heavy rainfall radar echoes had entered the Kaohsiung area, urging the public to take disaster prevention measures. Acting Mayor Hsu Li-ming urgently announced at 6 a.m. on the 28th that work and classes would be suspended that day, prompting public outrage with comments such as \"You announce it after we've already left home\" and \"Can I call for a boat on Uber?\" This led to widespread dissatisfaction among the public. In response, Hsu Li-ming apologized on Facebook, while his staff noted that he had stayed up all night monitoring the flooding situation."

                "content": "On August 24, while the entire nation was busy with disaster relief, Vice President of the Republic of China, Chen Chien-jen, took his whole family to Kinmen for a three-day, two-night vacation, visiting major attractions in both Greater and Lesser Kinmen. He was accompanied by twelve bodyguards, and nearly twenty plainclothes police officers from the Kinmen County Police Bureau were deployed for full-time protection. This incident caused public criticism and negative perception, with Kinmen County legislator Yang Cheng-wu blasting, \"He doesn't come when he should, but comes when he shouldn't.\" Presidential Office spokesperson Alex Huang stated that as a member of the government team, causing negative public perception and criticism of the team, Vice President Chen expressed deep regret and apologized to the public. This incident was compared by the public to former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan getting a haircut before Typhoon Morakot and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Hsueh Hsiang-chuan eating sweet potato porridge with his father-in-law after overtime, which led to their resignations under heavy criticism from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), presenting a stark contrast.\n\nOn August 25, 2018, President Tsai Ing-wen of the Republic of China, accompanied by Chiayi County Magistrate Helen Chang, rode a Clouded Leopard armored vehicle to inspect Budai Township. Smiling, she encouraged disaster victims to stay strong. However, after traveling only about 50 meters, the vehicle was stopped by local residents who angrily shouted, \"If you drive further, just run me over!\" Kuomintang (KMT) spokesperson Hung Meng-kai harshly criticized on Facebook, calling it \"the most arrogant disaster inspection in history,\" and likened Tsai Ing-wen to a \"beauty queen on a parade float.\" Citizens also vented their anger on Facebook, saying, \"Disaster inspection? You won't even step into the water for a show. Riding a Clouded Leopard is bad enough, but can't you at least pretend to be solemn or reflective? What's with the smile? And waving? Are you here to thank voters or campaign? Are you sure you're not on the wrong set?\" Many public figures criticized the incident, with Chu Hsueh-heng condemning Tsai Ing-wen for smiling and waving from multiple angles and times, saying, \"Her smile sends chills down your spine.\" Chu remarked that Tsai used to hold others to strict standards, but now that she's being held to the same standards, it's only fair. \"If karma strikes, let it strike. Is it so hard not to have double standards?\" Hu You-wei commented that the incident occurred in Yong'an Village, symbolizing that Tsai can no longer \"be at peace forever.\" He humorously expressed Tsai's sentiments, saying, \"Whoever came up with the bad idea of having the emperor ride a Clouded Leopard armored vehicle for disaster inspection, send them to the Ministry of Punishments for 80 lashes and then to the labor camp to scrub toilets.\" Chang San-cheng pointed out, \"Because they can't feel empathy, the people have been soaking in water for days, and they hope high-ranking officials can understand their pain. But instead, they see President Tsai riding an armored vehicle, 'high above them'!\" He criticized Tsai for failing to \"share the people's suffering\" and lamented, \"With a president like this, I truly feel sorrow for our country.\"\n\nChiu Yi-ying criticized Kuomintang Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Han Kuo-yu for attending a campaign song release event for a city council candidate, saying, \"Kaohsiung people don't need a mayoral candidate like this!\" Subsequently, on August 26, Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker Tsai Chi-chang led legislators Lee Chun-yi, Ho Hsin-chun, Chiu Yi-ying, Lin Ching-yi, Lee Li-fen, Chou Chun-mi, and Chang Liao Wan-chien on a visit to Poland's parliament. This sparked controversy, as some questioned the appropriateness of the visit while flood disaster relief in affected areas was still incomplete.\n\nOn August 28, 2018, Legislative Yuan Speaker Su Jia-chyuan was spotted in Japan by the public, raising suspicions that he was on a leisure trip. Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia stated that Su was invited by the Japanese government for an official visit, accompanied by his wife. However, due to concerns about Taiwan's disaster situation, Su returned to Taiwan early that day."

The exceptional amount of rainfall caused rivers to flood instantly, water rose into houses, and cars were swept away. Several villages were isolated. According to France's flood monitoring agency Vigicrues, the country had not experienced such a severe flood since 1891. Heavy rains are common in the region in early autumn, but according to the French meteorological agency, the unusually high temperature of the Mediterranean may have intensified the rainfall.

                "content": "The persistence of adverse weather phenomena for several days, following which the Civil Protection of the Liguria region had already issued yellow and orange weather alert warnings for the respective basins, led the same body to declare a maximum alert level (red alert) for the entire day of Monday, October 29, 2018, for basins B, C, D, and E, corresponding to the Genoese Riviera, part of the western Riviera, the central inland region, and the entire eastern Riviera. For basin A, which includes the stretch of the western Riviera between Ventimiglia and Noli, the entire province of Imperia, and the Centa Valley, the alert remained at yellow and orange levels. In the preceding days, violent torrential rain affected almost the entire Ligurian territory, with significant short-term water accumulations recorded—especially in the Genoese hinterland (upper Scrivia Valley, Trebbia Valley, and Bisagno Valley), Chiavari area (Aveto Valley, Fontanabuona Valley, and Sturla Valley), and the Spezzino area (Cinque Terre and Vara Valley)—and landslides, mudslides, and flooding in various municipalities. In addition to the intense rainfall, another source of danger was the strong gusts of wind (in some measurements in the eastern Liguria exceeding 100-120 km/h and, in the west, up to 180 km/h, as recorded by sensors at the Loano Marina) and the resulting storm surges, which, fueled by the wind's force, affected the entire Ligurian coastline, especially in the Savona, Genoa, and Tigullio areas. The wind was the cause of the death of the only victim of the bad weather: an 88-year-old woman from Albisola Superiore, struck by parts of a roof and cornice blown into the street by the violent and sudden atmospheric phenomenon, who later died at the Savona hospital from the severe injuries sustained. The combined action of the wind gusts and the sea's wave motion caused the most significant damage on October 29 and 30, both in the public and private sectors, during the entire emergency phase of the meteorological event. Violent waves, some as high as 7-10 meters (the maximum height, measured by instruments at the Capo Mele buoy in the Savona area, was 10.31 meters), violently struck the Savona and Genoa coasts, causing the near-total destruction of existing beach establishments (structures, outdoor areas, piers) and the erasure of entire stretches of sandy and pebbly beaches. An initial assessment by the local Italian beach operators' union, in the hours following the storm surge on October 29, estimated that out of approximately 1,300 equipped Ligurian beach establishments, about 100 were completely destroyed, and about 400 were seriously damaged, with damages amounting to at least 50 million euros. In the municipality of Genoa, in addition to monitoring the main Bisagno and Polcevera streams (the latter being a special focus following the collapse of the Morandi Bridge just over two months earlier), the violent storm surge caused damage along the entire Genoese coastline, from Voltri to Nervi. There were collapses of some sections of the Anita Garibaldi promenade in Nervi and devastation in the fishing village of Boccadasse and the private and public infrastructures of the Sturla, Pegli, and Voltri districts, with damages estimated at around 8 million euros. The sea's force also struck port infrastructures: particularly affected were the public port of Santa Margherita Ligure and the international tourist port \"Carlo Riva\" in Rapallo, with the collapse of their respective breakwaters. The sudden collapse of some sections of the retaining walls caused a consequent vulnerability of the ports themselves, as well as the coastal stretch of the two cities in western Tigullio, with flooding and damage to seafronts and commercial activities located there. In Santa Margherita Ligure, after the collapse of about 10 meters of the breakwater in a section renovated and reinforced with works completed in 2014, damages were recorded to port services and the local Coast Guard barracks, the sinking of boats, and flooding of the main road along the marina. Towards Portofino, the sea's fury caused the complete collapse of a section of the provincial road 227 near the Paraggi hamlet and severe damage to the structure of the famous nightclub Covo di Nord-Est. The road's collapse isolated Portofino from Santa Margherita Ligure—SP 227 being the only drivable artery serving Portofino—making the municipality accessible only by sea, with the help of boats and vessels, or by land via trails and forest paths on the namesake promontory. To address the emergency situation, the Portofino Park Authority and the administrations of Portofino and Santa Margherita Ligure authorized the semi-drivable adaptation (for two-wheeled vehicles and emergency vehicles) of some pedestrian forest paths, particularly the section between Portofino Vetta and Portofino Mare and between the Nozarego hamlet in Santa Margherita and the Gassetta Mill (known as the Gave trail). This intervention, due to some techniques considered too cementitious, was later contested by some environmental associations, followed by actual checks by the forest police; at the end of November of the same year, the park authority also halted work on the trail for the adaptation of the other path towards Portofino. On the provincial road section between Santa Margherita Ligure and Paraggi, a temporary overhanging pedestrian walkway was built between late November and early December 2018, initially used exclusively by local residents and later, during the Christmas period, opened to all pedestrians. Among the damages recorded in Portofino, besides the collapse of part of the central and famous \"piazzetta\" and the problems in connections with the centers of Santa Margherita Ligure, Rapallo, and the Golfo Paradiso, there was an interruption of electricity and gas services in the days following the event. In nearby Rapallo, on the night between October 29 and 30, the collapse of the breakwater, reinforced and expanded during the 2000s after a similar but less violent atmospheric phenomenon, caused major damages, with the sinking of numerous boats in the area between the public and private ports and, with the breaking of various moorings, the escape of hundreds of boats and yachts from the \"Carlo Riva\" port, which, adrift and at the mercy of the sea's wave motion, sank in the Rapallo Gulf or ran aground on the Vittorio Veneto seafront embankment and other areas to the west (Lido area and Boate stream mouth) and east of the city (San Francesco stream mouth area, near the local sea castle, and Nagge area). On the same night, 20 boaters trapped in their vessels within the marina due to the sea's fury were rescued by fire brigade teams. The grounding of boats, some of considerable size and owned by prominent individuals, indirectly caused a massive media phenomenon due to the event's exceptional nature and scale, with footage and television reports from various national and international broadcasters. Due to the stranded boats, the city suffered damages to several private accommodation facilities along the seafront (damaged in several places) and especially to beach establishments, with the semi-destruction of fixed structures and piers. Along the seafront, there were several problems related to environmental factors, such as the possible fuel leakage from various boats (for which anti-pollution cloths were quickly installed around the vessels); a huge amount of plastic, wood, and mixed waste was carried by the waves and scattered along the entire coastline, even completely clogging the stormwater drains. Compared to nearby Santa Margherita Ligure, which suffered more damage to public assets, the Rapallo area experienced the highest number of damages in the private sector, with the international tourist port \"Carlo Riva\" being the most affected. The port infrastructure, built in the 1970s and the first private tourist port in Italy, estimated damages to the structure at 10-15 million euros, and in November, a judicial investigation was opened by the Genoa Prosecutor's Office to establish and ascertain any responsibilities. A similar case file was opened by the Genoese judiciary for the events related to the collapse of the breakwater of the public port in Santa Margherita. In total, about 300 boats, yachts, and vessels were damaged; as of November 15, about 130 had been removed, with complex and delicate operations on the seafront and marina. Within the Rapallo municipal territory, severe damages were also recorded in the marine hamlet of San Michele di Pagana, with the destruction of local beach establishments and various commercial and dining activities, damage to stretches of beach and cliffs, the collapse of the pier in front of the piazzetta, the collapse of a section of the coastal road to Rapallo near the Arches Beach, and the collapse of various portions of retaining walls of lands overlooking the sea and the coastal walkway connecting to the small inhabited nucleus of Prelo. Towards the east, further storm surge damages were recorded in Zoagli, with the collapse of some sections of the cliff (both east and west) and damage to commercial activities, and again in the eastern Tigullio area, with similar but less severe issues in Chiavari, Lavagna, Cavi di Lavagna, Sestri Levante, and Riva Trigoso. In the Spezzino Riviera, damages caused by wind and storm surges were recorded in Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Riomaggiore, Portovenere, and the provincial capital itself. In the Western Riviera, atmospheric phenomena affected the municipalities of Arenzano, Cogoleto, Celle Ligure, Albisola Marina, Savona, Bergeggi, Alassio, Finale Ligure, and other locations along the Savona coast. A similar situation also occurred in the province of Imperia, with damages recorded in the capital and Sanremo."

                "content": "The exceptional nature of the atmospheric event, especially due to the vastness of the affected area, inevitably caused significant monetary damage across all economic sectors and infrastructures, both public and private. An approximate calculation, revised multiple times by the various affected territories, led to an estimate of damages by the Chamber of Commerce of Genoa exceeding 100,000,000 euros in the municipalities of the Genoese province alone: 477 reports were filed by businesses and activities in 25 municipalities of the metropolitan city of Genoa, of which 117 were in Genoa itself (damages of about 33,400,000 euros), 73 in Rapallo (about 23,500,000 euros), and 61 in Santa Margherita Ligure (about 23,300,000 euros). In the Imperia area, the estimate was about 18,000,000 euros for the municipality of Imperia alone. In the province of Savona, the assessment mainly concerned damage to various beach establishments, with a total exceeding 30,000,000 euros, including volumetric and commercial value lost and necessary for restarting. To address the initial critical issues, in January 2019, the National Department of Civil Protection allocated 6,500,000 euros for initial emergency interventions, of which 2,700,000 euros were to cover expenses incurred by municipal entities for assistance interventions and the remaining 4,700,000 euros for the restoration and adjustment of roadways. Specifically, 57 municipalities were involved in the allocation of funding: 21 in the province of Savona, 15 in the province of Genoa, 14 in the province of La Spezia, and 7 in the province of Imperia. This amount was supplemented by an allocation of about 1,500,000 euros from the Liguria Region and an additional 8,000,000 euros allocated by the Stability Law for coastal defenses in Liguria."

Also, and unlike what happened in 2002, the 2010 flood did not result in any fatalities."

The storm caused a large number of city residents to be evacuated while streets, squares, and tunnels were flooded. The resulting mud rendered roads and commercial establishments inoperative, paralyzing part of the city's economic activity. The rain and wind storm collapsed the main roads and highways and kept the entire archipelago on orange alert. Just days later, on February 18, another storm, although less intense, caused a blackout that affected the entire island of Tenerife. A chain failure of the electrical groups in the island's two power plants occurred, resulting in what is technically known as a zero-energy event, meaning a total blackout due to the collapse of the supply. Five hours after the blackout, the power supply began to recover. This blackout was harshly criticized in the political arena, as it was considered unacceptable for a total blackout to occur on an island with more than 900,000 inhabitants."

The following day, the storm affected almost the entire Marche region, reaching Ascoli Piceno and part of Romagna (Ravenna), and in the evening in Casette d'Ete, a district of Sant'Elpidio a Mare, the overflow of the Ete Morto caused two fatalities: a car was swept away, a man and his daughter died while the wife survived and was found in a state of shock. On March 3, about 143 people were evacuated, the majority in Casette d'Ete, the area most affected by the flood. In Venarotta (Ascoli Piceno), a woman died in a flooded ditch. Rivers and streams overflowed: Ete Vivo, Tronto, Aso, Menocchia, Misa, Esino, Nevola, and Musone. In Cervia, two people died in a car while passing through a flooded underpass. Bora winds, storms, and heavy snowfall in the Umbria-Marche area further complicated communications. For example, the Adriatic state road 16 was covered in mud. In Forlì, schools were closed, and the Ancona-Falconara airport was shut down as a precaution.

                "content": "As the cause of the flood, mass media and specialists point to torrential and heavy rains. Particularly in focus is the flooding of the Iya River located in the Tulun region. Over three days, from June 25 to 27, record amounts of precipitation were recorded in this area, exceeding the monthly average precipitation by 3.7 times. The cause of the catastrophic precipitation is a weather anomaly observed against the backdrop of global and regional climate changes. The Irkutsk region has also become a focal point of such changes. Employees of the Hydrometeorology and Active Influence on Atmospheric Phenomena Service concluded that an exceptional situation occurred in the western regions of the Irkutsk region due to the simultaneous interaction of three air masses. Since the rise in river levels usually occurs on June 25-26, this period coincided this year with storms characteristic of a tropical cyclone, which involve a greater influx of heat and moisture from the Pacific Ocean. Under conditions of non-uniform terrain, such heat and moisture led to cloudiness and corresponding precipitation. Although initially, the hypothesis circulated that the presence of the Angara Cascade Hydroelectric Power Station contributed to the emergence of such a large amount of precipitation, this hypothesis was later refuted[2]."

Thus, a significant percentage of the urban area developed on the periphery of the original settlement, creating populous and densely populated neighborhoods. After several decades, the inhabitants and rulers believed they were completely safe, thinking that nothing and no one could devastate the already established urban area. They began \"reclaiming\" land from the river by partially filling in coastal areas, altering the ecosystem, destroying forests, degrading the soil, and building houses and factories in risk-prone zones. Large projects were also planned, such as a Coastal Avenue. However, these were nothing more than simple political promises. At that time, the floods of the Paraguay River were rare, weak, and manageable. The inhabitants knew how far the water would reach during each event. But during the 1960s and 1970s, the floods became characterized by greater frequency, longer duration, and increasingly significant hydrometric readings. By 1979, with a maximum height of 8.32 meters, the Paraguay River caused significant losses and thousands of evacuations, serving as a sort of warning of what was to come. After these inconveniences, settlements near the riverbanks were reestablished, believing it would not happen again. By July 1982, a new river flood raised the waters to 8.68 meters, surpassing the 1979 mark, causing millions of pesos in losses and affecting more than 18,000 people, marking the beginning of what would become the greatest flood of the century recorded in the Argentine littoral. From then on, the water remained stagnant, rising and falling but always within normal parameters."

The provinces of Santa Fe, Misiones, Corrientes, and Chaco had already been in a state of emergency for almost a month, and even the Barranqueras port had disappeared under the ever-rising waters. As the situation became uncontrollable, Formosa was declared in a state of emergency; the Paraguay River had surpassed 9 meters, and the disaster began to worsen, first in the island and riverside areas, and then in the peripheral neighborhoods of the capital and nearby towns, threateningly surrounding populated centers without defenses or adequate resources to face such an overflow. Then, everything turned to outrage and sadness. The waters had already devastated towns like Clorinda and Herradura, cut off roads and highways, and were still advancing. In response, both in the capital and in Clorinda, desperate construction of coastal defense works began, surrounding the urban core, built on the highest perimeters with compacted soil brought in by trucks operating tirelessly and piled up by road machinery, forming a containment barrier. This grueling effort involved the movement of 340 trucks and 119 heavy equipment units between the two cities, the transport of over 1,000,000 cubic meters of soil, and the tireless and selfless work of thousands of anonymous hands who reinforced the embankments day and night with sandbags, driving stakes, and fighting to save what belonged to everyone. But the river kept rising, advancing past the 10-meter mark with no intention of stopping. At the local port, activity was relentless; thousands of evacuated families with the few belongings they could salvage were assisted by every available vessel, such as the sand dredger Capri VI, which made tireless trips transporting populations from nearby areas like Alberdi in Paraguay and the most affected island sectors, or the Navy ship 'Piloto Alsina,' which served as shelter and assistance for hundreds of affected families. On May 31, 1983, the river reached its maximum level: 10.73 meters, plunging the city of Formosa into the worst chaos: schools turned into evacuation centers, classes suspended, basic services provided inadequately, supermarkets out of stock, businesses closing, producers losing everything, and more than 10,000 Formosa residents deciding to leave a province that suddenly frightened them. But many stayed; they helped distribute food, clothing, and medicine among the more than 75 evacuation centers scattered throughout the city, to reinforce hope in the containment barriers, to collaborate with Civil Defense, the Red Cross, the Coast Guard, the Air Force, the Army, and the Gendarmerie in whatever was necessary, to try to save what belonged to them and fight to the end in a sort of personal battle to avenge the misfortune of nearly 70,000 people affected by the waters of a river that showed no mercy, that was relentless, and that exacted a heavy toll for human recklessness. By mid-June, the water began its steady retreat; it had calmed down and finally gave up. It left behind desolation, sadness, lost dreams, and for many, an inevitable need to start over; it also left in memory the recollection of the solidarity of a community that decided not to give up and fought to save their belongings and their dignity."

Partly caused by nature, the negligence of citizens and authorities has also played an important role. León was founded and has grown on almost flat terrain that hardly allows for the rapid drainage of water that comes from higher areas after heavy rains. This excess water, which the rivers crossing the city cannot drain, spills over the urban area and causes catastrophic floods, large and with strong currents. In the early hours of June 23, 1926, much of the population was sleeping peacefully when they were awakened by street cries and police whistles warning of the danger looming over the city: the Río de Los Gómez was overflowing on 5 de Mayo Street! At dawn, the El Muerto stream also began to spill over the town of El Coecillo, collapsing fragile adobe houses and killing their occupants. To make matters worse, at nine in the morning, a second, more violent current followed, caused by the destruction of the dam wall of the Hacienda de Arriba.\n\nThe bells of the temples rang furiously, warning people to flee, but upon leaving their homes, they found that the streets had turned into rushing torrents that inexorably rose in level, sweeping everything in their path. The current flowed past the facades, carrying furniture, mattresses, clothes, and a few human and animal corpses in its wake. With difficulty, people began to cross the streets, clinging to doors, window bars, or lampposts, carrying their youngest children and some of their most precious belongings on their backs.\n\nMost tried to reach high places like Bellavista and the hills of La Soledad or El Santuario, while others found refuge in the Teatro Doblado, the Seminary, the Municipal Palace, the Reforma Bullring, and even the Modelo School, Círculo Leonés Mutualista, and private homes."

This committee was chaired by Don Enrique Aranda. The reconstruction of the city took place during difficult times, as the Mexican Revolution had just ended, but what would become the Cristero War was already brewing. Many families emigrated, and those who stayed had to face the misery caused by the catastrophe. Even today, León is crossed by numerous rivers, streams, and canals, so floods remain a daily occurrence: We must not forget that waters always find and follow their path."

With the distribution of Malaga's lands carried out after the Christian conquest of Málaga, the forests of the Montes de Málaga began to be cut down, and the lands were cleared for vine cultivation, leaving the city, located at the end of a steep valley at the mouth of the Guadalmedina, defenseless against storms.

The sudden increase in water flow caused the river to overflow, quickly flooding the neighborhoods of El Perchel and La Trinidad and many other low-lying areas of the city. During the catastrophe, twenty-one people drowned, and many others were injured. The waters reached up to five meters in height, and according to witnesses, the amount of mud and debris was such that it was possible to access some houses through the balconies.

                "content": "Alfonso XIII ordered that, with the utmost urgency, the necessary works be carried out to prevent the recurrence of floods in Málaga. In 1908, the Málaga-born engineer Manuel Jiménez Lombardo presented the project for the construction of the Agujero dam to the Hydraulic Division of Southern Spain. The dam would retain the waters of the large autumn floods of the Guadalmedina, storing approximately 4.5 cubic hectometers, which would gradually be released through a tunnel with a capacity of 360 m³ and outlets of 60 m³/second. Likewise, given the scale of the catastrophe and also in gratitude for the behavior of the city of Málaga during the shipwreck of the frigate SMS Gneisenau, the German government gifted the city the Puente de los Alemanes (Bridge of the Germans), inaugurated in 1909. The Agujero dam, although efficient in its limited function, could not be the ultimate solution to the flood problem, as hydrological studies of the basin showed that it did not fully guarantee the city's safety. After decades of discussions and debates between supporters of solutions based solely on hydraulic works—civil engineers—and supporters of hydrological-forestry restoration—forestry engineers—the reforestation of the river basin was undertaken, accompanied by the construction of sediment retention dikes. In 1919, José Almagro San Martín, a forestry engineer from the 7th Hydrological-Forestry Division, completed the drafting of the \"Project for the Correction of the Guadalmedina Basin.\" Its execution began in 1929 with the arrival in the city of another forestry engineer, José Martínez Falero. Nearly 5,000 hectares on the left bank of the river were expropriated and reforested, and 30 hydraulic masonry dikes were built. Colonizing species such as Aleppo pine and stone pine were used, effectively fulfilling the protective and restorative objective for the basin's soils, forming the forest mass of the Montes de Málaga natural park. Years later, in 1983, 2.5 km downstream from El Agujero, the El Limonero reservoir was built with a capacity of 25 cubic hectometers, rendering the old El Agujero reservoir obsolete—today its gates and spillways are out of use, though operational, as the Limonero dam is located further downstream—and, together with the aforementioned reforestation measures, solved the severe floods that Málaga had historically faced. The last governmental initiative aimed at increasing the forested area of the Guadalmedina basin was carried out by the Málaga City Council in 2002, with the expropriation of nearly 400 hectares on the right bank, which were reforested in collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment."

On October 19, 151.5 mm were recorded in Vélez Rubio and 95.6 mm in Puerto Lumbreras, with maximum rainfall in the part of the Almería province within the Segura basin reaching 300 mm in less than two hours. With such intense rainfall, combined with the lack of vegetation cover, the main basins in the area overflowed. In the province of Almería, the main receiving basins recorded more than 600 million m³, and in some areas, the waters exceeded 15 meters in height. However, it was in the Region of Murcia where the flood was most severe. In Lorca, a flow rate of over 2500 m³/s was recorded in the Guadalentín. In Puerto Lumbreras, the Nogalte ravine reached 1,974 m³/s, of which 814 m³/s were solid flow and 1,160 m³/s were liquid flow, with a specific flow of 14,200 l/s/km². The sediment accounted for 41.18% of the total flow, 70.02% of the liquid flow, a very high figure when similar basins typically accepted values of 40 to 50%.[2] Successive floods were caused by continuous blockages-unblockages and landslides of tons of soil upstream of the channel. Notably, in just two hours, 12 hm³ of water and 8,000 m² of solid material passed through this town, destroying everything in their path.[1]"

In the province of Granada, in the town of La Rábita, the bridge passing directly above the urban center was blocked. This created a dam that, upon breaking, released a massive amount of water and tons of accumulated sediment, destroying dozens of houses and causing the death of more than fifty people. In Lorca, 13 people died, while in Puerto Lumbreras, which was the hardest hit, the total number rose to 89. The flood destroyed 3 km of the national road to Murcia, overflowing the bridge over the dry riverbed, which has a height of over 8 meters. In a letter sent three days after the disaster by the Mayor to the Minister of Finance, it was reported that almost all municipal services had disappeared, such as the Market Square, the Municipal Slaughterhouse, the Potable Water Pumping Station, the Weighbridge, or the Fountain, watering trough, and washing area of Los Caños. In the rest of the region, the waters of the Guadalentín River, to which the Nogalte dry riverbed is a tributary, in turn flooded the Segura River, of which it is a tributary, affecting large depressions in Sangonera la Verde, much of the Murcia orchard, and the Vega Baja."

The Tormes River, being one of them, experiences an uncontrolled and sudden increase in flow that occurs within a short interval of less than five hours during the night of January 26-27 (the feast day of Saint Polycarp). This sudden flood causes numerous damages and deaths in the city’s plain, remaining in history as the so-called Night of Saint Polycarp. In the flood, 142 people who were caught off guard during the night died. The churches located in the river plain were seriously affected. The Roman bridge crossing the river suffered severe damage, requiring significant restoration. Four arches on the side farthest from the city completely collapsed, leaving the city cut off on that side; in the following days, more arches collapsed until stopping at the central tower. The bridge was rebuilt starting in 1627, during the reign of Philip IV. The rains caused another flood in February of the same year but with lesser consequences."

In some localities, the rainfall reached a total of 1000 mm from October 19 to 21. However, the magnitude of the disaster was multiplied when, at 7:15 PM on October 20, after several hours during which the Tous dam overflowed from the top, it broke. The collapse of the Tous dam caused a flood in the Xúquer River of 16,000 m³/s, even greater than that of 1864, and devastated the regions of Ribera Alta and Ribera Baixa, especially towns such as Sumacàrcer, Gavarda, Beneixida, Alberic, Carcaixent, and Algemesí. The flooded area covered 290 km². The A-7 highway and the railway line from Silla to Gandia also played an important role in retaining the waters. According to official figures, 8 people died (40 people according to other sources), and approximately 300,000 people were left homeless in the following days. Many homes were permanently lost. Furthermore, towns like Gavarda and Beneixida were relocated in the following years (although some residents tried to rebuild their homes in their original locations). The damages exceeded 60 billion pesetas, only in the province of Valencia.\n\nThe affected people opted for various means to seek financial compensation. Some of them, who chose the judicial route, waited in courts for more than twenty years to receive their compensations. Physicist Fernando Senent Pérez conducted a study on the effect of the flood on radioactivity and concluded that it did not cause any significant changes despite the operation of the Cofrents Nuclear Power Plant. The Tous flood has been one of the greatest catastrophes in the modern history of the Valencian Community, comparable, perhaps, to the Great Flood of Valencia and the DANA of 2024."

The establishment of the São Sebastião Farm, also known as the English Farm, in 1927, dedicated to banana and citrus cultivation, was followed by the development of an extensive railway network, which reached 120 kilometers of expansion with 40 branches. The English Farm was located in the Juqueriquerê River basin and significantly altered the natural drainage and water flow conditions of the region. In the 1960 demographic census, the city already had 9,819 inhabitants, 4,655 of whom lived in the urban area. Combined with accelerated anthropization, the natural configurations of the municipality contribute to the risk of landslides. Situated between the Atlantic Ocean and the Serra do Mar, Caraguatatuba extends along the slopes of that mountain range, which in some sections have gradients exceeding 40%, causing instability and tending to facilitate mass movements. The meteorological conditions of the northern coast are also sensitive to extreme events, as it is a region with high rainfall, varying between monthly averages of 41 mm (August) to 210 mm (January). According to newspapers, it had been raining intensely since March 16, 1967, with the rain intensifying at night. The intense precipitation was a consequence of a precipitation anomaly in Brazil that month, related to frontal systems and the orographic conditions of the region. The month of March had been marked by daily rains, which intensified on the 17th and 18th. According to the English Farm station, the rainfall index for March was 851 mm, with 420 mm on the 18th alone, with no higher index recorded due to the saturation of the rain gauge."

At 1:00 PM, an avalanche of rocks, trees, and mud occurred from the Cruzeiro, Jaraguá, and Jaraguazinho hills near the city. Loud noises were heard by the population, but since visibility was impaired by the rain (estimated to be only 20 meters), it was not possible to assess the city's situation at that time. Around 3:30 PM, mass landslides occurred, and the city became isolated. The Tamoios Highway was destroyed, and several cars were trapped in the mountainous section. Access to Ubatuba and São Sebastião, neighboring cities, was blocked, and help could only arrive by sea and air. The Santo Antônio River increased its width from 40 to 200 meters. The mud flowed along with the river. At 4:30 PM, another front opened in the Santo Antônio River valley. In the Rio do Ouro neighborhood, gigantic barriers began to fall in the morning, forming a massive dam that broke a few hours later, wiping out the neighborhood and displacing the main bridge of that river. If the dam had not broken, the entire city would have been flooded and covered by water. As a result, the mountain road was mostly destroyed, making it impossible to recognize its former path in many sections, where cliffs over 100 meters deep formed. The Ubatuba Road suffered landslides in the sections of Maranduba, Getuba, Sumaré, Prainha, and Martim de Sá, covering the road with 80 centimeters of mud. There was a power outage for three days. The official death toll was 436. However, according to residents, the number was higher, with many bodies carried away by the sea or never found under the mud. Due to the scale of the disaster, it became difficult to determine the number of missing people, as those who could report others missing were also simultaneously unaccounted for. Due to the damage to agriculture and the economic decline observed since World War II, the Fazenda dos Ingleses ceased its activities after the 1967 flood."

The landslide was so massive that it dammed the entire river. It carried away fields, trees, meadows, forests, and houses, and it also caused enormous flood waves that swept away people and buildings along the river. Various sources state that between 85 and 127 people perished in the natural disaster. The catastrophe affected both sides of the river, which at the time had a Norwegian and a Swedish side. The location of the landslide was near the villages of Intagan and Åkerström. According to the clergyman Torsten Wassenius in Vassända, the event occurred on October 6, 1648, around 2:00 PM – although some sources claim it was on October 7. The landslide was described as \"a great landslide of 27 alnar\" and began at a farm located on the then Norwegian side, near Intagan – then called \"Intaka.\" It was mostly meadows, fields, and farms that were swept away in the collapse, and some large boathouses also disappeared in the masses of debris. The boathouses floated upstream a bit toward Trollhättan after the landslide. The water sought a new path following the landslide and temporarily flowed over the lands of Åkerström and Intagan. Only after 27 days did the river regain its former appearance. Even today, one can see a roughly 200-meter-long remnant of the large piece of land that collapsed on the shore below Stubbered on the other side of the river. Norway attempted to claim this small strip of land in 1649. However, it was only nine years until the Treaty of Roskilde, when the area ceased to be a border region between Norway and Sweden."

On the night of November 23, 2000, the protective embankments holding back the water masses were close to breaking in Arvika, but the local rescue service still did not want to call the area a \"disaster zone.\" There were also fears that the Carl Larsson house would be affected."

After almost continuous rain for several weeks, the peak came on December 12 when more than 300 millimeters of rain had already fallen. This is normally the amount for two whole months under usual circumstances. Kållered shopping area was completely or partially underwater, and the Mölndal River was several meters above its banks all the way from Mölndal to its mouth in Gothenburg. In the Gothenburg area, it was primarily Härryda, Mölndal, Lerum, Partille, and central Gothenburg that were affected by extensive flooding from the Mölndal River and Säve River. However, severe flooding also occurred in other locations, such as Kungsbacka, which was flooded by the Kungsbacka River, Horred by the Viskan River, and Svenljunga and Falkenberg by the Ätran River. In central Gothenburg and Mölndal, much of the car and tram traffic came to a halt. Organizers were also forced to cancel the match between Gais and Helsingborgs IF at Gamla Ullevi. The following year, 2007, work was carried out to prevent similar rainstorms from causing similar problems in the future. Among other measures, the Mölndal River was dredged and widened."

                "content": "On August 6, 1959, a tropical depression formed over the sea near Dongsha Island and moved northeastward, gradually approaching Taiwan, but it did not further develop into a tropical storm. On August 7, Typhoon Ellen over the southern seas of Japan, influenced by the Fujiwhara effect, drew the tropical depression near Dongsha Island (081) into Taiwan. At 5 p.m. on August 7, the tropical depression made landfall in Budai Township, Chiayi County. After landfall, it gradually weakened due to the influence of the terrain and dissipated near Puli Township due to the obstruction of the Central Mountain Range. A secondary low-pressure system was induced between Hualien and Xincheng on the eastern side of the Central Mountain Range, which continued to move north-northeastward. During its movement over Taiwan, this tropical depression caused extremely unstable weather in central and southern Taiwan, forming a strong southwest airflow and triggering torrential rain.  \n\nThe heavy rain began around 6 p.m. on August 7 and eased by the afternoon of August 8. The southwestern slopes of the central and southern mountainous regions and the adjacent western plains recorded rainfall exceeding 500 millimeters. From August 7 to 9, the cumulative rainfall in central and southern Taiwan reached 800 to 1,200 millimeters over three consecutive days—particularly on August 7, when the daily rainfall reached 500 to 1,000 millimeters, nearly equivalent to the average annual rainfall. There were 15 locations where daily rainfall exceeded 500 millimeters. The main centers of heavy rain were concentrated in Miaoli, Fengyuan, Fenyuan, the upper reaches of the Wu River, Douliu, and Alishan.  \n\nDue to the difficulty in draining surface water and the occurrence of flash floods, river levels rose and breached embankments. The flooding destroyed houses and farmland, resulting in an unprecedented flood disaster. The affected areas included all agricultural regions of Taiwan, with extremely severe damage."

Among these, the Dadu River (Wu River) basin experienced heavy rainfall in its upstream tributaries on the evening of the 7th, causing the river to rise rapidly. Floodwaters surged southward, but due to the narrow waterway near the Changhua Railway Bridge, the water could not be discharged in time. This resulted in the left bank of the Dadu River being breached for 1,102 meters, flooding Changhua City, Hemei Township, and Shengang Township, making them the areas with the most severe damage. On the morning of the 8th, floodwaters entered Changhua City, reaching their peak at noon with a depth of up to 3 meters in the shallowest areas. The floodwaters began to recede afterward, with the city area clearing by the morning of the 9th, while the suburban areas remained flooded until the afternoon of the 9th.\n\nThe upstream area of the Beigang River received the highest rainfall during the August 7 Flood, causing the river to overflow and breach its embankments, flooding areas such as Huwei, Douliu, Dapi, Douliu, Tuku, and Beigang, resulting in severe damage. In Miaoli County, the Tana River experienced a sudden rise in water levels on the morning of the 8th, breaching the Wuhu embankment and turning Xihu Township into a vast expanse of water. In the southern region, rivers such as the Bajhang River, Jishui River, Zengwen River, and Yanshui River also overflowed their embankments, causing widespread flooding in areas such as Shuishang Township, Yanshui Township, Xuejia Township, Madou Township, Xinshi Township, Yongkang Township, and parts of Tainan City.\n\nThe actual disaster area covered 1,365 square kilometers, affecting over 300,000 residents. The death toll reached 667, with 408 missing and 942 injured. A total of 27,466 houses were completely destroyed, and 18,303 were partially destroyed. Transportation and communication in the disaster areas were almost entirely cut off, with over 130,000 hectares of farmland damaged. The total loss was estimated at NT$3.7 billion, accounting for approximately 12% of the previous year's gross national income."

A few days later, Washington ordered the helicopter carrier USS Thetis Bay (CVE-90) to redirect from Hong Kong waters, carrying 21 Sikorsky H-34 helicopters from the U.S. Marine Corps HMR(L)-261 squadron to Taiwan for disaster relief.

Floodwaters descended from the mountain to the harbor, sweeping away and crushing many people and vehicles parked on the street. The rain also eroded steep slopes, causing landslides and mudflows. One of the power plants and water pumps on Hong Kong Island was damaged by the flooding, leading to the suspension of water and electricity supply in some parts of the island. In the Aberdeen area alone, there were 1,200 victims. In the New Territories, particularly in Tai Po and Yuen Long, farmland was severely damaged, including 95% of the rice fields in the former district, according to newspapers. In total, the severe weather caused 64 deaths and over 6,000 victims."

Starting April 1, this closed center moved very slowly from west to east over the center of the country. This low-pressure center created favorable conditions for widespread upward movements in the central-east of Argentina, a necessary condition for cloud formation. On April 2, the development of an incipient frontal wave located in the west of Buenos Aires province, combined with a 1023hPa anticyclone located southeast of Mar del Plata, generated intense and persistent northeast quadrant winds over the east of the province. This condition favored the entry of humid air into the region affected by intense rainfall, evidenced by the sustained increase in water vapor content, which reached maximum values of between 40 and 45 mm in Ezeiza in the early hours of April 2. The emagrams obtained through a radiosonde showed a vertical wind profile from the northeast quadrant in a thickness of approximately 1500 m in height, which extended to greater heights on April 1."

One of the cells also generated a tornado near the town of Ensenada. Between 5:00 PM and 5:10 PM HOA, an initial storm cell reached the city of La Plata, remaining in that area for approximately one hour. At the same time, successive images show that the storm cells did not display significant movement, suggesting that they were continuously regenerating over the same area, thereby favoring the persistence of rainfall in that region. Although the area affected by the most intense precipitation (according to radar information) extended in a north-south orientation from the boundary between Berisso and Ensenada towards the La Plata district, around 8:00 PM HOA, a fairly intense storm cell developed over the city of La Plata, remaining there for approximately two hours (until 10:00 PM HOA). Subsequently, the entire area of bad weather began to move eastward, towards the Río de la Plata."

                "content": "The architect Roberto Livingston and the environmentalist Osvaldo Guerrica Echevarría pointed to design errors and climate change as the main causes of the floods. There is a theory that the Buenos Aires/La Plata Highway was, in part, a cause of the flooding, as it did not have the necessary number of bridges for proper water drainage, an issue that had been raised but not taken into account during its construction. This deficiency would have left the El Gato stream as the only drainage channel. Thus, the specific observed causes would be: In 2007, a report from the Department of Hydraulics of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of La Plata had identified drainage problems in the El Gato stream basin. It had also warned about the need to address the overflow of the reservoirs on Avenida 32, which, during heavy rains, expelled water instead of retaining it. An underlying issue would be the disorganized demographic growth of real estate in La Plata over the last ten years, which led to the disappearance of large green spaces, historic buildings, and diagonals. It was estimated that more than 800,000 square meters were built between 2003 and 2008, while one million square meters were constructed in the two years prior to the flood. It was also considered that the 2009 Urban Planning Code of La Plata allowed for the construction of more towers in the central area, which may have exacerbated the flooding. Additionally, there is an investigation against the YPF refinery in Ensenada due to an accusation claiming that the closure of a canal gate, carried out to combat a fire caused by the storm, was the main cause of the flooding. The report from the Department of Hydraulics of the Faculty of Engineering of the National University of La Plata states that the hydraulic infrastructure works were not prepared for the event, that the meteorological alert was not issued in time, and that the actions taken by public officials were late, insufficient, and chaotic. The Municipality of La Plata is responsible for the stormwater drainage conduits. Furthermore, the Municipal Emergency Committee has an Emergency Protocol for events like this that should have been activated."

The main focus of the storm occurred between 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM that day. It was not until a year later that the Justice system managed to establish the number of fatalities caused by the tragedy. The death toll was 89, 70 percent of whom were over 65 years old. The investigation conducted by the Administrative Litigation Judge of La Plata, Luis Arias, opened the possibility that another 16 people may have died during the storm, although the number could not be conclusively proven. The aforementioned magistrate also ordered the adaptation of death registration procedures, the relocation of people living on the banks of the Del Gato and Maldonado streams, as well as the suspension of real estate developments, among other causes that generated unrest in political and business circles. The Administrative Litigation Judge of La Plata, Luis Arias, was later suspended and removed by a jury initiated during the government of María Eugenia Vidal. The magistrate received support from political, social, and human rights organizations. In fact, the Tolosa Flood Victims Assembly expressed its support for Arias for \"promoting a thorough investigation into the number of deaths caused by the flood.\" Neither Governor Scioli nor Mayor Bruera (the latter with an embarrassing attempt to conceal his vacation in Brazil) were even questioned about these events. The criminal proceedings for the floods in La Plata concluded with a single accused, Sergio Ariel Lezana, a Civil Defense official of that city, who accepted his guilt and requested the maximum penalty for the crime of \"failure to fulfill the duties of a public official.\" Thus, the penalty was established as a payment of $12,500 and a one-year disqualification from holding public office. Lezana was the first official to undergo an oral and public trial for the flood and was to be tried jointly with the provincial Civil Defense chief, Miguel Ángel Di Lorenzo, but the latter passed away months before the trial."

According to a preliminary report conducted in the municipality of La Plata, 58,582 properties were affected by the rains. Of the total affected properties, 55,716 correspond to homes, while 2,846 are businesses and garages. It is estimated that 25% of La Plata residents were directly affected by the catastrophe, while the figure exceeds 55% of the party's population if those who lost a car or suffered other types of damages are considered. Following the flood, a hydraulic works plan was launched to double the drainage system of the entire Buenos Aires capital region (La Plata, Berisso, and Ensenada). The plan is implemented through the Directorate of Hydraulic Works, which will require an investment of about $2 billion by the province—largely financed by the national government—and will be carried out in parallel stages, where one of the main objectives is to widen the channel of the El Gato stream, which receives 70% of the water that drains in the capital region—carrying all the water from the urban area as well as that from the Regimiento and Pérez streams—and discharges it into the Río de la Plata."

In the center of La Plata, a mobile water purification plant with a capacity of 2,000 liters of water per hour was installed, supported by a sachet packaging machine. The 601st Engineer Battalion, the 601st Air Assault Regiment, the Buenos Aires Military Garrison Command, the National Military College, the Army Non-Commissioned Officers School \"Sargento Cabral,\" the 1st Infantry Regiment, and the 601st Military Police Company were added to the tasks, which also came to include the loading, transportation, and delivery of supplies in more than 80 mobilized trucks. The overflow in logistics centers due to the large number of donations led the 601st Communications Group to operate as a receiver of items contributed by society, to which the 7th Mechanized Infantry Regiment had to add its facilities days later. The National Military College provided 60 health cadets to the health centers involved in the assistance tasks.

Consequently, the Abukuma River and its tributaries overflowed, causing damage to municipalities along the Abukuma River, including Fukushima City. This led to 11 casualties and damage to 14,000 buildings. The 24-hour rainfall observed at the Fukushima Local Meteorological Observatory (Fukushima City) and the Onahama Weather Station (Iwaki City) broke historical records.  \n\nIn Fukushima City, significant flooding occurred in Minamimachi near the confluence of the Abukuma River and Arakawa River due to a levee breach, submerging the first floors of buildings completely. In the northern part of Fukushima City, at Iizaka Onsen, the Surikami River, which flows through the center of the hot spring town, overflowed, flooding inns and dealing a severe blow to the summer tourist season.  \n\nIn Yanagawa Town, Date District (now Yanagawa area of Date City) in northern Nakadori, as well as Kakuda City and Marumori Town in Igu District, Miyagi Prefecture, damage such as river flooding and inundation was reported. In Koriyama City in central Nakadori, the central industrial complex was flooded, with precision electronics factories submerged and other factories also affected, resulting in damages of 30 billion yen in this industrial complex alone. Including other sectors, the total damage amounted to over 108.5 billion yen.  \n\nIn Fukushima Prefecture, there were three fatalities: one in Iwashiro Town, Adachi District (now Nihonmatsu City), and two in Koriyama City."

As of September 9, the damage in Gifu Prefecture included 3 injuries, 2 completely destroyed houses, 2 partially destroyed houses, 653 cases of above-floor flooding, 4,711 cases of below-floor flooding, 61 landslides, and 17 road damages (according to the evening edition of the Gifu Nichinichi Shimbun on September 9). On September 9, Gifu Prefecture established a disaster response headquarters with Governor Saburo Hirano as the head under the Fire and Disaster Management Division. Additionally, Gifu City and Takami Town in Yamagata District were covered under the Disaster Relief Act. Although the advisory was downgraded to a heavy rain and flood advisory at 5:20 p.m., heavy rain resumed from midnight, and a heavy rain and flood warning was issued at 9:40 p.m. On the morning of the 10th, the rain temporarily subsided, and a heavy rain and flood advisory was issued at 1:40 p.m., but intermittent torrential rain resumed in the afternoon, and a heavy rain and flood warning was issued at 9:35 p.m. The rise in the Nagara River was particularly severe, recording a water level of 7.3 meters in Sunomata Town, Ampachi District, at 9:00 a.m. on the 9th. The water level temporarily dropped on the 10th. On September 11, as the damage further expanded due to the overflow of small and medium-sized rivers, dike breaches, and the isolation of areas caused by rising water, the Self-Defense Forces were requested for the first disaster dispatch at 8:30 a.m. based on a request from Gifu City, and the 10th Division of the Ground Self-Defense Force from Moriyama Garrison was dispatched. They were also dispatched to one city, two towns, and one village, including Ogaki City, to conduct rescue operations and recovery work. At this point, the damage in Gifu Prefecture extended to 10 cities, 36 towns, and 18 villages. The water level of the Nagara River in Sunomata Town reached 7.15 meters again at 2:00 p.m. on the 11th. In Gifu City, the Kagamishima area downstream of Chusetsu Bridge was in a dangerous state, and strict vigilance was enforced."

At 7:30 a.m. on the same day, a crack was found in the embankment of the Nagara River in Omori, Ampachi Town, Ampachi District. Reinforcement work was immediately carried out, and the work was completed at 10:20 a.m. A few minutes later, vibrations like an earthquake occurred on the embankment, causing residents engaged in flood prevention activities to feel uneasy and evacuate from the embankment. Then, at 10:28 a.m., the embankment on the right bank of the Nagara River, 300 meters downstream from the Nagara River Bridge of the Tokaido Shinkansen in Omori, Ampachi Town, Ampachi District, breached over a span of about 20 meters. The breach widened due to water pressure, reaching a width of approximately 80 meters. By the evening of the same day, flooding had affected 1,200 households. Additionally, at the Jurenbo embankment of the Waju embankment, located on the border between Ampachi Town and the downstream Wanochi Town, work was carried out to close off the embankment to protect Wanochi Town and to equalize the water levels in Ampachi Town and the Nagara River to stop the muddy flow. As a result, the water, which had nowhere to go, began to flow backward, flooding the entire area of Mino-machi upstream. Furthermore, embankments also breached at five locations, including the Ijira River, a tributary of the Nagara River. Overflow and inundation occurred in various areas, leading to widespread flooding of houses in Gifu City, Ogaki City, Hozumi Town in Motosu District, Takami Town in Yamagata District, and Ijira Village."

In areas with earlier establishment and lower land elevation, such as Maki Wajū, sandbags and tatami mats were piled on eroded embankment remnants to prevent flooding. Even in Moribe Wajū, where the embankment collapsed, settlements located at the base of the old embankment were spared from damage. However, in Seka Wajū, the southern embankment had been decommissioned, making it impossible to stop the incoming water, which exacerbated the damage."

Sediment filled the valleys carved by the Totsukawa River (Kumano River), creating 37 natural dams and resulting in the appearance of many dammed lakes. Floods caused by the collapse of these natural dams led to extensive damage. The sediment deposits drastically altered the terrain, with an estimated average of 30 meters of sand and gravel accumulating on the riverbed. This disaster is recorded as a typical example of deep-seated landslides. Totsukawa-go, consisting of six villages—Kita-Totsukawa Village, Totsukawa Hanazono Village, Naka-Totsukawa Village, Nishi-Totsukawa Village, Minami-Totsukawa Village, and Higashi-Totsukawa Village—suffered significant losses: out of 12,862 residents, 168 died, 426 houses were completely destroyed or washed away, and including partially damaged houses, 610 houses, or one-fourth of the total 2,403 houses, were affected. Additionally, 226 hectares of farmland were buried or washed away, and the damage to forests was severe, leaving approximately 3,000 people without a livelihood. A prefectural official noted that \"it may take about 30 years to restore to its original state.\" In October of the same year, 2,691 disaster victims relocated to Hokkaido, leading to the establishment of Shin-Totsukawa Village."

It conveys detailed records of 12 villages in the Yoshino District that were affected by the disaster. These 12 villages include six villages in the Totsukawa area, as well as Tenkawa Village, Oto Village (now part of Gojo City), Nosegawa Village upstream, and the villages of Sogibai (now part of Gojo City), Nanyoshino (now part of Shimoichi Town and Kurotaki Village), and Kanau (now part of Gojo City) located on the northern side of the watershed adjacent to the Kinokawa River system. Each volume is dedicated to one village, but Volume 10 combines two villages, Sogibai and Nanyoshino, into one, resulting in 11 volumes for 12 villages. \n\nThe damage figures in the table above are summarized from the statistical tables at the end of each volume. The total figures for all villages are provided in the preface of Volume 1, and the figures for each village are included in the main text of each volume. Regarding the number of deaths, washed-away houses, and completely destroyed houses, there are slight discrepancies between the figures in the main text and the statistical tables for some villages, but they are mostly consistent. \n\nOn the other hand, the number of large-scale landslides differs in five out of the 12 villages. For example, Sogibai Village is listed as having zero in the statistical table, but the main text records 101 locations. Summing up the figures in the main text for all villages results in 1,372 locations. Even if the discrepancies between the statistical tables and the main text are considered within a margin of error, the preface states the number of large-scale landslides as 247, which is significantly different. It is possible that the figure of 247 in the preface was a misprint of the survey figure of 1,147. The number of large-scale landslides refers to the occurrence of mountain collapses with dimensions of 50 ken (approximately 90 meters) or more in both length and width. Small-scale landslides occurred everywhere and were either ignored or described as countless depending on the region. \n\nThe large-scale mountain collapses and the formation of new lakes caused by the disaster particularly struck the northern Totsukawa and western Totsukawa villages, as evident from the table above. The sediment from the mountain collapses blocked rivers that were carrying muddy torrents, creating new lakes. Eventually, as the water level rose, the water pressure increased, or the dam overflowed and eventually breached.\""

However, the force of the water at this time was not severe, and as the tide began to recede around the 5th hour, the water level started to drop. \n\nMeanwhile, around the same time, massive floods that occurred upstream in the Tone River, Arakawa River, and Tama River began flowing downstream toward Edo. Particularly, the water flow from the Tone River, where levees had been destroyed, swept away Sekiyado Castle and headed toward the low-lying areas of Edo. On the night of August 3 (September 1, 1742), just as the water had begun to recede and people in the low-lying areas of Edo were feeling relieved, the floodwaters struck directly. The water level continued to rise until August 7, during which over 900 people drowned in the Honjo, Asakusa, and Shitaya areas alone. According to a report by the town magistrate Masatomo Ishikawa, the water level in Honjo reached 5 shaku (approximately 1.5 meters) in the streets, and in some places, it reached 7 shaku (approximately 2.1 meters), submerging many houses up to their eaves. Additionally, many bridges, including Ryogoku Bridge, Shin-Ohashi Bridge, and Eitai Bridge, were swept away. \n\nHowever, on August 8, when the water level had begun to recede, another storm struck Edo, causing the water level to rise again. In Asakusa and Shitaya, the water level finally reached 1 jo (approximately 3 meters) (\"Tokugawa Jikki\"), and it took several more days for the water to recede. \n\nConcerned about this situation, the shogunate gathered boats and dispatched them to the low-lying areas, where the distinction between rivers and streets had disappeared, to rescue people being swept away or trembling on rooftops and trees. Furthermore, they distributed porridge and rice to the victims. According to records, the number of people receiving food aid was 6,000 on August 6, 10,000 at the peak of the disaster on August 8, and even on the 16th, when the water had receded and aid was limited to daytime, 7,000 people still required assistance. Additionally, some influential merchants in Edo, who suffered less damage, independently provided food aid. \n\nThe shogunate ordered ten western domains, including Anotsu, Bizen, Choshu, and Higo, which had suffered less damage, to undertake the restoration of levees and irrigation channels along the Tone River and Arakawa River to bring the situation under control."

                "content": "On October 6, by the decision of the senior councilors Matsudaira Norisada, Matsudaira Nobutsugu, and Honda Tadayoshi, ten feudal lords from the western provinces were ordered to assist in construction work. In cases of construction assistance by feudal lords, the shogunate bore the cost of supplying necessary materials such as timber, pit wood, and iron, while the ordered feudal lords covered expenses for labor, bamboo and timber cutting, transportation, and so on. Each domain appointed senior retainers of the rank of chief retainer as general overseers and dispatched their retainers to the disaster site for restoration work. The shogunate ordered the lords of the Okayama, Tsu, Sabae, Izushi, Obi, and Usuki domains, who were present in Edo, to report directly to the castle, while sending official letters to other domains. \n\nIn the case of the Kumamoto domain, on October 21, a letter from the shogunate's senior councilors was delivered to Kumamoto. Hasegawa Mondo, who served as both a magistrate and construction overseer, received the order and, after raising funds in Osaka, arrived in Edo later than other domain officials. Construction began on December 7. For on-site work and huts, contracts were given to influential townspeople and village headmen in Edo. On April 30 of the following year, senior retainers of the Kumamoto domain visited the private residence of a senior councilor to report that the construction was completed on April 29, and on May 1, they reported the same to Edo Castle. However, there were neither words of reprimand nor praise. The total expenditure of the Kumamoto domain amounted to 127,280 ryō. Although there were rewards from the shogunate, the amount was less than that given to smaller domains. Gifts from the Kumamoto domain to the shogunate were considered perks for officials, but some refused to accept them. The reason is unknown. Considering the amount spent, the Kumamoto domain judged that hiring contractors would have been cheaper, but Takasaki remarked that commercial spirit could not surpass the samurai code."

In the Chikuma and Sai River basins of Shinano Province, the damage on the 1st day of the 8th month in the old calendar (August 30, 1742) was particularly severe. Even over 280 years later, a custom remains of visiting graves on August 1st in the new calendar to mourn the victims, separate from the traditional Obon grave visits. Some companies even list this day as a special holiday in their recruitment information.\n\nThe scale of the disaster is conveyed through local traditions, written records, and memorial monuments, with over 2,800 deaths across the basin and extensive loss of farmland, making it an unprecedented catastrophe. Not only did the main stream of the Chikuma River overflow and breach embankments, but small rivers in mountainous areas also flooded in various locations. It is estimated that the volume of water that overflowed was 232 million cubic kilometers.\n\nBased on records from the pillars of Myoshoji Temple's main hall in Nagano City, flood level markers indicating the water levels during the flood have been erected in several locations in Nagano City and surrounding municipalities. Additionally, according to accounts, the water level near the current Tategahana water level observation point is estimated to have reached 36 shaku (10.9 meters)."

Due to heavy rain that had continued for several days, the water level of the Shinano River rose, and the embankment in Yokota Village, Nishikanbara District, Niigata Prefecture (now Yokota, Tsubame City), breached in a section approximately 360 meters long, along with 874 other locations in the prefecture. As a result, a wide area up to Sekiya in Niigata City was flooded, with a damage area of 180 km². A total of 43,600 houses were flooded, both below and above floor level, and 25,000 houses were washed away. Furthermore, in low-lying areas, there were places where the water did not recede even by autumn, leading to the spread of infectious diseases such as dysentery and typhoid due to stagnant water rotting, resulting in many deaths. In response to this disaster, there was a growing call for the construction of a diversion channel in a section approximately 10 km long from Okawazu, Mishima District, Okawazu Village (now Okawazu, Tsubame City) to Nozumi Village, the same district (now Teradomari Nozumi, Nagaoka City). The Okawazu Diversion began its second phase of construction in 1907 (Meiji 40) and was completed with water flow starting on August 25, 1922 (Taisho 11)."

This was a typical late rainy season situation prone to triggering torrential rains. Warm, moist air from the south flowed into the front, stimulating it and resulting in heavy rainfall. Particularly in the region from southern Yamagata Prefecture to northern Niigata Prefecture, centered around the Iide Mountain Range, record-breaking torrential rains fell, causing the worst flooding in history for rivers sourced in this area, including the Mogami River, Miomote River, Arakawa River, Tainai River, and Kaji River."

Additionally, a torrential downpour (Kaetsu Flood) had occurred on July 17 of the previous year, 1966 (Showa 41), and as the damage from that event had not yet been fully restored, another torrential downpour struck, further exacerbating the damage. The most severe damage occurred in the Arakawa River basin. In this area, a torrential rainfall of approximately 700 millimeters over 30 hours was recorded in Sekikawa Village, Iwafune District. As a result, the Arakawa River and its tributary, the Oishigawa River, overflowed, causing levees to collapse in various locations. The town was buried in muddy water and rocks that flowed down from upstream. This resulted in 34 deaths and 371 houses being completely or partially destroyed in Sekikawa Village alone, with total damages amounting to 17.7 billion yen, which was 60 times the village's annual budget (approximately 300 million yen) at the time. Additionally, the Iwafune Power Plant of Arakawa Hydroelectric Power, constructed on the Arakawa River, suffered damage to its power generation equipment due to flooding caused by the heavy rain. However, the Iwafune Dam, which serves as the intake point, was not significantly affected.\n\nIn the Tainai River basin, the Tainai No. 1 Dam of the Niigata Prefecture Enterprise Bureau recorded a total daily rainfall of 645 millimeters, while the Tainai No. 1 Power Plant recorded 542 millimeters. In Nakajo Town and Kurokawa Village (both now part of Tainai City) in Kitakanbara District, levees collapsed at Akagawa in the midstream area and Atsutazaka in the downstream area of the Tainai River, resulting in the flooding of 2,170 houses and 2,330 hectares of farmland and other areas. In the Miomote River basin, a torrential rainfall of 391.5 millimeters was recorded over two days in the upstream area, and flooding damage expanded in Murakami City downstream. In the Kajikawa River basin, torrential rainfall of 496 millimeters was recorded in one day at the Kajikawa Dam of Tohoku Electric Power, with over 300 millimeters recorded in various locations.\n\nAs a result, levees that had collapsed during the torrential downpour of the previous year in the Nishinagara area of Shibata City and Mukainakajo in Kajikawa Village (now part of Shibata City) collapsed again. Tributaries such as the Himedagawa River and Sakaigawa River also overflowed, causing Shibata City to suffer significant damage for the second consecutive year. In Murasugi Onsen in Sasakami Village, Yoshio Sato, a local member of the House of Councillors who was on vacation, was caught in a landslide and died. In the Agano River system, the Fukushima Swamp overflowed, causing flooding in surrounding areas, and in Sado, the Kokufu River overflowed, resulting in flooding damage.\n\nIn the Kaetsu region, all major rivers, including the Agano River, Kajikawa River, Tainai River, Arakawa River, and Miomote River, overflowed, flooding surrounding areas. The extent of the flooding encompassed most of the lowlands from the southern bank of the Miomote River to the northern bank of the Agano River, creating a situation that resembled the birth of a new lake. As a result, major transportation routes such as National Routes 7, 49, and 113, as well as the Uetsu Main Line and Yonesaka Line of Japanese National Railways, were disrupted by flooding and landslides. The Yonesaka Line took 89 days to be restored, highlighting the significant damage to the region's transportation infrastructure. The total damage in Niigata Prefecture, when converted to current monetary value, amounted to an extremely large sum of approximately 333.8 billion yen."

The damage within the prefecture included 8 deaths, 137 injuries, 167 houses destroyed, 10,818 houses flooded above floor level, 11,016 houses flooded below floor level, and 13,180 hectares of farmland inundated, with the total damage estimated at 22.638 billion yen. When converted to the current monetary value, this amounts to an enormous loss of approximately 66.11 billion yen. In Oguni Town, Nishiokitama District, which suffered particularly severe damage, the Arakawa River and its tributary Yokokawa River overflowed, causing flooding within the town. In the mountainous areas, landslides and debris flows occurred frequently, leading to significant impacts such as the entire community of 4 households and 18 residents in the Koedo district abandoning their settlement and relocating. Additionally, the Akashiba Power Plant, owned by Toshiba Denko at the time, was flooded by muddy waters, damaging its power generation equipment and affecting the operations of Toshiba Denko's Oguni Manufacturing Plant (now owned by Covalent Materials), a major industry in Oguni Town. The total damage in Oguni Town amounted to approximately 7.8 billion yen, equivalent to 20 years of the village's budget being wiped out overnight. Furthermore, in the Mogami River system, the Okitama Shirakawa, Okitama Nogawa, and Sagae Rivers overflowed. The Mogami River, where these rivers converge, also experienced flooding that breached levees in Shirataka Town, causing inundation not only in the Okitama region, including Yonezawa City and Nagai City, but also in the Murayama region, including Sagae City. In the Okitama region, in particular, debris flows and driftwood surged downstream, leading to the loss of bridges and further exacerbating the damage."

Normally, the planned maximum water flow is determined based on the worst floods in the past, but during the Uetsu heavy rain, floods exceeding the planned maximum water flow were recorded in almost all rivers. This was due to the record-breaking heavy rain that fell upstream, forcing the Ministry of Construction (now the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism), Niigata Prefecture, and Yamagata Prefecture to fundamentally review their flood control measures. As a result, various measures such as strengthening and extending embankments, widening river widths, and renovating bridges that obstruct water flow were undertaken, but the most focused effort was the construction of dams to control floods in the upstream areas."

                "content": "First, regarding the Arakawa river system, which became the most severely affected area, the river classification, initially a secondary river, was upgraded to a primary river in 1968. A basic plan for the implementation of construction on the Arakawa river system was formulated, incorporating flood control measures directly managed by the national government. At this time, a plan was made to construct two multipurpose dams in the Arakawa river system. For the main stream of the Arakawa River, there was a post-war plan in 1952 to construct the Arakawa No. 1 Dam and Arakawa No. 2 Dam for flood control. However, since water rights for the Akashiba Power Plant had already been acquired, proceeding with the plan would have submerged the Akashiba Dam, leading to the eventual abandonment of the plan. Subsequently, with the completion of the Iwafune Dam, there were no promising sites for dam construction on the main stream of the Arakawa River. Therefore, a plan was developed to construct dams on the tributaries Oishigawa and Yokokawa, resulting in the completion of the Oishi Dam (Oishigawa) in 1979 and the Yokokawa Dam (Yokokawa) in 2008. Since the completion of the Oishi Dam, no flood disasters causing fatalities have occurred in the Arakawa area.\n\nRegarding the Mogami River system, it had already been designated as a primary river in 1965, and the basic plan for flood control projects, the Mogami River System Construction Implementation Basic Plan, was also formulated in the same year. However, following the damage caused by the Uetsu Heavy Rain, the plan was revised in 1974, adopting a policy of flood control measures using multipurpose dams, similar to the Arakawa River. The Mogami River system had already been designated under the Mogami Special Regional Comprehensive Development Plan following the enactment of the National Comprehensive Development Act in 1950, with river improvements and dam construction carried out in the northern part of the prefecture. This time, however, the focus shifted to river improvements in the southern part of the prefecture, which is the upstream region of the Mogami River. Since there were no suitable sites for dam construction on the main stream of the Mogami River, the plan included the construction of the Okubo Retarding Basin on the main stream and multipurpose dams on three tributaries that had suffered significant damage: Okitama Shirakawa, Okitama Nogawa, and Sagae River. As a result, the Shirakawa Dam (Okitama Shirakawa) was completed in 1981, the Sagae Dam (Sagae River) in 1990, and the Okubo Retarding Basin in 1997. The last remaining Nagai Dam (Okitama Nogawa) was completed in 2011. \n\nThanks to this river improvement, during the torrential rains that hit the Mogami River basin in 1997, which were of a similar scale to the Uetsu Heavy Rain, the damage was minimized to 67 flooded houses, demonstrating the effectiveness of the flood control measures. It is worth noting that there was strong opposition to the Shirakawa Dam at the time, but compensation agreements with residents of the planned submerged area were rapidly concluded following the Uetsu Heavy Rain, highlighting the significant impact of the heavy rain disaster."

                "content": "In Niigata Prefecture, plans were made for multipurpose dams and flood control dams on the Sanmen River, Tainai River, and Kaji River, which are secondary rivers under its jurisdiction. The Sanmen Dam, the first multipurpose dam in the prefecture, was completed on the Sanmen River in 1953. However, following the Uetsu Heavy Rain, a large-scale flood control dam plan was devised upstream of the Sanmen Dam. This became the Oku-Sanmen Dam, which was later expanded into a multipurpose dam in 1976 and completed in 2001 as one of the largest dams in the prefecture. There was also a plan to construct the Takane River Dam on the Takane River, a tributary, but this plan was abandoned. Regarding the Tainai River, the Tainai River Dam was completed in 1976, and the Oku-Tainai Dam is currently under construction upstream. \n\nOn the Kaji River, the Kaji River Flood Control Dam, one of the largest flood control dams in Japan, was completed on the main stream in 1974. Additionally, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (formerly the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry) participated as a flood control operator in the construction of an agricultural dam on the tributary Uchinokura River, completing the Uchinokura Dam in 1972. Regarding Fukushima Swamp, the Fukushima Swamp Drainage Channel was constructed to discharge internal water from the swamp directly into the Sea of Japan. \n\nThe effects of these river improvements were evident during the Niigata-Fukushima Heavy Rain in 2004. While flooding damage was significant in the Shinano River system, the four rivers mentioned above experienced no notable flooding damage. In Yamagata Prefecture, the Tunagi River Dam (on the Tunagi River) was completed in 2006 to strengthen flood control measures in the Onimen River basin. \n\nTo ensure the memory of the Uetsu Heavy Rain does not fade, Niigata and Yamagata Prefectures held numerous events related to the Uetsu Heavy Rain in 2007, marking the 40th anniversary of the disaster, to raise awareness among residents about the damage caused by the heavy rain. In Sekikawa Village, the \"Echigo Sekikawa Great Snake Festival,\" held annually since 1988, takes place on the anniversary of the Uetsu Heavy Rain. The festival is held to pass on the memory of the flood to future generations. The giant snake used as a portable shrine is usually stored at the Oishi Dam and has a total length of 82.8 meters, a number associated with the date of the heavy rain. This reflects how deeply the Uetsu Heavy Rain remains a tragic and unforgettable memory for Sekikawa Village. The festival received the Handmade Hometown Award in fiscal year 2016."

Toruń is the largest city in the Chełmno Land located on the Vistula River[1]. Due to the lack of systematic measurements using objective scales, information about floods and other meteorological and climatic phenomena in Toruń until the end of the 18th century is incomplete[2]. The primary source of information about floods in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries are narrative city chronicles[3]. Systematic measurements of the water level in the Vistula began after 1760[4]."

Frequent floods between 1233 and 1236 forced the Teutonic Order to relocate the settlement from Old Toruń to its current location. According to historian Piotr Oliński, in the 15th–18th centuries, there were dozens of floods in the Chełmno land area, with several of them being extensive. Information about the flood of 1465/1466 comes from several sources, the oldest being records by the parish priest at the church of St. John, H. Waldau, written between 1481 and 1495. The flood reportedly destroyed ships, most of the city baths, the municipal slaughterhouse, and damaged the church of St. John, vineyards, and some residences. In the 16th century, major floods occurred in 1534, 1570, 1584, and 1593, and in the 17th century in 1611 (winter), 1628 (summer), and 1673. Between 1673 and 1718, there were no significant floods in Toruń. Another major flood occurred in the spring of 1719 when ice breaking on the Vistula River caused water to flow into the Bridge Gate. This flood caused significant material damage to the residents of the Vistula lowlands. Subsequent floods occurred in 1729, 1736 (summer), 1740 (spring), 1744, and 1745. Floods frequently damaged the wooden bridge built in 1500. In the 19th century, floods occurred in 1871, 1879, and 1891. During these floods, water reached the height of the Racławice Barracks, and in 1891, water also flowed into the Bridge Gate. Information about these floods comes from preserved flood markers. In July 1934, Toruń faced the largest flood in interwar Poland. During the 2001 flood, the water level exceeded 700 cm. The Vistula River flooded the lowest-lying areas of the city. During the 2010 flood, approximately 1,300 hectares of urban land were flooded. The water inundated, among other places, the Philadelphia Boulevard, the viaduct on Podgórska Street, Kaszczorek, allotment gardens in Rudak, and areas near ks. Popiełuszki and Przybyszewskiego Streets. On May 23, 2010, the water level exceeded 859 cm."

                "content": "The Flood of the Oathbreaker or the Flood of Valariko was a major flood that occurred in Finland in the spring of 1899. The flood got its name from the fact that in February 1899, the Emperor of Russia and Grand Duke of Finland, Nicholas II, issued the February Manifesto, which curtailed Finland's autonomous status and, according to the Finnish perception, broke the ruler's oath he had given to Finland. The causes of the flood were several preceding rainy years, the snowy winter of 1898–1899, and the rainy and warm spring of 1899. The flood particularly affected the water systems of the Kokemäenjoki, Kymijoki, and Vuoksi rivers. For example, the water level of Lake Päijänne was 193 cm higher than normal. The recurrence of such a flood is estimated to be 100–150 years. The Flood of the Oathbreaker gave a decisive impetus to the establishment of the Hydrographic Office, the predecessor of the Finnish Environment Institute. A committee set up by the Finnish Senate in the summer of 1899 to investigate flood damages estimated the flood damages of 1898–1899 to be approximately 10 million marks. The floods did not claim human lives; only one horse with its cart drowned."

Most of the floods have been caused by the overflow of the rivers (often more than one at the same time), and the period when they are most frequent is during the last part of the year (from September to December). The most significant documented floods occurred in 1843 (with more than a hundred victims), in 1940 (known as the Aiguat de Sant Lluc, which caused between 6 and 15 victims and numerous affected people), and in 1970 (with major material damage).

It has a nivo-pluvial regime and reaches its peak flow during the month of May; however, currently, there are several reservoirs along its course (Sau, Susqueda, and Pasteral) that make the river's flow highly regulated. The other three rivers contribute their water: the Onyar and the Güell directly, while the Galligants flows into the Onyar. In fact, the Güell flowed into the Onyar until 1968, when it was channeled and diverted to the Ter due to the numerous floods it caused. Apart from the four rivers, there are or have been other watercourses such as streams, torrents, and irrigation channels, such as the Monar Canal or the Bullidors stream."

In the years 1421, 1425, and 1445 – when Girona was the capital of the Girona-Besalú vegueria – there were also significant floods: the second caused damage to the bridge connecting Pedret with the opposite bank of the Ter, and the third completely destroyed it. It seems that the cause of the floods was the narrowness of the Onyar riverbed and the accumulation of debris on both sides. The official-archivist Francesc Oliver wrote the following report in 1366 (originally in Spanish): \"[...] intercepting the course of the Onyar waters with that immense mass they placed within its bed\" (referring to the new constructions erected in the Plaça de les Cols and Sant Feliu). As for the Ter, it was a river that easily overflowed; when it did, the Onyar could not discharge its flow, which caused serious problems."

The waters severely damaged the monastery of Sant Pere de Galligants and swept away the image of the Virgin of Remedy, which was later recovered.

There is no record of any casualties, but it caused significant material damage to the northern orchards of the city (Devesa area and the neighborhoods of Mercadal, Sant Pere de Galligants, and Pedret). Other notable floods include those that occurred in Amer in September 1926, which were immortalized by Valentí Fargnoli Annetta with his camera and significantly affected the Ter downstream of Girona, destroying several bridges and altering the riverbed. In Catalonia, this flood was known as the Sant Ramon flood. The so-called Sant Lluc flood, which began on October 18, 1940, and lasted three to four days, was one of the most devastating ever recorded in the Girona region (although the most affected area in Catalonia was Osona). The overflow of the Ter (which flooded the entire Devesa), the Onyar (which reached two meters in height in the old town), and the Güell (which collapsed the Mart bridge) caused the death of about ten people (including Lieutenant Huarte, who died helping to save people and after whom a current bridge is named) and significant damage to the city, which was just recovering from the Spanish Civil War. The newspaper El Pirineo on the evening of October 18 reported the following: \"The waters, bursting through the city, have flooded the lower streets at both ends, reaching streets and squares where they had only rarely reached before. [...] The maximum height reached by the waters of the Ter as they passed through our city was more than seven meters above the ordinary level, spanning a width of three kilometers.\" The 1960s saw the last three major floods, in 1962, 1963, and 1970. Of the three, the one on October 12, 1970, was the most significant: water levels reached 1.26 meters on Ballesteries Street (Old Town) in the flood that caused the most damage throughout the century. The Onyar River, after breaking a retaining wall, invaded the city's streets, while the Güell and the Massana stream flooded the Sant Narcís neighborhood. There were no fatalities, but 2,000 people were affected, and losses amounted to 500 million pesetas."

At the end of the 15th century, a dam with gates was built in the northern sector of Girona, which was heavily criticized by the residents of the lower part of the city. There was also a dam at the mouth of the Galligants, which was demolished in 1589. In the 18th century, Girona's residents believed that the La Manola dam, located in Pedret, was the cause of the periodic floods that plagued the city. After the flood of 1732, they requested the city council, through the military governor, to demolish the dam, which experts did not approve; however, the dam was later demolished in the year XXX. In 1722, a water defense wall and a railing were built to counter the action of the Ter. At the beginning of the 19th century, a plan was proposed to divert the Ter river through Puig d'en Roca; the project was not carried out due to its high economic cost. During this same century, alert systems (bell tolls, gunshots, etc.) were used to warn of floods, and an evacuation system for people was also studied, using wooden bridges, openings in party walls, etc., which worked quite well in most cases except during the flood of 1843, due to its exceptional magnitude. Due to the floods caused by the Onyar river in 1970, a series of works were carried out between that year and 1972 on the riverbed as it passed through the city to prevent similar future events, giving the basin a prismatic concrete shape. On the other hand, the construction of the Pasteral and Susqueda dams contributed significantly to reducing the flow of the Ter river. The Güell was also channeled between 1965 and 1968."

                "content": "The Gauldal landslide was a sand and gravel slide followed by a flood disaster in Gauldalen in 1345. The slide and flooding are often referred to as Norway's largest natural disaster in history. According to Icelandic sources, the slide occurred on the Feast of the Cross, September 14, 1345. There are not many sources from this time that mention the slide. The first source, the Skålholt Annals, written three years after the slide, and two other sources, the Lawman's Annals and the Flatøy Annals, contain information about the event. Additionally, oral tradition and geological interpretations have contributed to explaining the event. According to the old sources, the slide occurred at Kvasshylla, or the Haga farm, three kilometers north of Støren. The slide dammed the Gaula River and created a lake, sometimes referred to as Hagavatnet, which stretched 14 kilometers up the valley to Bones. Up the valley, 25 farms were flooded and completely destroyed. Eventually, the dam, which must have been between 30 m and 40 m high, collapsed, and large amounts of loose material and water flooded the valley all the way down to Melhus. Over 50 farms and seven churches are said to have been destroyed by the slide and flooding, and over 500 people perished. Recent estimates indicate that a slide likely occurred at Kvasshylla so long ago. The estimates show that the slide must have been at least 45 million cubic meters if it is true that the lake stretched all the way up to Bones. The dam must have been at least 33 m high for the lake to have stretched so far up the valley. The Gauldal landslide was nevertheless not as large as the Verdal landslide, but many more people perished in Gauldalen. Why so many perished may perhaps be related to the fact that it was in the middle of a pilgrimage route. One of the oldest sources actually mentions that about 250 travelers and over 250 residents lost their lives in the slide. The slide in Gauldalen covered a much larger area than the Verdal landslide. The entire valley from Bones far up the valley and all the way down to Melhus was destroyed, mainly due to the flood after the dam burst. It has been claimed that the slide was a clay slide, but a dissertation published in 2001 proves that it was sand and gravel that slid out."

In the afternoon, three storm cores formed over southern Moravia, accompanied by intense rainfall, with precipitation totals of 32.7 mm in the Prostějov area and 76.0 mm in the Brno area. However, significantly more water fell in the Kyjov area, where the ČHMÚ rain gauge station in Ždánice recorded a total of 133.6 mm between 16:10 and 19:20. The rainfall thus significantly exceeded the general threshold for a cloudburst (70 mm in 3 hours). The most affected area was approximately 200 to 250 km² northwest and west of Kyjov. The purely local nature of the storms is evidenced by the fact that other stations in the vicinity recorded significantly lower precipitation totals (Kyjov 39.3 mm, Koryčany 34.3 mm, Klobouky u Brna 23.2 mm, and Bučovice 15.2 mm). Small and sometimes temporarily drying streams in this area swelled to multiple times their usual flow rates within minutes."

The Šardice stream spread to a width of 150 meters, flooding the undermined area of the Dukla lignite mine in Šardice, which it flowed near. Local terrain depressions immediately filled with water, which then broke into the interior of the mine, and the tunnels were soon flooded with mudflows. At that moment, 110 miners were working in the mine, and 34 of them perished. Several hundred meters away in Šardice, the Church of St. Michael the Archangel was also flooded to a height of 50 cm, although according to the oldest records, it had never been flooded before. Below the confluence with the Kyjovka stream, the flood wave dissipated, causing practically no damage. However, the Kyjovka indirectly caused the last victim of the flood when a three-year-old girl (Lenka Šťastná) fell into a flooded cellar in Kyjov. The floodwaters also heavily affected the village of Lovčice, located on a gentle slope at the southwestern edge of the Ždánice Forest. The water reservoir on the Jordánek stream, situated at the very beginning of the village, could not withstand the influx of water from the terrain. After its dam broke, the flood wave was further amplified by the reservoir's existing supply. The water rushed into the village so quickly that in one house, people had to break through the ceiling to escape the rising water. Often, people fled their homes with only the clothes they were wearing. In the village, 128 houses were flooded, another 49 were slightly damaged, five houses were demolished, and seven were completely destroyed, but there were no casualties. The surge of water from Lovčice then rushed down the Lovčice stream valley into the Trkmanka river. Below its confluence with the Soudný stream, it first flooded the village of Dražůvky, where a pond dam also broke, and where children from a kindergarten had to be rescued at great risk to life. The flood surge also destroyed bridges and practically demolished three houses. The widening valley below the village of Želetice was flooded to a width of up to 300 meters, but other villages downstream experienced almost no damage. In a valley further west, the Zdravá Voda stream flooded part of the village of Žarošice, where the water rose to the steps of the cultural center, but without significant recorded damage. The floods damaged not only local bridges but also more significant transportation structures. Road I/54 between Žarošice and Strážovice had to be closed due to the undermining of part of its structure and two bridges. Road I/51 between Krumvíř and Terezín was passable only for trucks. The Čejč–Ždánice railway line, which follows the Trkmanka river, was completely destroyed over a stretch of approximately 300 meters. Near Bohuslavice, the railway line Brno–Kyjov–Trenčianska Teplá was damaged, with one track adjacent to the Kyjovka river being taken out of service. Near Velké Pavlovice, the embankment of the D2 highway under construction from Brno to Bratislava was partially damaged. Flooding, erosion, mudflows, and deposits also rendered crops on 9,000 hectares of farmland unusable."

                "content": "During the peak of political normalization, party and state authorities reported on the catastrophic consequences of this flood almost exclusively in connection with the human tragedy at the Dukla mine. The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs of the Czech Socialist Republic, Emilian Hamerník, was sent to the site of the disaster. The nationwide daily Rudé právo, published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, reported on the natural disaster with an extensive article on the front page of the newspaper on Thursday, June 11, 1970, focusing mainly on the rescue efforts at the Šardice Dukla mine, while information about other damages was significantly more concise. The South Moravian regional daily Rovnost, published by the local Regional Committee of the Communist Party, reported on the event only on Friday, June 12, 1970: \"The exceptional scale of Tuesday's cloudburst is evidenced by the fact that within two hours, 195 mm of water fell in a relatively small area. For comparison, this is approximately one-third of the usual annual rainfall in this region.\" Rudé právo then wrote daily on the front page about efforts to rescue the miners, continued with the publication of a communiqué from the government of the Czech Socialist Republic titled \"We bow before the memory of the fallen heroes of labor\" on Wednesday, June 17, 1970, followed by expressions of condolences the next day, and concluded with information about the mourning ceremony for the deceased miners held in Dubňany on Monday, June 22, 1970, even though most of the deceased were still inside the partially flooded mine. During those days, the South Moravian region was hit by new cloudbursts, which, however, caused only material damage. The indignant voices of miners and survivors, pointing out, among other things, the low safety of the mining operation, whose operator neglected the remediation of terrain subsidence and thus allowed the accumulation of surface water directly above the mine, received no publicity. The flood was one of the reasons for the construction of the Zápověď reservoir, located several hundred meters from the Dukla mine upstream of the Šardice stream. It is speculated that poor information about natural disasters may have been the cause of the great surprise of the public and rescue services during the major floods of 1997 and 2002."

The water rose by several meters, and the accumulated floes formed two-meter-high barriers. In some places, the flood exceeded the level of the 1890 flood (which had destroyed Charles Bridge). After several days, the deposited floes were removed using explosives.

In the Vltava River basin, water levels rose very quickly to the level of a hundred-year or two-hundred-year flood. In Prague, the water level peaked on February 28, when it rose by four meters within 12 hours, and its flow rate was calculated at approximately 4580 m³/s. On that day, 114 streets, 785 houses were flooded in the capital, and after an ice floe struck the water-eroded sixth pillar of the Stone Bridge, the flood defense head of the stone structure, along with a military guardhouse and five soldiers, collapsed into the Vltava. On February 29, the eighth pillar of the Stone Bridge, which housed a statue of St. Wenceslas with two angels by Ottavio Most, was also damaged, with one of the angels falling into the Vltava. The torso of the fallen angel was found by divers under the bridge in 2004. On the Elbe and other Czech streams, water level peaks were recorded a day or two later. During the flood, the Prague weirs were also breached, and the lowered Vltava water level revealed the pillars of the Romanesque Judith Bridge and river thresholds, from which Václav Fortunát Durych later derived the name Prague."

It was caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and rapid warming, which led to the quick melting of a substantial snow cover. The worst situation was on the Dyje and Nové Mlýny, in the basins of the Elbe, Morava, and Lužnice rivers. Several settlements were flooded, including larger parts of cities (Ústí nad Labem, Olomouc, Planá nad Lužnicí, and Znojmo). The Vltava did not cause more serious damage because it was partially regulated using the pre-emptively drained reservoirs of the Vltava Cascade, especially Lipno. The floods began on March 25, 2006, and ended around April 5. The high water affected communities along the Vltava, Lužnice, Elbe, Sázava, and Jizera rivers. Among the most affected towns was Veselí nad Lužnicí and its surroundings on the Lužnice River, where up to 400 homes were flooded. Other significantly affected communities included Planá nad Lužnicí, Soběslav, Křešice, České Kopisty, Litoměřice, and the Posázaví region. Moravia was not spared either. The floods eventually impacted seven regions with several hundred municipalities (e.g., 178 municipalities in South Bohemia). The Czech government initially released 380 million Czech crowns to compensate flood victims and later 5 billion from ČEZ stock dividends. The total flood damages amounted to up to 5 billion Czech crowns."

According to a statement by Znojmo's mayor Pavel Balík to the newspaper MF Dnes, when the inflow into the Vranov Reservoir was 200 m3/s, only 20 m3/s was being released, which, along with insufficient prior reserves for spring thawing, was the cause of the situation being mishandled. The most significant flood in 2006 occurred at the end of March and the beginning of April, during which some streams reached Q50 to Q100 (the letter Q denotes flow rate, and the number following it indicates the return period of the flow, e.g., Q50 = fifty-year flow). The second flood in 2006 occurred in May. The May flood was caused by rainfall on a wavy cold front, which repeatedly hit western Bohemia. The two-day rainfall total was up to around 120 mm. The result was flow rates of up to around Q50."

By noon on August 7, 2010, the level of the Jeřice River in Chrastava rose to 433 cm and, along with other smaller tributaries and water from nearby meadows and fields, flooded almost the entire town. The water caused massive damage to roads, all footbridges, and several bridges over the river were destroyed, and many houses had to be demolished. A similar situation occurred in the Frýdlant area in the Smědá River basin. In the town of Mimoň in the Česká Lípa district, the level of the Ploučnice River reached its historical maximum, climbing to a record 252 cm at 8:00 a.m. on August 8, 2010. In some places, flood waves occurred, with water rising by a meter within minutes. Crisis and flood management teams quickly declared all three levels of flood activity during the night. Firefighting units assisting during the first critical night lost several vehicles to the floods. Numerous villages and entire towns were flooded, and people from endangered areas were evacuated. Panic was further fueled by rumors of the Mlýnice dam breaking. By noon on Saturday, August 7, the first fatalities were confirmed. The army and police fully joined the rescue efforts, and firefighters from neighboring regions began assisting in the most threatened areas around Frýdlant. By Sunday morning, the fifth drowning victim was confirmed, and firefighters from Germany also began helping. The situation was also serious in South Bohemia, where the evacuation of Veselí nad Lužnicí was threatened."

According to additional data from the Liberec Region Council, 79 municipalities were submerged, 7 bridges were completely destroyed, 5 people died, and the total property damage in the region amounted to 5 billion CZK. The Czech government sent the region 40 million CZK as immediate aid, followed by 350 million CZK for the Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions. Rescue operations involved 1,040 firefighters, 780 soldiers, and over 700 police officers and municipal guards. During looting, 5 foreigners were detained and subsequently convicted. Additionally, 200 prisoners assisted in dealing with the aftermath. The Liberec Region and many cities established flood accounts and flood portals. Damage to second- and third-class roads managed by the Liberec Region was estimated at 2 billion CZK. Damage to roads owned by municipalities and the state was valued at another billion CZK. In Chrastava, as a replacement after the floods, a unique transporter from the Kolonka settlement near Hamrštejn was built and opened on October 10, 2010, along with three new wooden and iron lifting footbridges by October 17, 2011, which can be raised by about 2 meters in case of flooding. The lifting mechanism for each of them cost around 155,000 CZK."

The water overflowed the banks of the Tisza, Tereblia, Teresva, Borzhava, and Latorica rivers. One-quarter of the region's territory was flooded. According to Ukrainian government data as of November 17, 1998, 120 localities, including two cities in Zakarpattia, were flooded. In addition to the Zakarpattia region, the flood also reached 11 localities in the Lviv region. Floods and landslides damaged roads, railways, and power lines in the region, and several villages in remote areas became inaccessible. On November 21, a landslide caused by the recent flood killed a family of four, raising the total death toll from the flood to 17. Ukrainian geologists worked on mapping landslide-prone zones and took preventive measures. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the flood affected 400,000 residents of Ukraine, and 24,340 people were evacuated. A total of 5,893 rescuers deployed by the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the State Border Service participated in addressing the disaster's aftermath. They were equipped with 1,197 land vehicles, as well as 13 amphibious vehicles and 7 helicopters. On November 7, 1998, the Ukrainian government appealed to the United Nations for international assistance for the affected population. Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma called on NATO countries to provide aid to residents of the flood-affected areas. The Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration sent 27 trucks with aid for those in need to Ukraine. The Polish Humanitarian Action sent 24 tons of aid, mainly food and clothing, to the Vynohradiv district. In addition to Poland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Russia, and Slovakia also provided assistance to Ukraine. Yoko Ono donated 70,000 CHF to help the needy residents of Zakarpattia. On November 11, a Hungarian mobile health center was established in the border town of Vary, providing medical assistance to the region's residents. After the flood, as of December 11, 1998, around 50,000 families still required government assistance, and over 5,500 people remained displaced. In many localities, wells were contaminated, and dead animals could be found in the area. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), there was a risk of local residents contracting diarrhea and hepatitis A. On January 29, 1999, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, after conducting water tests, declared that the epidemic situation in the region was stable. The ICRC supported the Zakarpattia Red Cross in managing the situation in the region. National associations of the Danish, Hungarian, Polish, and Dutch Red Cross were also involved in providing assistance."

Since 2002, the \"Integrated Flood Protection Program in the Tisza River Basin\" has been implemented in the Transcarpathian region. In the first three years of its operation, it was implemented at only 13%. It was not until 2006 that it received full funding of 70.9 million hryvnias, but in subsequent years, funding issues reappeared. During the 2010 flood, financial losses amounted to 61 million hryvnias. In December 2017, the largest recorded flood in Transcarpathia occurred. Due to multiple exceedances of atmospheric precipitation norms and warming, the water levels in mountain rivers rose. Between December 9–17, three flood waves merged into one. The disaster reached its peak on December 16 and 17, and on December 18, the water level began to drop. As a result of the flood, 221 households were flooded, nearly 2,500 hectares of farmland were inundated, 8 sections of roads were damaged, and two bridges were destroyed. The UNIAN agency reported that in the years preceding the December 2017 flood, flood protection funds were cut due to the ongoing war in Donbas."

With an average rainfall of 700–970mm, it caused damages amounting to 13 million won, which accounted for 80% of the annual rainfall and 58% of the budget of the Governor-General of Korea at the time. In Seoul alone, 647 people died, and about 6,792 houses were swept away by the strong currents. A total of 17,045 houses collapsed, 46,813 houses were flooded, and 29,229 people were displaced."

Heavy rainfall of 300-500mm fell in areas south of Hwanghae Province, causing the Han River to reach a water level of 10.57m at Guryongsan, and the Han River, Geum River, Mangyeong River, and Nakdong River overflowed."

Due to consecutive floods, the water level of the Han River reached its peak, causing embankments to collapse and flooding the Yongsan area, with water reaching as far as the front of Sungnyemun. Transportation and communication in downtown Seoul were also paralyzed. At the time, over 400 people drowned, and more than 12,000 houses were lost. It is said that the Jeongot Bridge was also destroyed during this time. However, various relics were discovered due to the flood, including the Baekje Pungnap Earthen Fortress and the prehistoric settlement site in Amsa-dong. On the 18th, the Han River recorded water levels of 13.59m at Ttukseom, 11.66m at Hangang Bridge, and 12.47m at Guryongsan. At that time, the railway office in Yongsan was flooded up to the ceiling of the first floor, and trains at Yongsan Station were submerged. Additionally, a tributary formed at Ttukseom, leading to the creation of the name Sincheon (新川), and water reached the upper branches of the zelkova tree at Pisudae, which has now disappeared. The areas most severely affected were Dongbu Ichon-dong, Ttukseom, Songpa, Jamsilli, Sincheon-ri, and Pungnap-ri, where embankments had not been installed. The damage to the Nakdong River was also severe. Daejeo Island was almost completely destroyed, and 200 bodies were found below the island. On the 12th, embankments collapsed in Miryang and Gimje, leaving 2,000 people missing, and on the 15th, embankments collapsed in Changwon, leaving 6,000 people isolated or missing."

The damage caused by the floods amounted to 10.3 million won, which was equivalent to 58% of the annual budget of the Joseon Governor-General's Office at the time. To recover, the Joseon Governor-General's Office even mobilized the military and carried out large-scale embankment construction on the main stream of the Han River and its tributaries, such as Anyangcheon, Jungnangcheon, and Cheonggyecheon. This flood, which submerged most of the Han River basin, led to the discovery of Pungnap Toseong and the prehistoric residential site in Amsa-dong as the Songpa-dong area was flooded. Meanwhile, a Japanese official named Kajiyama, who worked for the Joseon Governor-General's Office, created the Kajiyama formula, a simple flood volume formula derived from empirical experience, as a result of this flood."

The most affected areas in Bohemia were the Vltava basin, later the lower course of the Elbe, and marginally also the streams in the Ohře basin and the Dyje basin in Moravia. Along with the floods in Moravia and Silesia in 1997, it ranks among the most severe natural disasters in modern Czech history. It was the largest flood since the devastating Great Flood in 1845.

                "content": "On August 6, 2002, weather in Bohemia began to be influenced by a low-pressure system, which, with its frontal system, was slowly moving eastward. By August 7 and 8, persistent heavy rainfall had filled most of the rivers in South and West Bohemia. On Thursday, August 8, the flood in some places had already reached the extent of a 50-year flood (especially in South Bohemia). The situation, however, gradually calmed, and on August 9, the rain stopped. The Vltava River in Prague reached a flow rate of 1,500 m³/s and began to recede. On August 11 and 12, it started raining again. Over the southwest of Bohemia, two significant frontal systems collided, which moved only slowly to the northeast. Additionally, the windward effect in South Bohemia brought further intensification of the rain. The soil, saturated with water from previous rainfall, could no longer retain the water, which flowed into the already full rivers. During the week of August 12 to 18, parts of Bohemia were affected by a 500-year to 1,000-year flood. The Vltava River and its basin were the most affected, followed later by the lower Elbe River and, to a lesser extent, rivers in the Ohře and Dyje basins. The cause of the floods was above-average rainfall, which in the first rainfall episode mainly affected South Bohemia and, in the second episode, occurred across most of Bohemia. In addition to the significant saturation of soil and riverbeds from the first rainfall episode, the situation was also influenced by waterworks, particularly the Vltava Cascade. These captured a relatively large portion of the flood wave from the first rainfall episode. However, the reservoirs were unable to handle the second rainfall episode, and the flood advanced into the valleys without major obstacles. A noticeable flattening of the flood wave on the Vltava, and subsequently on the Elbe, occurred only due to overflows in the Polabská lowland. Nevertheless, even this was not enough, and the high water also affected towns further north in Bohemia and later the German section of the Elbe."

The greatest disaster occurred on the Vlčí stream in the village of Jíno (formerly Jinín), where 24 people died, seven houses were completely destroyed, and twenty were damaged to varying degrees; the height of the mud deposits reached 70 cm (two and a half feet). During the flood, about 40 head of cattle perished. On the Příchovice stream, the water from the Zlatý stream attacked the pond below the Lužský forest, breaking the pond's dam, destroying a sawmill, and killing eight people. Downstream, the water overflowed the dam of the pond in Horšice and surged toward the settlement of Vitouň, where it broke the dam of the Vitouň pond and also the dams of the pond in Radkovice. The surge wave reached up to two meters in height, carrying logs and timber from the sawmill and destroyed houses. In Radkovice, four people died, and in Příchovice, nine. Mills in Liebštejn and Příchovice were destroyed or damaged. Mud deposits, remnants of trees, dwellings, and boulders (up to 150 kg) covered fields and meadows, or topsoil was washed away from the fields. A total of 53 people died. An engineering unit from Plzeň was sent to assist the area. Public collections were organized to help the affected, both financially and in the form of food, clothing, or building materials. Another flood hit the area on August 2, 1890. After these floods, the regulation of streambeds began, and the regulation was completed in 1903."

Until then, the rivers were covered with a thick layer of ice, which suddenly began to melt and crack. As a result of this phenomenon, around March 15, the water levels of rivers in the Vltava and Elbe basins rose, and remnants of ice floes were carried along the riverbeds. These ice floes, driven by the water, destroyed everything in their path with great force. This phenomenon is called \"dřenice.\" From March 17, the water level began to drop again.

Radar echoes from the night show that the storm originated southwest of the Gulf of Aigues-Mortes (south of Montpellier). The storm system initially moved up the lower Vidourle valley, causing significant rainfall in the Sommières area late in the evening of October 2. The phenomenon then gained in size and intensity, heading toward the Nîmes heights, first passing through the Vaunage plain, where 250 to nearly 400 mm of rain were recorded on average over the entire episode, particularly in Calvisson. Significant hailstorms were reported in the commune of Congénies around 4 a.m. The rainfall reached 50 mm or more per hour on average over a period of less than 12 hours, equating to six months of rain. The torrential storm then spread and stalled over the entire garrigue plateaus overlooking Nîmes toward Remoulins. At the Nîmes-Courbessac meteorological station, east of the city, 263 mm fell during the night of October 2 to 3. At Nîmes-Kennedy, 311 mm were recorded by 1 p.m. The most intense rainfall core recorded was 420 mm at Mas-de-Ponge, on the heights northwest of the city. This considerable value is, however, underestimated because the rain gauge stopped transmitting data for about forty minutes during the episode. Locally, 500 mm may have been recorded, equivalent to two-thirds of the annual rainfall. The karst networks quickly became saturated, charging all the cadereaux toward the city center. However, the rainfall was relatively localized, as only 35 mm were recorded at Nîmes-Garons airport, just 6 km southeast of the city. The very tight isohyet curves during the event are typical of stationary storm phenomena. The Nîmes urban area, located at the confluence of cadereaux, at the foot of the limestone plateaus of the garrigues, is particularly prone to flood risks from runoff. The first indications of flooding in Nîmes date back to the 14th century. Historical chronicles notably mention two major disasters equivalent to that of October 3, 1988: August 29, 1399, and September 9, 1557."

In a study published in 2016, it is mentioned that there were actually two floods in 1983, the first on February 1 and the second on March 18. This event occurred due to the historic rise of the Piraí River, which flows west of the city of Santa Cruz. Due to torrential rain in the river's upper basin, it caused destruction along a stretch of more than 100 kilometers between the valleys and the alluvial plain, and as it advanced over flat terrain, the overflow reached a front about 10 kilometers wide, moving earth in its path. The flood destroyed the Tarumá bridge and wiped out the town of El Chorrito, in the municipality of El Torno, and reached Santa Cruz, flooding the botanical garden, the Ambrosio Villarroel neighborhood, and the entire western area of the city. The flood also caused hundreds of deaths and left 3,000 families homeless."

Intense rains washed away valuable topsoil along with growing crops in many places. The impact of the flood was partially mitigated by the Dalešice, Mostiště, Vranov, and Vír reservoirs, while the under-construction Nové Mlýny Waterworks was slightly damaged. In Velké Meziříčí, the high water surpassed a record that coincidentally occurred on May 21, 1781. The Balinka stream flooded the main square to a height of half a meter, peaking on May 21 at 10:00 a.m.—at that moment, around 110 houses in the city center were flooded up to 1.5 meters, and tires from the local retreading cooperative Obnova's warehouse were scattered throughout the city. The Oslava River then flooded almost the entire area of the second-largest Czech cable factory, Kablo Velké Meziříčí. After the water receded, holes and trenches up to two meters deep appeared in the square. However, most retail establishments managed to resume operations by Saturday, May 25. The Jihlava River reached a historically record height: in Ivančice on May 22, 1985, it recorded the highest water level of 536 cm (31 mm higher than the previous record on March 20, 1947). Its tributary, the Jihlávka, flooded the area of the Jihlava Zoo on the same day, where employees, in cooperation with the army, waded through waist-deep water to rescue endangered animals and faced the threat that the dam of the Staré plovárny, half a kilometer upstream, might break, which would have posed a significantly greater danger. However, the dam held, and the water receded that afternoon. Several dozen kilometers downstream, in Pohořelice, the Jihlava River flooded around 350 houses. The rivers Svratka (for example, the poultry plant area in Modřice was flooded) and Dyje also overflowed their banks, with the Dyje threatening its surroundings as far as Břeclav and being the only river to remain at the third flood stage as late as Monday, May 27."

Moist, warm oceanic air coming from the west collided with cooler air, resulting in significant rainfall. Between January 28 and February 26, only one rain-free day was recorded in Herford, on February 14, 1946. From February 8 to 9 alone, 130 liters per square meter fell, one-fifth of the annual rainfall. Herford had already been affected by floods in the weeks prior, but these amounts led to the most severe natural disaster known in the region. Due to a shortage of firewood after World War II, the surrounding forests were also cleared, leaving the soil unable to absorb water. As a result, the Werre and Aa rivers overflowed their banks in a very short time. Debris from the railway bridge on the Herford-Altenbeken line, destroyed by air raids and still lying in the Werre, significantly hindered the river's water flow and caused a massive backup above the railway embankment, reaching up to the top of the tracks. Under the pressure of the 1.5 million cubic meters of water that had accumulated, the railway embankment broke in four places on the morning of February 9. With tremendous force, the floodwaters poured into the lower-lying city area, flooding almost the entire city center. In the process, they caused devastating damage to houses and riverbanks."

Fatally, the flood wave of the Aa – usually occurring four to six hours earlier than that of the Werre – coincided with it. The masses of water also tore away the Hansa Bridge, which stood just behind the confluence of the Aa into the Werre, interrupting the route of the Herford narrow-gauge railway until May 1949."

Upstream in Bad Salzuflen, the Werre and in Lemgo, the Bega overflowed their banks and flooded almost the entire Neustadt. One cause was that the weir at the Langenbrücker Gate was under ice and could no longer be opened. Due to snowmelt and rain, the water accumulated and found its way through the streets of Lemgo, where the water level reached up to one meter. In some areas, the city could only be navigated by boat. The Bega flows into the Werre in Bad Salzuflen, with the Bega carrying more water there than the Werre. Downstream in Löhne, parts of the river-adjacent districts of Löhne-Ort, Gohfeld, Mennighüffen, and Obernbeck were flooded, with Obernbeck being the most affected. In Bad Oeynhausen, where the Werre flows into the Weser, parts of Dehme and Rehme were submerged in the floods. A day earlier, a dam along the Werre had broken over a length of 40 meters, which was only repaired two years later. In the Sielpark, a large landscaped park north of the spa park between the Hamm–Minden railway line and the Werre, there was a water level of two meters, leaving the area underwater. The lower-lying properties along the Werre and Kaarbach, which flows into the Werre in the Sielpark area, were affected by the flooding. The Werste fire department was on duty day and night, supplying the affected population with essentials using inflatable boats. However, not only the southern parts of Werste were severely hit, but also farms along the Weser. There were also floods along the Weser in Minden."

By July 20, news of the total destruction of Fort Pringles (now Guardia Mitre) and Fort San Javier reached Viedma. The town of General Conesa was completely submerged on July 23. Governor José Eugenio Tello ordered the construction of defensive embankments along the coastal area of the city of Viedma. However, on July 18, the city began to be attacked by the water. On July 21, at eight in the morning, the embankments ordered by the governor broke, and the waters advanced over the city. The government house was abandoned by employees in boats, and the prisoners from the jail were transferred to the Patagones police station. The residents who had remained in the city were rescued by vessels such as the Limay steamer. On July 25, the only building still standing was the Salesian College, which managed to withstand the waters. That same day, the flood reached parts of Patagones; however, the high areas of the city remained intact. On July 27, the waters reached their highest level, and only three days later, they began to recede. In addition to being flooded by the river, Viedma was primarily inundated by the El Juncal lagoon, a large body of water located behind the city, stretching from the Zanjón de Oyuela to near the mouth of the Negro River. After the flood, the capital of the territory began to rebuild, but the people of Viedma faced the great challenge of drying the lagoon. Its drainage and evaporation took until the 1930s."

Around 4:00 PM, the city experienced controlled rainfall, which had not yet caused significant damage but was gradually becoming more intense, and just five minutes later, the rain increased in intensity, with the drainage system struggling to handle the substantial amount of water accumulating on the streets. By around 4:30 PM, a violent storm hit the city, and by 5:00 PM, the city was effectively paralyzed, traffic came to a standstill, and police authorities began managing traffic to prevent emergency vehicles from getting stuck. During this time, many main roads were closed to traffic after about an hour of relentless rain, which allowed water to accumulate in underpasses and tunnels, reaching up to 4 meters in depth at the deepest point. In the outskirts of the city at the foot of the Palermo Mountains (such as the area of Baida), mud and stone flows rushed furiously downhill toward the city center. Numerous local police officers worked to redirect traffic on the Ring Road (the city's main artery connecting the A19 to the A29) and on parallel streets, forcing drivers to reverse their direction of travel. Meanwhile, firefighters used their amphibious vehicle to navigate the deepest areas. By 6:00 PM that same day, the rain gave way to a clear sky, allowing the people of Palermo to observe the extensive damage.\n\nOn the same day, numerous firefighters and civil protection volunteers began working to clear all the roads of the mass of mud obstructing passage. This operation continued day and night in the following days. On July 16, 2020, the mayor of Palermo requested that a state of natural disaster be declared, and the following day, the intervention of the army was necessary to speed up the work."

The major flood of the Jialing River and the flood of the Jinsha River converged in Chongqing, forming an extraordinary flood in the main stream of the Yangtze River.

According to records from Wanxian, the estimated 30-day flood volume was approximately 165 billion cubic meters. The flow at Yichang was about 105,000 cubic meters per second. After the Qing River joined, the peak flow at Zhicheng Station reached 110,000 cubic meters per second. \n\nIn the northern Jingjiang area, multiple breaches occurred below Jianli, turning the Jianghan Plain into a vast expanse of water. On the southern bank of the Yangtze River, a breach at Songzi created the Songzi River, which directly discharged into Dongting Lake, leaving houses and farmland along the way completely destroyed. Modern scholars, based on stone inscriptions in places like Baxian, determined that the flood occurred from the 13th to the 21st of June [Reference 1]. After the flood, Sichuan Governor Wu Tang reported the disaster situation in eastern Sichuan. On the Renchen day in July, the Qing court responded, instructing Wu Tang to handle the disaster together with the provincial administration and dismissing Xu Junyong, the magistrate of Fengdu County, from his position [Reference 2]. \n\nIn 1952, the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission conducted an investigation into this flood and concluded that it was the largest flood among the eight major historical floods of the Yangtze River from 1153 to the end of the 20th century, as well as among the five major floods measured in the 20th century [References 3, 4, 5]."

                "content": "Months later, the Catalan Water Agency (ACA) commissioned a study from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia - BarcelonaTech (UPC). The results linked a series of conditions that occurred during the night of October 22, 2019: Data from the Meteoprades weather stations added to the UPC study show that the highest rainfall values were recorded in Vilanova de Prades with 299 l/m²; Prades, with 293 l/m²; Tossal de la Baltasana with 240.6 l/m²; Alforja, with 264 l/m²; La Pobla de Cérvoles, with 254 l/m²; l'Aleixar, with 240 l/m²; Capafonts with 232 l/m²; Ulldemolins, with 220 l/m² and Les Masies (l'Espluga de Francolí) with 174 l/m². With these conditions, the rise in flow in the mentioned rivers and ravines was very rapid. In the counties of Pla de Lleida, Garrigues, Pla d'Urgell, and Urgell, the heavy downpours left roads and train tracks cut off and caused flooding of basements. It was the worst storm in the last fifty years in Pla de Lleida. However, in Conca de Barberà, the wave was deadly, as the waters descending from the Prades mountains, the Vilobí range, and the Vinaixa valley, which flow into Conca de Barberà at the height of Vimbodí and Poblet, were joined by water from torrents and streams on both sides of the Francolí river. This significant water flow was accompanied by a large amount of trees and material it had dragged along, known as solid flow. Between Vimbodí and Poblet, l'Espluga de Francolí, Montblanc, and Vilaverd, it resulted in a flood that uprooted all vegetation and trees in its path. The water flowed at high speed while trees and reeds created blockages, either by entangling with the vegetation of the riverbed or by clogging bridges. The peak flow, caused by water retention at some point upstream, reached unprecedented levels according to estimates made by the UPC. For example, the Milans river, which flows into l'Espluga de Francolí, recorded flows far above usual: 351 m³/s as it passed through Vimbodí and Poblet when it usually does not exceed 0.5 m³/s. At l'Espluga, flows reached up to 1,200 m³/s at the Palanca bridge when the usual flow is between 0.5 and 1 m³/s. Downstream, in Montblanc, before the first rains, only a trickle of water flowed, with just 0.2 m³/s. But in just 5 minutes, between 10:10 and 10:15 p.m., it went from 2 to 185 m³/s. In summary, a giant unstoppable wave occurred in Conca de Barberà. The magnitude of the rise was so large that the wave reached Tarragona city two hours later. If days earlier the flow was 1 m³/s, the wave was so extraordinary and exceptional that at 12:15 a.m., the river was already carrying 63 m³/s and suddenly rose to 1,238 m³/s at 12:30 a.m. The UPF study estimated that the Francolí river had carried away about 43,000 trees (14,000 m³ of wood) and had devastated a forested area of 160 hectares. Days later, pebbles and gravel came to dominate the riverbed, and many areas were left with bare rock. In the Lleida plain, in another hydraulic basin, the impacts were smaller and corresponded to the riverbeds of the Set river, the Corb river, the Ondara river, the Femosa torrent, and the Canals clamor."

                "content": "Beyond the loss of trees and desolation, the flood caused four deaths and two more people who, a year later, remain missing. In Espluga de Francolí, one of the most affected towns, the flood swept away the Rendé Masdéu Winery, the El Celler restaurant located above it, and a playground. The active tourism company Drac Actiu S.L., located at the confluence of the Milans and Francolí rivers, the Fonda Les Disset Fonts, and the Funeconca funeral home also suffered severe damage. Downstream, in Montblanc, the medieval bridge withstood the force of the waters but was seriously damaged and obstructed, and the water carried away everything in its path, mainly orchards, irrigation channels, and small constructions. From the following day, firefighters, civil protection, and security forces began cleaning and protection tasks. At the same time, there was a significant citizen response: many volunteers helped with cleaning and reconstruction tasks and organized themselves. Civil society created \"Riuada solidària al Francolí,\" an entity that organized a flood of activities to raise funds so that those affected could revive local businesses and restore the damaged areas. The citizen platform collected 152,396 euros as direct aid for those affected in the municipalities of Espluga de Francolí and Montblanc. State aid was slower. Until the summer of 2020, on August 27, the Official State Gazette (BOE) published a Royal Decree that launched a regime of aid to local entities for the recovery of areas affected by the October 2019 storm and the Gloria storm at the beginning of 2020. Various municipalities in Conca de Barberà stated that the measure came late. For example, according to the mayor of Espluga de Francolí, Josep M. Vidal, they had certified the damages, but in no case did they receive the aid they had been waiting for over ten months. In Conca de Barberà, at the beginning of 2021, many buildings and heritage assets were still pending repair. A similar situation occurred in nine towns in Les Garrigues, with Arbeca and Vinaixa being the most affected municipalities, still waiting for subsidies to repair roads and facilities valued at around five million euros."

                "content": "As with other floods in Saint Petersburg, the cause was cyclones with strong winds coming from the Gulf of Finland, which pushed Baltic waves against the Neva River's currents. A contributing factor was the abnormally high level of precipitation in the region in 1923 and 1924, which oversaturated the soil and raised the levels of the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga. On the morning of September 23, there were no signs of the impending flood, but by noon, a strong westerly wind began to blow, and the water level in the Neva started to rise rapidly. At 1:20 PM, five cannon shots from the Peter and Paul Fortress signaled a water rise of 5 feet, followed by shots every half hour, and later every 15 minutes. Around 3 PM, water began flooding Vasilyevsky Island from both the west and east. Other parts of the city soon followed, primarily Admiralty Island and the Petrograd Side. Streets were submerged, basements used as storage, engine rooms, and housing for the poorest residents were flooded. In some areas, the first floors of buildings were underwater. The city's widespread wooden block pavements were destroyed; their wooden blocks, along with floating firewood, clogged the streets and obstructed movement even after the water receded. After 7 PM, the flood reached its peak, with the water level exceeding the ordinary mark by up to 380 centimeters, second only to the flood of a century earlier, which reached 369.4 cm. Fires broke out in various parts of the city, including at an explosives factory on Vatny Island. Soon, the water level began to drop rapidly, and after 10 PM, residents who had taken refuge on the upper floors of buildings were able to return home. By midnight, the water had receded to 1 meter above the ordinary mark. Martial law was declared in Leningrad, and in the following days, the city began recovery efforts with local and external assistance. Official data estimated the death toll at 16 people, a figure that eyewitnesses found highly questionable. In a 1986 study, hydrologist Alexei Sokolov estimated the death toll at 600. Over 15,000 families were left homeless. In the Petrogradsky District, 2,040 buildings were flooded, 1,460 in the Central District, 912 on Vasilyevsky Island, 660 in the Moskovsko-Narvsky District, 80 in the Vyborgsky District, and 67 in the Volodarsky District. The flood destroyed 19 city bridges, including the Sampsonievsky and Grenadersky bridges, and damaged dozens more. Two million square meters of pavement and 120 tram cars were damaged, 550 trees in the Summer Garden and on the spit of Yelagin Island were destroyed. The port and many factories were damaged, telephone communication was disrupted, and the most severely affected were the Krasny Putilovets and Russian Diesel plants. Forty ships sank or were washed ashore. The railway line to Sestroretsk was particularly damaged. The material damage from the flood was estimated at 130 million rubles. The Main Geophysical Observatory faced criticism for its forecast of a water level rise on September 23 of no more than 4 feet. The floods in Leningrad and the fight against them received significant attention from the press and leading scientists. In 1925, at the request of the provincial executive committee, a book titled \"Leningrad in the Fight Against the Flood\" was published, describing both the scientific aspects of the floods and the efforts to combat them and their consequences. The construction of a dam in the Harbor was announced. A few years later, a project for hydraulic structures to protect the city was presented, but the construction of such a complex only began in the late 1970s. On November 20, 1924, a postal-charity issue of postage stamps titled \"To Aid Flood-Stricken Leningrad\" was released."

For comparison, the average discharge of the Ahr at its mouth is about 8 m³/s, and the highest value measured at the Altenahr gauge before the 2021 flood was 236 m³/s (flood on June 2, 2016). The flood delayed the expansion of the Ahr Valley Railway and destroyed scaffolding, canteens, and almost all road bridges. The damage to private households and municipalities in the districts of Adenau and Ahrweiler amounted to about 2.7 million marks (equivalent to about 19.1 million EUR today). In addition, there were destructions during railway construction and damages to state buildings. The damage was distributed with 1.5 million to the Adenau district and 1.2 million to the Ahrweiler district. In the 1920s, concrete plans for flood protection were developed due to the 1910 flood disaster. These included flood retention basins that could have held a total of 11.3 million cubic meters of water. However, these plans were postponed in favor of the construction of the Nürburgring and have not been realized to this day."

The damages were immense: reports to the (then French) government mentioned 129 residential houses, 162 barns or stables, 18 mills, and 8 forges as completely destroyed. 469 residential houses, 234 barns or stables, two mills, and one forge were heavily damaged. 78 horses and draft cattle were reported drowned, and much other livestock must have drowned. The vineyards and fruit trees in the Ahr Valley were largely destroyed. Nearly all bridges collapsed, with almost 30 bridges mentioned. This also applied to the stone bridges, including the Ahr Bridge in Rech. In Altenburg, the chapel was swept away, and a new one was built afterward. In Mayschoß, a bridge, eight residential houses, as well as an equal number of barns or stables, and one forge were destroyed. 55 residential buildings and 55 barns or stables suffered very severe damage.

On December 24, 1740, the dikes near Bemmel and Elden broke. Although there were few human casualties during the breaches, the material damage was significant. Livestock drowned en masse. The dikes could only be repaired in April. Due to the prolonged duration, the wind, and the drifting ice, many homes were damaged. For example, in Bleskensgraaf, only three houses remained undamaged, and in Ottoland, not a single house was spared. In the eyes of many, the dike breaches and floods were instruments of God to punish the people of the Netherlands for their sins. Reverend Wilhelmus Themmen, a minister in Arnhem, dedicated a book to it in 1741 titled: \"God's Righteous Judgment with the Inhabitants of the Netherlands through the Violence of Winds and Waters.\" He also provided the motives: \"To sensibly punish the flood of their escalating sins through the flood of overflowing rivers, and to warn the careless crowd against the roaring of enemy nations; so that the land and church are not suddenly overrun and devoured with all their splendor by their military might.\" Reverend Themmen likely referred to the threats to the Republic from the War of the Austrian Succession. He was not alone in his view that the flood was a chastisement from God for the sins of the people. In the Over-Betuwe region, five deaths were reported. In the Alblasserwaard region, there is mention of \"a few.\" The low number of casualties can be explained by eyewitness accounts stating that the water rose slowly, providing sufficient opportunity to flee to attics and often higher-located churches. The rescue work and emergency relief in 1741 were primarily the responsibility of surrounding cities and private aid committees."

After two weeks of frost, the thaw began. This caused the river water to rise, while much of the ice had not yet disappeared. This was feared by the residents due to the danger of flooding caused by accumulating ice.  \nOn January 21, the water in Ameide reached the crest of the dike. Throughout the river region, dikes were hastily reinforced. However, from Streefkerk to Krimpen, the ice formed a dam, causing the water to back up. The pressure on the dikes became so great that the dike of the Krimpenerwaard broke. Additionally, an ice dam had formed, stretching from Gorinchem to Hardinxveld-Giessendam. On February 1, 1726, the dike between Ochten and Dodewaard broke. The Haaften preacher Rev. Thiele wrote the following about it in his book \"Schouwburg der Oordelen en Gerigten Gods\": \"The high water broke the dike/ which collapsed with a terrible crash/ devastated the nearby orchards and arable lands/ covered them with water and sand/ and within a few hours flooded the Nederbetuwe from the Waal dike to the Lek dike/ so that in the morning, at daybreak, one could see the rushing water foaming past the city of Thiel/ with a terrible noise/ and from there over the Linge dike/ which from the Thiel sluice (draining into the Linge opposite Teedingsweerd) took away the entire crest of the Linge dike up to Wadenoyen.\" In the Bommelerwaard as well, the dikes broke in several places. On February 7, the Linge dike near Kedichem broke. Large areas were now underwater. The combination of the long duration and persistent westerly winds caused extensive damage. One writer says: \"Everywhere one saw goods, chests, cabinets, and other household items floating; heartbreaking was the lamentation of the women, the crying of the children, the shouting and complaints of the men, and the bellowing of the animals; many had to leave their homes and seek refuge on the dikes with their offspring and livestock; others, whose houses were in danger of being swept away by the water, had to be rescued with small boats, and so everyone parted from their homes, not knowing if they would ever find them again.\""

                "content": "In August 2021, due to a pressure pattern close to the end of the rainy season, and the influence of an active front, record-breaking heavy rain occurred over a wide area across the country. In northern Kyushu, rainfall exceeded 1,000 millimeters from the 11th, with some areas reaching 50% of their annual rainfall in less than a week. This led to frequent occurrences of river flooding, landslides, and road collapses. Additionally, many buses, railways, and other transportation systems were suspended, and highway and national road closures occurred one after another. In Yaotsu Town, Kamo District, Gifu Prefecture, damage from a tornado was also reported. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued \"Emergency Heavy Rain Warnings\" and \"General Meteorological Information on Significant Heavy Rain\" due to the formation of linear precipitation bands in various areas. The total accumulated rainfall for mid-August (11th to 20th), calculated from 1,029 AMeDAS points nationwide since 1982, was 235,788.5 millimeters (229.1 millimeters per point), surpassing the record set during the July 2018 heavy rain (Western Japan Heavy Rain). On August 13, the government upgraded the Information Liaison Office at the Prime Minister's Office Crisis Management Center to the Prime Minister's Office Liaison Office. On the same morning, the government held a \"Meeting of Relevant Cabinet Ministers on Heavy Rain Centered in Western Japan\" at the Prime Minister's Office. Then-Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga instructed the establishment of a Specific Disaster Response Headquarters to prepare for disasters caused by the record-breaking heavy rain. That afternoon, a Specific Disaster Response Headquarters was established, headed by then-Minister for Disaster Management Yasufumi Tanahashi. As of 7:00 p.m. on the 14th, \"Emergency Safety Measures\" were issued for seven prefectures (Nagano, Gifu, Shimane, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Saga, and Nagasaki) covering 820,000 households and 1.81 million people. By the morning of the 15th, the measures were issued for six prefectures (Chiba, Nagano, Shimane, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, and Saga) covering 260,000 households and 580,000 people. Additionally, in Yamakita Town and Matsuda Town in Ashigarakami District, Kanagawa Prefecture, and Himi City in Toyama Prefecture, torrential rain exceeding 100 millimeters per hour was recorded, prompting the issuance of \"Record-Breaking Short-Term Heavy Rain Information.\" According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 13 deaths were confirmed nationwide due to the series of heavy rains. The Disaster Relief Act was applied to 21 municipalities in Nagano, Shimane, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Saga, and Nagasaki Prefectures."

It was the largest heavy rainfall in the Han River basin since the Great Flood of 1925, with an average rainfall of 452mm in the central region and a record-high water level of 13.63m above sea level and a height of 13.70m at the Jamsu Bridge observation point. The Han River basin also recorded its highest water level of 11.27m at around 6:30 PM on September 11, issuing the sixth flood warning in history. The disaster resulted in 126 deaths, 37 missing persons, a total of 163 casualties, and 187,265 flood victims. The northern embankment near Haengju Bridge in the lower Han River collapsed, flooding the Goyang County area in Gyeonggi Province and causing massive damage. Despite the discharge from Chungju Dam, heavy rain caused flooding in the upper Namhan River, including the Danyang area in North Chungcheong Province, leading to flood damage in various parts of the central region."

This low-pressure system created a pressure trough due to the collision between the cold and dry continental high-pressure system and the hot and humid maritime high-pressure system over the southern seas of Japan, forming a strong rain cloud band that remained stationary. The stationary rain cloud band produced heavy concentrated rainfall centered around the Han River basin in the central region between the 10th and 12th."

Over four days, rainfall amounts were recorded as follows: 581.2 mm in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province; 529.6 mm in Suwon; 512.5 mm in Ganghwa; 508.9 mm in Hongcheon; 491.7 mm in Yangpyeong; and 486.2 mm in Seoul. At that time, Icheon and Suwon in Gyeonggi Province experienced continuous rainfall of 59 mm per hour. In particular, Suwon recorded a daily rainfall of 296.3 mm. On the 9th, heavy rain of 80-120 mm fell in the upper regions of the Bukhan River, including Toegyewon and Paldang in northern Gyeonggi Province. On the 10th, 100-150 mm of rain fell in most areas of the Han River's main stream and the Bukhan River basin, with some areas of the Namhan River recording up to 150 mm of rainfall. On the same day, at 10 a.m., the Central Meteorological Office issued a heavy rain advisory for Seoul and the Gyeonggi region, which was upgraded to a heavy rain warning at 2 p.m. with expected rainfall of 150-200 mm. Additionally, a heavy rain advisory was issued for Gangwon Province. As of the 9th, over 100 mm of heavy rain had already fallen in Seoul and the Gyeonggi region, resulting in two deaths and flooding of roads and houses in various locations. At around 8 p.m. on the 10th, a heavy rain warning was issued across the entire metropolitan area, and due to continued heavy rain, a flood advisory was issued for the Han River at 2 a.m. on the 11th, which was upgraded to a flood warning at 8 a.m. On the 11th, rainfall exceeded 200 mm across the entire Han River basin, with the Shinpung area near the Soyang River Dam recording a maximum rainfall of 620 mm. By the 12th, heavy rain had ceased in most areas, with light rain of around 10 mm continuing in the upper regions of the Chungju Dam. Overall, the concentrated heavy rain in the central region from the 9th to the 12th recorded an average rainfall of 452 mm over three days, marking the heaviest rainfall in 200 years."

In Beon 2-dong, Dobong-gu, Seoul, a 6-month-old baby boy died as his house was submerged due to heavy rain, and in the construction site behind Daejin High School in Hagye-dong, Nowon-gu, a 10-year-old boy fell into a 3-meter-deep pit and died. From the first day of heavy rain on the 9th, Tongil-ro was submerged, restricting traffic. The damage from the heavy rain in Seoul was mainly concentrated on the 11th. At around 4:40 PM on the 11th, a cruise ship belonging to Wonkwang Co., anchored at Yeouido dock, broke free due to the fast current and collided with a barge and another cruise ship belonging to Semo Co. Shortly after the collision, all three vessels were swept away by the strong current, and the barge \"Nodeul Naruho\" and two cruise ships, \"Wonkwangho\" and \"Nodeulho,\" were swept away or collided up to Mapo Bridge, causing damage to the bridge. The \"Wonkwangho\" avoided collision by starting its engine just before hitting Mapo Bridge, but the \"Nodeulho\" sank after colliding with the bridge, leaving three crew members missing and injuring about 30 crew members from the \"Nodeulho\" and the barge. Additionally, Mapo Bridge, damaged by the collision with the barge, was temporarily closed to traffic. At that time, a flood from the upper reaches of the Han River flowed entirely into the river, significantly raising its water level. The water level at Hangang In-dogyo reached a peak of 11.27 meters on September 11, far exceeding the danger level of 10.5 meters. Several bridges on the Han River, including Jamsil Railway Bridge, were submerged up to their piers on the 11th, and the Noryangjin area, including the fish market, was completely flooded. The tributary of Anyangcheon, Gaebongcheon, overflowed, submerging Gaebong-dong, and the area around Gaebong Station was entirely underwater. The area around Noryangjin Station was also submerged up to the chest level of an adult male, leading to a complete suspension of the Gyeongin Line from the morning of the 11th. In addition, in Gahoe-dong, Jongno-gu, the roof of a hanok village collapsed due to heavy rain early on the 11th, killing a family of three. At that time, 152 companies in the Guro Industrial Complex area were submerged, causing industrial damage. The embankments of the Han River collapsed in several places, completely submerging areas such as Pungnap-dong, Cheonho-dong, and Seongnae-dong in Gangdong-gu to a height of 1-1.5 meters, including the Gangdong-gu Office building. Over 150 people were rescued by helicopter and about 600 by boat from the flooded areas. Seongnae-dong and Pungnap-dong suffered the worst flooding in six years since the 1984 Han River flood. In Gangnam-gu, areas such as Suseo-dong, Segok-dong, around Yangjae Pumping Station, and Yangjae-dong were flooded, forcing 500 households to evacuate. Low-lying areas like Samseong-dong and Daechi-dong were also completely submerged. In Yongsan-gu, areas such as Yongsan 5-ga, Cheongpa 1-ga, Hangang 1-ga, Wonhyo 3-ga, and parts of Bogwang-dong were also flooded. Many schools in Seoul were affected, with 15 schools, including Gaebong Elementary School, Pungnap Middle School, and Sudong Middle School, being flooded on the 11th, and six schools, including Daeseong High School and Seocho Middle School, suffering damage such as retaining wall collapses due to the heavy rain."

During the heavy rainfall, the highest amount of rain fell nationwide, and in Goyang County, the collapse of the Han River embankment caused the most significant damage. Additionally, three water purification plants, including the Gyeongan purification plant in Gwangju County, were submerged, resulting in water supply disruptions for over 50,000 households and power outages for 12,000 households. On the 11th, the overflow of Anyangcheon and Mokgamcheon rivers caused flooding in most areas of low-lying districts in Gwangmyeong City, such as Gwangmyeong 1, 2, 3, and 7-dong, Cheolsan 1-dong, Haan 1-dong, and Soa 1-dong, displacing over 11,000 people from 3,000 households. In Uiwang City, over 620 mm of heavy rain fell in a single day on the 11th, leaving more than 2,600 residents from 635 households in six districts displaced. In Gunpo City, 280 households and 900 people were displaced on the 11th. Northern Gyeonggi Province also suffered damage. On the 11th, a landslide occurred on the hillside of Bullori in Gimpo County due to heavy rain, burying the dormitory of Geumgang Industry, resulting in six deaths and nine rescues. Two people went missing at an aggregate extraction site in Gimpo County, and one person was swept away in Sangnongcheon, Goyang County. The overflow of Wangsukcheon displaced over 2,000 people from 510 households in Donong-ri, Migeum City, and caused flooding in most areas of Gyomun-ri, Supyeong-dong, and Sutaek-dong in Guri City, displacing 8,600 people from 2,200 households. Over 10,000 people were displaced in five cities and counties along Wangsukcheon. The overflow of the Imjin River also flooded the Gyoha Plain in Paju County. In Yangju County, 100 meters of the Jungnangcheon embankment in Namban-ri, Junae-myeon, was washed away, as well as the Chukseok Pass road in Ja-il-dong, Uijeongbu City. Additionally, 80 meters of the embankment near Obokgyo in Songsan-dong, Uijeongbu City, three water facilities in Sudong-myeon, Namyangju County, and 25 meters of embankments in five rivers were washed away. By the 11th, a total of 45 people had died in Gyeonggi Province alone. In addition to the aforementioned fatalities, five members of a family in Hwaseo-dong, Suwon City, were among the seven deaths in Suwon City, with two deaths each in Gwangju County and Seongnam County, and one death each in Yeoju County, Uiwang City, Gapyeong County, and five deaths in Yongin County."

The lower Han River embankment in Sinpyeong-ri, Jido-eup, Goyang County, collapsed, causing water to pour in, covering homes and farmland, spreading toward Neunggok and Ilsan, and flooding up to the vicinity of Sumaksan. At the time, the sudden flooding of the Han River in Goyang County submerged 5,000 hectares of farmland, and more than 50,000 displaced residents evacuated to high ground such as Haengju Fortress. The collapsed embankment was in an area with a narrow river width and weak ground, and demands for reinforcement and reconstruction had been continuously raised. It was pointed out during the 1984 flood as well, but it was left unattended, and the embankment, which had been leaking water since dawn, eventually collapsed. Due to the flooding in Goyang County, the Christian Broadcasting System (CBS) transmission station in Neunggok, Haengjunae-ri, Jido-eup, was flooded, causing a broadcasting interruption. Additionally, around 11 p.m. on the 12th, the Han River embankment in front of Sumaksan in Samyang-ri, Gyohwa-myeon, Paju County, also collapsed under water pressure, with a width of 5 meters and a length of 80 meters, but as it was an uninhabited area, there were no casualties. The flood situation near the collapsed Haengju Bridge embankment subsided from the 13th, as the Han River water receded and the ebb tide returned, and at the same time, restoration work on the Han River embankment was carried out to prevent further flood damage. The damaged Haengju Bridge Han River embankment was temporarily restored on September 18, six days after the flood, with the completion of water-blocking construction."

                "content": "The heavy rainstorm in Henan in August 2021 refers to the large-scale, persistent, and intense rainfall process dominated by the Huanghuai cyclone, which occurred from August 21, 2021, in Henan Province of the People's Republic of China and surrounding areas in North China. Since it occurred after the severe disaster of the Henan floods in July 2021, and multiple meteorological agencies and numerical models indicated an extreme trend in this round of rainfall, it received high attention and vigilance from all sectors in Henan. Before the arrival of the heavy rain, the Zhengzhou municipal government preemptively conducted preventive reservoir discharges, and several public transportation services were suspended due to the impact of this event.\n\nAccording to China Weather Network, starting from the afternoon of August 22, the rainfall intensity in Henan Province of the People's Republic of China significantly increased, and Zhengzhou issued the highest-level red alert for heavy rain. Between 12:00 and 15:00, torrential rain poured in local areas such as Pingdingshan, Jiaozuo, and Zhengzhou. The maximum three-hour rainfall occurred in Ligou Village, Lushan County, Pingdingshan City, at 138.1 mm, while the maximum hourly rainfall intensity was 80.4 mm in the same location. China Weather Network warned that all regions should also be alert to gusts with expected intensities reaching levels 7-9 accompanying the rainfall.\n\nChen Tao, chief forecaster of the National Meteorological Center, explained that from the system configuration perspective, this heavy rainfall process is a typical monsoon rainfall. The westward extension of the subtropical high allowed warm and moist airflows from the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, and Western Pacific to move smoothly northward along the western edge of the subtropical high, confronting cold air from the north, resulting in a large-scale rainfall process. \"Simply put, the northern cold air and the southwestern monsoon airflow clashed, collided, and interacted in the southwestern region and the Huanghuai area, forming a 'temperamental' low vortex and cyclone weather system.\" Zhang Tao believed that this heavy rain process in Henan was different from the \"7.20\" event. This rainfall process was mobile and would not replicate the \"stagnation\" of the July Henan floods, so the cumulative rainfall would not be particularly extreme."

Citizens are reminded to park their vehicles in a way that does not affect road traffic as much as possible and to move their vehicles to locations that do not obstruct traffic promptly after the heavy rain.\"  \n\nAt noon on August 22, the Zhengzhou City Flood Control Office issued a notice requiring the implementation of traffic control measures, including sealing and prohibiting passage at 67 urban bridge and tunnel crossings and 23 small railway bridge crossings. Zhengzhou traffic police announced that entrances and exits of tunnels such as the Jingguang Tunnel (south, central, and north sections), Weilai Road Tunnel, and Hongzhuan Road Tunnel have been closed, with personnel stationed on duty. As the rainfall intensified, Zhengzhou traffic police deployed officers to key intersections and road sections, including underpasses, bridges, water accumulation points, and tunnels, to carry out traffic security work.

                "content": "The flood in Western and Central Europe in 2021, also known as the 2021 flood disaster, was a natural disaster involving severe flash floods and flooding in several river basins in Central Europe during the summer of 2021. Particularly affected were parts of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and other neighboring countries. The most severe flooding was caused by the low-pressure system Bernd. Since early July 2021, warm stormy winds from France and over Piedmont, followed by a cool wind flow from the north with the upper low, reached Central Europe. This resulted in a large, relatively stationary low-pressure system due to a trough weather pattern. A very large amount of rainfall fell on the regions of eastern Belgium, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Rhineland-Palatinate, and later on the Jura-Central Alps area and subsequently in regions of the Eastern Alps and the Balkans. Continuous rain, severe thunderstorms, and heavy hailstorms hit the French regions of Grand Est and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, northwestern Switzerland, Ticino, Bavaria, and Saxony, as well as other areas. In many places, rivers, streams, and lakes overflowed, causing very high property damage and numerous fatalities. The water levels of some bodies of water reached similar heights as during the Alpine floods of 2005 and the floods in Switzerland in 2007 or even exceeded them. After about a week, the low-pressure system was over the Eastern Alps, where it slowly dissipated, still causing severe flooding in Bavaria and Austria. The course of the flooding varied in the different affected regions. While the heavy rainfall in some mountainous regions quickly caused rivers to swell enormously, leading to a rapidly rising but short-lived flooding downstream, the water accumulated elsewhere, such as in the Alpine foothill lakes in Switzerland and in flat areas downstream of large rivers like the Meuse, slowly and steadily, reaching peak levels only after days. The flood waves in some valley landscapes subsided after just a few hours, while flooding persisted for weeks in other areas. The flood had particularly devastating effects in the northeast of the Eifel, where towns along the Ahr, the upper part of the Erft, the Nette (Middle Rhine), and Nitzbach, the Rur, and its tributaries Inde, Merzbach, Vichtbach, and Wurm were severely affected. Many houses were undermined, swept away, and damaged by the floods; roads, railways, bridges, and other critical infrastructure were destroyed. Over 220 people died in the flood disaster, including at least 188 in Germany (see the enumeration in the article section on Germany) and 41 in Belgium. Measured by the number of victims, the flood is the deadliest natural disaster in Germany since the storm surge of 1962. In some affected countries, the enormous damage necessitated massive aid and rescue efforts. Munich Re estimated the damage at 46 billion euros, of which 33 billion euros were in Germany alone. This makes it, in terms of damage costs, the second most expensive natural disaster worldwide in 2021, after Hurricane Ida."

In May and June, a low-pressure weather pattern along the northern edge of the Alps repeatedly led to continuous rain. Several times, especially in the Rhine catchment area, there were severe weather events with strong thunderstorms and large hailstorms. On June 22, a debris flow caused significant damage in the center of the municipality of Cressier in the canton of Neuchâtel. At the beginning of July, there was a risk of flooding in some bodies of water in Switzerland."

                "content": "The low-pressure system Bernd was the starting point for the severe weather situation over Belgium and Germany between July 12 and 19. Initially, it caused flooding in Great Britain before moving over the Netherlands and Belgium into western Germany. The low-pressure system was enclosed between two high-pressure areas to the west and east. This combination brought warm and moist air from the Mediterranean region to Central Europe, leading to widespread precipitation. The main cause of the locally large amounts of rainfall was the slow movement of the low-pressure system. Warm and moist air masses from the east were brought together with milder air in the west by the low-pressure system. As a result, the warm, more humid air moved over the cooler air. The moisture contained in the warm air layer then precipitated. Due to the subsequent high-pressure system, which shifted from the British Isles to Central Europe, the precipitation moved toward southern Germany and Austria. On July 24, thunderstorms moved from northern to central Belgium, causing further heavy rainfall there."

                "header": "Impact of global warming",
                "content": "The occurrence of flooding and the intensity of heavy rainfall can be significantly classified as a consequence of global warming. Although in the affected region of Western Europe, similar precipitation events were expected approximately every 400 years in the past, their probability of occurrence has recently increased significantly. Additionally, similar heavy rainfall events could occur in the future even at lower temperatures than previously observed. Extreme weather events such as heat extremes, droughts, extreme precipitation, and severe tropical storms are increasingly occurring globally due to human-induced global warming. Numerous climate researchers and IPCC authors such as Stefan Rahmstorf, Friederike Otto, Sonia Seneviratne, Reto Knutti, and Ed Hawkins, as well as meteorologists like Özden Terli, Karsten Schwanke, and Andreas Friedrich, therefore cite climate change as a significant contributing and amplifying factor for severe weather events. The hydrologist Bruno Merz added that due to the previously unfamiliar intensification of the water cycle, such events are likely to become more frequent, longer-lasting, and more extreme in the future. The German Weather Service published a report on the weather event, which also provides a climatological assessment. For the occurrence of flooding, it is particularly important that warmer air can hold more water; this eventually precipitates as rain. According to Özden Terli, global warming also temporarily weakens the jet stream, causing weather patterns such as high or low-pressure systems to remain largely stationary in one location for extended periods instead of moving on. This exacerbates their regional impacts, such as heavy rainfall events or the heatwave in late June in North America. According to a study published in 2021 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, severe weather events with serious consequences are expected to become several times more frequent in Europe with ongoing climate change due to the slow movement and high saturation of low-pressure systems. Hayley Fowler, a climatologist at Newcastle University, stated: \"We assume that polar amplification is the reason for the slow movement and prolonged duration of weather systems in summer and autumn.\" As early as the late 1980s, the first, albeit relatively simple, climate models predicted an increase in heavy precipitation events and a simultaneous decrease in light precipitation events with advancing global warming. According to Stefan Rahmstorf, this development is now also evident in measurement data. Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, research group leader at the Geographical Institute of Humboldt University in Berlin, explained that in 2021, \"the question is no longer whether climate change contributed to it.\" The only question is \"how much\" it contributed. Such connections are being studied in attribution research. Regarding the question of whether a change in the persistence of individual weather patterns can be observed in the context of climate change, the German Weather Service points out that studies currently do not present a consistent picture and that natural variability will obscure the signal in the coming decades. The same applies to studies linking the reduced temperature gradient between high and mid-latitudes, due to the increased temperature rise in the Arctic, and the persistence of the jet stream. In August 2021, the World Weather Attribution team published an attribution study on the events between July 15 and 17. They also found that there are significant uncertainties regarding the individual event. Therefore, they analyzed to what extent climate change made a similar event in Western Europe more likely and more intense. For the heavy rainfall event in the Ahr and Erft regions as well as in the Belgian Meuse, they determined, assuming the climate remains as it is now, a return period of 400 years. Based on climate simulations, they concluded that the one-day precipitation event increased by 3 to 19% and became 1.2 to 9 times more likely compared to a planet that was 1.2°C cooler and not warmed by humans. Similar findings applied to the two-day precipitation event. They also found that with a 2-degree warming compared to pre-industrial times, a further increase of 0.8 to 6% and a further increase in probability by a factor of 1.2 to 1.4 is to be expected. According to the 2021 annual report of the Copernicus Earth Observation Program, the summer months of 2021 were about one degree Celsius warmer than the average of the years 1991 to 2020."

                "content": "In the heavily affected Ahr Valley (Ahrweiler district), there were already severe floods in 1601, 1804, and 1910, some with higher flood peaks. In response to the 1910 flood, extensive flood retention basins with a capacity of 11.5 million cubic meters were planned in the 1920s in the upper reaches of the Ahr, at Trierbach, in the Wirftbach Valley, and at Adenauer Bach. Due to a lack of funds, the plans were not implemented, and instead, the Nürburgring was built. The situation was exacerbated in the 1970s when streams were straightened during land consolidation, and drainage channels were created in the vineyards, which directed rainfall vertically down the slopes, causing water levels in the valley to rise rapidly. Additionally, the typical slate rock is almost impermeable to water, causing heavy rain to simply run off. The side streams are also very steep, giving the water high velocity and causing water levels in the valley to rise quickly. According to geographers Thomas Roggenkamp and Jürgen Herget, the flood hazard map for the Ahr Valley is based on measurement data collected since 1947. Although the uncertainties of extreme value statistics with small sample sizes are known, the severe flood events of past centuries were not considered in the hazard assessment. In their view, the July 2021 flood is a recurrence of the July 1804 flood. Despite comparable flow rates (water volumes in cubic meters per second), the July 2021 flood reached higher water levels than the 1804 flood. The reason is that today's denser development of the floodplain reduced the flow area, causing water levels to rise disproportionately in certain areas. Local flood forecasts are under development. In recent years, the federal government and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate have promoted renaturation measures in the Ahr Valley. According to Wolfgang Büchs, these were sensible measures, but flood retention basins and other rainwater retention facilities – also in the side valleys – are the only effective measures against extreme rainfall events. Karsten Schwanke describes how the rainfall in the Eifel caused severe damage: The water was channeled through the low mountain range terrain there, leading to rapidly rising water levels in smaller streams, which in turn contributed to the flooding. The initial situation involved saturated soils due to a very wet spring and the low-pressure system \"Bernd,\" whose cloud masses released over the low mountain ranges in the region, resulting in \"intense rainfall of 150 to 200 liters per square meter within 48 hours.\" At several stations, such as in Rheinbach-Todenfeld or Cologne-Stammheim, more than 150 millimeters/liters per m² of precipitation were measured within 24 hours – between July 14 and 15, 2021, at 8 a.m. each day – with up to 148 millimeters in northern Rhineland-Palatinate, significantly more than the average rainfall for the entire month of July. The 154 millimeters in Stammheim were the highest value ever measured in Cologne within 24 hours and far exceeded the previous record of the last 75 years (95 millimeters). It was also an unusual event in that more than 100 millimeters of rain fell over such a large area – from Sauerland through the Bergisches Land and Cologne to the Eifel – something that had not been observed in previous decades. The Rhine region was most affected by the flood. Never before had there been such large amounts of rainfall here since the beginning of weather records. In Belgium, too, there were several record measurements, ranging from 190 to 270 liters per square meter of precipitation within 48 hours. Other factors that can exacerbate the situation during heavy rainfall include soil sealing, deforestation, dried-out soils, and missing or improperly dimensioned flood protection measures, including in low mountain streams that had previously rarely been considered a risk. The exact water levels in some cases can no longer be determined, as measuring devices stopped reporting data. Either they were not designed for the water levels reached or were destroyed by the water."

On July 15, the state infrastructure operator Infrabel announced the suspension of rail traffic throughout the region. There was a risk of flooding across the entire province of Liège as well as parts of the provinces of Luxembourg, Namur, and Walloon Brabant. In Liège, the Royal Meteorological Institute (KMI) measured 271.5 millimeters (271.5 liters per square meter) of rain in the municipality of Jalhay within 48 hours. During the same period, 217.1 millimeters (mm) of rain fell in the municipality of Spa and 192.4 mm in Mont Rigi. Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden activated the EU disaster relief procedure. Neighboring France announced the deployment of aid workers to the province of Liège. In the area of the German-speaking Community, the Our River overflowed its banks and flooded the village of Ouren, part of Burg-Reuland. In Belgium, at least 41 people died in total. As of July 27, 2021, two people were still reported missing. Several houses collapsed, including at least twelve in Pepinster – at the confluence of the Vesdre and Hoëgne rivers. At times, approximately 20,000 people were without electricity, and there was also contamination of drinking water. In Eupen, TNT explosives were washed ashore; an area was evacuated before they were defused. To manage the large amounts of destroyed belongings, the decommissioned Highway 601 was used as a storage site. North of Liège, debris and bulky waste were piled up along a 10-kilometer stretch. Large portions of the waste can also be recycled here. For the Flemish Region, damages were estimated at a total of 90 to 123 million euros. In contrast, the final assessment in January 2023 determined damages in the Walloon Region amounted to 1.993 billion euros. On July 24, severe storms occurred again in the province of Namur. These moved from the north from the province of Antwerp, causing heavy rainfall and flooding, especially in Dinant. Additionally, landslides occurred in the province of Walloon Brabant."

                "content": "In mid-July 2021, the low-pressure system Bernd caused heavy rainfall in several regions of Germany between July 12 and 19. Within 24 hours, particularly on July 14, 2021, more than 150 mm of rain fell in some areas, including 154 mm in Cologne-Stammheim. The German Weather Service estimated the recurrence interval of such an event to be more than 100 years and possibly 1,000 years. These volumes of rain caused severe flooding. North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate were particularly affected. On July 16, 2021, Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer declared a military disaster alert for the two federal states to enhance the Bundeswehr's ability to provide disaster relief. Due to the severe storms, at least 180 people died in the two federal states, including five firefighters on duty. Even after initial assessments, the death toll was significantly higher than during the 2002 \"century flood,\" when 21 people died in Germany. As the floodwaters reached several substations, power supply companies shut off electricity in those areas. 200,000 people in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate were affected by power outages. For more than 100,000 people, this lasted at least until the afternoon of July 16. Mobile networks and drinking water supplies also collapsed in some affected areas. To ensure emergency civilian communication via the internet, Starlink (satellite internet from SpaceX, which was in the testing phase at the time) set up several satellite dishes in the affected regions in coordination with government authorities. The railway infrastructure also suffered severe damage: railway lines in the Eifel region, such as the Cologne–Gerolstein–Trier connection and the Ahr Valley Railway, were particularly affected. Deutsche Bahn initially estimated damages at around 1.3 billion euros. Among other things, 180 level crossings, nearly 40 signal boxes, over 1,000 overhead line and signal masts, and 600 kilometers of tracks were destroyed, as well as power supply systems, elevators, and lighting systems. According to Deutsche Bahn, about 80 percent of the affected technology was expected to be operational again by the end of 2021, but in severely affected regions, restoration could take years. As heating oil tanks and pipelines from oil heating systems were damaged and gasoline and diesel leaked from car wrecks, heating oil and fuels entered water bodies. Chemicals from industrial and commercial areas also entered the environment, threatening water quality locally and in downstream regions. In response, Wasserwerke Westfalen shut down one of its plants. Additionally, large amounts of water contaminated with heating oil accumulated in basements and underground garages, posing a significant disposal problem as it needed to be pumped out and cleaned by specialized companies. Destroyed buildings, homes, and vehicles also generated large amounts of scrap, bulky waste, and other debris. By early November, more than 300,000 tons of bulky waste had been registered in the Ahrweiler district alone, equivalent to the waste volume of 40 normal years. In the weeks following the destruction, public health officials identified a risk of epidemics in the affected areas due to the ongoing decomposition of human and animal corpses as well as sewage leaks. Additionally, the destruction of infrastructure, including hospitals and medical practices, severely threatened basic medical care in the affected areas. The population lacked urgently needed medications. Looting occurred in the affected areas after the natural disaster, prompting police to remain deployed in the devastated regions. On August 28, 2021, six weeks after the flood disaster, a memorial service was held at Aachen Cathedral to honor the victims. The ceremony was attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel, the entire federal leadership, and the heads of government of the two particularly affected federal states, Rhineland-Palatinate (Minister-President Malu Dreyer) and North Rhine-Westphalia (Minister-President Armin Laschet), as well as the leaders of the Bundesrat (Reiner Haseloff), Bundestag (Wolfgang Schäuble), and Federal Constitutional Court (Stephan Harbarth). Following the service, Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivered a speech in which he, among other things, called for determination in combating climate change. The memorial service was held at the invitation of the Chairman of the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), Regional Bishop Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, the Chairman of the Catholic German Bishops' Conference, Georg Bätzing, and the Chairman of the Working Group of Christian Churches in Germany, Archpriest Radu Constantin Miron. Representatives of the Jewish and Muslim faiths, as well as other Christian leaders, also participated, while Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich traveled from Luxembourg."

By early September 2021, all the deceased had been clearly identified, but there were still three missing persons, which did not change by the end of the month. Furthermore, it was determined that eight recovered victims had died before the flood, reducing the number of people actually killed by the flood in Rhineland-Palatinate to 133. In October 2021, the death of another person, who had been missing after the flood, was confirmed. This brought the number of people killed by the flood in Rhineland-Palatinate to 134. An initial larger assessment of property damage, conducted ten days after the flood in Rhineland-Palatinate, estimated that at least 17,000 people had directly lost property due to the flood. Of the more than 3,000 damaged buildings, at least 467 were destroyed, including nearly 200 residential houses. Several kilometers of roads were completely destroyed, and over 73.9 kilometers of roads, paths, and bridges along the Ahr were damaged. A carriageway of the under-construction Ahr crossing of Federal Highway 9 near Sinzig had subsided due to an undermined pillar and was therefore demolished. On the Ahr Valley Railway, at least seven railway bridges and around 20 kilometers of track were destroyed by overflows and undercutting. The 1,600 businesses registered with the Chamber of Crafts and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in the Ahr Valley suffered estimated property damage totaling 560 million euros. The Ahrweiler district was particularly hard hit, where the Ahr flood left a trail of destruction. In the local municipality of Schuld, six houses collapsed, and numerous others were severely damaged. In the district, 62 bridges were destroyed, and another 13 were severely damaged; 19 daycare centers and 14 schools also suffered damage. More than 330 people were rescued from rooftops and trees with up to 36 helicopters. Of the 112 bridges in the affected area, only 35 were fully usable as of August 20, 2021—more than a month later. In the city of Sinzig, twelve residents of the \"Lebenshilfe-Haus\" facility for people with disabilities died. The floods came faster than the people could be brought to safety. Weather experts argue, however, that the disaster had been foreseeable long before the actual event. Days before the floods, the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) warned that so-called flash floods could occur in the affected areas. According to the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, model calculations show that the flood was made 1.2 to 9 times more likely by climate change. In the districts of Bitburg-Prüm, Vulkaneifel, and Trier-Saarburg, a state of emergency was declared. The local municipality of Kordel was particularly affected. Here, the Kyll River reached a record water level of 7.85 meters. On the evening of July 14, 2021, the Prüm River in Prüm reached 3.27 meters, the Lieser River in Wittlich reached 3.63 meters, and the Nims River in Alsdorf and Bitburg-Stahl reached record levels of 3.49 meters the following morning. At the Irrel Waterfalls, the covered pedestrian bridge and part of the slope were washed away and destroyed by the flood, as was the camping site in Oberweis. The flood in Rhineland-Palatinate also unearthed about 350 kilograms of unexploded ordnance and a non-detonable bomb from World War II. At the beginning of 2022, the state authority for supervision and services estimated the total damage caused by the flood in Rhineland-Palatinate at 15 billion euros."

On the second weekend after the disaster, the local road network was so overloaded as a result that professional helpers, the military, and garbage trucks could no longer pass. Consequently, the situation center temporarily called on the helpers to leave. Meanwhile, private initiatives emerged that contributed little to the traffic congestion. Two entrepreneurs from the Ahr Valley organized a so-called helper shuttle (shuttle service), through which thousands of volunteers were systematically brought to the affected areas by bus from the Rheinland Grafschaft Innovation Park. Since September 27, 2021, private households have been able to submit funding applications for reconstruction. Applications were accepted until June 30, 2023. Of the special fund \"Reconstruction Aid 2021,\" originally equipped with 30 billion euros from federal funds, about 3.3 billion euros had been used by the end of 2023. In early October 2021, the North Structure and Approval Directorate published revised flood hazard maps for the Ahr. According to these, all houses—except for 34 in so-called \"hazard areas\"—may be (partially) rebuilt under certain conditions. For buildings in designated flood zones that can be renovated, a flood-adapted construction method is only recommended. Prime Minister Malu Dreyer stated that the vast majority of homeowners received \"the certainty that they can renovate on-site.\" The state government (Dreyer III Cabinet) thereby ignores numerous urgent recommendations from scientists. Opposition to stricter restrictions on reconstruction came from mayors in the Ahr Valley, who see wine tourism at risk. This already leads to above-average land sealing in the towns. The civil society alliance Aus Ahrtal wird SolAHRtal, together with representatives from local politics, science, and business, demands reconstruction as a model region for complete supply through renewable energies. The conservation organizations BUND and NABU criticize that side arms and gravel banks created by the Ahr were removed and a trapezoidal riverbed was restored, which is detrimental to both species and flood protection. Anja Käfer-Rohrbach, CEO of the German Insurance Association (GDV), described the near-original reconstruction of the settlement structure in the Ahr Valley in 2024 as a \"disaster on repeat.\""

The Rhine itself was only marginally affected by the flooding due to its comparatively large discharge capacity.  \n\nBy July 16, 25 cities and districts in North Rhine-Westphalia were particularly affected by the flooding. By that day, according to the Interior Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Herbert Reul, 19,000 emergency personnel from aid organizations had handled 30,000 flood-related operations, and the North Rhine-Westphalia police had handled another 3,200 operations. In the Bergisches Land region, the flooding caused days-long power outages and large-scale evacuations (such as in Hückeswagen and Leichlingen). The drastic consequences of the weather disaster in western Germany were also strongly felt in Euskirchen, Rheinbach, Swisttal, Stolberg, Eschweiler, and Erftstadt. Due to the flooding and the endangered Steinbach dam, several thousand residents in several localities had to leave their homes.  \n\nThe overflowing Erft and Swist rivers flooded large parts of the Erftstadt city area, and several localities were partially or completely evacuated. Major roads such as the federal highways 1 (Eifelautobahn) and 61, as well as federal road 265, were closed due to flooding and road damage. In the Erftstadt district of Blessem, the water from the Erft flowed through a residential and commercial area and carved a new path into the gravel pit of the Blessem quarry; several houses near Blessem Castle were undermined and damaged in the process. However, no fatalities were reported in the Rhein-Erft district.  \n\nThe Cologne public prosecutor's office is investigating the owner of the open-pit mine, the operating company from Bergheim, as well as the responsible supervisory authority in Arnsberg, \"on suspicion of negligent causing of a flood by omission, endangering construction, and violation of the Federal Mining Act.\" It is suspected that a flood protection wall was missing in the old area of the pit and that the slopes were excessively steep. According to Westdeutscher Rundfunk, warnings had been ignored since 2011.  \n\nThe St. Antonius Hospital in Eschweiler was completely evacuated on July 15; over 300 patients were transferred to other hospitals. On July 17, the Euskirchen correctional facility was largely evacuated. Looters were arrested in the neighboring cities of Eschweiler and Stolberg. In affected towns such as Bad Münstereifel, there were fatalities, and numerous historic houses were destroyed or damaged.  \n\nAs the Inde river overflowed, the Inden open-pit mine was partially flooded; one person was reported missing as a result and was eventually found dead on July 22 and identified a week later. The town of Inden was also largely flooded. Damage occurred not only to major roads but also to many railway lines: at times, train traffic in the southern half of North Rhine-Westphalia was barely possible. Long-distance trains from the north terminated in Münster, among other places, and several regional train lines were canceled. Particularly affected were the main train stations in Hagen and Wuppertal, as well as the railway lines running through them (including the Hagen–Dieringhausen railway, the Ruhr-Sieg railway, and the Elberfeld–Dortmund railway).  \n\nOn July 14, the Eicherscheid flood retention basin in the Eifel and other retention basins near Horchheim, Weilerswist, and Kerpen-Mödrath were opened to reduce the flow into the Erft. The Rheinische Post reported a dam breach on the Rur river in Wassenberg-Ophoven on July 16, 2021. On July 20, a settlement in Bergisches Leichlingen was evacuated due to a potential dam breach.  \n\nAdditionally, on July 14, a small tornado formed in Castrop-Rauxel, causing several property damages. After all cases were clarified, the search for missing persons was concluded on July 28, 2021. By that time, 47 people had died in North Rhine-Westphalia due to the flood. In August 2021, two more people died in hospitals from injuries sustained.  \n\nStarting September 17, 2021, private households and housing industry companies could apply for reconstruction funding. Applications were accepted until June 30, 2023."

In Bretten-Ruit, the rain, but not the Salzach, caused the flooding of the town. In Inzlingen, a 17-year-old was rescued after being sucked into an open manhole by the floodwaters. In the Radolfzell area on Lake Constance, several towns experienced a power outage lasting several hours on the following Friday morning due to a landslide. A person in the Heilbronn district was found dead after falling into the Jagst River. Additionally, on the evening of July 16, 2021, the Danube railway between Ehingen and Munderkingen was suspended after the tracks were undermined and flooded. At the same time, the Götzenbach in Lorch in the Ostalb district flooded several houses. On the morning of July 17, 2021, the water level at the Maxau gauge of the Upper Rhine in Karlsruhe had already risen to 8.62 meters, which also led to the flooding of retention areas in Kehl and Altenheim in the Ortenau district. Part of the route during the reactivation celebration of the Biberbahn between Stockach and Mengen was also closed on the same day because the railway embankment was damaged."

From July 14, drinking water in parts of the districts of Ansbach, Roth, and Weißenburg-Gunzenhausen was contaminated with fecal bacteria after heavy rainfall and was therefore boiled. Reichenberg near Würzburg was even flooded twice within seven days, on July 9 and July 15. In Ansbach, the Rezat rose to a level of 4.29 meters. Additionally, this disaster coincided with the discovery of a bomb at Ansbach station, which further challenged emergency services. After the low-pressure system Bernd moved south, places in the Berchtesgadener Land region were flooded on the evening of July 17 following heavy rainfall, prompting the district to declare a state of emergency. The Berchtesgadener Ache rose to 3.50 meters, surpassing the previous high of 3.12 meters in 2012. As a landslide was feared in Schönau am Königssee, evacuations took place there and in other locations.

In Bar-le-Duc, the Ornain River and the Canal de la Marne au Rhin overflowed. In the Upper Rhine, the Erstein polder, a flood retention basin south of Strasbourg, was flooded to reduce the significantly increased flow of the Rhine following intense rainfall in Switzerland. Heavy rainfall occurred over the Jura and Doubs departments as well as in southern Alsace. In the Jura department, part of the locality of Bletterans was flooded. Additionally, due to the flooding of the Orain, a tributary of the Doubs, the locality of Chaussain had to be evacuated, as well as the campsite near Parcey due to the flooding of the Loue. Departmental road 332 was disrupted. In Montmorot, there were only minor floods because the flood retention basins were able to significantly mitigate the flood. In Besançon, the Doubs overflowed its banks. On July 17, 2021, the Seille in the Saône-et-Loire department overflowed its banks and flooded the town center of Louhans-Châteaurenaud.

Frequent precipitation in May and June 2021 had caused many soils to become saturated when the severe storm occurred, leaving them unable to absorb much more water. In the high Alps, snowmelt was still ongoing until mid-July, which had already caused some rivers to have elevated water levels. After heavy, prolonged rainfall in the Alps, the Jura, and the Swiss Plateau, numerous streams, rivers, and lakes overflowed their banks in several cantons starting on July 11, 2021, and landslides and debris flows occurred in some areas. Various towns were flooded, and some transportation routes were disrupted. On July 14, authorities declared the highest danger level for several bodies of water, especially the large pre-Alpine lakes. Strong storm gusts caused significant property damage, including in the city of Zurich, and disruptions to the transportation network from July 12 to 13. Flooding and local inundations particularly affected the river systems of the Aare, Reuss, Limmat, and Rhone, as well as the Ticino south of the main Alpine ridge. A significant amount of water flowed from the Swiss Jura into France via the Doubs and into the Rhone via the Saône. The Reuss overflowed its banks in the cantons of Uri and Aargau on July 13. In Brugg and Gebenstorf, where the Reuss and Limmat flow into the Aare, the Schachenland and Stroppelinsel areas were underwater. On July 16, 2021, the Aare also flooded in Bern. In some municipalities, riverside roads and bridges were closed. The canton of Uri preemptively closed the A2 motorway near Altdorf, which runs alongside the Reuss. In Hünenberg, the Reuss dam was monitored due to the risk of rupture. Transportation routes to Engelberg were interrupted due to debris flows. A landslide disrupted the Wengernalp Railway route between Lauterbrunnen and Wengen in the Bernese Oberland on July 18. In the canton of Ticino, the main road between Bellinzona and Airolo was closed on July 14 due to a rockfall triggered by the storm. In Lucerne, Thun, Bern, Bremgarten, Mellingen, Windisch, Wallbach, and other towns along the Reuss, Aare, and Rhine, municipalities deployed mobile flood protection elements and barriers, which had been prepared as a precaution since the last major flood events. This prevented widespread flooding in some areas. However, damage occurred in many places due to rising groundwater. In Brunnen, Stansstad, and Küssnacht, parts of town centers were flooded. The water level of Lake Lucerne reached its peak of 434.94 meters above sea level on the night of July 16 to 17, 2021, and began to slightly recede in the following days. At the Badbrücke in Wolhusen, two cars were swept into the Kleine Emme on July 25, 2021. The outflow of water from the Alps and the Swiss Plateau caused the Rhine's water flow to increase significantly below the Aare's confluence near Koblenz AG. The Birs, flowing out of the Jura, flooded areas near Basel and further intensified the Rhine flooding. Due to the Rhine flooding, the city of Basel had to close its riverfront promenades, and Rhine shipping below Birsfelden and on the Upper Rhine was suspended on July 13. This led to delivery failures at Basel's Rhine ports and delays in freight transport. Shipping was also halted on Lake Lucerne, Lake Thun, and Lake Biel. Lake Biel rose above the damage threshold after several days due to inflows from the Aare, Zihl, and Schüss, as well as the Jura water regulation at the Port regulating weir, and overflowed its banks at Nidau and Biel/Bienne. The lake reached an unprecedented high level. Consequently, water from Lake Biel began to flow backward into Lake Neuchâtel through the Zihl Canal in the west, as planned under the second Jura water correction concept, even though Lake Neuchâtel had not yet experienced flooding. With the inflow from Lake Biel, the water level in Lake Neuchâtel also rose, eventually flooding the lakeshore area in Yverdon-les-Bains, including various sports facilities and a campsite. The water level in Lake Biel also reached its highest point of 430.94 meters above sea level on the night of July 16 to 17 and quickly dropped by about 30 centimeters the following day due to outflows through the Nidau-Büren Canal and the Zihl Canal. When Lake Biel and Lake Neuchâtel reached the same water level, the flooding remained stable for an extended period, and the inundated lakeshore areas remained underwater. Lake Neuchâtel reached its record-high water level of 430.72 meters above sea level on July 19, 2021, nearly a week after the heavy rain began in Switzerland. From Lake Neuchâtel, the floodwaters continued to flow into Lake Murten, where several sections of the lakeshore and the Salavaux campsite were flooded. As of July 19, the highest warning level and a ban on water sports were still in effect for Lake Biel. By July 24, the lake level had dropped to 430.34 meters above sea level thanks to the outflow into the Aare, remaining within the upper range of danger level 3. Many building basements around the lake were still underwater due to the significantly elevated groundwater level and could not yet be pumped out by the fire department. The lake police and the Office for Water and Waste removed large amounts of driftwood from the lake. To reduce the lake flooding, the Port regulating weir continued to allow a higher outflow into the Aare under a special agreement between the affected cantons and the federal government, exceeding the limits set by the inter-cantonal regulation. It was not until July 29, 2021, that the water level at Ligerz on Lake Biel, and on August 2 for Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Murten, dropped below danger level 2. In the Schaffhausen municipalities of Schleitheim and Beggingen in the Randental valley, the Schleitheimer Bach, which flows through both towns, overflowed its banks on July 15 due to heavy rain, causing significant damage. In the Rhone catchment area, the first severe storm damage occurred in Upper Valais. Debris flows affected the village of Oberwald in Goms, burying roads and part of the settlement. The Matterhorn-Gotthard Railway route and the pass roads over the Grimsel, Furka, and Nufenen passes were temporarily closed. In Lower Valais, local flooding occurred due to the Rhone flooding. The cantonal road between Lausanne and Vevey on Lake Geneva was interrupted by a landslide. Lake Geneva experienced flooding, which was exacerbated when the outflow at the Seujet dam was temporarily reduced to protect downstream areas from flooding. Below the Rhone's outflow from the lake in Geneva, the floods of the Rhone and its tributary, the Arve from Savoy, caused flooding in the Jonction district of the city."

THW units from all eight THW regional associations were mobilized. A week and a half after the disaster, about 4,000 THW personnel from across Germany were deployed in the flood-affected areas. In total, more than 14,000 emergency personnel with over 2,000,000 hours of operation were involved. Units of disaster relief from Bavaria, Hesse, Lower Saxony, and Hamburg were also deployed in the flood areas. On July 14, 2021, the first requests for administrative assistance were received by the Bundeswehr's Territorial Tasks Command. Up to 900 soldiers were deployed in Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia. The units also provided support with recovery tanks, transport tanks, bridge-laying tanks, trucks, boats, ambulances, and helicopters. Many farmers, contractors, and thousands of volunteers from all federal states helped with tractors, excavators, wheel loaders, and other equipment in the affected areas. They worked complementarily and independently of the rescue forces, removing debris from the areas. Even months after the flood, hundreds of people (thousands on some weekends) traveled daily to the affected areas to help. Various emergency responders from the so-called \"Blue Light Family\" were subsequently awarded the 2021 Flood Relief Medal."

Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), who was on a state visit to Washington, D.C. at the time, thanked the many helpers for their efforts and expressed her sympathy to the relatives of the deceased and missing. After her return from the United States, she visited the Ahr Valley and the local community of Schuld accompanied by Malu Dreyer. There, she stated that the federal government would investigate the course of the flood disaster and provide financial aid for the affected regions; furthermore, politics must take greater account of nature and climate in the future. Bavaria's Minister President Markus Söder (CSU) also promised aid for the affected states. The Deputy Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate, Anne Spiegel (Greens), traveled to the flood events in Trier and Kordel. The example of Trier-Ehrang, Spiegel said, showed that the flood protection measures of the state and municipalities were insufficient. Chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock (Greens) traveled to the affected areas on July 16. However, she refrained from being accompanied by press representatives to avoid the impression that she was campaigning. The situation there was too serious for that, party circles said. The so-called \"Laschet laugh\" on July 17, 2021, during the speech of Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in the flood area in North Rhine-Westphalia significantly influenced the campaign for the 2021 federal election. Subsequently, the CDU/CSU's poll numbers plummeted. The AfD's climate policy spokesperson, Karsten Hilse, described the heavy rainfall that led to the floods as a \"natural phenomenon.\" Human-made emissions played no role in it. There had always been \"devastating disasters\" in historical times, and he condemned other parties for exploiting people's suffering to pursue their own political goals. The German Association of Towns and Municipalities called for quick aid from the federal and state governments on July 16, 2021. Shortened planning procedures for climate and disaster protection projects were also necessary. The German Federation for the Environment and Nature Conservation (BUND) called for a consistent expansion of ecological flood protection in light of the disaster to prevent such magnitudes in the future. Floodplains must be consistently designated for this purpose and must not be built on, used for agriculture, or sealed by road construction. Intact river meadows should be protected from human intervention to function as natural retention areas in the event of flooding. For effective protection, extensive renaturation would be necessary, including both flowing waters and moors. For these measures, BUND suggested that the federal government should immediately provide funds for ecologically sustainable renaturation measures through the state governments. Ecological flood protection should not be limited to large rivers but should also include smaller watercourses to significantly reduce flood damage in the future. Various associations and organizations called for donations for those affected. Aktion Deutschland Hilft, the alliance of all major German aid organizations, launched a donation campaign for the flood victims. According to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA), some tourists canceled bookings in unaffected parts of the country because, for example, the entire Rhineland-Palatinate was considered a disaster area. However, some businesses in the affected areas, such as in the Moselle Valley, had already reopened. DEHOGA President Gereon Haumann, however, assumed that in the severely affected district of Ahrweiler, almost no guests could be served or accommodated within the next twelve months. To address the damage caused by the July floods, particularly in Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia, a special fund \"Reconstruction Aid 2021\" was established with the Reconstruction Aid Fund Establishment Act 2021 of September 10, 2021 (BGBl. I p. 4147). In addition, the obligation to file for insolvency in the affected areas was suspended by the Act on the Temporary Suspension of the Obligation to File for Insolvency Due to Heavy Rainfall and Floods in July 2021 (BGBl. I p. 4147, 4149). The reconstruction fund is established as a special fund of the federal government and is equipped with up to 30 billion euros by the federal government. The states will then share in the repayment by transferring shares of VAT revenue to the federal government until 2050. The money is intended to benefit affected private households, businesses, and other institutions, as well as to restore infrastructure. The reconstruction of federal infrastructure, such as federal highways, will be separately financed by the federal government."

The quality of weather forecasts has improved significantly over the past decades; thirty European countries collaborate on this within the organization EUMETSAT. In Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, there is a comprehensive network of precipitation radar stations. International experts criticized the high death toll despite the warnings. The emergency plans of some municipalities proved inadequate in the face of the severity of floods and flash floods; some were caught unprepared. EFAS issued an \"extreme flood warning\" at the beginning of calendar week 28. Four days before the most devastating floods, the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and Belgium officially warned of flooding on the Rhine and Meuse. On July 14, 2021, precise forecasts and maps were sent to German authorities, indicating which districts would be affected by flooding. These included areas along the Ahr, where 133 people died due to the flooding. The German Weather Service (DWD) stated that it had forwarded the warnings to the responsible local authorities, which are in charge of any evacuations. In some municipalities, sirens were activated as a result; however, most districts no longer have sirens. In the Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis, sirens were reportedly deliberately not activated due to concerns that the emergency number 112 would be overwhelmed with inquiries. Additionally, in Germany, DWD and BBK issued their own notifications—particularly as push messages via warning apps like NINA—including warnings of the highest danger category for the Eifel and Moselle regions. However, these notifications only reached smartphone owners who had actively installed a warning app. IT experts criticized that in Germany, the sending of text messages to all mobile phones registered in a cell (Cell Broadcast) has not yet been used to warn the population in disaster situations, even though Directive (EU) 2018/1972 (EECC Directive) has recommended the use of such \"digital sirens\" since 2018. Many other European countries use Cell Broadcast. In response, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building, and Community (BMI) commissioned the introduction of Cell Broadcast in July 2021."

                "content": "Experts criticized major gaps in disaster protection and inadequate civil protection in Germany. Hydrologist Hannah Cloke from the British University of Reading made serious accusations against disaster management in Germany. The warning from the European Flood Awareness System had been in the \"extreme category,\" which meant a danger to life. It was therefore the responsibility of the national authority to respond accordingly. With such clear information, authorities would normally prepare for evacuation. \"That's how disaster risk management works,\" she told the Belgian weekly newspaper Politico. Cloke sees failures in Germany on several levels: there is a lack of a nationwide uniform approach to flood risks, and different flood plans are needed for various scenarios. Cloke told Politico: \"I would have expected people to be evacuated – and not for so many people to die in a flood in 2021.\" Criticism was raised that evacuations in Germany, if at all, were carried out very late. In contrast, authorities in Belgian Liège and several at-risk locations in Luxembourg implemented precautionary evacuations. In the Ahrweiler district, District Administrator Jürgen Pföhler (CDU) was criticized for declaring the flood disaster and ordering partial evacuations far too late. The district had been repeatedly and precisely warned of the flood disaster by the responsible State Office for the Environment in Rhineland-Palatinate. For instance, the State Office for the Environment reported an expected water level of almost seven meters on July 14 at around 9:30 p.m. When Pföhler declared the disaster situation at around 11:15 p.m., houses were already being swept away by the floodwaters. In the Ahrweiler district, there were more than 130 fatalities in the flood disaster. Uwe Kirsche from the German Weather Service (DWD) told the New York Times that the warnings had reached local authorities, but the question was why they had not evacuated earlier. The cross-border flood portal (a service providing information to the public about flood situations in Germany and Switzerland) warned both online and via app about rising water levels. However, there was at least one case where the water levels predicted by the portal, which were significantly higher than the so-called 2016 centennial flood, were beyond the imagination of a responsible mayor, who believed no evacuation was necessary. This was also due to the fact that in his local community of Mayschoß, after the 2016 flood, a report on heavy rainfall and flood protection had been prepared, which assumed lower peak water levels, and the community had based its protective measures on this. The mayor of the heavily affected Trier-Land municipality, Michael Holstein (Free Voters), criticized the inadequate equipment of disaster management. The flood disaster had shown that emergency services were underfunded, he told Südwestrundfunk. In Kordel, emergency forces were only able to reach the site in sufficient numbers with the help of the Bundeswehr. Heavy equipment to clear the numerous landslides was not available in the region and only arrived in Kordel after a two-hour drive from northern Rhineland-Palatinate. Since more flood disasters are to be expected in the future, he called for more personnel and equipment for local civil protection. The evaluation of daily situation reports during the week of the flood disaster shows that the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance was \"apparently surprised\" by the extent of the flood disaster. Westdeutscher Rundfunk applied to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building, and Community (BMI) for access to the documents under the Freedom of Information Act."

At the same time, WDR admitted that the reporting had not been sufficient. RTL reporter Susanna Ohlen faced criticism because she smeared her face with mud before a live report in Bad Münstereifel.

In March 2022, text messages exchanged between Anne Spiegel, then Rhineland-Palatinate's Minister of the Environment, and her press spokesman were made public and submitted to the state parliament's 18/1 committee of inquiry on the flood disaster in Rhineland-Palatinate. They suggest that the state government did not respond in time to the flood and that the then Minister of the Environment, Spiegel, was primarily concerned with her image the morning after the flood wave. According to research by the Kölner Stadtanzeiger, it became known that the then North Rhine-Westphalian Minister of the Environment, Ursula Heinen-Esser, had mostly worked from her home office in Mallorca during the flood disaster instead of being on-site in the affected areas. Additionally, she reportedly celebrated a party there with other cabinet members, including Municipal Minister Ina Scharrenbach, for her husband's birthday. After initially rejecting calls for personal consequences following the incident, known as the \"Mallorca Affair,\" Heinen-Esser resigned from her ministerial office on April 7, 2022, a few weeks before the state election on May 15. On October 12, 2022, Roger Lewentz announced his resignation as Rhineland-Palatinate's Minister of the Interior. The reason for his resignation was ongoing criticism related to his role during the flood disaster. Lewentz preempted a planned debate on the same topic in the state parliament plenary, which had been scheduled at the request of the opposition factions of the CDU and Free Voters. He also faced criticism due to recently revealed police videos from the night of the disaster, showing people in extreme distress. The Ministry of the Interior stated that a situation report on the situation in the Ahr Valley was sent to the situation center by email at 12:53 a.m. on July 15. However, Lewentz himself did not have the report that night. Since October 2021, a Rhineland-Palatinate committee of inquiry has been investigating the events surrounding the disaster."

The dismantling of numerous sirens and other civil protection facilities after the end of the Cold War proved disadvantageous for comprehensive alerting of the population to dangers. Therefore, municipalities and districts are granted support of up to 10,850 euros per new siren built on a building or per upgrade of an existing siren on a building, and even more for sirens mounted on specially constructed masts. By April 2022, the federal government had already invested 88 million euros in replacing dismantled sirens from recent decades or modernizing still existing ones. However, this campaign only supports electronic sirens, not motor sirens. According to a report by WDR, the Cologne district government has designated a new area for the Erft where flooding is to be expected. This is based on observations from the flood event and computer simulations. It has been significantly expanded compared to the previous area, which proved necessary as the actual flow of the Erft at the Bliesheim gauge was approximately 520 m³/s, about five times the previously assumed worst-case scenario of 100 m³/s."

One documented method was disinformation about state aid measures combined with their own aid offers for flood victims. Through social media, attempts were made to sow doubt about health preventive measures, aid offers from state authorities, and aid organizations. Conspiracy theorist Bodo Schiffmann and other individuals from the \"Querdenker\" scene called for donations to their own bank accounts. It is unclear to what extent the money collected by Schiffmann was actually paid out to flood victims. Schiffmann allegedly collected 600,000 euros but then devised conditions for disbursement, such as ending the alleged discrimination against opponents of masks and vaccinations. He also stated that he would only pay funds to construction companies that advertised for a \"Querdenker\" demonstration in Berlin or cooperated with the \"Querdenker\" in other ways. Donations collected by him were rejected by both the mayors and the first responders in the public eye. Reiner Fuellmich (Bundestag candidate for dieBasis), Attila Hildmann, and Michael Wendler considered or claimed that a weather weapon (including the HAARP conspiracy theory) or geoengineering had been used to deliberately create an emergency and gain political profit from it. Nikolai Nerling broadcast videos from the affected Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler and stated that it was \"great\" that emergency services like THW and the fire department had not yet been able to reach all affected areas, as this would \"finally lead to self-responsibility\" and show that the \"BRD organizations\" were not needed at all. Together with a retired colonel under observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and other activists, Nerling set up a relief center in Ahrweiler, used police-like vehicles, and called on reservists via the internet with an official-looking deployment order to come to the affected areas. Due to suspicion of impersonation of authority, the Koblenz police initiated proceedings against the colonel and warned against vehicles with loudspeakers resembling police vehicles. The police-like vehicles, also used at several \"Querdenker\" demonstrations, spread false information via loudspeakers that police and rescue forces were withdrawing from the flood regions. The flood crisis team in Rhineland-Palatinate also warned against Nerling's donation appeal. In the Ahrweiler district, the association \"Eltern stehen auf\" set up a so-called \"family center\" to relieve victims of the flood disaster. The association opposes protective masks, corona tests in schools, and vaccinations. The activists claimed that 50 therapists and counselors were supposed to take care of the children. The Rhineland-Palatinate State Youth Office closed the facility. The Ahrweiler district also tried to stop the activities and pointed out that the association's claim that it had been officially commissioned to care for the youth was false. According to the vice president of the THW, Sabine Lackner, emergency workers were partially insulted, and vehicles were pelted with garbage. The vice president further stated that the incidents had not been reported. Since many helpers were filmed by \"Querdenker,\" the THW allowed its helpers to remove their name tags during operations."

This value has never been reached before and is also the highest compared to other federal states. As a consequence of the damages, the GDV is calling for a construction ban in areas at risk of flooding. According to the association, a mandatory natural hazard insurance does not provide an incentive for private individuals or municipalities to focus on specific flood protection for buildings and climate protection. This view was supported by environmental protection organizations. According to Munich Re in January 2022, the flood in Germany, with a total damage of approximately 46 billion euros, was the second most expensive natural disaster ever. Munich Re also sees a connection with climate change and calls for better protective measures."

In the Guaratiba neighborhood, located in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, 256 mm of rain was recorded in the 24 hours between March 31 and April 1, the highest level since 2019. The heavy rains put the city on alert, which is the fourth level on a five-level scale. There were several floods throughout the city, including in historically susceptible areas such as Praça da Bandeira, Avenida Maracanã in the North Zone; the neighborhoods of Catete and Laranjeiras in the South Zone, and the Rio das Pedras region in the West Zone. The floods were also exacerbated by the excess of garbage on the streets and sidewalks. Comlurb employees had gone on strike days before the storm. Due to the event, the strike was temporarily suspended so that the capital could be cleaned again, but as soon as the rains stopped, they resumed the strike. In the Costa Verde region, the heaviest rains occurred during the night of April 1 and the early hours of April 2, causing floods and several landslides. In 48 hours, between March 31 and April 2, Paraty recorded 300 mm of rain. The city was isolated due to landslides on the Rio-Santos Highway and RJ-155, the only access routes to the municipality, but they were partially or fully cleared after the arrival of Brazilian Army officials. Meanwhile, the city of Angra dos Reis recorded 655 mm on the mainland and 592 mm on Ilha Grande, the highest levels ever recorded in history. The cities are collecting donations for the areas affected by the storm, and the Federal Government announced a minimum contribution of R$ 2.7 million to the two locations. In Baixada Fluminense, there was also a high rainfall index, with records above 200 mm in the city of Belford Roxo and 156 mm in Nova Iguaçu. The high volume of rain caused many floods in the cities."

This also caused flooding in the Doubs and the Saône. The floodplain downstream of Chalon-sur-Saône was submerged. At the beginning of November, new downpours in the upper reaches of the Saône caused the tributaries Azergues and Turdines to overflow. Between Chalon-sur-Saône and the mouth of the Saône in Lyon, the river reached record heights. On the night of November 1 to 2, the Saône overflowed in Mâcon. Half of the city was submerged, and the gas lighting failed, plunging the entire city into darkness. Twenty kilometers further south, Thoissey, at the confluence of the Chalaronne and the Saône, flooded, and 125 houses were lost. Lyon was severely affected. As early as October 30, the Rhône there nearly reached the level of the 1812 flood. On October 31, at 2 a.m., the earthen dike on the Rhône, built in 1837, broke. The water flooded the 6th arrondissement of Lyon and caused several houses to collapse. The water reached a level 35 cm higher than during the previous major flood of 1812. On the night of November 3 to 4, the Saône also overflowed near Lyon, submerging the lower streets by one to one and a half meters. Several bridges on the Saône were damaged or destroyed by the water. It was not until November 5 that the water level in Lyon began to recede. Downstream of Lyon, there were floods along both banks of the Rhône. In Givors, the Rhône and the Giers overflowed, submerging the lower parts of the city by up to a meter. Thirty houses collapsed, the canal banks were damaged, and factories were rendered inoperative. In Vienne, the Gère overflowed. Tain, Valence, and Avignon also experienced flooding. In the latter city, the flooding began on October 29, after the Rhône had been at a low level two days earlier following a long period of drought. The water level continued to rise, reaching a record height on November 2, higher than that of the 1755 flood. Downstream, the agricultural area around the confluence of the Durance and the Rhône was completely submerged. Tarascon and Beaucaire were entirely underwater."

For the Rhône, upstream of Lyon, the floods of 1927, 1944, or 1990 (depending on the location) are notable. Downstream of Lyon, it is the flood of 1856."

In the department of Saône-et-Loire, 400 houses were destroyed, and in Ain nearly 1,000. Several people lost their lives. When the water finally receded downstream from Avignon on November 20, it left behind a barren layer of sand and stones one meter thick."

The event originated from an Atlantic disturbance which, as part of a severe wave of bad weather over Italy (also affecting the neighboring regions of Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia), brought the region extremely strong winds and persistent rains. The event is erroneously referred to as a \"storm\" (grade 10 on the Beaufort scale), but the winds reached \"hurricane\" speeds (grade 12), winds that commonly originate only over tropical or subtropical waters of the planet. The extremely strong warm sirocco wind, blowing between 100 and 200 km/h for several hours, caused the fall of millions of trees, resulting in the destruction of tens of thousands of hectares of alpine conifer forests, thus constituting a true natural disaster: the Crisis Unit activated by the Veneto Region classified the event as worse than the Venice flood of November 4, 1966 (which nonetheless affected the entire region), the Veneto flood of 2010, and other previous meteorological events recorded in the area."

For several stations in the Belluno area, the amount of rain that fell during the event set an absolute record since the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection began rainfall monitoring in the territory (since 1992). The flood affected some municipalities in Veneto, Trentino, and Friuli, as well as Lombardy. The most affected areas were Agordino, Cadore, Feltrino, Comelico, Carnia, Val di Fassa, and Val di Fiemme. The heavy and abundant rains caused the Piave and Brenta rivers to overflow, while to prevent the Adige River from overflowing, the Adige-Garda tunnel was opened.

In Trentino, at Passo Rolle, the wind reached 217.3 km/h. The extremely strong gusts, comparable according to mountaineer Reinhold Messner to winds recorded on Mount Everest (with very intense average winds often exceeding the highest values of the Beaufort scale, between \"violent storm\" and \"hurricane\"), caused the destruction of numerous trees and, in several cases, the felling of entire forests. The areas most affected by the wind were the Altopiano dei Sette Comuni (especially Val d'Assa and Piana di Marcesina), Val Visdende, Agordino (Alleghe, Canale d'Agordo with Valle di Gares, Colle Santa Lucia, Falcade with Valle del Biois, Rocca Pietore, and the entire Valle di San Lucano in Taibon Agordino), the area surrounding Lake Carezza, the Valli di Fassa and Fiemme (particularly Paneveggio), and the Altopiano di Piné, as well as various areas of the Lagorai mountain range. Part of the Lombardy region (especially Valcamonica) was also affected by the events, with the most impacted areas being Passo Crocedomini in the municipality of Bienno and the municipalities of Paspardo and Cimbergo, as well as several areas in the municipalities of Sonico and Ponte di Legno. In particular, due to the uprooting of numerous trees along power lines and the collapse of pylons, there were significant disruptions to the electricity distribution across the mountainous areas of Triveneto. By October 30, Terna, Enel, and SET Distribuzione had managed with difficulty to restore power to 200,000 users in Veneto and Friuli, but by October 31, there were still 10,000 users without electricity in Carnia, 3,000 in eastern Trentino (Val di Fiemme and Val di Fassa), and 8,600 in the Vicenza area (particularly on the Altopiano dei Sette Comuni)."

The daily rainfall totals often exceeded the monthly average for July. This caused significant damage to hydrotechnical infrastructure (so-called flash floods). Gdańsk is located at the junction of several geographical mesoregions. The western part of the city (the so-called Upper Terrace) is situated on the hilly Kashubian Lake District, while the rest of the city (the so-called Lower Terrace) lies on the lowlands – the Kashubian Coastal Plain and the Vistula Delta, where there are areas below sea level. The highest point in Gdańsk is 180 meters above sea level, and the lowest is 1.6 meters below sea level, with a significant part of the city in the Vistula Delta located at around 0 meters above sea level. On Monday, July 9, 2001, around 3:00 PM, torrential rains began in Gdańsk. Within two hours, 90 mm of rain per square meter (90 liters) fell, while the average monthly rainfall for July in Gdańsk was 75 mm/m². A total of 128 liters of rain per square meter fell that day. The rainfall caused the Strzyża stream and the Radunia Canal to overflow due to failures in hydrotechnical infrastructure – breaches in the embankments in several places. The destruction was compounded by water flowing down the streets from the hilly parts of the city. One of the indirect causes of the flood is often cited as the intensive development of construction on the Upper Terrace of the city, which has been ongoing since the 1980s, and the resulting reduction in local rainwater retention. City authorities disagree with this claim, pointing primarily to the extreme nature of the weather events."

The canal runs along the border of the Kaszubian Lake District and the Vistula Delta mesoregions. It collects water originating from the western, higher parts of the city (e.g., the Oruński Stream). On the eastern, lowland side, the canal is surrounded by a wide flood embankment. The maximum capacity of the Radunia Canal was then estimated at 25 m³/sec. As a result of torrential rain, and consequently the excessive inflow of water into the canal from the upper part of the city, the water flow in the Radunia Canal was five times greater than its capacity, reaching 125 m³/sec. This resulted in the breach of the flood embankment in five places. Additionally, the upper pond in Oruński Park, located above the Radunia Canal, overflowed, breaking its dam. South of Święty Wojciech, near the border with Pruszcz Gdański, the canal embankment was deliberately breached to divert water into the Radunia River, which flows parallel at that point. Most of the district on the eastern side of the Radunia Canal was submerged (for comparison, the district had 16,000 residents in 2010). In some places, the water reached as high as the first floor. The agricultural part of the district – Niegowo – was also flooded."

The Warsaw-Gdańsk railway line was undermined, resulting in the suspension of train traffic for several days. Material losses (excluding private property) were estimated at 200 million PLN. 2,000 people were evacuated, 1,200 residential units required renovation, and 600 needed reconstruction. Many historic buildings were demolished. Due to the damage, 134 buildings were dismantled. Between 2001 and 2005, 41 million PLN was spent on addressing the housing-related consequences of the flood. The events initiated a series of investments in flood protection infrastructure in Gdańsk. Dozens of retention reservoirs were built on watercourses flowing from the city's Upper Terrace, along with several stormwater pumping stations. The restoration of Orunia Park from the flood damage lasted until 2009. Within a decade of the flood, the city of Gdańsk spent 150 million PLN on flood protection measures. Between 2011 and 2014, the Radunia Canal was revitalized at a cost of 133 million PLN. As part of this investment, a Larsen wall was installed inside the flood embankment."

This breach widened to about 50 meters. This initial breach was followed by two smaller ones, a few hours later, on the other side of the Carmona road. The first waters quickly reached the neighborhoods of La Corza, El Fontanal, Árbol Gordo, San José Obrero, Miraflores, and the entire northern part of the city from the Ronda de Capuchinos. Independently of this point, that same day, two other critical points emerged further south in the city. The first was caused by the overflow of the same Tamarguillo in an area near the Su Eminencia road, whose waters reached Cerro del Águila, Prado de San Sebastián, and María Luisa Park. The second occurred as a result of the overflow of the Guadaira River, with its waters merging with those of the Tamarguillo in María Luisa Park and reaching the Puerta de Jerez. During the night, an old Guadalquivir riverbed that ran from the Alameda de Hércules and La Campana to Plaza Nueva was flooded, with a maximum water level of three meters in the Alameda. On the morning of November 26, the flooding of the city reached its maximum extent. On Monday, the 27th, water levels began to slightly decrease, and by Tuesday, the improvement was noticeable, revealing the damage caused by the water. That afternoon, the main breach in the Tamarguillo was sealed. No official end date for the Tamarguillo flood was given, but as of November 30, water still remained in some neighborhoods. It has been estimated that the approximate volume of water that flooded the capital was 4,000,000 m³, reaching a height of three to four meters in the most affected areas. According to official figures, the flooded area was 552 hectares, one-third of the total city, and affected 150,000 residents to varying degrees. More recent investigations have increased the number of affected hectares to 3,448, a surface area about six times larger than the official data."

The funding was covered by national subsidies, the prefecture's recovery and reconstruction project budget, and donations collected from across the country. River improvement by the national government had begun in 1937, the year before the flood, but it was fully implemented after the disaster. The river improvement included straightening the meandering Kimotsuki River and constructing embankments. According to the Osumi River and National Highway Office, it is believed that flooding would not occur even if rainfall of the same scale were to happen again. However, during Typhoon No. 24 in 2018, tributaries temporarily exceeded the flood danger level, indicating that situations beyond expectations are possible."
