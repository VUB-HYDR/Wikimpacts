                "content": "The eyewitness Emo of Wittewierum, the later abbot of the Premonstratensian monastery of Wittewierum near Groningen, noted in the Chronicon abbatum in Werum that on January 16, 1219, \"in the 55th year after the Julian flood,\" the \"bloodthirsty southwest wind,\" which had been bringing hail for days, turned into a storm, shifted to the northwest during the night at full moon, and caused great floods that breached the dikes and washed away the houses. Although Abbot Emo attempted a natural philosophical explanation, he ultimately interpreted the Marcellus flood and the subsequent famine as a deluge \"because of our crimes.\" The wealthy marsh farmers had not thought of the poor; therefore, they lost their land. According to an unreliable report in the Saxon World Chronicle, this severe storm surge, incorrectly dated to November 17, 1218, claimed about 36,000 lives along the North Sea coast. The Colmar Annals even mention a figure of 50,000 victims. West Friesland in present-day Netherlands was particularly hard hit. There, the North Sea broke through a naturally formed sand wall, creating the marine bay Zuiderzee (southern sea), which is now artificially separated from the North Sea by the IJsselmeer. Some chronicles from the 16th century attributed this storm surge to the formation of the Jade Bay. Accordingly, the water is said to have broken in at the former village mound of Alt-Gödens after it had destroyed the legendary sluice with copper doors. The parishes that were allegedly flooded at that time (Oldessen, Dauerns, Hummens, Jadele, Dangast, Arngast, and Alt-Gödens or Lee) still existed in the 1420s. Only Hiddels had already disappeared. Therefore, the expansion of the Jade Bay can only be placed in the course of the 15th century, significantly later than the storm flood legend suggests."

Rivers flooded especially in South Ostrobothnia and North Satakunta. According to meteorologist Matti Huutonen, during the day (October 5-6), some areas received as much rain as normally falls in a month. Also outside the flood area, for example in Kokemäki and Pori, over 30 millimeters of daily rainfall was recorded. In Ilmajoki, highway 67 had to be closed due to water flooding onto the road. Roads were also closed elsewhere in South Ostrobothnia. In Kankaanpää, water also rose onto the roads. In Ilmajoki, Kauhajoki, and Lapväärt, several houses were surrounded by water and basements were flooded. Residents in Kauhajoki had to be moved to temporary accommodations. MTV3 reported on October 8 that the flood situation was beginning to ease, but it added that it would take at least another week before normal water level readings could be reached. In contrast, the flood situation in Satakunta continued to be severe, as Yle reported on October 15 that more rain, about 20 millimeters, was expected there. According to Bertel Vehviläinen, the leading hydrologist at the Finnish Environment Institute, the flood of the Kyrönjoki River is the largest ever recorded in Finland. Many other rivers in South Ostrobothnia also reached record heights."

The precipitation was caused by the Vb low \"Ilse.\" A wedge of the high pressure \"Friedmann\" over Scandinavia caused the low to be pushed southward from its usual west-east path towards the Mediterranean. Here, these air masses warmed significantly due to seasonal conditions and absorbed a lot of moisture. After crossing the Alps towards the north, they encountered the cold air there, cooled down sharply, and extreme precipitation occurred in a relatively short time. The rainfall initially concentrated along the path of the low in Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, and the Czech Republic, and subsequently intensified in eastern Germany. Here, the low-pressure area rotated and completely rained itself out by the end of its life cycle. The rainfall was additionally intensified by orographically induced lifting processes in the Alps, but especially along the middle mountain ranges (Ore and Giant Mountains). A similar weather situation was also the cause of the Oder flood in 1997."

                "content": "A first heavy rainfall event occurred on August 6/7, with focal points in Chiemgau and Berchtesgadener Land. Within 48 hours, more than 100 mm of precipitation fell widely, which corresponded to about two-thirds of the average monthly mean (1961–1990) for August. The largest daily rainfall of 117 mm was recorded on August 6 in Ruhpolding; at Wendelstein, 62 mm of rain fell in just 6 hours. This event led to soil saturation and set the stage for the actual, even higher flood event caused by rainfall from August 10 to 12. On the evening of August 10, a series of thunderstorms moved into Bavaria from the west, which later transitioned into widespread continuous rain, leading to daily precipitation of over 100 mm along the Alpine edge on August 11. On August 12, the focus shifted to the Bavarian and Upper Palatinate Forest, resulting in a 100-year rainfall event of 104 mm in 24 hours in Waldkirchen. From August 6 to 12, over 340 mm of rain was recorded in parts of southern Bavaria. On August 12, flood peaks formed on the Danube tributaries Iller, Günz, Mindel, Zusam, Schmutter, Paar, and Lech. In the district of Oberallgäu, 100-year events were observed in some areas. On August 14, a long wave formed on the Danube between the Lech mouth and Regensburg, corresponding to a 10- to 20-year flood. Also on August 12, peak levels were recorded on the rivers Isar, Loisach, Ammer, Mangfall, Tiroler Achen, Traun, Saalach, and Salzach, with return periods ranging from 50 to 100 years. The flood wave of the Inn led to a water level of 10.80 m and a discharge of 7700 m³/s in Passau on August 13 at 1 PM, corresponding to a 50-year event. This level was last exceeded in 1954 (12.20 m) and again in 2013 (12.89 m). While the flood of the Salzach in Burghausen reached a 50-year magnitude, only a 2- to 5-year event was observed on the Inn in Wasserburg. Thus, the 20- to 50-year flood of the Inn was significantly influenced by the Salzach from the mouth of the Salzach. The Sylvenstein reservoir held back up to 23.3 million cubic meters of water, preventing a larger Isar flood. Without the reservoir, a discharge of up to 730 m³/s would have occurred in Bad Tölz on August 12 instead of the actual 295 m³/s. With the shift of the rain area to the north, an extreme flood with return periods often exceeding 100 years occurred on the night of August 13 on the rivers in the catchment area of the Regen and Ilz. At the confluence of the Regen with the Danube in Regensburg, a level of 6.63 m was recorded on August 14 at 1 PM, leading to a 20-year flood up to the Isar mouth at Deggendorf and a 10-year flood further to Passau."

                "content": "The rain situation was particularly dramatic in the central and eastern Ore Mountains, where on August 12/13, 2002, in Zinnwald, a 24-hour value of 312 mm was recorded, the highest daily precipitation since the beginning of routine measurements in Germany. Due to the poor condition of the forests in these areas and the already accumulated water, the ground could not absorb such massive amounts of rainfall, causing the water to flow immediately into the valleys. The rivers originating in this area that flow into the Mulde or Elbe, such as Zschopau, Flöha, Zwickauer Mulde, Freiberger Mulde, Gimmlitz, Rote Weißeritz, Wilde Weißeritz, and Müglitz, swelled to several times their usual size within hours, leaving enormous damage in their wake. Many bridges were swept away, roads were undermined, houses were flooded and severely damaged, and power and telephone supplies collapsed; entire villages were evacuated or cut off from the outside world. The Müglitztal was particularly affected. Here, the flood wave devastated Glashütte, Schlottwitz, Weesenstein, Mühlbach, Burkhardswalde, the lower town of Dohna, and Heidenau. In Glashütte, on August 12, 2002, around 5:00 PM, a small retention basin on the Prießnitz, a lower tributary of the Müglitz, broke. The flood wave, with an estimated 50,000 cubic meters of water in the Prießnitztal, raised the water level in Glashütte by another meter, but had little impact on the flooding in the Müglitz because the Prießnitz flows further downstream into the Müglitz. In many places, energy, water, and heating supplies failed. The flooding of federal, state, and county roads hindered emergency services. In the area of the Gottleuba and Seidewitz rivers, the flood reached the threshold of flooding in Pirna on August 12 at around 5:00 PM. The Gottleuba and Seidewitz overflowed after their confluence in Pirna by up to 1.50 meters. In Dresden, the damage was caused not only by the first wave of the Weißeritz on August 12/13 but also by the second, higher wave of the Elbe on August 16/17. On August 12, 2002, at around 6:00 PM, a disaster alarm was triggered for Dresden. In the city center, the main train station, the Semper Opera, the Zwinger, and the state parliament were flooded. Friedrichstadt was partially evacuated. In the following days, the disaster situation exceeded flood warning level IV in some areas. Built-up areas were completely flooded in places, and the use of water and dam defense on a larger scale became necessary. There were also fatalities. It was not until August 13, 2002, that the dimensions of the natural disaster became fully visible. More places were cut off from the outside world by the subsequent water masses. In Krippen, the water rose to the second floor. Grimma was hit by the flood of the Mulde and severely destroyed, including the historic Pöppelmann Bridge. On August 14, Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder visited the city. The city of Döbeln was completely flooded by the Freiberger Mulde. In the evening, tram services in Dresden were completely suspended. On August 15, Meißen was hit by the first flood wave, partially destroying the local porcelain factory. By this time, Pirna was already reached by the second wave. Now entire villages in the Saxon Switzerland had to be evacuated. In Dresden, the districts of Laubegast, Kleinzschachwitz, and Zschieren were flooded. On August 16, traffic on the railway lines Leipzig–Dresden, Riesa–Chemnitz, and Jüterbog–Röderau, which cross the Elbe floodplain on a common dam, was suspended. A dike breach at Röderau undermined a road bridge and a flood passage of the railway embankment, causing these structures to collapse. In the evening, the flood peak reached Schöna at the border with the Czech Republic with a maximum level of 12.04 meters. On August 17, 2002, the water level in Dresden reached its peak of 9.40 meters at 7:00 AM. On that day, all Elbe bridges in Dresden were closed except for the A4 motorway bridge. In absolute comparison of flow rates, the Elbe flood of 2002 ranked fifth among the recorded high floods in Saxony. Therefore, a recurrence interval of 100 to 200 years is assumed for such floods. The Torgau gauge reached a peak value of 9.49 meters on August 18. On August 26, the disaster alarm for Dresden was lifted. A total of 21 people lost their lives due to the flooding in Saxony."

About 4,600 people were evacuated from low-lying neighborhoods of Dessau by the evening of August 14. In the Bitterfeld-Wolfen chemical park (most affected was the Bayer Group), an environmental disaster was prevented through the massive deployment of helpers. The city of Bitterfeld itself was increasingly flooded in the following days. Near the city, a dam on the Mulde broke on August 15, flooding the former lignite open-pit mine Goitzsche. On the same day, the Pretzien weir south of Magdeburg was opened, which helped avert the greatest damage in the city area. Nevertheless, around 20,000 people were evacuated from the eastern districts of Magdeburg, and a disaster alarm was triggered for the city. Additionally, the Brandenburg city of Mühlberg was evacuated, and the cities further downstream prepared protective measures. On August 16, at 1 a.m., the crisis team decided to evacuate around 10,000 people from Bitterfeld and the surrounding area, as the city was gradually being overtaken by the floodwaters. In Saxony-Anhalt, about 2,000 soldiers of the Bundeswehr were deployed. On August 17, the water level in Mühlberg reached its peak at 9.96 m. On August 18, several dikes broke in Saxony-Anhalt at Seegrehna and Wittenberg on the Elbe, as well as at Dessau on the Mulde. In the Dessau district of Waldersee, the water quickly rose to two meters high. A sandbag logistics center was set up at Leipzig/Halle Airport to supply all threatened areas. On August 19, the situation on the A9 highway intensified, but a single-lane traffic flow was ensured. The floodwaters flowed north faster than expected. The first flood wave reached the state capital Magdeburg, which, not least due to the Elbe diversion canal, got off lightly. When the town center of Rehsen threatened to flood on August 20, the residents of the village broke through the dike of the inhabited Schönitzer Polder themselves to relieve their own dike. The fire chief of Rehsen and four other individuals were subsequently charged by the public prosecutor's office for dike destruction, but they were acquitted due to lack of evidence of specific involvement. By August 21, more than 60,000 people had been evacuated from threatened areas in Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. On August 22, around 16,300 soldiers of the Bundeswehr were deployed in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Brandenburg. On August 26, the disaster alarm for Magdeburg was lifted. Due to the slowly receding water, the disaster alarm in Dessau could only be lifted on September 13, after 32 days."

This resulted in untreated wastewater entering the Elbe. In Saxony, there were 21 fatalities due to the flood. From 2002 to 2009, 700 million euros were spent on protection projects, of which 50% came from EU funds. In evaluating the flood, a total of 300 flood areas were declared over an area of 76,000 hectares. In Saxony-Anhalt, the damage in agriculture amounted to around 420 million euros. Damage and follow-up effects to the facilities of Deutsche Bahn amounted to 1.025 billion euros, of which 750 million euros were attributed to the Free State of Saxony.

Initially affected was South Bohemia with the catchment areas of the Vltava, Lužnice, Malše, and Blanice rivers, later also of Berounka, Otava, and Sázava. Since August 11, 2002, the water masses from the Eger and Biela rivers in Northwest Bohemia were added. Within nine days in August, the affected regions received rainfall equivalent to three summer months of the long-term average amount. Above-average rainfall had already occurred in June and July, and the soil's storage capacity was exhausted. Initially, numerous places in the flat area around České Budějovice were flooded, and the emerging danger was underestimated. The Vltava's dams, filled to the brim, should have released about 1000 m³/s of water as a precaution, which would have mitigated the later peak. At the beginning of the second week, the water level in Prague rose to seven meters. Now the overflows had to be opened. Along with the South Bohemian water masses from the Vltava at 3000 m³/s, an additional 2000 m³/s came from the unregulated rivers Sázava and Berounka before Prague. In Prague, the normal flow is 150 m³/s, but at that time an estimated 5300 m³/s was reached. The flooding of the Old Town was prevented by barriers on the riverbanks. However, the subway ceased operations. The district of Karlín had to be evacuated. At the confluence of the Vltava and Elbe rivers near Mělník, the water masses could spread into the plain. The village of Zálezlice, located near the mouth, was two-thirds destroyed. At the downstream bottleneck of the Bohemian Switzerland, the water backed up. The crossing into Germany occurs through the narrow Elbe valley of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The peak level in Ústí nad Labem (Aussig) was reached on the afternoon of August 16, 2002. The water flow of the Elbe exceeded the previous highest level from 1845. The water volume in the Vltava exceeded the amount from 1845 by almost one-fifth."

Around 1,000 animals were evacuated from the Prague Zoo, but 134 others (including 10 mammals) died in the floods. The Prague Metro was filled to two-fifths and could only be fully operational again in March 2003. The damage to the subway amounted to around 280 million euros. Near the confluence of the Vltava and Elbe rivers, the Czech chemical and pharmaceutical plant Spolana in Neratovice was flooded, washing away waste and operating materials. One of the 17 flood victims was a 53-year-old man who was fatally struck by a metal shard while watching the explosion of a free-floating inland ship in Děčín."

The SPD-led federal government reacted immediately to the flood disaster and initiated the largest deployment of the Bundeswehr in the country since its existence. As early as August 20, 2002, about 45,000 soldiers of the Bundeswehr were deployed in the affected regions to reinforce dikes, carry out evacuations, and coordinate disaster relief. Numerous politicians, including Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, regularly visited the affected areas under significant media attention. The federal government quickly allocated 385 million euros to support the people affected by the flood in their rebuilding efforts. Payments amounted to 500 euros per person and up to 2,000 euros per household. Affected businesses received a flat rate of 15,000 euros and 500 euros per employee. On August 26, the federal government decided on a draft law for a 7.1 billion euro state fund for reconstruction aid in the flood areas, which the Bundesrat approved on September 13. A political science study concludes that the flood relief measures of the SPD-led German federal government increased the SPD's share of votes in the affected areas by at most seven percentage points in the 2002 federal elections and by two percentage points in the 2005 federal elections. Critics argue that politics and administration drew only minimal actual consequences from the flood. Of the 35,000 hectares of land identified in 2002 as potential flood areas along the Elbe, less than five percent were realized. Additionally, various construction bans provided for in state laws were often circumvented by district administrators with exceptions."

Due to the flood disaster, the Schüssel I government, with the approval of the FPÖ ministers, decided to postpone the tax reform that had been promised to voters by the FPÖ. This and other differences of opinion prompted Haider and other members of the right-wing party wing, such as Ewald Stadler, to demand the convening of a special party congress (Knittelfeld FPÖ Assembly 2002) from the party leadership under the more liberal Susanne Riess-Passer and to collect signatures from the elected delegates. The events of this assembly led to a power shift within the party, the resignation of several FPÖ ministers, thus breaking the first FPÖ-ÖVP coalition under Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, and ultimately to early elections (National Council election in Austria 2002), in which the FPÖ lost almost two-thirds of its voters. The Freedom Party also lost significant voter support in most state elections (except in Carinthia) between 2003 and 2005. In the municipal council and mayoral elections in Carinthia in 2003, municipal council elections in Lower Austria in 2005, and later also in Styria, the FPÖ had to forfeit voters. After the electoral defeat in the municipal council elections in Lower Austria in 2005, the former chairman of the FPÖ, Jörg Haider, proposed a re-establishment of the FPÖ as a \"casual, lively, and young\" party, whose leadership he would be willing to take over \"in case of emergency.\" When this proposal did not receive unanimous support within the party, and a contested vote against the Vienna FPÖ chairman Heinz-Christian Strache was anticipated at a party congress scheduled for April 23, he announced on April 4, 2005, the founding of the new party Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) and declared his intention to become its first chairman. The BZÖ subsequently replaced the FPÖ in the Schüssel II government."

Affected were, among others, the Czech tributaries Vltava and Ohře, parts of the two Mulde rivers, and almost the entire course of the Elbe from Hradec Králové (Krieggrätz) through the Czech and Saxon upper reaches to the northern German middle and lower reaches. Especially in the lower middle reaches, the flood is comparable to the flood of 2002, but it passed through the river course in a much longer flood wave. In early April, some towns, such as Hitzacker in Lower Saxony, were largely flooded. The mark of the century flood of 2002 was reached or even exceeded in some places. In Lauenburg, this happened as early as April 7."

                "content": "The trigger for the flooding was strong thawing weather in the low mountain ranges upstream of the Elbe. In the ridge areas of the Ore Mountains, the Bohemian Forest, and the Giant Mountains, snow depths of over 1.5 meters accumulated throughout the winter. Due to previous short thaw processes and the long duration of snow cover, the snow was comparatively strongly compressed and rich in water. At the end of March, a strong temperature spike and high precipitation led to the rapid melting of the snow masses. In the Ore Mountains, precipitation was relatively low, so there was no dangerous flooding in the tributaries of the upper Elbe. At the beginning of March, there were already floods in these waters, which appeared more dangerous due to ice shifts. Heavy rainfall occurred at the end of March, particularly in southern Czechia and the central Bohemian Basin. Further causes must be sought for the significant swelling of the river in the lower middle course. On the one hand, dike systems were raised and renewed along entire stretches in southern Saxony-Anhalt since 2002. These held back the Elbe and prevented the flooding of retention areas as in 2002. This is accompanied by unfavorable river engineering. Another reason for exceeding the flood mark of 2002 north of Magdeburg lies in the stretched flood wave, which triggered the highest alarm levels simultaneously along the several hundred kilometers stretch from Lower Saxony to the mouth of the Vltava. In the middle course, the flow velocity decreased, leading to the compression of the wave."

Aside from disruptions in road traffic (closure of numerous riverside roads and the Loschwitz Bridge), Dresden was little affected by the flood. The district of Gohlis, whose dike is designed for 7.40 meters, was the most at risk. Cities such as Bad Schandau, Pirna, and Meißen were flooded more severely than Dresden. In Dresden, most of the damage was caused by flooded basements, although there were also isolated cases, such as in Zschieren, where houses were flooded.

The cause of the prolonged and intense precipitation was a Vb weather situation. In this case, the air masses deviate from their usual west-east direction towards the Mediterranean in the south. Here, these air masses warm up and absorb a lot of moisture. After crossing the Alps towards the north, they encounter the cold air there, cool down significantly, and extreme precipitation occurs in a relatively short time. This weather situation was also the cause of the Oder flood (1997) and the Elbe flood (2002)."

                "content": "Starting from September 24, 2010, there were widespread heavy rainfall in the Elbe-Elster region. Between the Fläming and the Saxon Upper Lusatia, more than 100 liters of rain per square meter fell from September 24 to September 27. As a result, on September 29, flood warning level 4 was reached at the Schwarze Elster and its two tributaries, Große Röder and Pulsnitz, which flow into it near Elsterwerda. After flood alert level 3 had to be declared the day before throughout the Elbe-Elster district and a crisis team was formed, District Administrator Christian Jaschinski was forced to declare a disaster alarm at 11:50 AM on that day. Due to rising water levels, preparations began in Elsterwerda for the voluntary evacuation of the city center, which was at risk of flooding, where the water level of the Schwarze Elster had risen to about 3.50 meters. The official gauge in Bad Liebenwerda, located about ten kilometers downstream, also measured 3.50 meters. By evening, the tense situation required the first roads and bridges to be closed. While the newly constructed important Elster Bridge in Elsterwerda remained open, bridges leading over the Schwarze Elster in Saathain and Bad Liebenwerda, as well as the partially flooded federal highway 169 near Plessa, the district road 6207 between Saathain and Stolzenhain, and the local road through Schmerkendorf had to be closed. In Ortrand, where the Pulsnitz overflowed, the federal highway A 13 also had to be closed due to flooding. The escalating situation also attracted increased media interest, with several television teams from public and private broadcasting stations reporting live from the region. On Thursday, September 30, all schools in Elsterwerda, Bad Liebenwerda, and Herzberg, as well as schools in Annaburg for students affected by the flood, were closed. On that day, record high water levels were measured at all gauges along the Schwarze Elster, reaching previously unrecorded values. The measured peak discharge of the Schwarze Elster in Löben was now 128 m³/s, corresponding to a discharge characteristic of HQ 200. The water level in Bad Liebenwerda reached an unprecedented absolute high of 3.55 meters that night. From then on, it began to slightly decrease here, while the levels in the downstream locations continued to rise. The situation remained critical at the increasingly softening dikes of the Schwarze Elster. Weak points and cracks, such as between Kotschka and Saathain, where the dike began to flood over a length of about 50 meters, were sealed as quickly as possible by emergency services and the help of residents rushing to assist with sandbags. For safety reasons, voluntary evacuation of about 2,700 residents began in Elsterwerda at that time, with announcements made via loudspeakers from police vehicles driving through the city and public postings urging them to leave their homes and properties. The district hospital located in close proximity to the river was also evacuated using ambulances and helicopters. About 100 patients were transferred from there to nearby hospitals such as Herzberg, Finsterwalde, Lauchhammer, Riesa, Großenhain, or Dresden within about four hours. Despite all the efforts of the emergency services, a disaster occurred the following day about twenty kilometers upstream from the mouth of the Elster. On October 1, at around 12:50 PM, the left dike of the Schwarze Elster broke near Meuselko at a water level of 3.34 m, measured at the Löben gauge. Just over four hours later, at around 5:00 PM, a disaster alarm was finally declared for the entire Wittenberg district. Eight hours later, parts of the village of Löben, located two kilometers downstream, were flooded, and the district of Waltersdorf was cut off from the outside world. The prolonged peak of the flood meant that the disaster alarm for the Elbe-Elster district, except for the city of Herzberg/Elster, was only lifted on October 6. On October 7, with the permanent drop below flood warning level 4 at the Löben gauge, the disaster alarm for the Wittenberg district and the city of Herzberg was lifted. The dike that broke at Meuselko over a length of about 30 meters was closed on October 5, while levels remained constant and were still rising in some areas."

Additionally, up to 2000 helpers were deployed. The estimated damages in agriculture in Brandenburg amounted to about 3 million euros. The costs for the nine-day disaster response in the Elbe-Elster district were reported to be up to 2 million euros. Immediate damages caused by the flood to hydraulic structures in the Wittenberg district are estimated at 670,000 euros. The preliminary estimated costs for dike renovation in Brandenburg (as of 2011) are reported to be up to 50 million euros, with another 50 million euros planned by the state of Saxony-Anhalt for the renovation of dikes on the Black Elster by 2020. In the eastern part of the Annaburger Heide, several hectares of forest were destroyed due to the overall more than five-month flooding and a high groundwater level caused by the flood."

                "content": "Due to the strong straightening of the riverbed, which mostly took place in the middle of the 19th century, the Black Elster now flows as a canal through the landscape. The extensive floodplain forests adjacent to the river and the meandering course of the Black Elster disappeared, as recurring floods no longer had the opportunity to use these areas as compensation spaces, which also caused the water levels to rise with each flood, leading to further expansion of flood protection facilities. Just a few years after the regulation of the Black Elster began, the newly constructed dikes broke in 1861 due to a flood. Flooding was also reported in the years 1862, 1871, 1895, and 1907. Another devastating flood on the Black Elster became known in 1926. A breach of the Röder dam near the small village of Würdenhain flooded the entire village on June 18, 1926. The flood affected almost all the rivers in the area, including the Röder, Pulsnitz, Black Elster, and Little Elster, causing huge damage. In the floodplain of the then district of Bad Liebenwerda, two-thirds of the harvest were destroyed that year. Downstream, an area of up to 144 hectares of flooded land was reported in the Mönchenhöfe area. In June of the following year, during the summer flood, a breach of the Elster dam occurred near Mückenberg (Lauchhammer-West), which could only be closed with great difficulty."
