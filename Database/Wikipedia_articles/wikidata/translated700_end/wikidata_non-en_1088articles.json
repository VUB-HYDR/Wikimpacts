                "content": "The 2017 Pacific typhoon season refers to any tropical cyclones that formed in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and west of the International Date Line, including the South China Sea, at any time during 2017. Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to the waters of the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2017 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) with international names and are assigned international numbers starting with 17xx. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter \"W.\" Tropical depressions that enter or form within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) are given local names by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (with the international name being the official one). Additionally, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau may differ from those used in Taiwan. The information for each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak intensity during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

The observatory predicted that the annual rainfall would be normal to below normal, with four to seven tropical cyclones entering within 500 kilometers of Hong Kong, a number close to the normal level. However, during June to August of that year, four consecutive storms directly hit Hong Kong, prompting the observatory to issue tropical cyclone warning signals of No. 8 or above, far exceeding expectations. As a result, the observatory revised its forecast in late August to six to nine tropical cyclones, reaching the normal level."

On June 26, the Central Weather Bureau held a typhoon outlook press conference, forecasting that 3 to 5 typhoons would hit Taiwan during the summer, with the climate average being 3.6. The total number of typhoons forming in the western North Pacific was estimated to be about 21 to 25, close to the climate average of 23.1. Lu Guochen, director of the Weather Forecast Center, stated that the climate this year is normal, with a low likelihood of El Niño or La Niña events. Therefore, the formation and impact of typhoons this year are also expected to be normal. Regarding the intensity of typhoons hitting Taiwan, he mentioned that there is a 70% to 80% chance of them being of moderate typhoon strength or above, and the possibility of autumn typhoons cannot be ruled out, reminding the public to prepare for typhoon prevention."

Although this low-pressure area formed over the open ocean, its center was initially very disorganized. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the disturbance number 93W at 9 a.m. on the 20th of the same month, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rated its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low\" at 8 a.m. on the 21st. With the assistance of high atmospheric pressure, low wind shear, and relatively high sea temperatures, the low-pressure area began to consolidate, and its structure became more organized. Major weather agencies predicted its movement path to be west-northwest, with some agencies optimistic about its development and intensity, while others were less so.  \n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency first upgraded it to a tropical depression at 8 p.m. on the 23rd, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center subsequently raised its rating to \"medium\" at 4 a.m. on the 24th, then to \"high\" at 1 p.m. the same day. Benefiting from favorable environmental conditions nearby, the low-pressure area continued to develop, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression at 2 a.m. on April 25, assigning it the number 03W. The Japan Meteorological Agency also issued a gale warning for Tropical Depression 03W at 8 a.m. on the same day.  \n\nAs Tropical Depression 03W rapidly developed and intensified, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical storm at 2 a.m. on April 26, followed by the Japan Meteorological Agency at 8 a.m., which also upgraded it to a tropical storm, assigning it the international number 1701 and naming the tropical cyclone \"Muifa.\" It became the first named tropical cyclone of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season.  \n\nAlthough the tropical storm was named, major weather agencies were not optimistic about its subsequent intensity development and predicted it would change direction, shifting from west-northwest to north and then to east-northeast, due to the influence of an eastward-moving westerly trough. As expected, \"Muifa\" moved along the weak point of the subtropical ridge southeast of Japan, gradually moving toward the westerly trough and slowly weakening.  \n\nAs \"Muifa\" weakened, the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded it to a tropical depression at 8:50 p.m. on April 27, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning at 5 a.m. the next day. The Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 8 p.m. on the 29th. Finally, \"Muifa\" dissipated over the open ocean east of the Philippines, with some of its cloud systems merging into an extratropical cyclone."

It moved northwestward from the waters east of the Philippines to the waters east of Taiwan, gradually intensifying into a severe tropical storm before turning northeastward. Its first landfall was in Nagasaki City, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan; the second landfall was in Uwajima City, Ehime Prefecture; and the third landfall was in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture.

However, it eventually developed independently and intensified into a severe tropical storm. It made landfall in Vietnam's Nghe An Province at 2:10 a.m. on July 17. After landfall, its intensity rapidly weakened due to the frictional effects of the terrain and dissipated on July 18. Although it had dissipated, the trailing airflow brought heavy rain to the northern South China Sea and the coastal areas of South China."

Six hours later, authorities issued a gale warning, and on the morning of the 21st, it was upgraded to a tropical storm, given the international designation 1705, and named Oma. On the afternoon of the 23rd, it began to be influenced by Tropical Storm Rose and took a southeastward path, while also rapidly intensifying. Between the 25th and 27th, it gradually absorbed Rose and resumed a westward path, with its intensity significantly decreasing. On the evening of the 27th, it shifted to a southwestward movement, approaching the Ogasawara Islands. From the night of the 30th to the 31st, it rapidly intensified again to reach the strength of a Category 5 hurricane. It weakened to a typhoon on August 5 and made landfall on Yakushima, Japan. On the morning of August 8, although its structure had already become loose, it still affected northern Japan. In the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's best track data, Oma's maximum wind speed was downgraded from 140 knots (equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane) to 135 knots (equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane)."

As Mawar intensified, a baroclinic system west of the International Date Line gradually transformed into a low-pressure area on the morning of the 19th, and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the tropical disturbance number 97W at 9 a.m. The low-level circulation center of this low-pressure area was partially exposed to the west due to dry air intrusion and vertical wind shear, but its eastern outflow channel continued to improve, and the warm sea surface provided sufficient energy. The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded this low-pressure area to a tropical depression at 2 a.m. on the 20th, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low\" three hours later (at 5 a.m.). \n\nIn the afternoon, its deep convection gradually filled the previously exposed eastern side of the low-level circulation center, organizing a broader low-level circulation center. Its extratropical cyclone characteristics also gradually weakened. Additionally, as the system was located beneath a strong upper-level low-pressure area, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its rating to \"medium\" at 2 p.m. and classified the system as a subtropical depression. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning at 3:30 p.m., indicating the possibility of intensifying into a tropical storm within a day. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the system to a subtropical storm at 8 a.m. on the 21st, then raised its rating to \"high\" at 1:30 p.m. and issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. The Japan Meteorological Agency officially upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm at 3:15 p.m., naming it Rose and assigning it the international number 1706. The China Meteorological Administration followed suit at 3:48 p.m. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center subsequently announced at 5 p.m. that the system had transitioned into a tropical storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 09W.\n\nInitially influenced by a deep subtropical ridge, Rose moved northward. On the morning of the 22nd, it shifted westward, approaching Tropical Cyclone Mawar, and developed a \"pinhole eye\" in the afternoon. In the evening, Rose moved into cooler waters, and its subtropical characteristics re-emerged. Temperature scanning systems indicated that Rose developed partial cold-core structures, suggesting it was a \"hybrid system.\" Its low-level circulation center was once again exposed, with upper-level convection dissipating, though low-level clouds continued to spiral into the center. By the 24th, it formed a central dense overcast area. On the 25th, Rose began interacting with Mawar, and Mawar's outflow caused strong vertical wind shear on Rose, leading to significant weakening. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded Rose to a tropical depression at 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., respectively, with the latter issuing its final warning at 11 a.m. on the 26th. Rose rotated counterclockwise around Mawar and was fully absorbed into Mawar's circulation by midnight on the 28th."

Shortly after Talas dissipated, a low-pressure area formed in the central Philippine Sea on July 19, and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the disturbance number 96W. Initially, major agencies believed Sanka would develop further, with a chance of making landfall near the Pearl River Estuary. However, predictions later changed, forecasting it to move toward Hainan Island as a tropical depression. Initially, it had strong convection, but after entering the southern South China Sea, its intensity began to weaken due to high wind shear and low sea temperatures. However, as it moved to the central South China Sea, it strengthened again, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression at 11 a.m. on July 21. Although it redeveloped, its intensity did not significantly increase and it lingered near the waters off Hainan Island, even exhibiting a slight Fujiwhara effect with Roke. After Roke moved inland into Shenzhen, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Sanka at 3 p.m. on July 23. Subsequently, it made landfall in Quang Binh Province, Vietnam, at 4:30 p.m. on July 25.

Influenced by a strong subtropical high-pressure ridge, there was a lull in the typhoon season in the Northwest Pacific from late September to early October, until the subtropical high-pressure ridge shifted northward, allowing tropical disturbances to redevelop in the Northwest Pacific. On October 11, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned disturbance number 91W to a low-pressure system near the Chuuk Islands. The combination of warm sea temperatures and weak wind shear facilitated the intensification of this disturbance. On October 15, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to Tropical Depression 25W, and the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm the next day, naming it, with meteorological agencies subsequently upgrading its status. On October 17, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a typhoon. On the morning of October 20, Lan's cloud-wrapped eye expanded into a large eye, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center indicated that Lan had entered a rapid intensification phase. On the afternoon of October 20, the China Meteorological Administration and the Hong Kong Observatory upgraded Lan to a severe typhoon. At 2 a.m. on October 21, the Hong Kong Observatory upgraded it to a super typhoon, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also upgraded Lan to a super typhoon, while the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded it to a severe typhoon at 8 a.m. On October 22 at 2 p.m., the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan downgraded Lan to a moderate typhoon. At 3 a.m. on October 23, it made landfall in Kakegawa City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.

Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. In 2015, tropical storms formed in this region every month, marking the first time this occurred since the Japan Meteorological Agency began keeping records. \n\nThis article is limited to the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms forming in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are referred to as hurricanes and are included in the 2015 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (international names) with international identification numbers starting with 15xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigns tropical depressions in this region identification numbers ending with the letter W.\n\nTropical depressions entering or forming within the Philippine Area of Responsibility are given local names by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). Additionally, as China, Hong Kong, and Macau use the same Chinese translations, while Taiwan may use different Chinese names, a single storm may have two different Chinese names. The information for each tropical cyclone is based on its peak intensity during its existence.\n\nThe tropical cyclones of the 2015 season were notably stronger, making it the season with the most super typhoons (13 in total) since the Hong Kong Observatory adopted a new tropical cyclone classification system in 2009, which added the categories of \"severe typhoon\" and \"super typhoon.\" It was also the first season to have four super typhoons before June."

He also mentioned that the typhoon season might begin in June or later. The Observatory planned to extend the forecast period for tropical cyclone tracks from 3 days to 5 days during the typhoon season of that year. However, the Director noted that due to the erratic movement of some tropical cyclones, the 5-day forecast would still have significant errors. On June 20, following the formation of Tropical Storm Kujira, the Observatory implemented the 5-day tropical cyclone track forecast. Affected by the El Niño phenomenon, after Typhoon Linfa directly hit Hong Kong in early July, there were nearly three months without any tropical cyclones affecting Hong Kong until early October, when Severe Typhoon Mujigae hit, ending this rare lull. This not only marked the second consecutive year without storms hitting Hong Kong in August but also made it the first typhoon season since records began in 1946 where no storms hit Hong Kong in both August and September. As a result, on August 22, the Hong Kong Observatory revised the expected number of tropical cyclones entering the 500-kilometer range to 3 to 6, which is considered normal to slightly below normal."

The first tropical cyclone is expected to appear in mid-June. The Macao Meteorological Bureau will use the electronic display screen outside the Barrier Gate Building to release warnings about tropical cyclones, heavy rain, or storm surges."

Affected by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon, typhoons are expected to develop further east, and higher sea surface temperatures may result in stronger typhoons, all of which are expected to be at least moderate typhoons. Authorities also predict that the likelihood of typhoons affecting Taiwan is higher in summer than in autumn."

The number of typhoon wave events in the South China Sea region throughout the year is expected to be close to the annual average, about 8 to 10 times. At the same time, the report predicts that 3 to 4 typhoon wave events will severely affect the coastal areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan during the year, with 2 to 3 of these events severely impacting the Guangdong coast. Additionally, during the period from July to September, 1 to 2 strong typhoons or super typhoons may bring disastrous wave events to South China. The first typhoon wave event affecting the South China coast may occur from late June to early July, slightly later than the annual average, while the last typhoon wave event affecting the South China coast may occur from late September to early October, slightly earlier than the annual average. [4] \n\nFurthermore, according to the Hainan Provincial Meteorological Bureau's forecast on May 23, during the flood season (May to October) of that year, 3 to 4 tropical cyclones are expected to affect Hainan Island, 2 fewer than the annual average. One tropical cyclone is expected to make landfall on Hainan Island, 1 fewer than the annual average. The intensity of tropical cyclones affecting Hainan Province is expected to be stronger than the annual average. The first tropical cyclone affecting Hainan Island may occur in mid-July, and the last one may occur in late October. [5] The Haikou Meteorological Bureau also predicted on May 26 that 3 to 4 tropical cyclones would affect Haikou City during the year, with 1 to 2 of them causing severe impacts or making landfall in Haikou City.

However, this record was broken by Typhoon Surigae in 2021. Maysak was also one of the tropical cyclones recorded by the Japan Meteorological Agency to reach the \"violent\" typhoon classification in March and April. According to the Hong Kong Observatory's classification, Maysak was the second tropical cyclone of that year to reach the super typhoon level (the first being Typhoon Higos in February), indicating that it was the first season since the Hong Kong Observatory introduced the new tropical cyclone classification system in 2009, adding the \"severe typhoon\" and \"super typhoon\" levels, to have two super typhoons appear before or in April. Although Maysak's movement path followed the \"westward\" storm pattern of the Northwest Pacific typhoon season, moving directly from the Northwest Pacific through the Philippines into the South China Sea, this type of path generally occurs from June to October. Maysak taking this path in April was extremely rare. As a result, Maysak became the first storm since Typhoon Neoguri in 2008 to enter the northern South China Sea in April. At that time, the environment in the South China Sea was unfavorable for tropical cyclone development, and Maysak was ultimately weakened and dissipated in the northern South China Sea under the influence of the northeast monsoon, a situation similar to tropical cyclones entering the northern South China Sea in November."

                "content": "PAGASA: Nona  \nA low-pressure area formed approximately 120 kilometers south of Chuuk State on the evening of December 7, 2015, and moved west-northwest along the deep easterly winds on the southern side of the subtropical ridge. The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression at 8 a.m. on December 9. Although the Northwest Pacific experienced a period of calm for over half a month after Typhoon In-fa in November, with sea surface temperatures rising above 28 degrees Celsius, restoring a significant energy supply, the system's initial development was slow and disorganized due to strong vertical wind shear. By December 10, as wind shear weakened and upper-level divergence strengthened, the system began to develop deep convection, and a low-level circulation center formed. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning for the system at 8:45 p.m., indicating it was expected to strengthen into a tropical storm within a day. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 1:30 p.m. the following day (December 11). However, half an hour later, the Japan Meteorological Agency officially upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it Melor and assigning it the international designation 1527. At that time, Melor was located approximately 50 kilometers south of Yap Island. This led the Hong Kong Observatory, which had not previously mentioned the system, to suddenly announce at 4:15 p.m. that \"the low-pressure area in the Northwest Pacific has intensified into a tropical depression and has been named Melor.\" The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also upgraded Melor in two consecutive advisories, first classifying it as a tropical depression with the designation 28W at 11 p.m. and then upgrading it to a tropical storm at 5 a.m. on December 12. The Hong Kong Observatory followed suit at 9:45 a.m.\n\nOn December 14, Typhoon Melor made landfall in the Philippines.  \nOn December 17, Melor transitioned into a low-pressure area."

Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. In 2015, tropical storms formed in this region every month, marking the first time this occurred since the Japan Meteorological Agency began keeping records. \n\nThis article is limited to the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are referred to as hurricanes and are included in the 2015 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) with international names and are assigned international numbers starting with 15xx. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter \"W.\"\n\nAny tropical depressions that enter or form within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) are given local names by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for local warning purposes. As a result, a storm may have two different English names (with the international name being the official one). Additionally, since China, Hong Kong, and Macau use the same Chinese name, while Taiwan may use a different Chinese name, a single storm may have two different Chinese names. The information on each tropical cyclone is based on its peak intensity during its existence.\n\nThe tropical cyclones of the 2015 season were notably stronger, making it the season with the most super typhoons (13 in total) since the Hong Kong Observatory adopted a new tropical cyclone classification system in 2009, which added the categories of \"severe typhoon\" and \"super typhoon.\" It was also the first season to have four super typhoons before June."

He also mentioned that the typhoon season might begin in June or later. The Observatory planned to extend the forecast period for tropical cyclone tracks from 3 days to 5 days during the typhoon season of that year. However, the Director noted that due to the erratic movement of some tropical cyclones, the 5-day forecast would still have significant errors. On June 20, following the formation of Tropical Storm Kujira, the Observatory implemented the 5-day tropical cyclone track forecast. Affected by the El Niño phenomenon, after Typhoon Linfa directly hit Hong Kong in early July, there were nearly three months without any tropical cyclones affecting the region until early October, when Severe Typhoon Mujigae ended this rare lull. This not only marked the second consecutive year without storms hitting Hong Kong in August but also made it the first typhoon season since records began in 1946 where no storms affected Hong Kong in both August and September. As a result, on August 22, the Hong Kong Observatory revised the expected number of tropical cyclones entering the 500-kilometer range to 3 to 6, which is considered normal to slightly below normal."

The first tropical cyclone is expected to appear in mid-June.

Influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon, typhoons are expected to develop further east, and higher sea surface temperatures may result in stronger typhoons affecting Taiwan, all of which are expected to be at least moderate typhoons. Authorities also predict that the likelihood of typhoons impacting Taiwan is higher in summer than in autumn."

The number of typhoon wave events in the South China Sea region throughout the year is expected to be close to the annual average, about 8 to 10 occurrences. At the same time, the report predicts that 3 to 4 typhoon wave events will severely affect the coastal areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan during the year, with 2 to 3 of these events severely impacting the Guangdong coast. Additionally, during the period from July to September, 1 to 2 strong typhoons or super typhoons may bring disastrous wave events to South China. The first typhoon wave event affecting the South China coast may occur from late June to early July, slightly later than the annual average, while the last typhoon wave event affecting the South China coast may occur from late September to early October, slightly earlier than the annual average. [4] \n\nFurthermore, according to the Hainan Provincial Meteorological Bureau's forecast on May 23, during the flood season (May to October) of that year, 3 to 4 tropical cyclones are expected to affect Hainan Island, which is 2 fewer than the annual average. One tropical cyclone is expected to make landfall on Hainan Island, which is 1 fewer than the annual average. The intensity of tropical cyclones affecting Hainan Province is expected to be stronger than the annual average. The first tropical cyclone affecting Hainan Island may occur in mid-July, and the last one may occur in late October. [5] The Haikou Meteorological Bureau also predicted on May 26 that 3 to 4 tropical cyclones would affect Haikou City during the year, with 1 to 2 of them causing severe impacts or making landfall in Haikou City.

                "content": "PAGASA: Chedeng Maysak was once the strongest tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere on record from January to April, with its maximum sustained wind speed near the center and central pressure surpassing the record of Typhoon Andy in 1989. However, this record was broken by Typhoon Surigae in 2021. Maysak was also one of the tropical cyclones recorded by the Japan Meteorological Agency to reach the \"violent\" typhoon rating in March and April. According to the Hong Kong Observatory's classification, Maysak was the second tropical cyclone of the year to reach the super typhoon level (the first being Typhoon Higos in February), indicating that it was the first season since the Hong Kong Observatory introduced the new tropical cyclone classification system in 2009, adding the \"severe typhoon\" and \"super typhoon\" levels, to have two super typhoons appear before or in April. Although Maysak's movement path followed the \"westward\" storm pattern of the Northwest Pacific typhoon season, moving from the Northwest Pacific through the Philippines into the South China Sea, this type of path generally occurs from June to October. Maysak taking this path in April was extremely rare. As a result, Maysak became the first storm since Typhoon Neoguri in 2008 to enter the northern South China Sea in April. At that time, the environment in the South China Sea was unfavorable for tropical cyclone development, and Maysak was ultimately weakened and dissipated in the northern South China Sea under the influence of the northeast monsoon, a situation similar to tropical cyclones entering the northern South China Sea in November."

The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression at 8 a.m. on December 9. Although the Northwest Pacific had experienced over half a month of inactivity since Typhoon In-fa in November, with sea surface temperatures rising above 28 degrees Celsius, restoring a significant energy supply, the system's initial development was slow and disorganized due to strong vertical wind shear. By December 10, as wind shear weakened and upper-level divergence strengthened, the system began to develop deep convection, and a low-level circulation center formed. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning for the system at 8:45 p.m., predicting it would intensify into a tropical storm within a day. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 1:30 p.m. the following day (December 11). However, half an hour later, the Japan Meteorological Agency officially upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it Melor and assigning it the international designation 1527. At that time, Melor was located approximately 50 kilometers south of Yap Island. This prompted the Hong Kong Observatory, which had not previously mentioned the system, to suddenly announce at 4:15 p.m. that \"the low-pressure area in the Northwest Pacific has intensified into a tropical depression and has been named Melor.\" The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also upgraded Melor in two consecutive advisories, first classifying it as a tropical depression with the designation 28W at 11 p.m. and then upgrading it to a tropical storm at 5 a.m. on December 12. The Hong Kong Observatory followed suit at 9:45 a.m.\n\nOn December 14, Typhoon Melor made landfall in the Philippines.  \nOn December 17, Melor transitioned into a low-pressure area."

                "content": "A low-pressure area formed east of Guam on September 13, 2015, and was designated as tropical disturbance 96W by the United States Naval Research Laboratory. On the following day (14th) at midnight, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rated its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low,\" but three hours later, it skipped the \"medium\" rating and directly upgraded it to \"high,\" issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Additionally, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression at 2 a.m. and issued a gale warning at 8 a.m.  \n\nAt 2 a.m. on September 15, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the system to a tropical depression and assigned it the designation 20W. That day, the system developed slowly, with loose organization and erratic movement, following a serpentine path. After moving west-northwest, it suddenly turned 90 degrees to the northeast, but half a day later, under the influence of the subtropical ridge, it turned northwest again, resuming its original direction. The system then began to consolidate in an environment with weak vertical wind shear, steadily intensifying. On the following day (16th) at 2 a.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm, assigned it the international designation 1520, and named it Krovanh. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also upgraded Krovanh to a tropical storm at the same time. Nine hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded Krovanh to a severe tropical storm. By this time, Krovanh's central dense overcast had formed, and it began to develop a \"cloud-filled eye.\"  \n\nDue to the subtropical ridge dominating the northwest Pacific, the deep easterly flow to its south guided Krovanh steadily on a west-northwest track at a speed of about 15 kilometers per hour. Benefiting from weak vertical wind shear, warm sea temperatures, and favorable upper-level outflow, Krovanh continued to intensify on the 17th, establishing dual outflow channels toward the equator and the poles. Its central dense overcast further consolidated, and an eye opened. At 2 a.m., both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded Krovanh to a typhoon. That day, Krovanh moved to the southwest side of the subtropical ridge, with its path shifting northwestward and maintaining a speed of about 15 kilometers per hour. Krovanh also reached its peak intensity that evening.  \n\nOn the following day (18th), Krovanh turned clockwise along the western side of the subtropical ridge, taking a north to north-northwest track. At the same time, dry air intrusion on its western side weakened convection, and the system began to be affected by the westerlies, with vertical wind shear significantly increasing, causing Krovanh to weaken.  \n\nOn the 19th, Krovanh's movement gradually shifted northeastward, and its intensity continued to decline. The eye became blurred, turning into a \"cloud-filled eye.\" The Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded Krovanh to a tropical storm at 8 p.m., and the Japan Meteorological Agency followed suit at 2 a.m. on the 20th, downgrading it to a severe tropical storm. Due to stronger wind shear and reduced energy supply from cooler sea temperatures, Krovanh's central dense overcast was destroyed, deep convection was displaced northeastward, and the eye was completely filled. The low-level circulation center was even partially exposed. With cold air intrusion, Krovanh gradually developed frontal characteristics, beginning its transition into an extratropical cyclone. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning on Krovanh at 8 p.m., and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical storm, stating at 2 a.m. on the 21st that Krovanh had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.  \n\nThe system continued to move northward but suddenly turned southward east of Hokkaido before gradually shifting eastward. Krovanh's remnants persisted for a full week, eventually dissipating on the 28th."

Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This year marked the first time since records began by the Japan Meteorological Agency that no tropical storms formed in the Northwest Pacific during August (except for Genevieve, which did not form in this region and actually developed in late July). [1] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms forming in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are referred to as hurricanes and are included in the 2014 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms forming in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency's Tokyo Typhoon Center (international names) and are assigned international numbers starting with 14xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigns tropical depressions in this region numbers ending with the letter W. Any tropical depressions entering or forming within the Philippine Area of Responsibility are given Philippine names by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (with the international name being the official one). Additionally, since Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China use the same Chinese name, while Taiwan may use a different Chinese name, a single storm may have two different Chinese names. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its strongest form during its existence."

However, due to the system being far from land, its impact on land was minimal, mainly during its extratropical cyclone phase. The system originated from a large low-pressure area near Guam, and at 8 PM on October 28, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the disturbance number 96W. The system developed into a tropical depression on October 30, became a tropical storm on October 31, and developed into a typhoon on November 1. The system underwent explosive intensification on November 2, rapidly clearing a small eye with a radius of less than 15 kilometers, and reached super typhoon intensity that evening, achieving its peak intensity early the next day. On November 3, the parrot began an eyewall replacement cycle, and its intensity gradually weakened. The parrot transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 7 and re-intensified to hurricane-force winds on the morning of November 8, with its pressure rapidly dropping to 924 hPa and a gale-force wind radius exceeding 3,300 kilometers, making it one of the largest storms in global history. The remnants of the extratropical cyclone Parrot brought a cold wave to North America, causing historically rare extreme cold weather during the same period."

Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This year marked the first time since records began by the Japan Meteorological Agency that no tropical storms formed in the Northwest Pacific during August (except for Genevieve, which did not form in this region and actually developed in late July). [1] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms forming in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are referred to as hurricanes and are included in the 2014 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms forming in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency's Typhoon Center in Tokyo (international names) and are assigned international numbers starting with 14xx. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter \"W.\" Any tropical depressions entering or forming within the Philippine Area of Responsibility are given a Philippine name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). Additionally, since Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China use the same Chinese name, while Taiwan may use a different Chinese name, a single storm may have two different Chinese names. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its strongest form during its existence."

It is anticipated that the typhoon season in Hong Kong will begin in June or later. Subsequently, the Hong Kong Observatory revised the forecasted number of typhoons from 4 to 7 to 3 to 6, emphasizing that typhoons are most likely to occur in September, and the public should remain vigilant."

The formation locations of typhoons are expected to be farther from Taiwan, and the typhoons at the beginning of the typhoon season are more likely to veer northward. However, attention should still be paid to the possibility of typhoons affecting Taiwan in August and September. On June 27, the Central Weather Bureau issued a press release stating that the total number of typhoons expected to form in the western North Pacific this year is approximately 29 to 32, which is higher than the climate average (25.7). As of the end of June, there have already been 7 typhoons formed in the western North Pacific, exceeding the climate average (4.3). Regarding typhoons affecting Taiwan, it is estimated that 3 to 5 typhoons will impact Taiwan this year, which is close to the climate average (3.6)."

On the same day, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the disturbance number 91W. At 10:30 AM on January 9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) rated its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"LOW.\" At 2:00 PM on January 10, the JTWC canceled the rating. At 9:30 PM, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical depression and issued a gale warning. Its central wind speed reached 15 meters per second (54 kilometers per hour).  \n\nAt 2:00 AM on January 11, the JTWC again rated its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"LOW.\" At 2:00 PM on January 12, the JTWC canceled the rating. At 3:25 PM, the JMA issued a general warning. At 2:00 AM on January 13, the JMA downgraded it to a low-pressure area and canceled all warnings. Subsequently, the remnants of the system, which had been downgraded to a low-pressure area by the JMA, redeveloped over the sea northwest of Palau.  \n\nAt 8:00 AM on January 14, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression again.

However, due to the system being far from land, its impact on land was minimal, mainly during its extratropical cyclone phase. The system originated from a large low-pressure area near Guam. At 8 PM on October 28, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the disturbance number 96W. The system developed into a tropical depression on October 30, became a tropical storm on October 31, and developed into a typhoon on November 1. The system underwent explosive intensification on November 2, rapidly clearing a small eye with a radius of less than 15 kilometers, and reached super typhoon intensity that evening, achieving its peak intensity early the next day. On November 3, the Parrot began an eyewall replacement cycle, and its intensity gradually weakened. The Parrot transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 7 and re-intensified to hurricane-force winds on the morning of November 8, with its pressure rapidly dropping to 924 hPa and a gale-force wind radius exceeding 3,300 kilometers, making it one of the largest storms in global history. The remnants of the extratropical cyclone Parrot brought a cold wave to North America, causing historically rare extreme cold weather during the same period."

Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This year marked the first time since records began by the Japan Meteorological Agency that no tropical storms formed in the Northwest Pacific during August (except for Genevieve, which did not form in this region and actually developed in late July). [1] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms forming in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are referred to as hurricanes and are included in the 2014 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms forming in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency's Typhoon Center in Tokyo (international names) and are assigned international numbers starting with 14xx. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter \"W.\" Any tropical depressions entering or forming within the Philippine Area of Responsibility are given a Philippine name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (with the international name being the official one). Additionally, as Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China use the same Chinese name, and Taiwan may use a different Chinese name, a single storm may have two different Chinese names. The information for each tropical cyclone is based on its strongest form during its existence."

It is anticipated that the typhoon season in Hong Kong will begin in June or later. Subsequently, the Hong Kong Observatory revised the forecasted number of typhoons from 4 to 7 to 3 to 6, emphasizing that typhoons are most likely to occur in September, and the public should remain vigilant."

The formation locations of typhoons are expected to be farther from Taiwan, and the typhoons at the beginning of the typhoon season are more likely to veer northward. However, attention should still be paid to the possibility of typhoons affecting Taiwan in August and September. On June 27, the Central Weather Bureau issued a press release stating that the total number of typhoons expected to form in the western North Pacific this year is approximately 29 to 32, which is higher than the climate average (25.7). As of the end of June, there have already been 7 typhoons formed in the western North Pacific, exceeding the climate average (4.3). Regarding typhoons affecting Taiwan, it is estimated that 3 to 5 typhoons will impact Taiwan this year, which is close to the climate average (3.6)."

However, due to the system being far from land, its impact on land was minimal, mainly during its extratropical cyclone phase. The system originated from a large low-pressure area near Guam, and at 8 PM on October 28, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the disturbance number 96W. The system developed into a tropical depression on October 30, became a tropical storm on October 31, and developed into a typhoon on November 1. The system underwent explosive intensification on November 2, rapidly clearing a small eye with a radius of less than 15 kilometers, and reached super typhoon intensity that evening, achieving its peak intensity early the next day. On November 3, the parrot began an eyewall replacement cycle, and its intensity gradually weakened. The parrot transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 7 and re-intensified to hurricane-force winds on the morning of November 8, with its pressure rapidly dropping to 924 hPa and a gale-force wind radius exceeding 3,300 kilometers, making it one of the largest storms in global history. The remnants of the extratropical cyclone Parrot brought a cold wave to North America, causing historically rare extreme cold weather during the same period."

Although no specific timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to the waters of the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2013 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency, with international numbers starting with 13xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in the region a number ending with the letter W.  \n\nFor tropical depressions that enter or form within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns them a Philippine name for local warning purposes. Additionally, since China, Hong Kong, and Macau use the same translated names, and Taiwan may use different translated names, the same storm may have two different Chinese names and sometimes two different English names (international name and Philippine name). The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its strongest form during its existence."

They are more likely to pass by the eastern or southern sides of Taiwan, but the accompanying southwest airflow should not be underestimated."

The JMA classified it as a severe tropical storm at 2 p.m. that afternoon [7]. Simultaneously, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as a tropical storm [8]. On the 19th, Pewa improved its low-level circulation center (LLCC) due to favorable convergence and began developing an eye, leading the JTWC to adjust its intensity rating [9]. However, on the following day, Pewa was affected by increased wind shear on the northwestern side, causing the LLCC to become fully exposed, prompting both the JMA [10] and JTWC to downgrade the system's classification [11]. Although the wind shear on the northwestern side weakened on the 22nd and the LLCC was no longer exposed, Pewa's poor structure led the JTWC to downgrade it to a tropical depression at 5 a.m. on the 24th [12] and issue its final advisory at 11 a.m. on the 25th [13]. The JMA downgraded it at 8 p.m. on the 25th [14] and assessed that Pewa became a low-pressure area and gradually dissipated by the 27th [15]."

On September 21, 13W intensified into a tropical storm near the Northern Mariana Islands and was named \"Malakas\" by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Initially, Malakas moved slowly westward under the influence of a subtropical high-pressure system to its north. Later, the subtropical high weakened and retreated eastward due to the influence of a westerly trough. Malakas absorbed the warm seawater from the weak point of the subtropical high, prompting the Japan Meteorological Agency to upgrade it to a severe tropical storm. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center even briefly upgraded it to a typhoon, but downgraded it the next day (later upgrading it again when Malakas moved significantly northward). After being upgraded by the Japan Meteorological Agency, Malakas nearly stalled near the Iwo Jima area in Japan. On September 23, Malakas began moving significantly northward, rapidly intensifying into a typhoon after passing through the waters near Iwo Jima. On September 24, after entering the westerlies, it was further upgraded to a severe typhoon by the Hong Kong Observatory, with its eye becoming notably large. At 6:50 PM on September 25, Malakas transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the waters east of Honshu, Japan. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued its final warning, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also issued its final warning at noon on September 26. Subsequently, in the best track analysis released by the Japan Meteorological Agency, Malakas' wind speed was revised upward to 85 knots, and its pressure was revised downward to 945 hPa."

Although no official timeframe is set for the typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December. This article is limited to the waters of the Pacific and South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2017 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) with international names and are assigned international numbers starting with 17xx. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter \"W.\" Tropical depressions that enter or form within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) are given local names by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (with the international name being the official one). Additionally, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau may differ from those used in Taiwan. The information for each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak intensity during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

However, during June to August of that year, four consecutive storms directly hit Hong Kong, prompting the observatory to issue tropical cyclone warning signals of No. 8 or above, far exceeding expectations. As a result, the observatory revised its forecast in late August to six to nine tropical cyclones, reaching the normal level."

On June 26, the Central Weather Bureau held a typhoon outlook press conference, forecasting that 3 to 5 typhoons would hit Taiwan during the summer, with the climate average being 3.6. The total number of typhoons forming in the western North Pacific was estimated to be about 21 to 25, close to the climate average of 23.1. Lu Guochen, director of the Weather Forecast Center, stated that the climate this year is normal, with a low likelihood of El Niño or La Niña events. Therefore, the formation and impact of typhoons this year are also expected to be normal. Regarding the intensity of typhoons hitting Taiwan, he mentioned that there is a 70% to 80% chance of them being of moderate typhoon strength or higher, and the possibility of autumn typhoons cannot be ruled out, reminding the public to prepare for typhoon prevention."

Although this low-pressure area formed over the open ocean, its center was initially very disorganized. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the disturbance number 93W at 9 a.m. on the 20th of the same month, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rated its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low\" at 8 a.m. on the 21st. With the assistance of high atmospheric pressure, low wind shear, and relatively high sea temperatures, the low-pressure area began to consolidate, and its structure became more organized. Major weather agencies predicted its movement path to be west-northwest, with some agencies optimistic about its development and intensity, while others were less so.  \n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression at 8 p.m. on the 23rd, followed by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center raising its rating to \"medium\" at 4 a.m. on the 24th and then to \"high\" at 1 p.m. the same day. Benefiting from favorable environmental conditions nearby, the low-pressure area continued to develop. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression and assigned it the number 03W at 2 a.m. on April 25, while the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning for Tropical Depression 03W at 8 a.m. the same day. As Tropical Depression 03W rapidly developed and intensified, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical storm at 2 a.m. on April 26, and the Japan Meteorological Agency followed suit at 8 a.m., upgrading it to a tropical storm, assigning it the international number 1701, and naming the tropical cyclone \"Muifa,\" making it the first named tropical cyclone of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season.  \n\nAlthough the tropical storm was named, major weather agencies were not optimistic about its subsequent intensity development and predicted it would change direction, shifting from west-northwest to north and then to east-northeast, due to the influence of the eastward-moving westerly trough. As expected, \"Muifa\" moved along the weak point of the subtropical ridge southeast of Japan, gradually moving toward the westerly trough and slowly weakening. As \"Muifa\" weakened, the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded it to a tropical depression at 8:50 p.m. on April 27, with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issuing its final warning at 5 a.m. the next day. The Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 8 p.m. on the 29th. Finally, \"Muifa\" dissipated over the open ocean east of the Philippines, with some of its cloud systems merging into an extratropical cyclone."

However, it eventually developed independently and intensified into a severe tropical storm. It made landfall in Vietnam's Nghe An Province at 2:10 a.m. on July 17. After landfall, its intensity rapidly weakened due to the frictional effects of the terrain, and it dissipated on July 18.

Six hours later, authorities issued a gale warning, and subsequently, on the morning of the 21st, it was upgraded to a tropical storm, given the international designation 1705, and named Olu. On the afternoon of the 23rd, it began to be influenced by Tropical Storm Rose and took a southeastward path, while also starting to intensify rapidly. Between the 25th and 27th, it gradually absorbed Rose and resumed a westward path, with its intensity significantly decreasing. On the evening of the 27th, it shifted to a southwestward movement, approaching the Ogasawara Islands. From the night of the 30th to the 31st, it intensified rapidly again to reach the strength of a Category 5 hurricane, weakening to a typhoon on August 5 and making landfall on Yakushima, Japan. On the morning of August 8, although its structure had already become loose, it still affected northern Japan. In the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's best track data, Olu's maximum wind speed was downgraded from 140 knots (equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane) to 135 knots (equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane)."

As Mawar intensified, a baroclinic system west of the International Date Line gradually transformed into a low-pressure area on the morning of the 19th, and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the tropical disturbance number 97W at 9 a.m. The low-level circulation center of this low-pressure area was partially exposed to the west due to dry air intrusion and vertical wind shear, but its eastern outflow channel continued to improve, and the warm sea surface provided sufficient energy. The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded this low-pressure area to a tropical depression at 2 a.m. on the 20th, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rated its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low\" at 5 a.m.\n\nIn the afternoon, its deep convection gradually filled the previously exposed eastern side of the low-level circulation center, forming a broader low-level circulation center. Its extratropical cyclone characteristics also gradually weakened. As the system was located under a strong upper-level low-pressure area, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its rating to \"medium\" at 2 p.m. and classified the system as a subtropical depression. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning at 3:30 p.m., indicating the possibility of intensifying into a tropical storm within a day. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the system to a subtropical storm at 8 a.m. on the 21st, then raised its rating to \"high\" at 1:30 p.m. and issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. The Japan Meteorological Agency officially upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm at 3:15 p.m., naming it Rose and assigning it the international number 1706. The China Meteorological Administration followed suit at 3:48 p.m. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center subsequently classified the system as a tropical storm at 5 p.m., designating it as Tropical Cyclone 09W.\n\nInitially influenced by a deep subtropical ridge, Rose moved northward before shifting westward on the morning of the 22nd, approaching Tropical Cyclone Mawar and developing a \"pinhole eye\" in the afternoon. In the evening, Rose moved into cooler waters, and its subtropical characteristics re-emerged. Temperature scanning systems indicated that Rose developed partial cold-core structures, suggesting it was a \"hybrid system.\" Its low-level circulation center was exposed again, with upper-level convection nearly dissipated, though low-level clouds continued to spiral into the center. By the 24th, it formed a central dense overcast area. On the 25th, Rose began interacting with Mawar, whose outflow caused strong vertical wind shear on Rose, leading to significant weakening. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded Rose to a tropical depression at 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., respectively, with the latter issuing its final warning at 11 a.m. on the 26th. Rose moved counterclockwise around Mawar and was fully absorbed into Mawar's circulation by midnight on the 28th."

Initially, major agencies believed Sanka would develop further, with a chance of making landfall near the Pearl River Estuary. However, predictions later changed, forecasting it to move toward Hainan Island as a tropical depression. Initially, it had strong convection, but after entering the southern South China Sea, its intensity began to weaken due to high wind shear and low sea temperatures. However, as it moved to the central South China Sea, it strengthened again, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical depression at 11 a.m. on July 21. Although it redeveloped, its intensity did not significantly increase and it lingered near the waters off Hainan Island, even exhibiting a slight Fujiwhara effect with Roke. After Roke moved inland into Shenzhen, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Sanka at 3 p.m. on July 23.

On October 11, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned disturbance number 91W to a low-pressure system near the Chuuk Islands. The combination of warm sea temperatures and weak wind shear facilitated the development of this disturbance, and on October 15, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to Tropical Depression 25W. The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm the next day and named it, with other meteorological agencies following suit. On October 17, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a typhoon.

The name (Cantonese: Saan1 Wu4, IPA: [saːn.wȕː]) was provided by Macau, and as the name suggests, it refers to the marine organism coral that lives in the ocean. Coral is a hard substance often used in decorations, formed by the accumulation of the skeletons of countless tiny marine animals."

At 2 p.m. on August 28, the Japan Meteorological Agency first upgraded it to a tropical storm and assigned it the international number \"1715,\" while the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan simultaneously upgraded it to a mild typhoon. Coral's circulation was extensive, with forecasts indicating that the diameter of Coral's circulation could reach 2,000 kilometers, covering a very wide area. On August 30, various meteorological agencies upgraded Coral to a severe tropical storm. On August 31, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan upgraded Coral to a moderate typhoon, followed by other agencies gradually upgrading it to a typhoon. On September 3, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan downgraded Coral to a mild typhoon. That evening, the Japan Meteorological Agency determined that Coral had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. In the \"2017 Tropical Cyclone Best Track Data\" released by the China Meteorological Administration on May 1, 2018, Coral's intensity was revised from 35 meters per second (125 kilometers per hour) to 40 meters per second (145 kilometers per hour), and Coral's central pressure was revised downward to 960 hPa."

Between August 30 and September 1, Typhoon Coral remained stationary around Chichijima, bringing about 330 millimeters of rainfall, setting a nearly 50-year rainfall record for Chichijima."

A low-pressure area formed near the waters of the Caroline Islands on June 16, and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the tropical disturbance number 94W. Initial computer numerical forecast models indicated that the system would generally move toward the waters near Luzon. On the evening of June 17, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rated the chance of the low-pressure area developing into a tropical cyclone within one day as \"low\" by 10:30 PM. Over the following days, the system moved northward at a speed of 20 km/h, developing in an environment of warm sea water, weak to moderate vertical wind shear, and good upper-level divergence, with increasing rotation. On the morning of June 20, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center raised the rating to \"medium,\" but by June 21, increased vertical wind shear hindered the system's development. At the same time, the system turned northwestward and accelerated west-northwestward by June 22. By June 23, the low-level circulation center of the system became partially exposed to the northeast, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to downgrade the rating to \"low\" by 9 AM.\n\nOn June 24, the system resumed moving northward at 20 km/h along the western side of the subtropical ridge, leaving the area of strong vertical wind shear, and its organization gradually improved. At this time, numerical forecast models indicated that the system would move toward the Ryukyu Islands and possibly transition into a subtropical cyclone and re-intensify. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center raised the rating back to \"medium\" at 2 PM and further upgraded it to \"high\" at 10 AM on June 25, issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert. The Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 2 PM and 5 PM, respectively, assigning it the number 07 and the local name \"Dodong.\" At this time, the system had turned east-northeastward and accelerated to a speed of 25 to 30 km/h. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a gale warning at 3:10 AM on June 26, indicating that the system was expected to strengthen into a tropical storm within one day.\n\nStarting in the early hours of June 27, the system exhibited some extratropical cyclone characteristics, with its cloud bands forming a comma shape and its low-level circulation center becoming difficult to identify, but it still slightly intensified. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center stated that the system had transitioned into a subtropical cyclone and strengthened into a subtropical depression, lowering the rating back to \"low\" at 9 AM and canceling the tropical cyclone formation alert. However, the Japan Meteorological Agency, which does not classify \"subtropical cyclones,\" continued to rate the system as a tropical cyclone. As the system's central wind strength reached level 8, it was officially upgraded to a tropical storm at 6 PM and named Sepat, with the international designation 1903. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also upgraded Sepat to a subtropical storm at 8 PM. At this time, Sepat erupted with convection, further accelerating to a speed of 60 km/h, moving east-northeastward, and rapidly crossing the waters south of Japan's Honshu, causing a noticeable semicircular effect. However, the Hong Kong Observatory did not upgrade Sepat to a tropical depression until 6:45 PM, while the China Meteorological Administration upgraded Sepat to a tropical storm at 8:35 PM. On the morning of June 28, the system passed southeast of Tokyo, Japan. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center canceled all ratings at 9 AM, and the Japan Meteorological Agency announced at 2:40 PM that Sepat had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone."

Carlos maintained its intensity until July 14, when it became a hurricane again and reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h on the morning of July 15. From then on, Carlos began to weaken rapidly due to less favorable weather conditions. The next day, Carlos degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its final advisory on the system.

                "content": "A low-level cyclonic circulation associated with an area of low pressure more than 1,400 km south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, began to show signs of organization as it disconnected from the intertropical convergence zone. On July 10, the cyclonic circulation and areas of deep convection were already well-organized enough for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify the system as the fourth tropical depression of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. Initially moving westward, the depression began to slowly intensify during that day, with two prominent storm bands, although the cyclonic center was located in an area with few deep convection zones. The tropical cyclone continued to form more areas of deep convection, and later that day, the system was well-organized enough to be declared by the NHC as Tropical Storm \"Carlos.\" Under excellent meteorological conditions, such as warm waters and low wind shear, Carlos continued to gradually intensify. During the early hours (UTC) of July 11, Carlos began to develop a dense cloud center, indicating that the intensification trend would not stop. After a brief period of stabilization in the storm's intensity during the morning and early afternoon of July 11, due to changes in Carlos's internal structure, an eye wall began to form at the center of the cyclonic circulation, indicating the return of Carlos's intensification trend. The intensification trend continued throughout the rest of that day, and the NHC classified Carlos as the second hurricane of the season that night (UTC) as the cyclone presented an eye-like structure at its circulation center. Continuously moving westward due to the influence of a subtropical high to its north, Carlos stopped intensifying again due to internal changes in the hurricane's structure; its eye disappeared, and its cyclonic circulation became slightly more asymmetric, even under excellent meteorological conditions. The trend of disorganization in the internal structure continued, and on the afternoon of July 12, Carlos began to weaken slowly. As a result, the NHC downgraded Carlos to a tropical storm that night (UTC); the weakening trend went against all tropical cyclone forecast models, which indicated a rapid intensification of the cyclone amid excellent meteorological conditions, such as near-zero wind shear and warm ocean surface waters. The weakening trend of the cyclone, even under excellent meteorological conditions for its development, proved to be a \"puzzle\" for hurricane specialists at the National Hurricane Center (NHC), who stated: In the early hours of July 14, Carlos's weakening trend stopped, and the tropical storm maintained its stabilized intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 km/h. However, the storm's cyclonic circulation was embedded in the intertropical convergence zone, which did not favor the resumption of its intensification. Nevertheless, Carlos was able to form new areas of deep convection starting from the night (UTC) of July 14 and began to gradually intensify again. At the same time, an eye-like structure formed at the center of its cyclonic circulation, indicating that the storm would strengthen again. Carlos remained stable until the night (UTC) of July 14, when it began to intensify rapidly again. A \"pinhole\" eye formed at the center of the cyclonic circulation, and the NHC reclassified the system as a hurricane. Carlos continued to intensify throughout the rest of that day and reached its peak intensity during the morning (UTC) of July 15, with maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h; at that moment, Carlos was a \"dwarf\" and annular hurricane, and its eye measured only 20 km in diameter. At a latitude of 10.2°N during its peak intensity, Carlos became the most intense hurricane to be active at latitudes below 11°N since reliable records of Northeast Pacific hurricanes began in 1966. However, Carlos began to gradually weaken from midday (UTC) on July 15 due to the continued degradation of its cyclonic circulation. Associated with this, the arrival of moderate wind shear began to negatively impact the cyclone; its areas of deep convection were displaced to the east of its cyclonic center. As a result, Carlos continued to weaken, and the NHC downgraded it to a tropical storm that night. During the morning (UTC) of July 16, the wind shear had already removed almost all of its areas of deep convection associated with the system, further deteriorating the storm. As a result, the NHC downgraded Carlos to a tropical depression. The system continued to decay amid moderate wind shear and being tied to the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). By that afternoon, nothing remained but a small cloud-free cyclonic spin of what was once a Category 2 hurricane. As a result, the NHC downgraded Carlos to a remnant low-pressure area and issued its final advisory on the system."

                "content": "Hurricane Guillermo formed from a broad area of meteorological disturbances that persisted southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula on August 12. Initially, the depression exhibited a well-defined low-level cyclonic circulation, and only modest intensification of the cyclone was forecast, as the depression moved west-northwest in response to a subtropical high to its north, and on this trajectory, it would encounter cooler waters. That day, the depression began to show the first signs of intensification as its upper-level outflow was well established, and two associated storm bands were well defined. Early on August 13, the application of the Dvorak technique, which determines the intensity of a tropical cyclone solely by its organization in satellite images, indicated that the depression was already well-organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify the system as a tropical storm, which was named \"Guillermo.\" Continuing to move west-northwest, Guillermo gradually intensified while located in a region with favorable meteorological conditions. That morning, the storm displayed a cyclonic storm band covering more than half of its cyclonic circulation. That afternoon (UTC), Guillermo began to develop a dense cloud center and an embryonic eye structure, indicating that the storm could intensify further. That night, new areas of deep convection formed in the northern quadrant of its cyclonic circulation, which had previously been devoid of any storm bands. Guillermo's gradual intensification trend was interrupted early on August 14 as the storm underwent changes in its internal structure. However, the storm's internal changes revealed that Guillermo was consolidating its cyclonic circulation. The storm bands formed a ring of deep convection areas. Additionally, an eye began to be seen in satellite images. With these changes, Guillermo resumed intensification and became the fourth hurricane of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season later that morning (UTC). Guillermo continued to gradually intensify as its convection areas became better established. The system's intensification trend persisted until that night, when Guillermo reached the intensity of a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. However, Guillermo's intensification trend was again interrupted. The temperature at the top of its convection areas increased, and its eye was covered by clouds, indicating weakening. Nevertheless, its convection areas became even better organized. As a result, Guillermo maintained its stable intensity. However, changes in Guillermo's internal structure revealed that the storm was once again ready to continue its intensification trend. During the early hours (UTC) of August 14, Guillermo underwent another period of rapid intensification and became the second major hurricane of the season when it reached the intensity of a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Guillermo continued to gradually intensify that day, reaching its peak intensity that afternoon, with maximum sustained winds of 205 km/h and a minimum atmospheric pressure in its eye of 954 hPa. However, from that night onward, Guillermo began to be negatively affected by cooler ocean waters (below 25°C) and more stable meteorological conditions, unfavorable for the continuation of a tropical cyclone. As a result, Guillermo began to gradually weaken and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane later that night (UTC). On August 15, Guillermo's weakening trend stopped, and the hurricane managed to maintain its intensity even in cold ocean waters for its sustenance. That afternoon, Guillermo also began to be affected by increased wind shear, which had been minimal in previous days. Even so, Guillermo managed to maintain its intensity with the formation of new areas of deep convection. However, Guillermo finally began to succumb to strong wind shear that night, when Guillermo weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. At that time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its final advisory on the system as the hurricane crossed the 140°W meridian, leaving its area of responsibility to enter the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) area of responsibility, which continued to monitor the system. Guillermo's eye was no longer visible early on August 17 as strong wind shear displaced convection areas to the east of the cyclonic circulation, leaving the circulation center practically exposed. Guillermo's rapid weakening trend continued, and the system weakened to a tropical storm later that morning. That afternoon, Guillermo's center was already completely exposed, as all its convection areas had been removed from the storm and dissipated by west-southwest wind shear. However, the storm's weakening trend was again interrupted, even under very strong wind shear exceeding 75 km/h. The interruption was attributed to the narrow atmospheric pressure gradient between the storm and a strong high-pressure area to its northeast. Meanwhile, Guillermo began to move northwest in response to a break in the subtropical high. Even under strong wind shear, Guillermo continued to maintain its intensity while moving northwest. However, the system failed to produce new convection areas from the night of August 19. At that time, all convection areas associated with Guillermo disappeared, and the system was downgraded to a tropical depression. During the early hours of August 20, Guillermo degenerated into a low-pressure area, and the CPHC issued its final advisory on the system."

As the tropical wave moved into the northeastern Pacific Ocean, it began to organize, and intense areas of convection formed in association with the system. On June 27, the wave became sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Two-E, about 920 km south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Initially, the cloud pattern was reasonably well-defined, with curved storm bands and well-established outflows. Low to moderate wind shear allowed new areas of convection to emerge, and later on June 27, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it Boris. However, the storm's strengthening trend was interrupted by increasing northwesterly vertical wind shear, which gradually confined the main areas of convection to the southeast of the low-level cyclonic center. But during the night (UTC) of June 29 and early morning of June 30, the vertical wind shear decreased, allowing the low-level cyclonic center to remain under the main areas of convection. As a result, Boris began to strengthen gradually again, and a rather irregular eye formed at the center of the cyclone, which soon dissipated with the formation of new areas of convection. Boris remained a strong tropical storm for about 24 hours before slightly strengthening and becoming a minimal hurricane on July 1. At the same time, an irregular eye reappeared in satellite images, along with a broken eyewall on its northern side surrounding the system. However, the eye did not persist, nor did its associated eyewall, indicating the beginning of a weakening trend. Consequently, later on July 1, Boris, moving into cooler waters, weakened to a tropical storm. Boris, which had been moving west-northwest and west since the beginning of its life cycle under the influence of a strong mid-level subtropical high, began to shift northwestward due to the weakening of the high caused by the passage of a mid-to-upper-level trough. Additionally, Boris began to move more slowly for the same reason. However, Boris unexpectedly strengthened again on July 2, becoming a minimal hurricane once more and showing a well-defined eye and eyewall. Nevertheless, Boris began to weaken rapidly as it encountered waters with temperatures around 24°C, which do not support tropical cyclone activity. As a result, later on July 2, the system weakened again to a tropical storm. From then on, the cold waters, wind shear, and dry, stable air began to rapidly weaken the system, and Boris weakened to a tropical depression early on July 4. The rapid weakening trend continued, and hours later, Boris degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area. Consequently, the NHC issued its final advisory on the system."

Being the eighth tropical cyclone, the seventh named tropical system, and the fourth hurricane of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season, Genevieve formed from a tropical wave a few hundred kilometers off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Moving westward for almost its entire existence, Genevieve gradually intensified, strengthening into a hurricane four days later. However, the hurricane soon encountered more hostile weather conditions and began to weaken rapidly, ceasing to be considered a tropical cyclone on July 27 and dissipating completely four days later. Since Genevieve remained far from the coast throughout its life cycle, no preparations were made, and no impact was reported as a result of the cyclone's passage."

                "content": "A tropical wave, which almost developed into an Atlantic tropical depression off the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua on July 17, entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin on July 18. Moving parallel to the Pacific coast of Central America and southern Mexico, areas of cloudiness and thunderstorms showed signs of organization, and on July 21, the low-pressure area associated with the system became organized and developed into Tropical Depression Eight-E about 400 km south-southeast of Acapulco, on Mexico's Pacific coast. Initially, the depression's center was in the southeastern quadrant of the main convection areas due to the effect of moderate wind shear. Hours later, new areas of deep convection formed within the system, helping to increase the maximum sustained winds from 55 km/h to 65 km/h. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, naming it Genevieve. However, the trend of rapid intensification was hindered by strong wind shear, which briefly compromised the cyclone's vertical structure, causing a slight displacement of the mid-level cyclonic center northwestward relative to the low-level cyclonic circulation. Nevertheless, the wind shear did not prevent Genevieve from slowly intensifying as areas of deep convection gradually increased, aiding the cyclone's strengthening. The intensification trend was interrupted again on July 23 when Genevieve began moving over cooler waters left by Hurricane Fausto days earlier. Shortly thereafter, Genevieve began to weaken slightly due to increased wind shear. The slow weakening trend continued, with most of Genevieve's associated deep convection areas dissipating by July 24; the remaining deep convection areas were asymmetrically distributed around the system's cyclonic circulation. However, later that day, Genevieve began to intensify slowly again. An irregular eye started to become visible within the convection areas. As a result, Genevieve became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale on July 25, the fourth of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season, about 945 km southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. However, the intensity of a minimal hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h, was Genevieve's peak intensity. Its eye disappeared later that day, and Genevieve began to weaken rapidly as it entered a region of cooler ocean waters. Consequently, Genevieve weakened to a storm late on July 25. The rapid weakening trend continued, and its overall structure gradually deteriorated. As a result, on July 26, Genevieve lost all its deep convection areas due to the effects of cooler waters, wind shear, and a stable atmosphere, with satellite images showing only a nearly cloud-free cyclonic circulation. Rapidly degenerating, Genevieve became a tropical depression late on July 26, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the system early on July 27 (UTC) when Genevieve degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area. Genevieve's remnant low-pressure area continued westward for several more days, dissipating completely on July 31 as it entered the central-north Pacific Ocean basin."

Deep convection was erupting around the low-level circulation center. An upper-level storm and a tropical upper tropospheric trough were providing outflow. Over the next few days, the disturbance gradually developed before being declared dissipated early on July 28 as the low-level circulation center became poorly defined and higher vertical wind shear affected the system. However, the disturbance was regenerated early on July 30 while located about 630 km (390 miles) away, with the low-level circulation center of the disturbance elongated and showing signs of multiple circulation centers. Later that day, PAGASA reported that the disturbance had developed into a tropical depression and assigned it the local name Jolina. Jolina then further intensified early the next day and was reported to have become a tropical storm by PAGASA, with JMA designating it as a depression later that day. Early on August 1, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as deep convection increased and began consolidating around a circulation center. However, later that morning, Jolina made landfall near Casiguran, in the province of Aurora, Philippines, before emerging into the South China Sea later that day. Early the next day, the JTWC reissued their TCFA while PAGASA issued their final warning on Jolina as it exited their area of responsibility heading towards a landfall in China. Subsequently, the JTWC designated the depression as 08W that day as infrared imagery showed deep convection being drawn into the low-level circulation center. On August 3, the JMA reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a tropical storm and assigned the name Goni to the storm. At 1700 UTC on August 4, Goni made its second landfall in Macau. Early the next day, the JTWC issued their final warning on Goni. On August 7, the JTWC noted that the remnants of Goni had re-entered the Gulf of Tonkin and had a low chance of regeneration. Later that day, the JTWC reissued advisories on the system, upgrading it to a tropical storm near Hainan Island."

During the aftermath of the hurricane, diesel generators were delivered to the villages of Abagur-Lesnoy and Listvyagi, and field kitchens were organized. In some areas, people were left without electricity, heat, and water for three days, and in the village of Kruglenkoye for five days. To oversee the elimination of the consequences, Deputy Prosecutor General of Russia Dmitry Demeshin arrived in the region."

The reports on exactly how many people perished vary, but it was around a hundred people. A low-pressure system moved eastward, over the border between Götaland and Svealand. Locally, it also rained, and on January 29, 1850, mild air spread around the freezing point."

A funnel cloud formed. Two tornadoes were observed, although it is unclear whether the two merged into the devastating tornado or if one intensified while the other dissipated. Initial damage was documented in Peisching in the Piesting Valley, about 15 kilometers west-northwest of Wiener Neustadt. The tornado is said to have formed on a slope in the village. From there, a continuous path of destruction extended to the Leitha River east of Wiener Neustadt. In Dreistetten, a few houses were severely damaged, and the first personal injury occurred: a soldier on leave was swept into the air and suffered a severe leg injury. The tornado moved east-southeast at a speed of approximately 40 m/s. It crossed a small ridge, causing forest damage, before reaching the heated Steinfeld plain. Over the Wiener Neustadt airfield, there was a significant change in direction to the southeast. It is possible that the tornado merged here with the tornado moving in from the north. The tornado then crossed residential areas of Wiener Neustadt. It devastated the Josefstadt district with an intensity of F2 on the Fujita scale and changed its direction to the east. Over the Wiener Neustadt locomotive factory, it reached an intensity of F4, destroying most of the old factory. At the Daimler plant, the intensity was still F2. Shortly before the Leitha floodplain near Lichtenwörth, the tornado felled trees for the last time and finally dissipated. The tornado occurred between 5:30 PM and 6:00 PM, with no precise records of its start and dissipation times. It covered a total distance of about 20 kilometers. The average diameter of the tornado was 300 meters, its maximum damage-causing width was 600 meters, and the observed maximum diameter was 1,000 meters. According to modern calculations, it can be concluded that the tornado reached wind speeds of more than 300 km/h. Since there are no direct measurements of wind speed, the assessment of wind speed and intensity on the TORRO and Fujita scales was based on the damage patterns."

The tornado is still considered the most devastating weather event in Austria and the strongest tornado on Austrian soil to date. On the European list, the tornado ranks fourth in terms of the number of fatalities."

Because the tornado moved through sparsely populated areas, the number of destroyed houses was limited. One person was seriously injured. A total forest area of 460 hectares suffered severe damage, and high-voltage pylons were blown over.[2] Queen Juliana, accompanied by Princesses Irene and Margriet, visited the victims in Kootwijk and the royal domain near Hoog Soeren, which had also sustained damage.[3] Subsequently, she donated a significant amount to the National Disaster Fund Foundation for the benefit of the affected municipalities.[4]"

The phenomenon, which moves almost in a straight line northward, spans a strip 150 to 300 meters wide and 6 kilometers long through the 6th, 1st, 3rd, and 10th arrondissements, affecting notably: Place Saint-Sulpice, Quai des Grands-Augustins, where trees are uprooted and booksellers' boxes scattered; the Seine, where several barges sink or are damaged; Pont Saint-Michel, Île de la Cité, Pont au Change; Place du Châtelet, where the theater's roof is partially torn off; Rue Réaumur, where the damage is most striking, Rue de Turbigo; Place de la République, Boulevard Saint-Martin, Boulevard de Magenta, then Canal Saint-Martin, where a woman and her child are thrown into the water; Hôpital Saint-Louis and Boulevard de la Villette, where a funfair is devastated. The press reports that, according to witnesses, the whirlwind does not rise higher than the treetops and notably leaves the top of the Saint-Jacques Tower intact. It also moves in the manner of a \"rubber ball, by successive leaps.\" Among the victims are: an English jockey, Alfred Eyears, who was in an open carriage and was, according to sources, either thrown \"ten meters high\" or more soberly \"crushed by the fall of a chimney\" at Quai des Orfèvres; a laborer, Mr. Vanderhagle, killed by a lead sheet torn from a roof; a five-year-old child, Antoine Rouché, killed by a tree branch; a porter at Les Halles, suffering from a heart condition, who died the next day while recounting his accident; the wife of a bargeman, Mrs. Lefebvre, struck by a tree branch on her sinking barge.

Additionally, a low-pressure system near Hokkaido intensified, and the atmosphere above the Abashiri Subprefecture, where Saroma Town is located, was extremely unstable. For this reason, the tornado is believed to have been caused by a supercell. Furthermore, strong cold air was present on the western side of the cold front, and in Osaka, located on the western side of the front, the first \"Kogarashi\" (cold wind signaling the arrival of winter) was observed. However, in Tokyo, located on the eastern side of the front, temperatures were comparable to those of mid to late September. Around Saroma Town, it is believed that the area was within a meteorological zone with an extremely sharp temperature difference."

Two of these huts were blown away along with their roofs by a gust of wind and collapsed. At the time, many workers had gathered in the meeting room on the second floor of one of the prefabricated huts for a meeting, resulting in nine fatalities. The cause of death in all cases was brain contusion, which is typical of tornado disasters.  \n\nOn the other hand, despite the extensive damage to the residential area, the residents of the affected area suffered only nine injuries. This was because, at the time of the tornado, many residents were away from their homes, attending a funeral in the neighborhood, and thus coincidentally avoided the tornado's impact.  \n\nAt the site, large trucks were easily blown away, the roofs of relatively new houses were torn off, and utility poles were uprooted and blown away, illustrating the severity of the damage. Debris was scattered over areas more than 10 kilometers away from the disaster site.  \n\nDue to the collapse of numerous utility poles, a power outage occurred in 631 households in parts of Saroma Town and Kitami City until around 10 p.m. on November 7 (as announced by the Hokkaido Electric Power Kitami Branch). Additionally, residents near the site were evacuated."

In the capital, the occasional sound of fireworks explosions and remnants of the previous night's Christmas celebrations could still be heard. By 2:00 PM, some residents were preparing to take a nap with the drizzle that had started to fall. Then tragedy struck. At 3:15 PM, a funnel-shaped cloud began descending toward the ground. Many witnesses were stunned by the event until they started seeking shelter upon seeing houses, trees, cables, and other objects being lifted into the air. Sheets of metal from warehouses violently wrapped around trees that the winds could not uproot. The tornado moved forward with gusts exceeding 300 km/h, heavy rain, hail, and lightning. Some residents in the city center watched the phenomenon in amazement from tall buildings, while the tornado caused destruction in the area of the CPC on Route 20, particularly in the neighborhoods of Ameguino Norte, San Roque, and Villa La Tela, where most of the deaths, injuries, and damage occurred."

Unfortunately, five lives were lost, more than 90 people were injured, and about 5,000 were evacuated. The Police could not prevent unknown individuals from stealing belongings left outdoors after the storm. In other nearby towns like Villa Carlos Paz or La Calera, less intense damage was reported. The strong and sudden rise of rivers filled lakes and reservoirs to their limits, prompting the National Government and DIPAS to order the opening of floodgates, causing post-dam rivers to rise sharply as well. The tornado was classified as F3: that is, winds of 290 to 320 km per hour."

The path of the greatest damage stretched along the branch of the Morava River in a relatively narrow strip from Víska to the brewery and Chořelice up to Březové. The most affected part of Litovel was G. Frištenský Street and its immediate surroundings. The storm broke trees, smashed doors and windows, and tore off roofs. Eleven houses were structurally damaged, and two were ordered to be demolished. The Security Council of the Olomouc Region declared a state of danger for the town and its local part, Chořelice. The entire integrated rescue system of the Olomouc Region was involved in the damage removal, and the army also assisted."

The tornado occurred around 11:20 a.m. outside the San Carlos Municipal Cemetery, where it destroyed some flower shops, moved eastward along Navotavo Street, a busy area in the city, destroying and damaging houses in its path, and disappeared about 500 meters further up, where it destroyed a large part of a hardware store. It originated from the appearance of a cloud called \"Cumulonimbus,\" which forms after a frontal system, such as the one that affected Chile during those days. The cloud, in turn, was caused by a sudden temperature change, explained by the warming of the ground and the cold air, which creates atmospheric pressure between the ground and the air; this produces a downdraft from the cloud to the ground, which spins at speeds between 200 to 250 kilometers per hour (the San Carlos tornado reached 228 km/h) and moves randomly with a force capable of destroying everything in its path. It is worth noting that the phenomenon remains active as long as the temperature difference between the ground and the air is significant, usually lasting no more than 20 minutes (the San Carlos tornado lasted 12) before disappearing."

At the time of the tornado, the \"Violeta Parra Sandoval High School\" was in the middle of classes, with about 600 students and staff inside, who, according to local news reports, \"took cover under the tables while the windows shattered and the roof was blown off.\" This caused chaos among parents in the area who, in addition to the confusion caused by this unusual event, were withdrawing their children amidst the chaos, with one person injured. Other schools and high schools in the city were also forced to release students due to the collective panic in the city. Regarding damages, the Violeta Parra High School was left with some classrooms without roofs and broken windows, classes were suspended for one week, a wall on Navotavo Street collapsed, blocking part of the road, city collective transit was halted, and a power outage affected Cachapoal, Ninquihue, and San Fabián de Alico. Additionally, two community centers and about five flower shops located outside the Municipal Cemetery were affected. However, the symbol of the disaster was the \"Almet Hardware Store,\" which was severely destroyed and became the media figure of the tornado. In terms of personal injuries, no fatalities were reported, but there were two injuries: one inspector from Violeta Parra High School who was struck by a zinc sheet from the school's roof, and one pedestrian on Navotavo Street who was injured by the collapse of a wall. In the end, 103 homes were affected to varying degrees, 47 of them uninhabitable, with a total of 412 people affected and 232 displaced."

It followed a SW-NE trajectory. It caused severe material damage and fatalities (47, according to some sources). Augusto Arcimís—in his chronicle of May 22, 1886, in La Ilustración Española y Americana—details the occurrence of two separate tornadoes that day; one that reportedly began at 6:50 PM near Carabanchel Alto and another at 7:01 PM. The phenomenon was treated by scientists of the time as \"the passage of a cyclone\" rather than a tornado. The event is mentioned by Benito Pérez Galdós in his novel Misericordia."

The sky was so dark that it was difficult to read indoors. The hailstones fell with terrible force and were the size of hazelnuts, some even the size of pigeon eggs. The paths in the parks were covered with leaves and branches. Around 6 PM, a strong storm wind developed as the air cooled, appearing in gusts and gaining significant force, then it began to rain with lightning and thunder. Trudering was heavily affected by the hail. Hailstones the size of chicken eggs fell from the sky, and all the windows on the west side of the newly built schoolhouse were shattered. Many birds, partridges, and hares were killed outdoors. Roofs in Feldkirchen and Salmdorf were also damaged by the hail.\"[3]"

The swath was on average 600 meters wide, and in some places up to 1,500 meters wide. It was a so-called \"wedge tornado.\" The whirlwind was a so-called multi-vortex tornado, meaning it consisted of several sub-vortices.

Ahead of the cold front, heavy rainfall with thunderstorms moved eastward over northern Germany from the Netherlands. A shortwave trough at high altitude intensified the lifting processes at the air mass boundary. In southern Germany, the development of thunderstorms was prevented until the evening by a strong foehn wind, which reached gusts of up to 120 km/h on the Zugspitze. In these thunderstorms, some of which were accompanied by hail, certain gusts reached hurricane strength. At least six tornadoes emerged from these thunderstorms in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, with the tornado in Bützow being the strongest. A tornado observed in Groß Laasch reached strength F2. The two tornadoes in Brüel and Ahrensbök reached strength F1. Additionally, there were several suspected tornado cases, including in Lübeck."

The tornado hit 9 public buildings, including 4 schools, 1 health center, the municipal gymnasium, the municipal stadium, and 2 Socio-Educational Centers. According to public authorities' forecasts, the reconstruction of the damages may take three years. The Chaco Low-Pressure System, located between the southern region of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, is considered the second most favorable place in the world for the development of major storms, which can result in tornadoes. This region is known as the Tornado Corridor of South America. The state of Santa Catarina has already recorded about seven tornadoes in recent years.

Later, the rain had stopped, and like the hail, according to testimonies, everything was very \"calm and silent.\" The clock struck 6:30 PM, and a massive funnel touched down a few meters from the station, moved towards it, and destroyed everything in its path. The tornado lasted just over 2 minutes, leaving only 5 houses standing. The wind exceeded 370 km/h [citation needed], and a 15-year-old girl was sucked in by the tornado, lifted about 7 meters, and then violently thrown to the ground."

The French Observatory of Tornadoes and Severe Storms (Keraunos) classifies it as an EF2 intensity tornado[1], on the Enhanced Fujita scale. It caused significant damage in its path, such as partially destroyed homes. It is part of a tornado outbreak (clustered tornado episode) that totaled 3 cases for the day of September 16, 2015, including the EF1 tornado in Courtenay (Loiret) and the EF1 tornado in Jandun (Ardennes)[1]. This tornado is said to have traveled more than 70 km, making it the second-longest distance traveled by a tornado in France, after the EF4 tornado in Saint-Claude on August 19, 1890[3],[4]. It formed at 4:10 PM in the municipality of Chaniers, crossed the municipalities of La Chapelle-des-Pots, Saint-Césaire, Saint-Bris-des-Bois, Villars-les-Bois, Migron, Mons, Prignac, Thors, Matha, Sonnac, Haimps, Massac, Beauvais-sur-Matha, Bazauges, Ranville-Breuillaud, Barbezières, Lupsault, Saint-Fraigne, Ébréon, Souvigné, Courcôme, Raix, La Faye before dissipating in Condac around 5:05 PM. In total, the tornado crossed 24 municipalities in Charente and Charente-Maritime[5]. Its maximum intensity seems to have been reached between the municipalities of Thors and Sonnac, where the damage was most significant."

                "content": "The day of Wednesday, September 16, 2015, saw the placement of a depression trough of 985 hPa over the Bay of Biscay, inducing a strong southwesterly flow ahead of this depression. This barometric trough was located south of a large upper-level trough, which had also absorbed the former tropical storm Henri. At altitude, a fairly strong southwesterly jet stream had formed, bringing tropical and humid air. Already during the night of September 15 to 16, a succession of sometimes strong thunderstorms had formed near the Atlantic coasts, with instability becoming increasingly pronounced. These storms were quite windy with brief but strong gusts of wind. In the morning, the storms decreased slightly in intensity, but the instability was still present. The sky in La Rochelle, at dawn, was pre-stormy, with some breaks of blue sky to the west and distant lightning to the east. At 1 p.m., a few hours before the tornado formed, a new storm passed through Charente-Maritime. The electrical activity was relatively weak. In Bordeaux, Gironde, the radiosonde indicated moderate instability, with a convective available potential energy (CAPE) of 1,006 J/kg, as well as a lifting index (LI) of -5 K, which is quite significant. The jet stream was expected to reach 250 km/h. The relative helicity was measured at 535 m²/s² in the first three kilometers of altitude, and 208 m²/s² in the first kilometer, indicating a tornado risk. The temperatures at 2 meters were high in Bordeaux (27°C) but contrasted with those recorded in Blaye (18°C), for example. This strong thermal contrast is explained by the presence of a very active cold front between the two cities. The above radiosonde indicates the atmospheric conditions in Bordeaux at 2 p.m., just before the passage of the cold front. The radiosonde explains why a tornado had formed just south of the squall line. An additional warming of 1 or 2 K due to sunlight would have caused the lifting index (LI) to drop from -5 K to -7 K, which significantly increased the severity of the storms, even though the level of free convection varied little and the cumulonimbus clouds remained modest in thickness. The above radiosonde indicates that the top of the cumulonimbus was at about 300 hPa, or 9,000 m. The cumulonimbus was therefore not very thick. The photograph from the Keraunos site confirms this fact, showing that the cumulonimbus was not very spectacular."

                "content": "At 1:45 PM, radar images revealed a storm cell over the Bay of Biscay, heading towards the Charente coastline. Quite active, this storm was quickly organizing into a retrograde-propagating linear system. At 3:00 PM, the storm reached the Charente coastline, initially between Rochefort and La Tremblade. Still fairly well-organized, producing gusts locally reaching 70 km/h. However, electrical activity remained low. The line was moving along a southwest/northeast axis, still in retrograde propagation. The northern part of the storm line tended to weaken, while the southern part retained its wind potential. No rotation was yet observed. At 3:30 PM, the line weakened in the north, where the rain became stratiform. Convective energy persisted in the southern part of the line, where unstable cells were developing and moving along the squall, heading northeast. These rare storms were most often embedded in the rainy mass. At 3:45 PM, a new cell developed at the extreme south of the line, near Royan. This particular cell would become tornadic several minutes later. At 4:00 PM, this same storm became quite active, with hail potential. This cell began to exhibit a low-top supercellular behavior (in English, Low Top or mini-supercell). A wall cloud quickly formed at the base of this mini-supercell. A shelf cloud was also visible ahead of the storm line. At 4:10 PM, a funnel cloud, or tuba, formed at the base of the wall cloud, followed by some debris starting to swirl. The tornado had thus formed, gaining intensity. On precipitation radars, the rotation was clearly visible above Chaniers. At 4:45 PM, the tornado reached its maximum intensity as it traveled through the commune of Sonnac and its surroundings. It was in this area that it caused the most damage. At 5:10 PM, the tornado finally dissipated, as did the storm cell, which became just a weakening rain line over the following minutes."

The tornado started at Storrø fellesseter in Budal and ended on the eastern side of Forbygda in Singsås. This is a distance of approximately 20 km in a straight line. Eyewitnesses estimated that the tornado traveled from Storrø fellesseter over Svardal, Bakkløkkja, up through Bakkmarka, Buslettkjølen, and Svartåsen. A wide path of about 20–30 meters was visible where the forest was twisted and mowed down. The storm occurred in the afternoon. At the Langrødstrø farm in Singsås, all four buildings were destroyed by the storm. Adresseavisen wrote that it began to thicken around 4 PM. This is recounted in the journal Far tå folk 2016[1]. Half an hour later, hailstorms came, and shortly after, it got even worse. At Langrødstrø, three people were present. They had to escape the skewed house by crawling out through a window. A witness on the other side of the valley told Adresseavisen that the whirlwind was gray like a cloud and moved at great speed. All the roofs at Langrødstrø were peeled off. The tornado continued down through the valley, a bit up the river, crossed it, and moved toward the farms on the other side. However, in the steep ascent, the tornado lost much of its strength. Corrugated iron sheets, magazines, and clothes fell around the farms, 1 km from where the wind had picked them up. The tornado caused significant damage to forests and buildings during the short time it lasted. The hailstorms contained hailstones as large as plums, according to witness accounts reported in Far tå folk. No people were injured. The destruction at Langrødstrøa attracted great attention in both local and national media. NRK had a report on Dagsrevyen on July 12, the day after, and Adresseavisen, Arbeideravisa, and Aftenposten had front-page coverage with pictures the same day. Several articles followed in other newspapers in the days afterward. A fundraising campaign was initiated for those affected by the storm. Midtre Gauldal municipality also provided financial assistance.[1]"

It was a tornado of category F2/T4 (Fujita scale & TORRO scale) (T4 stands for maximum wind speeds between 185 and 220 kilometers per hour). Furthermore, it was a so-called multi-vortex tornado, which appeared very impressive due to the swirling dust. The approximately 5.4-kilometer-long path of the tornado averaged 120 meters in width but was up to 240 meters wide in some places. A 23-year-old man was hit by falling branches and had to be treated in the hospital. The roofs of some houses were partially uncovered by the storm. Some roads were temporarily blocked by fallen avenue trees or branches; the country road between Boisheim and Brüggen (L 373) was closed near Dilkrath for over a week."

After crossing the railway tracks in the northern part of the city, it continued across the entire city. In this section, damage was only recorded in the F0/T1 range; the tornado temporarily weakened in this area. The tornado regained strength as it reached the cemetery on the southwestern outskirts; at this point, it reached F1/T3 strength over a width of approximately 200 meters. Subsequently, the tornado turned south, maintaining a consistent width of around 190 meters up to the L3. When the tornado crossed the L3, a forested area was almost completely destroyed over at least 240 meters; at this point, the tornado reached F2/T4 intensity. After crossing the L3, the tornado moved southwest again, passing Heidend and Dilkrath, where it caused F0/T1 damage at the town entrance. The next 2.2 kilometers of the path ran over open fields without any known damage. The tornado caused its last damage at the town entrance of Amern, where it reached F1 status. The tornado likely dissipated a few meters further, as its trail disappears at this point."

According to analyses from the time, the tornado continues its path through the Clères forest, covering a total distance of about fifteen kilometers before dissipating in Grugny."

                "content": "The damage is considerable. Debris was found in Saint-Victor and Torcy-le-Grand, 30 km from Montville, which testifies to the destructive force of the phenomenon. In the woods belonging to Deputy Charles Levavasseur, two to three hundred beeches were uprooted. The three mills in the valley, which concentrated most of the industrial activity, ceased to exist. The human toll is the heaviest ever recorded in France for a tornado. Among the 200 to 370 mill workers who were at work at the time, very few were able to take shelter, especially since, due to its large diameter, the funnel encompassed most of the valley. Dozens of bodies and injured people, sometimes horribly mutilated, were extracted from the debris by nearby residents who came to help. The interior of the factories is described as \"a slaughterhouse of human flesh,\" according to the newspaper La Presse. Mr. Neveu himself was pulled alive from the rubble but was very shocked. He had protected his mother with his body, and she emerged unscathed. After three hours of prostration, he declared: \"I know I am ruined, but I do not complain; I had the happiness of saving my mother.\" An ambulance service was set up, and doctors arrived from Rouen. The director of the Cheval-Noir, a local hotel, made his establishment, linens, and furniture available to them. The priest of Montville and other clergymen attended to the injured, offering prayers and comfort. The families of the victims were sent away to allow the doctors to work under the best conditions, which led to scenes of despair. As the mutilated bodies of two young girls were removed from Picquot's house, their mother recognized them and, in her grief, threw herself into the river, where she drowned. The clearing work lasted until the next day. In total, 75 deaths were counted after the disaster. On August 21, Prefect Henri Dupont-Delporte and the field marshal visited the injured and assessed the damage. A subscription for the benefit of the victims and their families was opened at the Rouen town hall, and Mayor Henry Barbet posted an appeal for donations throughout the city. Charity performances were held: in Rouen itself on September 9 and in Paris, at the Circus, on the same day, then at the Théâtre des Variétés, which was packed on September 12. The Norman writer Eugène Noël witnessed the disaster and participated in the rescue efforts with Charles Michelet (the son of historian Jules Michelet), who was among the survivors. He had been walking in the woods at the time of the tornado's passage."

The tornado derailed some train cars of a train that had departed for Nova Gradiška at 4:17 PM. The rear car, weighing over 13 tons, was thrown 30 meters away, even crossing telegraph wires. The train carried about fifty passengers, three of whom were seriously injured, and one shepherd was killed. Based on the direction of overturned train cars and trees in the nearby forest, Mohorovičić concluded that the wind in that area was cyclonic and estimated its speed to be between 46 and 158 m/s. The tornado consisted of two vortices, meaning there were two tornadoes. The storm developed on the southeastern edge of a storm front moving northeast. The edge of this front coincided with low air pressure in the northern Bosnia and Herzegovina region. Temperatures were very high for that time of year, and there was a significant temperature difference between the coastal area and the interior. During the tornado, the temperature dropped by 10°C. According to today's classifications, this would be a T6 tornado, or a moderately destructive tornado. Lieutenant Kaudermat recounts the following: After the train left Dubica, I saw terrifying clouds in the direction of Sisak; the heat was unbearable, and the humidity was oppressive. After leaving Jasenovac, I saw a similar cloud to the southwest, like a huge semicircle, dark brown in color. The rest of the sky was relatively clear, covered with thinner clouds. Shortly before the train departed from Novska, I saw a long funnel descending from that dark mass toward the ground, precisely over the forest (Greda). The funnel was wide where it connected to the main cloud mass, narrowing toward the ground, and then widening again just above the ground. Within the funnel, very rapid rotation around its axis could be seen, moving to the left. In the aftermath of the damage, particularly in the export of massive quantities of fallen Slavonian oaks, new settlers arrived from across Austria-Hungary, including a large number of craftsmen who permanently settled in the Novska area."

Late in the afternoon of November 26, the tornado developed about 20 km southwest of Roodepoort. At 5:45 PM, it reached the town along with a heavy thunderstorm and caused millions of rands in damage in just five minutes in a strip 300 m wide and 3 km long. Lightning, pouring rain, and a severe hailstorm worsened the storm damage. The eye of the whirlwind moved northeast at 40 km per hour. All 15 times the funnel touched the ground, it caused great destruction: 700 houses were flattened, and power and railway lines were destroyed. A miracle was that no fires broke out. After an hour, it had almost dissipated 64 km from its starting point. Miraculously, only 4 people died in the town, and 70 were injured. Strangely enough, a much less powerful tornado also struck the town in February 1935, blowing roofs off houses, uprooting trees, and toppling telephone poles. South Africa, with its high occurrence of thunderstorms, is very fortunate not to be plagued by a large number of tornadoes. Tornadoes are actually rare in the country. In the Western Cape, a tornado is an unknown phenomenon. Yet Malmesbury was struck by one on September 29, 1905. Five people died, many were injured, houses and business buildings were destroyed, and the full river flowed through the buildings. The most devastating tornado South Africa has ever experienced was on January 18, 1999, when Mount Ayliff was struck, resulting in 25 deaths and 500 injuries. Other well-known tornadoes include the Ficksburg tornado and the Duduza tornado."

Among the affected municipalities, in addition to Sumaré, are Americana, Paulínia, Itatiba, Campinas, and Santa Bárbara D'Oeste. \n\nOn the morning of the following day, the city was still suffering from the consequences of the tornado. The electricity supply had not been fully restored, further compromising water distribution. Public telephones were not working during the morning, and communication services were seriously affected. \n\nOf the 150 displaced people, only four families have not yet been able to return to their homes, which were destroyed by the strong winds of up to 300 km/h. The mayor also said he is counting on private initiatives and donations of construction materials, as well as the provision of labor, to speed up the municipality's recovery efforts. \n\nThe tornado affected an area of 40 kilometers. The city of Sumaré was in its path and was the most affected. The wind twisted power transmission towers, unroofed industries and houses, and uprooted at least four thousand trees. \"For this type of damage to structures, such as breaking poles and bending transmission towers, the wind speed must have been approximately 300 km/h,\" assessed researcher Hilton Silveira from Unicamp."

Entering the province of Venice, the storm damaged more than 60 houses, with four injuries reported in Vigonovo, Tombelle, Caltana, and Fossò, followed by damage to 150 buildings in Camponogara (with four injuries) and 120 buildings in the Miranese area (particularly in Dogaletto and Giare di Mira), with nine more injuries. Reaching the \"Camping Fusina\" campsite, the tornado swept away over 2,000 trees, tents, and bungalows (causing one death and 14 injuries), continuing towards Venice, passing just south of the island of Giudecca. At 9:32 PM, the tornado severely hit the island of Le Grazie and its architectural complex, then uprooted trees and damaged roofs on the island of San Servolo. Upon reaching the San Marco Basin, between the Lido of Venice and Sant'Elena, the tornado struck the 400-ton motor vessel Aquileia (causing one injury) and only partially affected the motor vessel Altino. Shortly after, at 9:36 PM, motorboat 130 of line 2, operated by ACNIL (Municipal Company of Internal and Lagoon Navigation), while docking at Sant'Elena, was fully hit by the tornado, which lifted and submerged the 22-meter-long, 22-ton vessel, resulting in 21 deaths among the approximately 50 passengers. The entire island of Sant'Elena was devastated, with uprooted trees (one of which killed a person) and damaged buildings, including the Celli shipyard and the marina. Significant damage was also sustained by the \"Francesco Morosini\" Naval Military School and the Pier Luigi Penzo Stadium. After sweeping through the Lido of Venice, particularly the Venice-Lido \"Giovanni Nicelli\" airport (with extensive damage to light aircraft) and the church of San Nicolò, the tornado reached Punta Sabbioni, uprooting trees and damaging over 50 houses. Finally, at 9:42 PM, the tornado struck the Ca' Savio campsite, where it caused 12 deaths and 141 injuries among the 300 people present."

High-pressure areas therefore become unstable below a certain minimum radius \n\nRkrit\n\n, equivalent to a large curvature. The air can no longer flow in a fixed circular path but instead flows outward away from the high-pressure area. In the process, the high-pressure area partially dissolves until the pressure gradient is so weak that a stable path can be reached again. The critical curvature \n\nκkrit\n\nfollows from the quadratic equation for solving the force balance of the anticyclonic gradient wind. For the velocity, there is only a real solution as long as the value under the square root does not become negative. For the anticyclonic gradient wind, it states that because the pressure gradient \n\n∂p/∂n\n\nis always negative, negative values can occur under the square root. The minimum radius \n\nRkrit\n\nat which the term under the square root is just not negative is reached when solving for \n\nRkrit\n\nyields. For the critical curvature \n\nκkrit\n\n, it follows that because the Coriolis parameter increases with increasing geographic latitude, larger curvatures and thus smaller highs are possible toward the poles. The wind speeds around a high-pressure area cannot become arbitrarily large due to this limitation of the pressure gradient force. Very strong winds can therefore only occur around low-pressure areas."

                "content": "What happened in Bellano on Saturday, June 25? Around 2:00 PM, shortly after the start of the first regatta, a storm broke out: the Menaggino, a wind particularly feared by the people of Bellano, formed within a few minutes and strengthened to 50-60 knots, followed by a heavy hailstorm. No vessel was spared from the sudden storm: all the catamarans capsized with their crews clinging somehow to the hulls, the dinghies struggling, filled with water, searching for any missing persons; the firefighters were promptly alerted with all their available resources (including a helicopter), and all the emergency response forces in the lake area and the Dervio clubs assisted the CVB members in rescuing and securing all the crews. In the end, there was a lot of fear, some damage to sails and hulls, but no serious harm to people, all of whom were rescued.\n\nExcerpt from the 2005 Bellanasco Cup report [1] Upon reaching Lake Como, blocked by the Grigne massif, the Menaggino fans out, channeling longitudinally along the water's surface with powerful gusts (50-60 knots) that raise short and irregular waves, 1-1.5 meters high (phase lasting 20-25 minutes), often followed by hail (2-5 minutes) and a violent downpour (15-30 minutes), during which the wind's strength diminishes and ceases due to the water column. The Menaggino always causes the inevitable capsizing of all sailing boats, from the first gusts, within a radius of about ten kilometers from Menaggio (essentially the water surface facing Menaggio, Varenna, Bellano, and more generally affecting navigation between Lierna – where, as well as in the locality of Fiumelatte, the Menaggino undergoes a clockwise rotation of almost 180° that makes it turn back – to the south, up to Dervio, to the north). In its initial phase, the wind's strength is such that it can even overturn motorized dinghies that, with little weight at the bow, keep their bow into the wind. The water surface ceases to be agitated as soon as the downpour begins, and overall the bad weather lasts just under an hour. The area of Lake Como north of Menaggio is affected by wind from the north and bad weather resulting from the Menaggino to a greater extent than the area to the south (Bellagio area), which is affected by wind from the south, where the bad weather disperses into the two branches – mainly into the Lecco branch and only to a limited extent into the Como branch – and quickly diminishes in intensity as it moves away from the point where the Menaggino appeared on the water's surface."

                "content": "The expert navigators of Lake Como, especially the sailors, are accustomed to keeping an eye on the development of weather events occurring in the hinterland of Menaggio. From the moment a storm disturbance affecting the Val Menaggio in a west-east direction becomes visible from the lake, it takes about 10-15-20 minutes before it respectively reaches Varenna, Bellano, and Dervio, giving sailors the opportunity to prepare for the event. For sailboats near a landing (within 10-15 minutes), it is customary to head to shore and be hauled out, lowering the sails and storing them safely. For sailboats in the middle of the lake, it is advisable to escape the Menaggino as much as possible, moving away from Menaggio by taking advantage of the tailwind, traveling with it until the disturbance loses intensity and eventually passes the boat. However, if it is foreseeable that the force of the Menaggino will reach the vessel and cause it to capsize, it is best to remain in the center of the lake (away from the shores) and favor a 180° capsize (a 90° capsize, with the consequent sail effect of the hull, would cause a faster drift of the boat): the sail will produce an anchor effect reducing the drift, and at the same time, the overturned hull of the vessel will provide protection to the crew from any hail."

The recovery of the boats was completed at 8:00 PM. A seaplane was forced to make an emergency landing. Seven ambulances, one helicopter, firefighters, and civil protection intervened. \"It was one of the worst afternoons in recent years. Fortunately, we managed to bring everyone to safety.\" (Giuseppe Ortelli, President of the Bellano Sailing Club) Considering the meteorological data of the day, the Menaggino was preceded by a stormy disturbance passing from Lugano-Massagno around 1:30 PM with winds at 23 miles; by 1:50 PM, the wind in Lugano had already returned to a speed of 3 knots, with only the strongest gusts remaining at 23 knots; from 2:50 PM onwards (and for at least an hour), the wind in Lugano dropped, resulting in absolute calm."

The wind is stronger than the trade winds that normally blow here. Among other things, it leads to increased upwelling along the coast, bringing cold, nutrient-rich water in the Gulf of Tehuantepec on the Pacific coast. Tehuano is created by a wave of cooler, drier air from the North American continent. Such waves are more common in winter but can occur at other times of the year as well. This air is heavier than the tropical air mass normally found in the area, thus creating a strong pressure gradient that generates the wind. The wind is further intensified as it is channeled through the Chivela Pass between the Bay of Campeche and the Pacific coast. The same conditions are the cause of the Papagayo wind off the coast of Costa Rica and Panama further south."

As a result of the potential vorticity conservation theorem, a dynamic depression will form over the Gulf of Genoa, which will generate an easterly return over the Alps. Precipitation can be abundant on the ridge line. The cloud can thus be likened to a foehn wall that releases its precipitation on the ridge line. Downstream (to the west), precipitation will be less or nonexistent due to the foehn effect. A textbook case occurred on February 29, 2016. Guillaume Séchet had forecast bad weather across the entire southeast of France with burle, mistral, and lombarde on the Alpine border chain. A moderate mistral was blowing over Marseille, and the weather was clear. However, it was raining in Nice. The same was true in Cuneo. A deluge of snow indeed fell on the Queyras on February 29."

A Lombard storm had blown all morning on April 5, 1969, over Mont-Cenis, and snow began to fall there from 12:00. Snowfall started at 7:00 PM in Bonneval-sur-Arc and at 8:00 PM in Bessans. These snowfalls ceased on Easter Sunday. Substantial rain fell between Turin and Susa, where 50 mm to 60 mm of rain was recorded. In the village of Montcenis, 1.8 m of snow fell. On the western slope, precipitation decreased very quickly moving westward. Lanslevillard received 70 cm of snow, Lanslebourg 50 cm, and only 12 cm fell in Termignon. Val-d'Isère received 90 cm of snow, while Bourg-Saint-Maurice experienced a foehn effect and no precipitation occurred. The snow in Maurienne had an unusual structure. It was composed of well-formed crystals that tended to \"flow\" (graupel?) and was therefore not very prone to avalanches. However, an avalanche struck the village of Bonneval-sur-Arc and damaged a few houses. A resident attempted to jump from the balcony of his chalet into the 3-meter-high avalanche mass and found himself stuck in the snow, requiring the help of neighbors to extricate him from the predicament. On Easter Sunday, the entire southern half of France was subjected to a southeast flow due to a depression centered south of the Gulf of Lion."

In winter, it is more associated with sustained rain or snow with gusts that can exceed 100 km/h. The white Wind variant occurs when Switzerland is closer to the Mediterranean anticyclone. It is linked to a more pronounced local summer warming around the Petit-Lac than in the rest of the region and sunny weather. It causes small waves and makes the leaves move."

On average, the air temperature in Latvia ranged from +22 to +27 degrees. In Riga, the air temperature reached +25.1 degrees, but in Saldus even +27.0 degrees. It was very humid weather with high relative air humidity. Starting from the south, a cold atmospheric front crossed Latvia. When the hot and humid air met a cooler air mass, significant cumulonimbus rain clouds formed, bringing with them intense rain, locally heavy, thunderstorms, and hail. In some places, strong wind gusts were also observed. The first precipitation points began to form around 11:30 AM in the vicinity of Dobele, moving in an E direction, rapidly gaining strength, and by 2:00 PM, two active thunderstorm fronts had already formed. One stretched from Tērvete in the SW direction to the western regions of Lithuania, while the other was located in the vicinity of Baldone and Iecava. At the same time, to the N of Riga, near Tukums, by Smārde, a third thunderstorm zone actively began to form, which started moving in an E direction. At 3:00 PM, the first two thunderstorm zones merged and became increasingly stronger, covering the area from Lielvārde to Bauska and further to Šiauliai, while the next thunderstorm zone reached Riga from the west, passing over Jūrmala. Around 4:30 PM, all the strong precipitation zones had merged into one large zone, stretching from NE Vidzeme to the central regions of Lithuania. This zone continued its movement in an E, SE direction, bringing more or less heavy rain to the central regions of Latvia, as well as throughout Zemgale and partially also to the S and E of Vidzeme, as well as the W regions of Latgale, but less heavy rain fell throughout Latgale. Around 6:00 PM, another thunderstorm zone formed and moved across the central regions of Latvia, but it was not as strong and brought only a small thunderstorm and light rain to Riga, bringing heavier precipitation to the vicinity of Jelgava and further moving in a S, SE direction, entering Lithuanian territory, bypassing Bauska."

In some areas, shop signs and construction scaffolding were damaged, and temporary traffic light malfunctions were reported. Within an hour, the air temperature dropped from +26 to +18 degrees. After the heavy rain, water puddles were visible in the basement restroom areas of the Saeima building, while on the second floor near the Saeima session hall, water seeped through the glass ceilings. Meanwhile, a burst drainage pipe at the eight-story State Revenue Service (SRS) building in Riga, at 1 Jeruzalemes Street, flooded the fourth floor, which housed the Strategic Development Department led by Vladimir Vaškevič and the SRS Personnel Department archive. A weaker thunderstorm with light rain was also observed in Riga shortly after 7:00 PM."

Not only the lower streets, which usually form deep puddles after heavy rain, but also a large part of the central streets were flooded. In some places, the water level reached up to half a meter in depth. As a result of the heavy downpour, sewer covers were washed away in some parts of the city, such as at the intersections of Ģertrūdes Street and Valmieras Street, as well as Bauskas Street and Ziepniekkalna Street. During the heavy rain, protective barriers at construction sites were washed away in some places. Rainwater flowed into the basements and ground floors of buildings. Significant material damage was caused by rainwater entering basement stores, where goods were damaged and people's safety was endangered. Perhaps the most serious incident occurred on Tērbatas Street, in a shoe store, where water quickly flooded the store premises located in the basement, and a woman who had remained in the store was rescued by passersby. To address the consequences of the rain and wind in Riga, operational work was carried out by both street and traffic light maintenance companies. To clear the roads of water as quickly as possible, street maintenance companies performed additional water pumping in critical areas and cleaned rainwater drainage points of debris caused by the downpour. Roads were cleared of fallen tree branches. As a result of the rain and strong wind, a large tree branch fell onto the roadway on Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street near the Latvian National Theatre, causing traffic flow on Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street to be hindered. According to information from the Riga City Council Traffic Department's Traffic Management Center, traffic was most severely disrupted in Riga at the intersections of Krišjāņa Barona Street, Audēju Street, and Aspazijas Boulevard, as well as at the intersection of Matīsa Street and Tērbatas Street. Traffic was also hindered on Pētersalas Street, Krasta Street, Juglas Street under the Brīvības Street overpass, and elsewhere in the Vidzeme and Latgale suburbs. The movement of trams on routes 6 and 11 was disrupted because a high water level had accumulated on the tracks, preventing the trams from continuing their journey. Eyewitness accounts and photographs later published in photoblogs showed that on Matīsa Street, water puddles had formed so large that cars had to stop and turn around, while bicycles were submerged up to their wheels. The fire station on Matīsa Street was also reportedly flooded. In the western and northern neighborhoods of Riga, the rainfall was not as intense and prolonged as in the central part of the capital and the eastern neighborhoods of the city. For example, only 13 mm of precipitation was recorded at Riga Airport."

This was the strongest rainfall of the summer of 2009, according to information from the Latvian Environment, Geology, and Meteorology Agency, reported by the news agency BNS, and on this day, the highest air temperature was also recorded, reaching +30.7 °C in Jelgava."

Before the cold atmospheric front, the weather in many parts of Latvia was very hot and humid, with air temperatures close to +30 degrees, although it was quite windy. The highest air temperature among meteorological observation stations was recorded in Jelgava at +30.7°C and in Riga at +30.4°C. Already during the night, a cyclone approaching the Kurzeme coast brought very heavy rainfall to the Kurzeme coast, and the first heavy precipitation reached Liepāja and the southern coast of Kurzeme on July 18 at 11:00 PM. It moved northward and brought heavy rain to the entire Kurzeme coast, including Ventspils, where thunder rumbled and it rained frequently and heavily. During the night, 42 mm of rain fell in Liepāja, and 25 mm in Pāvilosta. Around 6 AM, a moderate and irregular precipitation zone approached Latvia from the south, stretching across the entire northern territory of Lithuania. This precipitation zone brought heavy rain to certain areas throughout Kurzeme, especially the southern part of Kurzeme, as well as the Baltic Sea coast and the western coast of the Gulf of Riga. The precipitation zone reached Riga around 10 AM, but it had already lost strength, so only moderate and short-term rain was observed in Riga and its surroundings. This precipitation zone also brought rain to the southeastern part of Zemgale. Between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM, it caused short-term downpours and moderate thunderstorms in many parts of Latgale. However, as the sun rose, the skies cleared over most of Latvia, and the air quickly began to warm, creating favorable conditions for the development of strong thunderstorms ahead of the cold atmospheric front. The second, strong precipitation zone first reached the southern regions of Kurzeme, where around 1:00 PM, a very heavy downpour occurred in Liepāja, flooding many city streets. Continuing to develop rapidly, the precipitation zone moved in a north-northeast direction and by 5:00 PM had already reached Talsi and was rapidly approaching Zemgale from Lithuania. Around 6:00 PM, the thunderstorm zone reached Riga and the southern regions of Latgale. As observed on the Doppler-type meteorological radar of the Latvian Environment, Geology, and Meteorology Center (LVĢMA), after 6:00 PM, this thunderstorm front stretched across almost the entire territory of Latvia, from Daugavpils to Kolka. Continuing its movement in a northeast direction, it left Latvia's territory towards Estonia and Russia shortly after 9:00 PM. Behind the front, widespread small rain clouds formed, which brought light rain to the now cooler territory of Latvia, continuing in some places until 11:30 PM. Later, separate precipitation zones with fairly heavy rain also formed in some parts of Latgale and Zemgale, but no thunderstorms or significant wind gusts were observed in these areas anymore."

Around 5:00 PM, small cumulus clouds began to appear, and by approximately 5:15 PM, dark cumulonimbus rain clouds appeared on the southern horizon, rapidly approaching. The strong wind began to subside, and a relative calm set in. By around 5:30 PM, the storm front had already reached Riga, and 10 minutes later, a very strong and gusty wind suddenly began, bending trees and carrying small branches and leaves through the air. The wind speed in the center of Riga reached 22 m/s, while at Riga Airport, strong wind gusts of 16 m/s were recorded. The air temperature dropped from +30 to +25 degrees within 5 minutes. At 5:50 PM, the strong wind gusts were suddenly joined by a very heavy downpour with strong hail and intense thunder. The heavy rain lasted for about 15 minutes, during which the wind gradually began to subside. When the downpour ceased, light rain, accompanied by occasional thunder, continued for about half an hour. After the storm began, the air temperature dropped rapidly.

Due to the cyclone, it rained heavily all day in Kurzeme, and the amount of rainfall in Liepāja almost reached the monthly norm. It was reported that the total rainfall at the ornithological station of the Pape Nature Park was 55 mm. Wind gusts in many places reached storm strength, breaking trees, large tree branches, and in some places completely or partially tearing off roofs of houses and causing other, smaller damages. Wind gusts in Rucava reached 26 m/s, in Saldus 23 m/s, in the center of Riga 22 m/s, while the meteorological observation station at Riga Airport recorded 16 m/s. However, in some places, the wind was likely slightly stronger (especially in parts of eastern Kurzeme and western Zemgale). As a result of the strong wind gusts, approximately 20,000 customers of the Latvian energy supply company \"Latvenergo\" were without electricity in the evening. The strong wind and thunderstorm left about 1,500 transformer substations across Latvia without power in the afternoon. Although power supply damages were recorded throughout Latvia, the strong wind caused the most damage in the areas of Saldus, Tukums, Talsi, Daugavpils, and Jelgava. In Riga, the strong wind and thunderstorm did not cause significant power supply disruptions. There were also observed disruptions in mobile phone and internet services. As informed by Andris Siksnis, head of the External Communications Department of \"Latvenergo,\" the next day, approximately 3,000 customers were still without power. The damages were repaired the fastest in the Western region, while in the Central region of Latvia — Riga district, Ogre district, and in the Southern region — Jelgava, Bauska, Dobele, Tukums, Talsi districts, and Engure parish, they were repaired later due to the larger extent of the damages. At the beginning of the thunderstorm, wind gusts in Riga carried not only street litter and flower vendors' buckets but also advertising posters and even temporary road signs in some places. In Riga, on Mūkusalas Street, in the section between the Railway Bridge and the Island Bridge, the wind broke a tree, disrupting trolleybus and bus traffic. Meanwhile, due to a large puddle, cars could pass this area with great difficulty. On Valmieras Street, the metal roof of a house was completely torn off and fell onto the street. In Riga's neighborhoods, trees and tree branches were broken. The heavy rain flooded certain street sections and lower areas in many places, but the rain was not as prolonged as during the thunderstorm on July 16, so prolonged flooding did not occur. Due to the thunderstorm, rescuers received ten times more calls than on a regular working day. In total, 124 calls were received, and State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD) employees participated in 104 rescue operations. Most calls due to wind-broken trees and torn-off roofs were in Riga and the Riga region."

On the night of July 18, a low-pressure trough with a very active occlusion front approached the western regions of Latvia, bringing heavy precipitation (63% of the monthly norm fell in Skulte and Dobele, while almost 60% fell in Riga), thunderstorms, and sharp wind gusts during the thunderstorm. During the day, the occlusion front continued to move eastward. Behind the front, the air temperature dropped sharply: in Bauska and Zīlāni by 10 degrees within an hour, in Skrīveri and Zosēni by 9, in Jelgava by 8, and in Riga by 7 degrees."

Reports of hail were received from all regions, including significant hail in the areas of Kuldīga, Saldus, Ventspils, and Sigulda, and hail was also observed in Riga. The heaviest and most widespread rainfalls affected the Kuldīga and Saldus districts, according to meteorological radar data from the Latvian Environment, Geology, and Meteorology Center. Rain and thunderstorms continued in the evening in some parts of Kurzeme and Vidzeme, as well as in the Daugavpils area. The last strong thunderstorm, which moved across the Daugavpils district, left Latvian territory in a southwesterly direction shortly after 1:00 a.m. on June 12. Due to the thunderstorms, several thousand \"Latvenergo\" customers experienced temporary power outages, according to the power outage map on the company's website. Information at 11:50 p.m. indicated that emergency outages were registered in the areas of 224 transformer points affecting 2,342 customers, with the highest number recorded in the Daugavpils district (880), Krāslava district (745), Līgatne district (294), as well as in the districts of Aglona, Mazsalaca, Ludza, Dobele, Jelgava, and Valka, with the number of outages being 75, 45, 38, 35, 31, and 30, respectively."

It was the fourth and final storm within ten days at the turn of July and August that raged in Finland. The damages caused by the Asta, Veera, Lahja, and Sylvi storms totaled 81.5 million euros. Sylvi storm's share of the damages was the second largest, amounting to 15.1 million euros. The storm claimed one fatality. The Sylvi storm was a powerful thunderstorm front that developed in the Baltics and arrived at the Gulf of Finland coast as a 100-kilometer-wide MCS system, advancing deep into the inland. The Finnish Meteorological Institute warned authorities about the approaching storm with a special DANGER bulletin, but it was ignored across the country. In addition to severe thunderstorms and wind gusts, the storm involved strong downbursts. The Sylvi storm toppled trees and tore off building roofs across wide areas in Uusimaa, Kymenlaakso, Häme, South Savo, Pirkanmaa, Satakunta, and Ostrobothnia. Additionally, power outages affected thousands of households. The downbursts caused the most destruction in Pori. At the Kirjurinluoto arena, the Sonisphere festival with over 40,000 attendees was underway when the downburst struck the concert venue. About 40 people sustained injuries of varying degrees, and one of the injured later died in the hospital."

The first storm in the early morning of August 8 (from 05:00 to 09:30) moved from Lithuania in a northwest direction, affecting large areas in Kurzeme, bringing heavy thunderstorms, intense rainfall, and gusty winds. Previously, this storm had ravaged Lithuania, resulting in the deaths of 4 people under falling trees and many others sustaining various injuries. The most severe damage in Lithuania occurred in the Kaunas, Alytus, and Varėna regions. The second storm (15:00–22:00) also moved across Kurzeme, bringing heavy rainfall throughout the region, particularly in the northern part of Kurzeme and around Liepāja. In Talsi, trees were broken, and roofs were torn off some buildings. The third and most destructive storm, between 16:00 and 19:10, came from Lithuania and moved across the easternmost parts of Zemgale, a large part of Latgale, and the central and eastern regions of Vidzeme. The storm then entered Estonia, became even stronger, and reached as far as central Finland, where 40 people were injured (2 seriously) at the heavy metal music festival \"Sonisphere 2010\" in the city of Pori. In Estonia, hurricane-strength wind gusts of 36.5 m/s were recorded at the Väike-Maarja meteorological station. The fourth storm, which was a combination of multiple storm zones, reached Latvia's far eastern territories from Belarus at 18:00 and, moving northward, crossed Latgale and the easternmost regions of Vidzeme, bringing heavy rain and thunderstorms. The storm system completely left Latvia's territory shortly after 1:00 at night."

In the afternoon, a thunderstorm cloud moved from south to north over Latgale and the eastern part of Latvia, which, by all accounts, was the most intense. However, later at the beginning of the night, another band of clouds passed over Latvian territory closer to the Russian border. Thunderstorms also affected Kurzeme. One of the largest recorded amounts of precipitation was in Rūjiena—23 millimeters, with heavy rain also in Stende and during the first half of the night in Kolka. In Rēzekne, 16 millimeters were recorded, which is also considered heavy rain. At 6:00 PM in Alūksne, large hail was recorded. Meanwhile, the strongest recorded wind was in Rūjiena around 9:00 PM—24 meters per second (m/s). In Stende, wind speeds reached 22 m/s. Meteorologists acknowledged that the center's meteorological stations do not capture all information, as, for example, in Daugavpils, the thunderstorm bypassed the station because the observation station is located a few kilometers outside the city, where the storm was not as severe. Similarly, information about Madona is limited for meteorologists. The storm that passed over the eastern part of Latvia affected large areas from the vicinity of Daugavpils to Valmiera and Alūksne. It tore roofs off houses, uprooted or broke trees, and even damaged high-voltage power lines, causing harm to people."

The storm also severely affected the surroundings of Līvāni. In the Rožupe parish, roofs were torn off some buildings, masonry walls were tilted, and trees were massively broken, blocking roads. In Strenči, a basketball camp was disrupted. The storm caused the most significant damage in Madona, Daugavpils, Preiļi, Viļāni, and other places, resulting in fallen trees, roofs torn off houses, and people left without electricity. The wind was accompanied by heavy rain and hail — eyewitnesses reported that hailstones were as large as plums. Approximately 33,000 Latvenergo customers were left without electricity. The storm also damaged three observation stations of the Latvian Environment, Geology, and Meteorology Center. Due to technical problems, data from Madona and Zosēni were not received, and the Daugavpils observation station only partially operated.

The damage is in hard-to-reach areas, delaying the restoration of power supply. The most damage by the afternoon of the next day was in the Daugavpils area, where 321 transformer substations and 7,335 customers were without power. In Preiļi, approximately 4,000 users were without electricity. In Madona, 4,791 users were without power, while in Gulbene, only 151 remained affected. In the Smiltene and Valka areas, the elimination of damage caused by the natural disaster and the restoration of electricity supply continued into the next day, with 6,940 customers still waiting, and approximately 4,000 households in the Valmiera and Rūjiena areas. In total, by the afternoon of August 9, 1,661 transformer substations were without power. As Madona municipality mayor Andrejs Ceļapīters suggested, electricity in rural areas of Madona municipality might only be restored by Tuesday evening, as \"Latvenergo is still unable to get out of Madona.\" Access to the power lines torn by trees is currently not possible.

The chairman of the Līvāni municipality council, Andris Vaivods, reported that people are in despair as many have nowhere to live—roofs have been torn off houses, in some farms only a pile of boards remains from barns, and crops, orchards, and forests have been devastated. Even the oldest residents do not recall such a storm. Century-old oaks were uprooted, falling branches crushed agricultural machinery and killed livestock. Fortunately, there were no human casualties in the storm, but many endured great fear, trapped in cars. Local residents, desperate over the destroyed buildings, massively sought help from the municipal government. The Līvāni municipality also committed to helping the residents. It was promised that timber for roof reconstruction would be provided to all whose homes were destroyed by the storm.

                "content": "The meteorologist Gustav Hellmann (1854–1939) published an article in the Meteorologische Zeitschrift about this, [1] which is partially reproduced here. Hellmann analyzed \"the extremely severe thunderstorm that broke out on Monday, April 14, around 3 a.m., lasted until 8:45 a.m., and was accompanied by such heavy rain as Berlin had never experienced before. (...) The rainfall began shortly after 3 a.m., was heavy until around 9 a.m., and continued with interruptions, but much weaker, until around 2 p.m. During this period of barely 11 hours, the following measurements were recorded: The differences in rainfall are greatest in the direction from W to E. At the eastern edge of the city, the amount is 10–20 mm, only 4 mm at a distance of 7 km, and east of a line running approximately in the direction of Jüterbog – Zossen – Wriezen, i.e., only 28 km east of Berlin, there was no rain at all. The area of maximum rainfall, with approximately 150–170 mm, lies in the northwestern part of the inner city and is probably no larger than half a square kilometer. But even to the west, the decrease in rainfall is significant; only 11 km west of the maximum area, in Ruhleben near Spandau, only 29 mm were measured. The differences are, of course, smallest in the direction from NNE to SSW, in which the storm progressed. (...) The course of the cloudburst in Berlin itself is more closely documented by the records of some pluviographs at the municipal pumping stations (...). (...) The rainfall seems (...) to have been most intense between 5 and 6 a.m. Shortly after 6 a.m. (noted as 6:10 to 6:16 a.m.), heavy hail also fell in part of the inner city, lasting until around 6:40 a.m. It was washed away by the streams of water that had formed on the streets to lower-lying areas and into houses, where it remained until around noon, and in some places until the next day, and had to be removed in dozens of buckets. This hail certainly contributed, through the clogging of pipes, etc., to the fact that the enormous masses of water drained more slowly and the damage caused by them, which can be estimated at many hundreds of thousands of marks, was even greater than it would have been with just rainfall. Street traffic was significantly disrupted in the morning, and even school lessons had to be canceled, which had probably never happened in Berlin before.\" It should be noted that the article refers to the then city area of Berlin, which, until the expansion in 1920, only included today's immediate center. A city climate study from 1990 leaves open whether similarly high amounts of rainfall as in Pankow and Wedding fell in the higher areas of Wilmersdorf-Schöneberg-Tempelhof, which were not recorded due to a lack of measuring stations. [3] Hermann Stade (1867–1932) [4] published a study on the storm, [5] in which the evening edition of the Staatsbürger-Zeitung from April 14, 1902, is quoted (noted after the scan): \"Around 2 a.m. (April 14), the thunderstorm approached the imperial capital from the northeast, initially only with lightning and thunder phenomena. Around 2:30 a.m., light rain began, followed by a violent hailstorm in some places around 3 a.m. At 3:45 a.m., particularly in the southwest, west, and center, such masses of ice fell that roadways and sidewalks were covered up to 10 cm high ... Finally, at 4:30 a.m., torrential rain began, initially affecting the north in particular. Within a few minutes, almost the entire Gesundbrunnen was under water, and the distressed residents of basement rooms were often unable to save their furniture. In three cases, firefighters had to rescue children floating in beds or cradles from their dangerous situation. And now the floodwaters spread over all parts of Berlin. Although all machines at all pumping stations were put into operation, hundreds of millions of liters of water were transported to the sewage fields, and all emergency outlets discharged enormous amounts of water into the Spree, the floods gushed fountain-like from the canals onto the streets.\" Stade himself writes: \"Many streets and squares in Berlin were subsequently flooded for 3 (8?) hours and resembled large lakes. In the lower-lying parts of the city, such as Yorckstraße, the water level exceeded 1/2 (?) meter in the morning hours of April 14, but even in the higher-lying areas of the north and northeast, the water rose to nearly 1/2 (?) meter, so that the residents there were confined to their houses for hours. In many places, the pavement was torn up, and large amounts of washed-away sand clogged the access to the drainage canals; the same problem was caused in many places by the enormous masses of hail that were carried along by the water flowing down the streets. Extensive, long-lasting floods were the result. In several cases, houses collapsed due to the undermining of their foundations, and on the Northern Railway, a dam collapse occurred, which not only led to a multi-day interruption of rail traffic but also caused nearby houses to either collapse or become so severely endangered that they had to be evacuated. Numerous lightning strikes were reported from all parts of the city, particularly from the north. In many places, the support masts of the tramway were struck by lightning, and in several cases, the power supply points burned out. This, as well as the collapse of some support masts undermined by water, caused a disruption in Berlin's tram traffic of an extent that had never been seen before; not a single tram line was able to maintain uninterrupted operation.\""

                "content": "Since 1902, only \"traditional\" weather observations near the ground were conducted, making the retrospective analysis of the weather situation uncertain. \"Unfortunately, during this time, the kite stations now existing in Germany were not yet operational; therefore, there is no insight into the air pressure and temperature distribution of the upper air layers, which, of course, were actually decisive for the direction of the thunderstorms' progression.\" Neither H. Stade's investigation nor the synoptic archive of the Weather Center provide clear conclusions about the causes of the disaster. One possible interpretation is warm air flowing in near the ground, destabilized by an upper trough. Small air pressure differences at higher altitudes may have been the reason why the thunderstorm cells moved so slowly and lingered over the city for a long time. Unusual in this context is the direction of movement from northeast to southwest mentioned by Hellmann and supported by the synoptic archive of the \"Weather Center,\" which suggests an \"easterly\" or \"warm air intrusion thunderstorm.\" This type of thunderstorm is rare (according to H. Stade's investigation, Berlin meteorologists were surprised by its development) and only occurs at quasi-stationary warm fronts that move so slowly that wave formations become possible. Stade's note that several thunderstorm cells may have been present in and over the city also points in this direction. Thunderstorms of this type are often characterized by particular intensity. Additionally, nocturnal destabilization due to radiation at the cloud tops and the enhancement of precipitation activity by the \"urban effect\" may have had an amplifying effect. In Berlin's climatological records, only a precipitation value of 67.4 mm is recorded for April 14, 1902, corresponding to the amount measured at 7 a.m. at the climate station then located in Kreuzberg, without considering the individual sums measured at other Berlin precipitation stations. From 1848 (the beginning of observations by the Prussian Meteorological Institute) to 1983, daily precipitation totals of 100 mm were exceeded in Berlin on only two other days. Even Reinhard Süring cites the 1902 cloudburst as a Berlin record in his meteorology textbook. The precipitation amount of 166 mm was only surpassed in Berlin's urban area on August 15/16, 1959, during the so-called Riemeisterfenn rain, when 210 mm fell within 30 hours. On June 29, 2017, a record value for 24-hour precipitation in the state of Berlin was registered with 215.8 mm at the Tegel Forestry Office (a station of the urban measurement network of the Institute of Meteorology at the Free University of Berlin). However, the highest precipitation intensity within the city area is considered to be the 123.4 mm that fell at Berlin-Tegel Airport on the evening of August 25, 2006, within just 75 minutes. Previously, the so-called Siebenschläfer storm of 1964, with 80.8 mm in 2 hours measured at Berlin-Tempelhof Airport, had held the intensity record for 42 years. In Brandenburg, the highest daily precipitation total to date was measured on June 12, 1993, with 255.8 mm in Pritzwalk, while the strongest precipitation intensity occurred on June 29, 1994, when five severe hailstorms passed through Werder (Havel), dropping 176.7 mm within just 3 1/2 hours."

The gymnasium was located at Friedrichstraße 126. \"On Monday, April 14, classes had to be suspended due to a severe storm that broke over Berlin in the morning.\" \"Classes were canceled on April 14 due to the major storm, which flooded the courtyards and cellars of the school property.\" The isolated nature of the thunderstorm is indicated by the measured precipitation total of the nearby Potsdam weather station, which was \"only\" 26.5 mm, and the observation of the pastor and writer Heinrich Wolfgang Seidel, who was serving as a vicar in the town of Boitzenburg, about 80 km to the north, and regularly wrote letters from there, which were published in book form in 1951. On April 14, 1902, the mail coach from Berlin arrived in Boitzenburg many hours late \"and brought terrible news about the Berlin cloudburst. Here, it had been such a lovely, radiant spring day with warm winds and birdsong that we were completely surprised.\""

                "content": "Typhoon No. 18, which occurred on September 7, made landfall in the Tokai region on September 9 and later became an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan that night. Although the direct damage caused by this typhoon was not significant, warm, moist air flowed in from the Pacific Ocean due to the extratropical cyclone that had transformed from the typhoon moving northeast over the Sea of Japan. This collided with moist winds blowing from Typhoon No. 17, which was approaching the Japanese archipelago from the sea east of Japan, resulting in the continuous formation of rain clouds (linear precipitation bands) stretching north to south. This caused heavy rainfall exceeding 300 mm in 24 hours, primarily in northern Kanto and southern Tohoku, leading to large-scale damage.\n\nOn September 9, heavy rain centered in northern Kanto occurred. According to AMeDAS observation data from midnight on September 7 to 5 p.m. on September 10, 24-hour rainfall by the morning of the 10th reached 551.0 mm in Nikko City’s Ikari and 541.0 mm in Nikko City’s Imaichi, with over 300 mm observed in various locations in Tochigi Prefecture. Additionally, total rainfall during the period was 645.5 mm in Imaichi, 622.0 mm in Ikari, 561.5 mm in Tōrobu, and 523.0 mm in Kanuma, with over 400 mm observed in various locations in Tochigi Prefecture. At 12:20 a.m. on September 10, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rain warning for the entire Tochigi Prefecture, and at 7:45 a.m., a similar warning was issued for almost all of Ibaraki Prefecture. In these regions, maximum caution was urged against river flooding, landslides, and inundation of low-lying areas, while surrounding prefectures were also called upon to exercise strict caution.\n\nThe area of rainfall gradually shifted to the Tohoku region, and at 3:20 a.m. on September 11, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rain warning for Miyagi Prefecture. The special heavy rain warnings issued for each prefecture were lifted at 6 a.m. on the 11th for Tochigi Prefecture, at 8:15 a.m. the same day for Ibaraki Prefecture, and at 7:30 p.m. for Miyagi Prefecture. On September 18, the Japan Meteorological Agency named the heavy rain and the resulting disaster that struck the Kanto and Tohoku regions as the \"September 2015 Kanto-Tohoku Heavy Rain.\" Additionally, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan set up a special page on its official website titled \"September 2015 Kanto-Tohoku Heavy Rain,\" providing information on the disaster using data such as topographic maps and aerial photographs.\n\nOn October 6, the government decided in a cabinet meeting to designate the agricultural damage caused by the disaster as a \"severe disaster\" under the Act on Special Financial Assistance for Severe Disasters, and to designate specific areas in Minamiaizu Town, Minamiaizu District, and Showa Village, Onuma District, in Fukushima Prefecture as \"localized severe disaster areas.\" This decision was promulgated and enforced on October 7. As a result, the proportion of government subsidies for municipalities conducting restoration work on farmland and agricultural facilities was raised to a maximum of approximately 90%.\n\nThe heavy rain in Tochigi Prefecture and flooding in Ibaraki Prefecture were compared to Typhoon No. 4 in 1998. While Typhoon No. 4 in 1998 recorded torrential rain and over 1,000 mm of precipitation, the Kanto-Tohoku heavy rain had a total rainfall of about 600 mm, with hourly rainfall of 50–70 mm (no record-breaking short-term heavy rain information was issued during the period)."

Additionally, there were 82 injured nationwide, 81 houses completely destroyed, 7,090 partially destroyed, 384 partially damaged, 2,523 flooded above floor level, 13,259 flooded below floor level, and 1,722 non-residential buildings damaged. It was also confirmed that breaches, overtopping, leaks, flooding, and damage or collapse of embankment slopes occurred in 5 rivers under national management and 80 rivers under prefectural management. According to the tally announced at 5:00 PM on September 13, evacuation orders were issued to approximately 240,000 people in 1 metropolitan area and 19 prefectures from Iwate Prefecture to Kagawa Prefecture since the 8th, and evacuation advisories were issued to approximately 3.15 million people.

As a result, a wide area of Joso City, located between the Kinugawa and Kokaigawa Rivers, was submerged, causing significant damage, including two direct fatalities, 12 disaster-related deaths, and over 40 injuries. Additionally, the Joso City Hall main building, which had just been completed in 2014 incorporating lessons from the Great East Japan Earthquake, was flooded, and more than 5,000 houses were partially or completely destroyed. In response to this incident, Joso City established a verification committee and compiled a report. \n\nFurthermore, at Tokyo Electric Power's Kinugawa Power Plant (Nikko City), Doyahara Power Plant (Shioya Town), and Akagawa Power Plant (Nasushiobara City), generators were submerged, and facilities were damaged, leading to a halt in power generation. Additionally, a landslide caused a transmission tower to tilt and break, cutting off power supply to the Yagan Railway Aizu Kinugawa Line, resulting in the suspension of operations on that line. Moreover, at Kinugawa Onsen in Nikko City, Tochigi Prefecture, an open-air bath of a hotel facing the Kinugawa River collapsed.\n\nTochigi City Riheya Elementary School and Oyama City Hanakawa Nishi Elementary School in Tochigi Prefecture announced plans to resume classes by borrowing vacant classrooms from other schools after their school buildings and gymnasiums were submerged by the flood. The second semester closing ceremony was held in hallways and music rooms as the gymnasium was under renovation and unavailable. In March 2016, the renovation of Hanakawa Nishi Elementary School's gymnasium was completed, and a restoration ceremony was held on March 9.\n\nAt Oyama Driving School, facilities and vehicles were severely damaged, with 14 out of 18 vehicles submerged, leading to a suspension of operations.

Areas such as Yunlin, Chiayi, Nantou, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung experienced widespread flooding, with some localized areas remaining flooded for nearly a week. It was the most severe and prolonged catastrophic heavy rain to affect Taiwan since the Typhoon Morakot disaster.

On the same day, Kaohsiung City also recorded over 300 millimeters of daily rainfall. The intense rainfall caused slippery roads in many areas, leading to multiple traffic accidents. In Xinyuan Township, Pingtung County, a car crashed into a utility pole, resulting in one death and three injuries. In Zhuqi Township, Chiayi County, a small car collision, possibly due to slippery roads and poor visibility caused by the rain, resulted in one death and one serious injury. On the 26th, the Pingtung County Police Department reported that a 64-year-old man who went to Haishen Temple in Sandimen Township was found missing after his car door was discovered open and the right rear wheel stuck in the riverbed, marking the first missing person case in this heavy rain event.\n\nThis heavy rain event also affected provincial highways. At the 260-kilometer mark of the Taiwan Route 17 in Qianzai Kou, water accumulation exceeded 20 centimeters and stretched over 100 meters. The Third Engineering Office of the Directorate General of Highways implemented road closures on the morning of the 26th. According to the Pingtung County Disaster Response Center, the Wutan section of Ping 106 in Taiwu Township was preemptively closed due to landslide risks. On the 1-kilometer mark of Route 200A in Manzhou Township, landslides obstructed road drainage, leading to controlled traffic. Additionally, the drainage system on the Fangliao section of Taiwan Route 1 was overwhelmed, causing approximately 20 centimeters of water accumulation on the road."

At the same time, it also became one of the counties and cities in the 2018 Republic of China local public office elections to stop accepting candidate registrations. This move raised questions from netizens about the standards for declaring holidays in Pingtung County. Pingtung County Government Personnel Office Director Li Yin-ming emphasized that the weather forecast had reached the standard for suspending work and classes, and noted that the top ten rainfall amounts on that day were all within Pingtung County. On the evening of the 27th, the Pingtung County Government stated that a landslide occurred in Shiwen Village and a collapse on County Road 146, causing traffic disruptions. Therefore, on the 28th, only Shiwen Village in Chunri Township, Pingtung County, suspended work and classes. The following day, heavy rain continued to fall in Pingtung County, with daily rainfall in several towns exceeding 200 millimeters. Severe traffic congestion occurred on the Linluo section of Provincial Highway 1 due to water accumulation, and flooding was reported on Guangfu Road near Pingtung Station and Fuxing South Road in Pingtung City, leading residents to question the county government's decision-making. Pingtung residents pointed out that the rainfall in Pingtung was no less than that in Kaohsiung, yet Pingtung County had normal work and classes on the 28th. They further stated that the Pingtung County Government should prioritize public safety. Pingtung County Government spokesperson Huang Jian-jia apologized in the afternoon, explaining that the rain was concentrated in a few towns and that there was no widespread flooding in the early morning."

Acting Mayor Hsu Li-ming urgently announced at 6 a.m. on the 28th that work and classes would be suspended that day, prompting public outrage with comments such as \"You announce it after we've already left home\" and \"Can I call for a boat on Uber?\" This led to widespread dissatisfaction among the public. In response, Hsu Li-ming apologized on Facebook, while his staff noted that he had stayed up all night monitoring the flooding situation."

                "content": "On August 24, while the entire nation was busy with disaster relief, Vice President of the Republic of China, Chen Chien-jen, took his whole family to Kinmen for a three-day, two-night vacation, visiting major attractions in both Greater and Lesser Kinmen. He was accompanied by twelve bodyguards, and nearly twenty plainclothes police officers from the Kinmen County Police Bureau were deployed for full-time protection. This incident caused public criticism and negative perception, with Kinmen County legislator Yang Cheng-wu blasting, \"He doesn't come when he should, but comes when he shouldn't.\" Presidential Office spokesperson Alex Huang stated that as a member of the government team, Vice President Chen deeply regrets causing negative public perception and criticism of the team, and he extends his apologies to the public. This incident was compared by the public to the actions of former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who took time for a haircut before the 2009 Typhoon Morakot disaster, and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Hsueh Hsiang-chuan, who had sweet potato porridge with his father-in-law after working overtime, both of whom were criticized by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) until they stepped down, creating a stark contrast.\n\nOn August 25, 2018, President Tsai Ing-wen of the Republic of China, accompanied by Chiayi County Magistrate Helen Chang, rode a Clouded Leopard armored vehicle to inspect Budai Township. Smiling, she encouraged disaster victims to stay strong. However, after the vehicle had only moved about 50 meters, it was stopped by local residents who angrily shouted, \"If you drive further, just run me over!\" Kuomintang (KMT) spokesperson Hung Meng-kai harshly criticized the incident on Facebook as \"the most arrogant disaster inspection in history,\" likening Tsai Ing-wen to a \"beauty queen on a parade float.\" Citizens also vented their anger on Facebook, saying, \"Disaster inspection? You won't even step into the water for show, and you come in an armored vehicle? At least pretend to be solemn or reflective! Smiling? Waving? Are you here to thank voters or campaign? Are you sure you're not in the wrong place?\" Many public figures criticized the incident, with Chu Hsueh-heng condemning Tsai Ing-wen for smiling and waving from multiple angles and at different times, saying, \"Her smile sends chills down your spine.\" Chu remarked that Tsai used to hold others to strict standards, but now that she is being judged by the same standards, it's only fair. \"If karma strikes, let it strike. Is it so hard not to have double standards?\" Hu You-wei commented that the incident occurred in Yong'an Village, symbolizing that Tsai can no longer \"be at peace forever.\" He humorously expressed Tsai's sentiments, saying, \"Whoever came up with the bad idea of having the president inspect disaster areas in an armored vehicle, send them to the Ministry of Justice for 80 lashes and then to the labor camp to clean toilets.\" Chang San-cheng pointed out, \"The people feel no empathy from the government. They've been soaking in water for days and hope high-ranking officials can understand their pain, but instead, they see President Tsai riding 'high and mighty' in an armored vehicle!\" He criticized Tsai for failing to \"share the people's suffering\" and lamented, \"With a president like this, I truly feel sorrow for our country.\"\n\nChiu Yi-ying criticized KMT Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Han Kuo-yu for attending a campaign song release event for a city council candidate, saying, \"Kaohsiung doesn't need a mayoral candidate like this!\" Subsequently, on August 26, Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker Tsai Chi-chang led legislators Lee Chun-yi, Ho Hsin-chun, Chiu Yi-ying, Lin Ching-yi, Lee Li-fen, Chou Chun-mi, and Chang Liao Wan-chien on a visit to Poland's parliament. This sparked controversy, as some questioned the appropriateness of the trip while flood disaster relief in affected areas was still incomplete.\n\nOn August 28, 2018, Legislative Yuan Speaker Su Jia-chyuan was spotted in Japan by the public, leading to suspicions that he was on vacation. Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia clarified that Su was visiting Japan at the invitation of the Japanese government, accompanied by his wife. However, due to concerns about Taiwan's disaster situation, Su returned to Taiwan early that day."

                "content": "Due to the approach of Typhoon No. 16, the activity of the stationary front lingering along the southern coast of Honshu became active around October 4. Additionally, a low-pressure system that formed on the front off the coast of Shikoku at noon on the 5th rapidly developed as it moved along the southern coast of Honshu on the 6th, further intensifying as it advanced to the Sanriku offshore area on the 7th and the eastern seas of Hokkaido on the 8th.  \n\nAs this rapidly developing low-pressure system moved north along the Pacific coast of Honshu, violent winds with maximum speeds exceeding 25 m/s occurred on the Pacific side from the Kanto region to Hokkaido. In Onagawa Town, Enoshima, Miyagi Prefecture, a record-breaking maximum wind speed of 30 m/s was observed at 7:30 a.m. on the 7th, and the seas experienced fierce waves exceeding 9 meters.  \n\nAdditionally, heavy rainfall exceeding 250 mm in total was recorded on the Pacific side of the Kinki, Kanto, and Tohoku regions, as well as the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido. Particularly in parts of the Abashiri Subprefecture in Hokkaido, the total rainfall exceeded four times the average monthly rainfall for October.  \n\nThis storm caused significant damage, including 1 death, 43 injuries, 1 completely destroyed house, 18 partially destroyed houses, 978 houses with partial damage, 293 houses flooded above floor level, and 1,004 houses flooded below floor level. Landslides included 1 debris flow, 2 landslips, and 34 slope failures.  \n\nRegarding rivers, 8 rivers in 8 water systems, including the Abashiri River, exceeded the flood danger level, while 20 rivers in 15 water systems exceeded the flood warning level, resulting in flooding and other damages in various areas.  \n\nIn terms of lifelines, approximately 150,000 households experienced power outages in the Hokkaido and Tohoku Electric Power service areas, and 8,056 households faced water supply disruptions in Hokkaido and other areas.  \n\nFor roads, traffic restrictions were implemented on 448 sections, including expressways, national highways, prefectural roads, and toll roads. Railways experienced service suspensions nationwide due to rainfall regulations and other factors. In aviation, 78 flights were unable to land at Narita International Airport (the highest number since its opening).  \n\nPublic civil engineering facilities suffered damage at 1,378 river locations, 124 coastal areas, 11 erosion control facilities, 603 road locations (including bridges), 30 ports, and 5 parks.  \n\nIn the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sectors, damage occurred at 940 farmland locations, 1,171 agricultural facilities, 222 forest degradation sites, 722 forest road facilities, 6,971 hectares of forest, and 155 fishing port facilities.  \n\nFurthermore, due to this low-pressure system, numerous ship groundings and capsizings occurred at sea, resulting in 19 deaths and 14 missing persons from maritime accidents. Additionally, the cold air flowing in behind the low-pressure system caused mountain accidents in Nagano and Gifu Prefectures.  \n\nCoastal areas such as Ibaraki Prefecture experienced storm surges. Subsequent investigations revealed that an unusual storm surge caused by Ekman transport associated with the low-pressure system had occurred."

The floodwaters initially destroyed the wooden dormitory houses in the district and deposited the debris in the yard of building 26, with the water level reaching the third floor of the building, resulting in the drowning of one resident[1]. Due to the overflow of the Lalvar stream, the buildings of riverside warehouses and first-floor shops were destroyed, and the goods inside were carried into the Debed River[1]. The overflow of the Debed River damaged the Yerevan-Tbilisi railway and highway, making transportation impossible. The hospital, court, and other state institutions, as well as the school, kindergarten, and residential buildings, were damaged. Floodwaters entered the first floors of buildings, sweeping away the belongings inside. After the flood, layers of mud 1 to 3 meters thick formed on the city's streets. The city park, roads, and private houses were destroyed, and landslides and collapses occurred. Animal casualties were recorded[1]. As a result of the disaster, the Hagpat and Sanahin stations suffered significant damage, and the water supply, sewage, electricity, gas supply, and communication networks were destroyed. The operations of some workshops of the metallurgical plant and the Alaverdi bread factory were halted. Floodwaters also entered the brewery's power substation, and the water swept away barrels filled with beer and bottles of lemonade[1]."
