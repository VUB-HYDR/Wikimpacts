The areas with the heaviest rainfall were in the southern mountainous regions. The accumulated rainfall from this heavy rain event was second only to the 2009 Typhoon Morakot disaster.

On August 5, the Central Weather Bureau stated that due to Lupit making landfall along the Guangdong coast of mainland China, its intensity slightly weakened, and its storm circle showed signs of shrinking. As a result, the typhoon warning was lifted at 5:30 PM. During the warning period, the Central Disaster Response Center was activated at Level 2, and a price stabilization mechanism for daily necessities was implemented. \n\nOn the evening of August 5, meteorological data showed that Lupit's outer circulation brought southwesterly moisture, causing significant wind and rain in the outlying islands and southern Taiwan. The Central Weather Bureau indicated that Lupit, downgraded to a tropical depression, would bring southwesterly airflow to western Taiwan as it moved northeastward. Peng Qiming, General Manager of Weather Risk Management Development Co., noted that Lupit had a well-structured moisture system extending 800 kilometers, with strong convection in the center accompanied by lightning. Central Weather Bureau Director Cheng Ming-dian also pointed out that the airflow axis was over the Taiwan Strait but had already significantly impacted Taiwan's western coastal areas.\n\nSubsequently, at 10 AM on August 6, the Central Weather Bureau issued a tropical depression advisory for Lupit, which was located 70 kilometers west of Kinmen and moving northeastward at a speed of 7 kilometers per hour. Later that afternoon, President Tsai Ing-wen announced that the central government planned to further activate the \"Flood Disaster Central Disaster Response Center\" that evening. The Central Weather Bureau stated that Lupit might strengthen again after moving into the northern waters of Taiwan, leaving open the possibility of reissuing a typhoon warning. At 5:30 PM that day, the bureau initiated \"large-scale or severe heavy rain operations.\"\n\nUltimately, during Lupit's impact on Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau recorded a maximum wind speed of only 15 meters per second in Penghu, and no weather station on Taiwan's main island reached the wind speed threshold. Scientifically, this was insufficient to classify it as a tropical storm, and the bureau maintained its classification as a tropical depression. After Lupit moved out to sea near Taiwan's northeastern coast, the Central Weather Bureau reported that it had re-strengthened into a tropical storm. At a forecast press conference, the bureau also stated that the combined effects of Lupit and the southwesterly airflow brought abundant moisture to Taiwan, warning all regions to be vigilant against disaster-causing rainfall."

On the afternoon of the 5th at 3:30 PM, the Council of Agriculture issued a heavy rain and landslide warning, indicating that 60 potential landslide streams were under red alert, 94 under yellow alert, with 1 large-scale landslide area under red alert and another under yellow alert [19]. On the same day, the Coast Guard evacuated 539 people, 213 vehicles, and 19 boats from the shore [20]. Due to the influence of Lupit's outer circulation and the southwest airflow, Uni Air and Mandarin Airlines announced on the 6th that domestic flights for the following day would be adjusted, with several island flights canceled or rescheduled [21]. \n\nIn the early hours of the 7th, a squall line from Lupit and the southwest airflow began moving from the Taiwan Strait toward Taiwan's mainland [22]. Lupit's center made landfall in the Hsinchu and Taoyuan areas on the morning of the 7th [23], marking the first recorded instance in meteorological history of a tropical cyclone making landfall in mainland China and then in Taiwan [24]. Heavy rainfall in Taiwan persisted, causing disruptions to the Taiwan Railway, where fallen trees between Houli and Fengyuan blocked the tracks, halting services from 6:30 AM until resuming at 9:12 AM [25]. Taiwan High-Speed Rail also suspended operations between Miaoli and Taichung from 12 PM due to a landslide in the Tongxiao section at 8:07 AM [26][27]. Taiwan Power Company reported that some power poles and lines were crushed by landslides and road collapses, with cables washed away by floods, resulting in power outages for approximately 93,066 households [28]. In Dahu Township, Miaoli County, a landfill was destroyed, burying 2 recycling trucks and 4 garbage trucks [29]. In Fengshan District, Kaohsiung City, an abandoned house on Guangyuan Road collapsed after being struck by lightning. The Kaohsiung City Public Works Bureau's illegal construction handling team promptly demolished the collapsed structure [30]. In Liugui District, a landslide entered a residential house, prompting the Fourth Combat Zone of the Republic of China Armed Forces to assist with post-disaster recovery, including clearing mud and debris and cleaning the environment [31]. In Taitung City, Taitung County, the \"Beinan River Water Cover Area\" dust prevention measure was completely destroyed by rising river water. After inspecting and assessing the Zhonghua Bridge over the Beinan River, multiple excavators were immediately deployed for emergency repairs [32]. \n\nThe Directorate General of Highways of the Ministry of Transportation reported at 12 PM on the 7th that road disasters included 9 preemptive closures, 10 blocked sections, and 9 damaged sections [33]. The main road disasters occurred on Provincial Highway 27, with multiple landslides causing interruptions [34]. On Provincial Highway 8, the Central Cross-Island Highway experienced fallen trees and scattered rocks [35]. The most severe damage was on Provincial Highway 20, where the Mingba Kelu Bridge in Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung City, was washed away [36]. The section near Shengjing Bridge to Taoyuan No. 1 Bridge was also impassable due to landslides, and a road collapse occurred at the 68-kilometer mark from Laonong to Jiaxian [37]. In the mountainous areas of Miaoli County, continuous heavy rain caused landslides, with a small truck in Zhuolan Township on Provincial Highway 3 struck by falling rocks [38]. In Chiayi County, 21 people were stranded for six days due to a road collapse on the access road to the Alishan Youth Activity Center [39]. \n\nThe outer circulation of Lupit and the southwest airflow led to the evacuation of 302 people in Majia Township, Pingtung County [40], and 152 people in Laiyi Township [41]. In Kaohsiung City's mountainous areas, 2,035 people were forcibly evacuated [42]. In Ren'ai Township, Nantou County, a couple fishing under a bridge drowned due to rising river water [43]. In Meinong District, Kaohsiung City, a man repairing water pipes on a mountain fell into a valley and died [44]. In Tainan City, three people jogging on the north breakwater of Anping Port were swept off the breakwater by rogue waves, resulting in one fatality [45]. \n\nThe Central Weather Bureau lifted the \"large-scale or severe heavy rain operation\" at 8:30 PM on the 7th [46]. The Council of Agriculture reported at 9:30 PM that 368 potential landslide streams were under red alert, 157 under yellow alert, with 4 large-scale landslide areas under red alert and 1 under yellow alert [47]. \n\nOn the 8th, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai visited the Qinhe section by land to inspect the disaster situation along the newly opened Gao 133 route in Liugui, the sheltering conditions in Taoyuan, and the large-scale landslide restoration work in the Maolin Wanshan area [48]. Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Luo Dasheng also inspected road damage in Shanlin and Jiaxian Districts on the same day, instructing the city government team and district offices to ensure disaster relief and reconstruction work [49]. Pingtung County Magistrate Pan Meng-an inspected the Sandimen New Bridge, which had reported cracks the previous day [50]. After observation and inspection by engineers, the bridge structure was deemed safe and reopened [51]. The following day, Premier Su Tseng-chang visited Pingtung, where he pledged to assist in resolving land acquisition issues for the flood detention pond project at Tajen University on Taiwan Sugar Corporation land [52]."

It had to remain at the harbor entrance until the tide rose. Subsequently, the ship ran aground on the northern breakwater of Budai Commercial Port. All nine crew members were evacuated, but due to poor sea conditions, oil extraction and other operations could not be carried out. The rescue team planned to conduct oil extraction and salvage operations on the afternoon of August 8. However, due to the difficulty of moving the ship, the shipping company decided to dismantle it on-site. The responsible maritime company estimated that the process would take at least 70 working days. The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the incident and found that the ship's log for the day of the accident and the previous day was not recorded, violating the safety management documents of Hai Sheng Company. They also noted that the Budai Management Office of the Taiwan International Ports Corporation's Kaohsiung Branch had not implemented control measures based on the safety improvement recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board after the previous Shengli ship incident.  \n\nOn August 8, rainfall across Taiwan gradually eased. The Central Disaster Response Center held its fifth work meeting at 11 a.m. and returned to the respective ministries' response mechanisms at 11:30 a.m. According to data compiled by the Agriculture and Food Agency of the Council of Agriculture from reports by various municipalities and county governments, the heavy rain event caused an estimated loss of approximately NT$742.43 million in agricultural products and private facilities. Before the impact of Tropical Storm Lupit on Taiwan, the Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs carried out water release and flood discharge operations for reservoirs with high sedimentation levels, such as Zengwen Reservoir and Wushantou Reservoir. On August 5, the Water Resources Agency also announced that, due to the influence of Typhoon In-Fa, Tropical Storm Lupit, and the southwest monsoon, Taiwan's water conditions had returned to normal, and the drought emergency response team, which had been in place for 324 days, was disbanded.  \n\nThe Dajia River Power Plant reported that as of 7 a.m. on August 8, the water level of the Deji Reservoir had reached 1,395.7 meters, with a storage volume of 140.58 million cubic meters, an increase of 17.18 million cubic meters from the previous day, marking the largest single-day increase in storage volume that year. The Southern Region Water Resources Office of the Water Resources Agency also noted that the Mudan Reservoir received a cumulative rainfall of 506 millimeters and a total inflow of 42.36 million cubic meters over the 10 days affected, approximately 1.6 times the reservoir's capacity."

Among them, after the road in front of Kaixuan Night Market collapsed, the Kaohsiung City Public Works Bureau originally planned to fill and level the area with grout at 9:30 a.m. the following morning. However, after Vice Mayor Lin Chin-jung inspected the site, he ordered the road to be paved by 5:30 a.m., saying, \"Otherwise, heads will roll!\" Former Kaohsiung City Information Bureau Director Cheng Chao-hsin criticized Lin's remarks on Facebook, stating, \"During my time serving in the Kaohsiung City Government, I only saw colleagues working together with high morale, and I never saw Mayor Han threatening to 'take someone's head' to make a point.\" Mayor Chen Chi-mai of Kaohsiung defended Lin, saying that Lin, as a former Public Works Bureau director, likely wanted the work to be completed quickly out of deep care and responsibility.\n\nIn response, Kuomintang (KMT) Kaohsiung City Councilor Huang Shao-ting criticized, \"After being labeled as the capital of deteriorating public safety, is Kaohsiung now becoming the city of sinkholes?\" Mayor Chen Chi-mai replied that after the heavy rain, road repairs and leveling had already begun to ensure safer roads, emphasizing that this work is ongoing. The \"WeCare Kaohsiung\" Facebook page, which successfully campaigned to recall Han Kuo-yu, listed 13 news reports of sinkholes during Han's tenure as mayor, claiming that his achievements in flood control and road maintenance were self-aggrandizing myths. This prompted netizens to counter by listing nine sinkhole incidents that occurred after Chen Chi-mai took office.\n\nKMT Chairman candidate Eric Chu, commenting on Kaohsiung's flooding issues, stated that many citizens had praised former Deputy Mayor Li Si-chuan of Han Kuo-yu's administration for doing an excellent job and suggested that Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) councilors and legislators should reflect on why \"Uncle Chuan\" could achieve results while the current administration cannot. In response, former Taichung City Government Information Bureau Director Chuo Kuan-ting and DPP Kaohsiung City Councilor Chiu Chun-hsien criticized Chu's remarks, accusing him of turning flood control into political rhetoric. DPP Legislator Hsu Chih-chieh further criticized Chu, saying, \"For the sake of your party chairman election, there's no need to create blue-green division by posting a photo of Kaohsiung on Facebook, especially when you might not even know the exact location in the picture.\""

Citizens flooded Mayor Chen Chi-mai's Facebook page, commenting, \"This wind and rain should warrant a suspension of work and classes, right?\" and questioned why disaster leave was not implemented as it was during the heavy rain on August 1. That afternoon, the Kaohsiung City Government only announced the suspension of work and classes in Liugui District, Jiaxian District, Maolin District, Taoyuan District, and Namaxia District.

Taipei City Councilor Lo Chih-chiang of the Kuomintang criticized President Tsai Ing-wen, saying, \"She seeks attention during the Olympics but disappears during floods!\" He stated that cheering for the Olympics is understandable, but the heavy rains and flooding in central and southern Taiwan should not be ignored. Legislator Ann Kao of the Taiwan People's Party also commented, \"The NT$250.7 billion water environment budget is largely spent on beautifying the environment and creating waterfront spaces, rather than solving water management issues or improving flood prevention standards.\" She further criticized, \"After enduring a drought, we now face floods and inundation. So where exactly has the Tsai administration spent all this money?\" In response, Premier Su Tseng-chang retorted, \"This is an amateurish statement,\" and explained that the water management budget is not solely for flood control but also includes water supply facilities. Regarding Ann Kao's remarks, Su further stated that the rainfall during the period reached 1,100 millimeters in a single day, which is unbearable for anyone, adding, \"People should be more humble and not always go against the environment.\" Ann Kao countered, \"That makes it even more necessary to spend money wisely and not on landscaping projects for ribbon-cutting ceremonies by officials.\" Chen Szu-yu, director of the office of Legislator Chiu Chen-yuan of the Taiwan People's Party, also raised doubts, pointing out that the highest rainfall in Taiwan was 1,084 millimeters in Pingtung County, not the 1,100 millimeters mentioned by Su, and criticized Su for mistakenly referring to \"1,084 millimeters\" as \"1,084 centimeters,\" which drew criticism from netizens. The Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the government, through the Forward-looking Water Environment Program, has constructed many water management facilities. Although the power of climate change cannot be entirely prevented by engineering, the measures have reduced flooding areas and accelerated water recession. On the 12th, during an Executive Yuan meeting on the \"0807 Flood Disaster Status and Recovery,\" Premier Su Tseng-chang instructed that the government had invested a total of NT$176 billion in water environment construction under the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program for stable water supply and flood control. He also noted that after experiencing a century-long drought, the flooding area during this disaster has significantly decreased, and water recession has sped up, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program."

Additionally, the low-pressure system followed the Vb track, which starts in Genoa, passes over the Adriatic, and leads northeastward to the Alps. This resulted in heavy rainfall associated with the low, with locally more than 250 mm within two days. For example, the Loibl station recorded 266 mm. At the Loibl Pass, 275 mm of rain was measured between August 3 and 5. The stations in Ferlach and Bad Eisenkappel reported a record for a 48-hour rainfall amount. The former Italian low-pressure system, with a lot of moisture and energy from the exceptionally warm Mediterranean, developed into a storm low and already reached Germany over the Baltic Sea on Monday, August 7, 2023. On its rear side, air from the Arctic was brought to Germany, and a new low-pressure system formed through the merging of two systems. Severe storm gusts of over 100 km/h were reported along the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts. Michael Knobelsdorf from the German Weather Service stated that it is extremely unusual for a storm low like Zacharias to occur at this time of year in August 2023."

Many people were evacuated in Slovenia, including in Črna na Koroškem[15] and the village of Koroška Bela (municipality of Jesenice)[17], both located on the Meža River. In Celje on the Savinja River, 4,000 residents were evacuated, electricity and gas were shut off for the urban area, and all households were instructed to boil tap water before drinking it.[18] The A1 and A2 highways were closed to traffic in several sections on August 4. Similarly, train services were suspended on the Kranj–Jesenice, Ruše–Bleiburg routes, in the Bohinj Tunnel, and near Velenje. As a result, there was no transportation connection available between the two largest cities in the country – Ljubljana and Maribor.[19] At least six people died in the storms,[1] and three bridges collapsed. Near the village of Dolnja Bistrica (municipality of Črenšovci), a flood protection dam on the Mur River was damaged.[15] Ten villages were affected by the dam breach. The Prime Minister of Slovenia, Robert Golob, stated that since Slovenia's independence, there had been no disaster causing greater damage: two-thirds of the country were affected by the flooding.[15] On August 6, Slovenia requested help from the EU and NATO, asking for technical aid to address the damage, such as bridges, excavators, and specialized vehicles for regulating watercourses.[20] As of August 8, the damages in Slovenia were estimated at several billion euros.[3] Primož Banovec from the University of Ljubljana criticized that since the country's independence, water infrastructure had been neglected. With only 150 employees, the water authority was unable to fully perform its tasks and prevent flooding.[21]"

In Carinthia, the focus of operations shifted to the city of Klagenfurt, where many basements were flooded, but pumping out water was not possible due to the immediately replenishing groundwater. As water was released from the Treimischer ponds due to the risk of flooding, a civil protection alarm also had to be triggered in the Carinthian capital.\n\nWhile rainfall in the flood-affected areas subsided on Sunday, August 6, the number of mudslides increased. As a result, numerous people had to be evacuated from endangered areas. Additionally, efforts began to stabilize vulnerable slopes by pumping out infiltrated water. On August 6, a man in Carinthia who had fallen from the flooded Glanradweg into the Glan river died.\n\nAlso on Sunday, August 6, the ORF, together with aid organizations, launched the donation campaign \"Austria Helps Austria,\" primarily requesting monetary donations. The interior minister also promised assistance from the disaster fund. People were strongly advised against so-called disaster tourism, which posed significant dangers. Adherence to orders in areas where civil protection warnings had been issued was also emphasized. On August 6, the two Styrian districts of Southeast Styria and Leibnitz were declared disaster areas. On Monday, August 7, most civil protection warnings in Carinthia and three Styrian districts remained in effect, and additional buildings were evacuated in St. Veit an der Glan and Maria Saal.

It drew its energy during its formation over the Mediterranean Sea, which in the summer of 2023 had an unusually high surface temperature of almost 30°C with correspondingly pronounced water evaporation. Additionally, the low-pressure system followed the Vb track, which starts in Genoa, passes over the Adriatic, and moves northeast toward the Alps. This led to heavy rainfall associated with the low, with local amounts exceeding 250 mm within two days. For example, the Loibl station recorded 266 mm. At the Loibl Pass, 275 mm of rain was measured between August 3 and 5. The stations in Ferlach and Bad Eisenkappel reported a record for a 48-hour rainfall amount. The former Italian low-pressure system, with a lot of moisture and energy from the exceptionally warm Mediterranean, developed into a storm low and reached Germany over the Baltic Sea as early as Monday, August 7, 2023. On its rear side, air from the Arctic was brought to Germany, and the merging of two low-pressure systems created a new one. Severe storm gusts of over 100 km/h were reported along the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts. Michael Knobelsdorf from the German Weather Service stated that it is extremely unusual for a storm low like Zacharias to occur at this time of year in August 2023."

The Environmental Agency then issued a highest-level warning for northeastern, northwestern, and central Slovenia.[16] The national flood protection and rescue plan was activated in the country. Many people were evacuated in Slovenia, including in Črna na Koroškem[15] and the village of Koroška Bela (municipality of Jesenice)[17], both located on the Meža River. In Celje on the Savinja River, 4,000 residents were evacuated, electricity and gas were shut off for the urban area, and all households were instructed to boil tap water before drinking it.[18] The A1 and A2 highways were closed to traffic in several sections on August 4. Similarly, train services were suspended on the Kranj–Jesenice, Ruše–Bleiburg routes, in the Bohinj Tunnel, and near Velenje. As a result, there was no transportation connection available between the two largest cities in the country – Ljubljana and Maribor.[19] At least six people died in the storms,[1] and three bridges collapsed. Near the village of Dolnja Bistrica (municipality of Črenšovci), a flood protection dam on the Mur River was damaged.[15] Ten villages were affected by the dam breach. The Prime Minister of Slovenia, Robert Golob, stated that since Slovenia's independence, there had been no disaster causing greater damage: two-thirds of the country was affected by the flooding.[15] On August 6, Slovenia requested help from the EU and NATO, asking for technical aid to address the damage, such as bridges, excavators, and specialized vehicles for regulating watercourses.[20] As of August 8, the damages in Slovenia were estimated at several billion euros.[3] Primož Banovec from the University of Ljubljana criticized that since the country's independence, water infrastructure had been neglected. With only 150 employees, the water authority was unable to fully carry out its tasks and prevent flooding.[21]"

Warnings were also issued in the municipalities of St. Georgen im Lavanttal and Bad Eisenkappel, while a civil protection alarm was already declared in St. Paul im Lavanttal and Loibach. On Saturday, August 5 alone, 2,500 emergency personnel were deployed. In Lavamünd, there were landslides. In Carinthia, the focus of operations shifted to the city of Klagenfurt, where many basements were flooded, but pumping out water was not possible due to the immediately replenishing groundwater. Since water was released from the Treimischer ponds due to the risk of flooding, a civil protection alarm had to be triggered in the Carinthian capital as well.\n\nWhile rainfall in the flood-affected areas subsided on Sunday, August 6, the number of mudslides increased. As a result, numerous people had to be evacuated from endangered areas. Additionally, efforts began to stabilize vulnerable slopes by pumping out infiltrated water. On August 6, a man in Carinthia died after falling from the flooded Glanradweg into the Glan River.\n\nAlso on Sunday, August 6, the ORF, together with aid organizations, launched the donation campaign \"Austria Helps Austria,\" primarily requesting monetary donations. The Interior Minister also pledged assistance from the disaster fund. People were strongly advised against so-called disaster tourism, which posed significant dangers. Adherence to orders in areas where civil protection warnings had been issued was also emphasized. On August 6, the two Styrian districts of Southeast Styria and Leibnitz were declared disaster areas. On Monday, August 7, most civil protection warnings in Carinthia and three Styrian districts remained in effect, and additional buildings were evacuated in St. Veit an der Glan and Maria Saal. The drinking water supply was threatened in two localities."

Due to the strong storm gusts, shipping companies adjusted their schedules to the islands and Halligen in North Frisia. The Altona Fish Market was flooded due to a storm surge. Rail traffic in Schleswig-Holstein was also restricted. On Monday, the storm caused little damage in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Between the Mecklenburg Lake District and the Baltic Sea, some trees fell since Monday evening but were quickly removed by the fire department.

In this area, in just eight days, about 30 billion tons of water fell. In Necochea, the rainfall reached 414 mm. Naturally, the water channeled into the river, seeking an outlet to the sea using the Quequén River's course. By the end of April, the river began to overflow, and its course became uncontrollable. This caused residents living along the banks of the Quequén River to start evacuating their homes. By April 28, the waters covered the entire riverbank and submerged houses, schools, and clubs; even the bus terminal had to be evacuated due to the flooding."

In the rural area, it is estimated that during this storm, 40% of the province of Buenos Aires was affected. In total, it is estimated that about 22,500 farms—large, medium, and small—were affected, with the latter two being the most impacted. The cities of Necochea and Quequén were especially affected by the destruction of the Ignacio Ezcurra Bridge, which was located near the river's mouth and the Port of Quequén, where a central section approximately 130 meters long collapsed. This bridge has not been rebuilt since then. That same day, the old railway bridge, which had been closed since 1966 and led to the Necochea station, also collapsed. Due to the strong pressure and force of the swollen river, the port was also affected. The advancing water, carrying logs, dead animals, furniture, and other debris, caused serious damage, undermining the old docks and embankments. In the port area, the grain conveyor belts of the National Grain Board were destroyed, rendering docks unusable and leaving the port inactive due to the blockage of the access channel caused by the accumulation of debris carried by the river's current to the mouth at the sea. Several vessels' moorings were also severed, leaving them adrift at sea. Of these, at least three sank, and several others ran aground in the following days along the Quequén coast. The Pesquera II, a mid-sized fishing vessel docked at the Port of Quequén, was torn away and carried by the current to the outer harbor, where it listed and sank, with no crew on board. A similar fate befell the Pesquera III, a mid-sized Soviet-made fishing vessel. Like the previous one, it was torn from the port and dragged to the Bahía de los Vientos beach, where it ran aground. On the same date, the fishing vessel Anna C also sank in the port's access channel. Meanwhile, the Caribea, which had been immobilized in the port due to legal issues since 1978, was dragged and stranded near the Colonia Pinocho in Quequén. In the outer harbor, the Pesquera II, Santa Elena I, Santa Rosa, the coastal vessel San Cayetano II, and the factory ship Knossos were stranded and severely damaged. The impact of the flood also had long-term consequences, as it caused a rupture in the tourism, port, and social dynamics, which remain disrupted due to the never-completed reconstruction of the Ezcurra Bridge."

The probability of this disturbance developing into a typhoon was low, and it moved slowly over the Taiwan Strait, bringing severe weather to central and southern Taiwan. Rainfall worsened starting on the 10th, and the Central Weather Bureau issued heavy rain and torrential rain warnings for nine counties and cities that afternoon. By 6:55 PM, the warnings were expanded to 10 counties and cities, with Chiayi County upgraded to an extremely heavy rain warning.

                "content": "On the afternoon of the 10th, the Chiayi County Government announced the suspension of work and classes in Alishan Township, Fanlu Township, Dahu Elementary School, Xiding Elementary School, and Zhongxing, Zhonghe, and Guanghua Elementary Schools in Zhuqi Township due to continuous heavy rainfall in the mountainous areas, which caused multiple large-scale landslides and falling rocks. In Fanlu Township, Zhongpu Township, Xingang Township, and Shuishang Township, accumulated rainfall also exceeded 200 millimeters. As the rain intensified after nightfall, a mudslide occurred in Wenfeng Village, Zhuqi Township, burying a mourning household's residence. The coffin of the deceased could not be moved in time and was buried in the debris, only to be found at 10:50 a.m. on the 11th. In Chiayi City, a wooden house at the intersection of Lanjing Street and Xingzhong Street collapsed due to the heavy rain, crushing several vendor carts. In Zhongpu Township, Chiayi County, an outdoor banquet scene showed people still enjoying the feast despite the flooding. In the same township, a car was swept into a field, trapping two people who were later rescued. At the Yongqin No. 2 Bridge in Chiayi County, several vehicles were submerged and trapped in water. Firefighters deployed rubber boats for rescue operations, saving a total of 32 people. Near the Yongqin No. 2 Bridge, the Wujidehua Hall was flooded to about the height of the first floor. The Chiayi City Fire Department rescued three trapped individuals and, along the way, saved three more people awaiting rescue at Xingfu Ranch.\n\nAt 7:12 a.m. on the 11th, police and firefighters discovered a couple dead inside a van under the bridge of Chiayi Route 175 crossing Taiwan Route 82 in Shuishang Township, Chiayi County. It was determined that the couple drowned after their vehicle stalled and could not be restarted due to flooding. It was not until noon that the Directorate General of Highways announced the reopening of two-way traffic on Taiwan Route 82, while the mud and debris on Chiayi Route 175 were cleared by the Chiayi County Government and Shuishang Township Office before traffic resumed. Shuishang Township Mayor Lin Xiangting stated that the flooding in Geqiliao and the nearby Hongwa Village in Chiayi City's West District was severe, with water gushing out of manhole covers. She criticized Chiayi City for being \"selfish\" by discharging water into Shuishang Township. In response, the Chiayi City Government explained that mobile pumps had been deployed to assist with drainage since four years ago, but the cross-section of the Nanjing drainage system passing through Taiwan Route 1 and the railway was too small and still required improvement. Chiayi County Magistrate Weng Changliang conducted a disaster inspection on the 11th with township mayors and Executive Yuan policy advisor Chen Guanting, promising to permanently install pumps in Geqiliao, Shuishang Township, to discharge water into the Tougang branch line. Local residents expressed dissatisfaction with Chen Guanting, a Democratic Progressive Party candidate for the 2024 Legislative Yuan election, for inspecting the disaster site, while independent legislative candidate Lin Guoqing was absent. They criticized Lin's election approach, saying, \"Ignoring the people's suffering is outrageous and infuriating.\"\n\nOn the 11th, the Chiayi County Government held a work meeting for the \"0910 Heavy Rain Disaster Response Center\" to address the disaster situation. Magistrate Weng Changliang stated that the meteorological forecast predicted only 70 millimeters of rainfall, but the actual rainfall exceeded 200 millimeters, leading to an inadequate response. He pledged to improve warning efficiency. The heavy rain caused the drowning of 60,000 egg-laying chickens at a livestock farm in Shuishang Township, and hundreds of pigs also perished in the flood. According to preliminary statistics from the Chiayi County Agriculture Department on September 12, the agricultural losses from this heavy rain event amounted to approximately NT$30,275,000."

National Chiayi University also announced the suspension of work and classes. However, the neighboring Chiayi City Government announced that work and classes would proceed as usual on the 11th. A meeting of principals from national high schools and vocational schools in Chiayi City decided at 2 a.m. on the 11th to suspend classes but not work. However, Chiayi City Government's Director of Education, Kuo Tien-Tsai, stated that junior high and elementary schools would operate as usual, sparking criticism and complaints from residents. In response, Chiayi City Mayor Huang Min-Hui stated, \"The shared living circle of the county and city is one of the considerations for suspending work and classes, but there are other aspects to consider. High schools and vocational schools also have their own considerations, and they report to the K-12 Education Administration of the Ministry of Education. We respect their decision.\" She further pointed out that according to the weather report, \"The rain on that day was expected to gradually stop last night. Once the rain stops or lessens, or after the rain stops, the water will recede.\""

According to experts, the decision to build the city in the river's floodplain was a mistake, as it posed a threat of flooding to the city. From 1970 to 1997, the frequency of floods in Yakutia was minimal, which caused the population to almost lose their fear of them. In the 1990s, funding for riverbed deepening and bank reinforcement works was sharply reduced. According to Roshydromet, the snow cover level in Siberia at the beginning of 2001 exceeded the norm several times. Winter air temperatures in many areas of Yakutia reached −60 degrees. Severe and prolonged frosts made the ice on the Lena River stronger and 30–50 cm thicker than normal, increasing the likelihood of ice jams on the river. In early May, the temperature difference between the Irkutsk region and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) reached 20 degrees, contributing to the accumulation of water in the upper reaches of the Lena. In addition, on May 12, a sharp warming began with heavy precipitation, and on May 13, ice drift started in the Lensky District. The speed of the ice drift was record-breaking, with the ice covering 250 kilometers in a day and encountering Batamai Island, located 40 kilometers from Lensk. As a result, a giant ice jam up to 80 kilometers long formed near the island."

After the flood, an embankment dam 2.5 meters high was constructed, intended to protect the city from the river. In March 2001, specialists from the Far Eastern Regional Center of EMERCOM of Russia noted that the flood situation on the Lena River in the spring of that year would be very difficult. Preparatory flood control efforts in 2001 cost 370–400 million rubles. Nevertheless, for Yakutia, these efforts proved insufficient."

An Il-76 aircraft with humanitarian aid also arrived. After explosive operations, the water level temporarily dropped to 1300 cm. On May 17, early in the morning, the second wave of flooding arrived. By noon, 90% of the city was already flooded, and the water level reached 18 meters. Reconnaissance discovered an ice jam 110 kilometers from Lensk, but attempts to blow it up were unsuccessful. The Chairman of the Government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Vladimir Vlasov, who arrived in Yakutsk from Lensk, described the situation in the city as \"catastrophic.\" On May 18, the city was completely flooded, with the airport becoming the last evacuation point. By 3:30 PM, the maximum water level of 20 meters 12 cm was observed, after which a gradual decline began. By May 19, the situation in the city had normalized. Over three days, 860 people were evacuated from the rooftops of buildings where they had sought refuge from the high water, and medical assistance was provided to 150 victims.

The cause of these floods was a series of stationary convective storms caused by moisture from the intertropical convergence zone (with anomalous activity due to the 2023-2024 El Niño Event) carried by an atmospheric river along a frontal shear line associated with a deep trough at all levels of the atmosphere that was located over the Dominican Republic. The torrential rains and severe flooding affected the entire country, but mainly Greater Santo Domingo (which received a record 431 mm of rain), the Lower Yuna Valley, Independencia Province, Montecristi, and San Pedro de Macorís. A significant event was the collapse of the lining of the tunnel on February 27 Avenue in Santo Domingo, which crushed several vehicles.

Despite its potential, no cyclonic development occurred, and the alerts were discontinued by the National Hurricane Center.

On November 18, the floods caused by the weather system affected the Dominican Republic, causing various tragedies, including the collapse of bridges and the overflowing of rivers. In Greater Santo Domingo, flash floods inundated entire neighborhoods, swept away vehicles, and caused the collapse of the tunnel on February 27 Avenue. In the Bajo Yuna area, 2,927 families remain isolated due to flooding caused by the overflow of the Yuna River. At least one person died when a vehicle was swept away by the strong water current in the lower Yuna River area.

The year 2023 was already marked by numerous extraordinary weather events in other parts of the world, many of which could be attributed to climate change through attribution research. Unusual floods occurred in Europe, for example, in May in Italy, in August in Austria and Slovenia, and in September in Greece. In November and December, Switzerland experienced exceptional flooding. Model calculations show that the likelihood of heavy rainfall and flooding is also increasing in Germany due to climate change, with these events becoming more frequent and intense, precipitation shifting from summer to winter, and precipitation occurring less often as snow and more often as rain. Sea surface temperatures, which have been consistently higher than previously recorded since March 2023, play an important role in this. From these record-warm seas, water evaporates more strongly, creating warmer air with higher absolute humidity, meaning more water vapor content. From such air, more liquid water can condense and rain down – also over land. This process also generates more condensation heat, which drives weather activity through thermals. At the beginning of December, there were already extreme precipitation events; during the onset of winter in southern Germany in December 2023, Munich recorded the largest amount of snow since weather records began, and in Lower Saxony, rainfall in December was about 45 percent higher. Climate researcher Stefan Rahmstorf wrote in light of the Christmas Eve flooding: \"Extreme precipitation is increasing worldwide and also here due to global warming. Climate researchers have been warning about this for over 30 years; weather station data has long confirmed this.\""

                "content": "In view of persistent rainfall and the resulting saturated soils, the flood situation in numerous regions of Germany was already tense before Christmas 2023. Shortly before Christmas, parts of Germany experienced prolonged heavy rainfall that lasted for several days. The cause was a prolonged westerly wind pattern due to a strong jet stream, which brought numerous low-pressure systems from the North Atlantic to Europe. Before and during Christmas, very heavy rainfall occurred along an air mass boundary where moist, warm subtropical air met cold air over Germany. Meteorologist and climatologist Daniela Jacob described the extent of the flooding in early January as \"very unusual.\" On December 22, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service was activated to monitor a predicted flood area in Lower Saxony via satellite. On December 29, the state of Lower Saxony requested assistance from the German Armed Forces. On December 30, Germany activated the European Civil Protection Mechanism, and the district of Mansfeld-Südharz declared a state of emergency. On January 1, 2024, the German Weather Service issued severe weather warnings and warnings of significant weather for 49 districts, as prolonged heavy rainfall with precipitation amounts of up to 90 l/m² was expected from January 2 to 4, this time also affecting the southern half of Germany. On January 2, 2024, Lower Saxony received a 1.2-kilometer-long mobile dike system from France through the European Civil Protection Mechanism, which was deployed in Winsen (Aller). France, also affected by flooding, requested six high-performance pumps through the Civil Protection Mechanism on January 2. On January 3, satellite mapping for the Saarland was requested via Copernicus. By January 4, Lower Saxony had almost completely depleted its own stock of approximately 1.9 million sandbags and received additional deliveries of about 1.5 million sandbags from other federal states. On January 4, further flooding occurred in the west, south, and central parts of Germany. Rivers rose in northern and eastern Bavaria, with several gauges exceeding alert level 3. In the Saarland, numerous firefighting operations were carried out, and authorities in Hesse also warned of rising water levels in the Fulda and Lahn rivers, with similar warnings for major rivers such as the Rhine, Main, and Neckar. As of January 12, some gauges in Lower Saxony were still above the highest alert level, but authorities issued initial cautious all-clear signals due to generally falling water levels. It was expected at this time that water levels would continue to drop and fall below alert levels during the following week. On the same day, the district of Mansfeld-Südharz lifted the state of emergency after 14 days, as there was no longer any acute danger. However, the deployed sandbags would remain in place for the time being. Due to the renewed rise in water levels in the Weser and Aller catchment areas as a result of frequent and intense rainfall, warning level 2 was declared at some Weser gauges and warning level 3 at many Aller gauges until February 13, 2024."

Hunters from the Bremen area reported that they had to collect and dispose of numerous dead wild animals after the water receded due to the risk of disease.

Additionally, preparations for the expected flood situation had improved compared to earlier times. At the beginning of January 2024, Holger Schüttrumpf, head of the Institute for Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management at RTHW Aachen, assessed the current flood situation in Germany as \"very widespread, but fortunately not dramatic.\" There was a lot of water in the affected areas of the country, \"but also over a very large area.\" The flood waves had built up over days before the turn of the year 2023/2024, rather than over just a few hours as in 2021. This had given authorities time to warn people and activate disaster relief forces and materials. The DWA experts were surprised by the large number of softened dikes, even though there had been hardly any dike overflows. In the future, meteorological-hydrological approaches to preventing future flood events should be reviewed in areas with widespread flooding, such as at the turn of the year 2023/2024. On January 11, 2024, Westdeutscher Rundfunk criticized that many measures from the \"roadmap\" for dike rehabilitation in North Rhine-Westphalia, decided in 2014, had \"still not been implemented\" by 2024. Environment Minister Oliver Krischer saw \"a need for action on half of the dike kilometers in NRW.\" In January 2024, the NRW state government described the flood as \"one of the most severe in decades.\""

Over 3.8 million people in the Horn of Africa were affected overall, including about 2 million in Somalia, 1.4 million in Ethiopia, and nearly 500,000 in Kenya. At least 1.6 million people were displaced from their homes, including about 746,000 in Somalia, 613,000 in Ethiopia, and 310,000 in Kenya. The most affected regions in Somalia were Bay (at least 495,600 affected), Gedo (at least 354,900), Jubbada Dhexe (at least 280,000), Hiiraan (at least 267,000), Mudug (at least 213,300), Jubbada Hoose (at least 199,000), and Shabeellaha Dhexe (at least 103,500). Approximately 1.5 million hectares of primarily agricultural land were likely destroyed in Somalia alone. Before the floods, the Horn of Africa experienced the worst drought on record, which caused food insecurity for millions of people between 2020 and 2023."

The rivers in the Mugello area overflowed, particularly the Sieve, flooding the entire town of Pontassieve and destroying its bridge and the Franciscan convent. The water level rose to a height of forty braccia, about twenty-three meters above the riverbed, effectively flooding all the nearby fields and carrying with it tree trunks and much debris in the current. At the gates of Florence, at the confluence with the Sieve, which had flooded the Mugello area, the level of the Arno River quickly rose to a high level: the plain of San Salvi was submerged by about ten braccia (almost six meters), and the water reached the city center, passing through Porta alla Croce at one in the afternoon on August 13, 1547. The overflow of the Arno caused the flooding of Piazza Santa Croce, so much so that the river level rose to cover the church steps. Subsequently, the waters reached the Canto de’ Pazzi, passing through Piazza di San Pier Maggiore to Borgo Pinti and finally flooding the current areas of Santa Trinita, Borgo Ognissanti, and reaching San Niccolò. Between the Rubaconte Bridge, now Ponte alle Grazie, and Ponte Vecchio, the flood caused damage to two hundred and fifty braccia of riverbank. The river also invaded Piazza del Grano and the nearby Piazza della Signoria, submerging the offices of the Gabella del Sale and the Contracts Office, which were then located on the lower floor of Palazzo Vecchio. According to Giovan Battista Adriani, the victims in the Mugello area were about one hundred, and more than sixty bodies were found on the riverbanks, while Bernardo Segni estimated the damages at three hundred thousand scudi."

In fact, in the inland areas upstream of Savona, an impressive amount of rainfall formed rivulets, small streams, brooks, and waterfalls that became increasingly impetuous and violent as they descended from the heights to the main watercourses, which quickly flowed towards the coast, dragging along all sorts of debris, medium and large trees, vegetation, construction waste, caravans, large tanks, and various refuse. All this material caused a series of blockages along the watercourses descending towards the sea. The Letimbro stream crosses Savona, passing under about ten bridges and walkways, and receives water from 22 minor tributaries, plus one very significant one, the Lavanestro. The same dangerous situation arises for the Quiliano stream, which receives two tributaries, one of which is the Quazzola, and runs for about 15 kilometers in the valley of the same name to Zinola, where it flows into the open sea. A similar situation occurs in Altare, next to which flows the Bormida."

The flood also hit the Cairnese district, and the Ferrania plant was evacuated in the early afternoon.

This resulted in very heavy rainfall in a small region, instead of the precipitation being distributed over a larger area. Additionally, a humid and warm weather pattern caused a significant amount of water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere. This is occurring more frequently due to human-induced climate change, as the atmosphere can absorb more moisture at higher temperatures.  \nSpring in Germany was the warmest since weather records began. Since the Mediterranean Sea was about 2 to 3 degrees too warm, the low-pressure system was able to absorb a lot of moisture there. According to a preliminary report from the DWD on May 17 at noon, the rain began in Baden-Württemberg, where widespread amounts of 40 to 50 liters, and even up to 70 liters per square meter in northern Baden, were recorded. The rain area then expanded to the southern parts of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. For example, in Saarbrücken, between 70 and 80 liters per square meter fell within 12 hours, with the majority of this rain, which would normally fall in a month, occurring within six hours.  \nOverall, on May 17, more than 100 liters of rain per square meter fell in some places within 24 hours; in large parts of Saarland, it was 60 to 100 liters per square meter. The DWD issued a warning of the highest category, \"extremely heavy continuous rain,\" for some regions and warned of 20- to 50-year flood events and beyond in some water bodies. On May 18, Holger Schüttrumpf, a professor of hydraulic engineering and water management at RWTH Aachen, classified the floods in Saarland as 50- to 100-year floods, meaning they are rare but not \"absolutely extraordinary.\""

Almost the entire Saarland experienced flooded roads, water-filled basements, or landslides. Authorities anticipate significant property damage. In Fremersdorf, the Saar River reached a level of 7.65 meters, the highest since records began. In Saarbrücken, 16 transformer stations had to be shut down, causing power outages. Near Quierschied, a dam broke, flooding the grounds of the Weiher coal power plant. In Ottweiler, dams broke, flooding the old town. The district office was also evacuated, and power was preemptively shut off for safety reasons. In Blieskastel, the old town was flooded after water backed up from the sewer system. Many municipalities experienced power outages, and in some places, gas supply, internet, and telephone services also failed. At least 54 state roads and six federal roads were affected by the flooding over the weekend. The city highway in Saarbrücken was closed for several days, and a number of roads suffered severe damage from washouts, collapsed roadways, and landslides, requiring long-term closures. In several locations, people trapped by the floodwaters had to be rescued. In Neunkirchen, around 150 people were rescued from a hotel. Parts of Saarbrücken were evacuated; in the Rußhütte district, residents had to be rescued from their homes using boats and amphibious vehicles. Additionally, 100 residents of a nursing home had to be evacuated. Train services were severely disrupted. A woman was struck by an emergency vehicle and died. A Red Cross helper also died of heart failure after a mission. In total, there were well over 4,000 operations involving more than 10,000 rescue workers from several federal states, including the Technical Relief Agency and the German Armed Forces. Anke Rehlinger, the Minister-President of Saarland, which was particularly hard-hit, stated that the flooding situation there was the worst since the century flood of 1993. In addition to emergency workers from Saarland, helpers from Hesse, Baden-Württemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Bavaria were also deployed to manage the flooding. The extent of the damage is still unknown. On May 20, 2024, Rehlinger stated that the flooding had caused \"massive damage to private property, as well as infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and daycare centers,\" and that Saarland would likely struggle with its consequences for years. The president of the Saarland Chamber of Agriculture, Ecker, stated that over 300 of the approximately 1,100 agricultural businesses in Saarland likely suffered damage from the flooding, particularly due to the destruction and contamination of crops by water and pollutants such as leaked heating oil, resulting in crop failures. He also anticipated a very high pressure from snails following the flooding."

                "content": "The 1403 Mashhad flood occurred on May 16, 1403, following heavy rain and hail. This intense rainfall caused many streams in Khorasan Razavi to overflow, leading to a flood in Mashhad that caused significant human and financial losses along its path. The torrential rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, at 2:30 PM on May 16 in Mashhad resulted in street flooding and darkened skies in this metropolis. According to the head of Khorasan Razavi's crisis management, 38 millimeters of rain fell in Mashhad within an hour. The primary cause of the Mashhad flood was this volume of rainfall. The most damage from this flood was reported in the Seyedi area. Many blame Mashhad Municipality as one of the main culprits for the damages caused by this disaster. An examination of the water's path shows that it first entered Namaz Boulevard and then the Seyedi and Sepah neighborhoods. Additionally, the water and flood entered the terminal bridge and accumulated there. Another issue being discussed is a hypothesis that Mashhad Municipality does not confirm: that there are gates at the terminal bridge in Mashhad that can pass a large volume of water, and naturally, water should not have accumulated there. It is said that these gates may not have functioned properly, or according to some experts, they may have been blocked on one side. However, the municipality rejects this hypothesis, stating that the channel was blocked due to debris in the floodwater, preventing proper water flow. This caused three meters of water to accumulate, leading to the death of two people. Investigations also show that 15 cars and about 8 motorcycles were trapped in the Enqelab Square and terminal bridge in Mashhad, which were removed from the water by firefighting equipment by the night of the incident. This process continued until the night of May 16, and the bridge and square were reopened the next day. This flood led to the dismissal of Mostafa Kalidari, Mashhad's crisis management director, after his denial of the incident. Three days later, on May 19, 1403, another flood and heavy rainfall occurred in Mashhad, with significant rainfall recorded at various rain gauge stations in the city, ranging from 19 to 25 millimeters within 30 minutes. The flooding of streets caused the main routes in the city to be blocked, leading to severe traffic restrictions on May 19. Following this event, the head of the National Center for Forecasting and Crisis Management of the Meteorological Organization stated that weather warnings about hazards such as torrential rains are issued days in advance to inform people and officials to take necessary precautions. Continuing to issue warnings during an event is not beneficial. The Secretary-General of the Red Crescent Society also said that this incident was due to the lack of proper infrastructure, and such rainfall and hail had no precedent in the city's history. It was as if stones were falling from the sky, damaging the windows and roofs of cars directly hit by the hail. The May 1403 rainfall in Mashhad was unprecedented, with the city experiencing 133.3 millimeters of rain in this month alone, marking a 300% increase in rainfall in just the second month of 1403."

The floodwaters initially destroyed the wooden dormitory houses of the district and deposited the debris in the yard of building 26, with the water level reaching the third floor of the building, resulting in the drowning of one resident. Due to the overflow of the Lalvar stream, the buildings of riverside warehouses and first-floor shops were destroyed, and the goods inside were carried into the Debed River. The overflow of the Debed River damaged the Yerevan-Tbilisi railway and highway, making transportation impossible. The hospital, court, and other state institutions, as well as the school, kindergarten, and residential buildings, were damaged. The floodwaters entered the first floors of the buildings, sweeping away the belongings inside. After the flood, layers of mud 1 to 3 meters thick formed on the city's streets. The city park, roads, and private houses were destroyed, and landslides and collapses occurred. Animal casualties were recorded. As a result of the disaster, the Haghpat and Sanahin stations suffered significant damage, and the water supply, sewage, electricity, gas supply, and communication networks were destroyed. The operations of some workshops of the metallurgical plant and the Alaverdi bread factory were halted. The floodwaters also entered the substation of the brewery, and the water swept away barrels filled with beer and bottles of lemonade."

The breach reached its maximum width of approximately 226 meters the following morning [2]. The government and military began sealing operations on the afternoon of the second day [3][4][5], completing the closure by the night of July 8 [6][7]. \n\nAfter the dike breach was sealed, drainage operations commenced to clear the accumulated 210 million cubic meters of water [8]. By the night of July 10, the number of drainage devices at the Tuanzhou Dike floodwater pumping site had increased to 266, and the water level within the dike continued to decrease [9]. \n\nThis disaster caused significant property damage, including the flooding of several villages within the dike area. However, due to timely warning responses, affected residents were urgently evacuated and resettled, resulting in no casualties [10]."

The grasslands and forested hills in the Western Ghats there had been destroyed by the British government for commercial purposes. Naturally, these areas used to retain water and control the flow of floods. Additionally, there were no dams in the hills at that time, and only structures like stone weirs and Kodiveri dams existed in the plains. As a result, the monsoon floods surged eastward without barriers. Due to the heavy southwest monsoon rains in the Western Ghats, the plains of Tamil Nadu experienced massive floods in July 1924, even without rainfall. Catastrophic floods occurred three times—on July 16, July 23, and later on July 26 and 27. On July 24, the Cauvery River carried 4.63 lakh cubic feet of water, and on July 26, it carried 4.56 lakh cubic feet of water. On July 16 and 18, near Sathyamangalam, the floodwaters rose to 23 feet, and in the Cauvery River, it rose to 36 feet. In the following two days, the flood level increased to 38 feet. The floodwaters rose two feet above the Bhavani Sagar Bridge."

In the Trichy-Coimbatore road area, the Kaveri river changed its course for five kilometers, destroying the road. The surrounding walls of the Srirangam Ranganatha Swamy Temple collapsed. On July 18, the Kollidam river bridge collapsed.

Additionally, in the adjoining areas, including the South Arcot district, sand deposits of 1.5 to 6 feet high formed over 12,202 acres of land. This flood caused the death of up to 10,000 people. The stench of corpses spread everywhere. Epidemics broke out. With food and shelter destroyed, prices rose, and wages decreased. Famine spread, forcing people to migrate in large numbers.

The period of rain in the Eastern Pyrenees lasted from October 16 to 20. Officially, 840 mm of rain was recorded on October 17 alone, making it the record for precipitation registered in Europe within 24 hours, despite meteorological services being interrupted due to World War II. However, a teacher from Sant Llorenç de Cerdans noted 1930 mm over the five days of the episode, 1,000 mm of which were concentrated on October 17. [2] The rains were less intense in the Black Mountain. The Canal du Midi broke due to the rains in the Pyrenees. Almost all rivers from the Llobregat basin to the Tet basin overflowed. In Catalonia, 58 bridges and 380 houses were destroyed. About 175,000 hectares of farmland were completely flooded. In Northern Catalonia, around 200 buildings collapsed, and three hydroelectric power plants were completely destroyed, including the one at Llau. [2] The human toll of the episode was over 400 deaths. The most devastated area was around the Canigó massif, where there were more than 200 victims. [2] This episode had a significant impact on the inhabitants of the regions that suffered the destruction. In Olot, it has remained in memory in the form of poems or songs that recall such an event with an ironic tone. [2]"

However, upstream of the confluence with the Allier, the level of this 1856 flood was significantly lower than in 1846 and 1866, and equivalent to that of 1907. Many towns were partially submerged: Blois, Tours, Trélazé, etc. In the latter municipality, the Ardoisières quarry was engulfed, causing production to halt for several months. Many old houses bear flood marks from the Loire on their walls. Many of these date back to the campaign of commemorative plaque installation in the flooded areas, which was undertaken in 1856 to preserve the memory of the disaster."

In Lyon, the damage was very significant, particularly on the left bank, which was undergoing a period of construction. 18 people died in the commune of La Guillotière.

The overflowing waters devastated the countryside of the lower Veronese and Polesine areas, eventually pouring into the Tartaro-Canalbianco, causing breaches in its banks at Bergantino, Zelo, and Frassinelle Polesine. When floods occurred south of the Canalbianco, Venetians would immediately cut the banks of the Fossa Polesella to facilitate the flow of water toward the sea; if this measure had been taken immediately in this case, the disaster would have been significantly less severe. On this occasion, the Civil Engineering Department of Rovigo acted with culpable delay, proceeding to cut the Fossa only on September 30; in the meantime, the entire territory from the Valli Grandi Veronesi to the Fossa had been flooded. Thirty-nine municipalities were devastated. The commission appointed by the Ministry of Public Works decided to build two new drainage channels in Polesine, one on each side of the Canalbianco, leaving the latter as the exclusive outlet for the Valli Grandi Veronesi; however, only the Collettore Padano Polesano on the right side was actually built."

After destroying obstacles such as bridge foundations, dams, and channel walls, it flowed along Pahlavi Street, one of the city's main streets, engulfing all the surrounding buildings. This flood, which lasted about two hours and took three hours to gradually subside, continued towards areas such as the railway station and parts of neighborhoods like Bagh Golestan, Ahrab, Shah Abad, and Kucheh Bagh. In addition to destroying homes and warehouses, such as the Saray Amir, it also disrupted some administrative centers, including the buildings of the police, judiciary, municipality, and provincial offices. It is said that after the dam's destruction, the flood flowed onto Pahlavi Street and immediately began destroying houses, buildings, and shops along the street. It quickly reached in front of Karim Khan Mosque, where it split into two parts: one part rushed towards the old street, engulfing the street bazaar, the city's finance office, and the tobacco office. The power station, Shapur Square, the statistics office, the education department, the police departments, the judiciary, the municipality, the police headquarters, the provincial building (Ali Qapu), and Saray Amir were among the places partially or completely destroyed or surrounded by water due to the flood. This flood turned the entire Pahlavi Street into a muddy river, and throughout the city, the sound of collapsing houses, water-filled buildings, and the cries of flood victims could be heard."

This was while, due to the disruption of telegraph lines, officials in Tehran and other provinces did not have accurate information about the event. On August 2, at Fahimi's invitation, a meeting of the heads of civil and military departments, as well as prominent city figures, was held. After the governor's remarks describing the city's situation and the flood victims, about twenty prominent individuals present were elected as representatives of Tabriz's seven districts to join the \"Flood Victims Commission,\" which began its work on August 4. The main task of this commission was to collect donations and aid from the wealthy in Tabriz and other parts of the country and distribute these financial aids among the flood victims. Meanwhile, as damaged departments were relocated to other buildings and administrative affairs became more organized, with the re-establishment of direct telegraph communication between Tabriz and Tehran on August 4, national officials, upon learning of the extensive scale of the flood and its destruction, initiated a series of measures to address the issue. Initially, aid from the capital was individual and uncoordinated, such as a donation of one hundred thousand tomans by Reza Shah or contributions from Azerbaijan's representatives in the National Assembly and some Azerbaijani merchants residing in the capital, which were quickly sent to Tabriz. However, after receiving and publishing more detailed reports on the matter, a committee of sixteen members was formed to establish a relief commission. This commission took on the main responsibility of collecting and directing public donations. According to available reports, in addition to other cities in Azerbaijan, centers for collecting aid were opened in places such as Mashhad, Qazvin, Sari, Babol, Borujerd, Rasht, Hamedan, Yazd, Arak, Kermanshah, and Khuzestan. Based on the detailed list of received donations published in the booklet \"Income and Expenditure Report of the Flood Victims Commission,\" about 62% of the total received aid was collected from the capital and other cities in Iran."

One of the first actions taken after the flood occurred was the assignment of a municipal engineering team to rebuild the waterways. The restoration of the Quri Chay and Meydan Chay waterways through excavation, rebuilding walls, demolishing constructions that had been built in them, and the construction of dams in Nazamiyeh and other areas were among the measures initiated with the allocation of a 200,000-toman budget by the government."

The Civil Defense Directorate announced the death of a Yemeni resident due to the floods and torrents caused by the storm. The storm is considered the most severe in Riyadh since 1997, with rainfall in Riyadh exceeding 60 mm. The storm was caused by the passage of a low-pressure system in northern Saudi Arabia and the formation of a surface low over Al-Majma'ah Governorate, located north of Riyadh.

The Xingtai authorities responded, stating that the only upstream reservoir, Dongchuankou Reservoir, is an open-type reservoir where discharge cannot be controlled, and there is no issue of human scheduling of the discharge. The floodwaters entering Qili River came from two sources: one from the overflow of Dongchuankou Reservoir and interval inflows, and the other from the flood diversion channel in Xingtai's urban area. These two sources converged to form a major flood. Additionally, the sudden narrowing of Qili River at Daxian Bridge caused the flood to overflow the banks and breach, leading to water entering villages in the development zone.\n\nAround the time of the Spring Festival, Xingtai City began a centralized urban heating project. The construction unit, in order to allow the heating pipeline to pass through Qili River, piled the excavated soil in front of Daxian Bridge to build a dam, blocking the river channel horizontally. The original earthen dam was also removed and piled into the river channel. The Xingtai flood control department had twice urged the clearing of the river channel, but the construction unit failed to act in time. Many villagers believe that the lack of local flood control awareness, the removal of the dam, the blockage of the river channel, and the near-filling of the bridge opening were the main reasons why the upstream floodwaters suddenly surged near Daxian Village and rushed into the villages.\n\nAfter the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government workgroup arrived in Xingtai, they reviewed relevant meteorological data and conducted on-site inspections of the Qili River channel, the breach site, and the upstream Dongchuankou Reservoir. They preliminarily concluded that the breach of Qili River on the night of July 19 was caused by a flood peak formed by localized heavy rainfall rather than human factors."

Villagers stated that apart from a broadcast warning about half an hour before the flood entered the village, they did not receive any other warnings. An official from the Water Resources Bureau of the Xingtai Economic Development Zone said in a media interview that the development zone did not receive a notice from the higher-level flood control office to evacuate residents from the night of July 19 to the early morning of July 20. Meanwhile, an official from the Xingtai City Flood Control and Drought Relief Command Office stated that the city flood control office did issue an evacuation notice to the economic development zone at that time but could not recall the specific time. On July 23, the deputy mayor of Xingtai City stated at a press conference that the city flood control office notified the development zone to organize the evacuation of residents at 1:40 a.m. on July 20, and the relevant departments of the development zone immediately entered Daxian Village. Multiple villagers in Daxian Village reported to the media that during the approximately seven hours from the early morning of July 20, when the flood entered the village, until around noon that day, rescue forces were slow to arrive, and most of the rescue work was organized spontaneously by villagers after the floodwaters receded slightly. In response, the head of the Xingtai Municipal Party Committee's External Publicity Office stated in an interview with reporters that rescue forces rushed to the disaster area immediately after the flood broke out, \"It was definitely notified in time to evacuate, but the specific rescue situation is not yet clear.\""

He deeply reflected on these shortcomings and apologized to the families of the victims, the affected residents, and the public. The Xingtai Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection initiated accountability procedures, suspending and investigating those responsible for inadequate performance during the flood response. Duan Xiaoyong, Secretary of the Party Working Committee and Director of the Management Committee of Xingtai Economic Development Zone, Zhang Guowei, Secretary of the Party Committee of Dongwang Town, and Guo Tongheng, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Wangkuai Town, were suspended and investigated."

                "content": "The flood in the Czech Republic in 2013 occurred in three consecutive waves: the first from May 29 to June 5 after several days of rain, mainly in the area of the Central Bohemian Uplands, but also in the northwest and northeast of Bohemia; the second, far less intense, came as a result of heavy local rains in the saturated South Bohemian basins from June 10 to June 12; and the third, the weakest wave, from June 24 to June 27, 2013, in the areas of the Krkonoše Mountains, Jizera Mountains, and the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands. Especially during the first wave, streams and rivers in many places reached levels of 20- to 50-year floods, and not uncommonly even 100-year floods. A total of 970 municipalities across the Czech Republic were affected, including several large cities such as Ústí nad Labem, Děčín, Prague, Plzeň, and České Budějovice. The Czech government also declared a state of emergency on Sunday, June 2, 2013, by decision no. 140/2013 Coll., for the capital city of Prague (effective until June 19) and for the regions of Liberec (until June 12), South Bohemia, Plzeň (until June 19), Hradec Králové, Central Bohemia, and Ústí (until June 28). However, the army remained on alert until July 15, 2013. Firefighters responded to 9,611 incidents related to the floods, deploying 9,518 fire units (3,748 professional and 5,770 volunteer) with approximately 28,500 personnel. Additionally, in accordance with the Central Alarm Plan of the Integrated Rescue System, 21,000 members of the Czech Police (including dozens of dog handlers and bomb disposal experts) were deployed, and 9,324 soldiers of the Czech Army (including members of the Castle Guard) with 1,585 pieces of equipment were rotated in 71 towns and municipalities. The Czech Red Cross Water Rescue Service was also activated. A total of 26,438 people were evacuated, and 618 people were rescued. The floods claimed 15 lives (including five victims among kayakers attempting adrenaline descents on swollen rivers; one other kayaker is missing) and caused at least 75 landslides (arguably the most serious above the village of Litochovice nad Labem, where a sliding slope over an area of approximately 10 hectares destroyed railway line 097 and the under-construction D8 motorway). Additionally, 214 road sections of all classes had to be closed. The necessary direct (initial) costs for measures to address the crisis situation amounted to 1.16 billion CZK, and the total damages are in the tens of billions. The morning peak of the Elbe River in Děčín on June 6, 2013, at 4:00 a.m. reached a height of 1,071 cm and a flow rate of 3,910 m³/s, making it the fourth-largest flood in the Czech Republic. The 2013 floods also affected Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as western Slovakia (mainly Bratislava), Hungary, and Poland."

                "content": "After a relatively overcast and rainy spring in 2013, a significant part of the Czech Republic's territory was saturated with water from spring thaw and rainfall. Particularly, the month of May was above average in precipitation for the Bohemia region (approximately 2/3 more rainfall), which naturally led to higher soil saturation. The immediate cause was a low-pressure system over Central Europe, which brought intense rainfall activity in a north-south direction over the areas of Saxony, Bavaria, Bohemia, and Austria by the end of May. Additionally, a chain of strong storms occurred in this zone, with extensive areas recording precipitation totals exceeding 100 mm/24 hours. On May 28, 2013, the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute issued a serious warning about the threat of storms with heavy rain and hail for the period of May 29–30. A flood warning followed the next day, particularly for the Lužická Nisa basin, the Berounka tributaries, and the upper Elbe. On May 31, 2013, a flood alert was in effect for the South Bohemian Region and a flood warning for the Plzeň Region."

However, the high rainfall initially caused rivers in the Pilsen area to overflow – perhaps with the exception of the Mže River. On Tuesday, June 4, the release from the cascade was halted to ease the peak flow on the lower Elbe, but from June 7 to June 11, the Central Crisis Staff's directive to ensure maximum possible retention capacities in case of further heavy rainfall was reinstated. During these four days, the Vltava Cascade managed to empty 215 million m³. The flood also affected the Troja slalom canal."

Although it briefly dropped on Saturday, by 9:00 PM it was already at the 3rd flood stage (180 cm) and continued to rise slowly throughout Sunday, reaching its maximum on Monday at 1:00 AM: 225 cm, 22 m³/s (two-year water). The 3rd flood stage was left only on Tuesday evening, June 4, and the 1st flood stage on Thursday morning, June 6. In Ždírec, only the 2nd flood stage was reached with 33 m³/s; the flood state lasted from June 1, 4:00 PM to June 6, 10:00 AM. However, in Koterov, Úslava was at the 1st flood stage already on May 31 at 6:00 AM, and from Saturday 11:00 PM to Tuesday 10:00 PM, it was at the 3rd flood stage (above 200 cm), with a maximum of 270 cm / 132 m³/s on Monday around 4:00 AM. It returned to normal on Thursday after 3:00 AM. Úhlava also rose, exceeding the 1st flood stage (250 cm) in Klatovy on Friday morning, May 31, and the 3rd flood stage (300 cm) on Sunday at 5:00 AM, maintaining it until Monday evening with a peak of 315 cm / 69 m³/s, dropping below the 1st flood stage on Thursday after 7:00 PM. The limnigraph in Přeštice recorded the 1st flood stage (180 cm) on Friday morning, the 3rd flood stage (250 cm) after midnight on Saturday, and a peak of 315 cm / 160 m³/s (twenty-year water) on Monday morning. The 3rd flood stage was canceled on June 5 after 6:00 PM, and the 1st flood stage on Saturday, June 8, around 2:00 PM. In Štěnovice, the 1st flood stage (160 cm) was exceeded on Friday after 7:00 PM, the 3rd flood stage (320 cm) on Sunday around 5:00 PM, and the peak occurred on June 3 at 2:30 AM at 370 cm / 170 m³/s (more than twenty-year water). Radbuza in Tasnovice surpassed the 1st flood stage (120 cm) already on Friday, May 31, before 6:00 PM, the 3rd flood stage (180 cm) on Monday, June 3, between 2:00 AM and 2:00 PM, with the river peaking around 4:00 AM at 280 cm / 48 m³/s (ten-year water). The 1st flood stage was canceled on June 4 after 7:00 PM and re-declared on Monday, June 10, after 9:00 AM, with a peak in the 2nd flood stage occurring on Tuesday, June 11, around 4:00 AM at 160 cm / 16 m³/s, and a drop below the 1st flood stage occurred the same day after 1:00 PM. In Staňkov, Radbuza reached the 1st flood stage (160 cm) even earlier, on Friday around 8:00 AM, and remained below the 3rd flood stage (220 cm) from Friday evening, exceeding it from Saturday 3:00 PM to Wednesday 6:00 AM, with a peak at 306 cm / 99 m³/s (almost ten-year water) on Monday after 7:00 PM. It returned to normal on Thursday, June 6, just after midnight, and fluctuated around the 1st flood stage again on Sunday, exceeding it on Monday, June 10, after 6:00 AM, and rising sharply to the 3rd flood stage within about ten hours, with a peak of 255 cm / 60 m³/s on Tuesday before noon. The water level then dropped even faster than it rose, and the 3rd flood stage was canceled five hours later, with the 1st flood stage canceled on Wednesday, June 12, at 7:00 AM. Mže was initially the calmest; for example, the Lučina reservoir recorded the 1st flood stage only briefly on Saturday, June 1. However, in Kočov, the river fluctuated, exceeding the 1st flood stage (120 cm) for several hours on Saturday, June 1, and reaching the 2nd flood stage on Monday, June 3, peaking there before 6:00 AM at 105 cm / 29 m³/s (almost five-year water) and returning below the 1st flood stage just before midnight. Due to the inflow from Úhlavka, however, it exceeded the 1st flood stage (150 cm) in Stříbro on Saturday evening, peaking on Monday after noon at 220 cm / 84 m³/s (two-year water, just below the 3rd flood stage), and dropped below the 1st flood stage only on June 6 after noon. The Hracholusky reservoir partially captured this wave, but after filling the reservoir, it had to start releasing water in the 1st flood stage range (above 200 cm) at a flow rate of 54 to 56 m³/s for several days, ending this release only on Friday, June 14, after 7:00 AM. Střela, which exceeded the 1st flood stage (120 cm) at the Žlutice reservoir outlet on Saturday, June 1, around 8:00 AM, peaked 48 hours later at 205 cm / 20 m³/s (two-year water) in the 2nd flood stage range. It returned to the 1st flood stage on Wednesday at noon and maintained an outflow of around 8 m³/s in the 1st flood stage range in the following days. In Čichořice, it exceeded the 1st flood stage on Saturday after 2:00 PM and left it on Wednesday after 9:00 PM, rising twice to the 2nd flood stage in the meantime and peaking on Tuesday, June 4, around 10:00 AM at 170 cm / 26 m³/s (two-year water). In Plasy, it was at the 1st flood stage (120 cm) from June 1, 2:00 PM, and from June 2, 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM, it was also in the 3rd flood stage (above 200 mm), with a peak of 230 cm / 60 m³/s around 8:00 AM. It returned to normal only on Friday, but new rains raised it again on Sunday, June 9, and it peaked on Monday, June 10, in the 2nd flood stage range at 190 cm / 43 m³/s, returning to normal on Wednesday, June 12, before 10:00 PM. Klabava in Hrádek u Rokycan was at the 1st flood stage already from Thursday evening, May 30, and subsequently fluctuated: for example, the 3rd flood stage was declared three times, reaching 215 cm / 53 m³/s (ten-year water) twice – on Saturday, June 1, before 11:00 PM, and on Sunday, June 2, before midnight; it dropped below the 1st flood stage only on Wednesday, June 5, in the afternoon. Further downstream, in Nová Huť, Klabava reached the 1st flood stage (120 cm) on Friday after 5:00 AM and the 3rd flood stage (200 cm) already that day at noon, peaking on Monday at 7:00 AM with a water level of 250 cm and a flow rate of 138 m³/s (twenty-year water), and returned to normal on Thursday after 9:00 PM. The second wave of rain raised it to the 1st flood stage in most places only for a few hours on Monday, June 10, but increased outflow from the Klabava reservoir caused a new peak of 210 cm / 48 m³/s (two-year water) in Nová Huť on Tuesday, June 11, after 7:00 AM. The 3rd flood stage was in effect there from 3:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the same day, and the 1st flood stage was definitively canceled on Wednesday, June 12, around 8:00 PM. It is therefore clear that the Berounka, as the collecting river for southwest Bohemia, could not avoid flooding. On Friday, May 31, after 2:00 PM, it reached the 1st flood stage (250 cm) in Plzeň, and on Sunday, June 2, after 6:00 PM, it reached the 3rd flood stage (450 cm), peaking on Monday, June 3, around 7:00 AM at 525 cm / 388 m³/s (ten-year water). Although it left the 3rd flood stage range on Wednesday, June 5, around 6:00 AM, it did not return to normal even by the end of the week despite a gradual decline. After taking in tens of cubic meters of water from Klabava and Střela, the Liblín limnigraph recorded the 1st flood stage (180 cm) on Friday after 3:00 PM, the 3rd flood stage (340 cm) on Sunday after 7:00 AM, and a maximum of 440 cm / 640 m³/s on Monday, June 3, at noon. The 3rd flood stage was canceled only on Wednesday morning, and the 1st flood stage even on Sunday after noon. Due to new intense rains, a new wave arrived, but this time the river only rose to the 2nd flood stage range, peaking with a flow rate of 290 m³/s on Tuesday, June 11, in the morning; it returned to normal only on Thursday, June 13, in the afternoon. A similar course was registered in Zbečno: the 1st flood stage (240 cm) was reached on Friday, May 31, before noon, the 3rd flood stage (400 cm) on Saturday, June 1, before midnight, and a maximum of 610 cm / 900 m³/s on Monday, June 3, after 8:00 PM. The 3rd flood stage lasted until Thursday at 5:00 AM, and in the following days, the river remained in the 1st flood stage range. On Monday, June 10, before 11:00 PM, it rose again to the 2nd flood stage range, peaking at 320 m³/s on Tuesday, June 11, after noon. It returned to normal only on Saturday, June 15, around 1:00 AM. Litavka only reached the 1st flood stage thanks to the flood on the upper course being slowed by the Láz reservoir. In Příbram, the peak occurred at 74 cm / 5 m³/s on Monday after 5:00 PM, but due to streams from the Brdy area, it rose to the 1st flood stage (150 cm) on the inflow to Beroun on Saturday and to the 3rd flood stage (250 cm) on Sunday evening, peaking on Monday just after midnight at 260 cm / 145 m³/s (ten-year water) and quickly dropping, falling below the 1st flood stage on Tuesday, June 4, at 9:00 PM. On the Berounka in Beroun, the 1st flood stage (260 cm) was exceeded on Friday after 8:00 PM, and the 3rd flood stage (400 cm) at the turn of Saturday and Sunday, with the highest level reached on Monday at 9:30 PM at 577 cm / 1150 m³/s (more than twenty-year water). The 3rd flood stage was canceled only on Wednesday, June 5, after 5:00 PM, and the 1st flood stage on Saturday, June 8, before 6:00 PM. However, a new flood occurred shortly after, and the river peaked again on Tuesday, June 11, after 2:00 PM, this time in the 2nd flood stage range with a flow rate of over 320 m³/s. The 1st flood stage was then canceled on Thursday, June 13, before noon."

                "content": "The Cold Vltava reached only the 1st flood activity stage (SPA) at the Černý Kříž limnigraph on the morning of Saturday, June 1, 2013, and maintained it until the evening, when it dropped again. In contrast, the Warm Vltava in Lenora was already rising at that time, reaching the 1st SPA (130 cm) after 11 p.m. on June 1, and by around 7 a.m. on Sunday, June 2, it reached the 2nd SPA (170 cm), peaking around 9 a.m. at 176 cm / 63 m³/s, narrowly surpassing the threshold of a ten-year flood. It dropped below the 1st SPA here on the evening of Monday, June 3. At the Chlum limnigraph, the 1st SPA (220 cm) was recorded only on June 2 at 7 a.m., and the water level narrowly (did not) reached the 3rd SPA (270 cm) after 12 p.m. with a flow rate of 90 m³/s (surpassing a five-year flood), then slowly decreased, with the 1st SPA being canceled only on Tuesday, June 4, before 6 a.m. The entire Vltava cascade showed a free volume of about 180 million cubic meters on Saturday, June 1. The flood wave from both Vltavas was partially mitigated by the Lipno Reservoir: in Vyšší Brod, the 1st SPA (185 cm) was exceeded only on June 2 between 6 and 11 a.m., but due to the increase in the retention capacity of the Lipno Reservoir, it was reached again around 6 p.m., and after midnight, the 2nd SPA (210 cm) was also exceeded; from then on, the flow (or outflow) ranged at the level of a two-year flood between 98 and 106 m³/s, increasing to 120 m³/s from Wednesday evening, and as the water receded in the lower reaches, water managers were able to increase the outflow from Lipno to 130 m³/s (from Friday morning, June 7, to Sunday morning, June 9) at the level of the 3rd SPA, which, however, did not cause major problems in other locations. High outflows from Lipno continued into the following week, approximately 110 m³/s until Wednesday, June 12, and only with a drop below 80 m³/s on Thursday evening, June 13, could the 1st SPA be canceled here. In Zátoň, the Vltava rose to the 1st SPA (160 cm) at 4 a.m. on Sunday, June 2, and between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., it even maintained the 3rd SPA (210 cm) at 230 cm and 200 m³/s, oscillating in the 2nd SPA range in the following days due to the release from the Lipno Reservoir with a flow rate of up to 160 m³/s (i.e., again a two-year flood), later in the 1st SPA range with flow rates of 110–140 m³/s, and the river dropped below the 1st SPA here at noon on Thursday, June 13. A few kilometers downstream, the Vltava met the flood wave from the Polečnice (45 m³/s in Novosedly around 10 a.m. on Sunday) and the Chvalšinský stream (23 m³/s in Chvalšiny at the same time), so the Polečnice rushed into Český Krumlov as a swollen stream – it exceeded the 1st SPA (100 cm) before midnight on June 1 and reached the 3rd SPA (170 cm) around 3 a.m. on Sunday, peaking at 290 cm / 101 m³/s before noon and leaving the 3rd SPA only on Monday, June 3, after 9 a.m., and the 1st SPA on Wednesday, June 5, after 10 p.m. The Vltava was not to be outdone; in Spolí, the local 1st SPA (185 cm) was exceeded shortly after midnight on Sunday, June 2, and the 3rd SPA before 4 a.m., with the Vltava peaking at 290 cm / 310 m³/s simultaneously with the Polečnice; both exceeded the twenty-year flood level. The Vltava then maintained the 3rd SPA here until Wednesday, June 12, and returned to normal only on Friday, June 14, before noon. Above České Budějovice, the 1st SPA (170 cm) was also exceeded in Březí after midnight, and by 3 p.m., the water level briefly approached the 3rd SPA! (337 cm), the extreme flood threshold, with a height of 324 cm, and the flow rate at that time was over 480 m³/s (almost a fifty-year flood), with the 3rd SPA being canceled only on Tuesday, June 4, after 2 p.m.; the Vltava maintained the 2nd SPA (above 200 cm) until Sunday and dropped below the 1st SPA only on Wednesday, June 12, before midnight. The Malše in Kaplice reached the 1st SPA (110 cm) shortly after midnight on June 2, 2013, exceeded the 3rd SPA (160 cm) at 3 a.m., and the water level continued to rise to a maximum after 6 p.m. at 237 cm / 82 m³/s, with the 3rd SPA lasting until Monday afternoon and the 1st SPA until Wednesday evening. The subsequent limnigraph in Pořešín (already below the confluence with the also swollen Černá stream) recorded the 1st SPA (130 cm) at 1 a.m., the 3rd SPA (190 cm) was exceeded about 1.5 hours later, and the peak occurred around 6 p.m. at 300 cm / 178 m³/s, with the 3rd SPA lasting until Tuesday at 5 p.m. and the 1st SPA until Thursday at 7 a.m. Additional cubic meters were added by the Stropnice, which exceeded the 1st SPA (180 cm) in Borovany on Sunday before 6 a.m. and the 3rd SPA (260 cm) 24 hours later, peaking on Monday, June 3, after 6 p.m. at 315 cm / 30 m³/s (a two-year flood) and remaining in the 3rd SPA range until Wednesday noon, dropping below the 1st SPA only on Sunday before 4 a.m. Similarly, at the Pašinovice-Komařice station, it peaked twice: 345 cm / 106 m³/s (a ten-year flood) on Sunday afternoon and 286 cm / 67 m³/s on Tuesday after midnight, with the Stropnice dropping below the 3rd SPA on Wednesday around 4 p.m. and below the 1st SPA on Thursday before midnight. The last Malše limnigraph before the confluence with the Vltava, in Roudné, recorded the 1st SPA (160 cm) already on June 1, 2013, after 11 p.m., the 3rd SPA (270 cm) was exceeded at 3 a.m., and the Malše maintained it until Wednesday at 5 p.m., peaking at the level of a ten-year flood on Monday, June 3, after 2 a.m. at 380 cm / 230 m³/s. It returned to normal only on Saturday, June 8, at noon. In České Budějovice, the main flood waves from the Vltava and Malše combined, but only briefly: the 1st SPA (300 cm) was recorded on Sunday, June 2, after 3 a.m., and the 3rd SPA (430 cm) shortly before noon, with the peak occurring around 7 p.m. at 490 cm / 580 m³/s (a twenty-year flood), and then the water quickly receded; the 3rd SPA was canceled on Monday after 2 a.m., and the 1st SPA on Wednesday at 6 p.m. Despite high outflows from Lipno and Římov and the persistent 2nd SPA on the Vltava and Malše, the river below České Budějovice remained at a relatively safe level, below the 1st SPA."

The 3rd flood stage was canceled on June 3 before 3 AM, and the 1st flood stage on June 4 after 10 PM. At the Husinec reservoir outflow, Blanice held the 1st flood stage (95 cm) on the morning of June 2, quickly rising to the 3rd flood stage (130 cm) by 1 PM and reaching 250 cm with a flow of up to 95 m³/s (fifty-year water) after 3 PM. It dropped below the 3rd flood stage only on June 6 after 10 AM and below the 1st flood stage on Friday after 9 PM. In Bavorov, Blanice reached the 1st flood stage (140 cm) on Saturday before 10 PM, the 3rd flood stage (190 cm) on Sunday after 3 AM, and rose to 300 cm / 185 m³/s (more than fifty-year water) at 5:30 PM. The 3rd flood stage was canceled only on June 6 after 7 PM, and later the river fell to the 1st flood stage. However, a new wave of rain raised Blanice again to the 3rd flood stage on Monday evening, June 10, with a new peak at 240 cm / 103 m³/s (more than ten-year water) on Tuesday, June 11, around 2 AM. The river dropped below the 1st flood stage only on Wednesday, June 12, before 6 PM. At the Heřmaň station, the 1st flood stage (110 cm) was reached on June 1, 2013, at 11 PM, and the 3rd flood stage (180 cm) on Sunday after 8 AM. Twenty-four hours later, the maximum was reached at 275 cm (the 3rd flood stage threshold is 288 cm) / 200 m³/s, i.e., fifty-year water. The 3rd flood stage persisted until Friday at 3 AM, but the river did not return to normal by the end of the week and rose again to the 3rd flood stage on Tuesday, June 11, after noon, peaking at 190 cm / 84 m³/s (five-year water) at midnight, and within five hours, the river dropped below the 3rd flood stage, returning below the 1st flood stage only on Thursday, June 13, after 1 PM. The Otava itself reached the 1st flood stage (140 cm) in Rejštejn only on June 1, 2013, around 11 PM, and on Sunday, it occasionally reached the 2nd flood stage, peaking after 7 PM at 170 cm / 111 m³/s, and returned to normal after 6 AM on Monday. In Sušice, the 1st flood stage was reached on Saturday at 10 PM, and the 3rd flood stage (175 cm) was reached twice on Sunday, with a maximum of 220 cm and 205 m³/s (almost ten-year water) at 9 PM. The 3rd flood stage was canceled on June 3 at 5 AM, and the 1st flood stage on June 4 before noon. Below the confluence with Blanice, in Písek, the Otava has the 1st flood stage set at 250 cm (reached on June 2, 2013, at 1:30 AM), the 3rd flood stage at 380 cm (exceeded after 3 PM), and a maximum of 525 cm / 545 m³/s (more than twenty-year water) was reached on Monday after noon. It returned below the 3rd flood stage on Wednesday after 8 AM and below the 1st flood stage 72 hours later. A new flood from Blanice then slightly raised the Otava into the 1st flood stage zone on Monday evening, June 10, which was also canceled on Wednesday morning, June 12. The Nežárka in Rodvínov reached the 1st flood stage on Sunday, June 2, at noon, peaking at 160 cm (just surpassing the 3rd flood stage) / 47 m³/s on Monday at 6 AM, and dropped below the 1st flood stage on Wednesday after 4 AM. After receiving twenty-year water from the Hamerský stream (approximately 19 / 20 m³/s from Monday evening to Wednesday morning), the Lásenice limnigraph recorded the 1st flood stage (150 mm) on Sunday, June 2, at 5 AM, and narrowly reached the 3rd flood stage (230 cm) on Monday for about 11 hours, with a flow of 73 m³/s (more than five-year water). The flood state lasted until Friday at 11 AM. On the Nová River, which relieved the Lužnice, the 3rd flood stage was in place in Mláka from Tuesday, with a maximum of 330 cm / 75 m³/s (ten-year water) on Wednesday morning. The water level dropped very slowly, and the 3rd flood stage was canceled only on Saturday afternoon. However, around 55 to 60 m³/s continued to flow, on Tuesday, June 11, even just 45 m³/s (1st flood stage), but on Thursday, June 13, again up to 55 m³/s (2nd flood stage again). This amount decreased only slowly, and the 1st flood stage was canceled only on Sunday, June 16, at 6 PM. Similarly, the Hamr limnigraph reached the 1st flood stage (290 cm) on Sunday, June 2, at 10 PM, and the 3rd flood stage (350 cm) on Monday after 1 PM, peaking on June 5 at 7 AM at 424 cm / 148 m³/s (twenty-year water). The 3rd flood stage persisted until Monday, June 10, at 2 AM, and dropped below the 1st flood stage only on Saturday, June 15, at noon. The Lužnice was also flooded along its entire length. The Nová Ves limnigraph exceeded the 1st flood stage (150 cm) on June 2 around 1 PM, peaking at 202 cm / 98 m³/s (ten-year water) in the 2nd flood stage zone, and returned to normal on June 5 around 1 PM. The Pilař limnigraph exceeded the 1st flood stage (300 cm) on June 2 after 4 PM, the 3rd flood stage on June 3 at noon, and peaked at midnight at 420 cm / 131 m³/s (twenty-year water). It dropped below the 3rd flood stage on June 5 before noon and below the 1st flood stage only on Sunday after 1 PM. Thanks to the relief Nová River, however, the Kazdovna, Rožmberk, and Frahelž stations did not record a flood extreme worse than ten-year water. Below the confluence of the Nežárka and Lužnice, the Černovický stream also flowed into the river (where the Tučapy station recorded up to 13 m³/s on Sunday evening, June 2), and the Klenovice limnigraph easily exceeded the 1st flood stage (190 cm) on Sunday, June 2, around 2 AM, and the 3rd flood stage (300 cm) on Monday, June 3, at noon. The maximum of 330 cm / 220 m³/s (ten-year water) lasted from Wednesday noon to evening, and then the level slowly dropped. However, it returned below the 3rd flood stage only on Friday after 4 PM – temporarily, as the 3rd flood stage was again present on Sunday evening and was definitively left on Monday, June 10, before 3 AM. For most of the week, two-year water flowed here in the 2nd flood stage (canceled only on June 14 at 10:30 PM), and even on Sunday, June 16, the 1st flood stage persisted here. After the Lužnice was further strengthened by the Smutná stream (which had the 1st flood stage in Rataje from Saturday at 10 PM and the 3rd flood stage from Sunday at 4 AM to Tuesday at 3 AM; the maximum of 347 cm / 131 m³/s on Sunday, June 2, before noon even exceeded the 3rd flood stage and represented hundred-year water; the 1st flood stage ended only on Wednesday, June 5, at noon), the devastation in Bechyně was practically inevitable: the 1st flood stage (240 cm) was exceeded just before midnight on Saturday, and the 3rd flood stage (330 cm) on Sunday, June 2, at 3 AM. The 3rd flood stage threshold (525 cm) was exceeded at 9 AM, peaking after 3 PM with a water level height of over 590 cm and a flow of around 610 m³/s (hundred-year water exceeded). The 3rd flood stage lasted until Friday at 10 PM, and the water continued to drop only slowly. On Monday, June 10, it even returned to the 3rd flood stage for several hours, peaking at 340 cm / 200 m³/s (more than two-year water). It dropped below the 2nd flood stage only on Wednesday, June 12, and the 1st flood stage was approached only on Sunday evening, June 16. To the Orlík reservoir, where the waters of all three rivers converge, about 1500 m³/s was heading on Sunday afternoon. Therefore, a reserve was already made for this wave by increasing the outflow – on June 2, 2013, at 6 AM, up to 350 m³/s was released, but this outflow had to be quickly reduced to 178 m³/s to protect other places along the flow. However, the reservoir filled unexpectedly quickly: the predicted inflow maximum of 910 m³/s had to be revised several times due to heavy rains and the rapid rise of all tributaries, and the real maximum at the level of hundred-year water (2300 m³/s) occurred during Sunday. The reservoir's retention space was used to the maximum (the level stopped 2 cm below the maximum), and from Sunday evening, it was necessary to release 1400 to 1700 m³/s again, peaking at up to 1950 m³/s on the night from Monday to Tuesday. This gradually emptied the Orlík retention space, and by Sunday morning, the outflow could already drop to \"only\" 650 m³/s, on Tuesday, June 12, to 320 m³/s, and then temporarily rose to 500 m³/s, later dropping to normal values below 300 m³/s. This wave was not significantly slowed down even by the Slapy Reservoir, which maintained most of the day outflow at 205 or 305 m³/s on Saturday, June 1, and Sunday, June 2. However, on Sunday afternoon, 380 m³/s was already being released here, and from the evening up to 1600 m³/s, later up to 2050 m³/s on the night to Tuesday. Here too, the reservoir's storage space was increased, and the outflow could gradually be reduced, from Saturday evening, June 8, to 1000 m³/s, and on Sunday even to 900 m³/s, later 650 m³/s or less. The Sázava sent additional masses of water into the Vltava already on Sunday afternoon. The Český Šternberk station recorded the 1st flood stage (100 cm) on Sunday before noon and the 3rd flood stage (160 cm) shortly after noon, peaking at 227 cm / 370 m³/s (ten-year water) before 10 PM. Then the level quickly dropped, the 3rd flood stage was left already on Monday, June 3, at 4 AM, and the 1st flood stage 48 hours later. The Nespeky limnigraph recorded the 1st flood stage (230 cm) on Sunday, June 2, after 3 AM, and the 3rd flood stage (380 cm) was maintained from noon, peaking on Monday at 4 AM at 540 cm / 510 m³/s. The 3rd flood stage lasted until Tuesday at 11 PM, and the 1st flood stage until Saturday at 10 PM. The Kocába also significantly flooded on Sunday, June 2, 2013. The previous day at 6 PM, it exceeded the 1st flood stage (110 cm) in Štěchovice, and on Sunday after 6 AM, the 3rd flood stage (150 cm), peaking before 6 PM at 240 cm / 104 m³/s (hundred-year water exceeded). It returned below the 3rd flood stage on Wednesday after 1 AM and below the 1st flood stage on Friday, June 8, around 4 AM. The Vrané Reservoir tried to balance the flood wave from the unregulated Berounka, which flows into the Vltava a few kilometers below it. On the night from Saturday, June 1, to Sunday, June 2, it had an outflow of up to 500 m³/s, but this quickly rose during the day, exceeding 1000 m³/s after 2 PM, and by 5 PM, 1290 m³/s was being released to Prague. At 7 PM, only 954 m³/s, but by 8 PM, already 1712 m³/s. The subsequent extreme flood then disabled the flow meter."

During Saturday, boats were being removed from the Vltava River in Prague[13], and on Sunday at 9:45, the mayor declared a \"State of Danger\" for the capital city[6]. By the afternoon, the water level in Chuchle had reached 350 cm with a flow rate of over 1770 m³/s. Thanks to the management of the Vltava Cascade, the flow rate through Prague was maintained at 2100 m³/s for a long time, reaching 2900 m³/s on Sunday evening[13]. However, the uncontrolled tributaries of the Vltava, especially the Berounka, Botič (which flooded areas like Hostivař and Záběhlice), and Rokytka, swelled significantly. The Vltava peaked in Prague on Tuesday, June 4, at 3:50 a.m., with a flow rate of 3210 m³/s and a water level of 545 cm (the 3rd flood stage threshold here is 574 cm)[13]. Afterward, the flow rate sharply decreased as the management of the Vltava Cascade gradually managed to balance the uncontrolled tributaries from the Berounka or free up reservoir spaces in dams for the forecasted new rains. It dropped below the 3rd flood stage only on Saturday, June 8, after noon, with the flow rate decreasing from 1600 to 1250 m³/s within three hours. On Monday, June 10, it briefly dropped to the 1st flood stage, but a new wave of water due to further rains raised the level back to the 2nd flood stage on Tuesday, June 11, with a maximum of \"only\" 240 cm / 1008 m³/s. However, it was not until Sunday, June 16, before 3 a.m., that the water dropped below the 1st flood stage. The limnigraph in the center of Prague, near Na Františku Hospital, recorded an increase from 300 cm / 500 m³/s on Friday, May 31, at night to 547 cm / 3193 m³/s on Tuesday, June 4, at 7:00 a.m., which was the peak there. The Prague Public Transit Company had already suspended tram service to Troja on Saturday, and on Sunday, June 2, it closed the first 8 metro stations (trains only passed through them).[16] On Monday, June 3, metro service in the city center was completely halted. The metro stopped running in the sections Dejvická – Muzeum, Smíchovské nádraží – Českomoravská, and Muzeum – Kobylisy. Some tram lines were also canceled.[17] As a replacement for the metro, two substitute tram lines (X-A, X-B) and one bus line (X-C) were established, and tram service was suspended in some sections (Palmovka – Ke Stírce, the line to Modřany). All ferry services were suspended. Ferries P3 and P5 were restored during June, ferry P6 was reopened on July 13, 2013, and ferries P1 and P2 were expected to be operational by July 20, 2013.[18][19]"

On Tuesday, June 4, water managers maintained the outflow from the Skalka reservoir just below the 1st flood stage level. Similarly, the Svatava River exceeded the 1st flood stage (94 cm) at the Kraslice gauge on Saturday, June 1, 2013, at 11 p.m., and peaked on Sunday around 9 a.m. with a water level of 138 cm and a flow rate of 55 m³/s (a twenty-year flood), returning to normal on Tuesday after 3 a.m. Conversely, the Odrava River could not be regulated further at the Jesenice reservoir near Cheb: it exceeded the 1st flood stage (80 cm) on May 31 before 9 p.m. and rose slowly, exceeding the 3rd flood stage (170 cm) on Tuesday, June 4, and peaked at midnight at 190 cm and 29 m³/s, which corresponds to a two-year flood. It left the 3rd flood stage on Wednesday, June 5, after 9 p.m., and remained at the 1st flood stage until the following week. New rains on Tuesday, June 11, raised the water level to the 3rd flood stage for several hours during the night, but flow rates remained well below 20 m³/s. The Teplá River increased its flow throughout Sunday, June 2, and remained in the 1st flood stage along its entire length, with its inflow into the Ohře reaching up to 44 m³/s on Monday morning. As a result, the Drahovice gauge on the Ohře exceeded the 1st flood stage (190 cm) shortly after midnight on Saturday and the 3rd flood stage (270 cm) after midnight on Sunday. The maximum was 273 cm / 275 m³/s (a five-year flood) on Sunday, June 3, around 3 a.m., but the water level soon dropped, and the 3rd flood stage was canceled around 7 a.m. The Ohře returned to normal on Thursday, June 6, around 3 a.m. The Rolava River temporarily reached the 1st flood stage on Sunday morning, peaking at 180 cm / 58 m³/s (a ten-year flood) around 4 a.m. The lower-lying Klášterec nad Ohří recorded a maximum on Monday, June 3, around 7 a.m., at 272 cm / 402 m³/s (a five-year flood), and dropped sharply to normal levels during Tuesday and Wednesday. The Chomutovka River exceeded the 1st flood stage on Saturday evening and remained at the 2nd flood stage for about thirty hours, leaving the flood stage on Tuesday evening (peaking on Sunday afternoon with a ten-year flood at 118 cm / 20 m³/s). Meanwhile, in Žatec, the 1st flood stage on the Ohře did not need to be declared despite a flow rate of 275 m³/s (a two-year flood). However, below the confluence of the Ohře, Chomutovka, and Blšanka in Louny, the Ohře exceeded the 1st flood stage (400 cm) on Saturday around 6 p.m. and the 3rd flood stage (490 cm) on Monday at 10 p.m. At a water level of 545 cm, the flow rate reached up to 316 m³/s but did not exceed a two-year flood. The 3rd flood stage was maintained until Friday, June 7, when it began to drop at noon, and alternated between the 2nd and 1st flood stages until the following week.

Similarly, the Srbská Kamenice River did not experience significant extremes: on both Saturday, June 1, and Sunday, June 2, it briefly reached the 1st flood stage (120 cm) and the 2nd flood stage (145 cm) for only a few hours. The highest flow rate of 36 m³/s (twenty-year water) at a water level of 157 cm occurred on Saturday around 4 p.m."

The water then quickly receded, and SPA 3 was canceled the same day before 11 p.m., with the Elbe returning below SPA 1 on Monday after 7 p.m. However, the Elbe itself caused almost no damage – the problem was caused by the left-bank tributary, the Čistá stream: after a night of continuous downpour, it unexpectedly gathered a large amount of water from Hertvíkovice on Sunday morning, and a wave of water rushed through Rudník and Arnultovice to Hostinné, where the water rose 3 meters above normal at 7:00 a.m., and the immediate water flow in the Elbe was more than 260 m³/s (instead of the usual 3–4 m³/s), but within the next 6 hours, it had already dropped by half. An army helicopter had to assist with the evacuation of residents. This flood wave then moved along the Elbe and dispersed; the Les Království dam reached SPA 1 (150 cm) on June 2, 2013, before 3 a.m., but SPA 3 (180 cm) was declared just two hours later. After 10 a.m., the water level stabilized for the entire day at around 233 cm and an outflow of about 147 m³/s (more than a ten-year flood). On Monday, June 3, the Elbe quickly receded, and SPA 3 was canceled after 3 p.m., SPA 1 after 9 p.m. Another limnigraph in Brod recorded SPA 1 (300 cm) at 4 a.m., SPA 3 (370 cm) around 7:30 a.m., and the water level continued to rise, reaching 470 cm and 140 m³/s at 5 p.m., which meant a five-year flood. This level was maintained by the Elbe until Monday morning, after which it began to drop rapidly, and on the morning of June 4, 2013, the water level fell below SPA 1."

                "content": "The Úpa River narrowly avoided the declaration of the third flood stage (SPA) in its upper course: after an extreme 123 mm of rainfall fell in the Horní Maršov area during the night of June 1-2 within 24 hours, smaller tributaries of the Úpa almost reached tropical proportions, causing landslides and flooding the Maršov square. The Úpa River in Horní Maršov reached a water level of 157 cm with a flow rate of 53 m³/s (just under a five-year flood; the limit for the third SPA here is 160 cm) on June 2 at 2 a.m., and although the level dropped to 97 cm two hours later, a new peak occurred the same day at noon at 152 cm / 51 m³/s, after which the level dropped again almost to normal. Volunteer firefighters from the village, who ironically had celebrated the 140th anniversary of their brigade the day before, organized rescue operations during the night, including moving cars, clearing blocked bridges, etc. In the Lysečinský stream, they even searched for a shepherd swept away by water along with a piece of meadow from which he tried to save a tied goat – he survived with injuries. A few kilometers downstream in Svoboda nad Úpou, however, the situation was much worse: the same all-night downpour that caused a flash flood in Rudník and Hostinné also washed away several tourist trails on the slopes of Černá hora (e.g., a two-kilometer section of the cobbled Zvonková trail to a depth of up to 120 cm) and sent a landslide directly into the Černohorský stream. The water and stones first \"excavated\" the streambed in Těsný důl and its banks to a height of about three meters, clearing decades-old deposits, then gained high speed in the regulated section of the stream along the road. Water, sand, and smaller pebbles acted as perfect sliding bearings for ton-sized stone blocks, so this torrent destroyed everything in its path to the Úpa, including stone walls and several small bridges. At the site near the Prom Hotel, where the streambed begins to be covered, the boulders lost speed and quickly got stuck, with gaps between them clogged by finer material, causing the stream to find a new path not only through the hotel grounds but also along the recently repaired road II/297, which partially turned into a new streambed in the section between Janské Lázně and Svoboda nad Úpou. The connecting road II/296 to Trutnov was also damaged, and dozens of properties were affected, with Svoboda's mayor Jiří Špetla estimating damages at tens of millions of crowns at the time. Clearing the blocked covered streambed in Svoboda took about three days, with the greatest credit going to amateur cavers who uncovered the deposits from below and managed to loosen the stone blocks enough to be pulled away by heavy machinery using cables. Several dozen kilometers downstream in Zlíč, where the Úpa transitions from a mountainous to a flatter region, the river exceeded its first SPA (130 cm) at 3 a.m., the third SPA (210 cm) before 6 a.m., and peaked at 220 cm / 77 m³/s (a two-year flood) around 10 p.m. on Sunday. It returned below the first SPA only on Wednesday after 8 p.m. Flood waves from the Elbe and Úpa rivers met at their confluence in Jaroměř, where the Elbe peaked at 370 cm / 240 m³/s (a ten-year flood) after midnight on June 3, while the Úpa contributed 77 m³/s at the same time, and the Metuje added its share of 73 m³/s (although it exceeded the first SPA on the Hronov and Krčín limnigraphs on Sunday by a maximum of 10 cm and for no more than 12 hours). However, all rivers dropped relatively quickly during Monday. This surge of water in Jaroměř caused the historic steel bridge from 1884 to collapse, as the Elbe undermined one of its pillars during the night on Monday, breaking the bridge, with one side walkway even falling into the water and being recovered with two heavy cranes only on Monday evening. The rest of the bridge was demolished during June and July. A new bridge was opened in March 2015."

The Jizera River itself traditionally posed a threat, especially in Jablonec nad Jizerou, where the 1st flood stage (150 cm) was exceeded on Saturday evening, June 1, and the 3rd flood stage (210 cm) was reached on Sunday between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., with a peak at 218 cm / 100 m³/s.

On Monday morning, the water level slightly exceeded the 2nd flood stage, with the Labe peaking at noon at 415 cm / 340 m³/s. By Tuesday morning, June 4, it had dropped below the 1st flood stage. Similarly, in Přelouč, the 1st flood stage (240 cm) was exceeded on Sunday around 3:00 PM and was lifted on Tuesday afternoon, with the peak occurring on Monday afternoon at 295 cm / 320 m³/s. At both locations, this represented less than a two-year flood. However, several dozen kilometers further, the left-bank tributary of the Labe, Vrchlice, exceeded the 1st flood stage (105 cm) on Sunday after 11:00 AM, the 3rd flood stage (130 cm) was exceeded after noon, and the peak at 184 cm / 36 m³/s (a fifty-year flood) occurred after 7:00 PM. By Tuesday morning, the river had dropped below the 1st flood stage. \n\nThe situation was more serious with the Výrovka stream, which in Plaňany exceeded the 1st flood stage (150 cm) after 9:00 AM and the 3rd flood stage (250 cm) after noon. On Sunday at 8:00 PM, it peaked at 453 cm / 122 m³/s (the hundred-year flood threshold here is 75 m³/s), and by Tuesday before noon, it had dropped below the 3rd flood stage, and by Thursday before 9:00 AM, it was below the 1st flood stage. \n\nProbably the worst situation was caused by the Mrlina stream above Nymburk: at the Vestec limnigraph, it exceeded the 1st flood stage (150 cm) on Sunday before noon and the 3rd flood stage (240 cm) after 8:00 PM. At 10:00 PM, the 3rd flood stage limit (271 cm) was also exceeded, and shortly after midnight on Monday, it reached 310 cm, which it maintained for several dozen hours. The peak occurred on Tuesday morning, June 4, at 314 cm and 85 m³/s (almost a hundred-year flood). Due to the threat of dam breaches in local ponds, a complete evacuation of residents was ordered in the village of Vestec, and later in the villages of Budiměřice, Křinec, Rašovice, and Šlotava. The Mrlina then receded relatively quickly, leaving the 3rd flood stage on Wednesday before noon and the 1st flood stage on Thursday before midnight. \n\nIn Brandýs nad Labem, the water level rose relatively slowly. The 1st flood stage (280 cm) was surpassed early Sunday morning, with the peak in the 2nd flood stage range occurring on Tuesday, June 4, between 6:00 and 9:00 AM at 430 cm / 670 m³/s – roughly five times less than the Vltava at the same time. Nevertheless, preparations for the flood began in places like Neratovice and especially at the local chemical plant Spolana. During the 2002 floods, unexpected problems were caused not by the Labe itself but by its confluence with the Vltava – the overwhelming Vltava waters caused the \"stopping\" of the Labe's flow and its subsequent backflow, which significantly endangered places like Neratovice, located about 7 km above the confluence. During the 2013 floods, Spolana therefore preemptively halted production and, for example, moved chlorine and other substances to safety over the weekend."

In Mělník itself, the 1st flood stage (Elbe water level 400 cm) was declared at the turn of Saturday and Sunday, reaching the 3rd flood stage (550 cm) by the evening of Sunday, June 2, and the water level continued to rise steeply. The peak occurred on Wednesday, June 5, 2013, when the Elbe maintained a level of 930 cm from midnight until 7 a.m., with a flow rate exceeding 3900 m³/s, corresponding to more than a fifty-year flood. The inner part of Mělník was not threatened, but the high water flooding properties affected, for example, the local part of Mlazice. The receding flood from the Vltava allowed the 3rd flood stage to be lifted only on Monday, June 10, after 2 a.m., when the flow rate dropped below a two-year flood level, and the 1st flood stage was definitively canceled on Friday, June 14, after midnight. The flood gradually moved downstream. In Litoměřice, as with every flood, the area at the confluence of the Elbe and Ohře rivers (both rivers were flooded) was completely submerged, and the Tyrš Bridge was out of service because water flooded its left approach in Želetice, and the nearby left-bank village of Mlékojedy was also flooded. The new František Chábera road bridge remained fully operational. The water flooded not only the town of Terezín and its surroundings but also, on Wednesday, June 5, water from the Ohře penetrated its former riverbed in the fields into the village of Nové Kopisty, where it breached a temporarily built field embankment and reached beyond the main railway line from Prague to Děčín. In the Litoměřice area, the water completely overflowed the mobile flood barriers in the village of Křešice. The Litoměřice limnigraph below the Ohře inflow had to be disconnected from the power supply due to high water, so data from it was unavailable, but the limnigraph in Ústí nad Labem continued to operate and recorded the gradual rise in water level and flow rate – by midnight on Monday, June 3, it was already in the 3rd flood stage zone (water level above 600 cm), and the water kept rising. Due to the flooding of the left-bank four-lane road (carrying important roads I/30 and I/62), the Mariánský Bridge was first closed, and after surpassing the 800 cm mark, the Beneš Bridge was also closed, leaving the two parts of the city connected only via the old railway bridge, where motor units operated in a 10–15 minute shuttle between the Ústí nad Labem – Střekov and Ústí nad Labem – west stations for several days. The main Ústí nad Labem railway station was out of service due to the flooding of the ground-floor ticket hall and the entire forecourt area. On Wednesday, June 5, after surpassing the 10 m mark, the water breached the flood walls in the Střekov district and flooded residential houses there. The Elbe's peak occurred on the night of Wednesday, June 5, to Thursday, June 6, at a level of 10.8 m, with an instantaneous flow rate exceeding 3700 m³/s, and despite the catastrophic consequences for Ústí nad Labem, it was not yet a fifty-year flood (the 3rd flood stage threshold was just two centimeters away, and in 2002, up to 4700 m³/s flowed here). The water then receded very slowly as the flow rates from the upper Elbe, Vltava, Ohře, and Bílina decreased: the 3rd flood stage could only be lifted at midnight from Wednesday, June 12, to Thursday, June 13, the 2nd flood stage on Friday morning, June 14, and finally, the 1st flood stage on Saturday, June 15, after 4 p.m. Děčín was, of course, also affected, although the flood wave was progressing more slowly. The peak in Děčín occurred roughly three hours after the one in Ústí. Firefighters, with all their strength and full human and technical deployment, managed to keep the bridge on road I/13 operational."

This water rushed towards Frýdlant in Bohemia, which experienced the first wave without a flood state, but declared the 1st SPA (130 cm) on Sunday evening and subsequently recorded the first peak at 153 cm / 64 m³/s, and the second on Monday morning at 157 cm / 66 m³/s. However, the flood was called off the same evening. In Frýdlant, the Smědá is joined by the Řasnice, which reached a flow of 19 m³/s on Monday noon, and these combined waters flowed through Višňová into Poland. Together with the collected rainfall from the entire basin, this meant that the 1st SPA (200 cm) was declared in this village already on Saturday around 7 p.m., and even the 3rd SPA (240 cm) was reached before midnight. Over the following hours, four peak waves followed, the first (270 cm / 72 m³/s) on Sunday morning, and the third and strongest (282 cm / 89 m³/s) on Monday at 12:00, but even here the two-year water level was not exceeded. The Smědá returned to normal on Tuesday afternoon. The Černá Nisa in Rudolfov did not exceed a flow of 6 m³/s, which is ten times the normal level, and the Lužická Nisa in Liberec reached the 1st SPA (85 cm) on Sunday, June 2, in the morning and peaked after noon at 117 cm / 22 m³/s, returning to normal on Tuesday, June 4, in the afternoon. The Jeřice, which flows into the Lužická Nisa in Chrastava, was significantly more swollen despite the retention capacity of the Fojtka reservoir: in Mníšek, the 1st SPA (60 cm) was declared on Saturday around 9 p.m., but after the reservoir filled, the Jeřice rose above the 3rd SPA (100 cm) on Sunday afternoon, although the peak of 155 cm / 6.5 m³ did not even represent a one-year water level. Here too, the water returned to normal on Tuesday morning. The Lužická Nisa in Hrádek nad Nisou reached the 1st SPA (175 cm) on Saturday around 8 p.m. and then peaked twice in the 2nd SPA range (above 210 cm), first on Sunday around 8 p.m. and again on Monday around 9 a.m., each time at 220 cm / 79 m³/s (not reaching the five-year water level).

The rainfall intensified, taking the form of a \"cloudburst\" on the afternoon of August 21. At rainfall measurement stations, the following amounts were recorded: in Jarnołtówek – 61.5 mm, in Trzebina – 80.7 mm, in Prudnik – 117 mm. Lesser rainfall was recorded at stations in Głogówek, Głuchołazy, Nowy Świętów, Wierzbięcice, Ścinawa Mała, and Korfantów[1]. The record water flow in the Prudnik River occurred in the afternoon and evening of August 21 and the morning of August 22. A rapid rise in water levels was noted in the tributaries of the Prudnik River, mainly in Potoczyń. On August 21 at 4:00 PM, the alarm level was exceeded at the water gauge in Prudnik. At 8:00 PM, the highest level in the history of this water gauge was recorded – 476 cm. Part of the water overflowed the riverbanks near Chrobrego Street and flowed through Kolejowa, Wiejska, Morcinka, and Konopnicka Streets, returning to the riverbed about half a kilometer further[1]. The course of the flood was rapid. \"Trybuna Odrzańska\" published a statement from a farmer in Szybowice: \"It all lasted no longer than 20 minutes. Before I realized the stream was rising, the yard was already full of water. I ran outside to catch the chickens and let the pigs out of the sty.\" The farmer's wife added: \"When I was leaving the barn, the water swept me away and threw me against the fence. Holding onto it, I slowly made my way to the neighbor's house. I didn’t manage to let the pigs out, and they were carried away. The water was so high that they floated over the cage fences...\"[1] Father Marcin Bajer from Niemysłowice described the flood: \"The sky was exceptionally black. (...) Within half an hour of the downpour, people who had entered the church could not leave. A great torrent of water flowed through the stream and the road. People were helpless; no one expected this on such a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The water level kept rising, pouring through windows into houses, flooding floors, furniture, and equipment. Panic gripped people; the water carried geese, chickens, ducks, pigs. (...) It was a biblical flood on a small scale. Many families suffered very great damage and material losses. (...) A similar disaster struck Czyżowice, Prudnik, and Szybowice. The road to the city was closed. (...) The hand of the Lord touched us\"[2]."

The low-pressure system formed due to a significant thermal contrast between warm Mediterranean air masses and cold air from the Alps. It was characterized by warm and humid air from the Mediterranean moving northward and, upon colliding with the Alps, forcing these air masses upward. In the river basins flowing through Poland, the heaviest rainfall from September 12–15 occurred in the northern and northwestern parts of the Jeseníky Mountains and the Golden Mountains in the Czech Republic. At meteorological stations in this region, the recorded rainfall totals were: Rejvíz – 517 mm, Červenohorské sedlo – 474 mm, Jeseník – 465 mm, Zlaté Hory – 416 mm, Staré Město pod Sněžníkem – 413 mm. Most of this rainfall occurred on September 14, with daily totals exceeding 200 mm at some stations. Extremely heavy rainfall also occurred near Ostrava (approximately 300 mm). Rainfall in the Eastern Sudetes region and throughout the Czech Republic was also intense, for example, in Opava, where the total rainfall during this period exceeded 200 mm. In Poland, the highest recorded rainfall at a measurement station was on Śnieżnik, with 400 mm and 472 mm according to the RainGRS system. In the northern part of the Eastern Sudetes and the foothills on the Czech-Polish border (south of the Paczków–Prudnik line), rainfall during this time exceeded 200 mm. At the turn of September and October, a second Genoa low formed, causing prolonged heavy rainfall in southern Europe and flooding in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Albania."

On September 11, IMGW issued a meteorological warning about floods and inundations caused by rainfall exceeding 150 mm locally from September 12 to 15 in the Lower Silesian, Opole, and Silesian Voivodeships. On September 11, the Czech Ministry of the Interior stated in a press release that the situation would be similar to the floods of 1997 and 2002. The ministry reported preparations, including increased outflow from retention reservoirs. The heaviest rainfall was forecasted in the Jeseníky Mountains, with 400 mm in the optimistic scenario and 450 mm in the pessimistic scenario. The press release included maps of total rainfall for September 11–15. In the pessimistic scenario, the highest rainfall totals were expected to be 330 mm in the Pardubice Region, 310 mm in the Jelenia Góra Basin area, 300 mm in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids, and 300 mm on the Czech-Austrian border near České Budějovice. On September 12, IMGW-PIB forecasted up to 300 mm of rainfall. According to the September 12 forecast, the level of the Biała Głuchołaska River in Głuchołazy was expected to reach 3.2 m on September 14, exceeding the alarm level by 2 meters according to the HBV hydrological model. The first IMGW bulletin on September 13 included a forecast of \"maximum rainfall totals from 250 to 400 mm in the Nysa Kłodzka basin, and from 200 to 300 mm in the Mała Wisła basin.\" The bulletin also included water level forecasts until 8:00 PM on September 15, according to which the Nysa Kłodzka level in the Opole Voivodeship was expected to be moderate, the lower course of the Biała Głuchołaska high, and the Bóbr River level was not expected to exceed warning levels. On September 13, the spokesperson for RZGW in Wrocław stated that there was no need to increase the flood reserve in the Nysa Kłodzka cascade, as it was sufficient in the context of the forecasted rainfall. The same amount of water was flowing out of Lake Nyskie as was flowing in. On that day at 6:00 AM, all water reservoirs in the cascade were below normal levels by a total of 48 million m³. Wody Polskie issued a statement on September 18 that on September 13, meteorological and hydrological forecasts had changed significantly, but floodwaters were still expected to remain within river channels."

In the evening, it was also announced that the Polish government would seek maximum financial aid from the European Union to address the flood's aftermath. According to authorities, the EU has a special assistance mechanism for such situations. From that day, reports began to emerge about the completely destroyed historic St. John Bridge in Lądek-Zdrój. However, it turned out that the Gothic bridge over the Biała Lądecka River survived the flood waves but was in a critical structural condition and still at risk of collapse. The statue of St. John of Nepomuk adorning the bridge was lost. In Prudnik, the water destroyed three pedestrian bridges: a footbridge in the garden allotment complex over the Złoty Potok, and footbridges under Czyżykowa Góra and Piaskówka over the Prudnik River."

Since Sunday, the Racibórz Dolny reservoir has been operating, aiming to flatten the flood wave coming from Ostrava in the Czech Republic towards Wrocław as much as possible. By September 17 at 4:00 PM, it had taken in 147 million m³ of water (about 80% of its capacity at that time, while the neighboring Buków Polder retained an additional 50 million m³ of water), after which it began to be slowly emptied. Shortly after midnight, a decision was also made to evacuate the entire town of Lewin Brzeski, located on the Nysa Kłodzka, after the embankments were breached and water began entering the town. The river level near the town exceeded 780 cm. Evacuations were also ordered in nearby villages. Wody Polskie reported a minor water leak in the forefield of the Racibórz Dolny reservoir, which, however, did not threaten the operation of the reservoir's inlet and outlet mechanisms. The Municipal Crisis Management Team in Kędzierzyn-Koźle decided to prepare for the potential evacuation of three districts of Kędzierzyn-Koźle: Rogów, Zachód, and Południe. In the city, efforts were also underway to raise embankments in Lasoki (Rogi district) and to set up protective sleeves over the Lineta stream at the height of Emilii Plater Street. On that day, the flood had already reached the Lubusz Voivodeship and, through the Bóbr and Szprotawa rivers, flooded Szprotawa in the Żagań County. The water also posed a threat to another nearby town, Żagań. During a crisis meeting around 6:55 PM with the participation of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, it was reported that in Żagań, the alarm level on the local river had been exceeded by 178 cm. This level was also exceeded in Łozy, located on the Kwisa River."

The most critical situation is in South Moravia, followed by Central and Northern Moravia, and South Bohemia. Four people were reported missing, thousands were displaced, and about 250,000 people were without power. Several roads and railway lines were closed. Water also leaked into the Museum metro station, but it remained operational. The Husinec dam in the South Bohemian region overflowed on September 15, and water began spilling over the dam's crest. Around noon on September 16, information emerged about damage to the right bank of the flood embankment in Ostrava. This is a very dangerous incident, as no flood plans accounted for this event. An urgent evacuation of residents from areas at risk of flooding was immediately ordered. A crane arrived at the site to place sandbags in the gap. The water is heading toward chemical plants and a coking plant, which could lead to catastrophic consequences and an even greater tragedy. At this point, about 2,500 residents have been evacuated from the Ostrava area. Railway routes Bohumin – Ostrava and Ostrava – Ostrava Svinov, including access from the Polish border crossings Chałupki and Zebrzydowice to the Czech Republic, are also impassable. It may take at least a week to restore railway traffic at the Ostrava railway junction. The mountain resort of Malá Úpa in the Trutnov District in the Krkonoše Mountains has been completely cut off from the outside world due to a mudslide. On September 17, after 10:00, no location was under an \"extreme flood danger\" alert anymore. Only standard third-degree flood alerts remained.

On September 14, 24 towns in the districts of Horn, Krems, Tulln, and Zwettl were classified as disaster areas due to the high water levels in the Kamp River. That same evening, the area was expanded to include 18 more towns. Early in the morning on September 15, the government of the federal state of Lower Austria announced that the entire state was now under a state of disaster. In many places, it was necessary to evacuate residents. Numerous streams, such as the Perschling or the Vienna River, overflowed their banks, also forcing evacuations in Vienna. At 10:00 local time, it was reported that a firefighter had died, the first fatality from the floods in the country. On September 15, the Danube in the Austrian capital overflowed its banks and flooded many areas. Due to the severe weather conditions caused by storms and their aftermath, about 25,000 households in Styria were without electricity. The worst situation in this region was in the valleys of the Mürz and Salza rivers. On the evening of September 15, the city of Kapfenberg, located on the Mürz, was underwater. On Monday, September 16, three more fatalities were reported in Lower Austria. In the morning, 256 national roads, including parts of highways, were closed. Rail traffic was also heavily affected. Dam breaches, particularly near St. Pölten, placed a significant burden on local services. This led to the complete evacuation of the village of Rust im Tullnerfeld, with about 600 residents, due to fears of a massive influx of water from the Perschling River. After 6:00 PM on September 17, it was reported that five people had died as a result of the floods in Lower Austria. Many towns, however, remain cut off from the world. According to Austrian police, the tragedy occurred in the town of Tulln an der Donau."

On the same day, in Thammamun Subdistrict, Mueang Chai Nat District, Chai Nat Province, located north of the Chao Phraya Dam, water from the Chao Phraya River overflowed into Moo 4, Thammamun Subdistrict, as the earthen embankment used as a flood barrier collapsed. Authorities were unable to bring machinery, tools, or sandbags to seal the breach, resulting in flooding of residential and agricultural areas, affecting over 100 households."

                "content": "Many chroniclers remember the events of this flood. The most famous of all is Giovanni Villani, who was an eyewitness and reported that from November 1st there was a great deluge of water, which poured over Florence and all of Tuscany for four days and four nights. The river level rose rapidly and began to overflow already in the Casentino, the plain of Arezzo, and the Upper Valdarno. At the gates of Florence, at the confluence with the Sieve - a river that had also flooded the Mugello area - the Arno was already extremely high, and on November 4th (coincidentally the same date as the 1966 flood) it inundated the San Salvi and Bisarno areas, reaching a height of ten braccia (almost six meters). In the evening, the waters broke the embankment wall near the Corso dei Tintori, severely flooding the Santa Croce area, then reaching San Pier Scheraggio, San Pier Maggiore, and even the Duomo's gate. We know that in the Baptistery of San Giovanni, the water reached almost to the matronea and covered halfway up the porphyry columns beside the central portal; in the church of Santa Reparata, it reached the vaults and caused the nearby column of San Zanobi to collapse; in the Badia Fiorentina and Santa Croce, it submerged the central altar. In the inner courtyard of Palazzo Vecchio, the water reached six braccia in height, more than three meters. At Vespers, the waters broke the Ognissanti weir and caused the collapse of the Ponte alla Carraia, leaving only two arches on the north side. The second bridge to collapse was the Ponte Santa Trinita, of which only one pier and an arch on the side of the church of the same name remained. The third was the Ponte Vecchio, which had been rebuilt about 150 years earlier after the 1177 flood, and in the collapse, the statue of Mars positioned on a pillar at the bridge's entrance, at the corner of Via Por Santa Maria, was also lost. The statue, also mentioned by Dante in the thirteenth canto of the Inferno (v. 144), had already been swept away by previous river floods but, although damaged, had been recovered and placed back to guard the Arno to protect the city. However, during the 1333 flood, it was no longer recovered from the waters, and its destruction was seen as a forewarning of future misfortunes. The only bridge to withstand was the Ponte di Rubaconte (the current Ponte alle Grazie), although damaged by the collapse of its parapets, while the nearby Altafronte castle was destroyed. The flood caused severe damage in the countryside as well, in Brozzi, Campi Bisenzio, Signa, the Prato countryside, the lower Valdarno, and Empoli, which lost its walls, all the way to Pisa. When the waters finally receded, streets, houses, cellars, and shops were invaded by foul-smelling mud, and it took more than six months of work for cleanup operations; wells were damaged and had to be dug anew and deeper; there was also damage to crops, mills, and ovens, causing a shortage of food supplies, mitigated by aid received from surrounding cities such as Pistoia, Poggibonsi, and Prato. According to Villani, the confirmed human victims were about three hundred, and a vast amount of livestock was lost. The damage to homes, public buildings, and road infrastructure, especially the bridges, in the city of Florence was estimated at more than 150,000 florins."

The author, a firsthand witness to the disaster, identified its fundamental cause in the unbridled desire for wealth of the Florentines. Over the years, they had exploited the course of the Arno River by constructing numerous docks that were meant to ensure, along with the bridges providing connectivity between the two banks, a road and river network essential for the activities carried out upstream and downstream of its bed. Mills, fulling mills, and weirs (at the time placed on large wooden rafts anchored to the riverbanks) were also built to facilitate water supply during dry periods. One of the causes of the disaster was attributed precisely to the multitude of these productive structures along the river's course: it was believed that, together with the weirs that fed them and the bridges, they had hindered the free flow of the river. A few centuries later, Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti also mentioned the flood of 1333. The Florentine scholar wrote in 1767 to Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany in the \"Examination of some projects made in the 16th century to save Florence from the floods of the Arno,\" regarding the river, the problems related to its bed, and its floods such as the disastrous flood of 1333: \"many times it has caused, and will increasingly cause in the future, the Arno River, its [Florence's] discontented and treacherous guest (...) but what is worse, with the constructions its natural bed was usurped and disrupted (...) on November 4, 1333, swollen with water and almost indignant at the constraints in which the good Florentines intended to keep it, delivering a furious blow to the Ponte Vecchio and the other two bridges of S. Trinita and Carraia, it destroyed them and carried them away along with the Ognissanti weir; then, to regain possession of its ancient and proper bed (...).\""

This event occurred due to an isolated depression at high levels (DANA), which caused intense rainfall in the region, estimated at more than a thousand liters per square meter in a few hours. The overflowing waters of the Segura flooded much of the valley, causing severe damage in towns such as Murcia, Orihuela, Molíns, Algorfa, Almoradí, Benijófar, Rojales, and Guardamar del Segura. The impact of the flood was devastating. It is estimated that at least a thousand people died, mainly in areas located near the riverbed, due to the collapse of houses and the sweeping away of people by the strong current."

Unlike previous occasions, there was no time for a general alert or the activation of a parish emergency organization, and the defenses, already weakened by a previous flood on September 20, were in critical condition. The force of this flood far exceeded the previous one, breaking the dikes and defensive structures that still remained. The storm began to unleash its force at three in the morning. Shortly after, the waters of the Segura, Mula, Guadalentín rivers, and the Nogalte and Sangonera ravines converged, increasing the flow of the Segura River and causing a violent surge that swept away everything in its path. The current broke dikes and the river's weir, in addition to causing severe damage to the Malecón. Buildings located near the river were flooded, forcing the evacuation of several convents, such as San Agustín and those of the nuns of Verónica and the Mother of God. The material damage was immense. In Murcia, the flood destroyed the parishes of San Antolín, Santa Eulalia, San Juan, San Lorenzo, San Miguel, and San Andrés, and demolished hundreds of houses. The cathedral also suffered the onslaught of the waters, which entered during the celebration of a mass, forcing the officiant to take refuge in the tower with the Blessed Sacrament. Although nearly a thousand deaths were reported, mainly in neighborhoods and hamlets near the river's course, other estimates suggest that the deaths numbered several hundred. The waters reached heights of up to three stadia, remaining at that level for hours. At nine in the morning, after a brief respite in the rains, the river level continued to rise until three in the afternoon, that is, twelve hours after the storm began."

                "content": "Once the flood had subsided, the Murcia City Council focused on two urgent priorities: repairing the city's defenses to prevent a future catastrophe and cleaning the water and mud accumulated in the streets. The presence of stagnant water raised concerns about possible outbreaks of diseases. During the first three days after the flood, the water level remained high, and although it later began to recede, the city's streets remained flooded due to a change in the course of the Segura River, which now flowed through the city via the broken weir. To divert the water flow, a commission was sent, which decided to break the counter-weir on October 28, helping to drain the city. The repair of the Malecón, one of the key defenses, was essential. To ensure its prompt reconstruction, the City Council required all citizens to participate in the work or hire someone to do it on their behalf, with jurors organizing the work groups. This order caused discontent among the hidalgos, who resisted performing physical labor, claiming that their privileges exempted them from such obligations. However, the City Council responded that, in the face of the emergency, no one was exempt, as there were no \"privileges to avoid the risks and damages of the flood.\" Even the Count of Castro and other councilors hired people in their place to support the work. To reassure the nobility, the City Council clarified that participating in the reconstruction of the dyke did not harm their privileges, as it was a \"virtue\" in service of the public good and the protection of the city. This act reflects a more modern perspective of the time: although the system of privileges was accepted and defended, in the face of extreme necessity, the common good could prevail, albeit without affecting the essence of those privileges. Among the testimonies of the time is that of María Ángela Astorch, a Barcelonan nun of converso origin and abbess of the Capuchins of Murcia, who described in detail the effects of the flood in a memorial addressed to King Philip IV. In her writing, Astorch denounced the state of ruin and misery in which the region had been left. The flood occurred at a critical moment, as the Segura Valley was recovering from a deep economic crisis, worsened by the expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609. However, despite the magnitude of the tragedy, the Spanish Crown did not allocate aid for the recovery of the territory."

The Vistula River overflowed its banks. Along its course, ice floes carried away elements of homes, railway lines, and bridges. Near Modlin, ice jams were broken up using artillery. On the section of the river from Warsaw to Włocławek, a strip 3-5 km wide along its course was flooded. In Włocławek, the river level rose by three meters. Fatalities were reported in this area. In the vicinity of Toruń, despite attempts to prevent it, water overflowed, flooding the Ciechocinek valley. In the Gdańsk region, railway traffic operated through water. Bydgoszcz was flooded. The Lviv-Warsaw railway line was out of service due to the destruction of railway embankments. In addition to the Vistula, the Brda, Narew, San, Warta, Dniester, and Prut rivers also overflowed. Across the country, many bridges were destroyed, and embankments were undermined."

It was the longest heat wave experienced in Argentina since the heat wave in 2013, affecting especially the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba, and all the northern provinces where multiple cities recorded record temperatures. It was characterized as an unusual heat phenomenon, not only because of the duration of the event but also because of the magnitude of temperatures during the month it occurred, as in March in Argentina, temperatures tend to drop due to the beginning of autumn. The heat wave is associated with the Atlantic anticyclone, a new extremely intense La Niña phenomenon in the Pacific, and the regional effects of climate change. A heat wave is characterized by a marked and sustained increase in temperatures, especially the maximums, occurring in several cities, above what is considered extreme."

The Weather Office stated at the time that higher temperatures and more thunderstorms are expected due to climate change. During June 2023, the sea off the west coast of Ireland was 5 degrees Celsius warmer than usual, a major concern for scientists. In August 2023, the Killybegs Fishermen's Federation expressed concern about the impact of climate change on white fish stocks such as cod, and the risk that with a significant change in sea temperature off the coast of Donegal, fish such as cod, haddock, and herring would move to cooler waters further north. It was warm in Ireland during September. The people of the Corca Dhuibhne Gaeltacht were surprised when drops of soot from the Sahara fell on them."

As a result, water mills stopped working, so grain could not be ground and bread could not be baked. Occasionally, \"bad weather\" brought some relief, but also fatal fires. Rivers dried up, and in Cologne, the Rhine also ran dry. In Paris, people walked across the bed of the Seine without getting their feet wet. Forest and heath fires were a daily occurrence, but village centers and even some cities also caught fire. It was exceptionally dry and hot: between March and August, there was hardly any rain, and especially from April to July, it was extremely warm. In July, not a single drop fell in several places. In many areas, people began planting grapes for wine. But this was not successful, as three bad summers followed this warm one. Even after the summer, the sunny, warm, and dry weather continued. Even in October 1540, the sun and warmth returned, and apart from a few brief rain showers, it remained dry and sunny until the end of the year."

An initial heatwave hit the western regions of the country from June 25, with temperatures nearing or exceeding 40°C locally in Montana, Washington State, Arizona, Nevada, and California. In the following days, the phenomenon intensified, and record temperatures were recorded in southern Nevada and western Arizona. On July 5, 43°C was recorded in Reno, breaking the previous record from 1970, while 47°C was recorded in Las Vegas. A peak temperature was recorded in Baker, California, where the mercury rose to 51°C. In Las Vegas, as in several other cities in the region, the intensive use of air conditioners caused a series of power surges on the electrical grid, leaving entire neighborhoods without power. In Reno, the Salvation Army opened an emergency shelter for people without air conditioners. A one-year-old child found dead in a car in Orofino, Idaho, was one of the first victims of the heatwave to be reported. The drought and extreme temperatures caused several fires. In Utah, 1,150 km² of vegetation were destroyed by flames, forcing authorities to evacuate some homes and close access to highways I-15 and I-70. Three people died as a result of the disaster. After a period of relative respite, a new heatwave hit the country starting on July 9, this time reaching the Midwest plains, the South, and part of the East Coast. States like Tennessee and Missouri were particularly affected by the phenomenon, with temperatures nearing 40°C recorded in several localities. On July 11, 37.7°C was recorded in some areas of New Jersey. To limit accidents, the New York City municipality decided to open nearly 300 air-conditioned emergency centers. On August 16, Tennessee authorities announced a death toll of nine, while the Missouri Department of Health reported seven victims. In Illinois, eight people died as a result of this heatwave."

During 1947, temperatures were consistently above average from April to early October. Europe experienced three notable heatwaves (21 days): from June 26 to 28 (low intensity), from July 22 to August 4 (exceptional intensity), and from August 14 to 20 (moderate intensity). The spring had been abnormally warm, with unusual temperatures as early as April, as 30°C was reached in many regions of France during the second half of the month, and even exceeded in the south. On May 27, Saharan air swept over France with temperatures exceeding 30°C in the northern half and approaching 35°C in the southern part. After a respite in mid-June, a first heatwave hit Europe during the last decade of June. In France, between June 26 and 28, temperatures exceeded 35°C across much of the country. After a break in mid-July, a new heatwave—comparable to the August 2003 heatwave—occurred from July 22 to August 4. According to Météo-France, it was \"the most intense heatwave episode since the post-war period, after the August 2003 heatwave,\" and even since 1873, the year when Météo-France's chronological data began. In some places, such as the Paris region, absolute records were observed: on July 28, 1947, temperatures reached 40.4°C. This record would only be broken 72 years later, on July 25, 2019, with 42.6°C. \n\nIn southern France, the peak of the heatwave was reached on August 2 and 3, with 40°C in Lyon and even higher temperatures further south. On August 3 and 4, storms brought an end to this heatwave. However, a new, more moderate heatwave occurred between August 14 and 20: temperatures again exceeded 35°C across France, except along the coasts. A final heatwave took place during the second decade of September, with maximum temperatures still exceeding 30°C in most weather stations. In 1947, the heat was certainly less concentrated than in 2003, and the humanitarian consequences were less critical for a population less exposed. However, the episodes of intense heat in 1947 were never as widespread since the beginning of records. The Alpine glacier systems recorded historic losses, which they would not recover from thereafter."

                "content": "The heatwave of July 1994 was the most significant heatwave of the 1990s and the most important since the heatwave of July 1982. Central Catalonia, mainly Bages and Berguedà, was the area that suffered the most from the catastrophic forest fires, burning nearly 45,000 hectares, and where the highest temperature values in Catalonia were recorded. The heatwave began in the last days of June, reaching its peak between July 3 and 5. It affected all of Catalonia but was especially intense in the Terres de Ponent, Central Catalonia, the pre-coastal area, and the pre-Pyrenean valleys of Pallars Jussà and Alt Urgell. In these areas, thermometers soared above 40°C, a value rarely reached in Catalonia and not every summer. On July 4, 1994, 43.0°C was recorded in Montblanc and Esparreguera, and 42.5°C in Manresa and Piera. Even in elevated areas of the Pyrenees, temperatures reached very high values, such as 25°C on July 1 at the 2,041-meter altitude of the Boí-Taüll ski resort. A new, less intense heatwave returned to affect all of Catalonia in mid-month, with maximum temperatures again reaching 40°C in the hottest parts of the country, but this time especially affecting the northeastern counties and the Central Coast, where sea breezes had tempered the temperature during the first heatwave of the month. In these areas, the absolute maximum temperature of that month was then reached. During those days in July 1994, a bubble of very hot air of Saharan origin affected much of the Iberian Peninsula and the southwestern area of Europe, with temperatures at 850 hPa reaching 30°C over Andalusia, 25°C in the Ebro Valley, 22°C in the Pyrenees, and 20°C in the Alps between July 3 and 4, 1994. The entry of this very hot air mass was facilitated by a southern wind flow at all levels caused by a significant ridge at 500 hPa centered over the Alboran Sea and extending to Scandinavia. The following maps show the 20CRP (NCAR-NCEP, USA) reanalyses for 07/03/1994 at 18 UTC of the geopotential height and temperature fields at 500 hPa (upper image) and 850 hPa (central image), as well as the sea-level pressure and 2-meter temperature fields (lower image). The two heatwaves of July 1994 resulted in a significant thermal anomaly at 850 hPa over the Iberian Peninsula and much of Europe, as well as a significant positive anomaly in geopotential height at 850 hPa over Scandinavia. Monthly temperature values at 850 hPa exceeded 3.5°C above the climatic average for the 1948-2013 period over the Valencian Community and the Terres de l'Ebre, and exceeded 4°C in northern Germany. The average geopotential height field at 500 hPa also shows a clear dominance of southern wind circulation in Western Europe, thus favoring the entry of warm air from the Sahara into the Iberian Peninsula and Western Europe for much of the month. This configuration is very different from the predominant one during July across Western Europe, with a circulation of predominantly westerly winds. The winter and spring of 1994 had been very dry in much of the country. Accumulated precipitation was clearly below the climatic average, especially in spring (in Berguedà and Bages, it had rained half of what is usual). Therefore, at the beginning of the summer of 1994, the forests of Catalonia were in a state of significant water stress. The extremely high temperatures recorded in the interior of the country as a result of the great heatwave, combined with low humidity due to the moderately intense dry southern wind that blew during those days, facilitated the occurrence of the devastating forest fires in Catalonia in 1994."

                "content": "The heatwave in Australia in November 2009 was a period of seasonally extreme high temperatures that affected southeastern Australia in November 2009. It was the second massive heatwave to hit the region during 2009 (see Heatwave in Australia 2009), with the worst-affected states being South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. The heatwave at the turn of January-February 2009 was indeed even more intense, but according to the Australian weather service, it was unprecedented in terms of intensity so early in the summer season. In many places, record-high temperatures for November were measured, locally over 45 degrees C. But above all, it was the duration that made the heatwave unique. Temperatures of around 40 degrees C or more have indeed been recorded many times in November in the affected areas, but the heat has then only lasted a few days. In this case, many locations experienced such high temperatures for over a week, with daytime temperatures 10-15 degrees above normal. Just like during the heatwave 10 months earlier, the cause of the warm weather was a powerful, stationary high-pressure system over the Tasman Sea, which led to very warm air from central Australia flowing down over the southeastern part of the country. The winter of 2009 had been extremely warm in Australia, and very high temperatures were recorded in the region already at the end of October. However, the heatwave is considered to have started on November 6 and ended only on November 19-20."

A spokesperson for the environmental group Climate Emergency Action Network claimed that the current heatwave is a clear example of \"climate change weather,\" i.e., extreme weather events that can be expected as the climate becomes increasingly warmer. However, the weather service emphasized, as usual, that an unusually intense individual heatwave does not prove anything. On the other hand, they argue that it is indisputable that Australia has warmed faster than the global average and that heatwaves have become both more frequent and longer. Additionally, large parts of the continent have been affected by very severe drought during the 21st century."

In July, the heat affected the Nansei Islands, in August it centered on the inland areas of Honshu and extended from Hokkaido to Kyushu, and in September it impacted the entire country, particularly the Seto Inland Sea coastal areas and northern Kyushu. At the time, it was a record-breaking heatwave, but three years later, in 2010, temperatures significantly surpassed those of 2007, setting the highest temperatures in recorded history. As a result, the heatwave of 2007 became less prominent and faded from memory. Furthermore, 2011 recorded the fourth-highest summer average temperature, with August of the following year ranking third and September ranking first in high temperatures."

                "content": "The rainy season in 2007 tended to be delayed across Japan. The start of the rainy season was delayed nationwide, except for southern Kyushu, averaging 8.6 days later than usual, and the end of the rainy season was delayed by 5.4 days compared to the average, except for southern Kyushu and the Nansei Islands. Before the rainy season began, it was predicted that the rainy season would be short and the summer would be hot due to the effects of the La Niña phenomenon. However, in reality, the rainy season was delayed due to factors such as the weak influence of the Pacific high-pressure system. \n\nAs a result of the delayed rainy season, July saw low temperatures and heavy rainfall, except in southern Kyushu and the Nansei Islands, with average temperatures in Honshu and Hokkaido being 0.8-1.7°C lower than usual. However, after the rainy season ended and August began, the Pacific high-pressure system strengthened, leading to stable sunny weather and a shift from a trend of low temperatures to high temperatures. By mid-August, the number of locations observing extreme heat days with maximum temperatures of 35°C or higher rapidly increased from the Kanto region to Kyushu. On August 15, a temperature of 40.2°C was recorded in Tatebayashi City, Gunma Prefecture, marking the first time that year a temperature of 40°C or higher was observed. The following day, August 16, temperatures of 40.9°C were recorded in Kumagaya City, Saitama Prefecture, and Tajimi City, Gifu Prefecture, breaking the previous record of 40.8°C observed in Yamagata City, Yamagata Prefecture, on July 25, 1933, for the first time in 74 years. After this, temperatures began to drop gradually from the north, but high temperatures persisted until late August. The average monthly temperature for August was 0.6-1.3°C higher than usual across a wide area from Hokkaido to Kyushu, and about 0.3°C higher in the Nansei Islands. The average temperature for the entire summer (June to August) was 0-0.8°C higher than usual nationwide.\n\nFrom late August to early September, temperatures temporarily dropped due to autumn rains and Typhoon No. 9, but high temperatures continued in areas south of the autumn rain front. From mid-September onward, the autumn rain front weakened, and the Pacific high-pressure system and migratory high-pressure systems broadly covered the area around Japan, while the westerly jet stream meandered significantly northward near Japan. As a result, low rainfall and high temperatures persisted, and some regions experienced record-breaking heat for September. By late September, the heat subsided in areas north of the Hokuriku and Kanto regions due to the southward movement of the autumn rain front, but high temperatures continued in regions further south. The average monthly temperature for September was 0.4-0.8°C higher than usual in the Nansei Islands, 0.9°C higher in Hokkaido, 1.6-2.1°C higher in the Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, and Kinki regions, and 2.2-2.5°C higher in the Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu regions.\n\nAround mid-August, many people across Japan were hospitalized due to heatstroke. Dozens of deaths were reported, most of whom were elderly individuals staying at home, highlighting the issue of ensuring the health and safety of the elderly during extreme heat."

                "content": "The factors contributing to the intense heat in mid-August include the position and strength of the Pacific High, as well as the continuation of stable weather. It is believed that the Pacific High was shifted northeast compared to usual years, and in central Japan, which was near the center of the high-pressure system, a \"tall high-pressure system\" covered the area from the surface to the upper atmosphere. This was likely due to the La Niña phenomenon and sea surface temperature fluctuations in the Indian Ocean, which activated convective activity near the Philippines. Warm air rose actively near the Philippines, flowed into the vicinity of the Pacific High, descended, and strengthened the Pacific High while warming its interior. Additionally, the Tibetan High was shifted northward. The meandering of the subtropical jet stream (westerlies) caused it to flow northward near Japan, allowing the Pacific High and Tibetan High to extend significantly northward near Japan. The Tibetan High overlapped the Pacific High, broadly and deeply covering the area near Japan. This state persisted for about a week, preventing the heat accumulated during the day from fully dissipating at night, gradually raising the baseline temperature and creating the foundation for record-breaking heat. \n\nIn regions that experienced particularly high temperatures, geographical factors also played a significant role. Cities like Tajimi and Mino are located in basins, while Kumagaya and Tatebayashi are inland areas of plains surrounded by mountains, making them prone to temperature increases due to the Foehn effect. Additionally, areas situated in valleys surrounded by high mountains on two sides likely became heat traps due to converging winds. The heat island effect in the Chukyo and Tokyo metropolitan areas, as well as the obstruction of convection (such as sea and land breezes or mountain and valley winds) by skyscrapers acting as \"walls,\" are also considered significant factors. \n\nThe active convective activity near the Philippines continued into September, sustaining the strength of the Pacific High. Combined with the northward meandering of the subtropical jet stream, the straightening of the polar jet stream (which rarely descended southward near Japan), and the northward shift of the Tibetan High, the intense heat in Japan persisted into September. \n\nRegarding the relationship between this heatwave and global warming, changes in atmospheric circulation (airflow) and ocean circulation influenced by global warming, as well as the baseline increase in average temperatures, have been pointed out."

It was the second longest heat wave experienced in Argentina since records began in 1906, affecting at least 52 cities across the country. For the first time since the creation of the heat alarm system, a red-level alert was in effect for several consecutive days both in the city of Buenos Aires and in the city of Rosario in Santa Fe. The cause of this heat wave was the Madden-Julian oscillation, which caused the South Atlantic anticyclone to settle over the continent, creating an atmospheric blockage that led to high temperatures and scarce precipitation in the central and northern parts of the country, while halting subpolar and subtropical frontal systems, resulting in unusual summer snowfalls in Tierra del Fuego and torrential rains in Brazil."

From the 19th, this anomalous situation began to expand towards northern Argentina and intensified again over the central part, affecting 18 provinces, subsiding around December 30 in the central part and between January 1 and 2 in the extreme north of the country with the passage of a cold front that caused a change in the air mass. As a result, most localities located between 30°S and 40°S recorded 1 or 2 heatwaves during the period, with durations ranging from 5 to 18 consecutive days, and average minimum temperatures exceeding 4°C and average maximum temperatures exceeding 6°C compared to the normal for the season. The long persistence of this heatwave (22 days) made the event exceptional, breaking several records regarding the highest number of consecutive days with minimum and maximum temperatures above the average in several meteorological stations in the affected area. The National Meteorological Service reported, through its daily updates, information on the development of the heatwave. Meteorological agencies in Uruguay and Paraguay also declared a state of alert due to the heatwave."

This occurs in exceptional cases of heat waves, which can affect all healthy people, not just at-risk groups. Up to that point, several deaths had been recorded with heat stroke episodes as direct causes of death. In Santiago del Estero, eleven deaths associated with heat stroke occurred. In Entre Ríos, seven more cases were reported, largely due to cardiorespiratory arrests and decompensations caused by the intense heat, as well as one fatality from heat stroke in the district of Avellaneda, and in the province of Salta, one fatality was reported due to sunstroke. In various locations, several drownings were also recorded (largely due to thermal shock) as several people attempted to cool off in some rivers in the provinces of Córdoba (9 cases), Santa Fe (4 cases), Buenos Aires (5 cases), Entre Ríos (4 cases), Mendoza (3 cases), Corrientes (4 cases), San Luis (1 case), Salta (1 case), Santiago del Estero (1 case), and Jujuy (1 case). In the city of Buenos Aires, two people died from carbon monoxide poisoning after turning on a generator to alleviate the intense nighttime heat. The following day, a similar case occurred, where a 50-year-old man lost his life for the same reason, and several days later, an elderly person was found dead in their apartment in the Villa del Parque neighborhood due to power outages and the intense heat. In the district of Avellaneda, three people died in a fire while trying to light the place with candles since they had no electricity due to power outages. Meanwhile, for the same reason, four people died in a house fire in Quilmes, and one more person in the city of Buenos Aires. In the city of Pergamino, an elderly person also fell victim to a fire caused by an electrical failure in a ventilation device. Also in the city, SAME recorded a peak in emergency calls; most of the emergencies were related to fainting and low blood pressure, typical symptoms of heat stroke, and because pre-existing health conditions worsened, such as the emergence of a dengue outbreak in a region as southern as the province of Entre Ríos, a large province where such disease (dengue in Argentina is almost always a zoonosis carried by people who have previously been in much more northern areas than Argentina). In Rosario, 70 swimmers cooling off in the Paraná River on Christmas Day were attacked by a school of piranhas, carnivorous fish of the genus Serrasalmus —to which piranhas also belong—. These fish were fleeing to cooler areas due to the high water temperatures caused by the heat wave. The following day, another attack by these fish occurred at a beach on the Paraná River in Posadas (Misiones), injuring 15 people."

                "content": "On December 23, Buenos Aires legislator Marcelo Ramal presented a bill for an electricity emergency in the City of Buenos Aires. This initial project proposed the creation of a crisis committee composed of: one representative from each legislative bloc, representatives from the consultative councils of the Communes and affected neighborhoods, elected representatives of workers and technicians from energy distributors, and academics from the Faculty of Engineering at UBA. The committee would have authority over the distribution companies and would organize an energy restoration operation. The project included the formation of 60 emergency crews (4 per commune) to repair damaged lines and substations, as well as the provision of 1,500 generators (100 per commune). The costs related to these operations would be financed through a tax on gambling establishments in the City, which are currently exempt. However, only five legislators (in addition to Ramal, Gustavo Vera, Virginia González Gass, Pablo Bergel, and Alejandro Bodart, the latter two with their own projects) signed the request for the Legislature to hold a special session to address this issue. The project was ignored by the remaining legislators, prompting the five signatories to hold a press conference. Chief of Staff Jorge Capitanich pointed to the electricity providers, Edenor and Edesur, as responsible for the outages and urged users to direct their complaints to the companies. He announced an administrative holiday for December 30 starting at 12 p.m. Working groups were created within the framework of the climate emergency, unifying the tasks of security forces (police, army, civil defense, and firefighters) with the availability of 500 patrol cars, 17,000 agents, and 3,200 cameras. Days later, the head of government of the City of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, declared an energy emergency due to the energy collapse affecting his city. Similarly, Capitanich announced the executive branch's intention to nationalize the management of the electricity service if Edenor and Edesur did not resolve the supply issues. When asked about Nicolás Caputo, a shareholder in Edesur and the main beneficiary of public works in Buenos Aires, responsible for the power outages, he avoided responding or referencing the responsibility of energy distribution companies like Edesur, owned by his close friend with whom he shares business interests. As a result of the prolonged power outages, numerous protests occurred due to public discontent in most neighborhoods of the City of Buenos Aires, disrupting traffic on streets, highways, and bridges. One of the most affected roadways by the protests was the Buenos Aires-La Plata Highway, where a total vehicle collapse was recorded. In the city, there were various demonstrations by residents, including street and avenue blockades. By the first days of January 2014, some neighborhoods in the City of Buenos Aires had been without electricity for more than two weeks, leading residents to block the Sarmiento railway line as a form of protest, as well as in the Province of Buenos Aires. Ramal, the author of the law proposing the energy emergency, criticized Macri's measure, considering that \"what Macri did is a caricature of an energy emergency, not a real emergency,\" as \"no extraordinary measures were taken to restore the service nor resources allocated to address an emergency.\" The national and city governments agreed to coordinate assistance tasks for residents who remained without power. Mauricio Macri himself requested a change in the time zone for the City of Buenos Aires, the Argentine coast, and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Córdoba. The National Minister of Planning, Julio De Vido, strongly rejected the proposal, explaining that \"having two time zones would cause disruptions and costs greater than the benefits, as it would not be logical, for example, to have one time in Córdoba and another in Santiago del Estero.\" The planning minister then asked \"Argentine companies\" with shares in Edesur to \"take responsibility as Argentines\" for the power outages. \"I am referring to the Caputo Group, Escasany Group, Miguens Bemberg Group, Guillermo Reca, and Guillermo Vázquez.\""

Edesur was required to compensate users with a total of 221 million pesos, while Edenor had to compensate them with 77 million. After the outages caused by the heatwave, starting in 2014, Edenor initiated an investment plan that allowed a 32% reduction in outages."

The mercury still reached 48°C in Phoenix and 47°C in Las Vegas. During the night, the mercury fluctuated between 20 and 35°C, posing a real danger to the human body, which cannot cool down at any time. However, the relative humidity was exceptionally low, often below 10%, making the extreme heat more \"bearable.\" During this heatwave, forecasters recorded 46°C in Phoenix, 42°C in Tucson, and 43°C in Las Vegas by midday on a Saturday, but it was expected that the mercury would rise further in the afternoon. At noon, the thermometer read 45°C in Death Valley, at Furnace Creek. Death Valley is one of the hottest places on the globe."

Thus, there were two depressions located on either side of an anticyclone. On their western equatorial periphery, the high pressures carried very hot and very humid air from Mexico in a south to southwest flow, which dried out and warmed further due to the foehn effect as it passed over the Rocky Mountains. As a result, in the plains, there was a completely clear sky, sunny weather, and extremely high temperatures, most exceeding 40°C and approaching 50°C."

The extreme heat made roads and sidewalks extremely hot. Authorities feared that migrants attempting to cross the border clandestinely between Mexico and the United States might die in the desert; consequently, reinforcements were deployed to monitor the border on the American side. Seven people were found dead in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona. An elderly person was discovered dead in their home in Las Vegas, as they did not have air conditioning. In Oregon, about forty sheep succumbed to the heat, while more than 200 other animals had to be rescued. The paws of dogs and cats had to be protected against burns caused by the scorching asphalt. Additionally, and particularly in California, the extreme heat hindered airplane takeoffs, leaving them grounded. Numerous fires were reported, including a massive one in California that caused the death of 19 firefighters who were trying to combat the blaze. This extreme heatwave was one of the most intense ever observed in the world: temperatures close to some of the world's heat records were recorded in certain states."

In Western and Central Europe, the summer of 2003 was considered the hottest since the year 1500. The major heatwaves of the summer of 2003 reached their peak during the first half of August and were caused by the persistence of synoptic situations with advection of hot Saharan air from North Africa (see the 850 hPa reanalyses below). Additionally, these situations were exacerbated by prior conditions of extreme soil and vegetation dryness due to a prolonged drought in the spring and early summer. As a result of this dryness, almost all of the Sun's radiation was converted into heat, as it could not be absorbed by the soil and vegetation. The predominant zonal (west-east) climatic circulation pattern over Europe shifted slightly, generating a more meridional (south-north) circulation with a higher geopotential height, leading to elevated temperatures and atmospheric stability conditions during the summer of 2003 across Western and Central Europe. The temperatures at 850 hPa that summer were 3°C higher than the 1948-2012 climatic average."

As a result of the heatwaves, more than 30,000 people died across Europe, most of them vulnerable elderly individuals, and nearly 650,000 hectares burned in over 25,000 fires that occurred across the continent. The heat also led to a loss of glacier volume in the Alps on the order of 5-10% (European Climate Assessment and Dataset, ECA&D). The heat affected Western and Central Europe (especially France), with temperatures exceeding 40°C in much of the Iberian Peninsula and France. In the Portuguese region of Alentejo, temperatures reached 47.3°C, while in numerous cities in southern Spain, temperatures exceeded 45°C, with a maximum of 46.2°C in Córdoba. In Catalonia, in Vinebre, in the Ribera d'Ebre, the country's maximum value of 42.2°C was reached on August 13, 2003.

                "content": "Around June 23–26, a high-pressure bridge formed from the Azores High to the departing Central Europe High Zoe, from which, under the influence of a low-pressure system over the British Isles (Quintus), the High Annelie developed around June 29, later shifting over the Baltic Sea. Spain was particularly affected by the heatwave in its early stages, where heat records were already set at the end of June 2015 with temperatures reaching up to 43°C. Nationwide heat warnings were in effect from June 25, with at least the second warning level in place from June 28. In Algeria and Morocco, temperatures repeatedly exceeded 40°C even along the coast. Portugal, however, was comparatively affected only briefly. Other parts of Western Europe also recorded unusually high maximum air temperatures. In France, numerous local record temperatures of just under 40°C were recorded, with temperatures along the Channel coast being up to 20°C above the long-term average for this time. At London Heathrow Airport, a temperature of 36.7°C was measured on July 1, 2015, surpassing the previous July record for the United Kingdom. In the Netherlands, July 2 saw the hottest July day ever recorded, with 38.2°C in Maastricht, marking the third-highest temperature ever measured in the country. The heat quickly spread to western Central Europe. In Germany, all-time record temperatures were measured at many stations, surpassing the values from the summer of 2003. In Karlsruhe, 40.8°C was recorded on July 5, 2015, by the Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research. However, as the German Weather Service (DWD) had ceased measurements at this location on November 1, 2008, these values are not considered official. The DWD measured 40.3°C in Kitzingen, which at the time was the highest temperature ever recorded in Germany since the start of comprehensive weather records in 1881, narrowly surpassing the previous record of 40.2°C. Switzerland experienced one of the most extreme heatwaves from July 1–7 in 150 years, alongside 2003 and 1947. Unusually high temperatures were also recorded in northern Sweden due to strong southerly winds, with a new high of 32.8°C in Forse, Ångermanland (southern Norrland), on July 2. Elsewhere, temperatures exceeded 30°C in both northern and southern Sweden until July 5. In early July, the center of Annelie shifted over Poland, and the heatwave also reached eastern Central Europe, with peak temperatures around 35°C in Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. However, the all-time record temperatures of the 2013 heatwave were not reached here. Severe thunderstorms developed from the west along the incoming cold front of the next low-pressure system, Siegfried, over the British Isles. In the South Westphalia region, hailstones the size of tennis balls were reported. However, the thunderstorms did not bring significant cooling. Following the front, the European sub-core of the high-pressure complex was named Bigi. From July 7, the heat intensified over eastern Central Europe, Italy, and the Balkans, as a strong cold front from the following North Sea low, Thompson, which ended the heatwave, pushed the hot air masses of Western Central Europe ahead of it. Record values were now measured from the Swiss Plateau to the Pannonian Plain. Geneva recorded 39.7°C, the highest value ever measured for the northern side of the Alps. Innsbruck registered a new high of 38.2°C on July 7, while Lugano (25.4°C on July 7) and Vienna (26.9°C on July 8) recorded their warmest nights since measurements began. Seibersdorf recorded the highest early morning temperature ever measured in Austria (30.4°C at 8 a.m.). In Hungary, values exceeding 39°C surpassed local 60-year-old records from the summer of 1957 (39.3°C in Budakalász, Pest). Towards the Black Sea and the Aegean, the heatwave lasted only one to two days with temperatures up to nearly 40°C (Bucharest, July 9), but severe weather warnings were also issued here. The cold front moving across the Alps caused severe storms in central and southern Germany, western and southern Austria, northern Italy, and the Hungarian Plain. In Tyrol (Innsbruck 141 km/h), Carinthia, and also central Hungary, where the greatest heat had recently prevailed (Aszód, PE, 131 km/h), wind gusts reached hurricane strength, leading to windthrow, traffic disruptions, and power outages. Hailstones up to the size of golf balls were reported from Saxony-Anhalt and the Villach–Gailtal area, causing extensive roof damage in some regions. Styria recorded downpours of up to 65 liters in a few minutes. Between Dolo and Mira near Venice, a level 3/EF4 tornado caused devastation. A reported tornado in Framersheim (Rhineland-Palatinate) might also have been a downburst."

                "content": "After this front, the heat retreated to the Mediterranean region, with the heatwave in Spain entering its third week. On July 6, temperatures exceeded 45 degrees Celsius in the lower Guadalquivir region up to the interior of the Valencia province (Córdoba Observatory, Andalusia, 45.2°C), and on July 7 (Zaragoza Airport, Aragon, 44.5°C; Murcia, Murcia, 43°C), the highest values since the beginning of weather records in the 1920s were recorded in numerous locations. In terms of temperature, duration, and extent, it had already surpassed the heatwaves of 2012 and 1991 by early July and became the second most severe heatwave since 1975, after 2003. With high-pressure system Clara and the low-pressure systems Thompson and Ulrich, normal summer weather returned to Central Europe, which brought a brief slight relief to Spain with cold fronts. Along the Alpine edge, these led to severe thunderstorms in the Salzburg region. From July 11, temperatures in central and southern Spain again widely approached the 40-degree mark. Subsequently, the high-pressure system—named Dietlinde—expanded again towards Central and then Eastern Europe. Temperatures there also quickly rose above 35 degrees. On July 16, the heatwave in Spain eased with the arrival of a cold front (temperatures now up to slightly above 35 degrees), while the Scirocco began in the Maghreb (Tunisia up to 41°C). France recorded a new national peak value for this heatwave with over 41 degrees (41.4°C in Brive-la-Gaillarde, Corrèze). In the high mountain regions of the Alps, a record value was also measured (+6.7°C at Capanna Margherita, Piedmont, at 4560 m). This time, Italy was more extensively affected, with temperatures repeatedly exceeding 40°C in Emilia, Apulia, Calabria, and record nighttime temperatures (Turin 27.1°C on July 16/17). Slovenia recorded up to 38 degrees during these days. In Hungary, temperatures reached up to 37°C, and the highest heat warning level was in effect in parts of the Balkans, such as Croatia, where 40.0°C was measured in Split-Kaštela, Dalmatia, on July 18, as well as in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro (38.2°C in Podgorica on July 17), Serbia (up to 38°C), and parts of Romania (up to 39°C). During this time, powerful low-pressure troughs dominated the weather in northern Europe, developing into a series of lows named Waldemar–Xaver–Yakari, with slow-moving paths from the British Isles to the Baltic region, steering disturbance fronts over Central Europe. Severe heat thunderstorms occurred from Spain to the Baltic region, more extensively in Germany, Austria, and Poland. A local gust storm near Strasbourg required the evacuation of a scout meeting with 15,000 attendees. A downpour in the Neuchâtel Jura (La Frétaz, 31 mm/10 min) reached intensities rarely measured in Switzerland. On July 17, Innsbruck Airport recorded storm gusts of 115 km/h, Altenrhein Airport 109 km/h, Poznań in Poland 101 km/h on July 19, and Prievidza in Slovakia 112 km/h on July 20. Four hail fronts devastated the Styrian municipalities of Pusterwald and Pölstal within just five hours on July 19. A new front from July 21 to 23 settled over the Alps and Carpathians, followed by two unusual Atlantic storm lows for this time of year on July 24/25 and July 26/27, named Zeljko and Andreas. These ended the heat with temperature drops of up to 15 degrees within a few hours in northwestern Europe. They again pushed warm air ahead of them. In the Czech Republic, July 22 was the hottest day of the year, with 39.2°C measured in Husinec u Řeže near Prague. In Slovakia, 38.2°C was recorded in Dudince in central Slovakia, just 0.1°C below the highest temperature ever measured (Vysoká nad Uhom, 2007). Austria recorded values of 37.9°C in Langenlebarn and Bad Deutsch-Altenburg, similar to early July. Under the influence of high pressure south and east of the Pyrenees and Alps, temperatures remained extreme, especially in Andalusia (up to over 38 degrees) and the Hungarian-Serbian-Romanian lowlands (repeatedly 39.0°C in southern Hungary). The southern side of the Swiss Alps remained under the highest heat warning level until July 24. In southeastern Central Europe, cloud cover during this time made the nights particularly warm, with Tata (Komárom-Esztergom) recording a new all-time record for a tropical night on July 25, with a minimum of 25.2°C at dawn (previously 24.0°C in 1988), while daytime temperatures were widely around 35°C. These cold fronts brought severe storms again from southern France to northern Russia and the Carpathian region. In the Blenio Valley in Ticino, a downpour on July 21 with 70 mm within an hour again reached an intensity rarely recorded in Switzerland. After thunderstorms, there was a severe mudslide in the Rauris Valley in Salzburg on July 23, followed by flash floods in the Lavant Valley, Carinthia, on July 24. Storm Zeljko was the most intense summer storm ever recorded in the Netherlands on July 25. On July 26 and 27, severe storms occurred in Russia, with up to 50 mm of rain falling northwest of Moscow during the night, and in the city itself, a 130-year record for this day was surpassed with 39.9 mm (previously 39.1 mm in 1883). Golf ball-sized hailstones were reported this time from places such as Horb am Neckar (July 22) and the Bryansk Oblast (July 27). A small tornado was sighted near Püspökladány in Hungary on July 26."

                "content": "On July 26, the heat largely retreated to the Mediterranean,[128][129] but at the same time merged with the Central Asian heat, which caused high-pressure system Eva, among others, over Russia.[108][9] Now, in addition to southern Spain[12] and the entire Mediterranean coast from Morocco to Syria, Ukraine[130] also reported temperatures well above 35 degrees, while in Greece (41°C in Larisa, July 29),[131] western Turkey, Serbia, Romania[132], and Bulgaria[133], measurements again exceeded the 40-degree mark, as the heat in Eastern Europe retreated to southern Russia.[125]  \nAt that time, temperatures ranged from a good 38 degrees in the eastern Mediterranean region to nearly 50 degrees in Mesopotamia and the Arabian Peninsula, e.g., Baghdad recorded up to 49°C for several days.[134] In the Maghreb, intense Scirocco winds resumed with 41°C on July 28 in southern Spain and Algiers, and then 42°C on July 30 in Tunis.[135] Around July 31, Central Europe was under the high-pressure influence of high-pressure system Finchen,[136] while a small Mediterranean-Alpine low-pressure system brought some cooling to Spain[12] and severe storms in Tuscany, particularly in Florence.[137] Subsequently, normal summer weather with temperatures around 35°C returned to the Mediterranean region. The high-pressure system stabilized over Eastern Europe. A new, strong, and stationary low-pressure complex over the British Isles to northern Scandinavia, named Bonimir[138][139]-Christian,[140], brought subtropical warm air back to Central Europe with its fronts, this time as a high-pressure ridge primarily eastward around the Alpine region. By August 3, temperatures in the Pannonian Basin, as well as in Poland, eastern Germany, and the Baltic region, rose above 35°C. After a disturbance passed, tropical air flowed west of the Alps from August 6 onward.[141][142] In Vallon-Pont-d’Arc in Ardèche, 40.6°C was recorded on August 6 and 40.9°C the following day.[143]  \nOn August 7, Kitzingen in Franconia recorded Germany's record temperature of 40.3°C from early July again.[15][16] On the same day, the Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research in Karlsruhe measured a new high of 41.2°C.[39] In Hungary, Poland, and eastern Austria,[144][145], as well as parts of eastern Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and northern Serbia, the highest heat warning level persisted for up to 10 consecutive days, with Hungary experiencing it nationwide throughout.  \nIn the Czech Republic, the Czech Meteorological Institute ČHMÚ recorded 39.3°C in Řež near Prague on August 7[146] and then 39.8°C in Řež and Dobřichovice on August 8,[147] marking the hottest days of the year so far.  \nBerlin-Kaniswall on August 7 and Wrocław in Poland[148] on August 8 each recorded a new station record of 38.9°C,[149] as did Minsk in Belarus with 35.8°C (124 years of measurements).[150][149] The smaller upper-level low-pressure core Detlef of the departing low-pressure system Christian, which moved southeastward from the Alps over Italy, ended the heat in southwestern Europe but intensified the warm air inflow over the eastern Alpine region. A new Eastern European high-pressure system, Gwendolin, stabilized.[151][152] Tarifa in Cádiz, Spain, recorded a new record temperature of 35.4°C[153], and Morón de la Frontera (Seville) experienced a nighttime minimum temperature of 26.6°C on the night of August 9,[153] while Vienna's city center recorded 26.9°C on the night of August 10,[154] both setting new tropical night records. Topoľčany in Slovakia measured 38.2°C on August 10.[155] The low-pressure system Detlef became a Mediterranean low with an unusually southern trajectory of the Va–Vd characteristic[156] and dissipated over Malta. Severe thunderstorms developed locally ahead of the fronts.  \nMajor landslides occurred on August 5 in San Vito di Cadore near Cortina d’Ampezzo,[157] and in the Gail and Drau valleys in Carinthia.[158]  \nIn Jósvafő in northeastern Hungary, 50 mm of rain fell in 20 minutes, and hail up to 2.5 cm in diameter was reported in Budapest.[159]  \nSevere storms with flooding and mudslides[160] occurred on August 8 in Sarganserland (Weisstannental),[161] Tyrol (Stubaital, Sellraintal),[162] and Salzburg (Mittersill, Kleinarltal, Riedingtal),[163] and on August 10 in Vorarlberg (Gamperdonatal).[164] Severe thunderstorms also occurred on this day in the Stuttgart area, as well as in Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, and North Rhine-Westphalia.[165]  \nThe upper-level trough over Italy caused severe storms with wind and flooding on August 10 and 11 in Italy,[156][166][167] particularly in Campania, as well as Umbria and Tuscany. A tornado occurred again in Marina di Carrara,[166] a severe hailstorm in Andria,[166] and an enormous 230 mm of rainfall in Rossano Calabro in 5 hours, with 350 mm over the course of the day.[168] Subsequently, the weather pattern shifted: the Azores high extended to Newfoundland, the advancing Atlantic low-pressure system moved northward and did not progress beyond Iceland, while unstable low-pressure systems formed over Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region as the high-pressure system retreated, and a high-pressure bridge developed over Scandinavia (Hildegard–Isabell) into the polar region. A new low-pressure system (Eberhard) formed over the Bay of Biscay and merged with the Icelandic low.[152] These fronts, extending into the Mediterranean region (local low Florian from the Bay of Biscay over the Alps), initially directed warm air with unusual southeastern upper-level flows as far as northern France but then – very slowly progressing – brought successive significant cooling to Central Europe. Simultaneously, a northeastern cold air intrusion over northern Russia into Poland brought cooling to Eastern Europe.[169][170] Warm air masses were again compressed in the Pannonian-Carpathian region, with 37.8°C in Budapest-Újpest on August 13 and 26.1°C in Lágymányos, marking the hottest day and warmest night ever recorded in Budapest (previously 37.4°C in 1946 and 25.0°C in 1952, respectively).[171] Similarly high temperatures were recorded in adjacent areas of Slovakia[172] and Serbia, while in Moravia, 35 stations (out of a total of 161 nationwide) recorded a day as hot as not seen in 20 to 50 years, including 36.9°C in Lučina on August 14.[173] Temperatures across Central Europe dropped by up to 20°C within a few days, such as in Montélimar, France, with thunderstorms from 37°C on August 13 to 20°C on August 14,[174] or in Prague from 35.2°C on August 14 to 14.6°C on August 18.[175]  \nIn Germany, the front caused severe, sometimes stationary storms with wind, hail, and flooding, including a 5–10-year rainfall event in the Stuttgart metropolitan area.[176]  \nIn the western Alps, a Föhn storm with speeds up to 100 km/h began on August 13, and on August 14, the pressure difference between the western and eastern halves of Switzerland was 8 hPa.[177]  \nThe fronts also extended to the Adriatic region, causing storms in Italy, particularly in Bologna and Rome,[178][179] and in Croatia in Istria and the Kvarner region on August 15.[180]  \nIn the Greater Poland and Lower Silesia regions, intense thunderstorm storms occurred on August 15.[178]  \nThen, in a relatively narrow band from the northern Balkans to the German North Sea coast, intense rainfall began,[169][181][171] with Budapest receiving 80 mm in just one hour and 139 mm in 51 hours on August 17, which is double the average August amount,[170] or 90.2 mm on the same day in Hurbanovo, the highest daily amount recorded there since measurements began in 1876 and also nearly double the monthly average.[181]  \nIn Germany, up to 150 mm of rain fell in a strip from Saxony to North Rhine-Westphalia between August 16 and 19, leading to flooding during heavier thunderstorms due to the parched soils.[176] A small upper-level low over the upper Adriatic[182] continued to cause intense rain in northern Italy and the western Balkans."

                "content": "Over Scandinavia, the stable high-pressure system (Isabell) persisted, with midsummer temperatures reaching Norway, where the summer had previously been largely rainy. Frosta in Nord-Trøndelag (Central Norway) recorded 28.8°C on August 19, temperatures comparable to Rome at that time. Areas such as Pomerania and Western Pomerania were not affected by the cold snap. Then, a southerly flow reestablished itself ahead of the fronts of the powerful Icelandic low-pressure system from previous days, with temperatures exceeding 35°C in Portugal and Spain from August 17, up to 33°C in the Foehn regions of southwestern France, and up to 30°C in southeastern England on August 22. A new Bay of Biscay–North Sea–Scandinavia low-pressure complex (Gerald–Hans–Immanuel) with an associated Mediterranean low brought heavy rainfall to the western and southern Alpine edges, causing floods and landslides in Hérault (Soumont 210 mm/24 h) and on the Côte d’Azur. The situation escalated particularly in Montpellier in southeastern France. In the Alps, Foehn storm fields reached speeds of about 120 km/h at locations such as Gütsch or Patscherkofel. Behind these low-pressure systems, a stable bridge developed again from the Azores high to the high-pressure system Isabell, which had since moved to Eastern Europe, and this was named Jessica. This brought another heatwave to Central Europe with southwesterly upper-level flow and subtropical air, while a low-pressure trough formed as an air mass boundary stretching from the central North Atlantic over northern Germany to the Black Sea. In southern Italy, temperatures reached up to 35°C from August 24, and in Spain's interior, up to 38°C from August 25. The heat then extended again to the Baltic region and the Black Sea (High Karma, later Jessica there) and merged once more with the Middle Eastern heat. Temperatures over 30°C were recorded as far as Latvia, and over 35°C in several areas of the Balkans, Romania, southern Ukraine, and the Krasnodar–Caucasus region of southern Russia. Only from August 30 did a cooling begin, starting from the Iberian Peninsula, as the disturbance zone controlled by the Scandinavian lows Hans/Immanuel, which had previously been situated in a west-east direction over Central Europe, slowly ended this last heatwave of the meteorological summer. The persistent southwesterly flow shifted the warm air to Eastern Europe. Ahead of the cold front, the hottest September day ever recorded was noted in many places from the Baltic Sea to the Pannonian Plain on September 1, with some locations even setting new all-time highs, such as Görlitz in Saxony with 33.3°C (one degree above the previous record from 1947). With Foehn winds, temperatures in the Austrian Alpine foothills and the Weinviertel exceeded 35°C, with the highest value recorded in Pottschach at the Alpine edge at 36.0°C. In the Czech Republic, Vráž in South Bohemia reported 36.5°C on August 31, and Javorník in Silesia recorded 37.4°C the next day (far exceeding the previous highest September value of 32.2°C on September 6, 2008). Michalovce in the Eastern Slovak Lowlands recorded 36.4°C. Dombegyház on the Hungarian-Serbian border also set a national September record with 36.9°C. Temperatures above 35°C and higher warning levels persisted in southeastern Serbia and Macedonia until September 5. The following day, the heatwave reached around Athens for several more days, with temperatures nearing 40°C, ahead of the southward-advancing low-pressure trough over the Balkans. A smaller low-pressure complex Jonas/Kalle over the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and then the Baltic region, which had formed from the previous disturbance zone, brought heavy thunderstorms with widespread severe weather, storms, hail, and flooding, particularly along the air mass boundary in the Mediterranean region, for over a week. Temperatures dropped widely by 15°C to 20°C in a short time. On the night of August 31 to September 1, a large storm cell formed over southwestern France, with hurricane-force gusts (152.6 km/h, Le Montat in Lot, the highest wind peak ever recorded there). From northern Europe, only isolated reports of severe local storms were received, such as in the Aurich district in East Frisia and Saxony. In Emmerich am Rhein, crows were killed by very sudden hail, a rare phenomenon. Severe hailstorms occurred in the Tyrolean Inn Valley on September 3. From September 3 to 4, more than a month's average rainfall fell from a storm cell in southern Spain and the Balearic Islands. These then moved with heavy rain over Provence and northern Italy, with hailstones up to the size of hen's eggs reported in Naples on September 5. Another larger-scale thunderstorm area (mesoscale convective system) brought torrential rain of up to 100 mm/3 h on September 8 in Calatabiano (Sicily), 90 mm/24 h on Kerkyra (Corfu, Ionian Islands), and then heavier rainfall in Serbia."

From there, a high-pressure bridge formed between the Mediterranean lows into the North African region, which, starting September 9, again led to temporarily summer-like temperatures from Switzerland to Eastern Europe with strong föhn-like southwesterly flows. From September 14, temperatures gradually rose above 30 degrees in the Alpine foothills, eastern Austria, the Carpathian Basin, and then the Eastern European Plain. The Alpine föhn reached hurricane strength on September 16, with 172 km/h at Gütsch (September 17), 135 km/h at Weissbad AI (Ebenalp) (September 16), 156 km/h at Patscherkofel (Tir.) (September 16), 119 km/h in the valleys at Brülisau AI (September 16), 136 km/h in Innsbruck-Olympic Village (September 16), and still up to 100 km/h in Vienna (September 18), causing widespread storm damage. In Austria, Gumpoldskirchen recorded a new record of 35.5°C on September 17 for the second half of September, with temperatures above 30 degrees this late in the year only recorded a few times in the entire measurement history (in Vienna in 1947, 2003, 1961, and 1867). In the central Balkans and later along the lower Danube, the heat reached well over 35 degrees. Szeged measured 36.4°C on September 17 and Körösszakálon 37.2°C on September 18, each setting new national September records. In the southern and eastern Carpathians, temperatures were up to 10°C above the normal weekly average for these days, with some locations recording the highest values of the year. Along the Italian lower Adriatic (Abruzzo, Molise, and Puglia) on September 17, temperatures even exceeded 40 degrees, also marking the highest September temperatures ever recorded there. The warmth also reached the Baltic region and Scandinavia again. The heat persisted in the Carpathian Basin until September 19 and then retreated with High Lajana into the Aegean–Black Sea region. Around September 25, it reached the Moscow area and the White Sea region with High Maybrit and large-scale southern flows, persisting until early October in the Russian Black Sea region and Volga area. Ahead of the advancing fronts of an Atlantic low-pressure complex – Leo, Michael, and ex-Henri, a tropical storm from the mid-Atlantic – there were massive rains in the southern slopes of southern France (Épisode méditerranéen) from September 11–13, with 256 mm/24 h in Valleraugue (Gard), 242 mm/6 h in Grospierres (Ardèche), and over 110 km/h winds in Nice. The following front, which pushed the heat out of Southeast Europe, brought storms on September 16 from Portugal across northern Spain, central France (135 km/h in Saint-Dizier, Champagne-Ardenne, and Clamecy, Burgundy), southeastern England, western Germany, to southern Sweden. Another Adriatic low (Patrik) led to heavy rains and tornadoes in the Aegean region on September 21/22. This was followed by another stable European high, Netti, associated with autumnal temperatures in Central Europe but again exceeding 30 degrees in Portugal and southern Spain."

                "content": "A particular feature of this heatwave is the preceding series of large and poorly predictable temperature fluctuations in Europe during the spring.  \nAs early as the beginning of May, a heatwave in Spain reached temperatures of nearly 45 degrees (44.4°C in Carcaixent, southern Valencia) and claimed lives, while temperatures in Central Europe reached 30 degrees. This heatwave ended with severe storms.  \nAfterward, the Alpine region experienced persistent rain, subzero temperatures, and snowfall down to low altitudes due to a strong cold spell. In some areas, this month was the cloudiest May in the last 25 years.  \nJune initially brought another heat period with up to 35 degrees in Central Europe and again severe thunderstorms. The subsequent \"sheep cold\" in the second half of June – surprisingly, according to medium-term forecasts – led to a polar cold air intrusion, with temperatures dropping significantly below 10 degrees (e.g., 0.3°C in Obertauern, 1772 m, on June 24).  \nIt was the globally warmest May and June recorded since the beginning of consistent worldwide weather records in the 1880s. At the same time, the eastern edge of the European heatwave, in the region from Central Siberia to the Caspian Sea (47.2°C in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, June 30), to Pakistan (49°C in June), and then in Siberia and northern China (up to 40°C in mid-July), as well as in the Middle East (52.5°C in Mitribah, Kuwait, July 17; Mahshahr, Iran, 46°C, August 1) and northeastern Africa (46°C in southern Egypt in mid-August), experienced abnormal heat, with severe wildfires in Siberia around Lake Baikal.  \nSimultaneously, North America (northwest; repeatedly 45°C, June 28), where one of the most intense wildfire years in recent history occurred after years of drought, Mexico (up to 40 degrees at the end of August), and Japan (38.5°C in Jōetsu Takada, July 13) also experienced heatwaves.  \nColombia (42.2°C, Urumitia, July 1) and Thailand (41.1°C, Kamalasai, July 1) reported their hottest July days since records began. In Africa, July was the second hottest (after 2002), and in South America, the fifth hottest in recorded history.  \nIn contrast, unusual cold was recorded in New Zealand and Australia during their southern winter in mid-July (snowfall in the Blue Mountains not seen in 20 years).  \nOverall, both July and August – like the two preceding months – were the hottest ever recorded globally, with August particularly in Europe, Africa, and South America.  \nFrom May onward, an extensive blocking situation persisted across the Northern Hemisphere, particularly pronounced over the Pacific, leading to an abnormal jet stream pattern, disrupted westerly drift, and stationary high-pressure systems, causing heatwaves on four continents.  \nThe North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillation indices fell sharply, contrary to forecasts, indicating polar cold air flowing toward Europe due to a weak Azores High; however, this air did not reach the continent due to the blocking but remained over the mid-Atlantic.  \nThe last such regularly occurring hemispheric blocking situation had led to a major cold wave in North America, winter heat in Siberia, and storm surges and floods in Europe during the winter of 2014.  \nFrom the second decade of July, a powerful polar high dominated Europe's weather. This caused the tropical Hadley cell to expand into mid-latitudes. Simultaneously, the West African monsoon system (Guinea monsoon) intensified, steering tropical air masses over the Sahara into the Mediterranean region.  \nAs a result, the heat center shifted from the western to the central and then eastern Mediterranean.  \nAt the beginning of August, a strongly blocked omega pattern developed between Atlantic lows and a cold-air-drop-like low over Siberia, with warm air advancing over the White Sea to the North Pole; for example, 850-hPa temperatures there on August 7 exceeded 0°C, comparable to Ireland or the West Siberian Plain east of the Urals.  \nThe Azores High, meanwhile, shifted to the western Atlantic at about 35° north latitude, corresponding to the latitude of North Carolina–Gibraltar. The jet stream was consequently displaced to higher latitudes of 40–60°, reaching Newfoundland–Biscay–northern Scandinavia.  \nOn August 6, an abnormally strong Sahara dust outburst toward South America was observed.  \nThe final phase was characterized by blocked North Atlantic highs, with the jet stream remaining extremely far north.  \nThe overall weather pattern is seen as a symptom of the ongoing El Niño event, active since April, which intensified into the fall and only transitioned into a La Niña event in May 2015.  \nThe intensity of the heat event is considered linked to global warming, according to current research.  \nDue to the El Niño influence and the Azores High characteristics, the Atlantic hurricane season was largely absent, one of the weakest in many years. In contrast, Pacific typhoons were above average in frequency.  \nThe course of the heatwave could be well predicted in July with the European IFS model of ECMWF (10–14 days), while the American NOAA-NCEP CFS/GFS model showed poor results.  \nThe medium-term climatology lies outside expectations, even in the ensemble, and long-term forecasts from the spring – for example, regarding hurricanes – were repeatedly revised.  \nIn addition to numerous local daily values across Europe, which were the highest since the beginning of respective records, it was already foreseeable by mid-July that July 2015 would be the hottest July ever recorded in Spain, Austria, Switzerland, and northern Italy, and one of the hottest months overall, including August months.  \nAugust 2015 was the hottest August in eastern Germany, such as in Berlin and Dresden, in 208 years, with 13 to 14 (locally up to 17 in southeastern Brandenburg) hot days, surpassing the old hot day records of August 1944.  \nAugust 2015 strongly resembled July 2006, which brought up to 21 hot days in Lusatia.  \nThe overall high summer (July and August 2015) was the warmest in Berlin – albeit narrowly – since 1834, surpassing the high summer of 1994.  \nHowever, the three-month interval June–August (meteorological summer) was only the third highest measured in Europe since 2012, after 2003 and 2010.  \nThe low precipitation levels are also abnormal. This can be considered a century-scale event."

                "content": "Heat-related excess mortality was recorded in several countries across Europe. Spain and Switzerland were the most affected, but Italy, France, Belgium, and Greece were also impacted. Direct heat casualties were only sporadically reported, but numerous fatal swimming accidents occurred, particularly in East-Central Europe and the Baltic region. Special emergency plans for health issues caused by prolonged heat were activated in Spain, the Netherlands, and France, among others. The storms and severe weather accompanying the heatwave caused damages amounting to billions of euros (e.g., €150 million on July 8 in Carinthia, one of the region's most severe thunderstorm/hail damage events ever). These events claimed lives in Italy (July 8, August 5, August 10), Hungary (July 8), Austria (July 9, July 21), Poland (July 19), the Netherlands (July 26), the Czech Republic (July 26), and France (August 23, September 16). The heatwave also exacerbated humanitarian issues related to the refugee crisis at the time. It affected North Africa and the crisis region in the Middle East, where droughts and the Syria/ISIS conflict forced millions to flee, with life-threatening conditions due to temperatures exceeding 50°C. Similarly affected were the southern and east-central European countries, which are typical first-asylum states. Their reception centers were completely overcrowded: since spring, over 200,000 refugees arrived in Greece, and around 100,000 in Italy via the Mediterranean. Starting in July, there was uncontrolled migration to Central Europe, particularly along the Balkan route through Greece—worsened by the economic crisis there—which escalated, with daily transit numbers rising from several hundred at the beginning of summer to several thousand by early autumn. Border controls had to be reinstated at numerous borders, even within the EU, sometimes with military support. Hungary erected a border fence with Serbia over the summer. Macedonia declared a state of emergency in late August. Even in Austria and Germany, the main destination for most of these refugees, chaotic conditions prevailed. Across the Mediterranean region and even in temperate Europe, drought became an increasing problem, especially in areas where annual rainfall was already far below average due to spring heatwaves, such as in Portugal, Spain, almost all of France, central Germany, northern Italy, eastern Austria, Ukraine, and Belarus, as well as in Ireland, which was not affected by the heat. Crop failures across Europe also reached billions of euros. For example, the Austrian Hail Insurance estimated the total agricultural damage from heat at €170 million, with an additional €40 million from storms. An exception was viticulture, where the heat led to widespread expectations of a fully ripe harvest and a significant vintage of reserve wines. However, there were also severe hail losses, particularly affecting Chablis in Burgundy shortly before the harvest. The drought also caused river levels to drop, with the Elbe experiencing a 50-year low, and shipping disruptions occurred on the Rhine and Danube, though less severe due to intermittent storms in their catchment areas. The Po River experienced extreme low water levels in July. A unique aspect of the weather event was the overheating of the Mediterranean Sea. By mid-July, surface water temperatures in the Tyrrhenian Sea off southern Italy were already widely at 30°C, and over 28°C in a third of the entire sea area from Gibraltar to the Levant, with peak values in some bays reaching 34°C. (In 2003, temperatures of 32°C were measured off the Balearic Islands in August.) At the end of July, fish die-offs occurred in the Tyrrhenian Sea off Tuscany. Switzerland also experienced dramatic fish die-offs. However, feared severe storms in autumn due to stored energy largely did not materialize. Overheating also became a problem in continental waters, with Lake Constance reaching over 26°C, the highest temperature ever recorded. Widespread forest fires occurred in Europe, including one near the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in early July. Ukrainian and Russian authorities reported no increased radioactivity. In southwestern Germany, there were several forest and grass fires in the first half of July. The situation in the Mediterranean region remained under control by late July, with Greece, which had not been abnormally affected by the heat, experiencing numerous bushfires, including one near Athens, as well as in Italy and the eastern Adriatic region in Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia. More severe fires occurred in Portugal and Spain in mid-August. However, widespread forest damage feared due to the general heat and drought did not materialize. Windthrow from Storm Niklas in late March and others during the summer remained the main cause of localized high forest damage, while bark beetle infestations remained at a low level (e.g., in 2003, severe beetle damage occurred following Winter Storm Uschi and summer heat). In Germany, heat damage to road surfaces in early July caused full closures and speed limits on various highways. In Essen, some urban rail vehicles became stuck in softened bitumen. In the Upper Palatinate, severe track distortions and prolonged closures occurred on the Cham–Waldmünchen and Cham–Bad Kötzting railway lines in mid-July. In Austria, track breaks occurred on the Arlberg and Außerfern railways in Tyrol in early July, which were quickly repaired. According to the French grid operator RTE, numerous power outages occurred at the start of the first heatwave due to network overloads from cooling systems. On June 30, nearly one million French households were without power. Later, there were several extensive power outages across Europe due to storms."

In mid-June, when warm high-pressure systems dominated, extreme heat days were recorded consecutively in western Japan. In early July, when the Pacific high-pressure system intensified, temperatures from northern to western Japan were higher than average. Particularly from August 9 to 12, the country experienced four days of the most intense heat, with over 290 locations recording extreme heat days, an unprecedented event even compared to 2018. Additionally, record-breaking heat was notable in Pacific coastal prefectures such as Miyazaki, Kochi, Wakayama, and Chiba. On the other hand, due to the limited impact of the Foehn phenomenon on the Sea of Japan side, there were many cases where the maximum temperatures were below average, such as in Niigata Prefecture and the two San'in prefectures, where the highest temperatures remained below 37 degrees Celsius."

                "content": "In Katsunuma, Koshu City, Yamanashi Prefecture, the daily maximum temperature exceeded 39°C for four consecutive days, recording 39.1°C on the 9th, 39.2°C on the 10th, 39.3°C on the 11th, and 39.1°C on the 12th. In Tatebayashi City, Gunma Prefecture, a daily maximum temperature of 39.5°C was observed on the 11th. Additionally, from around July 22 to 25 and from July 31 to August 3, high temperatures were recorded in Saga Prefecture, Miyazaki Prefecture, Kochi Prefecture, and other areas. From late August to mid-August, temperatures from northern Japan to western Japan were significantly higher than average, with 39.3°C observed in Ekawasaki, Shimanto City, Kochi Prefecture, on the 9th. Regarding the series of record-breaking high temperatures observed in Ekawasaki, Shimanto City, Kochi Prefecture, and other locations, it has been suggested that the \"two-layer structure\" of high pressure, where the Tibetan high pressure extends over the Pacific high pressure, strengthens the downward airflow within the high-pressure system, compressing and heating the air near the surface, thereby raising temperatures. Additionally, the Foehn phenomenon, where dry, hot winds blow over mountains, has also been cited as a contributing factor. From around the 18th to the 23rd, extreme heat returned to Kyushu. On the 20th, a daily maximum temperature of 39.6°C, tying the all-time record for Kyushu, was observed in Ushibuka, Amakusa City, Kumamoto Prefecture. On the 22nd, extreme heat of 38–39°C was recorded in various parts of the Tokai region. Although the heat gradually subsided thereafter, on October 9, a temperature of 35.1°C, the latest-ever recorded midsummer day in October nationwide, was observed in Itoigawa City, Niigata Prefecture. The monthly temperature deviations from the average were +0.9°C in eastern Japan, +0.7°C in western Japan, and +0.9°C in the Nansei Islands in June; +1.3°C in northern Japan, +1.6°C in western Japan, and +0.3°C in the Nansei Islands in July; and +1.3°C in eastern and western Japan and +0.8°C in the Nansei Islands in August. Notably, the deviations of +2.8°C in western Japan in mid-June, +3.4°C in northern Japan in early July, +1.4°C in the Nansei Islands in early August, and +2.7°C in northern Japan, +2.4°C in eastern Japan, and +2.3°C in western Japan in mid-August were all record highs for those respective periods. Furthermore, in western Japan, the average summer temperature was +1.2°C, the highest since statistics began in 1946. This summer, 125 out of 927 AMeDAS observation points nationwide (143 points including tied records) set new records for daily maximum temperatures."

The Ministry of Education issued a warning to schools to take necessary precautions against heatstroke following the death of a six-year-old child who was exposed to the sun outdoors. It is worth noting that less than half of the schools in the country are equipped with air conditioning, and government officials have previously discussed extending school holidays for the safety of children. Additionally, the government covers the cost of installing air conditioners in schools. Kyushu Electric Power Company had offered a 10% discount on the bills of customers aged 75 and older between August and September in exchange for covering their air conditioning costs."

This was evident, for example, through a persistent drought and heat in Europe, wildfires in California, and other weather events in the Northern Hemisphere. The heatwave in Australia thus continued a series of global heatwaves, following unusual weather events already recorded in Australia in 2016. Since January temperatures in Australia are typically higher than December temperatures, it was feared as early as December 2018 that the heatwave in Australia could persist or even intensify. Many Australians associate the heatwave with global warming. January 2019 was the warmest January in Australia since the beginning of weather records; for the first time, a nationwide average temperature of 30 degrees Celsius was exceeded. The previous January record was surpassed by 2 to 3 degrees in some cases. With 36.6 degrees Celsius on January 26 in Wanaaring (North Western, New South Wales), the nighttime heat record for the Southern Hemisphere was broken."

For the southeast of the country, this was ten to sixteen degrees Celsius above the average values typical for the season. On December 27, a midday temperature of 49.1 degrees Celsius was measured in Marble Bar in northern Western Australia, which is already considered the hottest place in Australia; this was only slightly below the Australian temperature record of 50.7 degrees Celsius from January 1960. Subsequent bushfires and droughts were feared. High ozone levels were also reported. A nationwide fire ban was issued. The heatwave also affected large parts of Australia in January. At the end of January, the city of Adelaide broke its heat record from 1939 with 46.2 degrees. On January 25, the highest temperature ever recorded in a coastal location was measured in Port Augusta at 49.5 degrees. The heatwave was followed by a monsoon with partly extreme rainfall. In some areas, over 1000 mm of rain fell per square meter; northern Queensland was particularly affected. The city of Townsville had to be deliberately flooded to prevent a dam breach; 2000 houses were underwater."

The weather anomaly contributed to a debate about the climate crisis. In particular, in Australia itself, which has a comparatively high per capita greenhouse gas emission, the heatwave triggered extensive discussions in politics. Coal is Australia's second most important export product, and accordingly, the Australian coal industry, which has a strong lobby in politics, received backing from the governments of previous years, while climate change and renewable energies played no significant role in the political debate. In the settlement of Santa Teresa, about 80 kilometers southwest of Alice Springs, around 40 dead brumbies were found in dried-up waterholes. Rangers shot 55 more feral horses suffering from water shortages. In Western Australia, more than 2,500 wild camels were shot. They had broken through fences around private grazing land to access water. Uluru (Ayers Rock) was closed due to the extreme heat, yet a German tourist died of water shortage on New Year's Day. Supermarkets in Australia can no longer sell chilled goods because refrigerators are not functioning due to the heat."

                "content": "The causes of this heatwave were the persistent high-pressure system (Vera) over Europe and the slow-moving Atlantic low-pressure system (Nasir). Nasir formed around June 18 near Newfoundland and remained near Spain and England until almost the end of the month before moving eastward over Scandinavia. With a powerful southwesterly upper-level flow, an air mass from the Azores High – initially called Ulla, later referred to as the high-pressure bridge Vera from June 25 – moved into the North Sea region and then southeastward over Central Europe. As a result, hot Saharan air advanced over the Iberian Peninsula and southern France from June 23, reaching the Baltic Sea region by the end of the month. With a low-pressure system, Otto, in the Baltic region, a short-lived omega block formed over the flat pressure distribution of several lows in the Mediterranean region. Temperatures reached a peak of 46.0°C on June 28 in Vérargues, Hérault, southern France (and 45.9°C in Gallargues-le-Montueux, Gard), the highest temperature ever recorded in mainland France (previously 44.1°C in Conqueyrac, August 2003). This record was surpassed in 2019 at several measurement sites in the region. France became the seventh European country to record temperatures above 45°C. Andorra also recorded a new national record of 39.4°C in Borda Vidal on June 28 (previously 38.5°C in Andorra La Vella, July 2005). Numerous all-time records were set in various locations, including Spain, France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Croatia. Nighttime minimum temperatures also reached new all-time records at several stations. Another notable feature was the abnormally high temperatures in elevated areas, such as the Pyrenees – where the peak temperatures in southern France were also influenced by Foehn effects – and the Alps. For example, Davos (Graubünden, 1596 m) recorded a new high of 29.8°C on June 26 (previously 29.3°C in 2015), and the Schmittenhöhe (Salzburg, 1956 m) recorded 25.0°C on June 27 (previously 24.6°C in 1952). St. Martin in Passeier (South Tyrol, 586 m) reported 39.9°C on the same day. At the beginning of July, the hot air was pushed back into the Mediterranean region, with a few more hot days in the Balkans. In the Eastern Alps, for example, the midsummer weather persisted until July 7. The heatwave ended with some severe thunderstorms, such as in France and Austria, and around July 10 with the advance of cold air into Spain, the upper Adriatic, the eastern edge of the Alps, and Greece. By mid-July, more unstable weather patterns prevailed (storms in Corsica and the Southern Alps). Many areas experienced wildfires, exacerbated by drought and heat."

                "content": "The later part of July was characterized by a series of Atlantic low-pressure systems with a northeastward trajectory. Around July 18, with renewed southwesterly airflow, heat returned to Spain, and a more stable high-pressure system (Yvonne) formed over Central Europe. By July 23, with the arrival of a strong Atlantic low-pressure system, a brief omega-like weather pattern developed. In Spain and France, temperatures of over 40°C were widely recorded as early as July 23. The following days became even hotter.\n\nSeveral national weather services recorded unprecedented peak air temperatures:\nIn Germany, the stations in Duisburg-Baerl and Tönisvorst reported 41.2°C on July 25; the day before, 40.5°C had been measured in Geilenkirchen near Aachen (previously 40.3°C in Kitzingen, 2015; see also heat records in Germany) – this old record was surpassed in several locations.\nIn Belgium, 41.8°C was measured in Begijnendijk on the same day; the day before, 39.9°C was recorded in Kleine-Brogel (previously 38.8°C in Liège-Monsin, July 2015).\nIn the Netherlands, 40.7°C was recorded in Gilze en Rijen at the same time; the day before, 39.3°C was measured in Eindhoven (previously 38.6°C in Warnsveld, August 1944) – a 75-year-old record that was broken.\nIn Luxembourg, 39.0°C was also recorded on that day at the Findel-Aéroport station (previously 37.9°C there in August 2003).\nAlso on July 25, a national record of 38.7°C was measured in the United Kingdom at the Botanical Garden of the University of Cambridge (previously 38.5°C in Faversham, August 2003).\nNumerous individual locations also registered their new all-time records, including Paris, which on July 25 recorded 42.6°C, the highest value in Europe during this heatwave (Montsouris station, previously 1947). With the strong Atlantic low-pressure system moving northward toward Iceland, the heatwave in Central Europe ended as early as July 26, with stormy conditions and a significant temperature drop of up to 15°C. The subtropical warm air mass was split (low-pressure front Vincent), separated in the Baltic Sea region, and displaced by south winds over northern Scandinavia. There, the air mass merged with the current polar high and was carried westward by the Icelandic low-pressure complex, reaching East Greenland. In the Greenland Sea–Norwegian Sea area, it remained abnormally warm until the early days of August. Norway set a new all-time record of 35.6°C in Laksfors on July 27, at over 65°N, matching the nearly 40-year-old national record (Nesbyen, June 1970; significantly further south at 60°N), and also recorded tropical nights.\n\nIn central Sweden, southern Finland, and all of Estonia, temperatures above 30°C were widely measured, with Helsinki setting a new record of 33.2°C (previously 31.6°C in July 1945). In Greenland, 20.6°C was measured on July 31 in Qaarsut, located on the west coast by Baffin Bay (71°N) – a normal summer temperature there is around 10°C. The Nord station, only 900 km south of the North Pole, recorded 16.0°C. In Central Europe, the weather was instead dominated by Atlantic cold fronts and a Mediterranean low-pressure system as an offshoot. From July 26, this led to severe storms, particularly in Morocco, Catalonia, central Italy, all of Austria, the western Balkans, as well as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. The heat retreated fairly quickly from the Mediterranean region.\n\nOn the British Isles, heavy rain prevailed around the turn of the month due to the Atlantic low-pressure system."

Thessaly recorded temperatures of 40°C starting August 8, 2019,[82] Leskovac in Serbia reached 38.1°C on August 12, and Belgrade experienced five consecutive tropical nights.[83] During this time, similar peak temperatures were also measured in Ukraine. The heat slowly retreated to the southeast, with temperatures still exceeding 40°C in Turkey. Wildfires broke out again in the Mediterranean region. In the stormy zone at the edge of the Atlantic low-pressure system,[84] a tornado formed on August 9, causing severe damage in Luxembourg.[85] The front remained storm-prone over Central Europe for several days, with localized heavy rainfall.[86] Southern and Eastern Europe continued to be influenced by offshoots of the Azores High (Beatrix), with a strong low-pressure system (Bernd) over England.[87][88] Temperatures in southern Spain remained above 40°C for another week, and widespread temperatures exceeded 35°C up to the Black Sea. The front from Bernd,[88] with a small Mediterranean low-pressure system as an offshoot, led to severe storms from August 19 to 22,[88][89] with partly hurricane-like gusts, from eastern Switzerland[90] through parts of southern and central Germany[91] to the Polish-Slovak Tatra Mountains.[92]"

The focus of this heatwave, in addition to southern Spain, where peak temperatures above 40°C occurred again for several days, was the Serbia–Hungary–Poland area.

                "content": "Such intense heat so early in the year was a rarity across Europe; some countries and numerous weather stations recorded new daily maximum temperature records for June. In Poland, an 80-year-old record for peak temperature was broken (1935), in Germany a 70-year-old record (1947). In France, almost a quarter (23%) of all Meteo-France stations recorded new all-time records, and almost two-thirds (60%) recorded a June record. The beginning of June was already exceptionally hot; throughout June, there was a prevailing foehn-like south to southwest airflow. June 2019 became the warmest month ever recorded in all of Europe since the beginning of weather records (1 degree warmer than the previous record June of 1999), including in Austria (weather series since 1767), in Poland (previously June 1811), in Germany (weather series since 1881), in the Czech Republic (since 1961), and in Latvia (since 1924); it was the second warmest in Switzerland (after 2003). The minimal nighttime cooling was also remarkable; Vienna (Inner City), for example, experienced thirteen tropical nights not dropping below 20°C during the month (also a new local record for June). July was also abnormally warm but only locally a record month.\n\nA peculiarity of this heatwave was the drift of warm air to the northwest, leading to an intense ice melt event in Greenland. There, even at 3200 m (Station Summit Camp), the zero-degree threshold was exceeded for several days, which had only previously occurred in 2012. The period of the last days of June was regionally 10–6 degrees above the long-term average, mainly in France, northern Spain, northern Italy, Switzerland, western Austria, southern Germany, and the Czech Republic. As a heatwave lasting up to 7 days – slightly longer in some places – the event ranks among the 5 to 10 most intense in the longer measurement history in some regions. The second heatwave was comparable and, particularly in France, more intense than the first event, contrary to the national record set in June. The cause of the heatwaves was an excessively oscillating jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere, which then transitioned into chaotic phases. This shift of the polar front led to strong heat exchanges from the tropics to the polar regions.\n\nThe northwest and northeast of North America also recorded their hottest July, and extreme heatwaves occurred simultaneously in the USA, the Near and Middle East, and East Asia. In the Arctic belt, the abnormal dryness led to numerous wildfires. The extent of polar ice melt was in the range of record years 2012, 2002, 2007, and 2016. Globally, June was also the warmest ever recorded, 0.1° above the last record month, June 2016. July 2019 matched the previous record of July 2016 (analysis beginning in the 1980s). Like in 2016, 2019 experienced an El Niño event (but not during the intervening long European heat anomalies of summer 2017 and 2018, which each followed a La Niña event). As with every heatwave in recent years, this one is also attributed to global warming according to current research, an assumption not directly provable for individual events but a correlation (statistical probabilities). According to a 2020 study by the Institute of Physics, the results of climatological attribution research show that the short and simultaneously intense events occurring during the heatwave would have been very unlikely without human-induced climate changes. Not only the temperatures but also the precipitation levels were unusual this summer, either very high or very low: Summer 2019 was overall rated as \"extremely dry.\" Over the entire calendar year, 2019 was the warmest year in Europe since records began."

In a band from Spain through northern Italy to the Baltic region and another band from northeastern France to Sweden, there was hardly any rain in June, and in July, these areas also experienced abnormally low precipitation. There were numerous large wildfires, for example, in June in Spain (around Almorox in the Madrid metropolitan area, near Toledo, in Catalonia), in southern France (Gard department); in July in Germany (near Lübtheen in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania); in Portugal (Vila de Rei); again in southern France (Argelès-sur-Mer and Trèbes), Italy (on Sardinia), Croatia (Pag Island); in August in Greece (e.g., on Elafonisos, near Marathon) and Cyprus. On Gran Canaria, off the west coast of Africa, there were also wildfires due to the heatwave; on August 19, 3,400 hectares and on August 20, 6,000 hectares were affected. In some areas outside the Mediterranean region – where drought, especially in Spain, has already become a long-term problem – there was also water scarcity, including in northern and central Germany. The situation was particularly precarious for agriculture in parts of Poland and the Baltic region, where prolonged drought threatened significant crop failures. At the beginning of July, Lithuania declared a national emergency. Severe weather also caused significant damage. Another consequence of the heatwaves is extensive forest damage, with causes rooted in the droughts of previous years, such as mass infestations of bark beetles and other forest damage patterns. In Germany, the discussion about forest dieback became relevant again."

At the peak of the episode, more than three-quarters of France were under a heatwave alert. Fifty-four French departments were placed at the orange level, from Midi-Pyrénées to the northeast. More impressively, the 15 departments of Haute-Normandie, Hauts-de-France, and Île-de-France were placed on RED alert from Friday, August 7, to Tuesday, August 11. This heatwave was an exceptionally significant climatic event that occurred in August 2020. These episodes of intense heat are the most widespread since records began. Numerous temperature records were set. An initial heat peak occurred on July 30 and 31, with the heat arriving from the southwest and then moving toward the western and eastern regions. On July 30, temperatures of 41.9°C were recorded in Socoa (a new absolute heat record), 40.6°C in Cazaux (monthly record), and 38.3°C in Royan (monthly record). The next day, temperatures of 41.3°C were recorded in Vichy, 39.4°C in Nevers, and 37.9°C in Boulogne-sur-Mer. The heat then shifted toward the southeast, and temperatures eventually returned to more bearable levels. However, this respite was only temporary as a new, longer heatwave arrived on August 6. Numerous monthly and even absolute heat records were set on August 7 in western France, with 41.9°C in Bellis in the Landes (absolute record), 39.8°C in Cognac, 39.6°C in Nantes, and 33.4°C in Cherbourg (monthly records). Temperatures then dropped in the west, but the heat intensified in the north and east of the country. August 8 and 9 were the hottest days in northern and eastern France. On August 8, the mercury reached 37.1°C in Lille (monthly record). Also noteworthy on the same day were minimum temperatures of 25.2°C in Boulogne-sur-Mer and 22.2°C in Alençon (absolute records). The next day, temperatures reached 39.3°C in Creil and 38.4°C in Rouen (monthly records). The temperature did not drop below 23°C in Lille (monthly record) or 21.4°C in Beauvais (absolute record). On August 10, the heatwave lost some intensity but remained quite strong. It was not until August 13 that the heatwave subsided, with the arrival of numerous storms. On a national scale, this episode was shorter and less intense than that of 2003, but in some departments, it was of an intensity close to or even locally exceeding that of 2003 (for example, in Lille, where the average temperature over seven days exceeded by 1°C the highest average temperature recorded over seven days in 2003). The first half of this August was the second hottest ever recorded (though far behind 2003), and this August was the third hottest ever recorded, with a 2°C excess compared to the 1981–2010 average, behind 2003 (+4.2°C) and 1997 (+2.1°C). It would later be surpassed by August 2022. The heatwave is estimated to have caused 1,900 deaths."

But this high intensity led to the RED heatwave alert being triggered in Belgium for the first time in history. The record in Uccle was 35.9°C. However, this record had been surpassed on July 31, with 36.5°C, making it the third hottest day ever recorded in Uccle.

At the cold pole of the (inhabited) Earth (Verkhoyansk), temperatures of up to 38 degrees Celsius were measured. This value was reached on June 20, 2020, and recognized by the WMO in 2021. The record temperature was caused by warm air masses from the southern continental temperate climate zone in the region and a large high-pressure area. Even the winter of 2019/20 and the spring of 2020 were exceptionally mild/warm.\n\nAccording to Anders Levermann from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, temperatures in Siberia from January to May 2020 were about 7 degrees Celsius higher than usual. This is a completely new, previously unexplained phenomenon; the jet stream cannot explain it (quote: it \"lasts only one to two weeks, not five months\"). The heatwave is associated with global warming in the Arctic (see also the consequences of global warming in the Arctic). A group of European scientists from the World Weather Attribution published the results of an investigation of various climate models on the current climate events in Siberia on July 15, 2020. They attribute the heatwave to human influences. The warming of Siberia is such an extreme climate event that even considering climate change, it would only occur every 130 years; without climate change, such an extreme weather event would occur only about every 80,000 years. Humans increase the likelihood of such heatwaves by 600 times through greenhouse gas emissions. As a result of the extreme heat, thawing of the permafrost is being observed. The diesel oil disaster near Norilsk is to be considered a consequence of the heatwave. In 2020, as in 2019 and 2021, there were exceptionally many and large wildfires in Siberia."

It is notable that the number of deaths was more than double that of the second deadliest heatwave, an extremely strong one that struck central Greece in August 1958 and killed 600 people, mainly in Thessaly. The maximum temperature recorded at the National Observatory of Athens, in the center of Athens, was 41.9°C on July 23, and in Nea Filadelfeia, it was 43.6°C on July 27, which was the highest recorded in the Athens area. These temperatures were combined with high minimums, the highest being 30.2°C in central Athens on July 27 and 29.9°C on July 24 in Nea Filadelfeia. The lowest minimum was 25.6°C in central Athens. Additionally, humidity was high (60% in Athens on July 23), and wind speeds were low, contributing to discomfort even during the night. The first deaths—nine in total—were recorded in Athens on July 22, and the number began to rise rapidly each day. On July 23, 12 people died, on July 24 another 95, and on July 25 another 250, causing burial issues. By July 26, the total number of victims had reached 900, with 180 more added on July 27 and another 200 on July 28. It is estimated that 400 elderly people died helplessly. Although the heatwave also affected other cities, such as Thessaloniki and Larissa, it is considered that the discomfort was more intense in Athens due to the presence of photochemical smog, which had worsened due to temperature inversions caused by a high-pressure system that simultaneously moved in from the Sahara."

In this initial stage, the unusual heat did not affect the Canary Islands, Galicia, the western Cantabrian coast, and parts of the Mediterranean peninsular coast. Initially, Aemet forecasted that the heatwave would last until Wednesday, June 15, without ruling out the possibility of it continuing for the rest of the week. On June 11, high temperatures were already recorded in the southwest of the peninsula, with 41°C in Seville. Alerts remained active for Aragón, Castilla y León, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, and Madrid at the yellow level, and orange for Extremadura and Andalusia. However, the meteorological conditions did not meet the official criteria to declare the start of the heatwave. On June 12, thermometers recorded 43.2°C in Almadén (Ciudad Real), the highest value on the official start day of the heatwave. Temperatures above 40°C were also recorded at 47 Aemet network stations. Additionally, the agency issued special notice number 3/2022 with information about the phenomenon, its forecast, and announced the start of the national plan for preventive actions against the effects of excessive temperatures on health, including a level assignment map. In the province of Almería, a 62-year-old man died after collapsing and showing symptoms of dehydration while hiking on the Antenas trail near the Totem of Aguadulce. On June 13, Aemet announced in its official report a possible end date for the heatwave on Thursday, June 16, while noting that \"due to the behavior of a DANA (isolated depression at high levels) located in Madeira, whose evolution cannot be precisely determined.\" On June 14, the heatwave extended to southern Galicia and the interior of the Cantabrian region. Tropical nights also continued, with thermometers not dropping below 20°C in many provinces, particularly in Jaén, where a minimum of 27°C was expected. Furthermore, it was forecasted that the peak of the heatwave would be reached on Friday, June 17, breaking some temperature records in cities like Zaragoza, Lleida, and Córdoba. The only areas in Spain that had so far escaped the heatwave were Asturias, the Canary Islands, and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. In its daily report, Aemet forecasted the end of the meteorological episode for Saturday, as the DANA in the Atlantic, which injects hot African air, approached the peninsula, causing instability and a drop in temperatures. In Vega de Valcarce, a 69-year-old German pilgrim possibly died from heatstroke while walking the Villafranca del Bierzo stage of the Camino de Santiago. Rubén del Campo, Aemet spokesperson, stated that it was the \"most intense heatwave for mid-June in at least the last 20 years.\" On June 15, the \"Iberian exception\" was applied for the first time, whereby the regulated price of electricity is calculated with a cap on gas for its generation. The PVPC (Voluntary Price for Small Consumers) means higher electricity bills due to compensation for thermal power plants and increased use of gas and coal during the heatwave. Once this unusual heatwave subsides, it will be seen if PVPC-referenced bills decrease when all air conditioners are no longer running simultaneously. On June 18, the extraordinary heatwave that affected Spain between June 11-12 and June 18 came to an end, being described as \"intense, extensive, and extraordinary\" by the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET), which also highlighted that this spring heat episode was one of the earliest recorded in the country. On June 20, Monday until 12 p.m., the Zaragoza City Council extended the orange alert of the Civil Protection Emergency Plan for the heatwave, which had been activated on Tuesday, June 14, due to the high temperatures affecting the city, exceeding 40°C on several days and not dropping below 25°C on some nights. On July 6, the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) published a report detailing the month of June, highlighting the intense heat episode that extended from the first day of the month until June 19, with both maximum and minimum temperatures well above normal, particularly high during the central days of the month, due to an invasion of warm air from North Africa. The heatwave in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands between June 11 and 18, 2022, was the earliest occurrence in the series, matching records with the one that occurred on June 11, 1981."

On June 15, the UKHSA issued level 3 alerts for London, the East, and the Southeast of England, maintaining level 2 alerts for the East Midlands and the Southwest of England. According to the Met Office forecasts, the heat peak would arrive on Friday, reaching the threshold necessary for the consideration of a heatwave, before temperatures dropped significantly on Saturday the 18th. On June 17, London exceeded 32°C on the hottest day of the year so far. According to Stephen Dixon, a Met Office spokesperson, temperatures above 30 degrees \"are not unusual, but it is uncommon to see such high temperatures so early in the year.\" Dixon added that the temperatures on that same day would be the highest since the summer of 2020."

The episode began on Sunday, June 12, 2022, when temperatures above 40°C were recorded at 47 stations of the State Meteorological Agency (Aemet) network, located in Andalusia, Extremadura, and Castilla-La Mancha. This heatwave follows two other related climatic episodes in Spain in 2022: the widespread drought in the winter of 2021-2022 and the hottest May of the 21st century. The heat caused hundreds of swift chicks to prematurely leave their nests, falling to the ground as they did not know how to fly. The Seville-based NGO Ecourbe, dedicated to biodiversity conservation, reported that up to one hundred chicks were collected from the ground in a single day in Córdoba and Seville. Comisiones Obreras of Extremadura demanded that the reduction of the workday by one hour for construction workers be brought forward, as this reduction is applied from July 15 to mid-August. On June 15, the Madrid City Council activated the red alert protocol for meteorology, given the forecast of a combination of temperatures above 35°C and wind gusts of more than 55 km/h, and consequently closed nine parks in the Spanish capital. The high temperatures, along with the drought, created conditions of extreme risk for forest fires throughout peninsular Spain, except for Galicia, most of the border with Portugal, and isolated points along the coast. A fire in the Sierra de la Culebra (Zamora) forced the evacuation of eight municipalities, while another fire in the province of Toledo led to the evacuation of 3,200 people from the Puy du Fou España theme park. High temperatures in schools caused an increase in dizziness and fainting among children. Families, teachers, and experts called for a plan to adapt schools to future heatwaves, which they will face if no action is taken for the next school year. Air conditioning should be the last resort to lower temperatures in schools, as it accelerates climate change, which in the coming years will cause more frequent and extreme heatwaves. The Community of Madrid manages four public swimming pools in the capital. Until Thursday, June 16, the intention was to keep them closed until the end of June. Swimming in pools alleviates the unpleasant thermal sensation caused by extreme heat, so public complaints led the Sports Councilor, Marta Rivera de La Cruz, to change the plan for opening these public pools. She apologized to the people of Madrid: \"It is true that the heatwave should have brought forward that opening.\" She announced that next year they will open at the beginning of the month, as was historically done until 2019. On Monday, June 20, hospitals in Zaragoza recorded an \"unusual peak\" in emergencies due to the heatwave. Some patients had to wait more than 60 hours to be admitted due to a lack of beds, with conditions caused in elderly and chronically ill people by the prolonged heatwave of the previous week. This new workload due to the heatwave adds to the burden that hospital emergency staff have been enduring for more than two years."

A few hours later, it generated a strong winter storm,[1] which affected a vast area of Portugal and half of the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula.[2] The result of local situations, with short spatial and temporal dimensions, was associated with strong vertical instability of the troposphere and the consequent cloud cells with significant vertical development (such as tornadoes and downbursts, or generalized to a larger area, lasting several hours.[1]"

The jet stream, in the upper troposphere (300 hPa), exhibited the highest speeds of 230-240 km/h, between 35º and 40º North latitude, over the Azores.\n\nA few hours later, at 00h on the 15th, the low-pressure area underwent an amplification of a cyclonic wave in the altitude flow (geopotential at 500 hPa), generating a baroclinic wave between the Azores and the Iberian Peninsula. This, due to the strong dynamism of polar air (of Greenlandic origin) on the western flank of the trough and the intensification of convergence in the lower and middle levels of the troposphere on the eastern flank of the trough (due to increased cyclonic vorticity), triggered a process of strong cyclogenesis in the Atlantic west of mainland Portugal. By early afternoon (12h UTC) on the 15th, there was an increase in vertical wave amplitude, intensifying strongly over mainland Portugal and the adjacent Atlantic, resulting in cyclogenesis, which took on characteristics of explosive cyclogenesis. By definition, a cyclogenesis situation is termed explosive when atmospheric pressure drops by at least 1 hPa per hour over a 24-hour period (for a latitude of 60º, the pressure drop value may be slightly lower for 40º latitude). The stormy wind speeds (from the east) observed are due to the combination of strong cyclogenic activity with the approach and passage of a very active cold frontal surface. Throughout the afternoon, the center of the frontal disturbance, on its northeastward path and still in the deepening phase, was located at 18h UTC over northwest Portugal and Galicia, with a minimum surface pressure of 950 hPa. However, just a few hours later, during the rapid filling phase, at 00h UTC on February 16, the center of the disturbance was already near Brittany and significantly less deep (975 hPa at the surface) and filled, becoming part of a vast complex Atlantic depression, a normal and frequent situation at this time of year at these latitudes."

Many of the fatalities, especially in Lisbon, Alhandra, Sesimbra, and Alhos Vedros, were likely due to drowning caused by floods that occurred in the riverside areas. These floods are believed to have resulted from the combination of multiple factors, among which the sea level rise or storm surge stands out. This rise refers to the temporary increase in sea level caused by abnormal meteorological conditions, particularly variations in atmospheric pressure and/or the action of strong and prolonged winds. Several railway disruptions were also reported, caused by accidents, some of which resulted in fatalities (e.g., Lamarosa/Coimbra: train collision with 2 fatalities; between Travagem and Leandro/Minho, due to a fallen tree, 3 deaths). The road and electrical networks were also affected, mainly due to fallen trees. Hundreds of boats are believed to have sunk, and the damage to forests amounted to hundreds of thousands of uprooted trees. In popular culture, it became known as the year of forty-one, the day the wind swept everything away, leaving no roof untouched by its force. From the perspective of the regime's response to this natural disaster, it was carried out through the Subsecretariat of State for Social Assistance, which presided over the National Relief Commission for Cyclone Victims. This commission was formed by government initiative, aiming to address the needs of small family economies ruined by the catastrophe, particularly concerning the need for food, the recovery of their homes, and work tools. To raise funds, a propaganda campaign was designed by the Estado Novo through the National Broadcaster and some newspapers, such as Diário de Notícias. This was one of the first contributions of the then newly created Subsecretariat of State for Social Assistance as the coordinator of the Estado Novo's social policy."

The wind and water were the main causes of the damage, which resulted in deaths, power outages, fallen trees, and blocked roads. The storm, which also affected the Valencian Community and Catalonia, reached Mallorca on November 10 from the Arctic and was the most significant in the western Mediterranean in fifty years. There were four fatalities, more than 150,000 trees fell, causing a significant deforestation impact, 65% of the road network was blocked, more than 175,000 families were left without electricity at home, and classes were suspended for the entire week. During the storm, up to 250 liters per square meter of rain fell in certain areas, and winds reached 150 km/h. The most violent part of the storm subsided on the evening of November 12, but bad weather continued until November 15. The storm affected the entire island. In Palma and Calvià, there were two fatalities, and another in Alcúdia; in Sóller, the most rain fell, while the entire Llevant coast and the Bay of Alcúdia experienced strong winds and gusts. The most affected municipality was Pollença. However, snow only fell above 900 meters and was scarce. All ports in the Balearic Islands and the Llevant coast were closed during the most intense days of the storm. The losses were in the millions, valued at 37 million euros, mainly affecting the primary sector as the storm devastated farmland. The storm also caused damage to heritage sites, with the necropolises of Son Real and Illot dels Porros and the Talayotic sanctuary of Punta del Patró in Son Real suffering significant damage. The sanctuary, excavated that same summer, was almost completely destroyed, while at the necropolis of Illot, several slabs were displaced, and at Punta dels Fenicis, the bones from tombs that had not yet been excavated were exposed."

It caused numerous material damages and spectacularly devastated large forest areas, but there were no serious injuries. Meteorologically, it was a squall accompanied by a downburst and one or two waterspouts, with heavy rain and hailstones of considerable diameter. The most affected areas were the municipalities of Banyalbufar and Esporles and, to a lesser extent, Valldemossa; specifically, the storm hit the area between the road connecting Banyalbufar with Esporles and the sea, particularly the Port del Canonge area, as well as the vicinity of Son Cabaspre. Both the Banyalbufar road and the Port del Canonge road remained closed, the latter for two days, and both localities were without telecommunications or electricity until a generator was brought in. Regarding people, a family and a group of workers had to be rescued, but there were no serious injuries. Among the damages caused, in addition to disruptions to the electrical and telephone networks and roads, there were numerous rockfalls, collapsed walls, broken tiles and windows, damage to buildings of great heritage value (such as the church of Banyalbufar, the Baronia, and the houses of Son Bunyola and Son Coll), and widespread flooding that ruined crops not only in the most impacted area but also in corners across the island. Specifically, a large part of the season's vineyard and olive production was lost, and many greenhouses were damaged. In the Banyalbufar area, depending on the property, crop losses were estimated between 50% and 90%. The Banyalbufar City Council requested the declaration of a disaster area, but it was ultimately not granted."

The estimated amount of damage ranks the storm among the worst natural disasters in the Podbořany area. Meteorologists initially believed that the damage in Stebno and its surroundings was caused by a weaker tornado, but after several days, they determined the cause to be a strong downburst, a descending current of cold air. The occurrence of a strong downburst and significant material damage to property remained overshadowed in the media by the extreme tornado in the Břeclav and Hodonín regions and the extensive damage it caused."

According to Meteopress, the storm lasted 4 hours, while Jan Sulan from the Plzeň station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ) estimated its duration at approximately seven hours. The storm originated around 2 p.m., approximately 80 km northeast of Nuremberg. This extremely powerful storm entered the Czech Republic after 3 p.m. in the area between Dylení and Cheb, over the Český les nature park. The storm maintained a northeast direction and moved at a speed of approximately 70 km/h. It was accompanied by heavy hailstorms; for example, in the vicinity of Dolní Žandov, large accumulations of hail were left on the meadows after its passage. The storm passed through Mariánské Lázně around 4 p.m. with torrential rain and hailstorms, with some hailstones exceeding two centimeters in size. Rainfall on the slopes of the Úšovický stream valley, where the spa town is located, soon caused a local flood on the Main Street. Water mixed with hail rose on the streets to a height of several tens of centimeters. The hailstorm lasted approximately 10 minutes. The storm continued through Toužim, passed through Lubenec, where 17 mm of rainfall was recorded in ten minutes. In the Podbořany region, the storm with very strong gusty winds passed between 4:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. from the forest above Blatno, through Blatno itself, and continued through the Podvinecký stream valley in a northeast direction towards Stebno. In Blatno, the storm caused a whiteout that lasted approximately 15 minutes. The storm's passage through Stebno, according to residents, lasted only a few minutes, during which everything was enveloped in a white fog caused by the ongoing downburst. Residents reported that everything happened so quickly that they didn’t even have time to close their doors. The strong wind carried hail, roof tiles, and bricks against windows, breaking them and sending debris inside. The storm left behind a layer of hail up to 20 cm thick in the Stebno area. The storm, with a persistent downburst, continued towards nearby Petrohrad. Meteorologists estimated wind speeds of up to 200 km/h based on the recorded damage, corresponding to hurricane-force winds on the Beaufort scale. In the village of Lubenec, 17 mm of rainfall was measured within 10 minutes. The storm partially affected the Děčín region as well. The storm began to dissipate in the area behind Rakovník and vanished around 6 p.m. in the region of the Ústí nad Labem and Central Bohemian Region borders, with various sources reporting its dissipation near Štětí, beyond Kralupy nad Vltavou, or before Mladá Boleslav."

                "content": "Several meteorologists from the branch of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ) in Ústí nad Labem gradually commented on the events in the Podbořany region. According to Jana Ehertová's statement the day after the storm, everything in Stebno indicated the passage of a smaller tornado, and based on information from residents, her colleague Radek Tomšů also considered the possibility of a tornado, but field investigation was necessary to confirm it. Meteorologists estimated the tornado's strength at level three, later revising it to the first or second level of the enhanced Fujita scale. Even before conducting a field survey, meteorologist Martin Novák noted the rarity of tornadoes in the Ústí region according to statistics, as tornadoes are more likely to form and persist over smooth and flat terrain, whereas the Ústí region is predominantly hilly. Meteorologist Radek Tomšů conducted a local investigation on Friday, June 25, during which he leaned towards an extremely strong storm with hail. On Saturday, June 26, he confirmed obtaining photographs and announced a planned investigation using the Doppler radar. On Monday, June 28, Tomšů identified a strong downburst, the fall of cold air from the rear side of a storm cloud, as the most likely cause of the damage in Stebno and surrounding villages. Since it was a storm with a large amount of precipitation, it was classified as a wet downburst. The day after the downburst determination, TV Nova reported a funnel cloud as the cause of the damage in Stebno. Damage caused by a strong downburst resembles tornado damage and is similarly intense, but the two phenomena behave differently. While in a tornado, air spirals around the vortex funnel and moves inward and upward, in a downburst, strong winds caused by the descent of heavy air originate from a point source above the ground, rush sharply downward to the surface, and upon contact with the terrain, spread radially, i.e., straight in all directions from the point of contact, with the main impact directed in the direction of the storm's movement ahead of the storm cloud. The point source is the storm, in which heavy cold air accumulates. The air descent is often accompanied by heavy precipitation, hail, and noticeable wind gusts."

The most damaged was a new building on the edge of the village, which was expected to be demolished, but even for it, the structural engineer allowed repairs, and none of the damaged residential houses will be demolished. Through damaged roofs and windows broken by hail, water and hailstones entered the houses, together destroying or damaging the structures of the houses (thermal insulation, plasterboards, ceilings, floors, plaster) and their interior equipment. Dozens of farm buildings were variously damaged, sixteen barns collapsed, some buildings had walls knocked down by the wind, garages were damaged or roofless, and cars and tractors were damaged or buried. Probably the greatest damage, estimated at 15 million crowns, was suffered by Mr. Opat on his farm, as the broken walls will likely require the entire structure to be demolished. The electrical grid was damaged, with some poles falling. Rainwater on the surrounding fields flowed with topsoil into gardens, many of which are destroyed. Some of the damages are not covered by insurance or state aid, including damaged barns, equipment, tools buried under collapsed walls or roofs, and destroyed greenhouses. Some properties are not insured for replacement value. Repairs to partially damaged special roofing materials, which are no longer manufactured, are also complicated. The storm damaged the roof of the Church of St. John the Baptist, with most of the windows missing after the storm. Damage to the church, which was already in poor condition before the storm, is estimated at several million. The old park on the village square, considered a pride of the locals, was destroyed, including the pergola. All the trees in the park are damaged, many mature trees were broken and fallen. For example, the spruce alley and others around the church did not withstand the storm; according to a witness, the square was covered by trees lying on top of each other, with only lower trees and shrubs surviving. A wall in the cemetery collapsed, and some of the monuments fell. The property of the town of Kryry was insured, but the insurance did not cover public roads and greenery; the mayor, Brda, estimated the damage to municipal property a month after the storm at 28 million crowns. The need to repair the damage caused by the downburst will lead to changes in plans for the construction of a children's playground. The village was cut off from the world after the storm, with fallen trees on all access roads, and similarly, the recreational area was cut off. The forest on Baba Hill on the eastern edge of the village was cut down, but the damage was limited to the strip of the storm's path. The red-marked tourist trail was buried under fallen trees. Trees around Prošek's mill, called Na Nouzi, south of Stebno, were heavily damaged by the storm, some broken and twisted, others snapped by the strong wind; about twenty alders fell into the pond – according to the forester, 200–300 m³ of wood was damaged. The day after the storm, the mayor of Kryry, Miroslav Brda, reported preliminary damage of 100 million crowns, which is more than the annual budget of the entire town of Kryry. He anticipated that the consequences of the storm would take months to repair. By the end of August 2021, the total damage amounted to 150 million crowns."

Firefighters cut their way to the passengers and rescued them without injury. Děkov: Some cellars in the village were flooded with water, which was subsequently pumped out by firefighters. Dolní Žandov: A tree partially fell on a family house, and another fell in the cemetery. Drmoul: A tree fell on a parked car. Trees fell in many other places in the Karlovy Vary region, such as near Dolní Žandov, Lázně Kynžvart, around Mariánské Lázně, near Teplá, Otročín, or Žlutice."

Hailstorms destroyed crops in the fields around the mentioned villages. For example, the Petrohrad company had 150 hectares of wheat, 50 hectares of rapeseed, and 30 hectares of corn damaged by 85 to 100 percent. Private farmer Roman Opat farms on 214 hectares, and half of the fields were completely destroyed; the damaged crops were suitable for plowing under. According to the district agrarian chamber of Louny, over 100 hectares of hop fields were damaged in the path of the downburst in the Louny district. According to the Union of Hop Growers of the Czech Republic, the storm, along with others in June and July, almost completely destroyed the hop harvest on approximately 300 hectares of hop fields, with a total of 900 hectares of hop fields damaged. Hailstorms with hailstones several centimeters in diameter battered the plants, leaving bare stems without leaves. The damages are estimated in the tens of millions of crowns. In addition to the areas around Stebno and Petrohrad, damages to hop fields also occurred in the Rakovník and Litoměřice regions. The damages to the harvest should not affect the supply of hops to breweries, production, or the price of beer."

                "content": "Immediately after the storm, the operations center of the Fire Rescue Service of the Ústí Region dispatched all professional and volunteer firefighter units from the surrounding area to the affected villages of Blatno, Stebno, and Petrohrad. Dozens of firefighters were deployed almost continuously for several days. Firefighters first had to cut paths into the villages through barriers of fallen trees. The coordination of the cleanup efforts was taken over by the commanding officer of the firefighters, Karel Spurný, the commander of the Kryry Volunteer Fire Department. In addition to firefighters, city employees from Kryry and energy workers participated in the damage removal in Stebno, working even during heavy rains. One ČEZ worker was struck by an electric current the day after the storm and was taken to the hospital, his life saved by volunteer firefighter Karel Spurný Jr. One of the priorities was clearing roads to allow ambulances to pass if needed. On the night from Thursday to Friday, a hundred firefighters from dozens of fire units worked on damage removal, responding to about thirty incidents, but according to the firefighters' own assessment, even this level of assistance was insufficient. Residents tried to secure residential houses against rain and clear debris from collapsed buildings, assisted by relatives. Repairs or demolitions of farm buildings are still pending. According to Miroslav Brda, the mayor of Kryry, people from the surrounding area came to the village, hindering rescuers. On Friday, June 25, over 120 firefighters were helping in Stebno, and a structural engineer inspected the damaged houses. Energy workers were working to restore electricity supplies but anticipated that the village would remain without power even on the night of Saturday. Volunteer firefighters cleared the only access road to the recreational area near Stebno, several hundred meters long, which was also blocked by fallen trees, and removed fallen trees in the forests around Stebno. On Saturday, June 26, the number of firefighters decreased to about 70 from 10 volunteer fire units, 4 units of the Fire Rescue Service of the Ústí Region, 3 units of the Fire Rescue Service of the Plzeň Region, and the Rescue Unit of Zbiroh. The removal of fallen trees, metal sheets, and parts of roofs from torn-off structures continued. On Saturday, the Kryry Volunteer Fire Department declared Stebno sufficiently safe for volunteers to join the assistance on-site and invited them for Sunday. On Sunday, June 27, firefighters from 27 fire protection units cleared debris, covered roofs, and cut damaged trees; due to the high number of firefighter units, a special fire alarm level was declared. The village was monitored by the Czech Police, who ensured order and secured properties in the absence of functional public lighting. On Monday, June 28, 70 people, including volunteer firefighters, members of the Ústí municipal police, residents of correctional facilities, and 30 city employees from Kryry, participated in the cleanup, with the total number of people involved in damage removal since the beginning estimated by Mayor Brda at around 600. According to the affected residents, there were still too few volunteers helping on Monday. On Tuesday, June 29, students and teachers from the Žatec Gymnasium joined the cleanup efforts in Stebno, and a large part of the village was cleaned up on the same day. From the end of June, 10 convicted women from the Drahonice prison participated in the volunteer cleanup, commuting to Stebno for a month to perform tasks such as sorting and cleaning bricks, cleaning, and loading branches. After completing rescue and cleanup operations, the Fire Rescue Service of the Ústí Region concluded its activities in Stebno on the evening of July 2. On Saturday, July 3, several dozen volunteers helped with the cleanup. Volunteers finished assisting the people and the village on July 9, as public spaces were cleaned, destroyed trees were cut and removed, and debris and waste were cleared. Any further volunteer assistance should only be provided with prior agreement. Mining rescuers from the Mine Rescue Station in Kladno–Libušín cleared a path to Proškov Mill on the Podvinecký Stream south of Stebno. They subsequently processed broken and fallen trees around the mill and removed trees that had fallen into the pond. Over 1,000 volunteers participated in the cleanup and other assistance. The cleared debris and waste are estimated at 15,000 tons, with not all collapsed barns removed as of July 11. The city of Kryry did not request assistance from the Czech Army, believing it could handle the storm's aftermath on its own, but later reports mentioned soldiers from the Czech Army removing debris with heavy equipment. At the end of September 2021, Mayor Miroslav Brda stated that funds from a public collection were used to clean up a massive waste dump, with the cleanup costing two million crowns. In October 2021, the demolition of irreparable parts of barns was still ongoing. During the ongoing removal of windthrows around Stebno and Blatno, some of the damaged wood was chipped, but there was no market for the resulting piles of wood chips."

                "content": "Experts state that people affected by a disaster initially experience a heroic phase. Adrenaline associated with rescue efforts, securing property, meeting basic needs, and general activity in the village affects the affected individuals. People have enough energy and determination to handle the adverse situation. This phase lasts one to two weeks and usually ends with the departure of rescuers, damage mitigators, and volunteers, when the disaster area calms down. Then, fatigue and anxiety begin to weigh on the affected individuals, and they start to fully realize the impacts of the disaster. Fear for life during the disaster can lead to the later development of post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychological help was offered to the residents of Stebno by the firefighters already on the scene. On Thursday, July 1, a post-traumatic team from the Fire Rescue Service of the Ústí Region arrived in Stebno, Blatno, and Petrohrad to provide psychosocial assistance. Subsequently, this assistance was ensured by the Spirála association, which will remain in contact with selected families for up to one year after the event. The Spirála association provided more intensive assistance in Stebno during July, but its activities were already reduced in August. In the third week of July, volunteers from several organizations, such as the Czech Red Cross, helped local people cope with the trauma. According to volunteers, the affected individuals sometimes hesitated to ask for help due to the feeling that others were worse off—volunteers therefore identified those in need directly in the field. When introducing workers at damaged homes, mentions of psychological help were omitted due to the negative stigma of psychological assistance in the Czech Republic. The people of Stebno experienced shock and fear for their lives during the storm itself, as the downburst struck completely unexpectedly (unlike, for example, floods); some perceived it as the end of the world or expected their death. The aftermath of the storm undermined the mental health of the residents, with local elderly women coping poorly with the event. According to Mayor M. Brda, depression from the shock and damage began to affect the residents of Stebno as early as Saturday, June 26. Two weeks after the storm, locals were physically exhausted, and their mental health deteriorated, partly due to fears of uncertainty about the coming days. Adults experienced bouts of sorrow and cried, breakdowns occurred, children were afraid to sleep alone in their rooms, and teenagers were scared during storms. People across age groups had trouble falling asleep and sleeping; for example, one affected resident had recurring memories of the storm and therefore slept poorly. Spirála workers also worked with a five-year-old child who began wetting themselves after the storm."

                "content": "After the cleanup, which primarily took place until Sunday, June 27, residents began undertaking more extensive repairs to their properties. By mid-July, residents had usually completed work on damaged houses that they could carry out themselves or with the help of firefighters and volunteers. A persistent problem for further restoration was the unavailability of craftsmen, such as roofers, carpenters, glaziers, and building materials for roofs. For example, a roofing company from Vroutek repaired three roofs in the village but then returned to previously agreed-upon contracts. Many damaged roofs remained temporarily covered with tarps by mid-July, and residents hoped to complete roof repairs before the onset of winter. The execution of construction work was complicated by almost daily rains until mid-July. According to Eliška Ratiborská, coordinator of People in Need, a month after the storm, most owners of damaged roofs had secured materials for their repair. At the same time, one of the affected residents stated that she was still drying soaked walls in her house and waiting for a craftsman to repair the roof. The last of the damaged residential houses in Stebno was roofed on September 5, 2021, with the speed of work affected by the absence of consistent sunny weather without rain. Smaller interior repairs may continue. According to Tomáš Ratiborský, chairman of the STEBNO 2020 Beautification Association, Stebno should take advantage of the necessary restoration and propose comprehensive modifications with experts in architecture, urban planning, and dendrology. If sufficient funds were available for the restoration of the village's public space, Ratiborský suggested that residents should avoid self-help and amateur creativity. At the Kryry city council meeting held at the end of August 2021, an architect presented a possible design for Stebno's village square and grant programs suitable for financing the restoration. The city of Kryry plans to restore the square at a cost of 5.5 million crowns, divided into three phases, with part of the expenses to be covered by donations raised in a public collection, and it also hopes to receive contributions from foundations. On Saturday, September 25, a new children's playground was opened on the square, replacing the one destroyed during the storm. The playground, worth half a million crowns, was 80% funded by a grant from the Ministry for Regional Development and the city of Kryry's resources. During the ceremonial opening, two studies for the restoration of Stebno were presented. A study of the Green Square around the church was prepared by landscape architects. They propose planting new horse chestnuts and linden trees, with the first trees expected to be planted in the fall of 2021. A gazebo for residents' gatherings is to be rebuilt, the existing fire reservoir is to be converted into an ornamental pond, and the streambed running through the square is to be reconstructed. A memorial in the form of a small bell tower is also planned to commemorate the natural disaster. The repair of the damaged cemetery wall is scheduled for spring 2022."

                "content": "The state was ready on June 25, the day after the storm, through the Labor Office in Louny to provide extraordinary financial assistance of up to nearly 58,000 CZK. According to the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Jana Maláčová, 22 applications for extraordinary assistance were processed within a few days, and nearly 614,000 CZK were paid out. The State Land Office released 100 million CZK from the budget for land adjustments on June 25 for quick assistance to people and municipalities, intended for the restoration of infrastructure such as water and sewage systems. The company Lesy České republiky promised assistance to people from municipalities affected by the tornado, providing up to 50 m³ of timber for a new roof, including transportation to the nearest sawmill, or a donation of 100,000 CZK, and also offering each affected household 20 m³ of firewood. Lesy ČR estimates the cost of assistance at 150–200 million CZK. On the invitation of MP Pavel Růžička, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš visited Stebno on Saturday, June 26. The Prime Minister wished the residents strength and thanked the firefighters for their efforts. He confirmed material assistance from Lesy ČR for Stebno and other state aid, similar to that for affected municipalities in the Hodonín region. The mayor of Kryry, Miroslav Brda, welcomed the promise of assistance but will wait for its real form. According to MP Růžička, the Prime Minister's visit showed donors that help is needed not only in Moravia. The Prime Minister announced a visit by the Minister for Regional Development Klára Dostálová and the Minister of Agriculture Miroslav Toman on Wednesday, June 30. The Ministry of Agriculture prepared support for farmers, foresters, water managers, and food producers by launching the Framework Program for Risk and Crisis Management in Agriculture. It will compensate for damages caused to fields, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, forest stands, animals, agricultural machinery, farm buildings, and equipment. Compensation will be provided up to 100% of the incurred damages, with state compensation reduced by insurance payments made by insurers. The extent of damage to agricultural property caused by the downburst and tornado in South Moravia was estimated at 1.5 billion CZK, the same amount was prepared within the mentioned program. The government approved the program on Monday, June 28, and farmers operating in the villages of Bílenec, Blatno, Černčice, Krty, Malměřice, Petrohrad, and Stebno could submit applications to SZIF from July 12 to August 17, 2021. Compensation for damages amounting to 627 million CZK will be distributed among 81 applicants, with 73 applications concerning damages in South Moravia. The Ministry for Regional Development will provide support to residents affected by the storms from the Živel SFPI program, created to help people affected by the tornado in Moravia and the downburst in Bohemia. From this program, they can receive a non-repayable grant of up to 2 million CZK for home restoration and borrow an additional 3 million CZK in the form of a favorable loan. For demolition or project preparation, residents could receive an advance of half a million CZK within 7 days, even before signing the grant agreement. Minister Dostálová anticipated that a two-million CZK grant would suffice for all affected residents to reconstruct their homes. On Saturday, July 3, fund officials helped residents in the village directly with filling out grant applications and recording damages, completing 39 applications on-site. Residents of Stebno pointed out the problem of destroyed uninhabitable buildings, which they needed to repair or rebuild to have space for storing equipment used for business or garden care. By early August, SFPI received 26 applications from Stebno, but none included the necessary cost estimate for property repairs (which can only be prepared by experts). In mid-September, MPs voted to increase the budget of the State Investment Support Fund by 1.8 billion to 5.24 billion CZK. Controversy arose over the government's decision to reduce state support by insurance payments and donations from public collections. On June 30 in Stebno, Minister Dostálová stated that the grant would be reduced by insurance payments made by insurers and that uninsured citizens, given the exceptional nature of the meteorological event, would receive the full amount of damages. Finance Minister Alena Schillerová explained the reduction of grants by insurance as the impossibility of double compensation for damages, later announcing the same level of support for everyone, only for the government to approve grant conditions the next day with deductions for donations and insurance. The reduction by donations and insurance payments was criticized by the public and the opposition. On July 7, Minister Dostálová proposed to the government to exclude donations from deductions but not insurance payments; the government excluded donations from deductions and decided to deduct 70% of insurance payments from the grant. Criticism was also directed at the provision of grants only for completed and approved buildings, prompting the government to change the conditions of the Živel grant program on July 19, allowing funds to be drawn for unfinished buildings. The state's approach was also criticized for offering interest-free loans to entrepreneurs while offering interest-bearing loans to citizens. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs prepared the Tornado program, intended for approximately 200 companies and employees affected by the downburst and tornado, with a volume of up to 280 million CZK per month. It was a variation of the Antivirus program, which was part of state support during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic. In cases where obstacles arose on the part of the employer or employee due to the disaster, the employer could receive 100% of the actual wage costs incurred. Entrepreneurs and companies in affected municipalities were given the option to defer social insurance payments for June to November, but they must pay the insurance in 2021. Similarly, the Ministry of Finance waived penalties for affected business entities. The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) prepared an investment program called Properties within the Operational Program Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness, amounting to 500 million CZK. Small and medium-sized entrepreneurs can apply for a grant of up to 35 million CZK for the restoration or expansion of operations. MPO is preparing another investment title for large companies and entrepreneurs in tourism. The Ministry for Regional Development prepared a program for the restoration of municipal and regional property damaged by the June storms, allocating 420 million CZK, with municipalities able to receive grants of up to 90%, exceptionally up to 100%, and regions up to 50%. On July 1, the government approved the deployment of up to 1,000 soldiers with necessary equipment to deal with damages upon the request of the region or the Integrated Rescue System."

Stebno was only added later to some programs aimed at supporting South Moravian regions affected by the tornado, and some programs were prepared exclusively for the South Moravian region. An example is the Ministry of Industry and Trade's (MPO) Tornado Assistance program with a subsidy of 200 million CZK, from which entrepreneurs could receive a subsidy of up to 1 million CZK for the restoration or acquisition of new property replacing destroyed assets or obtain support of 50,000 CZK for damage cleanup. Similarly, the Czech-Moravian Guarantee and Development Bank provided interest-free loans of up to 45 million CZK from the Expansion – Loans program only to entrepreneurs affected in South Moravia."

The day after the storm, the city of Kryry intended to pay for all necessary work from the municipal budget and did not announce a public collection. The city leadership was subsequently criticized for not having a known account for sending money for aid or for not informing the affected about a discounted offer for building materials. Financial resources could be sent to the city of Kryry's account from the end of June, and the city plans to use them for repairing public places in Stebno. At the beginning of July, the city council of Kryry decided to donate 20,000 CZK to each damaged property number in Stebno, and by July 8, they had paid out 1.42 million CZK to the citizens of Stebno. The city announced a public collection from July 9 until the end of the year. At the end of August 2021, the city council of Kryry decided to allocate 21 million CZK collected through the public collection, with 30% (7 to 7.5 million CZK) to be used for direct aid to affected citizens. The remaining approximately 14 million CZK will be used for repairing damaged public infrastructure and greenery, waste disposal, repairing municipal equipment damaged during cleanup, and for associations and organizations. Funds will be distributed to residents based on the extent of the damage and against documented repair costs. Residents with permanent residence in Stebno will receive a 100% subsidy ranging from 30,000 to 200,000 CZK, while cottage and chalet owners will receive half the subsidy. Opposition councilors criticized the approved system of fund distribution and proposed a fairer one. If grants for the restoration of public property are obtained, it is possible that citizens with damages exceeding one million CZK could receive additional aid from the public collection. The governor of the Ústí nad Labem Region, Jan Schiller, visited on June 25 to assess the extent of the damage and discuss whether some families needed further assistance, promising aid to affected municipalities in the region amounting to 1 million CZK. The councilors of the Karlovy Vary Region decided on June 28 to donate half a million CZK to the affected municipalities of the Ústí nad Labem Region and to announce a public financial collection to help all significantly affected municipalities. The Ústí nad Labem Region provided 50 dehumidifiers from the central humanitarian aid warehouse to people in the affected municipalities on July 3. The councilors of the Ústí nad Labem Region decided on July 12 to donate 2 million CZK to the city of Kryry and 200,000 CZK to the municipality of Blatno. On Wednesday, July 7, the councilors of the Plzeň Region decided to donate half a million CZK to the Ústí nad Labem Region to help Stebno, Blatno, and Petrohrad, while the councilors of the Liberec Region decided on the same day to donate half a million CZK to Stebno. The city of Louny donated just under 19,000 CZK each to the city of Kryry, the Stebno 2020 Beautification Association, the Lubenec parish, and the municipality of Blatno; the donated amount corresponds to the city's population. The city of Ústí nad Labem donated 1.5 million CZK jointly to Moravian municipalities and Stebno, and the city of Roudnice nad Labem similarly distributed one million CZK. The city of Kladno donated 1 million CZK to Stebno, Litoměřice half a million CZK, the city of Teplice 400,000 CZK, the city of Aš and the town of Nepomyšl each 300,000 CZK, the cities of Lovosice, Tanvald, and Bílina each 250,000 CZK, the Plzeň 3 municipal district 200,000 CZK, and Frýdlant 150,000 CZK. The voluntary association of municipalities Chomutovsko donated 170,000 CZK to Stebno. The city of Postoloprty donated 220,000 CZK to Stebno and 30,000 CZK to Blatno, while the city of Česká Lípa similarly donated 150,000 CZK to Stebno and 50,000 CZK to Blatno. The city of Frýdek-Místek donated 20,000 CZK to both, and the Prague 7 municipal district donated 10,000 CZK to both. The city of Příbram and the Prague 6 municipal district each donated 100,000 CZK, while smaller amounts were donated to Stebno by, for example, Mladá Boleslav, Děčín, Žatec, Lysá nad Labem, Žižice, Hostomice, Veltrusy, Týnec nad Sázavou, Zbečno, and the Prague 9, Prague 11, Prague 14, and Prague 17 municipal districts. The city of Krupka provided material aid to Stebno worth 150,000 CZK.

On June 30, the organization concluded 22 donation agreements with the affected individuals, amounting to a total of 3.1 million Czech crowns. Since many of the affected are seniors for whom organizing repairs is difficult, People in Need hired a local coordinator, Eliška Ratiborská, who will work together with the Beautification Association STEBNO 2020 to assist with restoration until the end of the year. At the same time, the organization will provide material assistance in the form of building materials, for example, securing 4 truckloads of roofing materials on June 30, and is collecting financial resources for the Louny region in the SOS Morava account, from which at least 5 million crowns will go to the area. People in Need has become the main coordinator for ensuring financial and material assistance. The Ústí-based Volunteer Center ensured the coordination of volunteers offering help to municipalities. Branches of the Czech Red Cross (ČČK) organized material collections, for example, the branch in Semily collected 6 tons of items such as generators, cookers, and tools for Stebno and damaged municipalities in Moravia, while the branch in Jablonec nad Nisou later collected only requested items. The local group ČČK Unhošť, in cooperation with the Regional Association ČČK Kladno, collected and purchased tools, building materials, and work equipment. At the beginning of July, ČČK released 2 million crowns for building materials for Stebno. The Diocesan Charity of Plzeň collected money to help the residents of Stebno, raising nearly half a million crowns by mid-July, and by early August, the amount exceeded 680,000 crowns. The charity also sent its Field Crisis Service team to Stebno, offering people crisis psychological support and immediate humanitarian aid. The Diocesan Charity distributed 631,000 crowns among eight families and established a crisis assistance fund for future extraordinary events with the remaining funds. Contributions for the restoration of the Church of St. John the Baptist could be made through the Dominanty Endowment Fund. The Czech Radio Endowment Fund launched the \"Help Moravia with Us\" collection, and residents of affected municipalities, including Stebno, could apply for financial support from this collection of up to 100,000 crowns starting June 27."

The Podbořansko municipal association announced a public financial collection to help the town of Kryry and the villages of Blatno and Petrohrad. The Ústí Community Foundation also launched a collection, intending to distribute the funds among affected citizens and the municipalities themselves, raising over 366,000 crowns by August 8. The Žluticko association collected 317,000 crowns for Stebno through a campaign on the znesnáze21.cz platform. Another collection for the affected villages is ongoing on the Donio platform. In the first days after the disaster, the Central Most department store organized material aid focused on cleaning supplies and toiletries, later placing a box for financial donations, which was subsequently stolen. Interestingly, the material collection \"Help for Moravia,\" held in Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, ended up in Stebno after being rejected in southern Moravia. At a cultural event held on June 26, residents and visitors of the Krušnohorská village of Blatno raised 46,000 crowns to help the affected Blatno. Similarly, money for Stebno and Blatno was collected at a football match between FK Baník Most-Souš and the German Chemnitzer. The music group BengaBand organized a benefit concert on Saturday, July 10, in Mutěnín in the Domažlice region, raising 37,000 crowns, to which a local enthusiasts' association added over 7,000 crowns, and the municipality of Mutěnín contributed 50,000 crowns; a total of 94,000 crowns was sent to support the village of Stebno. On August 14, a benefit cultural event was held in Stebno to support and restore the village, with proceeds of nearly 110,000 crowns handed over to the town of Kryry. The event was not well-received by some residents of Stebno, as they did not consider a celebration in front of the ruins of still-unrepaired houses appropriate and did not want the damaged houses to be displayed. The Rotary Club Most collected 55,000 crowns for Stebno, including at a golf tournament in Bítozeves. The BigMat Foundation organized a benefit \"Evening for Stebno\" on August 7, 2021, in Václav Havel Park in Litoměřice to help the Bali family."

The extent of the damage was likely influenced by the farm's location on the very edge of the village near the fields. His mother, Božena Přibíková, experienced the storm in Stebno, enduring shattered windows, torrents of water, and hail. The Přibík family received a donation from Vladimír Wűrtherle, a disabled man from Tymákov, who gave them 50,000 crowns he had saved for an electric leg prosthesis. The Přibíks will use the donation to purchase materials to repair the house. Josef Holák, the owner of a sheltered workshop in Jirkov, along with friends, provided the Přibík family with materials for roof repairs and window replacements worth approximately 300,000 crowns."

Petráň's family with cleanup,[236] and roof repairs are expected to follow.[49] Jaroslav Petráň believes that the insurance company will cover the damages to the insured property,[3] and he also inquired about a state grant from the Živel program.[125] Both brothers work as firefighters at Karlovy Vary airport, which means lower pay, and they cannot afford unexpected expenses.[54] A fundraiser for the Petráň families was launched on the Donio platform, raising over 30,000 crowns by the end of August.[237]"

When they were returning home, the storm caught them in their car in the yard of the house. They stayed in the car, which was hit by the roof of a wooden gazebo, an electric pole, and a tree. They escaped uninjured, with Mrs. Bali in her ninth month of pregnancy. The storm damaged the roof, and subsequently, water destroyed the floors, ceilings, and plaster, flooding the basement. It rained for the next two days, and the tarp covering the damaged roof could not prevent further water seepage into the house. The salvaged belongings were placed in an emergency shelter in the yard, and they began a second reconstruction. After removing the destroyed interior elements and insulation, only the outer walls and the bathroom remained of the house, with a blue tarp covering it instead of a roof. After clearing the debris and damaged parts, it was time to gather materials so that craftsmen could repair the roof. On July 8, their son Mathias, nicknamed Tornado, was born, and he stayed with his mother in Podbořany for several weeks because the house restoration was still ongoing. Michal Bali aimed to complete the house repairs in August and praised the speed at which the restoration progressed thanks to the help of friends and strangers. A financial collection for the Bali family was organized by the Litoměřice branch of the construction company BigMat, and another was organized on the darujme.cz platform by the handball club Lovci Lovosice."

Ratiborský of his roof, including skylights, and the photovoltaic panels ended up in a field. After the storm, his living room was covered with a layer of hail, and the ceilings, insulation, walls, and floors were soaked. The kitchen unit, including appliances, and the doors with their frames were damaged. The downburst also destroyed the garden, including trees. After clearing out, the house was in a rough construction phase. He was assisted in clearing the damage and removing the damaged equipment by mining rescuers from the Mining Rescue Station in Kladno–Libušín and many others.

A day later, the first official tropical temperature was recorded as the mercury in De Bilt rose to 30.8 °C. Wind from the west brought humid air from the North Sea to the Netherlands. During the night of June 17 to 18, more humid air arrived from France. By the morning of June 18, some showers had already occurred, with rainfall amounts between 10 and 20 mm. The forecast for the rest of the day was that wind at higher altitudes would increase. Due to a low-pressure area approaching from the south, vertical wind shear with wind speeds up to 40 kts was also expected. CAPE values were predicted to rise to between 2,000 and 2,500 J/kg. During the day, the first regional heatwave occurred as temperatures above 25.0 °C were recorded for five consecutive days in various locations. Due to significant temperature differences between the air layers, the warm air near the ground could rise quickly. Because of this and the high humidity, there was significant cloud formation, and hailstones could develop at higher altitudes. According to meteorologist Michiel Severin from Weerplaza, all the ingredients for extreme showers were present due to the \"[tropical heat], very humid air, great instability, a wind that shifts with altitude, and also a weak low-pressure area.\" Marco Verhoef described the situation as \"explosive.\" The KNMI considered the possibility of a supercell forming, and a local tornado was not ruled out. From midnight, a yellow code warning was issued, which was upgraded to an orange code warning for much of the country by the evening of June 18."

It also became tropically warm in Arcen, Eindhoven, and Ell. Around 2:00 PM, the first intense thunderstorm developed near Bruges, moving towards the North Sea. Forty-five minutes later, the first storm hit the Netherlands, in the western part of Zeeland. In several places in North Brabant, tropical temperatures were also recorded. In the north, it remained cooler, with temperatures between 21 to 25°C and below 20°C on the Wadden Islands. Around 3:30 PM, more thunderstorms occurred near Eindhoven, west of Zeeland, and in western Belgium. Just after 4:00 PM, more thunderstorms developed near Rotterdam, The Hague, the Rivierengebied, and the southern part of the province of Utrecht. At 5:04 PM, code orange was issued for North and South Holland. The thunderstorms increased in number and intensity. At 5:27 PM, the code orange was extended to all provinces except Zeeland, North Brabant, and Limburg. About an hour later, a severe thunderstorm developed near Amersfoort with hailstones about ~3 cm in size. At 6:05 PM, storm damage was reported in Leersum. Around 5:30 PM, a gantry crane fell in Tiel, injuring one person.[19] At 6:56 PM, the code orange was downgraded. The three southern provinces received code green, and South Holland, Utrecht, and Gelderland received code yellow. Fallen trees caused a 9 km traffic jam on the A1 from Amersfoort to Apeldoorn near Hoenderloo. In the south, a few thunderstorms still occurred, but in the north and northwest, the storms remained more intense as the severe weather moved northward. In Bergen in North Holland, 114 mm of rainfall was recorded. Shortly before 8:00 PM, a downburst caused damage in the municipality of Oldebroek, where four high-voltage pylons were blown over. In the Drenthe town of Hollandscheveld, large hailstones fell. By 9:00 PM, the thunderstorms moved northeastward. Only the provinces of Friesland, Groningen, Drenthe, and Overijssel still had code orange. The damage in Leersum was so severe that the village was closed off, and emergency services escalated to GRIP 2. At 9:58 PM, only Groningen still had code orange."

On July 1, nearly two weeks after the storm, the damage in Leersum was estimated at €7.3 million. At least six houses were declared uninhabitable. Nine people were injured in Leersum. In Tiel, a total of two people were injured. In addition to the person injured by the collapsed gantry crane, a second person was injured when a roof of an apartment building blew off. Twenty homes had to be evacuated. The total damage across the Netherlands was estimated at around €37 million. For comparison, that is about 13% of the amount insurers have paid out annually since 2007 for damage to cars and buildings caused by weather. The damage mainly involved leaks caused by fallen trees landing on houses, clogged sewers, and blown-off roofs. The forests near Leersum were heavily affected by the downburst. In the Lombok Forest, thousands of trees were blown down, and entire plots of production forest were lost. An area of 750 hectares was temporarily closed to the public for safety reasons. On July 2, 350 hectares were reopened. In 2023, the destruction was found to have positive effects on biodiversity. Between the fallen Scots pines, deciduous trees and other vegetation spontaneously appeared. Because human accessibility was greatly reduced, more animals such as deer and badgers appeared. Enthusiasts of dead wood, such as black woodpeckers, lizards, and various insects, also increased. Utrechts Landschap decided to improve accessibility again and created a special \"storm path.\" In the Breeveen area, about 35 hectares were designated as a \"storm reserve,\" where all dead wood remains in place. In the municipality of Oldebroek, four high-voltage pylons fell due to a downburst. According to transmission system operator TenneT, such a calamity caused by gusts of wind last occurred in 2008. The high-voltage pylons each weighed 16 tons, and the construction was designed to withstand wind gusts of up to 180 km/h. During the incident, the cables landed on a farm. No injuries were reported. Temporary replacement pylons were installed in the fall. Due to the coronavirus crisis, TenneT faced a material shortage, and the definitive pylons were only installed a year later. In 2022, the province of Utrecht allocated €1.5 million to restore tree planting along roads within built-up areas and in nature reserves around Leersum, Valkenheide, and Maarsbergen. The national government also provided financial support."

The event originated from an Atlantic disturbance which, in the context of a severe wave of bad weather over Italy (also affecting the neighboring regions of Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia), brought extremely strong winds and persistent rains to the region. The event is erroneously referred to as a \"storm\" (grade 10 on the Beaufort scale), but the winds reached \"hurricane\" speeds (grade 12), winds that typically originate only over tropical or subtropical waters of the planet. The extremely strong warm sirocco wind, blowing between 100 and 200 km/h for several hours, caused the fall of millions of trees, resulting in the destruction of tens of thousands of hectares of alpine conifer forests, thus constituting a true natural disaster: the crisis unit activated by the Veneto Region classified the event as worse than the Venice flood of November 4, 1966 (which nonetheless affected the entire region), the Veneto flood of 2010, and other previous meteorological events recorded in the area."

The most affected areas were Agordino, Cadore, Feltrino, Comelico, Carnia, Val di Fassa, and Val di Fiemme. The heavy and abundant rains caused the Piave and Brenta rivers to overflow, while to prevent the Adige River from overflowing, the Adige-Garda tunnel was opened. In the mountainous environment, several streams overflowed, and there were numerous landslides. The Alleghe Lake also overflowed."

                "content": "The sirocco wind reached gusts of 192.24 km/h in Veneto on October 29 (instantaneous value reported at 10 m above ground) recorded by the Arpa station on Mount Cesen and 166.68 km/h by the homologous station on Mount Verena, while in Carnia gusts reached 200 km/h and 170 km/h respectively at the Osmer stations of Cima Rest and Col Gallina (Polcenigo). In Trentino, at Passo Rolle, the wind reached 217.3 km/h. The extremely strong gusts, comparable according to mountaineer Reinhold Messner to winds recorded on Mount Everest (with very intense average winds often exceeding the highest values of the Beaufort scale, between \"violent storm\" and \"hurricane\"), caused the destruction of numerous trees and, in several cases, the felling of entire forests. The areas most affected by the wind were the Altopiano dei Sette Comuni (especially Val d'Assa and Piana di Marcesina), Val Visdende, Agordino (Alleghe, Canale d'Agordo with Valle di Gares, Colle Santa Lucia, Falcade with Valle del Biois, Rocca Pietore, and the entire Valle di San Lucano in Taibon Agordino), the area surrounding Lake Carezza, the Valli di Fassa and Fiemme (particularly Paneveggio), and the Altopiano di Piné, as well as various areas of the Lagorai mountain range. Part of the Lombardy region (especially Valcamonica) was also affected by the events, with the most impacted areas being Passo Crocedomini in the municipality of Bienno and the municipalities of Paspardo and Cimbergo, as well as several areas in the municipalities of Sonico and Ponte di Legno. In particular, due to the uprooting of numerous trees along power lines and the collapse of pylons, there were severe disruptions to the electricity distribution across the mountainous areas of Triveneto. By October 30, Terna, Enel, and SET Distribuzione had managed with difficulty to restore power to 200,000 users in Veneto and Friuli, but by October 31, there were still 10,000 users without electricity in Carnia, 3,000 in eastern Trentino (Val di Fiemme and Val di Fassa), and 8,600 in the Vicenza area (particularly on the Altopiano dei Sette Comuni)."

In Lombardy, estimates are around 40 million euros in damages. Regarding forests, due to the wind, it is estimated that 14 million trees were felled (a figure never recorded in recent times in Italy) over an area of 41,000 hectares. In Lombardy, the damaged forest areas were identified by the Region through photo interpretation of images from the European Union's Sentinel satellite and are viewable on the Geoportal of Lombardy."

The strongest gusts in Denmark were measured at Hanstholm at 38.1 m/s, where the strongest average wind speed was also recorded at 27.3 m/s. This means that Otto in Denmark was classified as a storm on the Beaufort wind scale. The Øresund Bridge was closed for several hours due to the storm.

In some places, the situation was serious, as Slovenia had recently experienced extensive August floods. Due to the consequences of the October storm, slightly fewer than 150 people were evacuated. The November storm had greater impacts primarily in Podravska, with rivers rising across much of the country, the sea overflowing its banks, and 15 people being evacuated."

For Friday, a rapid rise in rivers and torrential streams was forecast in the early morning hours. Residents of the mentioned areas were urged to take self-protective measures and move their vehicles and valuable items. They also warned of an increased likelihood of landslides. On Friday, October 27, 2023, heavy rainfall swept across the country in the early morning hours. A weather cyclone that formed overnight over northern Italy moved eastward across the northern Adriatic and Slovenia during the morning. On the coast, the sea overflowed its banks, triggering sirens in Koper, Izola, Piran, and Portorož. During the day, 158 liters of rain per square meter fell in the Logar Valley area. In Bovec, 22 liters of rain per square meter fell in just half an hour, causing the Bača River to flood its surroundings. The rainfall was accompanied by strong winds. The Savinja River rose significantly, and in the Upper Savinja Valley area, sirens were activated as a precaution to alert people to floods and landslides. Torrential streams flooded the road from Ljubno to Gornji Grad, but it was soon passable again. The Dreta and Ljubnica rivers also caused problems. In Kamnik, the Veliki Dam on the Kamniška Bistrica River became clogged, causing the river to rise and overflow in certain areas. According to the N1 media outlet, residents were fearful of a repeat of the August flood scenario, but no other major inconveniences were reported. In the afternoon, the weather calmed down, most of the day's rainfall had already occurred, and only short showers were still possible."

A red hydrological warning was also issued for the northern and eastern parts of the country, with water levels expected to rise in all rivers across Slovenia. Meteorologists estimated the total rainfall in 24 hours in northwest Slovenia to be between 120 and 240 liters per square meter. Due to the additional soil saturation, they also warned of an increased risk of landslides. Civil Protection Commander Srečko Šestan signed an order to raise the readiness of the relevant services across Slovenia, except for Prekmurje. In the municipality of Tolmin, the road between Bača pri Modreju and Petrovo Brdo was preventively closed on Thursday afternoon due to the risk of landslides. Accommodation capacities were also being prepared for potential evacuees. In Braslovče, the head of the Flood Recovery Service, Boštjan Šefic, met with residents, presenting them with flood risks and measures, with initial estimates suggesting around 150 people might need to be relocated. Civil protection representatives also visited the field in several other municipalities, such as Kamnik, Škofja Loka, Tržič, Prevalje, and Izola, to ensure preparedness. The port of Koper was closed to traffic due to strong winds. On the night of Friday, November 3, the strongest wind gusts reached speeds of 185 km/h at Kredarica. In Bovec, 222 liters of rain per square meter fell within 24 hours. Meteorologists confirmed in the early morning hours that conditions were calming down, and since the worst-case scenario did not materialize, the ARSO agency downgraded the meteorological warning. Rivers across Slovenia flooded, including the upper Sava, the Sava Bohinjka, which caused disruptions in Bohinj and its surroundings, and rivers in the upper Soča Valley. In Tolmin, some roads were closed, and the previous evening, 28 residents of Baška Grapa decided to temporarily relocate due to endangered houses. The Drava River rose more intensely and flooded on a larger scale. In the morning, sirens were sounded in Dravograd and Vuzenica to warn residents about self-protection, and later in several other municipalities in the Drava region. The flow of the Drava River was among the highest in recent years, flooding, among other places, a police station. Due to the danger, 15 people from nine buildings were evacuated along Ribiška Pot. In Kranj, the rising Sava River reached and covered a sewage pipe under the Planika Bridge. If the rising water were to damage the pipe, it would pose a threat to 25,000 residents of Kranj connected to the sewage system, as well as other parts of Slovenia. The Municipality of Kranj has therefore begun preparations to obtain construction documentation for building a new bridge."

Deep convection was erupting around the low-level circulation center. An upper-level storm and a tropical upper tropospheric trough were providing outflow. Over the next few days, the disturbance gradually developed before being declared dissipated early on July 28 as the low-level circulation center became poorly defined and higher vertical wind shear affected the system. However, the disturbance was regenerated early on July 30 while located about 630 km (390 miles) away, with the low-level circulation center of the disturbance elongated and showing signs of multiple circulation centers. Later that day, PAGASA reported that the disturbance had developed into a tropical depression and assigned it the local name Jolina. Jolina then further intensified early the next day and was reported to have become a tropical storm by PAGASA, with the JMA designating it as a depression later that day. Early on August 1, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as deep convection increased and began consolidating around a circulation center. However, later that morning, Jolina made landfall near Casiguran, in the province of Aurora in the Philippines, before emerging into the South China Sea later that day. Early the next day, the JTWC reissued their TCFA while PAGASA issued their final warning on Jolina as it exited their area of responsibility heading towards a landfall in China. Subsequently, the JTWC designated the depression as 08W that day as infrared imagery showed deep convection being drawn into the low-level circulation center. On August 3, the JMA reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a tropical storm and assigned the name Goni to the storm. At 1700 UTC on August 4, Goni made its second landfall in Macau. Early the next day, the JTWC issued their final warning on Goni. On August 7, the JTWC noted that the remnants of Goni had re-entered the Gulf of Tonkin and had a low chance of regeneration. Later that day, the JTWC reissued advisories on the system, upgrading it to a tropical storm near Hainan Island."

The hottest day was Saturday, July 13, when the air in the south and center of the country warmed above 35°C (a red danger level was announced, with expected heat of +35—37°C). A record high of +37.9°C since 1959 was recorded at the meteorological station in Zhitkovichi. In Minsk, the 1936 record was broken with +35.2°C. During this time, meteorologists began warning about the likelihood of powerful thunderstorms. Belhydromet issued a warning about approaching storm winds. Meteorologist Dmitry Rabov stated that in the coming decades, the climate will change, noting that waves of intense heat with hurricanes and storms will become more frequent in summer. A similar opinion was expressed by Vladimir Loginov, an academician of the National Academy of Sciences. The specialist said that in recent years, the climate in the country has increasingly resembled a tropical one, characterized by hurricanes and typhoons."

The Luninyets and Pinsk districts were the most affected. On the same day, heavy rains with squally winds swept through the Gomel region. The hurricane felled a large number of trees, many of which fell on power lines, leading to widespread outages. Access to power grids was hindered by the large number of fallen trees and branches. The most difficult situation was in the Mozyr, Kalinkovichi, Rechitsa, and Gomel districts. Only a few stores equipped with their own generators were operational in the cities. Water supply and communication were also completely absent. Wind gusts reached 29 meters per second. The situation was worsened by heat exceeding +30°C. Technological disruptions in power grids were recorded over a stretch of more than 12.5 thousand km, leaving 1,175 settlements in the Gomel region without electricity. Six people, including two children, died from fallen trees and roof elements. About 700 road signs were blown away by the wind. In the Mogilev region, about 800 buildings were affected, more than 600 settlements were left without power, 5.5 thousand hectares of forest were destroyed, and 384 trees were reported to have fallen. In the Mogilev district, a five-year-old girl died from a fallen tree. Power outages were observed in the Klichev, Krasnopolye, Krichev, Bobruisk, Mogilev, Kostyukovichi, Osipovichi, and Slavgorod districts. Additionally, three fires occurred due to lightning strikes (barns in the Mogilev and Slavgorod districts, and a residential house in the Chausy district). In the Vitebsk region, the disaster most affected the Polotsk and Ushachi districts. Twenty residential houses were damaged, and 53 cases of fallen trees were recorded. In one case, a resident of Ushachi was injured. Power lines were damaged in the Glubokoye, Dokshitsy, Miory, Polotsk, Ushachi, and Verkhnyadzvinsk districts.

In total, about 1,500 people and 276 units of equipment were involved in the region, including 474 individuals with criminal records and 100 servicemen from the 6th Separate Special Police Brigade. Local residents took the initiative to help clear debris and fallen trees, assisting utility workers. Energy Minister Viktor Karankevich reported at a conference call that, as of July 19, electricity supply in the Gomel region was restored in terms of power delivery to all settlements, but in 170 of them, this was achieved through the use of diesel generator installations. According to preliminary data, it will take up to a month to fully restore the power grids. In some villages, the networks had to be rebuilt from scratch, as the storm had almost completely destroyed them. Electricity was finally restored on July 26 at 22:40, when the village of Lozki in the Kalinkovichi district, the last affected settlement, was disconnected from the mobile diesel generator and connected to the main grid."

It was characterized by intense winds and large hail, as well as widespread power outages in the capital city of São Paulo. According to the state Civil Defense, at least 98 municipalities in the state recorded strong winds during the event. In total, eight people died in different cities. Winds that day reached a peak of 107.6 km/h in the Interlagos region, in the southern zone of São Paulo, during the night, the highest value ever recorded in the city since measurements began in 1995. The combination of strong winds and heavy rains caused destruction and a blackout in much of the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (RMSP), affecting 2.1 million customers. By October 14, the total damage had already reached R$ 1.65 billion solely in relation to the blackout. In Presidente Prudente, there was large hail on the same day, during the afternoon. According to MetSul Meteorologia, the phenomenon that hit Greater São Paulo had characteristics of a bow echo. The company estimated that winds in the southern zone of the capital could have reached 120 km/h. A similar event was identified by the IPMet/UNESP radar in the Piracicaba Metropolitan Region (RMP) at 7 p.m."

The first hurricane in Finnish measurement history was observed in Finnish sea areas when a 10-minute average wind speed of 33.5 m/s was recorded at Rauma's Kylmäpihlaja.[1] The strongest gust on land, 26.1 m/s, was measured at Pori railway station.[2] At its peak, over 40,000 customers were simultaneously without electricity.[3] The storm damage was relatively confined to a small area near the coast in Satakunta and Southwest Finland, but it was locally significant. The power grid was severely damaged in Eurajoki and parts of Rauma, where a total of about 900 customers were still without electricity three days after the storm.[4][5] Two power line pylons of the high-voltage transmission grid in Eurajoki also fell due to the wind's force.[6] Altogether, the Satakunta Rescue Department handled nearly 500 storm-related tasks.[7] In Southwest Finland, the corresponding number was over 250.[8] The intensity of the Lyly storm could not be accurately predicted. The storm was caused by a low-pressure system formed in a strong jet stream area and unusually warm seawater, which enabled a thick mixing layer of air and thus allowed winds strengthened by the jet stream to reach the ground.[9]"

In a generally unfavorable atmospheric environment, it initially lacked organization and developed slowly. After several days of slow development, it intensified into a tropical depression within the monsoon trough on August 6. The tropical depression gradually strengthened in a favorable environment, becoming a tropical storm on August 8 and was named Khanun by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Khanun turned northward under the influence of the southerly flow brought by the subtropical ridge to the east. At this time, Khanun was still within the monsoon trough, with vigorous convection and good spiral structure, but concentrated in the eastern part, with the low-level circulation center partially exposed. Khanun intensified into a severe tropical storm at noon on August 9, with its structure further consolidating in the afternoon as the low-level circulation center developed under the convection and began forming an eye. Khanun reached its peak intensity on August 10, with maximum sustained winds near its center reaching 95 km/h and maximum gusts of 130 km/h. \n\nOn the evening of August 10, Khanun moved to the northwest of the subtropical ridge, turning northeast, passing about 10 km west of Jeju Island [4], and crossing southern South Korea the next morning. At this time, Khanun began to weaken due to strong vertical wind shear and the terrain of South Korea, with convection starting to dissipate and shift eastward, exposing the low-level circulation center. Khanun made landfall in Busan at noon, passing about 15 km northwest of the city [5]. Later that afternoon, Khanun entered the Sea of Japan. Affected by low sea surface temperatures and strong vertical wind shear, Khanun weakened into a tropical storm early on August 12 and crossed Japan that afternoon, eventually transitioning into an extratropical cyclone early the next day [6]."

                "content": "The Hong Kong Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 10:55 pm on July 14, when Kompasu was located about 720 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. Due to the subsiding air currents of Kompasu, the weather was dry and very hot from July 14 to 15. As Kompasu approached, the Observatory issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 5:15 am on July 16, when Kompasu was about 170 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. At 5:20 am, the Observatory stated that it would consider issuing the Gale or Storm Signal No. 8 between the morning and noon. At 7:55 am, the Observatory further stated that Kompasu would come very close to Hong Kong, making the issuance of Signal No. 8 highly likely, and Kompasu's spiral rainbands began bringing showers to Hong Kong. Winds at Waglan Island gradually strengthened to gale force in the morning, and the Observatory issued a \"Special Announcement on Tropical Cyclone\" at 9:45 am, announcing that Signal No. 8 was expected to be issued by 11:45 am or earlier, when Kompasu was about 80 kilometers southeast of the Observatory. At 11:45 am, the Observatory issued the Northeast Gale or Storm Signal No. 8, when Kompasu was about 60 kilometers southeast of the Observatory, and subsequently changed to the Northwest Gale or Storm Signal No. 8 at 2:45 pm. Around 3:00 pm on July 16, Kompasu made landfall in Sai Kung. At the same time, it was closest to the Observatory headquarters, located about 25 kilometers east of the headquarters. After landfall, Kompasu moved across the northeastern New Territories. The Observatory changed to the Southwest Gale or Storm Signal No. 8 at 4:45 pm, when Kompasu was about 30 kilometers north of the Observatory. As Kompasu began to move away from Hong Kong and weakened into a tropical depression, winds within the territory gradually subsided, and the Observatory changed to the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 7:20 pm on July 16, when Kompasu was about 55 kilometers north of the Observatory. Subsequently, all tropical cyclone warning signals were canceled at 8:20 pm.\n\nDuring Kompasu's closest approach to Hong Kong on the afternoon of July 16, strong winds were generally experienced within the territory, with gales over offshore waters and on high ground. The highest hourly mean wind speed recorded at Tap Mun was 47 kilometers per hour, with the highest gust reaching 79 kilometers per hour. Waglan Island recorded the highest hourly mean wind speed of 88 kilometers per hour, with the highest gust reaching 106 kilometers per hour. The minimum instantaneous sea-level pressures recorded at the Observatory headquarters, Waglan Island, and Ta Kwu Ling were 1,000.5 hPa, 995.7 hPa, and 1,001.0 hPa, respectively. Kompasu's rainbands and remnants brought heavy squally showers to Hong Kong on the afternoon of July 16 and the following day. The Observatory issued the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal twice, from 5:00 pm to 6:50 pm on July 16 and from 2:20 am to 3:30 am on July 17. The Observatory headquarters recorded over 120 millimeters of rainfall in total.\n\nAdditionally, during Kompasu's impact on Hong Kong, 12 people were injured, including two who were struck by falling objects in Tsuen Wan and North Point. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department received 19 emergency assistance requests for trees blown down by strong winds, blocking roads or posing dangers, with 4 cases on Hong Kong Island, 6 in Kowloon, and 9 in the New Territories. There was one minor flooding incident on Lockhart Road in Wan Chai, and no reports of landslides across the territory. The Home Affairs Department opened 25 temporary shelters, accommodating a total of 276 residents. Regarding maritime transport, most ferry services within the harbor and to outlying islands were suspended at one point. For land transport, the MTR, East Rail, West Rail, and Light Rail maintained limited services (the railway company was then known as KCR, now MTR), and public transport services gradually returned to normal in the evening.\n\nThe Observatory issued a \"Special Announcement on Tropical Cyclone\" at 9:45 am on July 16 and issued Signal No. 8 at 11:45 am. Many citizens only learned about the issuance of Signal No. 8 while commuting to work or after arriving at their workplaces (some had already been working for one or two hours), prompting them to rush home. Some citizens questioned why the Observatory could not issue Signal No. 8 earlier, before the start of work and school hours. Since Kompasu was only a tropical storm with a small circulation structure, its gale radius was only about 60 kilometers, and its strong wind radius was only about 150 kilometers. Therefore, slight changes in its path could significantly affect the wind conditions in Hong Kong. If Kompasu's path had shifted, making landfall east of Hong Kong along the eastern Guangdong coast instead of in Hong Kong, it might not have been necessary to issue Signal No. 8. As a result, the Observatory could only state that the chance of issuing Signal No. 8 was high without specifying the exact time. At 9:00 am on July 16, when Kompasu was about 100 kilometers east-southeast of the Observatory headquarters, winds in Hong Kong only reached moderate to fresh levels (not meeting the lower limit of Signal No. 3). Therefore, the earliest the Observatory could issue a Signal No. 8 alert was at 9:45 am. During the period when Signal No. 8 was in effect, only offshore waters and high ground experienced gale-force winds. After Kompasu weakened into a tropical depression, Signal No. 3 was issued at 7:20 pm on the same day."

By 1 p.m., Kompasu was centered 100 kilometers east of Macau, moving northwest at a speed of about 20 kilometers per hour, gradually approaching Macau. The wind intensified, and the Meteorological Bureau announced that there was a high chance of hoisting Typhoon Signal No. 8 based on the typhoon's trajectory. While residents were generally expecting Kompasu to bring Typhoon Signal No. 8 to Macau, Kompasu, true to its name, abruptly changed its course by 90 degrees, heading directly toward Hong Kong. It made landfall at the High Island Reservoir in Sai Kung at 3 p.m. After changing its course, Kompasu's impact upon landfall posed no threat to Macau and moved inland into Guangdong. At 4 p.m. on the same day, Kompasu was closest to Macau, located about 95 kilometers northeast of the city. As Kompasu weakened and moved away, the Geophysical and Meteorological Bureau lowered all signals at 9 p.m. on July 16. Kompasu was the only tropical cyclone in 2004 to prompt the hoisting of tropical cyclone signals in Macau."

This was the first time since 1966 that two No. 8 signals were issued in July. On July 23, a tropical depression formed about 600 kilometers northeast of Manila, Philippines, moving west-northwest at a speed of 25 kilometers per hour. By midday, it entered the Luzon Strait and strengthened into a tropical storm that evening, named \"Utor.\" After entering the South China Sea, Utor shifted westward and strengthened into a severe tropical storm before noon on July 24, and further intensified into a typhoon within a few hours. Utor had a compact circulation with an eye diameter of about 60 kilometers. \n\nOn July 25, Utor moved west-northwest, approaching the western coast of Guangdong. Early on July 26, Utor weakened into a severe tropical storm and made landfall near Zhanjiang around 5 a.m. It further weakened into a tropical storm in the afternoon and moved inland, eventually dissipating into a low-pressure area that evening.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Observatory issued the No. 1 Standby Signal at 9:50 p.m. on July 23, when Utor was about 720 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. On July 24, as Utor continued to approach, its outer rainbands brought heavy showers and thunderstorms to Hong Kong in the afternoon, prompting the Observatory to issue the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 3:50 p.m. That evening, local winds strengthened significantly, with offshore areas experiencing strong winds. \n\nIn the hours before midnight, Utor's central wind speed rapidly increased from 120 kilometers per hour to 148 kilometers per hour, with a gale radius of about 160 kilometers. At 12:30 a.m. on July 25, the Observatory issued the No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal. By early morning, offshore and highland areas experienced gale-force winds, and the wind direction shifted from northeast to southeast. At 10:40 a.m., the Observatory issued the No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal, marking the last time the No. 8 signal was issued in this manner. Utor was closest to Hong Kong at noon, located about 180 kilometers south-southwest of the city. That day, gale-force winds were recorded in southern waters and highland areas of Hong Kong. Under Utor's influence, Cheung Chau recorded a maximum hourly mean wind speed of 68 kilometers per hour and a maximum gust of 115 kilometers per hour. Tai Mo Shan recorded a maximum hourly mean wind speed of 79 kilometers per hour and a maximum gust of 112 kilometers per hour. Torrential rain associated with Utor brought over 60 millimeters of rainfall to areas near Tsuen Wan, while most parts of Hong Kong recorded over 20 millimeters of rainfall. At 7:40 p.m. that evening, the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal was reissued.\n\nDuring Utor's impact, 10 people in Hong Kong were injured in various accidents, and there were 11 reports of fallen trees. On Lower Albert Road, a six-meter-tall tree was blown down, temporarily disrupting traffic. Two trees were also blown down on Observatory Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, crushing a car and the canopy of a hotel. There were two incidents of scaffolding collapse in Yau Tong and Kwai Chung. Additionally, over 160 people sought refuge in temporary shelters across the city. During the period when the No. 8 signal was in effect, about 30 flights were canceled, and over 150 flights were delayed."

                "content": "The Observatory hoisted the No. 8 signal on Wednesday, July 25, for a duration of 19 hours and 10 minutes, overlapping completely with mainstream working hours and the operation times of the commercial stock market. Since it was a regular working day (Monday to Saturday), most citizens received a day off. However, due to Typhoon Yutu's relatively small circulation (a gale radius of only 160 kilometers) and a path that was further south than expected (initially predicted to pass about 150 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong, but ultimately passing about 180 kilometers southwest-southwest of Hong Kong), Yutu only brought gales to the southern waters and highlands of Hong Kong. The impact on Hong Kong's urban areas was significantly less than the traditional impression of No. 8 signal wind strength. Urban weather stations such as Sai Kung, the airport, Tsing Yi, and the Kowloon Star Ferry Pier recorded maximum hourly average wind speeds of 49, 44, 43, and 41 kilometers per hour, respectively, which were still some distance from the gale threshold of 63 kilometers per hour. Moreover, Macau, which was closer to Yutu than Hong Kong, only hoisted the No. 3 signal. Authorities in other nearby cities (such as Shenzhen and Zhuhai) also did not issue similarly severe warnings to the public.\n\nAs a result, the business sector, led by then Liberal Party Chairman James Tien and then Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce CEO Eden Woon, criticized the Observatory for mistakenly hoisting the No. 8 signal under weather conditions that were not particularly severe. This caused most industries and the stock market to halt operations unnecessarily that day, reducing business profits and resulting in significant economic losses (estimated at HK$3 billion to HK$4 billion). Even then-Chief Secretary for Administration Donald Tsang (later Chief Executive) joined the criticism, stating that caution should be exercised in hoisting typhoon signals in the future. \n\nFollowing this incident, the Observatory, to avoid further criticism from the business sector, gradually adopted a more conservative approach to hoisting/issuing signals, basing decisions solely on wind strength within Victoria Harbour. However, the Observatory overlooked the fact that wind strength in the harbor was already shielded by buildings, resulting in lower wind readings compared to other exposed urban weather stations. For example, during Severe Tropical Storm Vongfong in 2002, the Observatory decided at 4 p.m. on August 19 that Vongfong had almost reached its closest point to Hong Kong, passing about 400 kilometers southwest of the city, and refused to issue the No. 3 strong wind signal as winds in the harbor had not reached strong wind levels. However, by around 8 p.m. that evening, Vongfong reached its closest point to Hong Kong, located about 390 kilometers west-southwest of the city, and made landfall near Zhanjiang. At 7 p.m., Kai Tak recorded an hourly average wind speed of 41 kilometers per hour, reaching strong wind levels, while the Kowloon Star Ferry Pier recorded an hourly average wind speed of 40 kilometers per hour at 1 a.m. on August 20, just shy of strong wind levels. Despite strong winds being recorded in the harbor, the Observatory did not mention this in its tropical cyclone warning, only stating that strong winds were affecting offshore and highland areas in the southwest of Hong Kong. The Observatory's increasingly conservative approach to hoisting/issuing signals indirectly contributed to the Prapiroon incident in 2006."

By 8 p.m. on the same day, it strengthened into a tropical storm while crossing the Balintang Channel (approximately at 20.1°N, 121.0°E), with a central pressure of 995 hPa and maximum wind speeds near the center of 65 kilometers per hour. It then steadily moved westward, and by 2 p.m. on July 24, it strengthened into a severe tropical storm in the South China Sea, 400 kilometers southeast of Macau (approximately at 20.5°N, 117.0°E), with a central pressure of 978 hPa and maximum wind speeds near the center of 112 kilometers per hour. Three hours later, it rapidly intensified into a typhoon near Dongsha, with a central pressure dropping to 960 hPa and maximum wind speeds near the center reaching 150 kilometers per hour. Between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. on July 25, Typhoon \"Yutu\" passed closest to Macau, about 160 kilometers south to southwest of the city. It then slightly shifted to a west-northwest direction, heading toward the Leizhou Peninsula. At 2 a.m. on July 26, it weakened into a severe tropical storm over the sea west of Macau (approximately at 21.3°N, 111.3°E). Two hours later, it made landfall along the southern coast of China between Yangjiang and Zhanjiang. \"Yutu\" turned northwestward inland in China and gradually dissipated, weakening into a tropical storm at 11 a.m. on July 26 and further into a tropical depression by 5 p.m. During its impact on Macau, there were minor damages such as fallen trees and signboards, as well as flooding in low-lying areas."

                "content": "The Royal Hong Kong Observatory hoisted the No. 1 Standby Signal at 10:45 PM on October 12, as Typhoon Elsie was centered about 740 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong, moving northwest at a speed of about 14 kilometers per hour towards the northeastern part of the South China Sea. After crossing the Bashi Channel, Elsie took a more westerly path. The Observatory replaced the Standby Signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 8:00 PM on October 13, when Elsie was centered about 350 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. Although Hong Kong was experiencing only light to moderate westerly winds at the time, Elsie was still expected to be intense and might pass close to Hong Kong, prompting the Observatory to warn residents to complete wind protection measures. At 4:30 AM on October 14, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 8 Northwest Gale or Storm Signal, as Elsie was centered about 190 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. At that time, Hong Kong experienced moderate to fresh northwesterly winds. As Elsie approached during the day, wind strength in Hong Kong increased rapidly, with gale-force winds recorded starting at 9:00 AM, when Elsie was centered about 130 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. Elsie remained well-organized and continued moving westward. At 11:00 AM, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 9 Gale or Storm Increasing Signal, indicating that wind strength in Hong Kong would significantly increase, as Elsie was centered about 70 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. By early afternoon, with clear signs that the eye of the storm would pass over the southern part of Hong Kong Island and its waters, the Observatory hoisted the No. 10 Hurricane Signal at 2:15 PM, with hurricane-force winds recorded offshore and in high-altitude areas. Elsie came closest to Hong Kong at 2:30 PM, centered about 50 kilometers south of the Observatory, moving westward at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour. During the afternoon, Tai Mo Shan recorded wind speeds of 130 kilometers per hour, with maximum gusts of 180 kilometers per hour, while Stanley recorded wind speeds of 141 kilometers per hour, with maximum gusts of 219 kilometers per hour. The instantaneous sea-level pressure at the Observatory headquarters dropped to a minimum of 996.2 hPa after 3:00 PM and quickly rose after the typhoon passed. \n\nElsie began to weaken after passing south of Hong Kong. As Elsie moved away, Hong Kong experienced easterly winds in the late afternoon, and wind strength began to moderate. At 5:05 PM, the Observatory replaced the No. 10 Hurricane Signal with the No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal, as Elsie was centered about 50 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. Later, at 8:10 PM, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal, as Elsie was centered about 70 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. On the evening of October 14, Elsie resumed a west-northwest path and further weakened into a tropical storm. After 10:00 PM, it crossed the coast of southern China about 110 kilometers west-southwest of Hong Kong. Wind strength in Hong Kong continued to weaken, and all signals were canceled at 2:00 AM on October 15, as the storm was centered about 150 kilometers west of Hong Kong. With a cool northeast monsoon beginning to affect the southern China coast, Elsie weakened into a tropical depression within the next hour and eventually dissipated inland about 190 kilometers west of Hong Kong by early morning.\n\nBefore Elsie's approach, Hong Kong experienced sunny and hot weather on October 12 and 13. On the morning of October 14, the weather turned cloudy with scattered showers, and rain became more frequent and accompanied by strong winds during the day. As Elsie moved closer to Hong Kong, heavy rain began in the early afternoon. The heaviest rain occurred between noon and 2:00 PM as Elsie passed south of Hong Kong. As Elsie moved away, rain weakened slightly later in the afternoon. On October 15, the weather remained overcast with light rain and occasional squally showers. Due to the influence of the easterly wind surge, the weather did not improve significantly the following day.\n\nUnder the influence of Elsie, five ocean-going vessels in Hong Kong dragged their anchors, and 46 people were injured on land due to debris and collapsed scaffolding, but there were no fatalities. Over 1,000 people sought refuge in storm shelters."

Shirley changed direction to move northwest towards Hong Kong in the early morning of August 21, and the Observatory replaced the No. 3 signal with the No. 7 signal at 7:00 am, when the storm was about 280 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. Shirley intensified into a typhoon in the afternoon. Due to its strengthening circulation, the Observatory replaced the No. 7 signal with the No. 9 signal at 2:40 pm, indicating stronger gale-force winds. When it was confirmed that the eye of the storm would pass over Hong Kong, the Observatory replaced the No. 9 signal with the No. 10 signal at 4:10 pm, when Shirley was about 80 kilometers southeast of the Observatory. Shirley's eye passed over the Observatory between 7:00 pm and 9:30 pm, during which Hong Kong experienced a sharp drop in wind speed, with light winds prevailing and calm conditions lasting for about two hours, though it remained cloudy with rain. The typhoon appeared to weaken slightly. The Observatory recorded the lowest instantaneous sea-level pressure of 968.7 hPa at 7:00 pm, the lowest on record for August. Shirley continued moving northwest at dusk, with most areas experiencing strong southerly winds starting at 10:00 pm. As Shirley weakened into a severe tropical storm at midnight, the Observatory replaced the No. 10 signal with the No. 6 signal at 11:45 pm, when the storm was about 90 kilometers northwest-north of the Observatory. As the winds gradually subsided, the Observatory replaced the No. 6 signal with the No. 3 signal at 5:25 am the next morning, when the storm was about 200 kilometers northwest of Hong Kong. Shirley significantly slowed down over Guangdong and finally weakened into a low-pressure area later in the morning. All signals were canceled at 12:10 pm. Shirley's passage over Hong Kong resulted in four injuries and caused a ship near the waters of Stonecutters Island to collide multiple times with another vessel."
