                "content": "On September 6, 1961, a tropical depression formed over the waters near Guam, moving northwest at a speed of 25 kilometers per hour. However, the guiding airflow became unclear, and from the 7th to the 9th, its speed was only 5 kilometers per hour. During this time, its development was very slow, and it was not until the afternoon of September 9 that it intensified into a mild typhoon (by today's standards, it would not yet be considered a mild typhoon). At this point, it was located about 850 kilometers southwest of Iwo Jima. The typhoon then began to intensify rapidly, with its maximum wind speed increasing from 15 meters per second to 35 meters per second by the following morning. Its speed also began to accelerate, moving northwest-west at 15 kilometers per hour. At this time, Pamila had already become a moderate typhoon.\n\nOn the morning of September 11, Pamila had moved to the waters south of Naha. A strong high-pressure ridge to the north guided it to move west-northwest, with a pressure of 950 millibars and a maximum wind speed of 50 meters per second at its center. It had developed into a strong typhoon by the standards of the time. It suddenly accelerated, increasing from a slow pace to 33 kilometers per hour, and its westward path posed a serious threat to Taiwan. By 8 p.m., Pamila had reached a pressure of 930 millibars, with a peak maximum wind speed of 60 meters per second, and was located about 270 kilometers east of Hualien. At 2 a.m. on the 12th, it made landfall in the area between Yilan and Hualien. Later, it made a second landfall in mainland China. After making landfall in mainland China, Pamila gradually weakened and dissipated."

                "content": "What is truly astonishing is not just that Typhoon Pamela passed directly through the Central Mountain Range, but that despite being a relatively fast-moving typhoon, which generally causes more wind damage than rain, it brought only 100 millimeters of rainfall yet caused severe flooding in the Taipei area. Areas such as Sanchong, Luzhou, Xinzhuang, Yonghe, Shilin, and Dazhi experienced serious flooding. Many of the flooded areas were within the Dahan River basin. In addition to the natural factor of heavy rain, it is said that human factors also played a role. The newly completed Shimen Reservoir upstream of the Dahan River misjudged the situation and suddenly released water. At a time when information was not well-developed, the public was unprepared, leading to catastrophic flooding and casualties in the Dahan River basin. According to data from the police department at the time, Typhoon Pamela caused 153 deaths, 140 missing persons, and 1,874 injuries across Taiwan. A total of 12,349 houses were completely destroyed, and 26,442 houses were partially destroyed, resulting in severe casualties. Many fishing boats also capsized and were damaged. Yilan County bore the brunt of the disaster and suffered unprecedented losses. After the disaster, the Executive Yuan established the \"Taipei Area River Flood Control Plan Review Committee\" to actively implement the Taipei flood control plan."

                "content": "In general, many typhoons passing through Taiwan's Central Mountain Range encounter varying levels of difficulty due to the circulation at different altitudes, which can easily induce a secondary low-pressure center to guide the typhoon across the mountains. However, Typhoon Pamela moved at a very fast speed, crossing the Snow Mountain Range before a secondary low-pressure system could form. By 8 a.m., it had already exited to the northwest of Taichung, spending only a little over five hours on land, which was quite astonishing. During this time, the typhoon's structure was also damaged, downgrading it to a moderate typhoon. While crossing the Snow Mountain Range, due to the influence of wind and terrain, the Foehn effect occurred in the Taitung area, causing temperatures to rise from 27°C at 1 a.m. to 32.3°C at 2 a.m., which lasted until 6 a.m. By 2 p.m., Pamela had entered the mainland and rapidly weakened, transforming into an extratropical cyclone by the next morning.\n\nThe highest average wind speed of Typhoon Pamela was recorded in Keelung City at 35 meters per second, followed by the landfall point in Yilan County at 34.8 meters per second, with the maximum instantaneous gust reaching 44.8 meters per second. In terms of rainfall, Wulai in Taipei County received the most, with 347.2 millimeters during the typhoon's passage over Taiwan. Su'ao Township recorded 319.8 millimeters, Yilan City had 203 millimeters, Taipei City only received 100 millimeters, and the plains in the southwest and eastern regions barely exceeded 50 millimeters. Hengchun Township experienced almost no rainfall (0.9 millimeters).\n\nAdditionally, when Pamela formed, its development was slow during the first three days, and its structure was not very strong. However, it rapidly intensified into a severe typhoon within just two to three days (one of the fastest-developing typhoons in recent years was Typhoon Zeb). It also accelerated from its initial slow movement. The meteorological bureau originally predicted that Pamela would continue moving northwest, but unexpectedly, the high pressure to the north prevented it from moving northward, causing it to shift westward and threaten Taiwan. At the time, meteorological technology was lacking, and there was insufficient maritime data to make accurate predictions. The bureau had to rely on meteorological data from the U.S. military to issue typhoon warnings for Pamela. The bureau initially predicted landfall at 9 a.m. on the 12th, but as the typhoon approached eastern Taiwan, it slowed down to search for a landfall point. However, it unexpectedly made landfall in the Yilan-Hualien border area at 2 a.m., catching meteorologists off guard. It then rapidly crossed the Snow Mountain Range, leaving meteorologists astonished and drawing criticism from the public for the large prediction error. Furthermore, the severe flooding in the Dahan River basin in Taipei was attributed to human factors, highlighting that the issues surrounding Typhoon Pamela were not only about its path but also about human negligence."

The Hong Kong Observatory assessed its central wind speed at 60 kilometers per hour. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also rated this tropical disturbance as \"low,\" indicating a certain probability of developing into a tropical cyclone, but it was ultimately not upgraded to a tropical depression. The tropical depression moved northward, passing between Lantau Island and Hong Kong Island, then crossing Tsing Yi Island, and made landfall near Tsuen Wan before 10:15 PM that evening. It passed through Pat Heung and Kai Kung Leng. The tropical depression left Hong Kong around midnight, entering Shenzhen near Lok Ma Chau.

Due to the formation of a tropical depression within Hong Kong's territory, wind speeds increased rapidly, prompting the Observatory to directly issue the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 9:15 PM. This was the first time since 1993 that the No. 3 Signal was directly issued. At that time, the tropical depression was located about 35 kilometers southwest of the Hong Kong Observatory headquarters. The tropical depression had a diameter of approximately 200 kilometers, with a strong wind radius of about 25 kilometers and a central wind speed of 60 kilometers per hour. The tropical depression came closest to the Observatory headquarters at around 10 PM that night, passing about 10 kilometers west of the headquarters, and then made landfall near Tsuen Wan before 10:15 PM (initial reports suggested landfall around 10:30 PM). It crossed the western New Territories, with winds shifting to the southwest and gradually weakening by early morning. Sustained winds in the eastern regions briefly reached gale force, with a 10-minute average wind speed of 70 kilometers per hour recorded in Sai Kung. \n\nAs the tropical depression moved inland and began to dissipate, the Observatory announced at midnight that the No. 3 Signal would be lowered shortly, and all tropical cyclone warning signals were canceled at 1:45 AM the following day. During the impact of Tropical Depression 618 on Hong Kong, incidents such as scaffolding collapse in Siu Sai Wan and wooden boards falling from a construction site in Chai Wan occurred, but no injuries were reported. \n\nIt is relatively rare for a tropical depression to form so close to land. The last tropical cyclone to form in close proximity was Tropical Storm Lisa in 1996, which formed about 160 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong, requiring only the issuance of the No. 1 Standby Signal. This tropical depression was later referred to as \"Tropical Depression 618.\""

At 2 a.m. on August 31, the tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm in the Beibu Gulf and was named Fitow. At noon on August 31, Fitow made landfall near Qisha Town, Port District, Fangchenggang City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. After landfall, Fitow quickly weakened. By 2 p.m., Fitow had weakened into a tropical depression. By 5 p.m. on September 1, it had completely dissipated. [1] However, the China Meteorological Administration believed that Fitow had not completely dissipated, later re-entered the sea off the eastern Leizhou Peninsula, and made landfall again in Sanya City, Hainan Province, at 5 a.m. on September 10, before dissipating after making landfall in Vietnam at 2 a.m. on September 12. It affected Hainan Province for 16 days, making it the longest-lasting tropical cyclone to affect Hainan Province since 1949. It made landfall on Hainan Island twice and stayed on land for over 72 hours, also making it the longest-lasting tropical cyclone to make landfall on Hainan Island since 1949. [2][3]"

Due to Carmen's impact, Hong Kong and Macau had to hoist the second-highest No. 9 tropical cyclone warning signal for two consecutive years. The storm formed on October 14 over the Philippine Sea, further developing into a typhoon and moving toward central Philippines, where it made landfall. While affecting the Philippines, Carmen weakened temporarily due to terrain effects but reorganized after entering the South China Sea. However, as it approached the coast near the Pearl River Estuary, it was suddenly deflected westward by cold air from Guangdong Province, avoiding landfall, and dissipated south of Shangchuan Island on October 20, with a lifespan of about six days. Carmen caused at least 13 deaths, 9 injuries, and economic losses of 64 million pesos in the Philippines. It brought significant damage to South China but also alleviated drought conditions with its rainfall, prompting the Hong Kong government to fully lift the water rationing measures for that year.

After forming, it moved westward at a speed of approximately 13 kilometers per hour, heading toward central and northern Philippines. [1] The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began monitoring it and assigned it the Philippine name \"Tering\" as it formed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility. [2] The next day, the system shifted to a northwestward movement, and both the Royal Hong Kong Observatory and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical storm, with the latter naming it \"Koinu.\" [3] On the same day, the Central Weather Bureau upgraded it to a mild typhoon. [4][Note 2] The Hong Kong Observatory further upgraded Koinu to a severe tropical storm on the same day. [1] By October 16, Koinu had intensified further. The Hong Kong Observatory analyzed satellite imagery and noted that its circulation was well-organized. Subsequently, reconnaissance aircraft reported a continuous drop in central pressure, prompting the Observatory to follow the U.S. in upgrading it to a typhoon, while the Central Weather Bureau upgraded it to a moderate typhoon on the same day. [3][4][1] Koinu maintained a northwestward direction on the same day and made landfall in central Luzon. It later exited to the sea, entering the northern South China Sea. [1] Koinu's structure was damaged due to the terrain of the Philippines, leading the U.S. to downgrade it to a tropical storm. However, as it moved over the South China Sea, it reorganized, and the U.S. re-upgraded Koinu to a typhoon. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Observatory and the Central Weather Bureau maintained its classification as a typhoon and a moderate typhoon, respectively. [4][1] Later on October 17, Koinu steadily moved to the waters south of the Pearl River Estuary, accelerating to a speed of nearly 17 kilometers per hour. The Hong Kong Observatory observed that its spiral rainbands continued to develop and intensify. [1] On October 18, the Hong Kong Observatory's weather radar captured Koinu's cyclone center, with an eye diameter of nearly 100 kilometers, and indicated that Koinu was turning northwestward, moving closer to the Pearl River Estuary. [1] However, the U.S. and the Central Weather Bureau downgraded it again to a tropical storm and a mild typhoon, respectively, on the same day. [4] At that time, Guangdong Province was under the influence of cold air, which affected Koinu. As it approached the coastal area near the Pearl River Estuary, it suddenly turned westward without making landfall and began to weaken rapidly during the day on October 19. The U.S. and the Central Weather Bureau downgraded it to a tropical depression within the same day, while the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded it to a tropical storm. [3][4][1] The next day, the Hong Kong Observatory reported that Koinu had weakened into a low-pressure area south of Shangchuan Island. [1]"

In Baguio City, landslides occurred in some residential areas. According to Agence France-Presse, a six-year-old girl and her 16-year-old brother lost their lives due to landslides caused by the typhoon, and some members of two families were injured.

[9] As Kaman moved directly towards the coast of South China, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 4:30 pm the same day, when Kaman was steadily moving northwest in the evening. [10] Due to Kaman's increased northward movement, advancing towards the Pearl River Estuary, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal at 10:10 am on October 18. [11] Kaman began to turn northwest by north in the evening, moving closer to Hong Kong. At 4:30 am on October 19, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 9 Gale or Storm Increasing Signal. [12] Kaman was closest to Hong Kong at around 9 am, located approximately 130 kilometers southwest by south of Hong Kong, marking the farthest distance of a storm center from Hong Kong for a No. 9 Signal in history. [1] Affected by a cool and dry northerly airstream, Kaman began to turn west and slowly moved away from Hong Kong. As it was expected that the wind in Hong Kong would not further intensify, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 8 Southeast Signal at 11 am and then with the No. 3 Signal at 3 pm the same day. [13] Kaman continued to weaken under the influence of the airstream and became a low-pressure area south of Shangchuan Island on the morning of October 20. All signals were removed at 10 am that day, with all times in daylight saving time. [14][1] In response to the typhoon, the Education Department announced the suspension of classes in all schools across Hong Kong on October 18 and 19. The Foreign Exchange Bankers' Association announced the temporary closure of all banks in Hong Kong. The four major stock exchanges and the Gold and Silver Exchange suspended trading from the afternoon, some maritime routes ceased services, and some flights were canceled. Land transportation and the Kowloon-Canton Railway provided limited services until gradually stopping in the evening. [15] Some government departments deployed personnel to maintain emergency services and remain on alert, while typhoon shelters in various districts were opened for those in need. [16] Kaman brought continuous heavy rain to Hong Kong. A young man who swam from mainland China to Hong Kong was found lying on the beach at Sharp Nose Point during the No. 9 Signal and was confirmed dead after being sent to the hospital. [17] Another girl was swept away by floodwaters in Kam Tin. [18] The storm caused severe flooding in low-lying areas of urban Kowloon and the New Territories. Authorities also received numerous reports of landslides or road damage, as well as incidents of ships breaking anchor and collisions between two vessels, but no injuries were reported. [19] A severe landslide occurred on the slope behind Lai Sing House in Tai Hang Road due to the storm, submerging the underground parking lot in mud. Hundreds of residents of Lai Sing House had to evacuate overnight. [20] The Third Resettlement Area near Chai Wan Estate was affected by the storm, with seawater flooding the area and causing waterlogging. 800 residents had to evacuate to nearby police stations and Chai Wan Estate for temporary shelter, with the number of evacuees later increasing to over a thousand. After the incident, the resettlement area was left muddy, and many homes were in disarray. [21] More than ten days later, Typhoon Ellen struck Hong Kong, prompting the Observatory to hoist the No. 8 Signal again. As both Kaman and Ellen brought abundant rainfall, a record for the highest October rainfall since the Observatory's establishment was set, along with a significant 220 billion gallons of potable water. The Public Works Department's Water Supplies Department announced the complete cancellation of water rationing measures for that year. [22]"

When Gloria reached the Pearl River Estuary, Hong Kong recorded hurricane-force winds for one hour during the hoisting of the No. 8 signal, prompting the Royal Hong Kong Observatory to directly raise the No. 10 signal. Meanwhile, the Macau Meteorological Bureau did not record sustained hurricane-force winds and thus only raised the No. 9 signal. The observatory recorded 12 hours of strong winds, 14 hours of gale-force winds, and one hour of hurricane-force winds. On September 22, Macau recorded a pressure of 970.8 hPa, an east wind at 110 km/h, gusts reaching 144 km/h, and a maximum daily rainfall of 79.3 mm, causing flooding in low-lying areas of Macau.

At 11:50 am on November 9, the Observatory hoisted the black downward cone, signaling strong east to northeast winds with the possibility of reaching gale force. That afternoon, the typhoon posed a direct threat to Hong Kong, prompting the Observatory to sound the typhoon gun at 6:15 pm, forecasting wind strength to increase to gale force. By 7:30 pm, the Observatory vertically hoisted two lanterns. Between 5:00 am and 6:00 am on November 10, the Observatory recorded the highest average wind speed of 61 knots, equivalent to 113 kilometers per hour, reaching storm force. The typhoon passed over the eastern part of Hong Kong around 6:00 to 7:00 am. Subsequently, the wind in Hong Kong weakened to gale force and shifted to westerly winds, leading the Observatory to replace the black drum at 6:40 am. Later, as the typhoon moved north of Hong Kong, the Observatory hoisted the black upward cone at 8:45 am. In the afternoon, the wind in Hong Kong further subsided, and the Observatory finally removed all typhoon signals at 4:00 pm."

                "content": "In the third decade of July 2013, a heatwave occurred in large parts of Central Europe. In many places, weather stations in Germany recorded temperatures of up to 38 °C. Even along the coasts of the North and Baltic Seas, daily maximum temperatures of up to 32 °C were recorded. Responsible for these temperatures was an upper trough over the eastern Atlantic, which brought hot and humid air directly from the Mediterranean to Germany. Due to this massive warm air advection into Central Europe, temperatures in Germany could reach such heights. On the front side of the trough, so-called shortwave troughs moved from France into Germany during the third and fourth weeks of July. These disturbances repeatedly induced the formation of towering cumulus clouds in Central Europe, which could develop into large thunderstorm complexes in the hot and humid air. For example, on July 25, 2013, severe thunderstorms occurred in France. On July 26 and 27, 2013, further severe storms formed over Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Lower Saxony. In Pforzheim, for instance, hailstones up to 4 cm in size were reported, while in Lower Saxony, particularly in the Hanover metropolitan region, hailstones with diameters of up to 10 cm were recorded. The peak of the heatwave was expected to be reached on July 28, 2013, as the corresponding low-pressure system Andreas advanced further into Germany. On the front side of the associated cold front, a convergence formed over Baden-Württemberg, marking the culmination of the weather event, which would cause the highest insured damages of any hailstorm in German history as well as of any natural disaster worldwide in 2013."

                "content": "In the course of July 28, 2013, the previously inactive convergence until around 3 p.m. lay across Baden-Württemberg. Due to the daytime heating of the air mass, thunderstorms were triggered over the southern Black Forest around 3:30 p.m. Due to favorable atmospheric conditions, the thunderstorms quickly developed into large and well-organized hailstorms, which moved northeastward due to the prevailing southwesterly upper-level flow. During the further development process, two of the thunderstorms formed into so-called supercells. Cities along the Swabian Jura and further towards Bavaria lay in their path. The two cells moved parallel to each other at a distance of about 50 kilometers across Baden-Württemberg. While the northern of the two thunderstorm cells caused only local hail damage in the Schwäbisch Hall district, the southern and stronger cell moved along the Swabian Jura and caused hailstorms of previously undocumented dimensions. The districts of Zollernalb, Tübingen, Reutlingen, Esslingen, and Göppingen, as well as the Ostalbkreis, were particularly hard hit. Here, a swath up to 15 km wide experienced severe hailstorms with hailstones up to 8 cm in size. Reutlingen was hit particularly hard. The fire department control center in Reutlingen registered 10,900 emergency calls in the first two days after the storm. To manage the many emergency sites, fire departments, THW, and other aid organization associations from all over Baden-Württemberg were brought together. At times, up to 120 emergency vehicles and over 800 emergency personnel were deployed in Reutlingen and the surrounding area. After reaching the Bavarian state border, the thunderstorms weakened but still caused flooding and hail damage, especially in the northern district of Bavarian Swabia. Thirteen hours after the first thunderstorms formed, the structures disappeared from radar images."

There, the storm struck around noon. The residential house in Rauðuvík on Árskógsströnd, which was then a newly built timber house, was lifted off its foundation and toppled down the sea cliff it stood on. Eight people were inside, and three died when the house collapsed. Two boats were lost in Hríseyjarsund, taking six men with them, and a farmer in Arnarneshreppur later died from injuries sustained in the storm. Across the country, about 30 people lost their lives due to the storm, and there was also immense property damage. In Svarfaðardalur, people remembered and still remember this storm as the Church Storm of autumn 1900. This was because two of the valley's four churches were blown away and shattered into splinters. These were the churches at Urðir and Upsir. The churches at Tjörn and Vellir were shifted on their foundations, narrowly avoiding major damage."

The typhoon then generally maintained a westward movement until reaching the western South China Sea on the 22nd. Subsequently, a cold front caused the typhoon to turn northeast, resulting in the rare phenomenon of a typhoon reversing direction to the northeast in the western South China Sea. On November 24, the typhoon passed through Macau and, two hours later, its eye directly crossed Hong Kong. The eye lingered over the Hong Kong Observatory for fifteen minutes, marking the first recorded instance of such an occurrence at the observatory. After causing landslides, the typhoon began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone and continued moving northeast across southern China. The storm gradually weakened as it crossed the Taiwan Strait and made landfall in Taiwan before dissipating on the 26th."

It came within 400 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong but did not further move northward to make landfall in western Guangdong. Two days later, it made a sudden 90-degree turn, creating a rare situation of moving directly from west to east towards Hong Kong, passing about 65 kilometers southeast of the Hong Kong Observatory. The Observatory issued the No. 9 signal twice. The cold air from the northeast monsoon also happened to move southward, and the storm transformed into an extratropical cyclone the next day, moving eastward towards Taiwan. The Observatory headquarters recorded strong winds for one hour, with the highest hourly average wind speed at 65 kilometers per hour, coming from the east.\n\nThe Royal Hong Kong Observatory hoisted the No. 1 signal at 8:35 a.m. on November 23, then upgraded to the No. 8 signal at 9:05 a.m. As the storm continued to approach and the wind and rain intensified, the No. 9 signal was issued at 10:05 a.m. At 11:45 a.m., as the wind and rain slightly eased, the Observatory downgraded to the No. 8 signal. However, as the wind and rain intensified again, the No. 9 signal was reissued at 3:51 p.m. At 4:30 p.m., the Observatory downgraded to the No. 5 signal. By 7:05 p.m., all signals were canceled.\n\nWhen Hong Kong was affected by the rainbands ahead of the storm, gusts reached up to 119 km/h. Rainfall began seven hours before the typhoon's arrival, resulting in a total of approximately 108 mm of rainfall. The heaviest rainfall came from the pre-typhoon rainbands, with 40 mm recorded within one hour. The lowest pressure recorded during the typhoon's passage over Hong Kong was 989.0 hPa. The typhoon caused minor damage in Hong Kong. In Kowloon City’s Tung Tau Estate, a mud wall collapsed, killing two people. In Kowloon Bay, a cargo boat was overturned by the wind, causing five people to fall into the sea, with one person sustaining minor injuries."

On August 18, the Dutch steamship Sapoeroea recorded the typhoon's lowest sea-level pressure at only 886.7 hPa (26.185 inches of mercury) 460 nautical miles (740 kilometers) east of Luzon, making it the tropical cyclone with the lowest sea-level pressure recorded globally at the time, until it was surpassed by Typhoon Ida's 877 hPa in 1958. Later on the evening of August 18 to early August 19, the typhoon made landfall or brushed past the northeastern coast of Luzon, where Aparri recorded a minimum pressure of 969.9 hPa (727.5 mmHg). After passing through Luzon, the typhoon entered the northern South China Sea, and at 6 a.m. on August 19, it was located near the northern coast of Luzon, moving northwest to west-northwest. At 6 a.m. on August 20, the center was northwest of Pratas Island, passing within 10 nautical miles of the island, where winds reached force 11 and the pressure dropped to 967.1 hPa (725.42 mmHg). The typhoon subsequently passed south of Hong Kong and Macau. During the storm, Hong Kong recorded a minimum sea-level pressure of 982.4 hPa, an average wind speed of 98 km/h (53 knots), and gusts of 187 km/h (101 knots). In Macau, the pressure dropped to a minimum of 974.1 hPa (730.6 mmHg), with average wind speeds and gusts reaching 135 km/h and 190 km/h, respectively. Later on the evening of August 20 to August 21, the typhoon made landfall in western Guangdong and gradually dissipated."

In Hong Kong, during the period when the gale signal was hoisted, the Observatory recorded hurricane-force winds for one hour, leading the Observatory to skip the No. 6 signal and directly hoist the No. 7 signal. This was the first time the Observatory had done so since the establishment of the gale enhancement signal."

According to reports from Hong Kong newspapers at the time, the Hong Kong Observatory believed that the storm formed on the afternoon of August 20 at 19 degrees north latitude, approximately 159 miles west of northern Luzon, moving northwestward. By 2 a.m. on the 21st, it shifted northward and passed east of Dongsha Island at 2 p.m. the same day before turning northwest. By 1:30 p.m. on the 22nd, the storm reached south of Hong Kong, made landfall near Macau, moved inland, and dissipated thereafter. [1]"

On August 18, the typhoon moved closer to Hong Kong. The Observatory hoisted the No. 6 typhoon signal at 8:23 a.m., and strong winds began to blow in Hong Kong from 9 a.m., prompting the Observatory to hoist the No. 7 typhoon signal at 9 a.m. Hurricane-force winds were recorded in Hong Kong at 10 a.m., with the typhoon's center passing a few miles south of Hong Kong. The lowest pressure recorded in Hong Kong was 971.7 hPa, with the highest hourly sustained wind speed at 72 knots (133 km/h) and gusts reaching 113 knots (209 km/h). Shortly after, the wind direction shifted to east-southeast, and wind speeds rapidly decreased as the typhoon moved away, with strong winds lasting only three hours.\n\nThe storm caused severe casualties and damage in Hong Kong, with storm surges occurring in the harbor. The sea level rose to 3.2 meters in the harbor, and a storm surge height of 4.57 meters was recorded in Tai Po. At least 100 people died, including at least 40 fishermen, and one person went missing. The massive waves caused significant damage to the sea and coastal areas. The British Navy submarine HMS L9 was swept out of the naval dockyard by the waves, destroying the dockyard's outer wall and eventually sinking near the Star Ferry Pier on the Hong Kong side. A steamship traveling between China and India was swept from Kowloon Bay to the Yau Ma Tei pier by the waves and sank. Along the coastline from Shau Kei Wan to Stonecutters Island, 20 ships were washed ashore, some severely damaged, with at least two fatalities. Ninety percent of the ships docked at the Taikoo Dockyard sank, resulting in significant losses. In the Shau Kei Wan typhoon shelter, over 300 sailing boats or sampans sank, were damaged, or were stranded. Some sampans in Causeway Bay were even thrown onto the roads. In Yau Ma Tei, eight sampans were piled up on the seawall, with two thrown onto land. The waves also destroyed a monument near the Hong Kong Club, broke wooden planks at the Central Blake Pier, and deformed parts of the Star Ferry Pier. The asphalt on Connaught Road was also overturned.\n\nIn Tai Po, the storm surge caused severe damage to the coastline. The seawall near the railway in the Tolo Harbour area was destroyed, disrupting train services. A 40-foot embankment at Tai Po Kau pier was destroyed. Several embankments in Sha Tin were washed away, destroying rice crops. A family of six in the area was hit by the storm surge, resulting in four deaths. Tai O experienced even stronger winds, with 12 houses and 19 huts collapsing, though no fatalities were reported. The storm temporarily disrupted the ongoing East Reclamation Project along the waterfront. After the storm, the reclaimed soil was washed away, but it did not flow into the sea, so the project was ultimately not significantly affected."

According to Joaquim Baião Simões' book \"Macau and the Typhoons (Macau e os Tufões),\" the typhoon caused significant damage to Macau, destroying and damaging approximately 200 houses and 24 shipyards, with 50 various types of ships sunk. The disaster resulted in over 400 deaths and 52 injuries in Macau."

The Hong Kong Observatory and the Marine Department hoisted Typhoon Signal No. 2[1], marking the first time this signal was hoisted since the simplification of the typhoon signal system on October 20, 1943. After the hoisting of Signal No. 2, three ferry routes between Central and Heung To, Tai Kok, and Castle Peak were suspended starting in the morning[1], until the signal was lowered. Regarding land transportation, only passenger bicycles and rickshaws continued to operate in the wind and rain[1]. Businesses along both sides of Victoria Harbour closed their doors and windows tightly, pedestrians were sparse, and the streets were quiet. Many shop signs fell in various locations[1]. Around 8 a.m., a floating corpse was found near the Central Keng Shan Pier[1], suspected to be a victim of a sunken boat, which was later swept away by large waves. The doors and windows of a shop along the waterfront in Chung Sum Kee were destroyed by the wind[1], and one vacant building each on First Street in the Water City District and Gough Street in Central collapsed[1], causing no casualties. The district officer of the lowland area, accompanied by an administrative officer, toured the streets in the wind and rain in the morning[1], giving instructions to citizens on typhoon precautions. By noon, the wind and rain had weakened, and the Marine Department lowered Typhoon Signal No. 2 in the afternoon[1]. The \"Hong Kong Maru\" ship, originally scheduled to depart from Hong Kong to Guangdong Province at 8 p.m., had to be delayed by a day due to the still-strong winds[1]. Prices rose significantly due to the typhoon's impact on supply, with the price of rice increasing from HK$7.2 per catty on July 21 to a peak of HK$8 on the 22nd[1]. Sweet potatoes rose from HK$2.9 per catty on the eve of the storm to over HK$3[1], and the supply of fish and vegetables was tight, with prices also increasing."

They immediately ordered the hoisting of Signal No. 1 at the Guia Fortress, the Maritime Administration, and the Guia Lighthouse. On the afternoon of July 21, the weather in Macau deteriorated with heavy rain, and at around 7 p.m., Signal No. 5 was hoisted, warning of possible strong northwest winds. The city experienced strong winds and heavy rain, and ferry services between the Macau Peninsula and Taipa were suspended. Ships sought shelter in the Inner Harbour typhoon shelter. At around 2 a.m. on July 22, the winds intensified, and Signal No. 9 was hoisted. The Maritime Administration's rescue ferry ventured out to patrol the Outer Harbour in case of emergencies. At around 7 a.m. on July 22, the typhoon appeared to be directly impacting Macau. At 8:30 a.m., the Meteorological Department ordered the replacement of Signal No. 9 with Signal No. 10, the first in three years. The Guia Fortress fired three cannon shots to warn of the approaching hurricane. Macau experienced a day of strong winds and heavy rain, with the Outer Harbour area being the most threatened. However, as the typhoon quickly passed south of Macau without directly crossing it, overall damage was minimal. An unmanned boat sank at sea, the New Reclamation swimming area was destroyed, the Nam Van Friendship Stadium was damaged, and many rooftop drying racks and shop signs were blown away. Several small trees on Avenida de Venceslau de Morais were uprooted. A shipyard in the Areia Preta area collapsed, causing significant cargo losses but no casualties. Streets such as Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro, Rua da Felicidade, Rua dos Mercadores, Rua da Praia do Manduco, and the San Kio district were flooded, with water levels exceeding one foot in some areas. Several old houses on Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro collapsed, injuring a police officer. By midday on July 22, the winds weakened and shifted to a southerly direction. At 12:50 p.m., the Guia Fortress fired two cannon shots to signal the end of the hurricane threat, and Signal No. 6 was hoisted. At 7 p.m., Signal No. 1 was hoisted again, and all signals were removed before midnight."

It moved west or west-northwest at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour. Initially, Becky remained at tropical depression strength, with maximum winds only reaching gale force. However, after entering the waters of the Balintang Channel, it strengthened into a tropical storm and was named \"Becky.\" At that time, its movement speed significantly increased, moving west-northwest at 30 kilometers per hour into the northern South China Sea. On September 17, Becky intensified into a severe tropical storm about 50 kilometers southwest of the Dongsha Islands and accelerated again, moving at 34 kilometers per hour toward the western coast of the Pearl River Estuary. On the same day, it made landfall in Chixi Town, Taishan City, Guangdong Province. Becky quickly weakened into a tropical storm about 200 kilometers northeast of Zhanjiang City. On September 18, it weakened into a tropical depression near Liuzhou City in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and dissipated a few hours later in northern Ha Giang Province, Vietnam."

The Observatory issued the No. 1 Standby Signal at 9:30 am on September 16, when Becky was located about 660 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. Initially, the weather was generally clear with light winds. As Becky approached, the northeast wind strengthened, and squalls and thunderstorms began to affect Hong Kong. The Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 10:30 pm that night. Due to continued strengthening winds, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal at 2:50 am on September 17. According to the Observatory's tropical cyclone report, Becky was closest to Hong Kong at around 7 am, located about 110 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. In fact, some citizens and former Observatory staff pointed out that Becky was closest to Hong Kong at around 9 am, located about 90 kilometers southwest of the Hong Kong Observatory, consistent with the Observatory's radar positioning and clear media reports at the time. However, the Observatory overturned the real-time positioning in the 1993 Tropical Cyclone Annual Report and did not acknowledge that Becky had reached hurricane-force winds, meaning it entered within 100 kilometers of Hong Kong at typhoon strength, meeting the conditions for issuing a higher signal. A former Observatory staff member pointed out that starting at around 8 am that morning, Cheung Chau experienced several hours of sustained hurricane-force winds. Before the Cheung Chau wind station went into maintenance mode, it recorded a maximum hourly average wind speed of 139 kilometers per hour, indicating that Becky had reached typhoon strength and brought hurricane-force winds to southwestern Hong Kong. This proves that the Observatory's classification of Becky as a severe tropical storm was a significant underestimation of its intensity, and not issuing the No. 10 Hurricane Signal was a serious mistake. At 8 am that morning, Shek Lau Wan and Wong Chuk Hang also recorded maximum hourly average wind speeds of 99 and 62 kilometers per hour, respectively, which were higher than the 87 and 54 kilometers per hour recorded during Super Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018. The Observatory headquarters also recorded a minimum instantaneous sea-level pressure of 997.3 hPa. As the wind shifted to the southeast, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal at 7:30 am. On that day, Hong Kong generally experienced gale to storm-force winds, with hurricane-force winds persisting in the western and southern areas, offshore waters, and highlands until Becky made landfall in western Guangdong. Showers decreased in the afternoon, and the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 3:10 pm, replacing the No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal, when Becky was located about 270 kilometers west of Hong Kong. All tropical cyclone warning signals were canceled at 5 pm. During Becky's impact on Hong Kong, 1 person died, and 130 people were injured. [2]"

On September 17, as Typhoon Becky approached with strong winds and heavy rain, the bureau hoisted Typhoon Signal No. 3 at 12:30 a.m. and Typhoon Signal No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal at 6:30 a.m. Due to the continued strengthening of winds and the typhoon's closer approach to Macao, Typhoon Signal No. 9 was hoisted at 9:00 a.m. At the same time, the Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge recorded the highest hourly average wind speed of 124 km/h, marking the first time hurricane-force sustained winds were recorded in the region. The main station at Mount Fortress recorded a maximum hourly wind speed of 73 km/h, while the Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge recorded the highest gust of 166 km/h at 9:23 a.m., with the lowest instantaneous sea-level pressure at 982.3 hPa. During this period, coinciding with astronomical high tide, low-lying areas such as the Inner Harbor, San Kio, and Ilha Verde experienced seawater flooding. The water level on Rua Cinco de Outubro even reached thigh height, and the Macao Water Supply Company's plant in Ilha Verde was affected by flooding, temporarily halting water supply. Numerous incidents of structural collapse occurred across the city: one side of the exterior wall and windows of the Global Hotel near Tap Seac Square were blown down by strong winds; a large tree fell in the parking area at Senado Square, crushing several cars; a large section of scaffolding collapsed near the CEM building on Rua do Almirante Sérgio; and many shanties along the Lin Ma Hang and Fai Chi Kei waterfronts were destroyed. The seawall near the old Outer Harbor Ferry Terminal on Avenida da Amizade was severely damaged by waves, and the terminal facilities were also affected. Subsequently, as Typhoon Becky moved away from Macao, the Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau replaced Typhoon Signal No. 8 Southwest Gale or Storm Signal at 10:30 a.m., then Typhoon Signal No. 3 at 1:30 p.m., and finally canceled all signals at 4:00 p.m. Typhoon Becky caused a total of 43 injuries in Macao, with 2 people seriously injured, and over 1,700 people had to take shelter at the Ilha Verde disaster relief center. Due to damage to facilities, hydrofoil ferry services between Hong Kong and Macao remained suspended as of 9:00 p.m. on September 17 and only fully resumed the following day. At the Transmac bus depot in Areia Preta, nearly 50 buses were completely flooded and paralyzed. After overnight emergency repairs, 30 buses were operational the next day."

On the morning of September 17, 1993, Becky passed about 90 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong and approximately 45 kilometers south-southwest of Macau. The Hong Kong Observatory and the Macau Geophysical and Meteorological Bureau only issued the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal and the No. 9 Signal. However, hurricane-force winds persisted in the western and southern areas of Hong Kong, offshore waters, and highlands, while Macau experienced widespread hurricane-force winds. This not only met the criteria for the No. 10 Signal in both regions but also indicated that Becky was indeed a typhoon. This highlights the poor forecasting ability and accuracy of the meteorological departments in Hong Kong and Macau at the time regarding rapidly intensifying and accelerating tropical cyclones near the coast, as well as their low responsiveness to sudden situations. Although many years have passed since Becky struck Hong Kong and Macau, many residents and weather enthusiasts in both regions still point out in forums that the meteorological departments underestimated its intensity and question the rationale for not issuing higher signals, which continues to spark considerable debate."

According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, similar wind speeds had previously been observed on land areas in August 1959 before Janika. The storm caused the most damage in Pirkanmaa, Häme, Eastern Häme, and Uusimaa. The storm claimed at least one life when the son of the Centre Party Member of Parliament Olavi Ala-Nissilä died. The Janika storm and the earlier Pyry storm in November together caused approximately 7.3 million cubic meters of forest damage."

                "content": "The Lofoten storm of 1849 is reported to have occurred off the coast of Lofoten on February 11, 1849. Hans H.S. Schulze's travelogue from Nordland, published in 1865, mentions a storm on this day in which 500 men were said to have drowned: \"No year passes without the sea claiming its victims during the winter fishing; but the loss of a couple of boat crews is considered only a small tribute to the waves. However, in certain years, greater disasters occur, which remain in the fishermen's memory for a long time. On February 11, 1848, as far as I recall, such a day of disaster occurred, and even the bravest fishermen turn pale when they speak of this day. How many people perished is not easy to know, as the fishing villages have little connection with each other; but it was estimated that about 500 men perished...\" In Tromsø Tidende on February 25, 1849, a report on the front page states: \"In Lofoten, the fishing has started well and is successful in both East and West Lofoten. The weather was very harsh, and many boats are said to have been lost in the storm.\" Professor Narve Fulsås, in Historisk Tidsskrift (2001), points out that investigations in newspapers from the relevant time cast doubt on both the date and the number of casualties, suggesting that a figure as high as 500 fatalities is likely an exaggeration. He believes Schulze, in his book published 16 years later, must have gotten the year wrong. However, the Tromsø newspaper confirms that there was a storm in 1849 and that many boats were lost. It is impossible to obtain exact information about the accident. Fulsås argues that no one at the time was capable of having such a comprehensive overview. Furthermore, it is difficult today to conduct a follow-up investigation since both the church and parish records in Vågan were destroyed in the Vågan church fire in 1865. In the church book for Buksnes municipality in Nordland (1849), there is a list of 24 people who perished at sea on February 11. Seventeen widows were left behind in the municipality after this tragedy."

                "content": "Storm Gorm (in the United Kingdom; Clodagh, in Germany; Nils II) was a storm that hit all of Denmark on Sunday, November 29, 2015. The storm made landfall on the west coast of Jutland, resulting in major flooding in places such as Hvide Sande. In the Limfjord, the water level rose by about 1.6 meters after the storm, which was, however, less than during Storm Egon in January of the same year. The storm's strongest winds swept across the country, with the central part of the country being particularly hard hit. The storm closed most of Denmark's bridges, including both the old and new Little Belt Bridge, the Vejle Fjord Bridge, the Great Belt Bridge, and the Øresund Bridge. Train traffic was suspended in many parts of the country; for example, all S-trains were canceled during the storm's worst hours. Copenhagen Airport experienced delays on many flights. Police in Southern Jutland, Central Jutland, and Funen advised against all unnecessary travel. A football match between FC Midtjylland and FC Copenhagen was canceled due to the storm. In East Jutland, 37,000 residents lost power as several high-voltage lines were hit by flying debris. In Sweden, nearly 50,000 households lost power as a result of the storm. Around 31,000 were in southern Sweden, but 5,000 homes on Gotland were also affected. In Brabrand near Aarhus, the roof of a residential block was blown off. However, there were no injuries. Many trees, weakened by the two previous storms Allan and Bodil, fell during Gorm. In the Lake Highlands, between 7,000 and 7,500 m³ of forest were toppled, and in Randers and on Djursland, around 2,000 m³ fell. A 74-year-old man with dementia from Nykøbing Sjælland was the only fatality of Storm Gorm. He was found dead on November 30, 2015."

                "content": "In late August 1911, a typhoon formed in the southern Pacific Ocean. This typhoon passed through the Philippines, Taiwan, and East Asia, causing significant damage. On August 21, meteorological observations from Guam and Yap Island indicated that a typhoon was gathering west of the Mariana Islands, moving west or west-northwest. By August 23, the typhoon began affecting the Philippines, with areas about 500 miles (805 kilometers) east of Luzon experiencing pressure drops and wind direction changes due to the typhoon's circulation. On the 24th, signs of the typhoon's arrival were observed on the small northern Philippine island of Basco. Early on the 26th, the pressure at the Basco weather station began to plummet, wind speeds increased, and rainfall was recorded. Between midnight and 7 a.m., the wind direction shifted from north-northeast to north, then to northwest-north. By 7 a.m. on the 26th, the pressure recording paper dropped below the lower limit of 715 mmHg (953.3 hPa). At 8 a.m., the wind direction shifted to northwest, but the rain stopped. At 8:20 a.m., Basco entered the typhoon's eye, the sky became calm, and the sun was visible. Sustained wind speeds dropped to level 4, though strong gusts still occurred. At 9 a.m., wind speeds suddenly increased, and the wind direction shifted from northwest to west-southwest. For several hours afterward, hurricane-force winds persisted, with the wind direction changing to southwest. By noon, the pressure recording paper showed a rise above 715 mmHg (953.3 hPa), and the pressure continued to rise as the wind weakened and the typhoon gradually moved away from Basco. Due to the pressure recording paper dropping below its limit, the lowest pressure recorded locally is unknown. However, based on the pressure curve, it is estimated that the lowest pressure recorded in Basco may have reached 690 mmHg (920 hPa) or lower.\n\nAfter passing Basco, the typhoon approached Taiwan, with Hengchun being the first to be affected. The pressure continued to drop. At 10 p.m. on August 26, Hengchun recorded a minimum hourly pressure of 702.9 mmHg (937.1 hPa) and a maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed of 34.4 meters per second. According to the Central Weather Bureau's path map, the typhoon did not make landfall in Hengchun but passed very close to its western coastal waters before possibly making landfall in southwestern Taiwan. At 4:45 a.m. on the 27th, Tainan recorded a minimum pressure of 726.8 mmHg (969 hPa) and a maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed of 38.2 meters per second (or 54.5 meters per second according to another source [Reference 2]), the highest sustained wind speed ever recorded in Tainan. Tainan's 24-hour rainfall on the 27th was 384.9 mm, ranking fourth in daily accumulated rainfall [Reference 1:81]. During the typhoon, Tainan's total rainfall was 423.8 mm, while Hengchun's total rainfall was 515.4 mm. The chief scientist at the Hengchun Weather Station stated that the typhoon's intensity was extremely strong, with almost no houses left undamaged. Unfortunately, the anemometer cups were blown away, so the maximum wind speed could not be recorded. However, he estimated that the maximum wind speed could have reached 70 meters per second.\n\nAfter passing Taiwan, the typhoon moved northwest-north and made landfall in China. By August 28, its remnants were located southwest of Shanghai, moving northwest. On August 29, it moved west of Shanghai and dissipated inland."

Since most early buildings were made of wood, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office adopted brick and reinforced concrete for public building reconstruction plans after the disaster. For example, Taipei City experienced flooding due to the typhoon, with areas like Dadaocheng severely affected by collapsed houses. The government took this opportunity to implement urban improvement and street house reconstruction plans, introducing architectural and facade style elements from European architecture for street rebuilding. In 1912, the following year, areas such as Beidou, Nantou, and Daxi, which were affected by the typhoon and flooding, also drafted urban improvement plans. Tainan suffered severe damage from the storm. Preliminary statistics on building damage in the Fucheng area showed that 86 private houses were completely or partially destroyed, with many others flooded, and six warehouses damaged. Regarding public buildings, 80% of Tainan's administrative offices were damaged, including the Tainan Office Affairs Room, General Affairs Section, and the east and west markets. Historical sites such as the Five Sons Shrine of Chihkan Tower were damaged, and decorative ceramic figures on the roof of the Liangguang Guild Hall were peeled off. In the Anping area, nearly 200 houses were completely or partially destroyed, with two injuries and two deaths, and four ships capsized in the harbor. At that time, the largest market in Fucheng, the West Market, saw its entire first-generation wooden structure destroyed. Therefore, when rebuilding the West Market in 1912, durability was considered, and the most advanced R.C. construction method in Taiwan at the time was used to build three buildings, with the central building being two stories high. The storm also caused the Zhuoshui River railway bridge to be washed away, disrupting the north-south railway line."

                "content": "As early as August 17, a broad low-pressure area formed northeast of Luzon, Philippines. At that time, this low-pressure area remained stationary in the Luzon Strait due to the influence of the high-pressure ridges over the western Pacific and southeastern China. On August 18, the high-pressure area over southeastern China weakened, and sudden rain began to appear in southern China, causing the system to start moving westward. However, it was also affected by strong vertical wind shear in the northern South China Sea, showing no signs of developing into a tropical cyclone. Despite this, the low-pressure area did not dissipate; instead, its storm circle continued to expand. Later, on August 20, the vertical wind shear affecting the northern South China Sea began to weaken, and the Japan Meteorological Agency classified the system as a tropical disturbance after it entered the South China Sea. By midnight on August 21, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression, as it had already moved to the northern South China Sea near the Dongsha Islands. \n\nAt 8 a.m. on August 22, the Hong Kong Observatory also upgraded the system to a tropical depression, as it was located about 670 kilometers south of Hong Kong, within the 800-kilometer range of Hong Kong. However, due to the weak intensity of the tropical depression and its storm circle being concentrated in the central South China Sea, it did not bring immediate severe weather to Hong Kong, only causing slight swells in the southern waters of Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong Observatory did not issue the Standby Signal No. 1. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center classified the system as a tropical depression in the afternoon of August 22, designating it as the sixth tropical cyclone warning (06W) issued in the western Pacific. \n\nOn the morning of August 23, the system intensified into a tropical storm, named Pabuk, and was expected to generally move toward the Gulf of Tonkin. That evening, the Hong Kong Observatory and the China Meteorological Administration upgraded Pabuk to a severe tropical storm. On August 24, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning for the system. On the morning of August 25, the Hong Kong Observatory and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression and a low-pressure area, respectively."

In Denmark, Norway, and the Faroe Islands, wind gusts in several places exceeded the hurricane threshold of 32.6 m/s, and on the Faroe Islands, the average wind speed was measured at 52 m/s. The wind came from Iceland and areas north of it. In the United Kingdom, it was named Storm Conor. In Germany, it was named Barbara, which should not be confused with another storm that passed over the British Isles. The storm was named by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, which is why it was not given a male name starting with I, as it would have been if it had been named by DMI. On the Faroe Islands, Urd set a Faroese record for wind strength, as wind gusts of 78.7 m/s at Norðadalsskarð reached over double hurricane strength, while the average wind speed was 52 m/s. In Norway, Urd also exceeded hurricane strength at certain measuring stations. The highest measured wind speed in Norway was 53.3 m/s, recorded at Elvershei at the top of Røldal Ski Center at midnight on Boxing Day. In Scotland, an average wind speed of 44.2 m/s was measured at a weather station located at an altitude of 1,237 meters.

Both the highest wind speed in sustained winds (over ten minutes) and gusts were measured in Thorsminde, where the recorded figures reached 29.4 m/s and 37.8 m/s, respectively. The wind speed was suitable for wind turbines, which meant that the electricity price was on average negative on both December 25 and 26. Urd caused no personal injuries but resulted in material damage, partly due to a storm surge that took several meters of the coastline. The Storm Council declared a storm surge in certain parts of the country on December 27, 2016. The storm surge caused rising water levels in several areas of the country. In the Limfjord, the water level reached 2.8 meters above normal, while on the west coast of Jutland, it reached as high as 3.4 meters. The area around Roskilde Fjord was also affected. In addition to material damage, Urd also impacted fishing, as it both prevented fishermen from going out to sea and displaced fish, resulting in fewer catches. The chairman of the fish traders estimated just before New Year that 10% of the normal catch was landed. This also affected cod prices, which were expected to double compared to the normal price. Both before and during Urd's impact, up to 1,500 people were on duty to minimize the damage. Urd caused flying debris and broken trees in North Jutland, where authorities advised against going outside due to the danger to life. In some places, scaffolding was at risk of collapsing. Additionally, Urd disrupted traffic, including cutting power to train lines on Zealand due to fallen trees, causing delays in Jutland, and canceling the ferry between Gedser and Rostock. However, overall, fewer damages occurred compared to Allan, Bodil, and Gorm. The Øresund Bridge was temporarily closed, and at other times, wind-sensitive vehicles were advised against crossing the Øresund Bridge, Svendborgsund Bridge, and Vejlefjord Bridge. Subsequently, 36 practice grenades were found at Jægerspris. They had been buried under the sand but were exposed by Urd. At Risø DTU, the water came within one meter of a building housing 5,000 barrels of nuclear waste. The building is located 2.43 meters above sea level and is the lowest-lying building in the area. The building was also at risk during Storm Bodil in 2013, when the water came within 40 cm of the building."

                "content": "The Faroe Islands were hit by several hurricanes and storms around Christmas and New Year. It started with a storm on December 20, with hurricane-force gusts of at least 49 m/s.  \nHurricane Barbara hit the islands on Christmas Eve and lasted until midday on Christmas Day. The hurricane had an average wind speed of 30-40 m/s throughout the evening, and a gust at Norðadalsskarð of 70 m/s broke the record of 66.9 m/s, which was measured on March 7, 1997, at Mykines Lighthouse. The emergency center in Tórshavn received 256 reports of storm damage, most of them from Suðuroy. The hurricane caused central Faroe Islands and Klaksvík to lose electricity for about an hour late on Christmas Eve. Hurricane Urd hit the islands at midday on Christmas Day and lasted until the morning of the second day of Christmas, with an average wind speed of 52 m/s. Hurricane Urd caused significant damage to buildings, cars, and boats, and a woman was injured, breaking her leg when a gust of wind knocked her over. Klaksvík was severely affected, with several cars flying through the air. Roofs and house claddings were torn off several houses and flew through the air, causing even more damage. In the village of Kambsdalur in Eysturoy, an entire factory hall was torn from its foundation and flew through the air. The villages around Skálafjørður were also heavily affected by damage. In Tórshavn, there was also significant damage, as in several other places in the Faroe Islands. According to the Rescue Service in Tórshavn (Tórshavnar Sløkkilið), they received about 130-150 reports of damage in Tórshavn and central Faroe Islands, and they lost control of the situation as it was not possible to drive between all the villages. For example, a man in Norðadalur was alone in trying to save a building. A young woman from Runavík went into labor during the hurricane, and since it was not advisable to drive to the National Hospital in Tórshavn due to the bad weather, she had to give birth at home. However, a midwife and two porters braved the storm and drove to her home to assist with the birth, which went well. The radar installation on top of the Sornfelli mountain, built by NATO in 1963 for warning against attacks from the east by bombers, was heavily damaged during Hurricane Urd on the second day of Christmas. There are two domes on Sornfelli, both of which were damaged during the storm; one was completely torn from its foundation, while the other was damaged. The domes were established as an extension of the American/Canadian DEW-Line (Distant Early Warning Line). After the hurricane, the radar is inoperative and needs repair. There are 352 plates in each dome, and ten years earlier, each plate cost 24,000 kroner. The radar usually sends images of the airspace over the Faroe Islands to air traffic. The rescue organizations in the Faroe Islands, which are largely based on volunteers, had radio equipment inside the dome on Sornfelli that was blown away in the storm, and all their equipment was destroyed. It was a gift from the Netherlands and had a value of 400,000 kroner. For unknown reasons, it was not insured. It was also very windy on the night of December 28, and there was some damage, for example, part of the railing on the bridge over Sandá, which connects Tórshavn and Argir and opened earlier in the year, was torn loose. There were also reports of fallen trees and roofs being torn off. According to the police in the Faroe Islands, they received about 650 reports of damage in one week, while they usually receive about 800 reports in an entire year. On the evening of December 29, 2016, there was another hurricane in certain parts of the Faroe Islands, which came quite unexpectedly as no hurricane warning had been issued. There was more damage, including in Tvøroyri, where part of the roof blew off a pub by the harbor, as well as other damage to windows and house claddings in the central part of the town. There was also damage in Klaksvík, where a roof was torn off a house, and on the outskirts of Tórshavn, where a container was blown over a cliff and later ended up on a busy road leading from the capital to the northern part of the island of Streymoy. However, the police managed to close the road before half of the container tipped over the edge and onto the roadway. The police received over 20 reports of damage. In some places, gusts of wind were measured at 62.7 m/s, and the average wind speed was 43.4 m/s. Several of SEV's wind turbines in Húsahagi near Tórshavn and in Neshagi on Eysturoy were damaged during the Christmas hurricanes in 2016. One of the wind turbines in Neshagi measured wind speeds of up to 76 meters per second during the Christmas hurricanes. In the same location, during another hurricane, wind gusts of up to 82 m/s were measured. The Norwegian salmon farming company Marine Harvest's Faroese division had been experimenting with salmon farming at Sandsvág near the village of Sandur. It was still in the experimental stage when Hurricane Urd and the other hurricanes around Christmas hit the Faroe Islands. The company had two pens with 50,000 salmon in each pen, and the winter of 2016/17 was the first winter with salmon in the pens; before that, they had conducted measurements with empty pens. After the hurricanes around Christmas 2016, Marine Harvest found that the pens had withstood the hurricanes well, but the salmon had not; a significant portion of them had died. They therefore decided to slaughter the surviving salmon as well. There had been very high waves and strong ocean currents at Sandsvág during the hurricanes, which the salmon apparently could not tolerate. Marine Harvest planned to investigate further before deciding whether to continue with salmon farming at Sandsvág. On January 2, 2017, the two major insurance companies in the Faroe Islands reported that they had received approximately 2,400 claims for damages due to the Christmas hurricanes, which they estimated at around 45-50 million Danish kroner. Tryggingarfelagið Føroyar had received 1,700 claims, which they estimated would cost 30 million kroner, while Trygd had received 700 claims, which they estimated would cost 15-20 million kroner. However, it was too early to say exactly how extensive the damages were. By January 16, 2017, the number of damages from the Christmas hurricanes in the Faroe Islands had risen to 3,000 and was estimated to cost insurance companies 75 million kroner. The largest and most expensive damage occurred when a commercial building in Kambsdalur was torn from its foundation and blown away. Tryggingarfelagið Føroyar received a total of 2,335 claims for damages, which were estimated to cost between 40 and 45 million kroner, while the insurance company Trygd received a total of 1,011 claims for storm damages, which were estimated to cost over 30 million kroner to compensate."

There are two domes on Sornfelli, both of which were damaged during the storm; one was completely torn from its foundation, while the other was damaged. The domes were established as an extension of the American/Canadian DEW-Line (Distant Early Warning Line). After the hurricane, the radar is inoperative and needs repair. There are 352 plates in each dome, and ten years earlier, each plate cost 24,000 kroner. The radar usually sends images of the airspace over the Faroe Islands to air traffic. The rescue organizations in the Faroe Islands, which are largely based on volunteers, had radio equipment inside the dome on Sornfelli that was blown away in the storm, and all their equipment was destroyed. It was a gift from the Netherlands and had a value of 400,000 kroner. For unknown reasons, it was not insured. It was also very windy on the night of December 28, and there were some damages, such as part of the railing on the bridge over Sandá, which connects Tórshavn and Argir and opened earlier that year, being torn loose. There were also reports of fallen trees and roofs being torn off. According to the police in the Faroe Islands, they received about 650 reports of damage in one week, while they usually receive about 800 reports in an entire year. On the evening of December 29, 2016, there was another hurricane in certain parts of the Faroe Islands, which came quite unexpectedly as no hurricane warning had been issued. Several damages occurred, including in Tvøroyri, where part of the roof blew off a pub by the harbor, as well as other damages to windows and house claddings in the central part of the town. There were also damages in Klaksvík, where a roof was torn off a house, and on the outskirts of Tórshavn, where a container was blown over a cliff and later ended up on a busy road leading from the capital to the northern part of the island of Streymoy. However, the police managed to close the road before half of the container tipped over the edge and onto the roadway. The police received over 20 reports of damage. In some places, gusts of wind were measured at 62.7 m/s, and the average wind speed was 43.4 m/s. Several of SEV's wind turbines in Húsahagi near Tórshavn and in Neshagi on Eysturoy were damaged during the Christmas hurricanes in 2016. One of the wind turbines in Neshagi measured wind speeds of up to 76 meters per second during the Christmas hurricanes. In the same location, during another hurricane, wind gusts of up to 82 m/s were measured. The Norwegian salmon farming company Marine Harvest's Faroese division had been experimenting with salmon farming at Sandsvág near the village of Sandur. It was still in the experimental stage when Hurricane Urd and the other hurricanes around Christmas hit the Faroe Islands. The company had two pens with 50,000 salmon in each pen, and the winter of 2016/17 was the first winter with salmon in the pens; before that, they had conducted measurements with empty pens. After the hurricanes around Christmas 2016, Marine Harvest found that the pens had withstood the hurricanes well, but the salmon had not; a significant portion of them had died. They therefore decided to also slaughter the surviving salmon. There had been very high waves and very strong ocean currents at Sandsvág during the hurricanes, which the salmon apparently could not tolerate. Marine Harvest planned to investigate the situation further before deciding whether to continue with salmon farming at Sandsvág. On January 2, 2017, the two major insurance companies in the Faroe Islands reported that they had received approximately 2,400 claims for damages due to the Christmas hurricanes, which they estimated to cost around 45-50 million Danish kroner. Tryggingarfelagið Føroyar had received 1,700 claims, which they estimated would cost 30 million kroner, while Trygd had received 700 claims, which they estimated would cost 15-20 million kroner. However, it was too early to say exactly how extensive the damages were. By January 16, 2017, the number of damages from the Christmas hurricanes in the Faroe Islands had risen to 3,000 and was estimated to cost insurance companies 75 million kroner. The largest and most expensive damage occurred when a commercial building in Kambsdalur was torn from its foundation and blown away. Tryggingarfelagið Føroyar received a total of 2,335 claims for damages, which were estimated to cost between 40 and 45 million kroner, while the insurance company Trygd received a total of 1,011 claims for storm damages, which were estimated to cost over 30 million kroner to compensate."

Vicente struck the Pearl River Estuary at peak intensity, becoming the most notable typhoon disaster in the region in over a decade. It prompted the Hong Kong Observatory to issue its first No. 10 Hurricane Signal in nearly 13 years and led the Macau Meteorological Bureau to hoist the No. 9 Signal, also for the first time in nearly 13 years. Since Vicente was closer to Macau, the decision of the Macau Meteorological Bureau not to hoist the No. 10 Signal sparked widespread controversy. In Hong Kong, the storm also led to a major uproar over a plastic pellet spill incident that was only revealed 10 days after the typhoon."

However, the Hong Kong Observatory did not issue a \"Special Weather Alert,\" handling it differently compared to tropical cyclones Talim and Doksuri earlier that year. At 3:40 PM that day, the Observatory issued the No. 1 Standby Signal, with Vicente located about 540 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. The Observatory stated that Vicente's organization was \"relatively loose\" at the time and that it was still some distance away from Hong Kong, making it unlikely to issue the No. 3 Signal that evening, though it would consider doing so the next day. \n\nUnder the combined influence of an anticyclone over southern China and Vicente's subsiding air currents, Hong Kong experienced hot and hazy weather that day, with temperatures in most areas rising to 34 degrees Celsius or above, and some areas recording highs of 37 degrees Celsius. The Very Hot Weather Warning was in effect until 7:45 PM. The hot weather also triggered convective rain, with a strong thunderstorm area forming in eastern Guangdong and crossing Hong Kong at sunset, bringing thunderstorms to the region. The Observatory issued the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal at 5:35 PM, which remained in effect until 6:40 PM. As the thunderstorm area passed through Hong Kong, it brought brief strong gusts, with sustained wind speeds temporarily surging. Sai Kung, Kai Tak, and Cheung Chau recorded brief strong winds. However, as the thunderstorm area weakened suddenly while crossing Hong Kong, the heavy rain only brought 20 to 30 millimeters of rainfall to eastern Hong Kong, falling short of the Amber Rainstorm Warning standard. Only the eastern coast of Sai Kung experienced heavier rainfall, recording 40 millimeters. After the heavy rain, double rainbows appeared in some parts of Hong Kong. \n\nThe strong gusts brought by the rainstorm caused a scaffolding structure on Wang Chin Street in Kowloon Bay, near the MTR Shatin to Central Link International Mail Centre, to collapse entirely. Additionally, over a dozen people kayaking, rowing, and surfing fell into the sea, but fortunately, there were no casualties. \n\nOn July 22, Vicente continued to approach. The Observatory stated that it was unlikely to issue the No. 3 Signal in the morning but would consider doing so in the afternoon. Later, it revised its statement, saying it was unlikely to issue the No. 3 Signal in the afternoon but would consider doing so if Vicente moved closer or the winds strengthened. As Vicente's movement slowed and it stalled about 350 kilometers south-southeast of Hong Kong, the No. 1 Signal remained in effect throughout the day, and the Observatory did not issue the No. 3 Signal, postponing the decision to the morning of July 23. Following the earlier impact of Severe Tropical Storm Talim, the Observatory once again reminded parents to pay attention to storm updates before sending their children to school. \n\nThe weather in Hong Kong remained hot that day, with widespread areas recording maximum temperatures of 32 degrees Celsius or above. However, Vicente's outer rainbands also brought squally showers and occasional thunderstorms to Hong Kong."

The Observatory subsequently stated that the No. 3 Signal would be maintained during the day, and unless Vicente accelerated towards the coast of South China or further intensified, the chance of issuing the No. 8 Signal during the day was low. Winds in Hong Kong began to strengthen significantly in the morning, with strong northeasterly winds affecting widespread areas in the afternoon, and occasional gale-force winds affecting offshore and highland areas [11]. \n\nAs Vicente accelerated north to northwest-northwest, the Observatory announced at 11:45 a.m. that the No. 8 Signal might be issued around dusk. With Vicente rapidly intensifying into a typhoon, the Observatory issued a \"Special Weather Alert\" at 2:05 p.m., stating that Vicente would pass within 200 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong, and the Observatory would consider issuing the No. 8 Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. At this time, the weather in Hong Kong deteriorated rapidly, with squally showers and occasionally heavy rain. The Observatory issued a \"Special Report on Tropical Cyclones\" at 3:45 p.m., announcing that the No. 8 Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal was expected to be issued by 6 p.m. or earlier. After 4 p.m., Cheung Chau, one of the eight designated automatic weather stations in the Observatory's wind measurement network, began recording gale-force winds [12]. \n\nUnder the impact of strong winds, a giant tree over 20 meters tall collapsed in Siu Sai Wan, crushing a minibus [13]; in Central's Connaught Road Central, wooden boards were blown up by strong winds, injuring several pedestrians, one of whom was directly knocked unconscious by the boards."

After the No. 8 signal was issued, foreign objects were found on the tracks at MTR Ngau Tau Kok Station and Mong Kok East Station, but as train services had already been reduced to limited service, there were only slight delays without significant disruption. Additionally, Kowloon Motor Bus announced at 8:40 PM that all routes would be suspended, and Citybus and New World First Bus also announced the suspension of most services. Winds in Hong Kong rapidly and significantly strengthened, and shortly after nightfall, many areas were already affected by gale-force winds from the east to northeast, with signs of further intensification.\n\nAt 8:45 PM on the same day, the Observatory stated that Vicente had slightly intensified and was taking a more northwesterly path, coming closer to Hong Kong. It was expected that Vicente would pass about 100 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. The Observatory further indicated that if winds in Hong Kong strengthened further, it might need to issue a higher tropical cyclone warning signal, urging the public to stay updated on the latest storm information. At 11:20 PM, the Observatory issued the No. 9 Gale or Storm Signal, when Vicente was located about 110 kilometers south-southwest of Hong Kong and had rapidly intensified into a severe typhoon. This was the first No. 9 signal in three years since Typhoon Molave directly hit Hong Kong in 2009. The Observatory noted that \"in the past few hours, Vicente has rapidly intensified into a severe typhoon\" and stated that Vicente was still taking a northerly path, approaching Hong Kong, and would pass within 100 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. However, it did not mention whether the No. 10 Hurricane Signal would be issued. This was also the first time in the Observatory's history that the term \"rapidly intensified\" was used, and it marked Vicente as the first severe typhoon under the Observatory's new tropical cyclone classification system to trigger the issuance of the No. 8 or higher signal.\n\nWinds in Hong Kong further strengthened to storm force and shifted to blow from the east to southeast. In particular, wind speeds at Cheung Chau, Cheung Chau Beach, and Waglan Island exceeded 110 kilometers per hour, approaching hurricane force."

The incident originated from a tree collapse at Tai Po Market Station, which blocked the tracks and damaged cables, causing a power outage and an immediate paralysis of the East Rail Line. Even after repairs, services could not resume before the end of the operating hours. The Kwun Tong Line trains were also affected, with passengers causing a commotion at Choi Hung Station. Due to the power outage, some passengers were trapped on trains and had to spend the night in the carriages. Eight East Rail Line trains lost power, with one train experiencing a complete blackout in three carriages. Over a thousand passengers were affected, forced to stay overnight in train carriages and station halls. Meanwhile, other sections also experienced power trips, and power supply began to return to normal at 2:44 a.m. the next day, but by then, no trains were running. The MTR opened stations for passengers to rest, but passengers expressed strong dissatisfaction with the MTR's arrangements and criticized the lack of an earlier service suspension. The East Rail Line was paralyzed for nearly eight hours, and limited services were only restored south of Fo Tan Station at the scheduled first train departure time. Services north of Fo Tan Station remained suspended until 7:35 a.m. on July 24, when the fallen tree at Tai Po Market Station was cleared, allowing full service to resume."

Coupled with its increased movement speed of 20 kilometers per hour, it created a \"semi-circle effect,\" placing Hong Kong in its \"dangerous semi-circle.\" The automatic weather station at Cheung Chau Beach first recorded a maximum 10-minute average wind speed of 127 kilometers per hour at midnight, reaching hurricane levels. The main station at Cheung Chau also began intermittently recording hurricane-force winds after midnight, which later became sustained, with wind speeds surging to over 130 kilometers per hour. As the two near-sea-level automatic weather stations in Cheung Chau successively recorded hurricane-force winds, the Hong Kong Observatory issued the No. 10 Hurricane Signal at 12:45 a.m. on July 24 without prior notice. At that time, Vicente was centered about 100 kilometers southwest of the Hong Kong Observatory headquarters. This was the first No. 10 signal in nearly 13 years since Typhoon York struck Hong Kong in 1999, and the first \"issued\" rather than \"hoisted\" No. 10 signal since the closure of the Cheung Chau Signal Station. The Observatory stated that \"Vicente's eyewall was very close to the southwestern part of Hong Kong, bringing hurricane-force winds to the area; frequent squalls and heavy rain were also affecting Hong Kong,\" and urged residents not to leave sheltered areas and to closely monitor broadcasts regarding tropical cyclone warnings. The Observatory also issued a landslip warning at 1:10 a.m., a yellow rainstorm warning signal and a special report on flooding in the northern New Territories at 1:55 a.m., along with a thunderstorm warning issued at 12:15 a.m., resulting in five warnings being in effect simultaneously.

At 10:45 PM, the Observatory announced that Vicente's circulation no longer covered Hong Kong; under the combined influence of a high-pressure ridge over southeastern China and a broad monsoon trough, offshore and highland areas were still affected by strong winds. Finally, at 11:15 PM, the Observatory canceled all tropical cyclone warning signals, with Vicente located approximately 600 kilometers west-northwest of Hong Kong at that time.

During the effective period of the Strong Monsoon Signal, winds in Cheung Chau remained at strong levels, and Sai Kung also recorded brief strong winds. Over the next two to three days, Hong Kong was intermittently affected by heavy rain due to the combined influence of Vicente's residual rainbands and the broad monsoon trough, with the Observatory issuing multiple Amber Rainstorm Warnings. By July 28, Vicente's residual low-pressure area and the broad monsoon trough dissipated, and a high-pressure ridge over southeastern China extended to the Guangdong coast, leading to gradually improving weather. \n\nThe Observatory issued a press release on the day after Vicente dissipated (July 26, 2012), describing the rapid intensification of Vicente from a tropical storm to a severe typhoon within two days as \"unprecedented\" among tropical cyclones for which the No. 10 signal was issued.

Both the No. 3 and No. 8 signals met the criteria. The measured wind speeds in many parts of Hong Kong were the highest since Typhoon York in 1999, with wind speed data from many automatic weather stations approaching records set by Severe Tropical Storm Becky in 1993 and Typhoon Ellen in 1983. Some automatic weather stations established in recent years even recorded record-breaking wind speeds. Based on the eight automatic weather stations in the revised tropical cyclone warning system of 2013, with Lau Fau Shan replacing Wetland Park, five stations recorded gale-force winds. This was the second time since the adoption of this wind measurement network that two stations recorded storm-force winds, the fourth time that widespread strong winds were recorded, and the fourth time the No. 8 signal met the criteria. The airport recorded a 10-minute average wind speed of 96 km/h, tying the record set during Typhoon York in 1999. Cheung Chau even recorded hurricane-force winds, marking the first time since the adoption of the wind measurement network in 2007 that a reference automatic weather station recorded hurricane-force winds. Except for the failures at Stanley Wong Ma Kok and Tap Mun stations, all automatic weather stations across Hong Kong recorded strong winds or higher, an unprecedented occurrence since the Observatory launched the \"One District, One Station\" initiative in 2007, which ensured at least one automatic weather station in each of Hong Kong's 18 districts, doubling the number of stations. During the storm, the highest 10-minute average wind speeds recorded at Cheung Chau, the airport, Kai Tak, Sai Kung, Tsing Yi, Wetland Park, Ta Kwu Ling, and Sha Tin were 140, 96, 85, 83, 52, 50, 47, and 47 km/h, respectively. In the southwestern regions of Hong Kong, offshore areas, and highlands, hurricane-force winds persisted, with Cheung Chau recording the highest 10-minute average wind speed of 140 km/h, the highest since Typhoon Ellen in 1983. The Cheung Chau Beach automatic weather station, operational since Typhoon Koppu in 2009, recorded a record-breaking 10-minute average wind speed of 127 km/h. Additionally, the exposed and elevated Ngong Ping recorded a 10-minute average wind speed of 197 km/h and a maximum gust exceeding 250 km/h before the anemometer malfunctioned. According to the Observatory's Vicente report, Ngong Ping recorded a maximum gust of 256 km/h. In Victoria Harbour, the automatic weather station at the Kowloon Star Ferry Pier recorded a 10-minute average wind speed of 87 km/h, approaching storm-force levels, with the highest hourly average wind speed reaching 83 km/h, both records being the highest since Typhoon Ellen in 1983. The Kai Tak automatic weather station recorded a 10-minute average wind speed of 85 km/h and a maximum hourly average wind speed of 70 km/h, the highest since Severe Tropical Storm Becky in 1993. Additionally, a weather enthusiast \"chased the wind\" at the Hung Hom Pier, where their anemometer recorded storm-force average wind speeds and gusts reaching hurricane-force levels of 152 km/h. Due to the exposure to easterly winds, Hung Hom Pier is a popular spot for weather enthusiasts to measure wind speeds."

The Meteorological Bureau was accused of being \"a step behind\" Hong Kong, leading to a decline in its credibility. Additionally, the warning time was only slightly more than one hour, coinciding with the busy rush hour, causing traffic paralysis in Macau. Traffic jams occurred across all districts in Macau for several hours, with residents taking three times longer than usual to get home. Macau Legislative Assembly member Lam Heong Sang criticized the untimely forecast and lack of consideration for the public, suggesting that the authorities extend the warning time to two hours or more (in line with the Hong Kong Observatory's \"Special Tropical Cyclone Warning Bulletin\"). Crisis teams from various departments were also criticized for acting independently, resulting in low response efficiency and a complete failure of the emergency mechanism. Many areas in the city reportedly had no traffic police on duty, leaving no one to direct traffic, and some vehicles took the opportunity to drive against traffic, creating dangerous situations.

Macau's three bridges recorded a one-minute average wind speed exceeding 118 km/h starting at 1 a.m., and subsequent reports showed that the average wind speed over the past hour at 2 a.m. reached level 11, highlighting the delay in hoisting the No. 9 signal. Many netizens in discussion forums criticized the Meteorological Bureau for dereliction of duty, demanding the resignation of Director Fong Soi-kuan. Hong Kong netizens joined the discussion, accusing the Macau Meteorological Bureau of \"not hoisting the No. 10 signal when it should, and hoisting it when it shouldn't,\" mocking that during Fong Soi-kuan's tenure, there was no need to hoist the No. 10 signal because \"it would take over a decade or even 20 years to encounter a typhoon eye passing through,\" thereby criticizing Macau's stricter criteria for the highest typhoon signal compared to Hong Kong, which only requires hurricane-level winds recorded at any sea-level location within its territory.\n\nSeveral members of Macau's Islands Community Advisory Committee also criticized the Meteorological Bureau for misjudgment, pointing out that the typhoon's path suggested Macau should have been more affected than Hong Kong, forming a stark contrast with the Hong Kong Observatory's issuance of the No. 10 hurricane signal. They questioned the standards used by the Meteorological Bureau to determine typhoon signals and urged a review of the tropical cyclone warning mechanism. Director Fong Soi-kuan responded that the standards for hoisting the No. 10 signal in Macau and Hong Kong are different. In Macau, in addition to an average wind speed of 118 km/h, the typhoon center must also pass through Macau. The highest recorded average wind speed this time was 115.2 km/h, which falls within the range of the No. 8 signal. The No. 9 signal was hoisted due to the severe impact caused by Vicente's approach, but the conditions for hoisting the No. 10 signal were not met.\n\nLater, Director Fong Soi-kuan explained, along with unofficial analyses, that generally, the closer Macau is to a tropical cyclone, the stronger the local winds. However, unlike Hong Kong, Macau was not affected by continuous strong rainbands, which could have further intensified the winds through downbursts accompanied by heavy rain. Additionally, Vicente's eyewall had a gap, and when it was closest to Macau, this gap rotated over Macau, placing it between the eyewall and the stronger spiral rainbands. As a result, Macau did not experience the full impact of the eyewall, and the hurricane conditions within Macau were not as sustained as those in Hong Kong's Cheung Chau, leading to the discrepancy in signals between the two regions. Due to Hong Kong's larger area compared to Macau, the chance of recording hurricane-level winds at any sea-level location in Hong Kong is higher than in Macau, which also increases the likelihood of the Hong Kong Observatory issuing the highest signal compared to the Macau Meteorological Bureau. Some netizens also believed that the Meteorological Bureau had no intention of hoisting the No. 9 signal and only did so \"reluctantly\" when Vicente was just 50 km away from Macau and all three bridges recorded hurricane-level winds.\n\nEventually, five years later, Typhoon Hato forced the Meteorological Bureau to hoist the No. 10 signal, leading to Fong Soi-kuan stepping down and facing disciplinary action the following year. Subsequently, the Meteorological Bureau revised the criticized overly strict criteria for issuing the No. 10 signal, adopting a more lenient standard based on a 10-minute average wind speed and no longer requiring the typhoon center to pass over Macau."

                "content": "On January 5, 2017, a low-pressure area formed in the southeastern waters off Mindanao, Philippines. The United States Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the tropical disturbance number 96W, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the system's chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low\" at 2 PM the following day. At that time, the easterly flow of the subtropical ridge guided the system westward at a speed of about 15 kilometers per hour, approaching central Philippines. However, strong vertical wind shear suppressed its development, leaving the system loosely organized with an exposed low-level circulation center. Nevertheless, the abundant latent heat supplied by the waters of the Northwest Pacific allowed the system to develop slowly. As the system gradually consolidated and began to rotate on the 7th, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its rating to \"high\" at 8 AM and simultaneously issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 9 AM, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center followed suit at 5 AM on the 8th, assigning it the tropical cyclone number \"01W.\" The Hong Kong Observatory followed at 6:45 PM.\n\nComputer models consistently predicted that the low-pressure system would sweep across the Philippines and then move into the southern South China Sea, eventually making landfall in Vietnam. The system continued westward, approaching central Philippines, ultimately making landfall on Siargao Island. It then moved into a weak point of the subtropical ridge, becoming trapped in a saddle-shaped pressure field, which slowed its movement. Although the saddle field provided good low-level convergence, the terrain of the Philippines had a greater-than-expected impact on the system, cutting off its moisture supply for an extended period, causing signs of cloud dissipation. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning at 5 PM, and the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded the system back to a low-pressure area at 8 AM on the 10th. Its remnants later moved into the southern South China Sea via the Sulu Sea.\n\nThe system absorbed energy from the South China Sea and attempted to re-strengthen, successfully resisting strong vertical wind shear and gradually repairing its low-level circulation center, which also expanded significantly. The Japan Meteorological Agency reclassified it as a tropical depression at 2 AM on the 11th. However, as vertical wind shear increased, its intensity weakened, and its cloud clusters dissipated. The Japan Meteorological Agency subsequently downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 8 AM. Later, the system reorganized, and a more robust cloud cluster reappeared on satellite imagery. The Japan Meteorological Agency reclassified it as a tropical depression again at 4 PM. On the 12th, increased vertical wind shear caused the system's cloud bands to be significantly separated, leaving the low-level circulation center fully exposed and creating a convection void. By the 13th, convection erupted again around the low-level circulation center as the system attempted to repair itself, but there were no signs of the center being covered by cloud bands, and the low-level circulation center remained exposed. On the same day, the system became trapped in a saddle-shaped pressure field near Vietnam and slowly drifted northward. This was due to the subtropical ridge being unable to extend westward under the influence of another low-pressure area. Absorbing energy from the sea, the system strengthened again, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to assess its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"medium\" at 1 AM on January 14. The rating was further upgraded to \"high\" at 8:30 AM, and a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued simultaneously. By the 15th, decreasing wind shear created more favorable conditions for the system to absorb energy from the sea and repair its low-level circulation center. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reclassified it as a tropical depression at 9 AM. However, the strong winter monsoon moved southward on the 16th, weakening the system again, causing its cloud clusters to dissipate and convection to vanish. The system then made landfall in Dam Doi District, Ca Mau Province, Vietnam. After landfall, the system was disrupted by terrain, making its low-level circulation center difficult to identify. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning, and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 2 PM that day. Its remnants later moved into the Gulf of Thailand but failed to reorganize. The Hong Kong Observatory's isobaric weather chart at 2 AM on the 17th showed that the system had dissipated."

                "content": "The unusual storm began on December 13, 1951, and lasted until December 24, 1951. The strong winds (at speeds of up to 80 kilometers per hour) toppled and uprooted hundreds of tents and temporary housing structures in transit camps, felled thousands of trees, roof tiles, shutters, and billboards, and severed electricity and telephone lines across the country. In Tel Aviv alone, more than 2,000 telephone lines were damaged. Due to the flooding, buildings in older settlements were damaged and even collapsed, and transportation connections to dozens of settlements were cut off for an extended period. Roads were also blocked due to fallen trees. Thousands of residents were evacuated from their homes. In the first days of the storm, the Galilee, the central region, the Judean Hills, and Jerusalem were primarily affected. On December 18 and afterward, the storm severely impacted many settlements in the central region and Tel Aviv. In some places, between 5% and 20% of the average annual rainfall fell in a single day. The peak was in Rishon Lezion, where 174 millimeters of rain fell on December 20. By December 24, the amount of rain in Rehovot and Lod exceeded the annual average: in Rehovot - 562 millimeters (annual average 495) and in Lod 513 millimeters (annual average 505). In Tel Aviv, 12 consecutive days of rain until December 24 brought an amount of rain equivalent to 75% of the city's average annual rainfall."

                "content": "The storm's impact was particularly severe on dozens of transit camps across the country because their residents lived in tents and various lightweight structures that were not built to withstand the strength of the winds. The drainage infrastructure in the camps was also far from sufficient. The wind uprooted tents, blew away tin shacks, and even overturned huts. Residents of the tents and structures that were lost lost a significant portion of their belongings. It was necessary to evacuate thousands of families from the camps who had lost their homes. They were housed in public buildings in established settlements. Hundreds of children from the camps were transferred for the winter to cooperative agricultural settlements. Hundreds were absorbed into youth immigration institutions. In the northern region, the Tzemach and Osherat transit camps were affected, with part of Osherat flooded and its residents moved to Nahariya. From the Nahariya transit camp, 400 families were evacuated. On December 21, the Nahariya transit camp was flooded again after its residents had already returned to it. In Haifa and its surroundings, the Neve David, Kiryat Amal, and Tira transit camps were affected, with a strong water flow hitting Tira on the 20th of the month. Some of their residents were evacuated to public buildings and nearby settlements. From the Tira transit camp alone, 200 families were evacuated. In the central region, many transit camps were affected, including Agrobank, Beit Lid, Netanya, Jalil (near Herzliya), Petah Tikva, Hiriya, Bnei Brak, Sakiya B, Holon, Rishon Lezion, and Rehovot. Transit camps established in low-lying areas particularly suffered from severe flooding. Thus, on December 20, the Rishon Lezion transit camp, established within a stream channel, was severely affected. On the same day, the Petah Tikva transit camp turned into a water lake. About 2,000 residents were moved from it to public buildings in Petah Tikva. The Hiriya and Rehovot transit camps were completely flooded. After the flooding on the 20th of the month, about 1,300 residents were evacuated from Hiriya to Tel Aviv, and about 1,000 were moved to Ramat Gan. In Jerusalem and its surroundings, at least seven transit camps were affected, including Talpiot, Mekor Haim, Nes Harim, Aminadav, and Qatra (near the Staf). The road to the Alar and Dir al-Hawa transit camps in the Jerusalem corridor was blocked on December 13, and since then, there was no connection between them and the outside world, with their residents subsisting on emergency food rations. On December 16, jeeps carrying food supplies set out for them, but they sank in the mud, and only the next day did their cargo reach the camps on foot. The road to the Mekor Haim transit camp was disrupted for about ten days due to road flooding, and food supplies were brought to it by mules. On December 23, several temporary structures in the Talpiot transit camp collapsed. On December 17, it was reported that by that day, 900 out of 11,000 tents in the transit camps had been severely damaged. On December 24, the Jewish Agency, which was responsible for the transit camps, announced that about 5,000 people had been evacuated from them during the storm, and another 7,000 children had been evacuated and housed in cooperative agricultural settlements, youth immigration institutions, and women's organizations. On the same day, hundreds of transit camp residents returned to their homes."

On December 20, hundreds of volunteers, including workers from the Histadrut and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to work in the transit camps. Dozens of Histadrut buildings were made available to the evacuated residents of the camps. Assistance efforts in the transit camps intensified on December 22 after the weather improved. It was decided to delay the return of residents to the camps as a precaution. Some were relocated to schools, where classes were therefore not held. About a thousand volunteers from Tel Aviv went on December 23 to nearby transit camps to provide assistance. Among them were workers from the Jewish Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maccabi, women's organizations, youth organizations, the inter-kibbutz seminar, and other institutions. Members of Kibbutz Givat Brenner worked overnight to transfer 200 children from the nearby transit camp to the kibbutz. In Kfar Saba, local residents went out to assist with repairs in the neighboring transit camp. A plan to house children from the Qatra transit camp near Jerusalem (now Even Sapir) in the nearby Monastery of St. John in the Wilderness was canceled at the last moment due to concerns about the reaction of religious parties, and the children were transferred to Kiryat Anavim the following day. On December 24, work groups went out to carry out repairs in the transit camps of Petah Tikva, Saqiya, Hiriya, Givat Brenner, Rehovot, Rishon Lezion, Magdiel, and Kfar Ono. The residents of the transit camps protested against the harsh living conditions they were forced to endure. On December 24, about a thousand transit camp residents demonstrated in front of the Jewish Agency offices in Tel Aviv to protest the living conditions in the camps. The police arrived at the scene to secure the offices. In at least one incident, on December 15, transit camp residents threw stones at cars in Emek Hefer. In one of the camps, the camp manager was beaten by residents."

The kibbutzim Amir, Kfar Blum, and Sde Nehemia faced the threat of flooding after the drainage canals dug in the valley failed the test. The water flow in the Hula area rose to 120 cubic meters per hour - four times the normal rate. The storm burdened ships sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. On December 14, a Turkish cargo ship sank near the port of Haifa. At least two of its crew members perished. In the northern coastal plain and the Haifa Bay area, very large areas were flooded. Kibbutz Ein HaMifratz was flooded, as well as an area in the moshav Bustan HaGalil. Damage was caused to fruit orchards and vegetable fields. Train traffic between Haifa and Nahariya was disrupted. Work at the Haifa port was halted on December 18 due to the storm. On the same day, water flooded basements and sites near the coast in Haifa, including municipal facilities. The areas of Shal Bridge and Hof Shemen were particularly affected. Houses were flooded in the neighborhoods of Wadi Rushmiya, Halisa, and Arad al-Raml. In some places, water accumulated to a height of one meter. Urgent pumping and drainage operations were required. During the night between December 18 and 19, firefighters and municipal workers responded to dozens of calls for help due to the flooding. The Haifa-Acre road was flooded by the overflow of the Naaman River. The road to Tel Aviv was also flooded near Atlit and was temporarily closed to traffic."

On December 24, transportation between Petah Tikva, Ramat Gan, and Rosh HaAyin was cut off. The largest flooded area in Petah Tikva was in the legendary Paja neighborhood. In Rishon LeZion, several houses faced the risk of collapse due to the flooding. The road to the village of Betania near Ashdod was cut off by water on the 21st of the month, and it was necessary to send planes to drop food supplies to its residents."

The river first overflowed on December 15, flooding several streets in the city. It overflowed again on the night between December 20 and 21, flooding fields and streets. The neighborhoods adjacent to the river—Hatikva, Ezra, Shapira, Montefiore, Nahalat Yitzhak—were flooded and cut off from the rest of the city. The water flooded basements, stairwells, and apartments on the lower floors of buildings. Hundreds of families were evacuated during the night, and some residents had to flee their homes to avoid drowning. The water level in the Montefiore neighborhood reached over a meter, requiring the use of boats from the Tel Aviv port and the navy to evacuate residents. Rescuers operated in the flooded neighborhoods with dedication, even risking their own lives. On the night of December 20, the neighborhoods of Nouzha, Sakhnat Darwish, and Givat Aliya in Jaffa were also affected. Hundreds of residents were evacuated from dilapidated buildings in Jaffa to public buildings. The Tel Aviv municipality provided clothing and food to the evacuees, and donations were collected from the public for this purpose. On the morning of December 21, the situation in Tel Aviv worsened further: the area from Sarona to the Gali Gil pool turned into a lake, and several cars and buses were stranded and flooded. The city center was also flooded, and transportation there was severely disrupted. The bridges over the Ayalon River and the Yarkon River, as well as buildings in the exhibition grounds, were flooded. That morning, all transportation routes to Tel Aviv were cut off except for the road to Jerusalem. Hundreds of cars in the city were damaged by rainwater intrusion. Hundreds of telephone lines were out of service due to water damage. School classes were canceled. Residents of the flooded neighborhoods in Tel Aviv returned to their homes on the 22nd of the month and found extensive destruction after the water rose to a height of a meter or more. In many homes, all the contents were ruined. On the night between December 23 and 24, the Musrara River overflowed its banks for the third time. The neighborhoods adjacent to the river were flooded again. Those who had already returned to their homes there had to evacuate once more. Six hundred people were evacuated from the neighborhoods during the night, some by boats, and were housed in schools. The Yarkon River did not overflow its banks. Some access roads to and from Tel Aviv, including to Ramat Gan, Netanya, and Rishon Lezion, as well as the railway line to Haifa, were blocked by water. In the large area of Jaffa, a two-story building collapsed. Damage was caused to the Sarona Bridge, La Guardia Bridge, and the Hatikva neighborhood bridge. On the morning of December 24, the water level in the Musrara River began to recede, and the storm subsided significantly. The damage caused by the flooding to the neighborhoods of Tel Aviv was estimated at half a million liras. An inspection of the houses in the flooded neighborhoods found that ten houses needed to be demolished immediately, and repairs were required in dozens of other houses before they could be used for living again. Many residents of the flooded neighborhoods lost all their belongings. On the morning of December 27, about 1,300 residents of the neighborhoods who could not yet return to their damaged homes were still under the care of the municipality. Hosting the evacuees in schools in Tel Aviv made it difficult to resume classes, so they were concentrated in three schools to allow classes to resume in the others."

Train traffic to the city was also disrupted. On December 18, roads to most settlements in the western Negev were flooded. The road at the entrance to Be'er Sheva collapsed. The Wadi Be'er Sheva bridge was flooded with water at a level of half a meter above the road bridge. The Tel Aviv-Be'er Sheva road was flooded near Ekron (today - Mazkeret Batya) on December 19."

It was also reported that an elderly man was injured when a garage roof was torn off by the strong winds, and that 60,000 households lost power. The storm then moved over Sweden's west coast and Skåne on September 21, 2018, and SMHI issued Class 2 warnings for all of southern Sweden. At Väderöarna, a maximum wind speed of 32.8 m/s in gusts was measured, which is just above hurricane strength. There were subsequent reports of repeated power outages, fallen trees, and traffic problems. The storm's progression was calmer than expected, and during the night of September 22, all Class 2 warnings, except in Bohuslän, were downgraded to Class 1 with 21-24 m/s, meaning the weather was no longer classified as a storm."

The highest average wind speed during the storm – the highest ever recorded in Finland – was measured at Kökar at 32.5 m/s, and the strongest gust exceeded 40 m/s. Electricity was cut off for over 100,000 households, mainly in Southwest Finland.[2] The power outages also caused disruptions in mobile networks.

The highest average wind speed during the storm – the highest ever recorded in Finland – was measured at Kökar at 32.5 m/s, and the strongest gust exceeded 40 m/s. Electricity was cut off for over 100,000 households, mainly in Southwest Finland. Power outages also caused disruptions in mobile networks. In Denmark, Aapeli's sister storm threw the cargo of a freight train onto a passenger train on the railway bridge crossing the Great Belt. Eight passengers on the passenger train lost their lives in the accident."

It had sustained winds at storm strength in Thisted and strong storm conditions throughout West Jutland and Vendsyssel. Several ferries and trains were canceled. In Southern Jutland, a number of trees were uprooted, and the water level on Fanø rose significantly, causing several cars to be flooded. A number of beach houses in Blokhus were overturned."

One of the most symbolic effects of that day was the heavy downpour that severely damaged the surroundings of the Montserrat Monastery, where more than 100 liters per square meter fell in just 45 minutes. The location of the abbey near the stream caused much of the facilities to be flooded with water and soil. Additionally, other corners of the massif suddenly changed their appearance, such as some channels. In this episode, 5 people lost their lives."

The storm then moved over Sweden's west coast and Skåne on September 21, 2018, and SMHI issued Class 2 warnings for all of southern Sweden. At Väderöarna, a maximum wind speed of 32.8 m/s in gusts was measured, which is just above hurricane strength. Reports then followed of repeated power outages, fallen trees, and traffic problems. The storm's progression was calmer than expected, and during the night of September 22, all Class 2 warnings, except in Bohuslän, were downgraded to Class 1 with 21-24 m/s, meaning the weather was no longer classified as a storm."

The storm moved roughly northward from Northern France at a speed of about eighty kilometers per hour over Belgium and the Netherlands to Northern Germany. It resulted in numerous collapsed buildings, many casualties, and a disrupted social life. The greatest damage occurred in the city of Utrecht. There, downbursts (gustnadoes) caused enormous devastation. A bow echo is also said to have occurred."

The nave of this church collapsed. Towers of four other church buildings also collapsed: the Sint-Jacobskerk (now Jacobikerk), Sint-Nicolaaskerk (now Nicolaikerk), Buurkerk, Pieterskerk, and Agnietenkerk. Other damaged structures included houses and several windmills. Trees were damaged or blown over, and many people lost their lives due to collapses. Based on the size of the hailstones that fell during the storm, the storm of 1674 appears to be one that occurs once every 1,000 to 10,000 years. Some saw the disaster as God's punishment for the Catholic arrangement of the church during the French occupation. Shortly after the disaster, Herman Saftleven was commissioned by the Utrecht city council to create a series of detailed drawings of the devastating downbursts and their consequences. The following report appeared in the Oprechte Haerlemse Saterdaegse Courant: \"Utrecht, August 2. Yesterday evening at half past seven, a terrible storm arose here, lasting until half past eight; but the worst occurred within a quarter of an hour: the sky was continuously lit and aflame, and it was terrifying to hear the thunder and dreadful winds, accompanied by the collapse of chimneys, roofs, facades, and towers, which brought an uncommon astonishment to everyone, and caused many to speak of an earthquake: the church of the Dom up to the choir lay with pillars and all underfoot as a heap of rubble by half past seven, without the Dom Tower being damaged in any way [...] In the immediate vicinity of the city of Utrecht, various places were also affected; in Vleuten, Jutphaas, Bunnik, Houten, and IJsselstein, church towers collapsed. In other areas of present-day Netherlands, churches collapsed due to the storm in places such as Asperen, Hellouw, Hippolytushoef, and Den Ilp. On a large scale, houses were destroyed in Hilversum and Landsmeer. In places such as Amsterdam, ships broke loose or sank. There was also significant damage in North Holland up to Texel."

The storm has been described as being locally even stronger than the Tapani storm that raged in December 2011. During the storm, the strongest gust measured on land was 29.8 m/s, recorded at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. At sea, the strongest gust was measured in Rauma, with a speed of 36.8 m/s. The highest average wind speed at sea, 30.7 m/s, was recorded in Kaskinen, matching the existing record for average wind speed. An average wind speed of about 31 m/s has now been recorded in Finland four times (30.5–31.4 m/s). The waves during the Seija storm were severe in Finnish sea areas, especially in the Bothnian Sea, where the significant wave height was nearly 6 meters. Sea levels also rose high on the west coast and in the eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland. The storm cut power to over 200,000 households, the same number as during the Tapani and Eino storms. The highest number of power outages occurred in Southwest Finland, where about 86,000 households were without electricity. The railway network also suffered damage, with four tracks blocked due to fallen trees. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the storm destroyed forests worth an estimated 15–60 million euros. Rescue services were called 1,040 times for damage control tasks due to the storm. During the Seija storm, up to 20 centimeters of snow fell in Kainuu, parts of Northern Ostrobothnia, and Southern Lapland, which, combined with strong winds, increased the number of power outages, especially in southern parts of Kainuu."

At 2 p.m. on June 18, the Central Weather Bureau recorded its central minimum pressure as 1004 hPa. At 10 p.m. on the same day, the Hong Kong Observatory upgraded it to a tropical depression and recorded a central minimum pressure of 1002 hPa. On June 19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center briefly upgraded it to a tropical storm but downgraded it back to a tropical depression later that day. On June 20, as the storm approached Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued the second tropical cyclone warning signal of the year. On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center again briefly upgraded it to a tropical storm but downgraded it six hours later. \n\nAt 3 p.m. on June 21, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Haima. That afternoon, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau also upgraded it to a mild typhoon, and the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau upgraded it to a tropical storm. At 9 p.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency reported a minimum pressure of 994 hPa. At 10 a.m. on June 22, the Hong Kong Observatory upgraded it to a tropical storm. By 1 p.m., the Hong Kong Observatory recorded a wind speed of 75 km/h and a minimum pressure of 985 hPa. That evening, the Hong Kong Observatory recorded a maximum wind speed of 85 km/h, but it remained stationary for several hours. \n\nOn the morning of June 23, Haima made landfall in western Guangdong. At 8 p.m. that day, the Central Weather Bureau recorded Haima's central minimum pressure weakening to 990 hPa, but it remained a mild typhoon. At 10:10 a.m. that morning, Haima made landfall in the area between Yangxi and Dianbai. Two hours later, influenced by Mirinae, it returned to the sea and made landfall again in Wuchuan City at 4:50 p.m. \n\nOn the morning of June 24, the Central Weather Bureau predicted that Haima would weaken to a tropical depression within 48 hours, but it remained a mild typhoon. Later that day, its center moved away from Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula, heading toward Vietnam. That morning, its center was still in the Beibu Gulf. At 2 p.m., the Central Weather Bureau recorded Haima's central minimum pressure rising to 992 hPa, but it remained a mild typhoon. That evening, the Central Weather Bureau recorded Haima's central minimum pressure dropping again to 988 hPa. \n\nAt 2 a.m. on June 25, Haima made landfall in Vietnam, still as a mild typhoon. By 8 a.m., it had weakened to a tropical depression. By that evening, it had further weakened into a low-pressure area."

The Hong Kong Observatory stated that it would consider issuing a tropical cyclone warning signal on the evening of June 20. At 9:35 PM on the same day, the Observatory issued the No. 1 Standby Signal, with Haima located about 420 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. On June 21, the Observatory indicated that Haima would maintain some distance from Hong Kong during the day and would consider whether to issue the No. 3 Signal from the evening of the same day to the morning of June 22. \n\nAt 5:45 AM on June 22, the Observatory issued the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal, with Haima located about 330 kilometers south of Hong Kong. That morning, winds in Hong Kong strengthened, with strong easterly to northeasterly winds affecting many areas, including Victoria Harbour. By the evening, widespread areas of Hong Kong experienced strong southeasterly winds, with gale-force winds in offshore waters and high ground. The Observatory stated that unless Haima significantly intensified or took a more northerly route, the chances of issuing a higher warning signal were low. At 8 PM, Haima was closest to Hong Kong, passing about 240 kilometers southwest of the city.\n\nAs Haima continued to move west-northwest and gradually moved away on June 23, winds in Hong Kong weakened. At 10:25 AM, the Observatory replaced the No. 3 Signal with the No. 1 Standby Signal, with Haima located about 310 kilometers west-southwest of Hong Kong. Due to the influence of the subtropical ridge, offshore winds continued to reach strong wind levels, and the Observatory did not cancel all tropical cyclone warning signals until 8:45 PM, when Haima was about 450 kilometers west-southwest of Hong Kong.\n\nDuring the storm, four of the eight designated automatic weather stations in the Observatory's wind measurement network recorded strong winds, with one station even recording gale-force winds, meeting the criteria for the No. 3 Signal. Cheung Chau, the airport, Sai Kung, and Kai Tak recorded maximum 10-minute average wind speeds of 84, 59, 53, and 49 kilometers per hour, respectively.\n\nSubsequently, the Observatory published an article titled \"Using Aircraft to Collect Tropical Cyclone Data\" in its \"Observatory Newsletter,\" stating that during Haima's approach to Hong Kong, it collaborated with the Government Flying Service for the first time. Senior pilot Leung Man-chiu of the Flying Service piloted a Jetstream-41 fixed-wing aircraft equipped with meteorological instruments to approach Haima's center and collect meteorological data. Since then, the Observatory has collaborated with the Flying Service multiple times for this mission, including during the approach of Severe Typhoon Vicente in 2012, which brought the No. 10 Signal to Hong Kong."

At 10:22 p.m., a tropical depression was located 440 kilometers east-southeast of Macao, moving westward at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour. On June 22, at 12:30 p.m., the No. 3 typhoon signal was hoisted, and all typhoon signals were canceled at 4:15 p.m. on June 23. During this period, classes for kindergarten and special education were suspended. On the morning of June 23, \"Haima\" was moving west-northwest at a speed of about 18 kilometers per hour, approximately 230 kilometers west-southwest of Macao, and was moving away from Macao. However, the No. 3 typhoon signal remained in effect for some time until the wind in Macao significantly weakened. At 12:47 p.m., \"Haima\" made landfall in Yangjiang, Guangdong. The Meteorological Bureau stated that the typhoon signal might be canceled in the afternoon, and at 4:15 p.m. that day, all typhoon signals were canceled. At 4:50 p.m. on the same day, a rainstorm warning signal was issued, which was canceled at 6:10 p.m. On June 22, the hourly average wind speeds recorded at Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge, Friendship Bridge North Peak, Friendship Bridge South Peak, and Sai Van Bridge were 69.3, 70.6, 72.3, and 69.2 km/h, respectively, with the highest gust reaching 102.2 km/h at one point. This indicated that the Meteorological Bureau's decision not to hoist the No. 8 typhoon signal was incorrect, and it also became the strongest No. 3 typhoon signal on record."

However, due to the influence of its outer circulation, rainfall continued in the southern and southeastern mountainous areas of Taiwan until the heavy rain advisory was lifted.  \nAs Haima gradually moved away from Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau downgraded the heavy rain advisory to a rain advisory and continued to issue it until the evening of June 22."

In Munich, however, it had already weakened and only led to a cooling without precipitation. The next day, a moist but not too warm layer of air extended up to an altitude of 2200 meters, with tropical warm air above it. Even higher up, the air cooled significantly. Due to a low-pressure system coming from the west, the moist air began to rise, facilitated by strong solar radiation and the release of condensation enthalpy, leading to the formation of cumulus clouds."

The intensifying thunderstorm cluster moved northeast, causing damage to cars and houses around 7 p.m. in the Landsberg am Lech area and reached the western part of Munich shortly before 8 p.m. Likely intensified by warm, moist air over the lakes (Ammersee and Starnberger See) near the city and extremely hot air over the city itself, the hailstorm caused significant damage in the southeastern parts of Munich (especially in the districts of Trudering and Riem) and the neighboring communities of Haar, Vaterstetten, and Grasbrunn. The northern part was hardly affected; for example, the Olympic Stadium's tent roof was not damaged. The slowly weakening storm moved further east over the northern district of Ebersberg, with Anzing being particularly hit by hailstones as large as tennis balls. It then moved along the German-Austrian border toward the Czech Republic. The entire path of the cell was extremely long, about 300 km. In Munich, the hailstorm lasted between 20 and 30 minutes, with the entire storm over the city lasting about two and a half hours. The largest confirmed hailstone had a diameter of 9.5 cm and a weight of about 300 g. However, it is likely that even larger stones fell. The storm left a hail layer up to 20 cm high, which only melted the next day. Fire departments had to handle over 3,800 operations."

The Munich tram had to suspend operations on several lines because overhead lines were damaged or switches were blocked. In addition, the hail destroyed the crops of various agricultural areas and disrupted traffic. The storm caused total damage of 3 billion DM, of which only 1.5 billion was insured.

For comparison: Maastricht recorded an hourly average of 14 m/s. Just after 3:00 PM, wind force nine (storm) was officially observed by the measuring stations in Vlissingen and Hoek van Holland, and shortly thereafter also by IJmuiden. Then the wind force increased significantly. Around 5:30 PM, the core of the depression passed over Vlieland.

Thus, the last hurricane of the 1999 season occurred in November in the Caribbean, as mentioned in the report of the National Hurricane Center, the regional meteorological center specialized by the World Meteorological Organization for monitoring tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic. The mention of hurricanes referred by analogy only to the wind force according to the Beaufort scale."

At the end of that month, two other storms followed one another less than two days apart and were considered by the media as the storm of the century in Europe. The first, Lothar, was a compact depression that passed quickly without changing the zonal flow of atmospheric circulation, which allowed the next one, Martin, to follow closely. The latter storm, being of large diameter, was associated with a modification of the circulation that prevented other depressions from following it. These storms have two points in common:"

Moving from west to east along an approximate line near the forty-ninth parallel, this depression reached Finistère at around 2 a.m. and Strasbourg at 11 a.m., traveling at an average speed of 100 km/h. The most violent winds ravaged a strip about 150 km wide along a curve starting from the tip of Brittany, passing through Normandy, Île-de-France, Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine, and Alsace. Lothar continued its path toward Germany, causing significant damage to infrastructure and forests such as the Black Forest. It caused unprecedented damage to forests in France, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark. Mountain winds reached speeds of 259 km/h. The depression formed off the coast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean in less than twenty-four hours. Exceptionally in Europe, the deepening of this storm intensified over land, reaching an atmospheric pressure of 960 hPa (960 mb), likely due to strong interaction with jet streams whose speed was around 400 km/h at just 9,000 meters altitude. According to a subsequent study by the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), the Austrian meteorological service, Lothar was followed by a secondary cyclogenesis trough that passed through Belgium and southwestern Germany, generating winds of over 90 km/h."

It developed off the coast of Brittany on December 27, reaching the region's coast around 4 p.m., before moving towards Nantes (7 p.m.), Romorantin (10 p.m.), Dijon (1 a.m. on December 28), and Alsace (4 a.m.). The regions most severely affected by the wind were Brittany, the Atlantic coast, particularly Charente-Maritime and Charente (198 km/h on Île d'Oléron), and then all areas south of a La Rochelle - Mâcon line, including the Côte d'Azur (gusts of 160 km/h unofficially recorded in Cannes). The wind continued to blow in Corsica on the morning of Tuesday, December 28, causing strong waves on the western coast. The storm also affected Spain, western Switzerland, and northern Italy. North of the depression, a cold air injection caused snowfall sticking to the ground in northern Brittany and Normandy from the afternoon of the 27th. During the night, the snow reached northeastern France up to the Genevois, leaving flakes south of the Paris region. Meanwhile, significant amounts of rain caused flooding along its path. In some areas of the Alps, snowfall lasted two days, with the snow layer reaching about two meters."

In 1999, Météo-France was able to predict the occurrence of the two storms. Based on existing models and exceptional variations in measured temperatures and pressure, Météo-France was able to issue a severe weather warning 24 hours before the Lothar storm. Météo-France forecasters at all levels work closely with Civil Security services. On December 26 at 5:25 a.m., the Interministerial Crisis Management Operations Center (COGIC) of the Directorate of Civil Defense and Security (DDSC) received a phone call from Météo-France announcing that strong winds were heading towards Île-de-France and the eastern, northern, and central parts of the country. This phone report was confirmed by the issuance of a meteorological alarm bulletin (BAM) at 6:45 a.m., confirming a phenomenon of strong winds averaging 80 km/h, with gusts of 120 km/h, potentially reaching 140 km/h locally. While the population was warned of an exceptional weather event, the strength of the gusts exceeded the forecasts. At 7:30 a.m., Météo-France announced an update to the BAM, reporting a windy episode that could last one to two hours in Île-de-France and the central region, with winds potentially reaching 140 km/h or even 160 km/h locally. At 8:15 a.m., Civil Security, at the request of Météo-France, prepared a press release to warn residents of the affected areas of the significant risks that the announced winds could generate. The press alert, initially relayed by the national bulletins of the Radio France group, came as the Lothar storm was already hitting Normandy. The short time between the alert issued by Météo-France and the occurrence of the storm did not allow for earlier communication to the population about the severity of the phenomenon. Furthermore, the alert was issued at the end of the night, the day after Christmas celebrations, a time when media are less followed, and populations are harder to mobilize."

Power outages affect 3.6 million households - or 10 million French people. Some departments are largely without electricity (Orne, Creuse, Corrèze, Haute-Vienne, Cantal, Lot-et-Garonne), and others entirely (Vosges, Charente-Maritime). Due to energy shortages and pollution affecting water distribution, 2.5 million residents must obtain water from stores. To restore its network, EDF relied on the help of about twenty countries, which provided personnel (1,500 technicians) and specialized equipment. A large part of the road network is impassable on Monday, December 27, including major routes such as the A10 motorway and National Route 10. Nearly 20,000 km of roads and forest trails providing access to massifs are damaged. Out of 32,000 km of railway tracks, 20,000 km are rendered unusable. The mobilization of 18,000 railway workers allows 95% of installations to be restored by December 31. Rail traffic returns to normal after a week. The costs of restoration and operational losses for SNCF amount to 510 million francs. Numerous flights are canceled, and some airports (Bordeaux-Mérignac, Clermont-Ferrand) are closed. Nearly one million subscribers are without landline telephone service due to fallen trees on overhead telephone lines and the rapid depletion of backup batteries in telephone exchanges and relay antennas. Nearly 3,500 mobile phone relay antennas (Itinéris, SFR, Bouygues Télécom) are out of service. The restoration of telephone networks cost approximately 1 billion francs for France Télécom, 100 million francs for SFR, and nearly 20 million for Bouygues Télécom. The near-identical reconstruction of France Télécom's telephone network will not be completed until April 2001."

                "content": "The forestry and agricultural damage is considerable, particularly in the timber sector. Hundreds of thousands of trees have been felled, with waterlogged soils contributing to their instability. The first estimate of this damage, carried out by the Regional Forest and Timber Services (SRFB), evaluates the volume of felled (windthrow) and broken (breakage) wood at 140 million cubic meters (with a margin of error of 30%, i.e., between 98 and 182 million). The most affected regions are Lorraine (29.5 million cubic meters), Aquitaine (27.7), and Limousin (16.3). The resistance of trees varied depending on species and geographical areas: poplars from the Garonne and oaks from the Adour resisted better than pines from Médoc and Douglas firs from Limousin, with mountains faring better than plains. A subsequent and more precise assessment of the damage raised the windthrow volume to 176 million cubic meters. The extent of the damage, partly linked to poor forestry management, led foresters to question the practices that had prevailed until then. While viticulture was relatively spared, market gardeners and horticulturists saw thousands of hectares of greenhouses destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of fruit trees were felled or damaged in southwestern France, notably plum trees in Lot-et-Garonne and walnut trees in Périgord. The reconstruction of these orchards took about fifteen years. However, the livestock sector suffered the most significant damage (drowned animals, damaged or destroyed buildings). Stocks of fodder and silage were waterlogged, and cows had to be milked manually due to a lack of electricity, leading to the loss of several million liters of milk. Power outages affected artificial incubators, freezers, and refrigeration facilities. Many food businesses relying on cold storage (supermarkets, restaurants, bakers, caterers) lost their entire stock during a period of high activity. Order and transport flows were disrupted, and the sector was affected by technical unemployment measures. On the Atlantic coast, the storm surge reached 40 to 60 cm, and 1.5 to 2 m in Charente-Maritime. A quarter of the oyster farming facilities in the Marennes-Oléron basin were completely destroyed. However, some sectors benefited from unexpected expenditures, such as construction, public works, producers of building materials, and DIY equipment manufacturers."

In 2000, the French Federation of Insurance Companies (FFSA) estimated the damages at 44.3 billion francs (6.75 billion euros), excluding deductibles, damages whose undeclared costs remained the responsibility of individuals and businesses, operating losses due to the temporary closure of factories, workshops, and shops, as well as the partial destruction of forest heritage. Compensation in France reached 7.5 billion euros under the \"storm\" guarantee and 275 million euros for floods. Half of the compensation was financed by reinsurers, while the rest was covered by the reserves of insurance companies and the Central Reinsurance Fund (CCR). Insurance companies were led to define stricter loss criteria, and reinsurance companies (Munich Re, Swiss Re, etc.) increased their rates by 5 to 30%. Faced with a significant decrease in the provisions of the Central Reinsurance Fund, public authorities significantly modified the surcharge rate for natural disasters, the deductibles applicable in the event of a claim, and the conditions of reinsurance. The financial burden on the state for the restoration of French forest heritage reached 2 billion francs in emergency aid in 2000, 12 billion in subsidized loans at 1.5%, 6 billion francs in subsidies over ten years for reconstruction, and 2 billion francs in \"storm\" amendments to state-region plan contracts."

At the level of defense and security zones, the implementation of rescue efforts included the use of the interregional civil security coordination centers (CIRCOSC), but several affected zones (Center-West, Center-East) did not have any. At the national level, the government activated the decision support operations center (COAD) of the Ministry of the Interior and the joint operations center (COIA) under the Chief of Defense Staff. The COAD organized the dispatch of reinforcement columns of firefighters from the SDIS of departments spared by the storm and the assembly of the Civil Security military units (UIISC) dispersed across various operational theaters (floods in Venezuela, the Erika shipwreck in Brittany). The army's intervention began quickly with the spontaneous engagement of units, initiated by corps commanders or base commanders, in the form of patrols aimed at ensuring the safety of people and the preliminary clearing of the road network. Within 48 hours, the COIA took over the coordination of army interventions in liaison with the military defense districts. Additionally, local initiatives attempted to compensate for the delayed arrival of rescue efforts in some isolated areas: creation of essential needs hubs at the cantonal level (Doubs, Charente-Maritime), visits to residents without means of contact by postal workers (Creuse), and a generator exchange program (Cantal)."

Its objective is to prepare teaching teams, staff, and children in educational facilities for crisis situations.

Hundreds of people lost their lives. The largest shipwreck was that of the German barque Wilhelmsburg on the Boschplaat near Terschelling. In this stranding, 258 passengers and 3 crew members perished. The passengers were emigrants on their way to America. Because they were locked in the ship's hold, they were unable to save themselves. The drowned were buried in a mass grave near the church in Hoorn. Captain Ernst Christian Kross, who was among the dead, received his own grave with a headstone that still stands in the cemetery. Furthermore, 17 British fishing vessels were lost near Texel, with more than 60 men perishing, mostly from Barking near London. Many other casualties occurred elsewhere. More than 200 ships were stranded on the British coasts, with dozens of people drowning. Several Ostend fishing boats also sank, with crew members losing their lives."

On Koster, hurricane-force gusts reached a strength of 35 meters per second, and on Väderö, 34 meters per second. Skåne was also affected by the storm. In Skåne, 3,000 households were left without power. The storm was caused by a low-pressure system that formed over the Labrador Sea southwest of Greenland. This system passed by Iceland on January 30. The low-pressure system was named \"Resi\" by the Free University of Berlin. On Thursday, January 31, the air pressure dropped to 950 hectopascals, and the storm slowly moved over the North Sea in a straight path over the Faroe and Shetland Islands. During Thursday, a large area around the center of the low-pressure system was hit by the storm. At the same time, there were severe weather events. In the Irish Sea, the cargo ferry \"The Riverdance\" was shipwrecked. The Faroe Islands were paralyzed by a massive snowstorm. In Norway, Sörlandet and Östlandet were affected. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute named the extreme weather Tuva. Over southern Sweden, both a warm front and a cold front passed. In total, more than 27,000 households were affected by power outages during the storm. On Friday, February 1, the low-pressure system moved over the North Sea down to Stavanger in southern Norway. The two weather fronts, which brought heavy precipitation, later moved northward over Sweden. On February 2, the low-pressure system split. Two low-pressure centers formed over northern Scandinavia, each with approximately 970 hectopascals. Shortly thereafter, the low-pressure zone significantly weakened. On February 3, a new low-pressure system formed over the North Sea, dominating the entire weather situation in Western Europe. Storm Tuva was already the third storm to pass over Sweden in 2008."

Molave formed from an area of meteorological disturbances east of the Philippines on May 14. Initially moving northwest, Molave became a tropical storm the following day. Under reasonably favorable meteorological conditions, Molave continued to gradually intensify and became a severe tropical storm, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), on July 17. Molave became a typhoon the next day, at which point it reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h, shortly before making landfall in southeastern China at this intensity. Shortly thereafter, Molave began to weaken rapidly over land and completely dissipated on June 19. Even without directly hitting the Philippines, its outer rain bands caused heavy storms in the archipelago. At least five people died in that country as a result of the cyclone's direct effects. In China, two fishermen went missing at sea when their boat was caught by the strong sea agitation caused by the typhoon."

                "header": "Meteorological history",
                "content": "Molave originated from an area of meteorological disturbances that persisted about 280 km east-southeast of Yap, Federated States of Micronesia, on July 10. Initially, the system only exhibited a poorly defined and elongated low-level cyclonic circulation. However, mid-level convective activity was favorable for the system's continued organization. The disturbance gradually developed, and by July 11, the system already had a more defined low-level cyclonic circulation with good upper-level outflow. Additionally, the system was located in an area with favorable meteorological conditions for its development, such as low wind shear. However, later that day, the system failed to establish itself, and its areas of deep convection began to fragment. Its low-level cyclonic center became less defined. Furthermore, the upper-level outflows from another nearby tropical disturbance negatively affected the system. The following day, the disturbance lost definition and was no longer monitored. However, during the night (UTC) of July 13, the system reorganized, and the sudden increase in areas of deep convection associated with the formation of a low-level cyclonic circulation led the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the U.S. Navy agency responsible for monitoring tropical cyclones, to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system, indicating that the disturbance could become a significant tropical cyclone within 12 to 24 hours. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the meteorological agency designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for monitoring tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, noted the system's evolution and classified it as a weak tropical depression early on July 14. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also classified the system as a tropical depression hours later, assigning it the Filipino name \"Isang.\" Later that night, the JTWC issued a second TCFA for the system, extending the timeframe for the disturbance to become a significant tropical cyclone. On the morning (UTC) of July 15, the JMA classified the system as a full tropical depression with the continued organization of the disturbance. With the formation of defined storm bands and the establishment of good upper-level outflows enhanced by the presence of an upper-level anticyclone just southwest of the system, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical depression that same morning (UTC), assigning it the designation 07W. That night (UTC), with the formation of more areas of deep convection and the consolidation of its low-level cyclonic center, the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm. At that time, there were modest outflows associated with a tropical upper tropospheric trough, and the low wind shear allowed the system's intensification trend to continue. The system continued to gradually intensify as it moved west-northwest. By noon (UTC) on July 16, the JMA also classified the system as a tropical storm and named it \"Molave,\" a name submitted to the typhoon naming list by the Philippines, referring to a type of hardwood used in ornament crafting in one of the languages spoken in that archipelago. Molave continued to move northwest under the influence of a subtropical high to its northeast. On the morning (UTC) of July 16, a second, smaller low-level cyclonic circulation separated from Molave. Initially, Molave was unable to develop rapidly; the tropical upper tropospheric trough that provided good upper-level outflows transformed into an upper-level low-pressure area, negatively impacting the cyclone with associated wind shear. However, from the morning (UTC) of July 17, Molave began to intensify more rapidly with the sudden consolidation of its low-level cyclonic circulation. Despite the intrusion of dry air into the cyclone, Molave was able to intensify more quickly due to the formation of new areas of deep convection facilitated by the establishment of good meridional upper-level outflows. The nearby upper-level low-pressure area moved away, reducing wind shear. Additionally, the warm waters in the region further favored the storm's development. The JMA noted the system's evolution and classified it as a severe tropical storm that same morning. During the morning (UTC) of July 18, Molave experienced a brief period of disorganization but quickly resumed intensification, becoming a typhoon by noon (UTC) on July 18, according to the JMA. Near the southeastern coast of China, Molave began to exhibit a small eye surrounded by intense areas of deep convection, and hours later, the JTWC also classified the system as a typhoon. However, Molave had at that point reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h and a minimum central atmospheric pressure of 975 mbar, according to the JMA and JTWC. Molave's intensification trend was interrupted when the typhoon made landfall on the coast of China's Guangdong province, near Hong Kong, at its peak intensity. As Molave's cyclonic center crossed the coast, interaction with land began to negatively affect the cyclone, which rapidly lost its associated areas of deep convection and consequently began to weaken. As a result, the JMA downgraded Molave to a severe tropical storm early that evening (UTC). The JTWC also downgraded Molave to a tropical storm hours later. Over southeastern China, Molave quickly weakened, and the JMA downgraded Molave to a simple tropical storm early on the morning (UTC) of July 19. The JTWC issued its final advisory on Molave hours later as the system continued to degrade over China. The JMA downgraded Molave to a tropical depression and also issued its final advisory on the system later that morning (UTC)."

The following day, the Hong Kong Observatory, responsible for the city's meteorology, raised a level I storm warning, the lowest of 10 levels. The Macau government acted similarly. On July 18, the alert level in Hong Kong had risen to level III, which remained in effect for about seven hours before the Hong Kong government decided to raise the alert to level VIII. Later that day, the storm warning in the city was raised to level IX and remained so for about three hours before the alert level was downgraded as the typhoon passed over the region. The Vietnamese government also warned the country's population about the presence of Molave near its territory; the country had already suffered from the effects of tropical storm Soudelor in the region days earlier. The Guangdong (Canton) government requested that all vessels return to ports as Molave approached the region. More than 1,600 fishermen returned to ports, and another 600 were prevented from going to sea. Additionally, the government sent more than 20 million SMS messages to alert residents about the approaching typhoon."

Molave caused five deaths in the Philippines, leaving one person injured. Most of the deaths were caused by drowning in floods and flash floods. A landslide destroyed five houses and damaged three others in Rizal province. At least 545 families were isolated by floods and landslides. The total damages caused by Storm Molave in the archipelago amounted to 380,000 Philippine pesos (7,900 dollars). In Taiwan, Molave's outer storm bands caused heavy rains; accumulated precipitation reached 235 mm in Kaohsiung. However, no impacts associated with Molave were reported in the country. In southern China, Molave caused more than 320 mm of rain, triggering floods, flash floods, and landslides. In Nanning, the floods caused serious traffic accidents. A vessel with seven people on board was adrift during the storm's passage off the coast of Shantou. Rescue teams reached the vessel on July 20 and safely rescued everyone on board. Two fishermen went missing when their boat capsized due to the strong waves caused by the typhoon. Molave's remnant system reached northern Vietnam, causing torrential rains. The floods affected large areas of rice fields as well as several communities. In Bac Lieu province, 32 homes were completely destroyed. In Soc Trang province, five other homes were destroyed, and 41 others were damaged, leaving seven people injured. In Phu Tho province, more than 300 homes lost their roofs, and 96 electricity poles were knocked down due to strong winds."

Exact wind speeds are not known due to the inadequacy of measuring devices at the time, but meteorologist Pauli Jokinen has presented estimates in his thesis of average wind speeds on the Baltic Sea at 30–35 m/s, on land areas at 17–23 m/s, gust peaks likely at 27–40 m/s, and possibly over 40 m/s in downdrafts caused by convection. According to some claims, the average wind speed in Helsinki was even 50 m/s. A photograph from Honkanummi in Vantaa shows broken pine trees, the highest scaffolding of St. John's Church in Helsinki collapsed, and hail fell. The storm was extensive and lasted significantly long in one location. In southern Finland, tens of thousands of trees fell, with the thickest trunks having a diameter of 40 cm. The storm claimed at least three lives."

                "content": "The Mauri storm was a powerful low-pressure system, the remnants of the tropical cyclone Debby that originated in the Atlantic, which felled forests in Northern Finland on September 21–22, 1982. Forest damage was observed over a wide area extending from Oulu to Inari. The highest 10-minute average wind speed on land was measured in Oulu at 19 meters per second. The strongest sustained wind speed over sea areas, 29 meters per second, was recorded in Moikipää. Gusts reached wind speeds of 40–50 meters per second. The storm, which rose from the Bay of Bothnia, surprised residents, particularly in Tornio and Kemi as well as other coastal municipalities. The Finnish Meteorological Institute's weather forecasts had not warned of the storm in advance, instead predicting brisk southerly or southwesterly winds for the area. The storm's unexpected nature was further emphasized by the fact that the previous day's weather had been sunny and warm. According to eyewitnesses, the storm broke out completely unexpectedly in the afternoon of September 21, 1982. Millions of cubic meters of forest were felled; in the city of Rovaniemi alone, about 4,000 trees were toppled. In addition to the wind, damage was caused by the high sea level, which destroyed the marinas in Kemi and Tornio. The highest official water level measurement was from Kemi: +201 cm. Even east of the Saariselkä fell area, at the Jaurujoki River, the storm felled about 265,000 cubic meters of forest; this destruction area was incorporated into the Urho Kekkonen National Park the following year. When the timber market was flooded with storm-damaged wood in the fall of 1982, the price of raw wood plummeted. On the other hand, the clearing of storm damage was facilitated by the fact that permanent snow fell unusually late in the fall of 1982. The Mauri storm is suspected to have generated at least one tornado, which felled trees in clusters toward a central point. There were two fatalities: a couple who sought shelter in their vacation cabin on Vitagrunn Island in Tornio. The cabin was torn from its foundation by the storm winds and carried about a kilometer across the water, smashing into the mainland's rocky shore in Laivaniemi, Tornio. The wind also hurled boats weighing thousands of kilograms far inland."

The first official recognition of the drought and famine occurred in a speech by President Siad Barre on October 21, 1974, followed by the declaration of a state of emergency on November 29. Shortly thereafter, a National Drought Relief Committee and corresponding committees at regional, district, and village levels were established. In the most affected areas of Sanaag, Togdheer, Bari, Nugaal, Mudug, and Galguduud, camps with medical facilities and educational offerings for those affected were set up. These camps were managed by camp committees, each consisting of a teacher from the Rural Development Campaign, a health officer, an agent of the National Security Service, and three representatives of the camp residents. By November/December 1974, about 112,000 people had moved into these camps, with an additional 3,000 to 5,000 arriving daily. By May 1975, the number of drought refugees had reached 772,000. The state mobilized extensive resources and redirected funds intended for rural development projects into emergency relief measures. Foreign aid initially came mainly from the Soviet Union, later also from Western countries, as well as from Nigeria and Uganda within Africa."

Around 90,000 nomads who had lost their livestock were relocated from camps in the north to agricultural settlements in southern Somalia starting in mid-1975, and another 15,000 were resettled along the coast. From 1976 to the mid-1980s, efforts were made with international support to provide them with new livelihoods in agriculture or fishing. However, the yields from these projects often fell short of expectations, leading many settlers to leave these settlements again."

From July to August, there were consecutive days of record-breaking high temperatures, and many observation points from western Japan to the Kanto region recorded the highest temperatures since observations began (16 years later, the summer of 2010 was hotter than this year, but due to higher spring rainfall, it did not result in a drought). With continued clear skies, rainfall in many areas remained at about 30-70 percent of the average. As a result, especially in regions such as northern Kyushu, the Seto Inland Sea coast, and the Tokai region, the supply of tap water became difficult, and water supply restrictions, such as scheduled water outages, were implemented. The impact affected 16.6 million people, and the damage to agricultural crops amounted to 140.9 billion yen [1]."

After the rainy season ended on July 1, intense heat persisted daily, and the dam's water storage began to decrease rapidly. As a result, the Fukuoka Prefecture and the Kyushu Regional Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Construction established a Drought Countermeasures Headquarters on July 6, initiating measures such as calls for water conservation. On July 9, water intake restrictions from the Chikugo River began, and by mid-July, many municipalities in Fukuoka Prefecture had established Drought Countermeasures Headquarters. On July 13, the dam reservoir rate in Fukuoka Prefecture fell below 60 percent, and on July 14, the Fukuoka District Meteorological Observatory issued the \"First Information on Low Rainfall and High Temperatures\" for northern Kyushu, calling for caution against water shortages. By July 20, the dam reservoir rate in Fukuoka Prefecture dropped below 50 percent, and on July 21, nighttime water outages began in Dazaifu City. Although rain from Typhoon No. 7 fell on the night of July 25, the situation did not improve, and nighttime water outages began in Onojo City on July 27 and in Fukuoka City on August 4. \n\nAlthough the water shortage temporarily stabilized in early August, it worsened again in late August, and by August 20, the dam reservoir rate in Fukuoka Prefecture fell below 25 percent. On August 22, nighttime water outages began in Chikushino City as well. On September 2, emergency releases of some water for power generation were conducted from Matsubara Dam and Shimoike Dam. On September 27, the reservoir rate of Terauchi Dam reached 0 percent, and the use of dead water (water accumulated below the intake point) began. Although it started to rain in September, the dam reservoir rate in Fukuoka City remained around 30 percent even in October, leading to prolonged water outages. During the year-end and New Year period from December 28 to January 4 of the following year, water outages were temporarily lifted as a special measure. \n\nOn March 3, 1995 (Heisei 7), the dam reservoir rate in Fukuoka Prefecture reached its lowest point at 15.2 percent, but from April onward, significant rainfall began, and on May 17, water outages were lifted in Dazaifu City. By late May, the dam reservoir rate in Fukuoka City recovered to 68 percent, and on June 1, water outages in Fukuoka City were lifted. The water outages in Fukuoka City lasted 295 days, surpassing the drought of 1978-1979 (Showa 53-54), but water supply during supply hours was maintained, and complaints to the city's waterworks bureau were about one-fifth of those during the previous drought."

On July 25, Typhoon No. 7 made landfall in Kochi Prefecture, bringing over 500mm of heavy rain in some areas of Shikoku, which slightly restored the water levels of major dams. However, after the typhoon dissipated, the region was hit by another heatwave, causing the water level of the Sameura Dam to continue declining, eventually drying up completely at 0% on August 19. The water outage in Takamatsu City lasted for 67 days until September 30, and water supply restrictions continued for 139 days until November 14.

Triggered by precipitation from the summer of the previous year, 1977 (Shōwa 52), to the following spring being less than 70% of the average, recovery was delayed due to reliance on dams as water sources, leading to water supply restrictions with scheduled water outages for 287 days."

During the 1950s, the increase in water demand outpaced the securing of water sources, resulting in repeated water supply restrictions almost every year. However, the situation eventually improved, and after 1968 (Showa 43), water supply restrictions were not implemented except for 1975 (Showa 50). \n\nSince there are no major rivers within Fukuoka City, dam construction was promoted to meet the increasing water demand. Six dams, including Egawa Dam, Kuhara Dam, Minamihata Dam, Sefuri Dam, Magaribuchi Dam, and Zuibaiji Dam, became the main water sources. However, the construction of these dams was delayed due to other projects, and the development could not keep up with urbanization. Additionally, a \"jinx\" emerged where water storage rates in the dams would recover due to heavy rain after preparations for water supply restrictions began. Furthermore, relatively low water rates compared to other cities led to lenient judgments regarding waterworks management.\n\nUntil June 1977 (Showa 52), precipitation was at normal levels, and the storage rate of the six dams (total storage capacity of 39.06 million tons) was over 90%. However, from July onward, there was a trend of low rainfall, and by September, the storage rate had fallen below 50%. From December of the same year to April 1978 (Showa 53), precipitation was about half of the average, and by early February, the dam storage rate had dropped to 25%. The city waterworks bureau anticipated recovery with the usual spring rains and did not take special measures.\n\nContrary to the waterworks bureau's expectations, the low rainfall continued, and from March to May 1978, precipitation remained less than half of the average. The dam storage levels continued to decline. Even in May, rainfall was about one-third of the average, and as the dam storage rate began to fall below 30%, the Fukuoka City Waterworks Bureau issued a water crisis declaration on May 10, calling for water conservation. On May 15, a drought countermeasures headquarters was established, and starting May 20, 10 days after the crisis declaration, nighttime water outages from 9 PM to 6 AM (9 hours) began."

Numerous complaints were filed with the city water bureau, prompting the authorities to dispatch water trucks to the housing complexes.

However, despite the shortened stay, many sumo stables faced a de facto price increase as bathing fees remained unchanged. Notably, the Nishonoseki stable and Kokonoe stable, which shared expenses and contracted with nearby public baths, were charged double the usual fees, prompting them to build separate bathing facilities. Additionally, the Hanaregoma stable, Futagoyama stable, and Tatsutagawa stable, which set up lodgings in Momochi near Hakata Bay, could not use well water due to its salinity. The Hanaregoma stable installed a 4-ton water tank (later adding 1 ton), while the Futagoyama stable installed a 1-ton water tank on the roof of their lodging. The Tatsutagawa stable secured water for daily use by storing it in 120-liter plastic buckets. Despite these challenges, sumo remained highly popular, and Tokitsukaze Oyakata (director in charge of the Kyushu tournament for the Japan Sumo Association) expressed his gratitude in a post-event interview, saying, \"I was pleased to feel the warm support for sumo.\""

Additionally, water intake from the Naka River, Mikasa River, and Tatara River has been enhanced, along with the development of new water resources. In Fukuoka Prefecture, three new dams—Hase Dam, Ino Dam, and Narufuchi Dam—were constructed in the Tatara River system, while in the Naka River system, the redevelopment of Minamihata Dam was carried out, increasing its reservoir capacity by excavation. As of 2018, the Gokayama Dam is being constructed upstream of the Minamihata Dam. Furthermore, in the Chikugo River system, the largest in Kyushu, Egawa and Terauchi Dams were built, and in 1984, the Chikugo Weir was constructed. This allowed water intake from the Chikugo River via the weir, and efforts were made to supply water from the Kikuchi River system using the Ryumon Dam. Water supply has significantly improved. In 2005, the seawater desalination center \"Mamizu Pier\" in Nata, Higashi Ward, began operations, enabling the supply of up to 50,000 cubic meters of freshwater per day from seawater. In 2011, the Northern Fukuoka Emergency Connection Pipe, which facilitates mutual water supply between the Kitakyushu City Waterworks Bureau and the Fukuoka City Waterworks Bureau/Fukuoka District Waterworks Association, began operations. In emergencies, it can supply up to 50,000 cubic meters of water per day, equivalent to drinking water for 2.5 million people, to 18 cities and towns, including Fukuoka and Kitakyushu. Measures were also taken to address water outages in high-altitude residential areas, which had become a significant issue, by advancing water distribution control and strengthening inter-system coordination. During the 1994 water shortage in Fukuoka City, long-term water supply restrictions were implemented, but water supply during designated hours was maintained, and water trucks were not deployed. TOTO, headquartered in Kitakyushu City, launched its water-saving CS series products in May 1976, which then spread nationwide. Subsequently, other companies in the same industry entered the market, and water-saving products have now become the standard. However, when using reclaimed water systems (treated water), there are cases where equipment damage is accelerated or worsened, particularly in systems that supply water for handwashing, lower body washing, and toilet flushing from a shared source."

In particular, in 1977, water supply restrictions were implemented for 169 days. As a result, redevelopment of the Fukuchi Dam through heightening began, and the construction of five new dams (Henoki Dam, Haneji Dam, Fukugawa Dam, Kanna Dam, and Amu Dam) in the northern part of Okinawa Island was initiated. In 1981, rainfall during the rainy season was less than half of the average, and water usage increased due to rising temperatures, causing the water storage levels of each dam to continue to decline. By the end of June, the total water storage of the three prefecture-managed dams had fallen below 60% of full capacity, and the Fukuchi Dam had fallen below 80%. As a result, on July 1, the Okinawa Prefecture Drought Countermeasures Headquarters meeting was held, and from July 11, nighttime water outages from 8 PM to 6 AM the following morning began across almost the entire Okinawa Island, except for a small part of the northern region."

Alternate-day water supply restrictions involved dividing Okinawa Island into two zones, alternating water supply and suspension every 24 hours for each zone. Although nighttime water supply restrictions temporarily resumed on July 22, alternate-day restrictions were reinstated on August 24. Typhoon No. 18 passed west of Okinawa Island from August 30 to 31, causing wind damage but failing to bring the expected rainfall, exacerbating the water shortage. On October 18, an attempt was made to induce artificial rainfall by spraying water from a Self-Defense Force P-2J aircraft over Fukuchi Dam, but it was ineffective, and by October 20, the water storage rate of the three prefecture-managed dams had dropped to 5.1%, nearly drying up. On October 21, Typhoon No. 24 passed east of Okinawa Island, bringing significant rainfall, but it was insufficient to restore water levels, and water supply restrictions continued. In response to this situation, 5,000 poly containers were sent as relief supplies from Fukuoka City, which had experienced a drought in 1978. During the year-end and New Year period from December 30 to January 3, water supply restrictions were temporarily lifted as a special measure. After the New Year, water supply restrictions resumed on January 4, 1982, and on January 14, an attempt was made to induce artificial rainfall using dry ice, but only about 5 millimeters of rain was achieved. The water level of Fukuchi Dam, which was relied upon, continued to drop, and by February, the storage rate fell below 40%. With no rain expected in weather forecasts, water supply hours were further reduced by four hours starting February 15, resulting in 20-hour water supply every other day. Dams under construction at the time were completed one month ahead of schedule through rushed construction, with Fukugawa Dam beginning water storage on February 22 and Anba Dam on March 1, enabling water transfer to Fukuchi Dam.

The great drought, as it was known, caused the largest wave of internal migration in the country, resulting in the departure of approximately 164,183 people over these 20 years, along with other factors. Most of those affected were economically active individuals, aged between 20 and 40 years. It occurred during Ecuador's last dictatorship, at a time when agrarian reform was implemented, which attracted migrants to the most populated cities, such as Quito, Guayaquil, and the surrounding cities, as well as to the coast, in the province of El Oro, during the banana industry boom. Its most critical point took place in 1968, when crops such as corn, vegetables, beans, and rice were produced by the hectare in the province. Loja's culture developed an independent inclination from the country, stemming from the Peruvian-Ecuadorian war and this drought, influencing politics, such as agrarian reform; society, such as migration; gastronomy, with low-cost dishes like repe lojano; and art, such as murals."

Precipitation in the drought-affected areas was 20-80% less than the same period in previous years, with Hubei and Jiangxi experiencing the lowest levels since 1961, and Anhui experiencing the second-lowest levels for the same period. The drought event went through two phases. The first phase lasted from late July to mid-November, during which moderate to severe meteorological drought was widespread in most parts of Hubei, northern Hunan, northern Jiangxi, and most of Anhui, with extreme drought in eastern Hubei and southern Anhui. Two rounds of rainfall in mid-to-late November alleviated the drought in eastern Hubei and northern Hunan. The second phase lasted from late November to the end of December, during which precipitation in southern Jiangxi and most of Guangdong was 50-90% less than the same period in previous years, and the drought persisted.

                "header": "2021 Taiwan Drought Water Shortage Crisis",
                "content": "The 2021 Taiwan drought and water shortage crisis was a large-scale drought event that occurred in early 2021 in the western region of Taiwan's main island, leading to varying degrees of water pressure reduction, water rationing, fallow farming, and business closures. It was the most severe drought since 1947 and was referred to as the \"century drought.\" This drought was alleviated between late May and late June by several waves of plum rain fronts, showers, and southwest monsoon rains, and the Central Drought Response Center was deactivated on June 22. By late July to early August, significant rainfall brought by Typhoon In-Fa, Typhoon Lupit, and southwest monsoon fronts restored normal water conditions across Taiwan's main island and the outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu by August 5, marking the end of this drought.\n\nThe 2021 drought was caused by a short and insufficient rainy season during Taiwan's 2020 plum rain season, followed by a typhoon season without any typhoons making landfall or approaching Taiwan. The two most critical water collection periods for reservoirs in western Taiwan experienced low rainfall, resulting in low reservoir storage levels, which relied solely on summer showers for replenishment. Subsequently, the autumn and winter dry seasons in the southwest, which are typically low in rainfall, made it difficult to alleviate the drought. Hopes were placed on spring rains from February to April to ease the drought, but due to factors such as the La Niña phenomenon, the 2021 spring rainfall was the lowest on record, causing reservoir storage levels to continue to decline. In May, the Pacific high-pressure system abnormally strengthened and extended westward, and the plum rain front developed further north, leading to high temperatures and low rainfall in Taiwan, delaying and reducing the plum rain season. With no hope of replenishment, reservoirs in western Taiwan gradually reached critical alert levels, and some areas in central Taiwan began implementing water rationing measures in early April.\n\nIn the southwestern Pingtung region, however, abundant and well-developed groundwater resources prevented the area from entering a drought alert status by May, despite low rainfall. This was due to water resource reserves and utilization, including the Erfeng Irrigation Canal, designed by Shinpei Goto during the Japanese colonial period, which was restored in early 2017, and the Dazhou Artificial Lake, completed in 2018, which serves as a groundwater recharge lake. The lake has injected 50 to 70 million tons of water into the underground aquifer, acting as an underground reservoir.\n\nIn contrast, northern and eastern Taiwan did not face water shortages due to abundant rainfall brought by the northeast monsoon during the 2020-2021 autumn and winter seasons. The Feitsui Reservoir had surplus capacity to assist the Shimen Reservoir's supply area during the water shortage, extending the Shimen Reservoir's supply period.\n\nLong-term observations indicate that rainfall brought by typhoons contributes approximately 40% of Taiwan's annual precipitation. However, the strong Pacific subtropical high-pressure system in 2020 resulted in a lack of typhoons for Taiwan. Climate model assessments suggest that human-induced climate change will significantly strengthen the Northwest Pacific subtropical high-pressure system. This implies that under climate change, Taiwan will face long-term drought challenges with reduced precipitation in the future."

                "content": "In 2017, the Lin Chuan Cabinet of the Executive Yuan deployed relevant water conservancy projects in the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program to address Taiwan's climate change and uneven drought and flood conditions. After several years of construction and implementation, the related facilities proved effective during this drought. In July 2020, the Ministry of Economic Affairs preemptively deployed measures, strengthened management and allocation, and accelerated the completion of related water resource construction and the Drought-Resistant Water Source 1.0 Plan. In 2021, to cope with the current drought, the government and private sector sought various ways to develop emergency water sources, and the second Su Tseng-chang Cabinet launched the Drought-Resistant Water Source 2.0 Plan in March.\n\nThe number of drought-resistant wells in Taichung increased from 25 to 88, with drilling operations running 24 hours a day. By the end of the month or early May, the daily water supply could reach 115,000 tons, equivalent to the water usage of 500,000 people. Emergency deployment of CPC Corporation drilling experts with specialized equipment drilled three deeper wells near Liyutan Reservoir, adding approximately 15,000 tons of water daily, expected to be completed by the end of April.\n\nAfter Kaohsiung's water status turned to orange in April, the city government, in collaboration with the Water Resources Agency, drilled 62 wells and allocated water from Chengcing Lake Reservoir. By May 5, the reservoir's water storage increased to 92%, holding 2.42 million tons, resolving Kaohsiung's May water crisis of turning to red status.\n\nThe Ministry of Economic Affairs urgently added a seawater desalination plant in Taichung, with the first phase supplying water on May 15, increasing the daily water supply by 13,000 tons. By the end of May, the daily supply increased to 15,000 tons. The Wuxi riverbed water guidance project in Taichung added 55,000 tons of water daily.\n\nThe Kaohsiung City Government and the Water Resources Agency completed subsurface water facilities such as Xingtian, Xipu, and Dazuan upstream of the Gaoping River weir as part of the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program. These facilities were initially completed in 2020, supplying 400,000 tons of raw water daily and 300,000 tons of backup water. The backup water has been activated in response to the current drought.\n\nIn Taichung, water from construction sites of major projects like Lafayette and CMP was tested and filtered to meet tap water standards before being integrated into the tap water system. In Tainan, groundwater quality from the Guiren construction project was tested and found suitable for domestic use. The Tainan City Government installed large-scale RO water purification equipment, expected to supply 350 tons of water daily into the tap water pipeline.\n\nOn March 13, Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je stated that Taipei had begun expanding water support, transporting 910,000 tons of water daily to New Taipei, Keelung, and Taoyuan to facilitate the transfer of water from Shimen Reservoir to Hsinchu and Miaoli.\n\nFrom September 2020 to April 22, 2021, the Water Resources Agency's rain enhancement team conducted 45 artificial rain enhancement operations in reservoir catchment areas across northern, central, and southern Taiwan. These included 32 ground-based operations, 8 high-altitude flare operations, 2 drone-based experiments, and 3 Air Force aerial operations.\n\nAt noon on May 17, the Water Resources Agency released rain enhancement flares at Bao'er, Yongheshan, and Mingde Reservoirs. However, Deputy Director Wang Yifeng stated that due to weak cloud systems, the rainfall was minimal, rendering the artificial rain enhancement operation \"almost ineffective.\"\n\nDomestic sewage and industrial wastewater, after treatment at sewage treatment plants and further precision filtration and purification at reclaimed water plants, can be used for non-domestic purposes, preventing competition for water between industrial, domestic, and agricultural uses."

                "content": "The Central Drought Disaster Response Center decided in a meeting on March 24 that due to severe water conditions in parts of Miaoli, Taichung, and northern Changhua (Changhua City and parts of Hemei and Huatan), a red alert for zoned water supply will be implemented starting April 6. Additionally, from April 1, the water alert in Kaohsiung will change from a yellow alert for reduced pressure water supply to an orange alert for reduced water supply, and in Lienchiang, the alert will change from a green alert for water conservation reminders to a yellow alert for reduced pressure water supply. The zoned water supply areas are divided into two zones, with water supplied for five days and cut off for two days, aiming to save 15% of water. Due to the drought in central reservoirs, the Central Drought Disaster Response Center announced that parts of Miaoli and Taichung would enter a \"5 days on, 2 days off\" water restriction for residential use starting April 6, affecting approximately 1.064 million households. This is Taiwan's third large-scale zoned water supply in nearly 20 years. The Central Taiwan Science Park and Houli Science Park, which have dedicated pipelines, will reduce supply but not stop it. Although rainfall in April remained unsatisfactory, several emergency water supply measures proved effective, and on May 6, the Central Drought Disaster Response Center decided to maintain the current water alert levels. Due to the continued decline in the water storage rate of Shimen Reservoir, the water alert in Taoyuan City and Linkou District of New Taipei City was changed to an orange alert for reduced water supply starting May 21. At the end of May, consecutive afternoon thunderstorms increased the water volume of the Gaoping River and raised the water storage rate of Chengqing Lake Reservoir. On May 29, the water alert in Kaohsiung was changed from an orange alert to a yellow alert for reduced pressure water supply. From June 4 to June 6, Typhoon Choi-wan and the plum rain front brought abundant rainfall to Taiwan, alleviating the water situation. Starting June 6, the red alert for zoned water supply in Miaoli, Taichung, and northern Changhua was lifted, ending the longest water restriction in history.  \n\nIn response to the \"5 days on, 2 days off\" water restriction, the Taichung City Government's Sports Bureau temporarily closed public swimming pools in Taichung starting April 6. Only three locations—the competition pool at the North District National Sports Center, the Wuri heated swimming pool, and the Zhongxing swimming pool—were designated for priority use by athletes during training sessions. To reduce inconvenience caused by water cuts, the Water Corporation decided to undertake emergency pipeline construction, utilizing a deep well drilled last year at the Water Resources Planning and Experiment Institute in Wufeng to support parts of Caohu in Dali District, Taichung City, with an expected daily water supply of 2,000 tons upon completion.  \n\nIn response to water restrictions, the Changhua County Government temporarily opened the swimming pool at the Changbei Sports Center from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. starting April 6. The county government also guided public and private swimming pools and sauna operators to suspend operations. However, similar to the guidance for car wash businesses to suspend services, some operators expressed dissatisfaction. To find water sources, many residents applied for legal well drilling, with the number of monthly applications for legal water rights and well drilling in 2021 significantly increasing compared to the previous year, mostly for agricultural use.  \n\nIn Chiayi City, starting March 23, all elementary and middle schools suspended swimming pool courses, replacing them with indoor courses such as water safety and lifesaving education. In Chiayi County, starting April 1, schools suspended the use of swimming pools, and swimming classes were replaced with alternative courses. Public-private partnership and private swimming pools were left to comply with central policies on their own.  \n\nIn Tainan City, starting April 22, water taps in 76 large parks under its jurisdiction, except for public restrooms, were shut off to enforce water-saving measures, with an estimated monthly water savings of about 2,000 tons. Additionally, starting April 26, water supply to saunas, car washes, and swimming pools was stopped. Some car wash operators expressed dissatisfaction after being notified, as the regulations only controlled legal operators but failed to restrict illegal ones. Schools also temporarily suspended swimming classes. To encourage water conservation among residents and businesses, the Tainan City Government introduced incentive measures, offering vouchers worth thousands of dollars for meeting specified water-saving targets. Since the suspension of water supply to swimming pools would affect athlete training, considering the importance of uninterrupted training and the impact of competition results on educational advancement, four public swimming pools were designated as centralized training bases for Tainan swimming athletes.  \n\nThe Kaohsiung City Government's Sports Development Bureau announced that starting April 1, six self-managed public swimming pools—Qijin, Sanmin, Gushan, Youchang, Jiaxian, and Dongmen—would be closed. Starting April 19, all 10 self-managed public swimming pools under the bureau (International Pool, Sanmin Pool, Xinxing Pool, Qijin Pool, Gushan Pool, Zuoying Pool, Youchang Pool, Nanzi Pool, Jiaxian Pool, and Dongmen Pool) would suspend operations in line with the city's water restriction and drought response measures. Outsourced and managed swimming pools would not replenish new water but would enhance water filtration frequency to maintain water quality. Additionally, the four swimming pools at incinerator feedback facilities (Central, Southern, Gangshan, and Renwu) under the Kaohsiung City Environmental Protection Bureau reduced their daily sessions from four to two starting April 1. However, due to the continued severity of the water situation, these four swimming pools were completely closed starting April 19 and would reopen only after the water alert was lifted.  \n\nKaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai announced on April 16 that starting April 17, tap water supply to car washes and public and private swimming pools would be stopped. Additionally, the Southern Region Water Resources Office and the Water Corporation initiated a well-drilling project, aiming to increase daily water supply by 160,000 tons by the end of the month and up to 300,000 tons in May to ensure that Kaohsiung's water situation does not enter the red alert stage of \"5 days on, 2 days off.\""

On May 5, the Council of Agriculture of the Executive Yuan announced that Xinshe, Shigang, and Waipu districts in Taichung City are designated areas for \"Kyoho grape\" agricultural natural disaster cash relief, with an estimated loss of NT$15.23 million for Kyoho grapes and NT$2.25 million for peanuts. \n\nIn Changhua, the bamboo shoot yield has also decreased, with green bamboo shoots expected to sprout in May, estimated to have a 30% reduction in production. Changhua cabbage has been reported to suffer from \"tip burn,\" with dry leaves and cores, poor appearance, low purchasing willingness from traders, and falling prices.\n\nIn Chiayi County's Alishan area, tea and bamboo shoots have been severely affected. Tea plantations in mountainous areas such as Gukeng and Zhanghu in Yunlin have also experienced tea tree wilting, death, and stagnation in tea leaf growth, leading to reduced production areas and lower yields compared to the past. These conditions have met the standards for agricultural natural disaster cash relief, and subsidies can be applied for.\n\nIn Baihe District, Tainan City, the lotus industry has been affected by irrigation water shortages. The city government has initiated natural disaster relief and coordinated with relevant departments to allocate water sources for irrigation.\n\nIn Kaohsiung, plum and tea tree farmers have reported losses. The local government has confirmed that the disaster meets the threshold for disaster recognition. The city’s Agriculture Bureau will seek natural disaster cash relief and low-interest loans for the plum and tea tree industries. Additionally, agricultural losses have been reported for Yuhebao lychees and black-leaf lychees. After joint inspections by the city government and farmers' associations, subsidies for affected farmers are being planned.\n\nAccording to the Council of Agriculture of the Executive Yuan, agricultural losses across Taiwan due to drought have exceeded NT$500 million. Before the arrival of the May rainy season, agricultural losses may continue to expand.

Residents have found dead tilapia and eels on the riverbed, which have dried up after exposure to the scorching sun.  \n\nSeveral reservoirs have seen water levels drop to record lows in recent years, revealing structures that were previously submerged. For example, the old Route 3 in the Liyutan Reservoir in Miaoli has reappeared due to the low water levels. The Yong'an Bridge in the Yongheshan Reservoir has also resurfaced, attracting many visitors eager to witness the sight.  \n\nThe water level of Sun Moon Lake has dropped significantly, and by mid-April, it was 13 meters below the full water level. The lakebed has dried up, the land has cracked, garbage at the bottom of the lake has been exposed, and even grasslands have appeared. The Nantou County Government is uncertain whether the 2021 Sun Moon Lake Swimming Carnival can proceed as scheduled. Nantou County Education Director Lu Zhengwei stated that Sun Moon Lake serves important functions such as hydropower generation and domestic water supply.

Additionally, several thermal power units that could have immediately responded were under maintenance, and hydropower units such as Sun Moon Lake and Deji Reservoir were unavailable due to drought conditions, resulting in a temporary power shortage and a drop in grid frequency. Taiwan Power Company implemented emergency rolling blackouts by region."

On March 7, 2021, the Irrigation Agency and Dajia Jenn Lann Temple co-hosted a rain prayer ritual. Following ancient traditions, the ceremony included offerings to the Rain God and the Shangyang bird, with 3,000 attendees dressed in white and holding incense for worship. Jenn Lann Temple Chairman Yen Ching-piao and Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen, along with five directors from water and agricultural departments, participated throughout. On March 15, the Taoyuan Ferry Yacht Association held a Mazu water pilgrimage event, inviting the Shui Zhong Tudi Gong from Baiji Fuxing Temple and 28 temples from the Daxi area to join. A total of 18 boats participated in a nearly three-hour lake pilgrimage at Shimen Reservoir to pray for blessings and rain. On April 14, Xiantian Temple in Dongshi, Chiayi County, held its first rain prayer ceremony in 300 years, burning 17 green dragons and 7,000 longevity gold papers on-site to petition the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas for rain to alleviate the drought. On April 17, residents of the Sun Moon Lake area initiated a rain prayer event, welcoming Mazu from the Tainan Zhengyi Luermen Mazu Temple. Participants carried Mazu statues around the lake, took boats, and rode cable cars, conducting a \"land, sea, and air\" pilgrimage to pray for rain. In Dalin Township, Chiayi County, Shengxian Temple held a \"Rain Prayer Grand Ceremony\" for Guan Sheng Dijun's return, with Chiayi County Magistrate Weng Chang-liang wearing traditional Han attire to lead the prayer. On April 18, Lingxiao Baodian Wulong Temple in Yongkang District, Tainan City, held a rain prayer ceremony led by 11 Taoist priests. Following ancient customs, they used four symbolic water jars representing divine beasts to conduct the ritual. On April 19, Yicheng Tang Guan Di Temple in Kaohsiung held a rain prayer ritual, inviting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai to serve as the chief officiant. The temple displayed the \"Thunder and Lightning Flag,\" symbolizing rain prayers, hoping to end the drought quickly. On April 25, Songshan Cihui Temple held a national protection and peace prayer ceremony, attended by Vice President Lai Ching-te and Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan, who prayed together for rain and water for Taiwan. On April 29, Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che conducted a rain prayer ritual at Anping Kaitai Tianhou Temple following ancient customs, presenting a \"Rain Petition Document\" and performing the ancient \"Shangyang Dance.\" Simultaneously, all 37 administrative districts in Tainan held rain prayer ceremonies at local temples, with district chiefs leading the rituals. From late May to early August, Taiwan experienced abundant rainfall, and reservoirs reached full capacity, ending the drought. After consulting through divination, Anping Kaitai Tianhou Temple sent the Shangyang back to the heavens at around 6 a.m. on August 7, with Mayor Huang Wei-che serving as the chief officiant."

                "content": "From the afternoon of April 28 to the morning of April 29, a relatively complete frontal rainband passed through Taiwan, bringing brief showers or thunderstorms to areas from central to northern Taiwan and the northeastern region, as well as brief showers or thunderstorms in the southern mountainous areas. This provided more abundant rainfall for counties and cities in central and northern Taiwan, with reservoirs receiving some inflow. As of 4 p.m. on April 29, the total rainfall across Taiwan was 15.97 million tons, equivalent to 1.5 days of water usage for the entire island. However, due to the rapid movement of this frontal system, significant relief from drought is still expected to come during the plum rain season.\n\nOn May 24-25, a frontal system approached Taiwan, with vigorous development of convective cloud systems, leading to short-term heavy rainfall in the afternoon across various regions. Not only did heavy rain fall in Taipei and New Taipei City, but localized heavy rain also occurred in the mountainous areas of Keelung, Yilan, northern Kaohsiung, and Hualien. This rainfall brought approximately 18.15 million tons of water to Taiwan, with the Feitsui Reservoir and Shimen Reservoir benefiting the most, positively impacting water conditions. However, southern reservoirs gained little from this rainfall and still faced water shortages. Nevertheless, the increased flow in the Gaoping River and the improved storage rate of Chengqing Lake eased water conditions in the Kaohsiung area, changing the water alert signal to a yellow light.\n\nFrom May 30 to June 1, a more complete plum rain front brought significant rainfall to Taiwan, resulting in positive growth in reservoir storage rates across the island. The estimated inflow to reservoirs nationwide was 136 million tons, equivalent to two weeks of water usage for the entire island. The Water Resources Agency estimated that the Shimen Reservoir in the north benefited the most, with an inflow of approximately 26 million tons. However, storage rates remained low, and several more rain events would be needed to fully alleviate the drought.\n\nFrom June 4 to June 6, Typhoon Choi-wan and a plum rain front brought abundant rainfall to Taiwan, easing water conditions. This plum rain front contributed approximately 210 million tons of rainfall to reservoir catchment areas across the island. The Feitsui Reservoir in Taipei received about 42 million tons, while the Shimen, Baoshan, and Baoshan Second Reservoirs collectively gained 16.56 million tons. In central Taiwan, the Yongheshan, Liyutan, and Deji Reservoirs collectively increased by 22.7 million tons. The Sun Moon Lake and Wushe Reservoirs in Nantou gained about 11 million tons, the Nanhua Reservoir in Tainan about 32.1 million tons, and the Zengwen and Wushantou Reservoirs about 41 million tons. This rainfall also allowed the red light water rationing measures in Taichung and northern Changhua to be lifted, with Changhua and Yunlin switching to green light water reminders, and Nantou and Kaohsiung returning to normal water conditions.\n\nFrom June 21 to June 25, a plum rain front lingered near Taiwan, bringing rainfall across the island. The Central Weather Bureau stated that the most significant impact of this stationary front occurred on June 22 and 23, with the main rainfall areas being the western half and northeastern regions. Meteorologist Wu Derong, reflecting on the soon-to-end plum rain season on June 25, noted that although three typical stationary plum rain fronts brought rainfall, without the additional two mobile fronts, consecutive afternoon thunderstorms, and the southwest monsoon delivering substantial rainfall to central and southern Taiwan, the record-breaking 56-year drought would not have been so easily alleviated.\n\nFrom July 23 to July 25, Typhoon In-Fa passed over the northeastern waters of Taiwan, prompting the Central Weather Bureau to issue a sea typhoon warning. Although Typhoon In-Fa did not make landfall in Taiwan, its outer circulation brought abundant rainfall to areas from central to northern Taiwan, with an estimated reservoir inflow benefit of approximately 330 million tons. This rainfall effectively replenished reservoirs in central and northern Taiwan, returning water conditions to normal in Taoyuan and Miaoli, and changing Taichung's water alert from an orange light for reduced water supply to a yellow light for reduced pressure water supply.\n\nFrom July 31 to August 1, Taiwan was affected by a southwest airflow, resulting in significant rainfall in areas south of Taichung. Rainfall accumulation reached 521 mm and 512.5 mm in Yuyoushan, Kaohsiung, and Dahan Mountain, Pingtung, respectively. Several towns experienced flooding and waterlogging, with some roads disrupted. The Central Weather Bureau named this event the \"110731 Southwest Airflow Heavy Rain Event.\" This heavy rain brought approximately 100 million tons of precipitation to Taiwan, with the Nanhua Reservoir and Zengwen Reservoir benefiting the most. Although the Deji and Wushe Reservoirs in the central mountainous region received rainfall, their recovery was slower.\n\nFrom August 6 to August 8, after Typhoon Lupit weakened into a tropical depression upon making landfall in Fujian Province, it turned and made landfall in Taiwan, bringing several days of disastrous heavy rain. From 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August 7, a total of over 2.3 billion tons of rainfall was recorded in just six hours."

Although the Taiwanese government has provided exceptional water allowances to semiconductor manufacturers to prevent major short-term impacts, the ongoing water shortage may force the water-intensive semiconductor industry to make adjustments. This could also lead to farmers, who urgently need water resources, being forced to abandon irrigation and leave their land barren due to water being prioritized for industrial zones. Due to climate change, water shortages may become a more persistent issue in the coming years."

                "content": "The Tokyo metropolitan area was not originally a land blessed with abundant water resources, and until the 1960s, Tokyo's water supply relied heavily on the Tama River system, including the Ogouchi Dam. However, the Tama River system had a limited catchment area, resulting in insufficient supply, and the Arakawa River system also had the drawback of being difficult to manage due to significant fluctuations in water volume. Particularly in postwar Tokyo, water demand surged at a pace far exceeding expectations due to various factors such as rapid population growth, the spread of water supply systems, increased industrial water demand driven by high economic growth, the proliferation of electric washing machines and flush toilets, urban sprawl, and unregulated development. Consequently, from 1958, Tokyo began to experience droughts almost annually. The water supply from the Yodobashi Water Purification Plant in the Tama River system had already reached its limit, and abnormal weather conditions from 1960 to 1962, with average rainfall less than half of normal levels, exacerbated the prolonged drought in the Tama River system, leading to chronic large-scale water shortages in Tokyo. Starting in October 1961, Tokyo implemented a 20% water supply restriction, which was intensified to 35% in July 1962. During this period, water was unavailable from taps between 10 PM and 5 AM, as well as from 10 AM to 4 PM, affecting not only households but also manufacturing industries that relied on industrial water. \n\nAs a countermeasure against water shortages, the Kanamachi Water Purification Plant for water intake from the Edogawa River was expanded in 1960, but this was far from solving the problem. In the spring of 1960, the government and the Liberal Democratic Party urgently established a Special Committee on Water Resource Measures. After inter-ministerial coordination, the Water Resources Development Corporation (now the Japan Water Agency) was established in May 1962 to comprehensively and systematically develop water resources on behalf of the government. Large-scale water resource development projects were initiated, such as connecting the Tone River and the Arakawa River via the Musashi Canal, to make the Tone River, with its wide basin area, a new major water source for Tokyo. However, the completion of the upstream dam group on the Tone River was not expected until 1967. To address the immediate crisis, construction of the Akigase Intake Weir and Asaka Canal for water intake from the Arakawa River began in November 1963. Additionally, in 1963, water intake from the Edogawa River was strengthened through the Edogawa System Expansion Project, and in 1964, surplus water from the Nakagawa River was diverted to the Edogawa River through the Nakagawa-Edogawa System Emergency Expansion Project, among other initiatives."

By summer, the total water storage of the Ogouchi Dam, Murayama Reservoir, and Yamaguchi Reservoir had dropped to 1.6% of their full capacity, and the lakebeds dried up and cracked. By July, the water shortage had reached an extremely critical level. On July 22, an emergency meeting on Tokyo's water shortage was held by the national government, the Water Resources Development Corporation, and Tokyo officials, concluding to expedite water supply from the Tone River. Additionally, Ichiro Kono, the minister in charge of the Olympics, ordered the completion of the Akigase Intake Weir to be moved up from October to the end of August, considering the global attention on Tokyo during the Olympics. Meanwhile, the Social and Labor Committee of the House of Representatives addressed the water shortage disaster, pursuing the authorities on a bipartisan basis as a \"humanitarian issue.\"\n\nAs the water shortage persisted into August, the government dispatched 25,000 Self-Defense Force personnel to assist, providing 7,000 cubic meters of emergency water supply to hospitals and households over 16 days using 215 water trucks. Additional support included water supply assistance from the Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. military, as well as an emergency water diversion of 100,000 cubic meters per day from Kanagawa Prefecture. Eventually, Tokyo's water supply restrictions were raised to 45%.\n\nFrom August 6, the fourth water supply restriction began in 17 wards of Tokyo, with water cut off for 15 hours a day. Pools and flush toilets were banned, and businesses such as barbershops, dry cleaners, ice makers, soba shops, sushi shops, and butcher shops were forced to close. Medical institutions could no longer perform surgeries and stopped seeing patients except for emergencies. Tokyo residents struggled with bathing, cooking, and laundry, mobilizing buckets, basins, and pots to secure water. People took days off work to wait for water trucks, collapsed from overwork while carrying water, experienced miscarriages, evacuated to areas with water, faced water theft, and fought over water, causing significant disruption to daily life. Newspapers frequently referred to the parched and dusty scenes in Tokyo as the \"Tokyo Desert.\"\n\nOn August 13, artificial rain experiments began with airplanes spraying water over the Ogouchi Dam. On August 15, the water-saving target was raised from 45% to 50%. On August 20, long-awaited heavy rain fell in the water source areas, and on August 25, the Akigase Intake Weir was finally completed after rushed construction, allowing water from the Arakawa River to be channeled to the Higashimurayama Water Purification Plant. This marked a turning point in the severe water shortage. Ultimately, the water supply restrictions lasted a total of 1,259 days (about three and a half years)."

Tokyo's water supply came to rely 80% on the Tone River and Arakawa River systems, significantly reducing the risk of water shortage disasters in Tokyo. Since then, a large-scale water shortage comparable to the great Tokyo drought of that time has not occurred in Tokyo."

This year is part of a much longer drought period that has lasted since 2008, with the driest year being 2019; this decade is the driest in all of Chilean history. Several lakes completely disappeared during the 2010s, notably the Laguna de Aculeo. In 2019, 34,000 animals died due to a lack of water. The retreat of Chile's glaciers is very significant. For instance, forecasts indicate that the Maipo River will see its flow decrease by forty percent between 2019 and 2070 due to the retreat of its originating glacier. It is, however, the source of supply for 80% of its watershed. Precipitation in the Chilean Andes decreases by thirty millimeters every ten years on average, leading to a reduction in glacier mass of between eight and fifteen billion tons. Between 2000 and 2020, 98% of Andean glaciers retreated, losing an average of one meter in thickness, with the Andes being the most affected mountain range in the world by glacier melting. In the southern Andes, the planimetric retreat can reach nearly nine kilometers, and the annual measured decrease exceeds one meter. Historical precedents have been recorded, notably the drought of 1924-1925, considered until then the worst in Chilean history, and that of 1967-1969, locally referred to as the \"silent earthquake.\" The latter is characterized by a precipitation deficit of more than 80% in the regions of Valparaiso and Bernardo O'Higgins; it caused the death of thousands of animals, the destruction of numerous fruit crops, and a water shortage affecting not only populations but also hydroelectric production."

Indeed, the country's Constitution explicitly states that water rights are treated as private property. The management of water resources is codified by the Water Code (es) dating back to 1981, during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Water is considered a tradable asset, and water allocations can therefore be sold and purchased under the control of the General Directorate of Water (es), \"Dirección General de Aguas.\" This entity grants \"water rights,\" which consist of a maximum annual volume of water pumped per year and a maximum instantaneous flow rate. However, after the resource is pumped from its natural source, it completely exits the control of the DGA and can be sold to anyone. The directorate only has authority over the upstream resource, which it can decide to close temporarily or permanently. Water rights follow market laws, and allocations are granted based on priority, on the one hand, and financial power, on the other, as the cost of the allocation is high. Acquired rights are also transferable as private property[1],[7]. Furthermore, the Constitution allows the State to grant third parties free and unlimited usage rights and does not define any priority use of water. In particular, consumption and domestic use are not legally prioritized over economic uses of the water resource. Aquifer management committees are provided for by regulations, but representation is proportional to extraction, which only benefits large users[4],[7]. One of the few actions available to authorities is the prohibition of aquifer usage rights, but this is only used as a last resort when levels are already very low due to overexploitation[8]. Indigenous populations in Chile are particularly dispossessed because they do not view water as a marketable commodity and therefore have not submitted applications for allocations[7]."

Indeed, during the 1990s, agro-food companies successively obtained rights to all the water from each of the lake's tributary rivers and extracted the majority of it. More broadly, 59% of the country's water resources are allocated to forestry and 37% to agriculture. The water supply for the population is covered by 2% of the available resource. The fruits cultivated thanks to the extraction of water resources are mainly avocados, grapes, and citrus fruits, primarily for export. Consequently, it is mainly the poorest rural populations, but also modest urban populations, who suffer the most from water shortages. Similarly, the extractive industry is also very water-intensive. Located in the extremely dry Atacama Desert, it nevertheless has underground aquifers buried beneath the salt flats, which it uses notably for the extraction of copper and lithium, the latter particularly in the Salar de Atacama."

In 2020, Chile ranked eighteenth globally for high water stress, according to the World Resources Institute. In April 2022, President Gabriel Boric signed a reform of the Water Code, making water a public good intended for human use and recognizing its impact by climate change. On September 4, 2022, the Chilean people were invited to vote on a new constitution. However, the adoption of this new constitution was rejected by a large majority."

The harvest was abundant, but in some places, the grapes had dried out, and the fermentation of the grape must left much to be desired. Overall, the vegetation development was consistently 4–5 weeks early. In the autumn, the cherry trees bloomed again. In November, in some places, the cherries ripened for the second time. In December, flowers bloomed in Basel at \"spring-like\" temperatures. The following winter of 1474 was again rainy without frost in eastern France, and the Baltic Sea became ice-free early. In Central Europe, the \"high mountains\" – presumably the peaks of the Black Forest at altitudes of 1200 to 1500 meters – remained without snow throughout the winter, as recorded by the Basel jurist Johannes Knebel in his diary.

The year 1473 marked the peak of several warm winters, springs, and hot-dry summers from 1471 to 1474. The drought of 1473 lasted longer than the drought of 1540 in Europe, covered a larger area, and affected several years with varying intensity, whereas the drought of 1540 was a relatively isolated climatic event. The multi-year heat surge in the early 1470s is unique during the European Little Ice Age from 1340 to around 1900. The Old World Drought Atlas, primarily based on tree ring data, confirms the nearly pan-European dimension of the 1473 drought. It was part of a transatlantic drought period that lasted from 1437 to 1473. In the southwestern part of today's USA, it was the worst in the last 1000 years. This extreme period is attributed to a hydroclimatic factor, possibly due to long-term changes in the surface temperature of the North Atlantic."

Scientists from Inpe indicated that the cause of this drought was the simultaneous occurrence of the El Niño phenomenon along with the warming of the tropical waters of the North Atlantic. A study published in the journal Science concluded that during the 2010 drought, the Amazon rainforest received 57% less rainfall than usual, while during the 2005 drought, there was 37% less rainfall. Another conclusion of the study was that carbon emissions in 2010 from the decomposition of dead vegetation in the forest were higher than those during the 2005 drought. In July 2023, scientists were already warning about the possibility of the El Niño phenomenon increasing wildfires in the Amazon region due to its influence on changes in Pacific Ocean temperatures and the disruption of the region's rainfall patterns."

In the state of Amazonas, rainfall ranged from 100 to 350 millimeters below normal, which corresponds to about half the expected volume for the area. On September 29, Governor Wilson Lima of Amazonas declared a state of emergency in 55 municipalities in the state for six consecutive months, in addition to determining actions to mitigate the effects of the drought. By early November, a state of emergency was declared for all 62 municipalities in the state. Along with the historic drought, the region faced a severe environmental emergency related to intense wildfires, which in October alone accounted for about 3,900, the worst scenario in the last 25 years. On October 6, the state government of Acre declared a state of emergency due to the abrupt reduction in the levels of the Acre, Purus, Juruá, Tarauacá, Envira, Iaco, and Moa rivers. In Pará, the drought mainly affected the western region of the state, where the level of the Tapajós River dropped to 55 centimeters (the lowest mark since the 2010 drought), but it also affected the southwestern and southeastern regions, as well as the Marajó region. In November, 24 municipalities in the state declared a state of emergency, while 21 municipalities had their emergency situation recognized by the Ministry of Integration and Regional Development. The Federal Government released about R$32 million to the state to combat the effects caused by the drought. On October 19, the Federal Government of Brazil recognized the emergency situation caused by the drought in the municipality of Tartarugalzinho, the first city in Amapá to enter a state of emergency. However, on November 22, the state government of Amapá extended the emergency decree to all its 16 municipalities due to the intense drought. In the state of Rondônia, only on December 15 was a state of emergency declared, which was instituted for the entire state along with a water crisis committee to mitigate the effects of the prolonged drought in the region. In Roraima, it was found on December 21 that the entire state region presented areas of moderate or severe drought according to the Drought Monitor of the National Water and Basic Sanitation Agency (ANA), marking the first time the state appeared in the survey. According to studies by the Laboratory of Terrestrial Climate System Modeling (Labclim) of the State University of Amazonas (UEA), rainfall in the state of Amazonas is expected to normalize only in February 2024."

The Rio Branco, located in the state of Roraima, recorded a level of 0.60 meters on November 29, the lowest level since 2016, when the El Niño phenomenon also affected the region. On December 21, the level dropped to 0.44 meters. On the same date the previous year, it had recorded a level of 3.11 meters. The low level of the Rio Madeira caused the Santo Antônio Hydroelectric Plant in Rondônia to halt operations for two weeks (from October 2 to 16). This was the second time in history that the plant had to suspend its operations, and in 2022 it had achieved the fourth-largest electricity production in Brazil."

On October 11, the World Air Quality Index (WAQI), which measures levels of particulate matter and pollutant gases such as ozone and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of cities worldwide, indicated that the city of Manaus was the second city with the worst air quality on the entire planet. According to Ibama, these events were due to fires occurring in the Metropolitan Region of Manaus. The smoke extended until the month of November, when a sandstorm also occurred in the Amazonian capital, caused by wind gusts on the dried-out ground, raising large amounts of dust and dirt."

                "content": "In some regions of the states of Amazonas and Pará, water temperatures above expected averages were identified. Fish and reptiles, being ectothermic, have difficulty surviving when they reach certain body temperature limits, in addition to the fact that warmer waters show a reduction in dissolved oxygen concentration, which can lead some animals to death. An example of this was Lake Janauacá (near Manaus), which during the 2023 drought recorded temperatures between 31.8°C and 38°C, oxygen concentration close to 0.38 mg/L (Conama's resolution establishes that the limit value for the preservation of aquatic life is 5.0 mg/L) and, consequently, a series of dead fish, alligators, and even turtles. In Lake Tefé, 521 kilometers from Manaus, a total of 159 pink river dolphins and tucuxis died from September to the end of 2023. During this period, temperatures of up to 41°C were observed in certain parts of the lakes, in addition to record air temperatures in nearby municipalities. Furthermore, about 117 of these same animals were found dead in the city of Coari, near Tefé. The Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBIO) suspects that the drought in the region may have contributed to these occurrences. According to climatologist Carlos Nobre, collected data demonstrate that the Amazon rainforest is being rapidly destroyed due to the combination of drought and fires, predicting an increase of up to 300% in tree mortality. A study coordinated by Dr. Cristhiana Paula Röpke from Inpa, with support from the Amazonas State Research Support Foundation (Fapeam), found that the drought led to a reduction in fish diversity and an increase in dominant species relative to the total number of individuals. The climatic phenomenon affected fish movement, access to food, and indications of when to reproduce."

                "content": "There were significant economic impacts in the state of Amazonas, especially due to the difficulty in transporting production from the Manaus Industrial Hub, fish deaths, and a reduction in tourism in the region. Some areas, such as the Tumbira Community in the Rio Negro Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS), where about 70% of the economy is focused on community-based tourism, suffered severe economic losses. According to the Institute for Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Amazon (IDESAM), community-based tourism, pirarucu management, and timber forest management were severely impacted during the crisis caused by the drought in the Amazon region. In the Ituxí Extractive Reserve (municipality of Lábrea), located in southern Amazonas, where pirarucu management is one of the main sources of income, a high mortality rate of this fish species was reported. Additionally, the difficulty in transporting products left local merchants and producers without alternatives during the river drought period, forcing local leaders to stockpile food for the long term. Due to the intense drought, combined with an increase in product demand, about 33 companies in the Manaus Free Trade Zone had to bring forward collective vacations to October, which usually occurred at the beginning of December. According to the president of the metalworkers' union of Amazonas, between 15,000 and 17,000 workers were laid off earlier than expected. According to IBGE data, industrial production in Amazonas fell by 5.7% in October compared to the same period the previous year. In November, compared to the previous month, industrial production dropped by 4.2%. On an annual comparison, the state's production decreased by 10.3% in November 2023. The Amazonas industry also incurred over R$1.4 billion in additional costs due to the lack of inputs and difficulty in transporting final products. Furthermore, there was an 83% drop in imports via the waterway mode in the state due to the historic drought. In western Pará, fish mortality affected more than 33,000 fishermen, who were left without a source of income when the region's rivers and lakes dried up. The economic impact on this population was so significant that the federal government provided two minimum wage payments as defeso insurance for the affected population."

In the municipality of Lábrea, in southern Amazonas, about 90% of the villages suffer losses in food, health, and transportation due to the dry season. In the Jarawara/Jamamadi/Kanamati Indigenous Land, the drought in the Purus River basin affected 10 villages due to the impossibility of transporting students, the entry of health teams, and especially fishing activities. In the Caititu Indigenous Land, the occurrence of fires caused the death of animals, destruction of crops, and health problems for the territory's inhabitants. Munduruku villages in the Kwatá-Laranjal Indigenous Land, living near the Canumã River bed (a tributary of the Madeira River), had to dig wells to obtain water during the dry season, faced difficulties in transporting people and goods in the region, affecting their livelihood. In the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, where 93% of the population identifies as indigenous, the drought affected indigenous villages that rely on fishing and farming, as there was a significant fish die-off, worsening water quality, energy rationing, and school closures. In the city of Tefé (Amazonas), the riverside population faced difficulties obtaining drinking water as the streams dried up completely and turned into overheated sandbanks. Thus, the population had to fetch water from the city and carry it over long distances to their homes. Additionally, in the same municipality, sections of the Solimões River dried up completely starting in September 2023, forming large sandbanks and affecting the lives of Kokama, Ticuna, and Maioruna indigenous peoples in the Porto Praia de Baixo Indigenous Land. The difficulty of accessing the territory due to the drought hindered fishing and the journey to the city, which indigenous peoples use to sell their products. In the Murutinga/Tracajá Indigenous Land, in the municipality of Autazes near Manaus, the river almost completely disappeared along the village's banks, affecting the supply of drinking water, making transportation difficult, and causing fish deaths, impacting more than 3,000 people. In the municipality of Beruri (Amazonas), in one of the curves of the Purus River, two people died and three others went missing due to the formation of a crater worsened by the intense drought. Furthermore, the accident in Vila Arumã (formed by a riverside community) destroyed about 45 homes, a health post, a school, and three churches. The crater formed on September 30 due to an erosive process exacerbated by illegal deforestation in the region and the drought, as trees have the capacity to maintain soil integrity, which, when it dries very abruptly as it did in 2023, increases pressure on the riverbed and intensifies the effect of \"fallen lands\" (natural collapse of riverbank slopes). Nine leaders of indigenous communities in Roraima reported suffering from water shortages, vegetation death (affecting livestock feeding), and cassava crops that are not being harvested in the necessary quantity and quality for the production of flour, beiju, starch, and other traditional foods."

The severity of the river level reduction this time exposed more carvings than the previous drought and even a human feature carved into rock. The site, which includes a beach covered with stone slabs, is located on the banks of the Negro River and covers an area of approximately 150,000 square meters. According to archaeologists from Iphan, the carvings, whose estimated age is between two thousand and one thousand years, are testimonies to the way of life of pre-colonial peoples who inhabited the Manaus region. Three other previously unknown archaeological sites were revealed by the drought that occurred in 2023. These bring historical records and more information about the way of life of the peoples who inhabited the region during the pre-colonial period. One of them is the Forte São Francisco Xavier, located on the banks of the Solimões River in the municipality of Tabatinga (Amazonas), near the tri-border area with Peru and Colombia. The fort, which was buried and submerged due to land collapses, was built with thick wood and has an irregular hexagonal shape. According to Iphan, the fort marks Portuguese dominance in the Amazon region during the colonial era and was the last stop for those heading to the Andes. In the city of Anamã (Amazonas), another archaeological site called Costa do Goiabeira was found, where ceramic funerary urns were discovered. Another discovery occurred in the municipality of Urucará (Amazonas), where new rock carvings were found, similar to those seen at the Ponta das Lajes site."

From August to October, precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and areas south of it was about 90% less than usual, resulting in severe to extreme summer-autumn consecutive droughts. Temperatures in August were 2 to 4 degrees Celsius higher than usual, with some areas 4 to 6 degrees higher, and the abnormal high temperatures covered the severely drought-affected regions.

                "content": "Since the 1990s, the agro-export industry has grown significantly, increasing the demand for water for crops that require large amounts of this resource, such as avocados. This claim is emphatically denied by representatives of the area's agro-industry, whose business representatives argue that avocados consume less water than other species, attributing the scarce water availability to the \"lack of state investment in reservoir and irrigation infrastructure.\" The water crisis has had a devastating impact on the communities of Petorca. Many families have lost access to drinking water and are forced to rely on water trucks for supply, which represents a significant cost and an additional burden in their lives. Additionally, the lack of water has affected family farming, which used to be a source of livelihood and trade for the region's inhabitants. Since 2006, rainfall in the area has not reached normal yearly levels, affecting the available flows for human consumption and agricultural use. In 2010, MODATIMA emerged, an organization dedicated to defending the right to water access for farmers, workers, and residents of the Petorca province. Due to the reduction of flow in the Petorca, La Ligua, and Aconcagua river basins, on November 24, 2010, the Ministry of Public Works declared a water emergency for these valleys in the Valparaíso region. On February 9, an agricultural emergency was declared in seven communes of the Valparaíso region: La Ligua, Petorca, Cabildo, Zapallar, Papudo, Putaendo, and Nogales. In 2014, the National Institute of Human Rights issued a report on the water crisis, where up to 65 illegal drainage works were found diverted for avocado cultivation. In 2016, during the administration of Governor Mario Fuentes Romero in Michelle Bachelet's second government, the province of Petorca was declared a water scarcity zone. This allowed for the provision of water truck services to deliver water to the population. As a long-term solution, it was proposed to direct water from the Aconcagua and Maipo rivers, among other measures. In 2017, only 4,763 hectares of avocado trees were surveyed in the basin, a 45% decrease compared to 2008. In 2018, 4,778 people had to receive drinking water supply via water trucks. Sebastián Piñera's second government implemented strict control of wells from which water is extracted, the formation and empowerment of Vigilance Boards among farmers to monitor and demand compliance with the law, and allocated a budget of $173,000,000 for the construction of the Las Palmas reservoir with a capacity of 55 million cubic meters, set to begin operations in 2024. Another less advanced project is the construction of the Pedernal reservoir with 31 million cubic meters for the irrigation of 1,800 hectares. In Los Quinquelles, a coastal area of the La Ligua commune, a desalination plant has been built. In 2020, the water scarcity in the La Ligua and Petorca areas was addressed in the episode \"Avocado Wars\" of the Netflix series Rotten."

In the new forest stand, pine accounts for only 74 percent, birch for as much as 18 percent, and oak and larch for 2 percent each. This is the most species-diverse fragment of the forest stand in the Noteć Forest. Along the railway tracks, 8-meter-wide firebreaks (devoid of vegetation) were created, as well as biological safety strips 50 to 100 meters wide, covered exclusively with deciduous species – resistant to fire. Deciduous tree strips were also created across the entire area of the former burned site; they divide it into many sections, serving as natural barriers to potential fires. In the area of the restored forest, no further than 1.5 kilometers apart, tanks with a capacity of 40–60 thousand liters were installed (each can supply about 20 firefighting vehicles). Natural terrain depressions, where water appeared, were also deepened, creating nine water reservoirs."

The meteorological conditions were extremely favorable for the fire - temperatures above 32°C were recorded on August 30 in Kalisz and 38°C in Łódź. There was a strong southern wind. A mountain wind was blowing in the Tatra Mountains, and the humidity of forest litter was extremely low. The possible cause of ignition was a spark from the train's braking wheels. The fire was extinguished only four days later and completely put out by September 12. The massive use of PZL-Mielec M-18 Dromader aircraft[3] dropping water at the fire's front played a significant role in the firefighting process. Additionally, about 1,100 fire trucks, helicopters, 50 railway tankers, and 6 locomotives, as well as heavy equipment such as engineering tanks, plows, and bulldozers, participated in the firefighting operation. In total, about 10,000 people were involved in the firefighting operation.[4] The destruction in the forest areas of Rudy Raciborskie, Rudziniec, and Kędzierzyn had the characteristics of an ecological disaster. Two people lost their lives in the fire: firefighter Andrzej Kaczina from the Fire Service Headquarters in Racibórz, who was posthumously promoted to the rank of chief, and his friend Andrzej Malinowski from the volunteer fire service in Kuźnia Raciborska. Fifty people were hospitalized, and about 2,000 were slightly injured and received assistance on-site. Fifteen fire trucks and 26 mechanical pumps were burned. The fire's hot ash destroyed 70 kilometers of fire hoses. A total of 9,062 hectares burned, 6,212 hectares in the then Katowice Voivodeship and 2,850 hectares in the then Opole Voivodeship. Buildings and production units were not damaged.[4] Since 1993, in August, a two-day memorial has been held for Kaczina and Malinowski - initially a cycling race, later an international wrestling competition combined with mass sports events, a two-day festival, and star concerts to honor the firefighters who lost their lives in the fight against the fire."

It raged from the end of June 1960 in the Tuntsa wilderness in the northern parts of the Salla municipality and even more extensively on the Soviet Union's side. The fire likely started from a lightning strike, and its spread was facilitated by the hot summer. There were two fire areas on the Finnish side: in the Papuoiva–Puitsi–Peuratunturi area and another in the Kuskoiva–Nuolusoiva area. Nearly 500 men were involved in extinguishing the fire in Finland. On the Finnish side, the fire destroyed about 20,000 hectares, while on the Soviet side, the fire area was approximately 100,000 hectares. About half of the burned area on the Finnish side was actual forest land, while the rest consisted of sparsely forested barren and wastelands as well as treeless fell areas. The forestry-related damages caused by the fire were ultimately minor, but the fire disrupted the region's reindeer husbandry by destroying the best winter pastures for reindeer. After the fire, a large-scale \"Tuntsa soot logging\" operation was organized to salvage the remaining timber in the area. The logging operation was the largest in Europe and at its peak employed a thousand people and hundreds of tractors. During the logging operation, which continued until 1967, a total of about 300,000 cubic meters of wood was salvaged from the burned area. For the first time, a grapple machine was tested in timber harvesting, and chainsaws were also widely adopted during the operation. After the timber harvesting, efforts were made to regenerate the Tuntsa fire area forest through sowing and planting, but this was only partially successful, and part of the burned area remained permanently treeless. The traces of both the fire and the timber harvesting are still visible in the area. There is also a dense road network, originally built for the soot logging operation."

In total, it burned more than 19,612 hectares of forest and agricultural land across 21 municipalities in the Alt Empordà. The Albera mountain range was completely devastated, and the fire involved the crash of one of the firefighting planes, resulting in the death of its four occupants and contributing to the spread of the fire. It is unknown whether the fire was intentional or not, though negligence is suspected. The fire started between the Coll de Panissars and El Pertús and reached as far as Cadaqués, Roses, and Figueres. It did not penetrate the Empordà wetlands because a small fire that had occurred a week earlier had burned the area and acted as a firebreak. The tramuntana wind — which reached speeds of over 120 km/h at times — contributed to the fire's spread southward. Throughout the period, the fire had more than 80 active fire points, and the firefighting efforts were overwhelmed by the scale of the tragedy. The weather conditions for the fire's spread were very unfavorable, and there were other simultaneous fires in Catalonia. This meant that, despite the involvement of around 60 ground vehicles, 400 firefighters, and Spanish and French firefighting planes, the resources dedicated to extinguishing the fire were very limited, allowing the fire to spread almost freely for much of the time."

Nevertheless, the assistance of French water bombers, which dampened the track area to allow firefighters to reach the plane, contributed to recovering the bodies and returning to France via the same route. Meanwhile, and without knowledge of the French firefighters' recovery of the bodies, a judicial and forensic team from Figueres, accompanied by the Spanish Civil Guard, approached the site to also retrieve the victims' bodies. However, they found that the bodies were no longer there, and the route they had taken was surrounded by flames. The convoy of vehicles they were traveling in—a Renault 4, a Seat 127, a funeral car, and another judicial vehicle—had to follow a very rough track and exit through Le Perthus, in Northern Catalonia and under French jurisdiction.

For a few years, a forest track was established for exclusive access by off-road vehicles to hold commemorations. Later, however, the area became covered by regenerated oak forests after the fire, and various parts and debris from the plane, such as the last remaining propeller until 2016, were looted. The site where the aircraft is located became a tourist attraction for hiking and a regular route for geocaching enthusiasts."

The fire claimed no human lives but destroyed or damaged 64 buildings—more than any other fire in Norway since 1945. 23 of the buildings were residential houses or holiday homes. The fire lasted until midday on January 29. King Harald visited Flatanger three days after the fire. The utility company NTE was acquitted in the compensation case. The fire scorched approximately 15 km², making it the largest in Norway since the forest fire in Froland in 2008. The fire caused damages amounting to around 150 million kroner. The Flatanger fire was one of three very large fires in Norway during the winter of 2014. Both these three and many smaller fires occurred after a prolonged (and for the season extreme) drought period, including in Lærdal and Frøya. 500 people participated in the firefighting and rescue efforts, including personnel from 21 fire stations and neighboring municipalities. Two Coast Guard vessels, five helicopters, and a rescue boat were deployed. The Ministry of Justice concluded that the fire services in Flatanger, Lærdal, and Frøya handled the fires well. Following these major fires, the DSB initiated larger units and cooperation between municipalities on fire and rescue services. After the 2014 fire, the leadership of the fire service in Flatanger was transferred to Namsos, while the personnel remain in Flatanger."

Instead, the low-pressure systems remained roughly over Great Britain. This led to easterly to southeasterly winds over most of Norway. As a result, Western Norway, Trøndelag, and Northern Norway were in the rain shadow, and in many places, January was the driest on record. In Trondheim, the relative humidity was measured at 33% on January 26. Flatanger received only 2 mm of precipitation in the last three weeks before the fire. Additionally, the ground was snow-free after an unusually mild period early in the month. In many places, the dry wind was very strong, with gales and occasionally small storms in exposed areas. This is not extreme for this part of the Norwegian coast, but the strongest winds usually come from the southwest to northwest. Furthermore, offshore winds are often more uneven and turbulent, as was the case here."

In January 2014, the fire department responded to 14 grass and heath fires in Nord-Trøndelag alone. Most of these fires were extinguished before causing significant damage. The most serious was a grass fire covering 100–200 decares, where a farm sawmill was lost. Flatanger experienced a heath fire the day before the disaster: an approved heath burning got out of control on Aspøya. The fire department allowed the fire to advance in the main direction, where it was stopped by the sea, and where no buildings were at risk. At the end of January, the grass and forest fire danger was very high along the entire west coast from Nord-Rogaland to Nord-Trøndelag. Such were the conditions in Flatanger when the fire broke out."

According to NRK, the fire started when a power line fell onto the dry ground near Uran and sparked. It was discovered by Odd Uran, who was part of the local fire department in Hasvåg. The emergency center in Namsos was alerted at 10:18 PM, and the police at 10:24 PM. A strong southeasterly gale, 20 m/s, and nearly a small storm were blowing. The wind was also uneven and constantly changing direction. The gusts were so violent that the firefighting crews occasionally had to lie down during the extinguishing efforts. The smoke development was so intense that the 25 firefighters could not get ahead of the fire. Neither Askfjellet nor County Road 492 could stop the fire. Thus, it spread very quickly. By 11:10 PM, the fire chief drove from Uran to evacuate the three locations of Håstad and Hasvåg in the northwest and Småværet further west. Reinforcements were called in. By 12:30 AM on the 28th, the residents had been evacuated without injuries, but 139 of 213 buildings were threatened. Within 12 hours of the fire breaking out, 63 buildings had been lost in the three locations – most between 4:00 AM and 6:00 AM. The fire department – with support from many volunteers – established a firebreak to prevent further spread. A 100–150 m wide belt of vegetation was sprayed. At its peak, approximately 250 firefighters from 21 fire and rescue services, 167 from the Civil Defense, and an unknown number of volunteers operated along the frontlines in Flatanger. Five helicopters were requisitioned, but the strong wind initially kept them grounded. The cold created difficulties in maintaining consistent pressure in the hoses and also caused icing. The variable wind was not only damaging. It also spared many houses as the wind suddenly blew the flames in another direction. In some places, the fire's advance stopped because it reached burned-out areas or the sea. The firebreak also held. Hårnes, at the easternmost point of the peninsula, was spared, and inland – towards the southeast – the fire faced headwinds and was stopped. Of the 29 buildings in Uran, only an outbuilding was lost. The fire also failed to jump over the fjords separating the peninsula from the mainland and several smaller islands. And as the day progressed, the wind began to subside. At 10:15 PM, the police reported that the fire was under control, and at 12:15 PM on the 29th – around the same time the firefighting helicopters were deployed – it was declared extinguished. The forest fire helicopter could then be moved to Frøya, where a new, intense heath fire had broken out. The Flatanger fire flared up again on the evening of the 29th – and one last time on February 1, when the settlement in Hasvåg was again threatened. The Civil Defense was called out for the second time. Around 90 buildings had been lost, the police said at a press conference on the afternoon of the 28th. Others feared that over 100 buildings had been lost. The damage turned out to be less than initially feared. Nevertheless, 64 buildings were lost – more than in the Lærdal fire and any other fire in Norway since 1945."

Several eyewitnesses could confirm that at the point of origin, a live, uninsulated wire had fallen down. This had caused a short circuit, and sparks had ignited the vegetation. The fire was just one of many heath and grass fires that occurred along the coast in the winter of 2014. Several of them were caused by carelessness with fire, despite warnings of very high fire danger. The Flatanger fire was barely extinguished before a similar fire broke out on Frøya, just west of Sistranda. This location was not threatened, as the strong wind was still southeasterly. The fire spread even faster towards the west and northwest. As a result, several settlements were threatened, and just under 200 people were evacuated. However, by establishing a firebreak, based on two ice-covered lakes, the fire department, with support from volunteers, managed to save this settlement."

                "content": "Both the fire in Lærdal and the Flatanger fire showed that under unfortunate circumstances, even a modern fire department cannot prevent a fire from spreading from house to house. And this applies not only to old wooden housing where the houses are closely packed but also to regular villa housing and sparsely populated areas. Several pointed out the need for more knowledge about fires of this type. Research leader Anne Steen-Hansen at SINTEF called for an accident investigation commission for fires. She believed that fires under extremely dry conditions were a relatively new phenomenon in Norway and that we should learn from countries with more experience in such situations, such as Australia, California, and countries in Southern Europe. In Sweden, the technical research institute SP warned about the lack of such knowledge throughout the Nordic region. SP also believed that climate change could contribute to a greater risk of fires."

The fire occurred when sparks from improperly handled defective TNT during a disposal process at a nearby army shooting range spread due to strong winds. The fire resulted in 140 displaced people from 49 households and caused a total damage of approximately 22.7 billion won. Currently, the affected area is managed by the National Institute of Forest Science under the Korea Forest Service and is divided into natural restoration zones and artificial afforestation zones for ecosystem restoration and related research."

At 2:30 PM, Deputy Governor Sim Woo-seok requested full support of the Korea Forest Service helicopters, but due to dry weather, wildfires also broke out simultaneously in Pyeongchang, Yanggu, and Inje, causing delays in deployment. At 3:10 PM, the first Korea Forest Service helicopter arrived and began firefighting efforts. Although additional military helicopters and fire trucks were continuously deployed, significant difficulties were encountered in extinguishing the fire. Around 8:30 PM, another wildfire broke out near the northern boundary line of Gohyangbong in Myeongpari, Hyeonnae-myeon, Goseong-gun, burning 120 hectares of forest. The fire was successfully extinguished by 5 PM on the 24th. Part of the facilities at the Unification Observatory was damaged by the fire."

Around 2 a.m., as the fire spread, the emergency response headquarters was relocated to the Jukwang-myeon office. Additionally, the fire spread to the northern parking lot of Songjiho Beach, burning the communication cables connecting Sokcho and Goseong along the mountain ridge. As a result, long-distance phone calls were disrupted for 14 hours. The flames, carried by northwesterly winds, spread along the coast and southward to Unbong, Hakya, and Dowon-ri in Toseong-myeon. From 10 a.m., military authorities began restricting tourist access. Furthermore, the emergency response headquarters urgently evacuated 162 residents from farms in Injeong-ri, Sampori, and Unbong Hakya-ri, areas expected to be affected by the wildfire. The wildfire occurred simultaneously across a wide area, making it difficult to extinguish with a limited number of helicopters. Additionally, fallen leaves reignited embers, causing significant challenges. The fire spread both northward and southward from the ignition point, burning most of Jukwang-myeon overnight. To make matters worse, strong winds of 30 meters per second accelerated the spread of the fire. Around 11:15 p.m., concerns arose among residents that the wildfire in Tapdong, Ganseong-eup, could spread to nearby areas, leading to a suggestion to set a backfire. With the help of the fire department, a backfire was set."

The countermeasure headquarters evacuated 27 households, approximately 80 residents, from nearby villages such as Dowon-ri, Hakya 2-ri, and Seonyusil-ri to relatives' homes, military barracks, and senior centers. In the morning, President Kim Young-sam called Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung, instructing him to visit the wildfire site to oversee firefighting efforts, assess the damage, support recovery, and address public concerns. At 2:30 PM, Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung arrived in the Tapdong area to inspect the fire situation, and Kangwon Governor Choi Gak-kyu requested the Prime Minister to declare the affected area a special disaster zone. Additionally, the government was advised to provide rural housing loan support for residents whose homes were destroyed by the fire. The countermeasure headquarters mobilized 4,000 people, including military personnel and local residents, along with 25 helicopters, to the areas around Dowon-ri in Toseong-myeon near Seoraksan National Park and Tapdong-ri in Ganseong-eup, successfully containing the major flames by around 4:20 PM. By 6:10 PM, all helicopters involved in the firefighting efforts had withdrawn, and the countermeasure headquarters officially announced the completion of the firefighting operation. To prevent rekindling, 170 public officials and 15 fire trucks were deployed to vulnerable areas for monitoring."

In particular, the forest area around Tapdong-ri in Ganseong-eup and Dowon-ri in Toseong-myeon, which suffered severe fire damage, was a place where a large amount of wild pine mushrooms were produced, but the fire destroyed an important source of income for the residents. On April 28, a joint investigation by the Korea Forest Service and the Accident Countermeasure Headquarters predicted that it would take at least 40 years to a maximum of 100 years to restore the severely damaged soil in the forest area. It was estimated that an area three times the officially burned area, reaching 10,000 hectares, was ecologically damaged due to the disruption of the food chain and the inability of seeds to spread. The burned area lost its carbon dioxide absorption function, and the ecological corridor connecting the Civilian Control Line and Seoraksan Mountain was expected to be severed for decades."

According to the Ministry of National Defense, the incident occurred during the process of detonating 525 defective TNTs by Sergeant Jeong Jae-seok of this unit. Regulations required that the signal kits be removed in advance and all TNTs be incinerated, but Sergeant Jeong Jae-seok dug a 60cm hole at the shared firearms shooting range located at San 33, Majwa-ri, placed the TNT inside, and detonated it. As a result, the signal kits near the pit were launched, and the sparks were carried by strong winds, spreading to the upper valley forest and other areas. The Army arrested Sergeant Jeong Jae-seok, who was the unit's explosive disposal team leader at the time, on charges of arson. Simultaneously, Major Shin Yu-seung, the battalion commander, was relieved of his position, and Colonel Jeong Jae-ho, the commander of the 8th Logistics Support Command, was referred to the military disciplinary committee. However, even within the Ministry of National Defense, there was criticism that ending the disciplinary action for the worst-recorded disaster with just one non-commissioned officer was excessively lenient considering public sentiment. Additionally, the Army rejected broadcasting companies' helicopter operation requests to film the wildfire situation, citing regulatory restrictions, leading to criticism that their punishment was passive while their efforts to prevent disclosure of the truth were active."

                "content": "The causes of the wildfire not being contained for three days and the significant increase in damage were pointed out to be strong winds, dry weather, rugged terrain, lack of equipment, and shortage of professional personnel. The initial strong winds caused the fire to spread faster, with the wind direction constantly changing and the dry weather making it easier for the fire to spread, complicating efforts to determine the direction of containment. Most of the fire occurred in rugged terrain that was difficult for people to access, so the majority of the containment efforts had to rely on helicopters, which proved ineffective despite the deployment of many personnel. Additionally, Gangwon Province did not have a single helicopter dedicated to wildfire containment, and the available equipment was rudimentary, only suitable for extinguishing residual fires. Over 10,000 personnel were deployed, but only about 2,000 were professionally trained in firefighting. This led to criticism that sufficient budget allocation is necessary for disaster prevention efforts to contain large-scale wildfires. There was also an analysis that the lack of a rapid response system for initial containment exacerbated the situation. Although the Forest Service was requested to provide helicopter support, it took 1 hour and 30 minutes for the helicopters to arrive at the site. Furthermore, even if a fire broke out near a military shooting range, the risk of unexploded ordnance exploding made it difficult to approach, and cooperation from the military was required to carry out containment efforts, highlighting the lack of conditions for quickly extinguishing the fire. Residents criticized that the administrative authorities had left pine trees, which were thinned out for reasons such as removing pine wilt disease, abandoned in the mountains, resulting in the fire spreading quickly to these trees and causing greater damage. Additionally, after the fire broke out, the military did not issue an evacuation broadcast for 13 hours, which residents claimed worsened the damage. Similarly, residents and public officials who participated in the containment efforts expressed dissatisfaction that the military did not respond promptly, exacerbating the situation, and demanded that all those responsible for the wildfire be arrested."

The next day, the government held a meeting of relevant ministries at the Government Complex to prepare comprehensive measures for wildfire prevention and decided to provide state compensation to residents of affected areas, as the wildfire was revealed to be caused by the Ministry of National Defense's negligence. Additionally, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries was designated as the central body to lead the \"Goseong Wildfire Central Accident Response Headquarters,\" which would investigate the cause of the fire and assess the scale of the damage. A joint investigation team from relevant ministries was dispatched to the site that day to conduct a detailed investigation into property and forest damage and decided to provide special support to affected farmers, including rice seeds, farming materials, and agricultural funds. The Army also issued orders to mobilize all personnel and equipment from its subordinate units to assist in the recovery of the affected areas. Gangwon Province deferred the collection of property taxes, urban planning taxes, comprehensive land taxes, and local taxes for residents of the affected areas for six months. On June 19 of the same year, the Ministry of Environment announced plans to establish an ecological restoration test site to observe the natural recovery process over 50 to 100 years in areas burned by the wildfire that did not impact residents' economic activities. The natural restoration sites were created in two locations in Goseong County, Guseong-ri and Injeong-ri, with areas of 30 hectares and 70 hectares, respectively. According to a report in April 1997, the Korea Forest Service devised a reforestation plan to expedite the collection of pine mushrooms by residents. However, due to the tight reforestation schedule, it became difficult to procure saplings, leading to the decision to supply fast-growing trees cultivated in greenhouses, which drew criticism from several forestry experts."

                "content": "In April 1997, 316 residents of Goseong County filed a class-action lawsuit against the state, demanding compensation for damages related to activities such as pine mushroom harvesting. On August 15 of the same year, the 8th Corps District Compensation Review Committee ruled that compensation was dismissed because the fire starter was a civilian who had conducted shooting range facility construction, making the State Compensation Act inapplicable. On December 3, 1998, the Seoul District Court issued a compulsory mediation decision, ordering the state to pay approximately 8.4 billion won to the residents regarding the class-action lawsuit from April of the previous year. As of April 2005, nine years after the fire, natural restoration sites established in two locations in Goseong County showed much higher plant weight and density compared to artificial afforestation sites. However, many areas still had poor soil, and vegetation was sparse, indicating that it would take about 10 more years to restore the appearance of a typical forest. According to a study by the National Institute of Forest Science under the Korea Forest Service in June 2009, 16 species of wild birds were observed in areas affected by the wildfire, recovering to 80% of the 20 species observed in unaffected surrounding areas. As of an April 2010 report, the growth of pine trees in afforestation areas continued after the wildfire damage, but oak trees growing in natural restoration areas showed severe discoloration and cavity phenomena. As of May 2015, most of the pine forests that existed before the incident had disappeared, and broadleaf trees such as oak, sawtooth oak, and azalea, as well as shrubs, had grown to a height of 2–3 meters. On the opposite side of the restoration site, an artificial afforestation area managed by the Yangyang National Forest Management Office of the Eastern Regional Forest Service was established. It consisted of single species such as pine and birch trees and succeeded to some extent in forming a forest. However, due to the wildfire, the soil's capacity had declined, and the height of the pine trees was found to be only 41–71.9% compared to average trees."

These were referred to as \"the largest grassland fires in Iceland's history.\" It is believed that the fire was ignited by a cigarette near Route 54 opposite Bretavatn. The fire spread very quickly, covering about 18 kilometers in the first six hours. The burned area was located between Routes 54, 540, and 537, except for one strip that extended south of Route 537. At its peak, the fire wall was up to two meters high and moved at a speed of tens of meters per minute. The fires were extinguished through extensive firefighting efforts by local residents, the Borgarbyggð fire department, assistance from neighboring municipalities, and a helicopter from the Helicopter Service. No damage occurred to structures, except for fences, but many farms were very close to being consumed by the fire. The farm Hamrar was only a few meters away from the fire at one point. The fires had a significant impact on the area's ecosystem, as the burned area was one of the largest continuous wetlands in the country, making it more accurate to describe the event as a natural disaster rather than an ordinary grassland fire.

At the time, there was a NNE wind at 13 m/s. The weather in the country had been extremely dry and cold. A cold northerly wind had been characteristic of the last 10 days of March and the first days of April, with strong winds prevailing most of the time. It was very dry in the southern part of the country, while there was snowfall in the northern and eastern regions. Due to the dryness, the vegetation in Mýrar was highly flammable, making it easy for the fire to take hold in the grass that forms under such conditions. Cotton grass, bilberry shrubs, and dwarf birch are widespread in Mýrar, and large areas of this vegetation burned in the Mýrar fires."

By that time, the grass fire had begun to slow down, and farms north of the burned area, Fíflholt, Einholt, Stóri-Kálfalækur, and Akrar, were out of the greatest danger. Farms near the sea were not in significant danger, thanks to favorable conditions. However, it was clear that farms southeast of the area were in significant danger. During the night of March 31, the fire had spread slightly westward, but it had not yet approached the main road. This was due to good weather conditions, as there was little wind during the night. Around 10 a.m., the wind picked up again and shifted to a northerly direction. The fire then crossed Sauravegur road no. 537 over a stretch of about one kilometer, north of the farm Hamrar.

The organization of the firefighting was good; slurry tankers were used where the fire was most intense, and in addition to extinguishing the fires, the fire brigade also played an advisory role in this regard. The fire brigade was mainly stationed at Skíðsholt, trying to protect residential buildings, but at that time, there was no perceived risk of the fire spreading to other houses. During the night of March 31, the fire spread only slightly, and roads were then wetted with manure and sand.[15] By the morning of March 31, twelve farms had burned. The fire brigade had by then received assistance from companies in Borgarnes, which provided tank trucks for the firefighting efforts. Around ten o'clock, a significant danger arose when the fire crossed Sauravegur, which is believed to have been caused by water that had been pumped onto the road freezing. The fire now threatened an area of approximately 30 km², which included four farms. The police were unaware of this threat until some time later, as Sauravegur was difficult to traverse.[citation needed] Vigorous firefighting efforts were carried out across the entire area throughout the morning and all afternoon. The Akranes fire brigade arrived with reinforcements around one o'clock, joining the Borgarnes and Borgarfjarðarsveit fire brigades and farmers with their slurry tankers. About sixty people worked hard to try to extinguish the fire rather than just contain it, aiming to stop the fire's progress at Ánastaðir and subsequently extinguish it. A helicopter from the Helicopter Service also joined the efforts and proved very effective.[16]"

Late in the evening of March 31, the fire began to subside, and firefighting efforts were then focused on Ánastaðir, where there was still a large blaze. Despite increased optimism, it was still believed that firefighting would continue for the next week or so. The fire department at Reykjavik Airport arrived in the evening with a pump truck intended to extinguish the fire completely. [citation needed] On April 1, weather conditions improved. A number of rescue team members were called out to relieve the firefighters, as the firefighting efforts were largely coming to an end. There was hope that the fire would be extinguished by the evening. Late in the evening of April 1, the fires were successfully extinguished. However, the area was still monitored to ensure that the fires did not reignite. At that time, it was estimated that up to 150 km² had burned, but it later became clear that this figure was exaggerated. [17][18] On April 2, the police organized watch teams to extinguish embers hidden in moss, as the intention was to definitively prevent the fires from flaring up again. They were now waiting for snow to begin falling, as it was believed that this would finally end the battle. This eventually happened on April 3. The area was monitored for an additional two days, but the guards had little to no action to take."

                "content": "In 1996 and 1997, the Icelandic Institute of Natural History mapped the vegetation in the area that burned, and according to that, most of the area consisted of wet fens and marshlands with ponds and lakes between rocky outcrops. The most common plant community was a cotton grass fen with dwarf birch and bilberry. This type of vegetation is primarily found in Mýrar and southern Snæfellsnes, but is rare elsewhere in the country, making it clear that the area has significant natural value. It appeared that the extensive and highly hummocky cotton grass fen was the most severely affected by the fire, and the dwarf birch is unlikely to recover for many years. The amount of dry grass in this area was as significant as it was due to limited grazing, but the dwarf birch was so scorched that what remained was mostly dead. Heather species also seemed to have been severely affected by the fire, but species that grow in very wet conditions, such as sedges and bog cotton, fared better. This is believed to be because the water level was high, and only the topmost stems burned. Small shrubs and birch also survived well. \"In short, the dry grass burns, and the substances that turn into gases rise into the air, such as nitrogen and carbon. However, the minerals remain, the surface becomes black, and therefore heats up more in the sunshine during spring,\" said Sigurður H. Magnússon, a plant ecologist. He also stated that the future development would likely involve more grasses, which can utilize nutrients very well, and fewer small shrubs and thickets. The marsh fires also affected wildlife. Bird nesting did not begin until a month after the fires, so the impact on birds was limited, but if the fires had occurred earlier, the effects would undoubtedly have been more severe. Birds found new nesting sites that spring, but these effects are not considered permanent. Field mice were also significantly affected, as was the aquatic life in the ponds and lakes in the area. Significant pollution resulted from the fires. Millions of cubic meters of carbon dioxide and other gases were released into the atmosphere, and the black smoke was visible across much of western Iceland as well as from space. A large amount of ash and other substances also entered the groundwater in the area, which is considered a very serious issue. Sigríður Anna Þórðardóttir, the then Minister for the Environment, tasked the Icelandic Institute of Natural History with investigating the effects of the fires on the area's nature. Subsequently, the Institute developed a research plan in collaboration with the University of Iceland, the Agricultural University of Iceland, and the Natural History Museum of Kópavogur. Research began in the summer of 2006 and concluded in 2010. The first results were presented in March 2007, a year after the fires."

Time will reveal what impact the grassfire will have on the ecosystem in the area, but it is important to begin research on this matter as soon as possible. However, it is a great relief that no one was harmed in the battle against the fires and that property damage was kept to a minimum. The nation has gained costly experience and will likely better understand the potential consequences of a grassfire breaking out under similar circumstances as those that arose here. Guðni Ágústsson, the Minister of Agriculture, visited the area in Hraunhreppur. \"Severe natural disasters have occurred here. The land is badly burned and damaged. What I admire most is that the farmers, firefighters, and those who fought the fire managed to save so much despite everything,\" he said in an interview with Morgunblaðið on April 4. The opinion of the responders was that although damage from the fire was largely prevented, grassfires like the Mýrar fires are very dangerous and that measures need to be taken to limit the risk when burning grass."

The fire arose when a farmer, in connection with land clearing, attempted to blast a stone by heating it with fire and cooling it with water. The summer of 1868 was very dry, and a fire ban was in place. The affected area was 15 km long and 10 km wide, destroying cottages and barns in several parishes, namely Furuby, Dädesjö, Gårdsby, and Hemmesjö, which further worsened the year of famine. According to the bailiff's report on August 18, the fire had spread in a northern and northwestern direction, threatening settlements in both Attsjö and Kårestad, and had spread further to Holkaryd, Björnamo, and Skårtaryd. The spread to the west was stopped at the road between Södra and Norra Åreda. The fire was fought by 4,000 men from 15 parishes. At the same time, fires were burning in several other places in Kalmar and Kronoberg counties, including a fire in Häljaryd that covered about 300 acres (approximately 1.5 km²), about 10 km northwest of Lysteryd on August 14, two days before the major fire. The area was estimated to be about 6,000 acres, approximately 30 km². In the County Administrative Board's report to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the length was stated to be 1 1/2 miles (15 km) and the width to be 1/8 to 3/4 miles (1.2-7.5 km)."

                "content": "The forest fires in Chubut were a natural disaster (although in some areas their origins seem to have been caused by human action) that occurred in the province of Chubut, in Argentina. The fire began on February 15, 2015, and the provincial government declared a state of environmental emergency on February 25, lasting until the beginning of April when the period of intense autumn rains greatly helped extinguish it. It mainly affected Cholila and other localities located in the northwest of Chubut. The fire started in the Cholila Lake valley, on its shores, near the coordinates 42°27′S 71°44′W / -42.450, -71.733. On April 6, 2015, it was reported that the burned forest area was over 41,000 hectares of virgin forests (almost the same size as Andorra), becoming the most significant fire on record in Argentina, with an area of over 41,000 hectares of native forests affected, surpassed seven years later by the fires in Corrientes in 2022. The fires were concentrated in the Comarca de los Alerces, in the Cholila Lake valley, on its southern and northern margins, in Cerro Cholila, and in the El Turco and Tucu Tucu canyons, with outbreaks in the Jara stream, the Turbio River, and Cerro Radal. It spread to the north and south, reaching the southern part of the Andean Region of Parallel 42, in Lago Puelo and Cerro Currumahuida, having reached the namesake national park to the north and entering Los Alerces National Park to the south. It is the largest forest fire in Argentina's history. In certain areas of the affected region, the outbreaks seem to have been caused by human action, so on Sunday, March 1, some people accused of starting fires were arrested. If the fires in this tourist region were intentionally caused, it was motivated by real estate speculation to later acquire the valuable affected lands at a low price."

                "content": "200 brigade members were deployed, later joined by 20 civilians, 6 airplanes, and 14 fire engines to combat the fires in the affected areas. The weather conditions were unfavorable due to the phenomenon known as thermal inversion. Internal work was carried out in the forest to prevent the fire from advancing, such as creating 40-meter-wide firebreaks. In addition to the 150 brigade members working on-site and dozens of volunteer neighbors, teams from the City of Neuquén and San Martín de los Andes (from the province of Neuquén), the Province of Buenos Aires, and the Province of Santa Cruz joined the efforts. From the Republic of Chile, three helicopters were sent to stop the fire column. Finally, after 17 days, thanks to the great efforts made by the brigade members and favorable environmental and meteorological conditions, such as a decrease in temperatures in the area, the fire's advance was controlled on the afternoon of March 4, even in the most critical areas. However, on March 23 of the same year, new intentionally set fires appeared in Los Alerces and Puelo National Parks. When the fires seemed extinguished, they reappeared at the end of March (also due to intentional causes), so by the 30th of that month, a large number of ancient and beautiful forests were still being destroyed. On Saturday, April 4, intense autumn rains began to extinguish the main fire hotspots, which led to the return of firefighting brigades from the province of Córdoba, as they were deemed no longer necessary. On the same day (after more than a month of devastating fires), Civil Defense announced that all the fires in Chubut were under control."

Governor Martín Buzzi denounced and accused the real estate sector of causing three of the five fire outbreaks in Cerro Currumahuida and Lago Puelo. He also mentioned: Argentine Defense Minister Agustín Rossi reported that the Armed Forces would increase support for the brigades working in the province of Chubut to combat the fires. On December 28, 2012, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner announced to the public the purchase of 26 firefighting planes for AR$ 57 million, modified to drop up to 2,000 liters of water over affected areas, and the rest of the firefighting planes are distributed among the different provinces due to the higher number of fires recorded during the summer months. Due to the magnitude of the event, the Chilean government provided helicopters from the first days of March. On March 14, 2015, the governor of Chubut announced the creation of the Cholila Interjurisdictional Park. It will cover an area of 220,000 hectares, with intangible zones and areas subject to a management plan. It will border Lago Puelo National Park to the north and Los Alerces National Park to the south."

O'Reilly owns the private neighborhood San Esteban in Cholila, covering about 1,000 hectares and 160 plots. The businessman faced several criticisms and complaints regarding constructions on some of these lands, built on public lands in General Pacheco that belonged to Radio Nacional and were irregularly transferred by the former Entel to Telecom, Telefónica, and Startel in 1990, when the company was privatized."

The fire burned a total of 2,335 hectares in the municipalities of Andratx, Estellencs, and Calvià. This fire burned 2% of the Serra de Tramuntana and was considered the most significant in the history of the Balearic Islands. The fire originated when a 44-year-old resident of Andratx, I.G., held a barbecue with friends near Son Curt. The resident was arrested on Monday, July 29, and admitted to the events. Approximately two-thirds of the burned area consisted of shrubs and carritx, so recovery by 2017 had already progressed relatively quickly. In the pine forest area, however, very few specimens were saved, and the new pines, sprouting from the seeds released by the burned pines, grow at a slower rate. The low humidity and rainfall in the area do not aid recovery, which is why the Ministry of the Environment developed a restoration plan for the affected area. One of the necessary measures was reforestation in areas affected by the 1994 fire, where natural reforestation is not possible because the pine specimens were not yet large enough to produce seeds. Measures were also taken to control the impact of the feral goat, which is very abundant in the area and endangers the growth of young specimens. Research into the reforestation of the area has concluded that terraces are of great help in these processes, as they prevent soil erosion. A small six-hectare fire in July 2021 burned in Coll de la Gramola, an area affected in 2013, which concerns experts about the possibility that the pines born from the burned cones may not survive. The perpetrator of the fire was sentenced in 2020 to two and a half years in prison for a crime of forest fire due to gross negligence, with a mitigating factor for a schizophrenic-type mental disorder."

The summer of 1994 was one of the worst in terms of the area affected by fires on the Iberian Peninsula. Catalonia, in particular, was one of the most affected areas, with a total of 76,626 hectares burned that year, and especially severe were the fires in the regions of Bages, Berguedà, and Lluçanès, where more than 45,000 hectares burned. In the history of fires in Catalonia, the flames had never had such an impact nor had such high fire energy been manifested. Those uninterrupted days of fire in July led, from then on, to a change in the perception of fires. During the summer of 1994, 60 fires were reported, 12 of which are considered major fires."

The second wave, between July 17 and 18, took place in Priorat, Segarra, and Alt Camp. During those July days, the weather conditions—temperatures of 40 degrees, gusts of 50 km/h of very hot and dry southwesterly wind, and low humidity below 10%—facilitated the rapid spread of fire through the extremely dry forests of Navàs, Castellnou de Bages, Súria, Fonollosa, Balsareny, Callús, and Sant Joan de Vilatorrada, within the Bages region, and on July 6 it spread to Puig-reig and Viver i Serrateix in the Berguedà region. At the same time, a fire caused by sparks from a power line in Gargallà (Montmajor municipality) spread with extreme speed and intensity through neighboring municipalities in lower Berguedà and Lluçanès: Casserres, Montclar, Gironella, Sagàs, Santa Maria de Merlès, La Quar, etc. Another factor that contributed to the fire's advance and hindered its extinction was the abandonment of forest exploitation, which caused the forests to be overloaded with fuel and lacked barriers such as meadows or fields.\n\nMore than 3,000 firefighters, 1,400 agents from other security forces, and 20,000 volunteers were mobilized to try to extinguish the flames. In addition to the forests, the damages included 35 burned farmhouses, 40 injured people, and five deaths."

However, the Court considered that the fire had started due to sparks from this line, which was not adequately protected against short circuits, and left the door open to claim compensation through civil proceedings. Subsequently, a Barcelona court sentenced Endesa in 2012 to pay 37.5 million euros to a total of 117 forest and agricultural property owners affected by the fire, but at the same time ruled that compensation was not owed to the owners of about 10,000 hectares, considering it to be a different fire. These were a group of property owners from the municipalities of Olvan, Sagàs, Gironella, and La Quar, totaling about 10,000 burned hectares. The judge determined that these properties were affected by a fire different from the one in Gargallà, which in this case would have originated in Casserres. These owners, who had to pay legal costs, filed an appeal."

On Tuesday, July 7, the fire was brought under control, but due to strong winds and high temperatures recorded during those days of the heatwave, the fire reignited. The front advanced southward, reaching the outskirts of the urban areas of Pozo Alcón, Huesa, and Larva, and in a few hours, the affected area increased from 200 to 1,800 hectares and surpassed 2,000 hectares shortly after. It developed on two fronts: the southwest front headed toward Alicún de Ortega in the province of Granada, while the southeast front moved toward Guadiana Menor and Hinojares, where a firebreak was constructed. On July 9, \"Level 1\" of the Forest Fire Emergency Plan was activated. The fire remained outside the boundaries of the Cazorla, Segura, and Las Villas Natural Park, about 15 kilometers away, although part of the burned area is of great ecological value, with centuries-old pines, as well as mastic trees, junipers, low forest, and other species typical of the dry Mediterranean climate. Likewise, a large area of reforested Aleppo pine, highly flammable, was destroyed, which had been attempting, with little success, to prevent the advance of desertification spreading from the Levante Almeriense to the north of the province of Granada. As a precaution, 29 people were evacuated from the hamlet of Ceal, Chíllar farmhouse, and Cortijo Nuevo, all belonging to Huesa, as the strong wind carried embers over a thousand meters away, rendering firebreaks and other preventive measures ineffective. The fire also affected several agricultural and livestock areas, burning olive groves and pastures. On Sunday, July 12, the fire was stabilized, moving from Level 1 to Level 0, which allowed the withdrawal of the UME. The remaining resources on-site took appropriate measures to prevent its resurgence, as another heatwave with extreme maximum temperatures occurred in the following days. Evacuated residents were also authorized to return to their homes. Initial estimates, after the fire level decreased, calculated a burned area exceeding 8,000 hectares, although later this figure rose to 10,000 hectares, still not under control. However, other estimates raised the burned area to 14,000 hectares. INFOCA declared the fire under control on the morning of July 15, and it was officially extinguished in the early afternoon of July 29, after twenty-five days."

The fires are largely started by people who illegally try to obtain more farmland. One of the reasons for doing this is to expand palm oil plantations. Indonesia aims to become the largest palm oil producer in the world. Some of the fires may start spontaneously due to the smoldering heat in compost. During the dry season, the fires have the opportunity to rage for a very long time due to the lack of rain. Outside Indonesia, there are also other places in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia where many forest fires occur. Due to the forest fires, a huge amount of smoke is produced, which often causes nuisance thousands of kilometers away in surrounding countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore. Within Indonesia itself, schools are regularly closed due to the smoke, flight schedules at airports are disrupted by delayed flights, and warnings are issued for traffic because visibility is greatly reduced by the smoke. The local population often wears dust masks to protect themselves from the smoke. The number of health complaints also increases due to the smoke. In addition to humans, the smoke and fire also pose a threat to the animals living on Sumatra and Borneo, such as the Sumatran tiger. Beyond the direct danger of the fire, their habitat is also shrinking over the years as a large part of the rainforests is converted into farmland. Deforestation in Indonesia is so severe that, with 1.8 million hectares of deforestation per year, it will even be recorded in the Guinness Book of Records. However, this deforestation is not only caused by forest fires but also by commercial logging. The areas where the fires occur are clearly visible on satellite images."

For this, 150 million US dollars is being made available. Some measures that have been taken or proposed: In October 2006, the President of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, indicated that his country would sign the treaty among ASEAN countries on transboundary air pollution caused by smoke."

It was suggested that farmers with small agricultural areas did not sufficiently realize the risks associated with forest fires. For this reason, it was proposed that better education on the matter was necessary. Over the years, only a few people have received prison sentences in connection with causing forest fires."

In 2005 and 2006, a team of scientists conducted pedestrian surveys that provided a better understanding of the lives of the inhabitants of the destroyed area from the Paleolithic to the 20th century. These discoveries were documented in a large-format collective work of 504 pages published in 2009, titled \"Archaeology of a Burned Mountain.\" The multidisciplinary study led to the discovery of 74 previously unknown archaeological sites and clarified knowledge of several others: the ruined villages of Ropidera and Casesnoves, as well as two protohistoric oppida. It also showed that the history of settlement in this area, since the Paleolithic, experienced alternating periods of prosperity and decline, or even abandonment. However, it should be noted that the research did not involve excavations, leaving many questions unanswered. It demonstrated human presence on the site since the final Acheulean and Middle Paleolithic, as well as an absence of Neolithic traces, which may suggest the plateau was abandoned during that time. The main contribution of this research lies in the Bronze Age, beginning in the Chalcolithic, with around fifty sites discovered, allowing the reconstruction of the lifestyle of the inhabitants of the time: herders and artisans whose dwellings were centered around an oppidum located on a height, secondary habitats on the slopes, and pastures for livestock in the valleys. Their craftsmanship, in chloritoschist, is unique and not found at any other archaeological site in the region. From the end of the Bronze Age to the Carolingian period, the plateau does not appear to have been inhabited. The fire allowed for the mapping of the village of Ropidera, in good condition, as it was at the time of its abandonment around the 15th century: large stone houses composed of several rooms with enclosures for livestock attached to the dwellings. The size and complexity of the layouts of these houses are surprising, as well as their grouping: in other nearby mountainous areas like Vallespir, medieval settlements are dispersed (Catalan mas). Not far from Ropidera, a kiln of undetermined age was also discovered, likely used for firing clay tiles. The fire also revealed an old pink marble quarry at the southern edge of the burned area, in the commune of Bouleternère. Many medieval buildings in the department use pink marble, which is usually attributed to the quarries of Villefranche-de-Conflent. The discovery of the Bouleternère quarries could challenge this systematic attribution. Nearby, the fire also uncovered a lime kiln likely dating back at least to the late Middle Ages."

Its origin was a barbecue that some hikers neglected at a picnic area near the Casares cave in the municipality of Riba de Saelices. A total of 10,352.57 hectares of wooded land burned, mostly consisting of resin pine, juniper, and oak forests, 2,380.16 hectares of scrubland and pasture, and 154.64 hectares of non-forest surface. The fire devastated 2,400 hectares of high ecological value belonging to the Alto Tajo natural park. Around half a thousand people were evacuated, including entire populations such as Ciruelos del Pinar and Tobillos, among others. The management of the fire by the government of Castilla-La Mancha was harshly criticized from various sectors, alleging that the necessary aerial and ground resources were not sent during the first hours. These criticisms were based, among other things, on the 112 recordings and the fact that the alert level was only raised, and help was requested from the central government when the tragic news of the eleven deaths was known, as acknowledged by the then vice president of the Junta, Máximo Díaz Cano. On December 17, 2005, nearly 5,000 people according to the police, and 10,000 according to the organizers, demonstrated in Guadalajara to honor the deceased and demand accountability."

While the majority of the group visited the cave guided by the caretaker Emilio Moreno, the other three members prepared a fire on two built-in grills located in the recreational area and fueled it with dry grass, branches, and pinecones collected from the surroundings. At the end of the visit, the caretaker noticed the fires and warned them that the use of the barbecues was authorized but that he strongly advised against it due to the strong wind blowing in the area, the high temperatures—over 33°C—and the abundance of dry stubble: \"I told Marcelino that he could cause trouble with the weather that day. Not even the dumbest person in my village would think of making a barbecue on a day like that, with an infernal wind and next to stubble. That’s just not having any sense.\" Around 2:40 PM, a spark or ember fell from the southernmost barbecue, which was unattended, igniting the dry grass, and the fire quickly spread northeast through the riparian forest and cereal fields until it reached a forested area of resin pine. The fire, fanned by the strong wind, became uncontrollable and by mid-afternoon forced the evacuation of five hundred residents from the towns of Ciruelos del Pinar, Tobillos, and Mazarete. Ground crews fought the fire throughout the night, and by dawn on Sunday, July 17, it had two active fronts heading toward Cobeta and Luzón, respectively. Throughout the day, more resources joined the fight against the fire, which already included three land-based water-loading planes, two seaplanes—two more joined late in the afternoon—two helicopters, fifteen heavy machinery teams, two BRIF units, as well as several ground crews and teams from the Guadalajara Provincial Firefighting Consortium. Throughout Sunday, July 17, the residents of Mazarete were able to return to their town, but the fire remained active on three fronts: Mazarete-Anquela-Selas, Ciruelos del Pinar-Luzón-Santa María del Espino, and another, irregular one, reaching Villarejo de Medina. The most concerning front was the one threatening Luzón and Santa María del Espino, and at 6:00 PM, the evacuation of both towns was ordered. The GU-951 road, between Ciruelos del Pinar and Mazarete; the GU-944, between Mazarete and Cobeta; and the GU-949, between Mazarete and Ablanque, were closed. The CM-2107 road was only open for firefighting services. Late in the afternoon, rumors began circulating about the deaths of several members of the Cogolludo crew trapped by the fire. At 9:30 PM, the Guadalajara Government Subdelegation confirmed these rumors, and a few hours later, the bodies of eleven forest agents—ten men and one woman—were found on the slope of a ravine. Only one member of the crew survived, having found refuge under the stream of water falling from the damaged truck in which they had tried to escape the flames. On Monday, July 18, the bodies of the firefighters were recovered, and the fronts threatening the towns of Santa María del Espino, Luzón, Tobillos, Mazarete, Anquela del Ducado, and Villarejo de Medina were brought under control. On July 20, all active fronts of the fire were successfully controlled."

Initially, the nine hikers and the forest ranger of the area were charged, but in 2007 the charges were extended to twenty more people, including several high-ranking officials of the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha, who demonstrated before the judge that their work was impeccable. The trial took place in the Provincial Court of Guadalajara between 2009 and 2012 and concluded with a verdict in which only one of the hikers was convicted of a forest fire offense caused by gross negligence, receiving a sentence of two years in prison, a fine of €3,650, and compensation of €10,640,971.14 to the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha for damages caused by the fire. This sentence was appealed by the convicted individual and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2013."

It occurred on Wednesday, July 22, in the Sierra de Majalinos, within the municipal area of the Aragonese town of Aliaga (Teruel), quickly spreading to the neighboring municipality of Ejulve. Later, it also spread to the areas of La Zoma, Cañizar del Olivar, and Villarluengo. It was considered extinguished on July 27, five days later, after long and arduous efforts by firefighting teams. The fire started at a very critical time when other fires were occurring in the province of Teruel, which, overall, represented the worst natural disaster recorded in Aragon since the Maestrazgo fires of 1994, in which 30,000 hectares burned."

All these natural circumstances, added to human causes (the significant delay in the arrival of the first firefighting resources), explain the speed with which the fire devastated 7,000 hectares during the first 48 hours, and therefore the difficulty in extinguishing it during the first days of the fire's activity."

The fire not only caused the affected area to lose a large part of its natural heritage but also severely impacted the livelihood of part of its population, who depend on the exploitation and conservation of the natural environment and the tourism sector. During its progression, there were particularly critical moments, as the flames reached the vicinity of a fish farm in the Aliaga area that contained eight gas tanks at risk of exploding. And especially because they reached the town of La Cañadilla (Aliaga), where two buildings were burned down. Due to the complexity of extinguishing it and the dangers to health and safety caused by the fire and dense smoke, the residents of La Cañadilla, Cirujeda, La Zoma, Cañizar del Olivar, Ejulve, and Montoro de Mezquita were evacuated from their homes, the A-2403 road between Aliaga and Ejulve was closed, as well as the A-1702 road between Villarluengo and Ejulve. The flames in this last locality came as close as half a kilometer to its urban center. Another direct consequence was the suspension of the fourth edition of the Carrasca Rock music festival, which was scheduled to take place in Ejulve on July 24 and 25, three days after the fire began."

The fire lasted about eight days and had a criminal origin. The fire spread beyond the park area and is currently also affecting farms, villages, and private environmental reserves in the surrounding area."

Likewise, the CCOO union stated in a report on forest fires that the development of this fire was due to the forest's uncleanliness and the significant lack of preventive measures, with excess undergrowth and dry pines in the forest, as well as the absence of clean paths and trails that would have facilitated the extinction tasks for vehicles and forest workers. The Department, for its part, argued that in 1995 and 1996, significant forestry work was carried out on about 90 hectares of this forest, consisting of thinning, enhancement pruning, and waste removal. The forest is publicly owned, belonging to the Pegalajar town council. A total of 119 people, a forest fire vehicle, three helicopters, a ground-loading plane, and the Mobile Meteorology and Transmissions Unit participated in extinguishing the fire. On Wednesday, July 12, following its favorable evolution, it was declared under control at noon. On Thursday, July 13, 2006, at 10:00 a.m., the fire was considered extinguished."

Therefore, Muli County is known as \"One Muli, Half Forest.\"\n\nThe Muli forest area belongs to the northern hemisphere's subtropical monsoon climate zone, with distinct wet and dry seasons and an average annual precipitation of 818 millimeters. From November to June of the following year, precipitation accounts for less than 10% of the annual total, the air is dry, and there are many windy days.

On the afternoon of the 31st, due to a sudden change in wind direction, the wildfire experienced a flashover, resulting in 30 firefighters going missing, including 27 forest fire brigade members and 3 local firefighting personnel. According to a surviving commander from the Xichang Fire Brigade, the firefighters had already suppressed the fire, leaving only two small ignition points. However, smoke was still rising from the ground, accompanied by crackling sounds. They began to retreat in two groups, but less than a minute later, the forest suddenly experienced a flashover, with flames shooting up tens of meters high. The firefighters who couldn't escape in time were engulfed by the flames and tragically lost their lives.\n\nOn April 1, the bodies of all 30 missing firefighters were recovered. As of 5:00 PM on April 1, the burned area had reached approximately 15 hectares, and the fire remained difficult to control. At 6:30 AM on April 2, 250 reinforcements from the Sichuan Armed Police Corps, including 100 from the Panzhihua Detachment and 150 from the Chengdu Detachment, were dispatched to the fire site. After on-site inspections, the open flames at the fire site were extinguished, with only a few smoke points remaining on cliffs, and the threat of fire spread was eliminated.\n\nIn the early hours of April 2, a convoy carrying the bodies of the missing personnel arrived in Xichang City. That evening, the second batch of six fallen heroes' remains was transported to Xichang. At 10:00 AM on April 2, the Muli County People's Government in Liangshan Prefecture received the first compensation payment of 1.8 million yuan from the \"Huinongbao\" natural disaster public liability insurance provided by China People's Insurance Company, compensating the families of the 30 firefighters who perished in the \"3.30\" forest fire.\n\nSome surviving firefighters from the Xichang Fire Brigade exhibited acute stress reactions, including frequent sighing, recurring flashbacks of the incident, and difficulty sleeping. Starting April 6, experts from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences began providing psychological support. Currently, the firefighters are in the \"stress response period,\" and the experts are focusing on addressing various emotional stress issues."

Due to strong winds, the area on the northeast cliff of Lier Village, Yalongjiang Town, which had been covered by artificial precipitation, reignited. Burning rotten stumps rolled down the cliff, igniting unburned trees, and flying embers were blown to the forested area east of the fire site, causing further burning. The Sichuan Provincial Forest Fire Brigade dispatched a team of seven to the scene to assess the situation. By 5 a.m., more than 350 local firefighters had arrived at the fire site. Additionally, 440 fire suppression team members from surrounding towns also rushed to the site to clear the burned land. Currently, the governor of Liangshan Prefecture, Su Ga'erbu, has led a working group to the fire site, and the Sichuan Provincial Forest Fire Brigade has dispatched an additional 95 forest firefighters, along with three helicopters for aerial reconnaissance and bucket firefighting operations. By April 10, the fire had been largely extinguished."

It was determined that Yang Dawa, Zou Ping, and Ba Jin met the relevant conditions and requirements for martyr recognition, and it was decided to submit the application to the Sichuan Provincial People's Government for approval in the name of the prefectural government. The other 27 fallen officers and soldiers of the Liangshan Forest Fire Brigade had already been reported through relevant channels for martyr recognition. The 27 forest firefighters who died in the line of duty were posthumously awarded first-class merit, and 11 were posthumously recognized as members of the Communist Party of China. Wang Huirong, deputy director of the third reforestation and management office of the Muli Forestry Bureau in Sichuan Province, went missing during the firefighting efforts and was found dead at 3:15 p.m. on April 4.

Most of the firefighters who perished were born in the 1990s, and many mainland netizens expressed their condolences on social media platforms. On April 1, a netizen named Yin Mouyun (male, 30 years old, from Bijie City, Guizhou Province) with the Baidu account \"Tornado Waiting for You\" was accused of posting remarks insulting the firefighters on the Baidu platform, causing a negative impact. Yin Mouyun, suspected of the crime of provoking trouble, was arrested and criminally detained in Quanzhou, Fujian. The official WeChat public account of the Ministry of Emergency Management angrily denounced him as \"scum,\" and Yin Mouyun released a video apologizing. Subsequently, as of April 4, reports from various regions indicated that 12 more netizens were arrested for \"insulting the fallen firefighting heroes.\" On April 2, a man named Dai Mou was detained for posting insulting remarks about firefighters in the comments section of the Douyin app. On April 5, the police in Panyu District, Guangzhou, reported that a netizen named Zhao Mou had continuously posted defamatory and insulting remarks about the firefighters in a WeChat group and on Sina Weibo, causing a negative impact. Zhao Mou was criminally detained by the police on suspicion of provoking trouble. On April 6, a netizen named Li Moumou, originally from Hebei and residing in Tianjin's Binhai New Area, posted insulting remarks about the fallen firefighting heroes under a blog post mourning the \"30 firefighters who perished in the Sichuan Liangshan forest fire.\" He was arrested by the Binhai New Area Public Security Bureau at around 9 p.m. that day and was criminally detained on April 7 on suspicion of provoking trouble. On April 8, a local \"Weibo influencer\" in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, named Ma Chengliang (35 years old), used the account \"Ma's Zhenyuan Planning\" in his \"Ma's Metaphysics Anti-Fraud\" WeChat group to publicly post insulting remarks about the Liangshan fire firefighters. During interrogation, it was revealed that his Weibo followers numbered 510,000. Ma Chengliang was later criminally detained for the crime of provoking trouble. On April 9, a man named Yang Mou in Kunming was arrested for posting insulting remarks about the fallen Liangshan firefighters in his WeChat Moments. Preliminary investigations revealed that Yang Mou had been beaten by Zheng Mou and, in retaliation, used Zheng Mou's ID photo and posted in Zheng Mou's tone a WeChat Moment saying \"Come and catch me if you dare.\" Yang Mou was later criminally detained on suspicion of \"provoking trouble,\" while Zheng Mou was administratively punished for assaulting others. After confirming the deaths of rescue personnel, multiple sports events in China, including the fourth round of the Chinese Super League and the CBA quarterfinals, arranged moments of silence before the games to mourn the fallen rescue personnel. On April 3, football player Cristiano Ronaldo posted on Weibo to mourn the \"brave firefighters\" in the fire. In response to some public doubts about the necessity of firefighting and the high number of casualties, Bai Ye, the director of the teaching and research office at the China Fire and Rescue Academy, stated on April 3 that the forest fire in Muli County had to be extinguished. Otherwise, if left to burn naturally, the fire could further expand, endangering nearby villages and towns and causing greater property and personnel losses. Additionally, the main reason for the high number of firefighter casualties was the \"sudden flashover of the mountain fire,\" not a lack of professionalism in the team."

It was the most virulent fire in Catalonia after the Alt Empordà fires of 2012. The fire started in the municipality of Torre de l'Espanyol and quickly spread to different neighboring municipalities: Vinebre, la Palma d'Ebre, Flix (Ribera d'Ebre), Maials and Llardecans (Segrià), and Bovera and la Granadella (Garrigues). Participating in the extinction tasks were 350 firefighters from the Generalitat and 260 personnel from the Military Emergency Unit (UME).

Caseres, Bot, Benifallet, Riba-roja d'Ebre, or Mas de Barberans have been continuously losing population for decades. The main losses have occurred in agriculturally based municipalities like Flix, according to a report by the URV. To address this issue, various initiatives have been launched with varying degrees of success, such as rural coworking, promoting the arrival of new families, strengthening social services to retain the existing population, rehabilitating spaces, and improving public transport. Depopulation exacerbates the severity of fires, among other reasons, because it is linked to the abandonment of fields, which could act as firebreaks. In the area where the fire occurred, there were several abandoned fields. In Catalonia, there are 45,000 hectares of abandoned fields. The fire occurred during a heatwave and after months of very low rainfall. The high recorded temperatures, wind, and low humidity caused the fire to spread rapidly and become highly dangerous, with an initial potential surface area of up to 20,000 hectares."

The regulations governing this require the process to take place in a space designated for this purpose, an impermeable manure pit.

Several neighbors volunteered to distribute drinks and food to the emergency teams working in the area. In the first 24 hours, they made 500 sandwiches. The Vinebre Town Hall, where the control and command center against the fire was set up, received many calls from people willing to help. Dozens of people expressed through social networks their willingness to donate sheep, food, and money to Pere Jornet, who had lost his entire flock in the fire and had expressed his distress in images that went viral. In the images, he appeared devastated and said he had no will to move forward. Both this initiative and others like it were embraced under the #Rebrotarem initiative to bring together solidarity efforts to face the consequences of the fire with an eye to the future."

The fire covered an area of 944 hectares. The district declared a state of disaster. At times, more than 3,000 emergency personnel from fire departments, disaster relief, the Technical Relief Agency, the Bundeswehr, the Federal Police, and state police from several federal states were deployed.

The property is owned by the federal government and was permanently closed as a military training ground in 2015. In March 2019, Environment Minister Till Backhaus presented a hazard prevention concept – particularly against forest fires – in coordination with the federal government. The explosives in the ground significantly hindered efforts to extinguish the fire. Due to the explosives, people must maintain a safety distance of one kilometer from the fire.

Shortly thereafter, fires broke out almost simultaneously in three locations. On the night of June 30 to July 1, the three nearby villages of Alt Jabel, Jessenitz-Werk, and Trebs, with a total of 650 residents, as well as a student holiday camp, were evacuated as a precaution, followed later by the village of Volzrade. To protect the villages from the spreading fire, the fire department set up a so-called firebreak. In Alt Jabel, the swimming pool of an outdoor swimming facility was drained to obtain extinguishing water. By July 1, 2019, 430 hectares of forest were already in flames during the day. In the evening, despite massive firefighting efforts, the burning area was reported to have spread to 470 hectares. The fire spread very quickly due to strong and frequently shifting winds. The fire mainly consisted of ground fires. On this day, District Administrator Stefan Sternberg (SPD) declared a state of emergency. In the afternoon, the Interministerial Command Staff (ImFüSt) was convened in the Schwerin state government. The smoke generated by the fire was widely noticeable. Due to the smoke development, the Brandenburg Regional Control Center Northwest issued an official hazard warning for Potsdam, Brandenburg an der Havel, and the districts of Barnim, Havelland, Oberhavel, Ostprignitz-Ruppin, Potsdam-Mittelmark, and Prignitz, advising people to keep windows and doors closed. The acrid smell of the fire was also noticeable on July 1 as far as Berlin, Leipzig, Chemnitz, and Dresden. Numerous calls regarding the smoke were received by control centers in all these cities."

The Bundeswehr provided clearing and recovery tanks to create firebreaks and enable firefighters to safely access areas contaminated with munitions. The number of firefighting helicopters deployed by the Federal Police and the Bundeswehr increased to eight on that day; water cannons from police forces across all northern German states were brought in.

The forest fire danger index of the German Weather Service rose to the highest level 5, among other places in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Shortly after the fire broke out, three fire sites were identified, and arson was initially considered the most likely cause. After the investigation was concluded, arson could almost be ruled out. Instead, a smaller fire from June 25, 2019, which could not be fully extinguished due to the soil's ammunition contamination, had spread again due to the ongoing dryness. Due to the existing contamination with munitions, the spread of the fire could not be contained at an earlier stage, as otherwise the emergency forces would have been exposed to excessive danger by violating safety distances."

The Interior Minister launched the €50 million program \"Future-Ready Fire Departments.\" The federal government provided funds for the accelerated clearance of ordnance on its properties. The state's ordnance disposal service assumes that clearing areas around villages considered contaminated with ordnance will take several years, more than half a century.

However, research as early as 2013 has shown that the fires are increasing in size and frequency. These fires are not necessarily harmful to nature in themselves. After a fire, new grasses and shrubs sprout, attracting animals (grass and willow shoots for moose, berry bushes for bears, etc.), the ash enriches the soil, dense shrubbery is cleared, and the soil is warmed (which benefits drainage). Sometimes fires are even deliberately set as part of nature management. However, large and prolonged fires also have disadvantages for nature and the environment. For example, there is the emission of: The fires also disrupt ecosystems in the north. Due to air pollution and drought, the plant world changes: plants appear and disappear in unexpected places. This has, for instance, led to a halving of the reindeer population in some areas because the animals could no longer find their food source, lichen. In addition to the more visible forest fires, ground fires often occur in the Arctic. This type of fire is even more harmful than classic forest fires because the fire persists for a long time and cannot be extinguished with firefighting water or even a rain shower."

A large part of the tundra in Alaska was already dangerously close to this point between 1971 and 2000, and the expansion of this vulnerable area could cause the number of fires to rise quite suddenly. The causes of the rapidly increasing number of fires lie in the drying of the soil and the melting of the permafrost.

In the Kavala area, specifically to the east, many sources report that the fire started either in Chalkero at the landfill from the rekindling of six hotspots. The front moved towards Agios Tryfonas and Perigiali, while a smaller one headed towards Aspri Ammos, leading to the evacuation of an ammunition warehouse containing 5,800 kilograms of explosives, and continued towards the Irini campsite, while one hotspot moved towards Ano Lefki, burning seven houses. Fewer sources mention that it started either in Lefki or from the northwest, between the areas of Chalkero and Old Kavala, where the forested areas were very large. Unexpectedly, by the early hours of August 15, the fire reached the Dexamenis area and Agios Silas, with the still-operational Sanatorium being evacuated. At 10:20 PM, the PPC substation in the Perigiali area suffered severe damage, leaving the entire city without power and immediately being declared in a state of emergency. During the day, hotspots simultaneously broke out in Agios Andreas, Limnia, and Elaphochori. Olive trees, pines, and shrubs were burned, totaling 10,000 stremmas of artificial forest, which had been created during the 1910s and completed in 1980. Four firefighting aircraft and 150 volunteers from Eleftheroupoli were immediately mobilized. The press of the time reported that on August 15, residents had abandoned the city, while the sirens at the Town Hall sounded for the first time since World War II. Furthermore, the fire on Thasos also led 20,000 tourists and 7,000 permanent residents to be transported by ferry to Kavala, while 200 tourists attempted to swim to Kavala, unaware that the distance was 17 miles. They were eventually rescued by boats. On August 14, a fire broke out in the southern part of Thasos, in Koinyra. Due to the strong winds blowing, the fire quickly moved towards Skala Potamias, Skala Panagias, Potos, Pefkari, Limenaria, and Maries. A total of 118,000 stremmas of forested land and shrubs were burned, with five fatalities and two missing persons. Additionally, 2,000 beehives, 1,800 sheep and goats, and over 100 houses were destroyed."

On the afternoon of July 21, the fire reignited with a strengthening of the Garbí wind reaching 80 km/h and very low humidity, below 20%. The fire crossed the Canaletes River and the T-330 road (from Arnes to Prat de Comte) and reached 1 km from the town of Horta de Sant Joan. On July 22, the fire reignited again in the Canaletes River valley and advanced towards Prat de Comte (Terra Alta), moving away from Horta de Sant Joan. Firefighters managed to stop the fire's advance 3 km from Prat de Comte, but it continued burning in areas inaccessible by land. On July 23, the wind calmed, the fire's perimeter was stabilized, and firefighters were able to focus on soaking the burned areas to prevent any reignition. The next morning, firefighters were able to announce that the fire was under control. It was not until August 3 that the Ports fire was officially declared extinguished."

For fire prevention in the forests of Neringa, a forestry project was prepared, which included cutting firebreaks (gaps for vehicle access) and fire barriers to facilitate easier fire containment, as well as establishing water intake points from the Curonian Lagoon. However, the project was only partially implemented, and when fires recurred in 2014, firefighters had to transport water from Juodkrantė, located 7 km away from the fire site."

The fires were located in the tropical regions of the Chiquitano forest—considered a public good of our planet—the Bolivian Amazon, and the western Pantanal, affecting populations such as Roboré, Puerto Busch, and San Ignacio de Velasco among the eight regions directly involved in the department of Santa Cruz and also in the department of Beni in Bolivia. It also endangered municipal reserves such as Tucabaca, Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, or Ñembi Guasu, territory of uncontacted Ayoreo peoples. This event resulted in the loss of five million hectares of Chiquitania dry forest, whose land use is forestal and which in recent years has been converted into agricultural production land without prior consultation with the communities inhabiting the region. Fires caused by direct human action are a significant reason for forest loss in the Amazon basin. This situation has sparked controversy over the government's role in control and prevention measures, which experts have described as one of the most complex disasters in Latin America. Similarly, actions taken to control the disaster, such as the initial refusal to request international aid during the crisis, have been criticized."

One of the most widespread practices for vegetation removal is the so-called \"chaqueo,\" a practice consisting of burning vegetation cover similar to slash-and-burn. A 2010 report by the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) Foundation placed Bolivia among the countries with the highest deforestation rates, almost tripling Brazil's rate. At that rate of forest loss, the disappearance of forests in Bolivia was predicted by 2100. On April 26, 2019, Foreign Minister Diego Pary and the Minister of China's Customs Administration, Ni Yuefeng, signed a protocol to export 20,000 tons of meat to China, which means $75 million in revenue for the country. For this, it is necessary to expand from 13 million hectares of livestock use to 20 million, as stated in the 2020-2030 Livestock Development Plan, which was presented by ranchers to the President of Bolivia. Miguel Ángel Crespo, an expert in agroecology, predicts that this type of agro-extractivism exacerbates droughts, floods, climate changes, pest outbreaks, and soil erosion. According to Natalia Calderón, director of the Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza (FAN), 60% of deforestation is due to livestock farming, and significant deforestation expansion has been detected in Charagua and the Chiquitania in Santa Cruz, as reported on July 5. Juan Carlos Ojopi, a member of the Amazon Defense Committee of the Madera River Basin in the department of Beni, expressed his outright rejection, as it endorses the deforestation of lands they were reforesting themselves, fearing that all their work will be cleared and burned. A report by the Amazon Network of Georeferenced Socio-Environmental Information (RAISG) states that Bolivia lost 18.7 million hectares of forests due to clearings and fires between 2005 and 2018."

The experts affirm that the disaster is extreme and suggest the use of heavy machinery to implement firebreaks at a distance. According to Enrique Bruno: \"They have a proposal, the only reliable proposal means all the work with machinery creating firebreak lines at a distance, many machines will be needed, we need more bulldozers in all the fire areas. This is a priority, and the Government must take it as such because this is already overwhelming.\" As of September 17, there are three fire fronts according to monitoring technician and biologist Suri Cabrera Barea: Fire hotspots are being sought by land and satellite, when the winds are from the south the fire decreases and becomes imperceptible, but when it shifts to the north it becomes uncontrollable, many hotspots multiply, and those that had been fought reignite. The expert points out: \"The personnel is insufficient for the number of hotspots that multiply, especially on days with higher temperatures and wind. Volunteer firefighters with the greatest possible autonomy are needed, volunteers with drones to help identify heat points, more bulldozers (the fire needs to be stopped with heavy machinery), more water tanks, chainsaw operators with their tools, uniforms for volunteer firefighters, tools, backpacks.\" Community members, firefighters, and volunteers report a lack of machinery and equipment, which makes the fight against the fire much longer. Additionally, they suffer burns while trying to extinguish the fire."

He explained that they stopped counting because there were too many. The biologist, with more than 15 years of experience in natural disasters, had never seen such a level of disaster. A flagship case of this shelter is that of the anteater Valentina, who arrived with all four paws burned and fell into a coma upon entering the shelter, according to veterinarian Flora Cecilia Dorado.

As the fire progressed and new ecosystems were destroyed, the figures have increased. By the end of September, the fire persisted, so the analyses and quantifications carried out are partial and subject to later reevaluations that may yield higher numbers. Around 500 animal species are at risk in the Chiquitanía alone. In general, more than 1,200 species, including insects like bees, 43 amphibians, 140 reptiles, 788 birds, and 242 mammals, are suffering the consequences of this disaster. During firefighting operations, firefighters have found various evidence of animals that fell victim to the fires, such as reptiles and charred mammals, as well as others fleeing to areas unaffected by the fires, like puma cubs. One of the animals most at risk is the Ameerega boehmei frog, an endemic species that can only be found in the Chiquitano Dry Forest (BSC). There is fear that the fire may reach the territory of the blue macaw. In an evaluation conducted by Ciencia Bolivia and the College of Biologists of La Paz, it was determined that around 1,600 species were lost in the fire. According to Iván Arnold, executive director of the Nature, Land, and Life Foundation (Nativa), the few animals that remain in the fire-affected area are destined to die because they lack food sources and water. Burned peccaries can be observed, which, despite being fast, could not escape, demonstrating how voracious the fire can be. For him, the only way to recover the area is to declare it untouchable and prevent human interference. For Mónica Negrete, a veterinary graduate and activist in the area, she believes that many animals may disappear as they were already endangered. She thinks the jaguar is the most likely to disappear since, without a pack, it must move to nearby areas to find food and may reach livestock areas where it could be considered a threat. There is concern that toucans, macaws, or parrots that usually migrate to Ñembi Guasu may migrate to the city due to the loss of their habitat. Some species identified as victims include:"

María José Veramendi Villa, a researcher at Amnesty International, stated that authorities should independently and scientifically investigate the causes of the fires rather than making contradictory and unfounded statements.[63] On September 15, the postgraduate unit in human development CIDES of the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés in La Paz issued a statement titled \"Chiquitanía in Flames,\"[146] adding voices for the government to declare a national disaster, as it impacts nature and the indigenous peoples of the lowlands. It also criticized how authorities are addressing this issue without considering strategic points for heritage conservation and food security, among others.[147] The College of Biologists of La Paz, supported by 80 institutions, issued a statement urging the government to declare the area a disaster zone to expedite international aid.

That same day, the Extraordinary Assembly of Cruceñidad declared a national disaster in response to the National Government's refusal and called for a large assembly in defense of the land. On September 24, Bolivian residents in the United States approached the assembly to demand that Bolivia declare a national disaster."

There are people who allegedly caused the fires deliberately. We cannot say they are settlers or community members; we even have people of Chilean nationality involved in a case in San José de Chiquitos.\" Víctor Borda, President of the Chamber of Deputies, stated: \"We do not want to prejudge, but unfortunately, it seems that some people, activists, are using and provoking these fires for political purposes, and that is a crime; they are killing biodiversity.\" In a meeting with President Evo Morales on September 3, the National Coordinator for Change (CONALCAM), an institution aligned with the government, accused Brazilians and Mennonites of being responsible. In the same statement, they said they would go to Roboré for a demonstration in defense of Mother Earth, but days later decided not to. \"We denounce that the foreignization of land, at the hands of Mennonites and Brazilians, brought this industrial logic that today causes deforestation at the expense of life, and the attempts to blame the communities hide that more than 90 percent of the deforested lands in the country end up in the hands of businesses.\" Firefighters and volunteers reported that while they extinguish the fire, settlers come from behind to reignite it. Alcohol cans were found, and many volunteers left disappointed because even one of the community members complained to the firefighters for extinguishing the fire, saying they would reignite it later. They also mentioned feeling harassed, being watched during meetings, and being followed on motorcycles. Henry Nina, leader of the Interculturals, strongly denied the accusations and pointed to ranchers and agribusinesses. Germaín Caballero, mayor of San José de Chiquitos, stated that farmers who came from Yapacaní, San Julián, and Cuatro Cañadas are the ones causing the fires. Spanish firefighters reported that the fires are being set to exploit the land, with the intention of selling meat and soy to China, and that the authorities are not doing everything possible to extinguish the fire. It is reported that some people are taking advantage of the situation to burn land because they know the government will not impose any sanctions and that there will be a \"forgiveness\" at some point in the future, allowing them to legally claim the land they burned.

Jaime Durán, Deputy Minister of Budget, assured that Bolivia has the necessary resources to handle the fire expenses, pointing out that since 2006 Bolivia has been able to take care of its problems."

                "content": "On September 24, President Evo Morales met with his international counterparts at the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and stated that all possible resources were mobilized during the fires. He suggested that authorities leave behind a fairer world and claimed that the causes of climate change are due to capitalism and mercantilism, pointing to transnational companies that control food, water, non-renewable resources, water bodies, technology, and people's personal data. He was accused of using the same rhetoric regarding the environment, despite regulations against Mother Earth existing since 2011. Pablo Solón pointed out that his speech is devalued due to its inconsistency with his actions, as he blames developed countries for the greenhouse effect while failing to comply with the Paris Agreement. According to Leonardo Tamburini, a researcher at the Center for Legal Studies and Social Research (Cejis), the Bolivian government's development model is entirely contrary to the protection of Mother Earth's rights, adhering instead to a capitalist extractivist model. He accuses the president of creating a pro-Mother Earth slogan for external audiences, while his government program lacks concrete measures in favor of nature. Actions contradicting the president's rhetoric include: seven regulations that harm the environment, the approval of 1,400 settlements in forested areas, hydrocarbon exploration and the implementation of hydroelectric projects in protected areas, mining exploitation in forest zones, the expansion of agricultural frontiers for biofuel production, roads that destroy ecosystems, authorization of genetically modified organisms, and policies that negatively impact indigenous peoples occupying the affected territories."

Government-affiliated leader Pedro Vare blamed the media for magnifying the issue, claiming it is a recurring problem every year and that measures are being taken to fight the fires. The President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, defended environmental preservation within the framework of the Paris Agreement, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. However, Cecilia Requena, a senatorial candidate, explained that there are no plans for the government to fulfill the commitments of the Paris Agreement made at COP23 in Bonn, Germany, where they pledged to reduce deforestation, a commitment ratified in 2017. This commitment contradicts the Patriotic Agenda, which proposes expanding the agricultural frontier by 10 million hectares by 2025. Gonzalo Colque, president of Fundación Tierra, stated that the territory burned is a result of this initiative. Biologist Marco Octavio Rivera considered the President's discussion of the post-fire stage unfortunate and recommended that authorities contact universities, research institutes, and park rangers who have worked for decades on forest preservation instead of holding poorly technical meetings, especially with those responsible for the fires: settler unions, development corporations, cattle ranching federations, and agribusinesses."

The weather conditions at the time were very dry. However, the wildfire is reported to have continued until April 6. The cause of the fire is believed to have been concluded as a fire accident caused by local residents burning field ridges. Due to the aftermath of the fire that day, there was also a CNG bus charging station set up at the Daejin Passenger Depot. If the fire had reached the CNG bus charging station, it was expected that it could have surpassed the 2019 Gangwon wildfire, becoming a major human-made disaster and potentially the Korean version of the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires, with the possibility of even causing significant casualties."

However, as firefighting efforts involving helicopters were halted at sunset, the flames appeared to spread slowly with the wind. According to the Busan Fire and Disaster Headquarters, the lower part of the mountain, where residential areas were concentrated, experienced less fire spread due to the focused deployment of firefighting forces. However, the fire spread overnight toward the peak of Unbong Mountain, carried by the wind. It was concluded that the flames had spread to the peak of Unbong Mountain. Initially, the burned area was reported to be 5 hectares, but it soon expanded to 13 hectares and eventually reached 20 hectares. The area turned into chaos, with flames visible from a distance. According to a testimony from a Fire Agency official, by 6:08 a.m. the next day, the wildfire containment rate had reached 90%. Additionally, the wildfire spread toward the Gochon-ri area in Cheolma-myeon, Gijang-gun. According to fire authorities, on the day of the fire, 17 firefighting helicopters (not fire department helicopters but wildfire suppression helicopters from the Korea Forest Service and leased helicopters from local governments), 29 fire trucks, and 1,200 personnel and resources were mobilized for firefighting efforts. However, due to the dry weather warning and the embers spreading with strong winds, initial containment efforts failed. As a result of the fire, evacuation orders were issued in several cases. The evacuation targets included nearby residential areas, schools, nursing homes, and facilities for people with disabilities. Dongbusan University and Unbong Middle School, which are adjacent to the wildfire site, also suspended regular classes and evacuated students and staff. As a result, the affected area was provisionally estimated to be 20 hectares of forest, with no damage to nearby residential areas or human casualties."

In total, it was estimated that the fires in the province devastated 1,300,000 hectares of fields and forests. According to biologist Esteban Dussart, a professor at the Faculty of Agronomy of the National University of La Pampa with a master's degree in biological sciences from universities in Belgium, the origin and spread of the 2017 fires were due to the lack of a concrete and rational management plan for native forests, along with political disinterest in them. The causes of these fires were associated with the conversion of land for livestock and agricultural purposes, mainly for soybean cultivation."

                "content": "During November, the first fires began, with more than 80 outbreaks reported by November 22, 2017, in various parts of La Pampa, burning around 467,000 hectares and causing the death of more than a thousand animals, according to a report by the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA). Between January 24 and 30, 2018, the devastated area increased by 174,000 hectares, totaling more than 600,000 hectares burned by the end of January. Amid the severe fires, whose poor management led the National Government to transfer control of the fires from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Security, around 300,000 hectares were burned in just one month, equivalent to 15 times the area of the entire city of Buenos Aires. Following budget cuts for fire prevention, Sergio Bergman, former Minister of Environment of the Nation and former PRO deputy, was criticized by the opposition and environmental groups for a drastic reduction in the area's budget and for stating that the most useful way to face the fire season was \"to pray,\" describing the extensive fires as \"an apocalyptic prophecy\" while forest fires also spread through the provinces of Río Negro and Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, the government of La Pampa and the Agricultural Emergency Commission (CEA) declared an agricultural emergency until June 30. By January 17, it was reported that the fires had already burned 800,258 hectares, equivalent to 40 times the area of the Federal Capital. The most affected department by January 2018 was Caleu Caleu, in the southwestern province, where La Adela is located, with more than 450,000 hectares. Other affected departments were Utracán and Chalileo, each exceeding 100,000 hectares burned. In 2017, former President Mauricio Macri transferred the Fire Management Plan to the Ministry of Security led by Patricia Bullrich. Deputy María Emilia Soria requested the interpellation of Bergman for his management of the fires. The magnitude of the environmental disaster had repercussions in international media. The origin of the fires was reportedly linked to soybean agricultural sectors that habitually burn grasslands to intentionally start fires to reduce field maintenance costs. The most significant criticisms against the national government were particularly directed at Minister Sergio Bergman for the delay in responding to the fires. The first and only firefighting plane arrived on January 1, when the situation was critical. According to information published by the Ministry of Modernization, Bergman used only 51 percent of the budget allocated to the National Fire Management System in his first year in office. Due to the handling of the fires and budget under-execution, various opposition deputies called for the minister's resignation. According to official data published by the Ministry of Modernization, only 111 million out of a total of 243 million were executed. In the case of the Environmental Control program, which performs similar functions, 80 million pesos were allocated for 2017, of which only 34 million were executed, just 42.5% of the budget allocated to the Federal Fire Management System, created by law in 2012 to prevent and combat forest and rural fires. By February 2018, the fires had caused the death of two people and more than a thousand head of cattle that month. In January 2018, after his vacation and two months of active fires, Bergman visited the area when the fire was spreading to the neighboring province of Buenos Aires, prompting criticism from various sectors. The Buenos Aires provincial coordinator of the Agrarian Federation criticized the minister's attitude, stating that \"the area needs firefighting planes, not officials with their photographers.\" It was also stated that the money should be spent on firefighting planes, not on transporting national and provincial officials with their photographers to the fire-affected area in southwestern Buenos Aires, where fires began in January 2018. Weeks earlier, during a meeting on December 28 with the agricultural board, various rural representatives had warned Buenos Aires ministers about the severity of the situation in the area due to severe droughts, but officials delayed action for more than a week. Small rural producer groups requested the National Government to respond to the damages they were suffering due to the fires in Buenos Aires, which by the end of January had devastated more than 690,000 hectares. In the following months, the minister's management was questioned, and finally, Minister Sergio Bergman was criminally charged with embezzlement of public funds in various maneuvers to hire firefighting helicopters without bidding and directly. The case was assigned to federal judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, with intervention by federal prosecutor Federico Delgado. Days later, it was revealed that a portal had exposed the direct hiring of a Spanish helicopter company despite the bidding process being underway. The company did not have authorization to fly in the country and did not meet the bidding requirements."

Six farms with residential houses, barns, and outbuildings burned down. On July 24, 1914, about 3,000 men worked to extinguish the fire, including 1,200 military personnel. Assistance was requested from the Stockholm fire brigade, which sent two steam pumps and two thousand meters of hose. Both of these pumps worked for over 400 hours. After a week, the fire was contained. The fire boundary was then Spannarboda, Hundmossen, Torshällsmossen, Norrsjön, Stenkärrsmossen, Kvarnmossen, Hallfallsmossen, Svarttjärn, St Lien, Bråten, Fall, and Spannarboda. The fire was the largest forest fire of that summer. Afterwards, a sawmill was built where the fire-damaged forest was processed.

As part of the larger threat of a \"very active wildfire season\" in the western United States, Utah was also expected to experience an above-average fire season. Drought conditions from the previous fire season, which occurred during the driest year in Utah's history, continued into the 2021 season at more extreme levels due to below-average winter rainfall. On March 17, in response to statewide drought, Governor Cox signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency. On July 4, many cities across Utah began implementing restrictions on fireworks."

It was the fastest fire recorded in Europe up to that point. It was the confirmation that a different type of fire was occurring, caused by increasingly extreme weather conditions and the lack of forest management. In addition to radically changing the landscape, it caused significant disruptions: in the economic activity of farmers, the transformation of black pine forests into farmland, and even the replacement of political references (in Solsonès, it marked the beginning of the end of CiU's hegemony)."

Around 300 firefighters and 60 fire engines were deployed. Six people were injured. Approximately 1,000 hectares burned. The following day, Sunday, the fire was declared under control, and at 10:15 a.m., INFOCAT level 1 was deactivated, although weather conditions remained adverse. Seventeen trucks and about a hundred firefighters were withdrawn. Forty-three fire engines and eight aerial units continued working. At 5 p.m., extreme weather conditions caused the flames to reignite in the Castelltallat mountain range near the Cal Sec farmhouse, advancing towards Salo and Cardona. In the latter locality, another fire was also declared, advancing towards Clariana. Within a few hours, the two fires merged into a single 25-kilometer front, far exceeding the firefighters' capacity for containment. In 12 hours, nearly 18,000 hectares burned, making it the fastest-recorded fire in Europe at the time. Around 1,000 firefighters, including volunteers, a hundred fire vehicles, a hundred ADF water tanks, and two Spanish state water bombers participated. Several homes in the Castelltallat mountain range and Salo were evacuated. On Monday the 20th, two central command points were established in Solsona and Valls de Torroella. Three French state water bombers joined the efforts. In total, 24 aerial units participated in the firefighting. Around 600 people were evacuated, many of them schoolchildren on trips staying at the Can Bayona and Can Carral houses in the municipality of Clariana de Cardener, who were relocated to the Solsona sports center. The most active fronts affected the Torregassa ridge (Solsonès), the Claret mountain range (Solsonès - Segarra), and Sant Pere Sallavinera (Anoia - Alta Segarra). On Tuesday the 21st, thanks to improved weather conditions, the fire was brought under control, and firefighting efforts focused on preventing the fire from reigniting at any of the multiple risk points. On Wednesday the 22nd, all previously closed roads were reopened, and the most violent hotspots were extinguished."

In mid-July 2022, a heatwave began that affected much of Western Europe and the United Kingdom, setting maximum temperatures across the region. The rise in temperatures caused a series of forest fires throughout Europe, and the high temperatures led to hundreds of deaths in Spain and Portugal. The United Kingdom issued its first \"red\" level temperature warning, and several cities were evacuated in Portugal and France. Climatologists linked the extreme heat to the impact of climate change, and experts predicted more frequent episodes of extreme heatwaves in Europe as a consequence of climate change. These are therefore very favorable conditions for the spread of a fire: very high temperatures, very low humidity of 15%, and a sea breeze that pushed the fire northward, where there was an abundant forested area."

The fire started in the Vallhonesta area, a population center of Sant Vicenç de Castellet. A total of 76 units of the Generalitat Firefighters were deployed, 13 of which were aerial.[10] It is a fire in a large forest area, with significant vegetation continuity, and in one of the areas most affected by drought in all of Catalonia. The fire advanced driven by the south wind, heading towards the Serra del Bitó. The fire reached the Serra dels Ermitanets. The area that could be affected is estimated to be between 1,000 and 1,500 hectares.[10] In the immediate hours after receiving the alert, efforts focused on stopping the fire's advance from the tail, targeting the right and left flanks. Regarding the latter, there was concern about a possible spread towards the center of Pont de Vilomara. The head of the fire advanced strongly and projected secondary outbreaks. Heavy machinery was also used on the tail and right flank. Technical fire maneuvers were carried out to create black zones where the fire could be mitigated.[10] The area contains numerous urbanizations and scattered settlements. According to Civil Protection, due to the proximity of the fire and smoke, residents of the municipality of Pont de Vilomara and the River Park urbanization were asked to stay indoors, and the scattered settlement of Can Riera was evacuated. At 4:30 p.m., evacuations began in areas of Pont de Vilomara closest to the fire, as well as the Les Brucades urbanization in the municipality of Sant Fruitós de Bages.[3] Additionally, Firefighters positioned vehicles to defend the Marquet Paradís and River Park urbanizations if necessary. The municipality of Pont de Vilomara activated its municipal emergency plan, evacuated the municipal pool to allow firefighters to access water, and set up a multipurpose room in case it was needed.[10] The Generalitat Firefighters' ground extinction units were joined by efforts from the Forest Action Group (GRAF), the Operational Support Group (GROS), the Active Forest Prevention Team (EPAF), and aerial resources (MAER). ADF, Civil Protection, the Red Cross, and various security and health bodies also operated in the area.[10] At 5 p.m., it was reported that the affected area already exceeded 400 hectares and that the fire had reached the Sant Llorenç del Munt i l'Obac Natural Park, an area that had been closed off by the Generalitat days earlier due to the high fire risk during the heatwave.[11] Shortly before 6 p.m., the Navarcles City Council also asked residents to stay indoors.[12] At 7 p.m., Civil Protection issued a new statement listing the affected municipalities, including El Pont de Vilomara i Rocafort, Sant Vicenç de Castellet, Sant Fruitós de Bages, Castellbell i el Vilar, and Navarcles.[13] The Chief Inspector of the Firefighters, David Borrell of the Generalitat, appeared before the media alongside the Minister of the Interior, Joan Ignasi Elena, and reported that approximately 1,200 hectares had already burned and that the fire's potential could reach up to 6,000 hectares due to the climatic conditions and strong winds in the area. They also announced that weather conditions were expected to improve starting at 8 p.m., that there were no personal injuries, although it was confirmed that the fire had reached some houses in the town of Pont de Vilomara.[4]"

                "content": "Modify - modify the code - modify Wikidata  \nThe 2022 forest fires in the Gironde department, France, are fires that, in distinct phases, primarily affected three different areas of the Gironde forest from mid-July to the end of September, requiring the intervention of several hundred firefighters from Aquitaine or other regions and even some European countries. The first fire began accidentally on Tuesday, July 12, around 3 p.m., in a plot of the La Teste-de-Buch forest, a locality bordering the southern part of the Arcachon Basin. A second fire was reported about an hour later, the same day near Landiras, in the south of the department. In the following weeks, it was in the south of Médoc that the forest faced the assault of the flames. Among other factors, the department had only received limited rainfall since August 2021. This rainfall deficit contributed to the drying out of forested areas, which, combined with the heatwave in Western Europe in July 2022, persistent drought, and stormy winds, significantly exposed the region to the risk of forest fires. The exceptional fires of July caused the evacuation of 36,750 residents and ravaged 20,800 hectares of forest (mainly pine) over nearly two weeks before the numerous resources deployed managed to contain them: the La Teste-de-Buch fire after 11 days, on July 23, and the Landiras fire supposedly fully under control two days later, on July 25. On August 9, as a result of the underground spread of the blaze through deep peat deposits, the fire reignited in Landiras and \"reappeared\" around Saint-Magne, causing the destruction of 7,400 additional hectares between the municipalities of Belin-Béliet, Hostens, Saint-Magne, and extending to the Landes municipalities of Moustey, Saugnac-et-Muret, and Mano, as well as the evacuation of several thousand residents. On Monday, September 12, in the south of the Landes du Médoc, a new fire broke out in the Saumos forest, then spread to part of the neighboring municipality of Sainte-Hélène, where several residents, exposed to smoke, had to be evacuated. This fire destroyed 3,720 hectares. On September 18, a fire burned at least 120 hectares of forest near Arès. In total, these fires burned more than 32,000 hectares of the Landes de Gascogne forest. With 13,800 hectares burned, not counting the fire's resurgence, the Landiras fire is the second largest in recent French history, behind the 1949 Landes forest fire."

This led the Prefecture of Gironde to impose water restrictions in the department starting in June 2022. On Sunday, July 17, weather conditions deteriorated in France, and fifteen departments along the Atlantic coast were declared on red alert (see Météo-France Weather Vigilance) due to the 2022 European heatwave with record temperatures expected for Monday, July 18. Fifty-one other departments were placed on orange alert."

                "content": "The fire in La Teste-de-Buch broke out around 3:00 PM on Tuesday, July 12. According to its mayor, Patrick Davet, the origin of the disaster was the result of a serious electrical problem that triggered a fire aboard a utility vehicle traveling on a forest track (Track 214), connecting the departmental road D218, near the Dune of Pilat, to the departmental road D112 leading from the main town of La Teste to the village of Cazaux. A second fire broke out an hour later in the commune of Landiras, between Hostens and Langon. On Tuesday evening, authorities evacuated five hamlets and the village of Guillos near Landiras as a precaution. Five hundred people were evacuated, and no casualties were reported in this fire. Roads D115 and D125 were closed to traffic. In the area near the fire, an evacuation of five campsites with approximately 6,000 vacationers began on July 13 as a precaution. They were relocated to the exhibition center and a shopping center in La Teste-de-Buch. Road D218 was cut off by the fire between Pilat and Biscarrosse beach. No injuries were reported. By the evening of July 12, the fire had consumed 445 hectares of forest in La Teste. By noon the next day, the affected area was estimated at 700 hectares. During the Landiras fire, 800 hectares had burned since Tuesday, July 12, and no injuries were reported. The prefecture then activated two operational command posts managed by the Gironde SDIS to coordinate operations. Nearly six hundred firefighters were mobilized to fight the fire, while volunteers from Civil Protection and the Red Cross carried out support missions for the population. Two Canadair water bombers were deployed, along with two Dash aircraft, with additional reinforcements from other regions of France. By noon, the fire in this area had reached 1,000 hectares."

                "content": "On the morning of July 14, the area of forest devastated by flames near Arcachon in the territory of the commune of La Teste-de-Buch was estimated at 1,750 hectares, with no injuries reported. Due to the configuration of the forest terrain, consisting of successive dunes, the fire was still not under control as it was difficult to access. Starting at 5 a.m., around sixty people were evacuated from an area north of the village of Cazaux. The D218 road leading from the Pilat roundabout to the Landes locality of Biscarrosse was closed. By early evening, the fire had ravaged 2,900 hectares and two houses, and campsites near Lake Cazaux were under threat. New evacuations took place in the afternoon around Cazaux, and 4,000 evacuees were initially housed at the La Teste-de-Buch exhibition center, which was quickly converted into a reception center. In Landiras, 2,100 hectares burned near Langon on Thursday morning without causing injuries. The fire was not under control, and the D115, D125, and D220 roads were closed to traffic. Guillos and the hamlets of Lahon, Hil, and Petit-Hil were evacuated. By evening, the fire had burned 2,400 hectares and was still not under control. Nearly a thousand firefighters, four Canadair planes, and two Dash planes were mobilized. The prefect, Fabienne Buccio, placed the Gironde department on orange alert due to weather conditions and the possible risk of other forest fires. On the morning of July 15, 3,150 hectares had burned in La Teste-de-Buch, and the fire had reached Lake Cazaux. Evacuations of some 10,000 people from the village continued. The La Teste-de-Buch fire was still not under control, and in Cazaux, three houses and two lakeside restaurants were destroyed. Bulldozers were brought to strategic locations to create firebreaks across the probable path of the fire. About a thousand firefighters, three Canadair planes, and one Dash plane were deployed to fight the fires in both areas that morning. Some individuals were allowed to return to spared sites, and vacationers evacuated since Tuesday from campsites in La Teste-de-Buch near the large dune returned on Friday, July 15, to retrieve their camping equipment and luggage. Most Cazaux residents were not allowed to return to check the condition of their homes or retrieve their pets. New evacuations were carried out throughout the day in Louchats, Origne, Balizac, and La Broque, with around 1,900 evacuees. The fire situation in this area remained out of control. A house in Guillos was destroyed, and other roads in the fire zone remained closed. Greece and Italy provided two Canadair planes to France. Upon their arrival, they were immediately deployed in the south of the country, which was also experiencing fires. President Emmanuel Macron visited the crisis center of the Ministry of the Interior in Paris to be briefed on the progress of the firefighting efforts. Gironde was one of 16 departments on orange alert due to the heatwave. On July 16, some Cazaux residents who had left their homes were only allowed 15 minutes to retrieve belongings and pets, while others were unable to return as their route was again threatened by fire. The La Teste-de-Buch fire was contained but still burning, with the potential to become uncontrollable if temperatures remained high and winds picked up again. Villagrains (a commune of Cabanac-et-Villagrains) was evacuated, as were 1,900 residents of Hostens. In the commune, an evacuation order was issued, but residents were not required to leave; those choosing to stay had to declare their decision. The amount of vegetation and forest burned in the two fires now totaled less than 10,000 hectares. Two new shelters were opened in Saucats and Belin-Béliet. Canadair and Dash planes dropped 6,000 liters and 10,000 liters of water and fire retardant, respectively, on the fire fronts and flanks, attempting to stop or at least slow its progression. So far, four firefighters had been injured, one fire engine overturned, and another was burned. Three thousand buildings had been saved. The president of the Gironde Departmental Council, Jean-Luc Gleyze, advocated for the local positioning of a fleet of Canadair and Dash planes to fight the fire, as some Canadair planes had been moved to other regions of France. Some arrived too late, making it more difficult to control the fire. According to him, if the La Teste-de-Buch fire could be contained between the coast and Lake Cazaux, more resources could then be transferred to Landiras. Jean-Marc Pelletant, mayor of Landiras, stated that a team of Bordeaux prosecutors had arrived and was investigating criminal activity responsible for the fire. The evacuation of 2,100 people from Cabanac (a commune of Cabanac-et-Villagrains) began on July 17, with more than 16,000 people evacuated since Tuesday, July 12. By midday, the prefecture announced that approximately 11,000 hectares had burned in the two fires. 1,500 firefighters from across France were fighting the fire. During the La Teste-de-Buch fire, 3,400 hectares were destroyed, compared to 7,200 hectares in the Landiras fire. The latter fire had a perimeter of 12 kilometers by 6 kilometers with several different advances. By midday, firebreak construction continued, with the La Teste-de-Buch fire being fought on its left and right flanks to protect campsites and homes. During the day at the Landiras fire, the DFCI continued to establish firebreaks. By evening, 3,900 hectares had burned in La Teste-de-Buch and 9,000 hectares in Landiras, after the fire situation worsened in the afternoon, with the former fire reaching the ocean at the Banc d'Arguin and turning south. In Landiras, the fire spread on multiple fronts as the wind shifted. Resources to fight the fire were increased but still needed to be deployed, with three additional planes, two hundred firefighters, and eleven other firefighting vehicles allocated. In the Landiras region, two new shelters were opened in Langon, while one was closed in Saucats. On Monday, July 18, 1,700 firefighters from across France and some neighboring countries were now mobilized to fight the fire. More than 16,000 people had been evacuated, with new evacuations planned in the Landiras region. About fifty victims were housed in shelters on the night of July 17-18. 4,300 hectares of forest had burned in La Teste-de-Buch, and 10,000 people had been evacuated. Since the morning, boating on the western part of Lake Cazaux-Sanguinet and navigation and anchoring in the southern entrance channel of the Arcachon Basin had been prohibited. Evacuations of the communes of Landiras, Budos, and Balizac were underway, with an estimated 3,500 people to be evacuated. On Tuesday, July 19, 6,500 hectares had burned in La Teste-de-Buch, and another 8,000 people were evacuated, bringing the total to approximately 20,000 people. An evacuation of a nursing home in the Dune du Pilat was completed overnight, and part of the La Teste-de-Buch zoo had to be evacuated to the Pessac zoo. In Landiras, 12,800 hectares had burned, and more than 8,000 people were evacuated, bringing the total evacuations to 14,000 people. The Flots Bleus campsite, which hosted the film \"Camping\" in 2006, was completely destroyed. In La Teste-de-Buch, 7,000 hectares of forest had already burned, and 20,000 people were evacuated. In Landiras, 13,300 hectares had burned, and preventive evacuations took place in Saint-Léger-de-Balson (about 300 people), Saint-Symphorien (about 2,000 people), and even Mano (about 130 additional people), the only commune in the Landes evacuated as a precaution against the possible spread of this fire. In Vensac, the fire started at 8:45 p.m. and had already burned 80 hectares; a campsite and a hamlet were evacuated, totaling 550 people."

Following numerous fire protection works carried out the previous day, the spread of the fires was significantly limited over the past 24 hours. For the second consecutive day, the two fires did not present any more active flame fronts and did not progress. The drop in temperatures also facilitated the firefighters' work. No additional evacuations took place on this day. A total of 36,750 people have been evacuated since the start of the fires. On July 21, the fires did not progress but were not yet under control, according to the prefecture. The first reintegrations began, with 6,000 people allowed to return to their homes.

This resurgence also resulted in the closure of the A63. Firefighters reported two injuries and six burned trucks. 1,000 firefighters were mobilized as of August 10. The evacuation of the town of Béliet, involving 2,500 people, was ordered. Reception centers were opened in the municipalities of Salles, Saint-Symphorien, and Le Barp. During a new assessment on August 11, 7,400 hectares of forest had burned. The area to be monitored covered a perimeter of 40 km, requiring the mobilization of 1,300 firefighters as well as 361 personnel and 101 vehicles deployed as reinforcements from Germany, Greece, Poland, Austria, and Romania. On August 12, 2022, German reinforcements were engaged in Belin-Béliet to address hot spots. On Sunday, August 14, 2022, the head of the SDIS 33 and the sub-prefect of Arcachon, Ronan Léaustic, announced from the VPC that all fires were now under control but not yet extinguished. A long-term effort would continue in the coming weeks to prevent any resurgence. On Wednesday, September 28, 2022, the prefect of Gironde announced in a press release that all fires were now extinguished after two and a half months of struggle."

On the other hand, in Landiras, the fire outbreak is suspected to be of criminal origin. An investigation for \"destruction by fire of woods, forest potentially causing harm to people\" is underway."

The event also stems from major demographic trends, shortcomings in land-use planning, and the limits of a primarily reactive risk management approach, based on a rapid and massive response to fire outbreaks[68]. Indeed, when urbanization is marked by the presence of numerous scattered neighborhoods and hamlets, it forces emergency services to manage the safety of thousands of people and compels them to disperse their resources to protect homes in a defensive logic, to the detriment of a more offensive strategy focused more on controlling the fire's progression[68]. In a forward-looking approach, integrating the issue of climate change, it would be useful to further mobilize land-use planning tools, which were scarcely utilized in 2022, such as Forest Fire Risk Prevention Plans (PPRIF) (only 13 municipalities across the entire Landes massif) to incorporate fire risk into long-term urban planning[68]."

The affected area extends over more than 14,000 hectares with a perimeter of 72 kilometers. The affected locations had to be evacuated, and traffic on the Northeast Highway was interrupted for about 30 hours. The Ateca fire was caused during reforestation work carried out by the company Campos Rey, subcontracted by the Dutch company Land Life Company, which aimed to reforest 200 hectares in the Monegrillo area. During these works, on July 18, 2022, a spark from one of the machines working there jumped, starting the fire that spread rapidly, burning 500 hectares on the first day, increasing to 5,500 on the second day, and reaching 14,000 hectares by July 20."

They particularly affected the Sierra de la Culebra and its surroundings. The first one started on June 15 between the areas of Ferreras de Arriba and Sarracín de Aliste, and the second on July 17 in the area of Losacio. The cause of both fires was a dry storm phenomenon. The first fire was controlled on June 24, 2022, and the second on August 14, 2022. The flames spread across the territories of 52 localities in the regions of Aliste, La Carballeda, Tábara, Tierra de Alba, and Benavente and the Valles. In the Ferreras fire, 29,670 hectares were affected. In the Losacio fire, the affected area reached 35,960 hectares. These are the two largest fires in the history of Castilla y León, and two of the most devastating in Spain since records began. Despite the starting points of both fires being more than 20 km apart, the affected areas came into contact along a 15 km line. The combined perimeter affected by both fires encompassed an area of nearly 66,000 hectares. Of this area, 34,000 hectares were of high ecological value as they belonged to the natural space of the Sierra de la Culebra, which is part of the Meseta Ibérica biosphere reserve. 48% of this natural space was consumed by the flames during the two fires, in a time span of just over a month."

                "content": "More than half of the forest mass of the Sierra de la Culebra consists of coniferous forests, as a result of successive reforestation efforts carried out during the 1950s and 1960s on highly eroded land. The resin or maritime pine species (Pinus pinaster) is the most abundant, followed by the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). To a lesser extent, there are discontinuous masses of native species such as the Pyrenean oak, holm oak, cork oak, and strawberry tree. The previous major wildfires that the Sierra de la Culebra had suffered date back to the 1990s. In particular, on July 20, 1990, due to a dry thunderstorm, a fire started between the areas of Ferreras de Arriba and Cabañas de Aliste, spreading through Las Torres de Aliste, Pobladura de Aliste, and Villardeciervos, and burned 5,000 hectares. The following year, on July 8, 1991, another fire destroyed 6,784 hectares in the central area of the Sierra de la Culebra, between the villages of Figueruela de Arriba, Linarejos, Santa Cruz de los Cuérragos, Flechas, and San Pedro de las Herrerías. Since then, more localized and smaller-scale forest fires have occurred. Unlike pyrophilic plants such as the Pyrenean oak or holm oak, which have some capacity to regrow after a fire, many pine species do not withstand fire. Their survival mechanism involves producing cones that burst open when exposed to fire, dispersing their seeds to regenerate in cleared, nutrient-rich soil once the fire is extinguished. Following the aforementioned fires of the 1990s, no reforestation or forest management plans were implemented in most of the affected areas, leading to a massive spontaneous reforestation of resin and Scots pine species over the next thirty years among dense shrubland. This resulted in the Sierra de la Culebra being populated by a very dense forest mass composed mainly of shrubland and pine forests, with a high potential for fire propagation."

Specifically, May 2022 was the second warmest and driest May in history. During June 2022, a heatwave occurred in Europe, which in Spain lasted from June 12 to June 18, being the second earliest heatwave ever recorded. The Aemet weather station in Villardeciervos recorded a maximum temperature of 35.8°C during the heatwave on June 15, while the minimum temperature during the night of June 17 to 18 was 17.5°C. In comparison, the average minimum temperature for the month of June at that weather station is 11°C. Under these circumstances, Aemet warned of an extreme fire risk starting June 14 across most of mainland Spain, particularly in the northwest of the province of Zamora. These meteorological episodes created very favorable conditions for the spread of the fire on June 15. During July 2022, another heatwave occurred in Spain, lasting from July 9 to July 19. Under these circumstances, the extreme fire risk persisted in the province of Zamora. The episodes of very high maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as minimal humidity levels, facilitated the rapid spread of the fire on July 17."

All of this, combined with the inability to use aerial resources, resulted in the fire advancing nearly 15 km in a straight line overnight and forced the evacuation of the municipalities of Cabañas de Aliste, Palazuelo de las Cuevas, Las Torres de Aliste, Pobladura de Aliste, Mahíde, San Pedro de las Herrerías, and Flechas. The high severity of the burned areas during the night in the mountain ranges of Ferreras de Arriba, Cabañas de Aliste, and Las Torres de Aliste, as well as the records of fire spread and wind direction and speed, indicate that a very intense explosive phenomenon of firestorm was generated in the early hours of the morning, where the fire created its own wind currents through a strong convective column. Unlike other areas of the fire, this sector experienced the total incineration of the existing forest mass. More than 220 people worked overnight on firefighting efforts. On the morning of the 17th, the first estimates from the emergency operation indicated an approximate burned area of 7,000 hectares, although other estimates already suggested figures of 14,000 hectares. The southerly wind forced the evacuation of the towns of Boya and Villardeciervos. During the afternoon of the 17th, weather conditions worsened, with constant southerly winds of 30 km/h, erratic behavior, and gusts of up to 70 km/h, leading to very high propagation speeds that rendered firebreak attempts and technical fire efforts ineffective. At 7:00 PM, the Villardeciervos base was evacuated. Additionally, during the afternoon of the 17th, the towns of Villanueva de Valrojo, Sagallos, Codesal, and Cional were evacuated. More than 400 people were working on extinguishing the fire, including 92 resources, 23 of which were aerial.

Villardeciervos, Villanueva del Valrojo, Ferreras de Arriba, Ferreras de Abajo, Codesal, Cional, Flechas, and Otero de Bodas remained evacuated. During the afternoon of the 18th, the fire forced the closure of the Orense-Zamora high-speed rail line. Winds of nearly 40 km/h, with strong gusts of 50 to 70 km/h, pushed the flames northward, and estimates indicated an approximate area of over 25,000 hectares burned.

The area affected by a significant degree of burning would be 25,216.6 ha. However, from the time the Sentinel-2 data was obtained until the fire was extinguished, reproductions of the fire continued to occur in initially unburned vegetation islands, so the final area affected by the fire was greater than that provided by Sentinel-2. Of the affected land, about 21,000 hectares belonged to the natural area of the Sierra de la Culebra. In the case of the Losacio fire, initial estimates indicated an affected area of between 32,000 and 34,000 ha. According to data provided by Sentinel-2 on August 4, 2022, within the Copernicus Program, the affected area is 31,473.1 ha, with a perimeter encompassing 35,960 ha.

This meant that, until June 27, the firefighting operations available in that autonomous community did not reach 25% of those planned for the high-risk wildfire season. The vice president of the Junta, Juan García-Gallardo from the Vox party, promised aid measures on social media, including the donation of jerseys by the Vuelta Ciclista a Castilla y León and the organization of a solidarity concert in the fall to raise funds. That jersey raffle only raised 250 euros, while the so-called \"benefit concert\" was not held within the planned timeframe. Additionally, the initial benefit concert was replaced in March 2023 with the announcement of a concert to be held on June 3 as a \"tribute to those affected.\" The event entailed a cost of 160,000 euros instead of raising funds to mitigate the wildfire damages, as initially announced. \"Solidarity is that residents can attend this concert for free,\" stated García-Gallardo. Following the controversy generated, some groups withdrew from the concert days later. Finally, after the withdrawal of the headlining group Fangoria—who claimed to have been announced \"without their knowledge or consent\"—the Department of Culture, Tourism, and Sports decided to cancel the concert, which has been described by local press as \"the story of a fiasco.\""

During the first week of 1954, an initial cold wave accompanied by snowfall hit the north and northeast of France. Temperatures dropped below −10°C; −16°C was recorded in Strasbourg, −18°C in Nancy, and even −30°C in Wissembourg. At the end of January and the beginning of February, a second cold wave affected the entire country. Major rivers froze, and in Dunkirk, an ice sheet formed. Temperatures reached as low as −25°C in Luxeuil-les-Bains, −21°C in Mulhouse, and −13°C in Paris. On February 5th and 6th, a snowstorm struck Languedoc-Roussillon in the extreme south of France; in two days, 85 cm of snow fell in Perpignan, 40 cm in Carcassonne, and 30 cm in Montpellier. The extreme severity of the temperatures led Abbé Pierre to make his famous radio appeal, known as the 1954 call. This appeal triggered a massive influx of donations and introduced the French to the Emmaus Movement, created in 1949, which was then in full development."

Three strong pulses of an intense cold wave occurred during the first twenty days of the month. At the Fabra Observatory, -10 °C was recorded, and in the city of Barcelona itself, it reached -6.7 °C (with the average February temperature of 1.6 °C at the Fabra Observatory, which is the lowest of any month since 1914), at Turó de l'Home -19.8 °C, -6.4 °C in Tortosa (Roquetes Observatory), and -13.5 °C in Lluc; at Estany Gento (2,150 meters above sea level), -32.0 °C was reached, the lowest temperature recorded in Spain and still unbeaten. The wave came from the British Isles and Scandinavia and affected all of Europe, with -35 °C in Saint Petersburg, -32 °C in Innsbruck, -29 °C in Moscow, and -35 °C in Munich, and rivers such as the Garonne, the Loire, the Rhine, and the Danube froze. The month of February of that year is remembered for the socioeconomic changes suffered in the counties of Girona. In the city of Girona, it reached -10.5 °C on February 3 (and especially in Empordà) as a result of the continuous cold waves (for nearly 24 consecutive days, minimum temperatures were negative, and very often below -5 °C). The most significant cold air invasions occurred between Thursday, February 2, and Sunday, February 5, and between Saturday, February 11, and Monday, February 13, 1956. Even today, contemporaries of that time call it and remember it as the Year of the Cold. The sea water froze in some coastal areas between Empordà and Roussillon. Agriculture, one of the main productive activities of the Catalan counties, was particularly affected by the cold. Much of the crops were damaged, and even now it is remembered as the year the cold killed the olive trees. The winter vegetable gardens lost their harvest, much of the cereals suffered the effects of the cold (depending on the growth stage they were in, and other aspects such as oats being more vulnerable than wheat). The episode was also very intense in Mallorca, where it is still remembered by those who lived through it as the Year of the Snow. A minimum temperature of -13.5 °C was reached, and snow depths of more than 50 cm were recorded, limits not surpassed since then. It affected all the municipalities of the island, and snow was part of the Mallorcan landscape for 17 days, from February 3 to February 20, consolidated in three waves of snowfalls. The agricultural damage was immense, as all the fields remained frozen, and it had significant economic effects since the primary sector was still of great importance at the time, as tourism had not yet consolidated, and the process of \"Balearization\" had only just begun."

The oil mills in the region worked little that year. As a result of this cold wave, the damaged olive trees were uprooted. Informatively, 62% of the area occupied by olive trees in 16 municipalities of Alt Empordà (Avinyonet de Puigventós, Boadella, Borrassà, Figueres, Garrigàs, Navata, Ordis, Pontós, Sant Miquel de Fluvià, Sant Mori, Santa Llogaia d'Àlguema, Saus-Camallera, Siurana, Taravaus, Vilamalla, and Vilaür) disappeared in the following years."

Finally, the lowest temperature recorded in December 2001 was in Das at 1,096 m altitude (-22.6 °C), a situation also caused by temperature inversion, as in the high Cerdanya mountains, the minimum temperatures were about 10 degrees higher. Since the cold was accompanied by snowfalls almost at sea level[1] and the snow froze on the roads, there were problems with communications and transport. In agriculture, olive trees in the western lands were particularly affected, as damage to vegetation occurs from -7 °C; in many cases, the aerial part of the olive trees died, but since the roots were not affected, they sprouted again later. Official aid from the Generalitat of Catalonia was provided for the agricultural damages of December 2001."

In Madrid, there was a snowfall of 20 cm, and even in Seville, it snowed, though weakly. In Palma, snow fell but did not settle on the ground. In Vitoria-Gasteiz, the temperature dropped to -13.2°C. In Reinosa (Cantabria), it reached -16°C. Molina de Aragón recorded -26.7°C on January 31, 1947. In France, this cold wave was not among the most significant of the past hundred years."

Approximately 50 cm of snow accumulated in the Bucharest area, and flights at Henri Coandă International Airport were delayed. The strong snowstorm also caused power outages, leaving 17,000 people in six counties without electricity and heating. As a result, the number of frostbite-related deaths from November to January sharply increased to 79. On the same day, a severe snowstorm with snowfall exceeding 38 cm hit northern and central Bulgaria, cutting off electricity to 1,000 villages and affecting over 10,000 people. The highway connecting Sofia to Montana was also closed. Additionally, heavy snowfall occurred in the Czech Republic, Poland, Croatia, and Serbia. On the same day, heavy snowfall in northwestern Turkey led to the cancellation of 250 flights to and from Istanbul, and schools were closed. In southern Turkey, warnings of heavy rain and flooding were issued. On January 18, heavy snowfall returned to Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Switzerland experienced record-breaking snowfall exceeding 50 cm, while Sofia, Bulgaria, saw over 40 cm of snow, with three days' worth of snow falling in just a few hours.

The cold air erupted from late January to early February, during which a blocking high pressure near Alaska prevented the Siberian high pressure from moving eastward smoothly, leading to a prolonged and abnormally cold cold wave in East Asia. Eastern China, southern China, and Taiwan experienced widespread cold, parts of South Korea and Japan saw heavy snowfall, and some areas in eastern China experienced the largest snowfall in 10 years. Even the northern mountains of Xiamen, Fujian, saw snowfall, and many regions recorded the longest-lasting low temperatures in decades."

However, in mid-January 2018, a dual blocking pattern (Atlantic-Western Europe blocking and Pacific-North America blocking) emerged in the mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, invading the polar region. This transported warm, moist air from the mid-latitudes of the two oceans to the polar region. Under the dominant effect of non-adiabatic heating, the polar region rapidly warmed, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) phase turned negative, the polar vortex weakened and split, and cold air accumulated continuously in Siberia, resulting in an abnormally strong Siberian high-pressure system accompanied by a strong East Asian horizontal trough. Later in the month, the East Asian horizontal trough turned vertical, guiding cold air southward to invade China, triggering a cold wave. \n\nAt the same time, due to the La Niña (anti-El Niño) phenomenon, a high-pressure system formed near Alaska, moving slowly and creating a blocking high-pressure system. This forced the Siberian high-pressure system to shift southward and slow down, causing a large-scale temperature drop in East Asia. The cooling persisted until early February, forming a gradual cold wave. The timing of low temperatures varied across regions. In Hong Kong, temperatures below 10°C were recorded starting January 29, with the lowest temperature of this cold wave recorded on February 1. In Taipei, temperatures below 10°C were not recorded until February 3, with the lowest temperature of this cold wave recorded on February 5. Both Taipei and Hong Kong experienced consecutive days of temperatures below 10°C, which ended on February 7."

It is estimated that with sufficient moisture, humidity, and temperature, there is a possibility of snowfall in mountains above 1,000 meters in altitude.\" Affected by the cold wave, 49 people died suddenly from the cold within less than a day from February 2 to 3. On February 4, a low temperature of 7.8 degrees Celsius was recorded in Xinwu District, Taoyuan, and 7.9 degrees Celsius in Hsinchu. Snow also fell on Datun Mountain, which is just over 1,000 meters above sea level. Snowfall began on Taiping Mountain on February 3, and accommodations were not provided on February 4 and 5. Matsu experienced its first snowfall in 16 years. The next day, Hsinchu recorded a low temperature of 6.3 degrees Celsius, and Xinwu recorded 6.4 degrees Celsius. From February 2 to the morning of February 5, 120 people had died suddenly, and combined with the 134 sudden deaths from January 29 to the morning of February 1, a total of 254 sudden deaths had occurred across Taiwan as of the morning of February 5. Agricultural losses were estimated at 3.23 million. Although the impact gradually diminished on February 6, radiation cooling caused the lowest temperatures in central and southern Taiwan to be lower than the previous day. Chiayi recorded a low temperature of 6.9 degrees Celsius. Morning temperatures in flat areas returned to above 10 degrees Celsius, but Hsinchu experienced 69 consecutive hours of temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius, and Banqiao in New Taipei experienced 64 consecutive hours of temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the low temperatures affected the rescue efforts for the Hualien earthquake on February 7. Temperatures gradually rose afterward, but starting on February 10, another wave of dry and cold air caused temperatures to drop again before returning to normal levels. On the morning of February 12, Tamsui in New Taipei recorded a low temperature of 9.1 degrees Celsius. On February 13, the only low temperature below 10 degrees Celsius in flat areas was recorded in Tamsui, which was far from the Central Weather Bureau's earlier estimate of 6 degrees Celsius and the Japan Meteorological Association's estimate of 4 degrees Celsius."

Finally, the temperature dropped back to around -20°C on Monday, while the December average is -6.3°C. \"The weather is yo-yoing, and it's simply a transition as winter tries to take hold,\" said meteorologist Dave Phillips on CBC. An extreme cold alert was also issued in Toronto. \"Hypothermia occurs when body temperature falls below 35°C and has serious consequences such as organ failure and death. Frostbite can also occur in cold weather when the skin freezes, and in the most severe cases, amputation is necessary when deeper tissues are affected,\" said the city in a statement. In the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, temperatures range between -21 and -27°C according to Environment Canada."

It was the longest heat wave experienced in Argentina since the heat wave in 2013, primarily affecting the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba, and all the northern provinces where multiple cities recorded record temperatures. It was characterized as an unusual heat phenomenon, not only because of its duration but also due to the magnitude of temperatures during the month it occurred, as in March in Argentina, temperatures typically decrease with the onset of autumn. The heat wave is associated with the Atlantic anticyclone, an extremely intense new La Niña phenomenon in the Pacific, and the regional effects of climate change. A heat wave is characterized by a marked and sustained increase in temperatures, especially maximum temperatures, occurring in several cities above what is considered extreme."

The rivers nearly dried up, causing water mills to stop working, so grain could not be ground and bread could not be baked. Occasionally, \"bad weather\" brought some relief, but also fatal fires. Rivers dried up, and in Cologne, the Rhine also ran dry. In Paris, people walked across the bed of the Seine without getting their feet wet. Forest and heath fires were a daily occurrence, but village centers and even some cities also caught fire. It was exceptionally dry and hot: between March and August, there was hardly any rain, and especially from April to July, it was extremely warm. In July, not a single drop fell in several places. In many areas, people began planting grapes for wine. But this was not successful, as three bad summers followed this warm one. Even after the summer, the sunny, warm, and dry weather continued. Even in October 1540, the sun and warmth returned, and apart from a few brief rain showers, it remained dry and sunny until the end of the year."

An initial heatwave hit the western regions of the country from June 25, with temperatures nearing or exceeding 40°C locally in Montana, Washington State, Arizona, Nevada, and California. In the following days, the phenomenon intensified, and record values were recorded in southern Nevada and western Arizona. On July 5, 43°C was recorded in Reno, breaking the previous record from 1970, while 47°C was recorded in Las Vegas. A heat peak was recorded in Baker, California, where the mercury rose to 51°C. In Las Vegas, as in several other cities in the region, the intensive use of air conditioners caused a series of power surges on the electrical grid, leaving entire neighborhoods without power. In Reno, the Salvation Army opened an emergency shelter for people without air conditioners. A one-year-old child found dead in a car in Orofino, Idaho, was one of the first victims of the heatwave to be reported. The drought and extreme temperatures caused several fires to break out. In Utah, 1150 km² of vegetation were destroyed by flames, forcing authorities to evacuate some homes and close access to highways I-15 and I-70. Three people died as a result of the disaster. After a period of relative respite, a new heatwave hit the country starting July 9, this time reaching the Midwest plains, the South, and part of the East Coast. States like Tennessee and Missouri were particularly affected by the phenomenon, with temperatures nearing 40°C recorded in several localities. On July 11, 37.7°C was recorded in some localities in New Jersey. To limit accidents, the New York City municipality decided to open nearly 300 air-conditioned emergency centers. On August 16, Tennessee authorities announced a toll of nine deaths, while the Missouri Department of Health reported seven victims. In Illinois, eight people died as a result of this heatwave."

During the year 1947, temperatures were consistently above average from April to early October. Europe experienced three notable heatwaves (21 days): from June 26 to 28 (low intensity), from July 22 to August 4 (exceptional intensity), and from August 14 to 20 (moderate intensity)[1]. The spring had been abnormally warm, with unusual temperatures starting in April, as 30°C was reached in many regions of France during the second half of the month, and even exceeded in the south. On May 27, Saharan air invaded France with temperatures exceeding 30°C in the northern half and approaching 35°C in the southern part. After a respite in mid-June, a first heatwave hit Europe during the last decade of June. In France, between June 26 and 28, 35°C was exceeded in much of the country. After a break in mid-July, a new heatwave—comparable to the August 2003 heatwave—occurred from July 22 to August 4. According to Météo-France, it was \"the most intense heatwave episode since the post-war period, after the August 2003 heatwave,\" ... and even since 1873, the date from which Météo-France's chronological data begins. In some places, such as the Paris region, absolute records were observed: on July 28, 1947, 40.4°C was reached. This record would only be broken 72 years later, on July 25, 2019, with 42.6°C [2]. \n\nIn southern France, the peak of the heatwave was reached on August 2 and 3, with 40°C in Lyon and even higher further south. On August 3 and 4, storms brought an end to this heatwave. But a new, more moderate wave occurred between August 14 and 20: 35 degrees were again exceeded throughout France, except along the coasts. A final wave took place during the second decade of September, with maximum temperatures still exceeding 30°C in most weather stations. In 1947, the heat was certainly less concentrated than in 2003, and the humanitarian consequences were less critical for a population less exposed. However, the episodes of intense heat in 1947 were never as widespread since the beginning of records. The Alpine glacier systems then recorded historic losses, which they would not be able to recover from thereafter."

                "content": "The heatwave of July 1994 was the most significant heatwave of the 1990s and the most important since the heatwave of July 1982. Central Catalonia, mainly Bages and Berguedà, was the area that suffered the most from the catastrophic forest fires, burning nearly 45,000 hectares, and where the highest temperature values in Catalonia were recorded. The heatwave began in the last days of June, reaching its peak between July 3 and 5. It affected all of Catalonia but was especially intense in the Terres de Ponent, Central Catalonia, the pre-coastal area, and the pre-Pyrenean valleys of Pallars Jussà and Alt Urgell. In these areas, thermometers soared above 40°C, a value rarely reached in Catalonia and not every summer. On July 4, 1994, 43.0°C was recorded in Montblanc and Esparreguera, and 42.5°C in Manresa and Piera. Even in elevated areas of the Pyrenees, temperatures reached very high values, such as 25°C on July 1 at the 2,041 m altitude of the Boí-Taüll ski resort. A new, less intense heatwave affected all of Catalonia again in mid-month, with maximum temperatures once again reaching 40°C in the hottest parts of the country, but this time especially affecting the northeastern regions and the Central Coast, where sea breezes had tempered the temperature during the first heatwave of the month. In these areas, the absolute maximum temperature of that month was then reached. During those days in July 1994, a bubble of very hot air of Saharan origin affected much of the Iberian Peninsula and the southwestern area of Europe, with temperatures at 850 hPa reaching 30°C over Andalusia, 25°C in the Ebro Valley, 22°C in the Pyrenees, and 20°C in the Alps between July 3 and 4, 1994. The entry of this very hot air mass was facilitated by a southern wind flow at all levels caused by a significant ridge at 500 hPa centered over the Alboran Sea and extending to Scandinavia. The following maps show the 20CRP (NCAR-NCEP, USA) reanalyses for 07/03/1994 at 18 UTC of the geopotential height and temperature fields at 500 hPa (top image) and 850 hPa (middle image), as well as the sea-level pressure and 2 m temperature fields (bottom image). The two heatwaves of July 1994 resulted in a significant thermal anomaly at 850 hPa over the Iberian Peninsula and much of Europe, as well as a significant positive anomaly in geopotential height at 850 hPa over Scandinavia. Monthly temperature values at 850 hPa exceeded 3.5°C above the climatic average for the 1948-2013 period over the Valencian Community and the Terres de l'Ebre, and exceeded 4°C in northern Germany. The average geopotential height field at 500 hPa also shows a clear dominance of southern wind circulation in Western Europe, thus favoring the entry of warm air from the Sahara into the Iberian Peninsula and Western Europe for much of the month. This configuration is very different from the predominant one during July across Western Europe, with a circulation of predominantly westerly winds. The winter and spring of 1994 had been very dry in much of the country. Accumulated precipitation was clearly below the climatic average, especially in spring (in Berguedà and Bages, it had rained half of what is usual). Therefore, at the beginning of the summer of 1994, the forests of Catalonia were in a state of significant water stress. The extremely high temperatures recorded in the interior of the country as a result of the great heatwave, combined with low humidity due to the moderately intense dry southern wind that blew during those days, facilitated the occurrence of the devastating forest fires in Catalonia in 1994."

It was the second massive heatwave to hit the region during 2009 (see Heatwave in Australia 2009), with the worst-affected states being South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. The heatwave at the turn of January-February 2009 was indeed even more intense, but according to the Australian weather service, it was unprecedented in terms of intensity so early in the summer season. In many places, record-high temperatures for November were measured, locally over 45 degrees C. However, it was primarily the duration that made the heatwave unique. Temperatures of around 40 degrees C or more have indeed been recorded many times in November in the affected areas, but the heat has usually lasted only a few days. In this case, many locations experienced such high temperatures for over a week, with daytime temperatures 10-15 degrees above normal. Just like during the heatwave 10 months earlier, the cause of the warm weather was a powerful, stationary high-pressure system over the Tasman Sea, which led to very warm air from central Australia flowing down over the southeastern part of the country. The winter of 2009 had been extremely warm in Australia, and very high temperatures were already recorded in the region at the end of October. However, the heatwave is considered to have started on November 6 and ended only on November 19-20."

A spokesperson for the environmental group Climate Emergency Action Network claimed that the current heatwave is a clear example of \"climate change weather,\" i.e., extreme weather events that can be expected as the climate becomes increasingly warmer. However, the weather service emphasized, as usual, that an unusually intense individual heatwave does not prove anything. On the other hand, they argue that it is indisputable that Australia has warmed faster than the global average and that heatwaves have become both more frequent and longer. Additionally, large parts of the continent have been affected by very severe drought during the 21st century."

Although it was a record-breaking heatwave at the time, three years later in 2010, temperatures significantly surpassed those of this year, setting the highest temperatures in recorded history. As a result, the 2007 heatwave became less prominent and faded from memory.

                "content": "The rainy season in 2007 tended to be delayed across Japan. The start of the rainy season was delayed nationwide, except for southern Kyushu, averaging 8.6 days later than usual, and the end of the rainy season was delayed by 5.4 days compared to the average, except for southern Kyushu and the Nansei Islands. Before the rainy season began, it was predicted that the rainy season would be short and the summer would be hot due to the effects of the La Niña phenomenon. However, in reality, the rainy season was delayed due to factors such as the weak influence of the Pacific high-pressure system. \n\nAs a result of the delayed rainy season, July experienced low temperatures and heavy rainfall, except for southern Kyushu and the Nansei Islands, with average temperatures in Honshu and Hokkaido being 0.8-1.7°C lower than usual. However, after the rainy season ended and August began, the Pacific high-pressure system strengthened, leading to stable sunny weather and a shift from a trend of low temperatures to high temperatures. By mid-August, the number of locations observing extreme heat days with maximum temperatures of 35°C or higher rapidly increased from the Kanto region to Kyushu. On August 15, a temperature of 40.2°C was recorded in Tatebayashi City, Gunma Prefecture, marking the first time that year a temperature of 40°C or higher was observed. The following day, August 16, temperatures of 40.9°C were recorded in Kumagaya City, Saitama Prefecture, and Tajimi City, Gifu Prefecture, breaking the previous record of 40.8°C observed in Yamagata City, Yamagata Prefecture, on July 25, 1933, for the first time in 74 years. After this, temperatures began to drop gradually from the north, but high temperatures persisted until late August. The average monthly temperature for August was 0.6-1.3°C higher than usual across a wide area from Hokkaido to Kyushu, and about 0.3°C higher in the Nansei Islands. The average temperature for the entire summer (June to August) was 0-0.8°C higher than usual nationwide.\n\nFrom late August to early September, temperatures temporarily dropped due to autumn rains and Typhoon No. 9, but high temperatures continued in areas south of the autumn rain front. From mid-September onward, the autumn rain front weakened, and the Pacific high-pressure system and migratory high-pressure systems broadly covered areas near Japan, while the westerly jet stream meandered significantly northward near Japan. As a result, low rainfall and high temperatures persisted, and some regions experienced record-breaking heat for September. By late September, the heat subsided in areas north of the Hokuriku and Kanto regions due to the southward movement of the autumn rain front, but high temperatures continued in regions further south. The average monthly temperature for September was 0.4-0.8°C higher than usual in the Nansei Islands, 0.9°C higher in Hokkaido, 1.6-2.1°C higher in the Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, and Kinki regions, and 2.2-2.5°C higher in the Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu regions.\n\nAround mid-August, many people across Japan were hospitalized due to heatstroke. Dozens of deaths were reported, most of whom were elderly individuals staying at home, highlighting the issue of ensuring the health and safety of the elderly during extreme heat."

                "header": "Reason",
                "content": "The factors behind the intense heat in mid-August include the position and strength of the Pacific High, as well as the continuation of stable weather. It is believed that the Pacific High was shifted northeast compared to usual years, and in central Japan, which was near the center of the high-pressure system, a \"tall high-pressure system\" covered the area from the surface to the upper atmosphere. This was likely due to the La Niña phenomenon and sea surface temperature fluctuations in the Indian Ocean, which activated convective activity near the Philippines. Warm air rose actively near the Philippines, flowed into the vicinity of the Pacific High, descended, and strengthened the Pacific High while warming its interior. Additionally, the Tibetan High was shifted northward. The meandering of the subtropical jet stream (westerlies) caused it to flow northward near Japan, allowing the Pacific High and Tibetan High to extend significantly northward near Japan. The Tibetan High overlapped the Pacific High, broadly and deeply covering the area near Japan. This state persisted for about a week, preventing the heat accumulated during the day from fully dissipating at night, gradually raising the baseline temperature and creating the foundation for record-breaking heat. \n\nIn regions that experienced particularly high temperatures, geographical factors also played a significant role. Cities like Tajimi and Mino are located in basins, while Kumagaya and Tatebayashi are inland areas of plains surrounded by mountains, making them prone to temperature increases due to the Foehn effect. Additionally, areas located in valleys surrounded by high mountains on two sides likely became heat traps due to converging winds. The heat island effect in the Chukyo and Tokyo metropolitan areas, as well as the blocking of convection (such as sea and land breezes or mountain and valley winds) by skyscrapers acting as \"walls,\" are also considered significant factors. \n\nThe active convective activity near the Philippines continued into September, sustaining the strength of the Pacific High. Combined with the northward meandering of the subtropical jet stream, the straightening of the polar jet stream (which rarely descended southward near Japan), and the northward shift of the Tibetan High, the intense heat in Japan persisted into September. \n\nRegarding the relationship between this heatwave and global warming, changes in atmospheric circulation (airflow) and ocean circulation influenced by global warming, as well as the baseline increase in average temperatures, have been pointed out."

It was the second longest heat wave experienced in Argentina since records began in 1906, affecting at least 52 cities across the country. For the first time since the creation of the heat alert system, a red-level alert was in effect for several consecutive days both in the city of Buenos Aires and in the city of Rosario in Santa Fe. The cause of this heat wave was the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which caused the South Atlantic anticyclone to settle over the continent, creating an atmospheric blockage that led to high temperatures and scarce rainfall in the central and northern parts of the country, while halting subpolar and subtropical frontal systems, resulting in unusual summer snowfalls in Tierra del Fuego and torrential rains in Brazil."

From the 19th, this anomalous situation began to expand towards northern Argentina and intensified again over the central part, affecting 18 provinces, subsiding around December 30 in the central part and between January 1 and 2 in the far north of the country with the passage of a cold front that caused a change in the air mass. As a result, most localities located between 30°S and 40°S recorded 1 or 2 heatwaves during the period, with durations ranging from 5 to 18 consecutive days, and average minimum temperatures exceeding 4°C and average maximum temperatures exceeding 6°C compared to the normal for the season. The long persistence of this heatwave (22 days) made the event exceptional, breaking several records regarding the highest number of consecutive days with minimum and maximum temperatures above the average in several meteorological stations in the affected area. The National Meteorological Service reported, through its daily updates, information on the development of the heatwave.

This occurs in exceptional cases of heat waves, which can affect all healthy people, not just at-risk groups. Up to that point, several deaths had been recorded with heat stroke episodes as direct causes of death. In Santiago del Estero, eleven deaths associated with heat stroke occurred. In Entre Ríos, seven more cases were reported, largely due to cardiorespiratory arrests and decompensations caused by the intense heat, as well as one fatality from heat stroke in the district of Avellaneda, and in the province of Salta, one fatality was reported due to sunstroke. In various locations, several drownings were also recorded (largely due to thermal shock) as people attempted to cool off in some rivers in the provinces of Córdoba (9 cases), Santa Fe (4 cases), Buenos Aires (5 cases), Entre Ríos (4 cases), Mendoza (3 cases), Corrientes (4 cases), San Luis (1 case), Salta (1 case), Santiago del Estero (1 case), and Jujuy (1 case). In the city of Buenos Aires, two people died from carbon monoxide poisoning after turning on a generator to alleviate the intense heat at night. The following day, a similar case occurred, where a 50-year-old man lost his life for the same reason, and several days later, an elderly person was found dead in their apartment in the Villa del Parque neighborhood due to power outages and the intense heat. In the district of Avellaneda, three people died in a fire while trying to light the place with candles since they had no electricity due to power outages. Meanwhile, for the same reason, four people died in a house fire in Quilmes, and one more person in the city of Buenos Aires. In the city of Pergamino, an elderly person also fell victim to a fire caused by an electrical failure in a ventilation device. Also in the city, SAME recorded a peak in emergency calls; most of the emergencies were related to fainting and low blood pressure, typical symptoms of heat stroke, and because pre-existing health conditions worsened, such as the emergence of a dengue outbreak in a region as southern as the province of Entre Ríos, a large province where such disease (dengue in Argentina is almost always a zoonosis carried by people who have previously been in much more northern areas than Argentina). In Rosario, 70 swimmers cooling off in the Paraná River on Christmas Day were attacked by a school of piranhas, carnivorous fish of the genus Serrasalmus —to which piranhas also belong—. These fish were fleeing to cooler areas due to the high water temperatures caused by the heat wave. The following day, another attack by these fish occurred at a beach on the Paraná River in Posadas (Misiones), injuring 15 people."

Additionally, on December 28, it recorded a power demand record for a Saturday, with electricity consumption reaching 21,264 megawatts at 2:10 PM. As a consequence of the relentless heat, there were heavy rains with strong electrical activity in several localities in the central part of the country, and San Miguel de Tucumán experienced high wind activity. On New Year's Eve, the city of Rosario experienced a heat index of 55°C."

                "content": "On December 23, Buenos Aires legislator Marcelo Ramal presented a bill for an electricity emergency in the City of Buenos Aires. This initial project proposed the creation of a crisis committee composed of: one representative from each legislative bloc, representatives from the consultative councils of the Communes and affected neighborhoods, elected representatives of workers and technicians from energy distributors, and academics from the Faculty of Engineering at UBA. The committee would have authority over the distribution companies and would organize an energy restoration operation. The project included the formation of 60 emergency crews (4 per commune) to repair damaged lines and substations, as well as the provision of 1,500 generators (100 per commune). The costs related to these operations would be financed through a tax on gambling establishments in the City, which are currently exempt. However, only five legislators (in addition to Ramal, Gustavo Vera, Virginia González Gass, Pablo Bergel, and Alejandro Bodart, the latter two with their own projects) signed the request for the Legislature to hold a special session to address this issue. The project was ignored by the remaining legislators, prompting the five signatories to hold a press conference. Chief of Staff Jorge Capitanich pointed to the electricity providers, Edenor and Edesur, as responsible for the outages and urged users to direct their complaints to the companies. He announced an administrative holiday for December 30 starting at 12 p.m. Working groups were created within the framework of the climate emergency, unifying the tasks of security forces (police, army, civil defense, and firefighters) with the availability of 500 patrol cars, 17,000 agents, and 3,200 cameras. Days later, the head of government of the City of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, declared an energy emergency due to the energy collapse affecting his city. Similarly, Capitanich announced the executive branch's intention to nationalize the management of the electricity service if Edenor and Edesur did not resolve the supply issues. When asked about Nicolás Caputo, a shareholder in Edesur and the main beneficiary of public works in Buenos Aires, responsible for the power outages, he avoided responding or referencing the responsibility of energy distribution companies like Edesur, owned by his close friend with whom he shares business interests. As a result of the prolonged power outages, numerous protests occurred due to public discontent in most neighborhoods of the City of Buenos Aires, disrupting traffic on streets, highways, and bridges. One of the most affected roadways by the protests was the Buenos Aires-La Plata Highway, where a total vehicle collapse was recorded. In the city, there were various demonstrations by residents, including street and avenue blockades. By the first days of January 2014, some neighborhoods in the City of Buenos Aires had been without electricity for more than two weeks, leading residents to block the Sarmiento railway line as a form of protest, as well as in the Province of Buenos Aires. Ramal, the author of the law proposing the energy emergency, criticized Macri's measure, considering that \"what Macri did is a caricature of an energy emergency, not a real emergency,\" as \"no extraordinary measures were taken to restore the service nor resources allocated to address an emergency.\" The national and city governments agreed to coordinate assistance tasks for residents who remained without power. Mauricio Macri himself requested a change in the time zone for the City of Buenos Aires, the Argentine coast, and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Córdoba. The National Minister of Planning, Julio De Vido, strongly rejected the proposal, explaining that \"having two time zones would cause disruptions and costs greater than the benefits, as it would not be logical, for example, to have one time in Córdoba and another in Santiago del Estero.\" The Minister of Planning then asked \"Argentine companies\" with shares in Edesur to \"take responsibility as Argentines\" for the power outages. \"I am referring to the Caputo Group, Escasany Group, Miguens Bemberg Group, Guillermo Reca, and Guillermo Vázquez.\""

It was publicly reported that the companies under-executed investments for which they had resources amounting to 240 million pesos, through the Infrastructure Fund, \"as a form of extortion to achieve a tariff increase.\" The planning minister warned that, due to \"negligence and serious non-compliance\" in service during the heatwave, distribution companies would have to pay 490 pesos to residential users who were without power for 12 to 24 hours. Edesur was required to compensate users with a total of 221 million pesos, while Edenor had to compensate them with 77 million. After the outages caused by the heatwave, starting in 2014, Edenor initiated an investment plan that allowed for a 32% reduction in outages."

The mercury still reached 48°C in Phoenix and 47°C in Las Vegas. During the night, the mercury fluctuated between 20 and 35°C, which posed a real danger to the human body, unable to cool down at any time. However, the relative humidity was exceptionally low, often below 10%, making the extreme heat more \"bearable.\" During this heatwave, forecasters recorded 46°C in Phoenix, 42°C in Tucson, and 43°C in Las Vegas by midday on a Saturday, but it was expected that the mercury would rise further in the afternoon. At noon, the thermometer read 45°C in Death Valley, at Furnace Creek. Death Valley is one of the hottest places on the globe."

Thus, there were two depressions located on either side of an anticyclone. On their western equatorial periphery, the high pressures carried very hot and humid air from Mexico in a south to southwest flow, which dried out and warmed further due to the foehn effect as it passed over the Rocky Mountains. As a result, in the plains, there was a completely clear sky, sunny weather, and extremely high temperatures, most exceeding 40°C and approaching 50°C."

Numerous cases of hospitalizations were reported, including 34 in Las Vegas at an outdoor concert due to sunburns and heatstrokes, while 170 others suffered from nausea and exhaustion. The extreme heat made roads and sidewalks extremely hot. Authorities feared that migrants attempting to cross the border illegally between Mexico and the United States might die in the desert; consequently, reinforcements were deployed to monitor the border on the U.S. side. Seven people were found dead in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona. An elderly person was discovered dead in their home in Las Vegas, as they did not have air conditioning. In Oregon, about forty sheep succumbed to the heat, while more than 200 other animals had to be rescued. The paws of dogs and cats had to be protected from burns caused by the scorching asphalt. Additionally, and particularly in California, the extreme heat hindered airplane takeoffs, leaving them grounded. Numerous fires were reported, including a massive one in California that caused the death of 19 firefighters who were trying to combat the blaze. This extreme heatwave was one of the most intense ever observed in the world: temperatures close to some of the world's heat records were recorded in certain states."

                "content": "The heatwaves of the summer of 2003 made it the hottest summer in Catalonia for at least the previous 100 years, with average air temperature anomalies exceeding 4°C compared to the 1961-1990 climatic average. In Western and Central Europe, the summer of 2003 was considered the hottest since the year 1500. The major heatwaves of the summer of 2003 peaked during the first half of August and were caused by the persistence of synoptic situations with advection of hot Saharan air from North Africa (see the reanalyses at 850 hPa below). Additionally, these situations were exacerbated by prior conditions of extreme soil and vegetation dryness due to a prolonged drought in the spring and early summer. As a result of this dryness, almost all of the Sun's radiation was converted into heat, as it could not be absorbed by the soil and vegetation. The predominant zonal circulation pattern (west-east) over Europe shifted slightly, generating a more meridional (south-north) circulation with a higher geopotential height, leading to elevated temperatures and atmospheric stability conditions during the summer of 2003 across Western and Central Europe. Temperatures at 850 hPa that summer were 3°C higher than the 1948-2012 climatic average."

Many extreme maximum temperature records and persistence of high temperatures were surpassed. As a result of the heatwaves, more than 30,000 people died across Europe, most of them vulnerable elderly individuals, and nearly 650,000 hectares burned in over 25,000 fires that occurred across the continent. The heat also led to a loss of glacier volume in the Alps on the order of 5-10% (European Climate Assessment and Dataset, ECA&D). The heat affected Western and Central Europe (especially France), with temperatures exceeding 40°C in much of the Iberian Peninsula and France. In the Portuguese region of Alentejo, temperatures reached 47.3°C, while in numerous cities in southern Spain, temperatures exceeded 45°C, with a maximum of 46.2°C in Córdoba. In Catalonia, in Vinebre, in the Ribera d'Ebre, the country's maximum value of 42.2°C was reached on August 13, 2003. At Girona airport, temperatures reached 41.2°C, and at Barcelona airport, 37.3°C."

                "content": "Around June 23–26, a high-pressure bridge formed from the Azores High to the departing Central Europe High Zoe, from which, under the influence of a low-pressure system over the British Isles (Quintus), the High Annelie developed around June 29, later shifting over the Baltic Sea. Spain was particularly affected by the heatwave in its early stages, where heat records were already set at the end of June 2015 with temperatures reaching up to 43°C. Nationwide heat warnings were in effect from June 25, with at least the second warning level issued from June 28. In Algeria and Morocco, temperatures repeatedly exceeded 40°C, even along the coast. Portugal, however, was comparatively affected only briefly. Other parts of Western Europe also recorded unusually high maximum air temperatures. In France, numerous local record temperatures of just under 40°C were noted, with temperatures along the Channel coast being up to 20°C above the long-term average for this time. At London Heathrow Airport, a temperature of 36.7°C was measured on July 1, 2015, surpassing the previous July record for the UK. In the Netherlands, July 2 saw the hottest July day ever recorded, with 38.2°C in Maastricht, marking the third-highest temperature ever measured in the country. The heat quickly spread to western Central Europe. In Germany, all-time record temperatures were measured at many stations, surpassing the values from the summer of 2003. In Karlsruhe, 40.8°C was recorded on July 5, 2015, by the Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research. However, as the German Weather Service (DWD) had ceased measurements at this location on November 1, 2008, these values are not considered official. The DWD measured 40.3°C in Kitzingen, which at the time was the highest temperature ever recorded in Germany since the start of comprehensive weather records in 1881, narrowly surpassing the previous record of 40.2°C. Switzerland experienced one of the most extreme heat weeks from July 1–7 in 150 years, alongside 2003 and 1947. Unusually high temperatures were also recorded in northern Sweden due to strong southern airflows, with a new high of 32.8°C in Forse, Ångermanland (southern Norrland), on July 2. Elsewhere, temperatures exceeded 30°C in both northern and southern Sweden until July 5. In early July, the center of Annelie shifted over Poland, and the heatwave reached eastern Central Europe with peak values around 35°C in Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. However, the all-time record temperatures of the 2013 heatwave were not reached here. Severe thunderstorms developed from the west along the incoming cold front of the next low-pressure system, Siegfried, over the British Isles. In the South Westphalia region, hailstones the size of tennis balls were reported. However, the thunderstorms did not bring significant cooling. Following the front, the European sub-core of the high-pressure complex was named Bigi. From July 7, the heat intensified over eastern Central Europe, Italy, and the Balkans, as a strong cold front from the subsequent North Sea low Thompson, which ended the heatwave, pushed the hot air masses of Western Central Europe ahead of it. Record values were now measured from the Swiss Plateau to the Pannonian Plain. Geneva recorded 39.7°C, the highest value ever measured for the northern side of the Alps. Innsbruck registered a new high of 38.2°C on July 7, while Lugano (25.4°C on July 7) and Vienna (26.9°C on July 8) recorded their warmest nights since measurements began. Seibersdorf recorded the highest early morning temperature ever measured in Austria (30.4°C at 8 a.m.). In Hungary, values exceeding 39°C surpassed local 60-year-old records from the summer of 1957 (39.3°C in Budakalász, Pest). Towards the Black Sea and the Aegean, the heatwave lasted only one to two days with temperatures up to nearly 40°C (Bucharest, July 9), but severe weather warnings were also issued here. The cold front moving over the Alps caused severe storms in central and southern Germany, western and southern Austria, northern Italy, and the Hungarian Plain. In Tyrol (Innsbruck 141 km/h), Carinthia, and also central Hungary, where the greatest heat had recently prevailed (Aszód, PE, 131 km/h), wind gusts reached hurricane strength, leading to windthrow, traffic disruptions, and power outages. Hailstones up to the size of golf balls were reported from Saxony-Anhalt and the Villach–Gailtal area, causing extensive roof damage in some regions. Styria recorded downpours of up to 65 liters in a few minutes. Between Dolo and Mira near Venice, a tornado of category 3/EF4 caused devastation. A reported tornado in Framersheim (Rhineland-Palatinate) might have been a downburst."

                "content": "After this front, the heat retreated to the Mediterranean region, with the heatwave in Spain entering its third week. On July 6, temperatures exceeded 45 degrees in the lower Guadalquivir region up to the interior of the Valencia province (Córdoba Observatory, Andalusia, 45.2°C), and on July 7 (Zaragoza Airport, Aragon, 44.5°C; Murcia, Murcia, 43°C), numerous locations recorded the highest values since weather records began in the 1920s. In terms of temperature, duration, and extent, it surpassed the heatwaves of 2012 and 1991 by early July and became the second most severe heatwave since 1975, after 2003. With high-pressure system Clara and the low-pressure systems Thompson and Ulrich, normal summer weather returned to Central Europe, bringing a brief slight relief to Spain with cold fronts. Along the Alpine edge, these caused severe thunderstorms in the Salzburg region. From July 11, temperatures in central and southern Spain again widely approached the 40-degree mark. Subsequently, the high-pressure system, named Dietlinde, expanded back towards Central and then Eastern Europe. Temperatures there also quickly rose above 35 degrees. On July 16, the heatwave in Spain eased with the arrival of a cold front (temperatures now up to slightly above 35 degrees), while the Scirocco began in the Maghreb (Tunisia up to 41°C). France recorded a new national peak for this heatwave with over 41 degrees (41.4°C in Brive-la-Gaillarde, Corrèze). In the high mountain regions of the Alps, a record value was also measured (+6.7°C at Capanna Margherita, Piedmont, at 4560m). This time, Italy was more extensively affected, with temperatures repeatedly exceeding 40°C in Emilia, Apulia, Calabria, and record nighttime temperatures (Turin 27.1°C on July 16/17). Slovenia recorded up to 38 degrees during these days. In Hungary, temperatures reached up to 37°C, and the highest heat warning level was in effect in parts of the Balkans, such as Croatia, where 40.0°C was measured in Split-Kaštela, Dalmatia, on July 18, as well as in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro (38.2°C in Podgorica on July 17), Serbia (up to 38°C), and parts of Romania (up to 39°C). During this time, powerful low-pressure troughs dominated the weather in northern Europe, developing into a series of lows (Waldemar–Xaver–Yakari) with slow paths from the British Isles to the Baltic region, steering disturbance fronts over Central Europe. Severe heat thunderstorms occurred from Spain to the Baltic region, more extensively in Germany, Austria, and Poland. A local gust storm near Strasbourg required the evacuation of a scout meeting with 15,000 attendees. A downpour in the Neuchâtel Jura (La Frétaz, 31mm/10min) reached intensities rarely measured in Switzerland. On July 17, Innsbruck Airport recorded storm gusts of 115 km/h, Altenrhein Airport 109 km/h, Poznań in Poland 101 km/h on July 19, and Prievidza in Slovakia 112 km/h on July 20. Four hail fronts in just five hours devastated the Styrian municipalities of Pusterwald and Pölstal on July 19. A new front from July 21 to 23 settled over the Alps and Carpathians, followed by two unusual Atlantic storm lows for this time of year on July 24/25 and July 26/27, named Zeljko and Andreas. These ended the heat with temperature drops of up to 15 degrees within a few hours in northwestern Europe. They again pushed warm air ahead of them. In the Czech Republic, July 22 was the hottest day of the year, with 39.2°C measured in Husinec u Řeže near Prague. In Slovakia, 38.2°C measured in Dudince in central Slovakia was just 0.1°C below the highest temperature ever recorded (Vysoká nad Uhom, 2007). Austria recorded values of 37.9°C in Langenlebarn and Bad Deutsch-Altenburg, similar to early July. Under high-pressure influence south and east of the Pyrenees and Alps, temperatures remained extreme, especially in Andalusia (up to over 38 degrees) and the Hungarian-Serbian-Romanian lowlands (repeatedly 39.0°C in southern Hungary). The southern side of the Swiss Alps remained under the highest heat warning level until July 24. In southeastern Central Europe, cloud cover during this time made the nights particularly warm, with Tata (Komárom-Esztergom) recording a new all-time record for a tropical night on July 25, with a minimum of 25.2°C at dawn (previously 24.0°C in 1988), while daytime temperatures were widely around 35°C. These cold fronts brought severe storms again from southern France to northern Russia and the Carpathian region. In the Blenio Valley in Ticino, a downpour on July 21 with 70mm within an hour again reached an intensity rarely recorded in Switzerland. After thunderstorms, there was a severe mudslide in the Rauris Valley in Salzburg on July 23, followed by flash floods in the Lavant Valley, Carinthia, on July 24. Storm Zeljko was the most intense summer storm ever recorded in the Netherlands on July 25. On July 26 and 27, severe storms occurred in Russia, with up to 50mm of rain falling northwest of Moscow overnight, and the city itself surpassing a 130-year record for that day with 39.9mm (previously 39.1mm in 1883). Golf ball-sized hailstones were reported this time from places like Horb am Neckar (July 22) and the Bryansk Oblast (July 27). A small tornado was sighted near Püspökladány in Hungary on July 26."

                "content": "On July 26, the heat largely retreated to the Mediterranean,[128][129] but at the same time merged with the Central Asian heat, which caused high-pressure system Eva, among others, over Russia.[108][9] Now, in addition to southern Spain[12] and the entire Mediterranean coast from Morocco to Syria, Ukraine[130] also reported temperatures well above 35°C, while in Greece (41°C in Larisa, July 29),[131] western Turkey, Serbia, Romania[132], and Bulgaria[133], measurements again exceeded the 40°C mark, as the heat in Eastern Europe retreated to southern Russia.[125]  \nAt that time, temperatures ranged from about 38°C in the eastern Mediterranean region to nearly 50°C in Mesopotamia and the Arabian Peninsula, with Baghdad recording up to 49°C for several days.[134] In the Maghreb, intense Scirocco winds resumed with 41°C on July 28 in southern Spain and Algiers, and then 42°C on July 30 in Tunis.[135] Around July 31, Central Europe was under the high-pressure influence of high-pressure system Finchen,[136] while a small Mediterranean-Alpine low-pressure system brought some cooling to Spain[12] and severe storms in Tuscany, particularly in Florence.[137] Subsequently, normal summer weather with temperatures around 35°C returned to the Mediterranean region. The high-pressure system stabilized over Eastern Europe. A new, strong, and stationary low-pressure complex over the British Isles to northern Scandinavia, named Bonimir[138][139]-Christian,[140], brought subtropical warm air back to Central Europe with its fronts, this time as a high-pressure ridge primarily eastward around the Alpine region. By August 3, temperatures in the Pannonian Basin, as well as in Poland, eastern Germany, and the Baltic region, rose above 35°C. After a disturbance passed, tropical air flowed west of the Alps from August 6 onward.[141][142] In Vallon-Pont-d’Arc in Ardèche, 40.6°C was recorded on August 6 and 40.9°C the following day.[143]  \nOn August 7, Kitzingen in Franconia matched Germany's record temperature of 40.3°C from early July.[15][16] On the same day, the Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research in Karlsruhe measured a new high of 41.2°C.[39] In Hungary, Poland, and eastern Austria,[144][145], as well as parts of eastern Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and northern Serbia, the highest heat warning level persisted for up to 10 consecutive days, with Hungary experiencing it nationwide throughout.  \nIn the Czech Republic, the Czech Meteorological Institute ČHMÚ recorded 39.3°C in Řež near Prague on August 7[146] and then 39.8°C in Řež and Dobřichovice on August 8,[147] marking the hottest days of the year so far.  \nBerlin-Kaniswall on August 7 and Wrocław in Poland[148] on August 8 both recorded new station records of 38.9°C,[149] as did Minsk in Belarus with 35.8°C (124 years of measurements).[150][149] The smaller upper-level low-pressure core Detlef of the departing low-pressure system Christian, which moved southeastward from the Alps over Italy, ended the heat in southwestern Europe but intensified the warm air inflow over the Eastern Alpine region. A new Eastern European high-pressure system, Gwendolin, stabilized.[151][152] Tarifa in Cádiz, Spain, recorded a new high temperature of 35.4°C[153], while Morón de la Frontera (Seville) experienced a nighttime low of 26.6°C on the night of August 9,[153] and Vienna's city center recorded 26.9°C on the night of August 10,[154] both setting new tropical night records. Topoľčany in Slovakia measured 38.2°C on August 10.[155] The low-pressure system Detlef became a Mediterranean low with an unusually southern trajectory of the Va–Vd characteristic[156] and dissipated over Malta. Severe thunderstorms developed locally ahead of the fronts.  \nMajor landslides occurred on August 5 in San Vito di Cadore near Cortina d’Ampezzo,[157] and in the Gail and Drau valleys in Carinthia.[158]  \nIn Jósvafő in northeastern Hungary, 50 mm of rain fell in 20 minutes, and hail up to 2.5 cm in diameter was reported in Budapest.[159]  \nSevere storms with flooding and mudslides[160] occurred on August 8 in Sarganserland (Weisstannental),[161] Tyrol (Stubaital, Sellraintal),[162] and Salzburg (Mittersill, Kleinarltal, Riedingtal),[163] and on August 10 in Vorarlberg (Gamperdonatal).[164] Severe thunderstorms also occurred on this day in the Stuttgart area, as well as in Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, and North Rhine-Westphalia.[165]  \nThe upper-level trough over Italy caused severe storms with wind and flooding on August 10 and 11 in Italy,[156][166][167] particularly in Campania, as well as in Umbria and Tuscany. A tornado occurred again in Marina di Carrara,[166] a severe hailstorm in Andria,[166] and an enormous 230 mm of rainfall in Rossano Calabro in 5 hours, with 350 mm over the course of the day.[168] Subsequently, the weather pattern shifted: the Azores high extended to Newfoundland, the advancing Atlantic low-pressure system did not move northward beyond Iceland, and unstable low-pressure systems formed over Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region as the high-pressure system moved away, creating a high-pressure bridge over Scandinavia (Hildegard–Isabell) into the Arctic region. A new low-pressure system (Eberhard) formed over the Bay of Biscay and merged with the Icelandic low.[152] These fronts, extending into the Mediterranean region (local low Florian from the Bay of Biscay over the Alps), initially directed warm air with unusual southeastern upper-level flows as far as northern France but then gradually brought more significant cooling to Central Europe. Simultaneously, a northeastern cold air intrusion over northern Russia into Poland brought cooling to Eastern Europe.[169][170] This caused warm air masses to be compressed again in the Pannonian-Carpathian region, with 37.8°C in Budapest-Újpest on August 13 and 26.1°C in Lágymányos, marking the hottest day and warmest night ever recorded in Budapest (previously 37.4°C in 1946 and 25.0°C in 1952, respectively).[171] Similar high temperatures were recorded in adjacent areas of Slovakia[172] and Serbia, while in Moravia, 35 stations (out of a total of 161 nationwide) recorded a day as hot as it had not been in 20 to 50 years, including 36.9°C in Lučina on August 14.[173] Temperatures across Central Europe dropped by up to 20°C within a few days, such as in Montélimar, France, with thunderstorms reducing temperatures from 37°C on August 13 to 20°C on August 14,[174] or in Prague from 35.2°C on August 14 to 14.6°C on August 18.[175]  \nIn Germany, the front caused severe, sometimes stationary storms with wind, hail, and flooding, including a 5–10-year rainfall event in the Stuttgart metropolitan area.[176]  \nIn the western Alps, a Föhn storm with speeds up to 100 km/h began on August 13, and on August 14, the pressure difference between the western and eastern halves of Switzerland was 8 hPa.[177]  \nThe fronts also affected the Adriatic region, with storms in Italy, particularly in Bologna and Rome,[178][179] and in Croatia in Istria and the Kvarner region on August 15.[180]  \nIn the Greater Poland and Lower Silesia regions, intense thunderstorms occurred on August 15.[178]  \nThen, in a relatively narrow band from the northern Balkans to the German North Sea coast, intense rainfall began,[169][181][171] with Budapest recording 80 mm in just one hour and 139 mm in 51 hours on August 17, which is double the average August rainfall,[170] or 90.2 mm on the same day in Hurbanovo, the highest daily total recorded there since measurements began in 1876 and nearly double the monthly average.[181]  \nIn Germany, up to 150 mm of rain fell in a strip from Saxony to North Rhine-Westphalia between August 16 and 19, leading to flooding during heavier thunderstorms due to the parched soils.[176] A small upper-level low over the upper Adriatic[182] continued to cause intense rain in northern Italy and the western Balkans."

                "content": "Over Scandinavia, the stable high-pressure system (Isabell) persisted, with midsummer temperatures reaching Norway, where the summer had previously been largely rainy. Frosta in Nord-Trøndelag (Central Norway) recorded 28.8°C on August 19, temperatures comparable to Rome at that time. Areas such as Pomerania and Western Pomerania were not affected by the cold snap. Then, a southern airflow reestablished itself ahead of the fronts of the powerful Icelandic low-pressure system from previous days, with temperatures exceeding 35°C in Portugal and Spain from August 17, up to 33°C in the Foehn regions of southwestern France, and up to 30°C in southeastern England on August 22. A new Bay of Biscay–North Sea–Scandinavia low-pressure complex (Gerald–Hans–Immanuel) with an associated Mediterranean low brought heavy rainfall to the western and southern Alpine edges, causing floods and landslides in Hérault (Soumont 210 mm/24 h) and on the Côte d’Azur. The situation escalated particularly in Montpellier in southeastern France. In the Alps, Foehn storm fields reached speeds of about 120 km/h at Gütsch or Patscherkofel. Behind these low-pressure systems, a stable bridge developed again from the Azores high to the high-pressure system Isabell, which had since moved to Eastern Europe and was renamed Jessica. This brought another heatwave to Central Europe with a southwestern upper airflow and subtropical air, while a low-pressure trough extended as an air mass boundary from the central North Atlantic over northern Germany to the Black Sea. In southern Italy, temperatures of up to 35°C were recorded from August 24, and in Spain's interior, temperatures reached up to 38°C again from August 25. The heat then extended back to the Baltic region and the Black Sea (High Karma, later Jessica there) and merged once more with the Middle Eastern heat. Temperatures of over 30°C were recorded as far as Latvia, and over 35°C again in several areas of the Balkans, Romania, southern Ukraine, and the Krasnodar–Caucasus region of southern Russia. Only from August 30 did a cooling begin, starting from the Iberian Peninsula, as the disturbance zone controlled by the Scandinavian lows Hans/Immanuel, which had previously been situated in a west-east direction over Central Europe, slowly ended this last heatwave of the meteorological summer. The persistent southwestern airflow shifted the warm air to Eastern Europe. Ahead of the cold front, the hottest September day ever recorded was noted in many places from the Baltic Sea to the Pannonian Plain on September 1, with some locations even setting new all-time highs, such as Görlitz in Saxony with 33.3°C (one degree above the previous record from 1947). With Foehn winds, temperatures in the Austrian Alpine foreland and the Weinviertel exceeded the 35°C mark, with the highest value recorded in Pottschach at the Alpine edge at 36.0°C. In the Czech Republic, Vráž in South Bohemia reported 36.5°C on August 31, and Javorník in Silesia recorded 37.4°C the next day (far exceeding the previous highest September value of 32.2°C on September 6, 2008). Michalovce in the Eastern Slovak Lowland recorded 36.4°C. Dombegyház on the Hungarian-Serbian border also set a national September record with 36.9°C. Temperatures above 35°C and higher warning levels persisted in southeastern Serbia and Macedonia until September 5. The following day, the heatwave reached around Athens for several more days, with temperatures nearing 40°C, ahead of the low-pressure trough advancing southward over the Balkans. A smaller low-pressure complex Jonas/Kalle over the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and then the Baltic region, which had formed from the previous disturbance zone, brought heavy thunderstorms with widespread severe weather, storms, hail, and flooding, particularly along the air mass boundary in the Mediterranean region, for over a week. Temperatures dropped widely by 15°C to 20°C in a short time. On the night of August 31 to September 1, a large storm cell formed over southwestern France, with hurricane-like gusts (152.6 km/h, Le Montat in Lot, the highest wind peak ever recorded there). From northern Europe, only isolated severe local storms were reported, such as in the Aurich district in East Frisia and Saxony. In Emmerich am Rhein, crows were killed by very sudden hail, a rare phenomenon. Severe hailstorms occurred in the Tyrolean Inn Valley on September 3. From September 3 to 4, more than a month's average rainfall fell from a storm cell in southern Spain and the Balearic Islands. These then moved with heavy rain over Provence and northern Italy, with hailstones the size of eggs reported in Naples on September 5. Another larger thunderstorm area (mesoscale convective system) brought torrential rain of up to 100 mm/3 h on September 8 in Calatabiano (Sicily), 90 mm/24 h on Kerkyra (Corfu, Ionian Islands), and then heavier rainfall in Serbia."

                "content": "The highs Lajana and Maybrit, which had formed from the Azores High near Newfoundland and Greenland in the third week of August and mid-September respectively, slowly moved over the British Isles and Scandinavia into northern Russia during mid and late September, only associated with autumnal warmth. From there, a high-pressure bridge formed between the Mediterranean lows into the North African region, which, starting September 9, again led to temporarily summer-like temperatures from Switzerland to Eastern Europe with strong föhn-like southwesterly flows. From September 14, temperatures gradually rose above 30 degrees in the Alpine foothills, eastern Austria, the Carpathian Basin, and then the Eastern European Plain. The Alpine föhn reached hurricane strength on September 16, with 172 km/h at Gütsch (September 17), 135 km/h at Weissbad AI (Ebenalp) (September 16), 156 km/h at Patscherkofel (Tyrol) (September 16), 119 km/h in the valleys at Brülisau AI (September 16), 136 km/h in Innsbruck-Olympic Village (September 16), and still up to 100 km/h in Vienna (September 18), causing widespread storm damage. In Austria, Gumpoldskirchen recorded a new record of 35.5°C on September 17 for the second half of September, with temperatures above 30 degrees this late in the year being recorded only a few times in the entire measurement history (in Vienna in 1947, 2003, 1961, and 1867). In the central Balkans and later along the lower Danube, the heat reached well over 35 degrees. Szeged measured 36.4°C on September 17, and Körösszakálon recorded 37.2°C on September 18, each setting new national September records. In the southern and eastern Carpathians, temperatures were up to 10°C above the normal weekly average for these days, with some locations recording the highest values of the year. Along the Italian lower Adriatic (Abruzzo, Molise, and Puglia) on September 17, temperatures even exceeded 40 degrees, also marking the highest September temperatures ever recorded there. The warmth also reached the Baltic region and Scandinavia. The heat persisted in the Carpathian Basin until September 19 and then retreated with High Lajana into the Aegean–Black Sea region. Around September 25, it reached the Moscow area and the White Sea region with High Maybrit and large-scale southern flows, persisting until early October in the Russian Black Sea region and Volga area. Ahead of the advancing fronts of an Atlantic low-pressure complex – Leo, Michael, and ex-Henri, a tropical storm from the mid-Atlantic – there were massive rains in the southern slopes of southern France (Épisode méditerranéen) from September 11–13, with 256 mm/24 h in Valleraugue (Gard), 242 mm/6 h in Grospierres (Ardèche), and over 110 km/h winds in Nice. The following front, which pushed the heat out of Southeast Europe, brought storms on September 16 from Portugal across northern Spain, central France (135 km/h in Saint-Dizier, Champagne-Ardenne, and Clamecy, Burgundy), southeastern England, western Germany, to southern Sweden. Another Adriatic low (Patrik) caused heavy rainfall and tornadoes in the Aegean region on September 21/22. This was followed by another stable European high, Netti, which in Central Europe was only associated with autumnal temperatures but again brought temperatures above 30 degrees in Portugal and southern Spain."

                "content": "A particular feature of this heatwave is the preceding series of large and poorly predictable temperature fluctuations in Europe during the spring.  \nAs early as the beginning of May, a heatwave in Spain reached temperatures of nearly 45 degrees (44.4°C in Carcaixent, southern Valencia) and claimed lives, while temperatures in Central Europe reached 30 degrees. This heatwave ended with severe storms.  \nSubsequently, the Alpine region experienced persistent rain, sub-zero temperatures, and snowfall down to low altitudes due to a strong cold spell. In some areas, this month was the cloudiest May in the last 25 years.  \nJune initially brought another heat period with up to 35 degrees in Central Europe and again severe thunderstorms. The subsequent \"sheep cold\" in the second half of June – surprisingly according to medium-term forecasts – led to a polar cold air intrusion with temperatures significantly below 10 degrees (e.g., 0.3°C in Obertauern, 1772 m, on June 24).  \nIt was the globally warmest May and June recorded since the beginning of worldwide consistent and reliable weather records in the 1880s. At the same time, abnormal heat prevailed at the eastern edge of the European heatwave, in the region from Central Siberia to the Caspian Sea (47.2°C in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, June 30) to Pakistan (49°C in June) and then in Siberia and northern China (up to 40°C in mid-July) and to the Middle East (52.5°C in Mitribah, Kuwait, July 17; Mahshahr, Iran, 46°C, August 1) and in Northeast Africa (46°C in southern Egypt in mid-August), with severe wildfires in Siberia around Lake Baikal.  \nHeatwaves also occurred simultaneously in North America (northwest; repeatedly 45°C, June 28), where one of the most intense wildfire years in recent history occurred after years of drought, in Mexico (up to 40 degrees at the end of August), and in Japan (38.5°C in Jōetsu Takada, July 13).  \nColombia (42.2°C, Urumitia, July 1) and Thailand (41.1°C, Kamalasai, July 1) also reported their hottest July days since records began. In Africa, July was the second hottest (after 2002), and in South America, the fifth hottest in recorded history.  \nIn contrast, unusual cold was recorded in New Zealand and Australia during their southern winter in mid-July (snowfall in the Blue Mountains not seen in 20 years).  \nOverall, both July and August – like the two preceding months – were the hottest ever recorded globally, with August particularly in Europe, Africa, and South America.  \nFrom May onward, there was an extensive blocking situation across the entire Northern Hemisphere, which was particularly pronounced over the Pacific and led to an abnormal jet stream pattern, disrupted westerly drift, and stationary high-pressure systems, causing heatwaves on four continents.  \nThe North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillation indices fell sharply contrary to forecasts, indicating polar cold air flowing toward Europe due to a weak Azores High; however, this air did not reach the continent due to the blocking but remained over the mid-Atlantic.  \nThe last such regularly occurring hemispheric blocking situation had led to a major cold wave in North America, winter heat in Siberia, as well as storm surges and floods in Europe during the winter of 2014.  \nFrom the second decade of July, a powerful polar high dominated Europe's weather. As a result, the tropical Hadley cell expanded into mid-latitudes. Simultaneously, the West African monsoon system (Guinea monsoon) intensified, steering tropical air masses over the Sahara into the Mediterranean region. Consequently, the heat center shifted from the western to the central and then eastern Mediterranean.  \nAt the beginning of August, a strongly blocked omega pattern developed again between Atlantic lows and a cold-air-drop-like low over Siberia, with warm air advancing over the White Sea to the North Pole; for example, 850-hPa temperatures there on August 7 were above 0°C, comparable to Ireland or the West Siberian Plain east of the Urals.  \nThe Azores High, on the other hand, had shifted to the western Atlantic at about 35° north latitude, corresponding to the latitude of North Carolina–Gibraltar. The jet stream was consequently displaced to northern latitudes of 40–60°, reaching the latitude of Newfoundland–Biscay–northern Scandinavia.  \nOn August 6, an abnormally strong Sahara dust outburst toward South America was observed.  \nThe final phase was characterized by blocked North Atlantic highs, with the jet stream remaining extremely far north.  \nThe overall weather pattern is seen as a symptom of the ongoing El Niño event, active since April, which intensified into the fall and only transitioned into a La Niña event in May 2015.  \nThe intensity of the heat event is considered to be linked to global warming, according to current research.  \nDue to the El Niño influence and the Azores High characteristics, the Atlantic hurricane season was largely absent, being one of the weakest in many years. In contrast, Pacific typhoons were above average in frequency.  \nThe course of the heatwave could be well predicted in July with the European IFS model of ECMWF (10–14 days in advance), while the American NOAA-NCEP CFS/GFS model showed poor results.  \nThe medium-term climatology lies outside expectations even in the ensemble, and long-term forecasts from the spring – for example, regarding hurricanes – were repeatedly revised.  \nIn addition to numerous local daily values across Europe, which were the highest since the beginning of respective records, it was already foreseeable by mid-July that July 2015 would be the hottest July ever recorded in Spain, Austria, Switzerland, and northern Italy, and one of the hottest months overall, including August months.  \nAugust 2015 was the hottest August in eastern Germany, such as in Berlin and Dresden, in 208 years, with 13 to 14 (locally up to 17 in southeastern Brandenburg) hot days, surpassing the old hot day records of August 1944.  \nAugust 2015 thus strongly resembled July 2006, which brought up to 21 hot days in Lusatia.  \nThe overall high summer (July and August 2015) was in Berlin – albeit narrowly – the warmest since 1834, surpassing the high summer of 1994.  \nHowever, the three-month interval June–August (meteorological summer) was only the third highest measured in Europe since 2012, after 2003 and 2010.  \nThe low precipitation levels are also abnormal. This can be described as a century event on a large scale."

                "header": "Effects",
                "content": "Heat-related excess mortality was recorded in several countries across Europe. Spain and Switzerland were the most affected, but Italy, France, Belgium, and Greece were also impacted. Direct heat casualties were only sporadically reported, but numerous fatal swimming accidents occurred, particularly in East-Central Europe and the Baltic region. Special emergency plans for health issues caused by prolonged heat were activated in Spain, the Netherlands, and France, among others. The storms and severe weather accompanying the heatwave caused damages amounting to billions of euros (e.g., €150 million on July 8 in Carinthia, one of the region's most severe thunderstorm/hail damage events ever). These events claimed lives in Italy (July 8, August 5, August 10), Hungary (July 8), Austria (July 9, July 21), Poland (July 19), the Netherlands (July 26), the Czech Republic (July 26), and France (August 23, September 16). The heatwave also exacerbated humanitarian issues related to the refugee crisis at the time. It affected North Africa and the crisis region in the Middle East, where droughts and the Syria/ISIS conflict forced millions to flee, with life-threatening conditions due to temperatures exceeding 50°C. Similarly affected were the southern and east-central European countries, which are typical first-asylum states. Their reception centers were completely overcrowded: since spring, over 200,000 refugees arrived in Greece, and around 100,000 in Italy via the Mediterranean. Starting in July, there was uncontrolled migration to Central Europe, particularly along the Balkan route through Greece—aggravated by the economic crisis there—which escalated, with daily transit numbers rising from several hundred in early summer to several thousand by early autumn. Border controls had to be reinstated at numerous borders, even within the EU, sometimes with military support. Hungary erected a border fence with Serbia over the summer. Macedonia declared a state of emergency in late August. Even in Austria and Germany, the main destination for most of these refugees, chaotic conditions prevailed. Across the Mediterranean region and even in temperate Europe, drought increasingly became a problem, especially in areas where annual rainfall was already far below average due to spring heatwaves, such as in Portugal, Spain, almost all of France, central Germany, northern Italy, eastern Austria, Ukraine, and Belarus, as well as in Ireland, which was not affected by the heat. Crop failures across Europe also reached billions of euros. For example, the Austrian Hail Insurance estimated the total agricultural damage from heat at €170 million, with an additional €40 million from storms. An exception was viticulture, where the heat led to widespread expectations of a fully ripe harvest and a significant vintage of reserve wines. However, there were also severe hail losses, particularly affecting Chablis in Burgundy shortly before the harvest. The drought also caused river levels to drop, with the Elbe experiencing a 50-year low, and navigation on the Rhine and Danube increasingly hindered, though less so due to intermittent storms in their catchment areas. The Po River experienced extreme low water levels in July. A unique aspect of the weather event was the overheating of the Mediterranean Sea. By mid-July, surface water temperatures in the Tyrrhenian Sea off southern Italy were already widely at 30°C, and over 28°C in a third of the entire sea area from Gibraltar to the Levant, with peak values in some bays reaching 34°C. (In 2003, temperatures of 32°C were measured off the Balearic Islands in August.) At the end of July, fish die-offs occurred in the Tyrrhenian Sea off Tuscany. Switzerland also experienced dramatic fish die-offs. However, feared severe storms in autumn due to stored energy largely did not materialize. Overheating also became a problem in continental waters, with Lake Constance reaching over 26°C, the highest temperature ever recorded. Widespread forest fires occurred in Europe, including one near the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in early July. Ukrainian and Russian authorities reported no increased radioactivity. In southwestern Germany, there were several forest and grass fires in the first half of July. The situation in the Mediterranean region remained under control by late July, such as in Greece, which had not been abnormally affected by the heat, with numerous bushfires, including one near Athens, as well as in Italy and the eastern Adriatic region in Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia. More severe fires occurred in Portugal and Spain in mid-August. However, widespread forest damage feared due to the general heat and drought did not materialize. Windthrow from Storm Niklas in late March and others during the summer remained the main cause of localized high forest damage, while bark beetle infestations remained at a low level (e.g., in 2003, severe beetle damage occurred after Winter Storm Uschi and summer heat). In Germany, heat damage to road surfaces in early July caused full closures and speed limits on various highways. In Essen, some urban rail vehicles became stuck in softened bitumen. In the Upper Palatinate, severe track distortions and prolonged closures occurred on the Cham–Waldmünchen and Cham–Bad Kötzting railway lines in mid-July. In Austria, track breaks occurred on the Arlberg and Außerfern railways in Tyrol in early July, which were quickly repaired. According to the French grid operator RTE, numerous power outages occurred at the start of the first heatwave due to grid overloads from cooling systems. On June 30, nearly one million French households were without power. Later, there were several extensive power outages across Europe due to storms."

In mid-June, when warm high pressure covered the region, extreme heat days were recorded one after another in western Japan. In early July, when the Pacific high pressure system intensified, temperatures from northern to western Japan were higher than average. Particularly from August 9 to 12, the country experienced four days of the most intense heat, with over 290 locations recording extreme heat days, an unprecedented event even compared to 2018. Additionally, record-breaking heat was notable in Pacific coastal prefectures such as Miyazaki, Kochi, Wakayama, and Chiba. On the other hand, due to the limited impact of the Foehn phenomenon on the Sea of Japan side, there were many cases where the maximum temperatures were below average, such as in Niigata Prefecture and the two San'in prefectures, where maximum temperatures did not exceed 37 degrees Celsius."

                "content": "In Katsunuma, Koshu City, Yamanashi Prefecture, the daily maximum temperature exceeded 39°C for four consecutive days, recording 39.1°C on the 9th, 39.2°C on the 10th, 39.3°C on the 11th, and 39.1°C on the 12th. In Tatebayashi City, Gunma Prefecture, a daily maximum temperature of 39.5°C was observed on the 11th. Additionally, from around July 22 to 25 and from July 31 to August 3, high temperatures were recorded in Saga Prefecture, Miyazaki Prefecture, Kochi Prefecture, and other areas. From late August to mid-August, temperatures from northern Japan to western Japan were significantly higher than average, with 39.3°C observed in Ekawasaki, Shimanto City, Kochi Prefecture, on the 9th. Regarding the series of record-breaking high temperatures observed in Ekawasaki, Shimanto City, Kochi Prefecture, and other locations, it has been suggested that the \"two-story structure\" of high pressure, where the Tibetan high pressure extends over the Pacific high pressure, strengthens the downward airflow within the high-pressure system, compressing and heating the air near the surface, thereby raising temperatures. Additionally, the Foehn phenomenon, where dry, hot winds blow over mountains, has also been cited as a contributing factor. From around the 18th to the 23rd, extreme heat returned to Kyushu. On the 20th, a daily maximum temperature of 39.6°C, tying the record for the highest in Kyushu's history, was observed in Ushibuka, Amakusa City, Kumamoto Prefecture. On the 22nd, extreme heat of 38–39°C was recorded in various parts of the Tokai region. Although the heat gradually subsided thereafter, on October 9, a temperature of 35.1°C, the latest-ever recorded midsummer day in October nationwide, was observed in Itoigawa City, Niigata Prefecture. The monthly temperature deviations from the average were +0.9°C in eastern Japan, +0.7°C in western Japan, and +0.9°C in the Nansei Islands in June; +1.3°C in northern Japan, +1.6°C in western Japan, and +0.3°C in the Nansei Islands in July; and +1.3°C in eastern and western Japan and +0.8°C in the Nansei Islands in August. Notably, the deviations of +2.8°C in western Japan in mid-June, +3.4°C in northern Japan in early July, +1.4°C in the Nansei Islands in early August, and +2.7°C in northern Japan, +2.4°C in eastern Japan, and +2.3°C in western Japan in mid-August were all record highs for those respective periods. Furthermore, in western Japan, the average summer temperature was +1.2°C, the highest since statistics began in 1946. This summer, 125 locations (143 including tied records) out of 927 AMeDAS observation points nationwide set new records for daily maximum temperatures."

This resulted in continued clear weather and high temperatures. It is believed that the downward flow of air within the high-pressure system was intensified, compressing and heating near the surface, thereby raising temperatures.  \nAdditionally, the Kochi Local Meteorological Observatory attributes the extreme heat exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in Ekawasaki, Shimanto City, to the above factors combined with the Foehn phenomenon, where dry, hot winds blow over the mountains."

The Ministry of Education issued a warning to schools to take necessary precautions against heatstroke following the death of a six-year-old child who was exposed to the sun outdoors. It is worth noting that less than half of the schools in the country are equipped with air conditioning, and government officials have previously discussed extending school holidays for the safety of children. Additionally, the government covers the cost of installing air conditioners in schools. Kyushu Electric Power Company had also offered a 10% discount on the bills of customers aged 75 and older between August and September to encourage the use of air conditioning."

This was evident, for example, through a persistent drought and heat in Europe, wildfires in California, and other weather events in the Northern Hemisphere. The heatwave in Australia thus continued a series of global heatwaves, following unusual weather events already recorded in Australia in 2016. Since January temperatures in Australia are typically higher than December temperatures, it was feared as early as December 2018 that the heatwave in Australia could persist or even intensify. Many Australians associate the heatwave with global warming. January 2019 was the warmest January in Australia since the beginning of weather records; for the first time, a nationwide average temperature of 30 degrees Celsius was exceeded. The previous January record was surpassed by 2 to 3 degrees in some cases. With 36.6 degrees Celsius on January 26 in Wanaaring (North Western, New South Wales), the nighttime heat record for the Southern Hemisphere was broken."

Subsequent bushfires and droughts were feared. High ozone levels were also reported. A nationwide fire ban was issued. The heatwave also affected large parts of Australia in January. At the end of January, the city of Adelaide broke its heat record from 1939 with 46.2 degrees. On January 25, the highest temperature ever recorded in a coastal location was measured in Port Augusta at 49.5 degrees. The heatwave was followed by a monsoon with partly extreme rainfall. In some areas, over 1000 mm of rain fell per square meter; northern Queensland was particularly affected. The city of Townsville had to be deliberately flooded to prevent a dam breach; 2000 houses were underwater."

The weather anomaly contributed to a debate about the climate crisis. In particular, in Australia itself, which has a comparatively high per capita greenhouse gas emission, the heatwave triggered extensive discussions in politics. Coal is Australia's second most important export product, and accordingly, the Australian coal industry, which has a strong lobby in politics, received backing from the governments of previous years, while climate change and renewable energies played no significant role in the political debate. In the settlement of Santa Teresa, about 80 kilometers southwest of Alice Springs, around 40 dead brumbies were found in dried-up waterholes. Rangers shot 55 more feral horses suffering from water shortages. In Western Australia, more than 2,500 wild camels were shot. They had broken through fences around private grazing land to access water. Uluru (Ayers Rock) was closed due to the extreme heat, yet a German tourist died of water shortage on New Year's Day.

Nasir formed around June 18 near Newfoundland and remained near Spain and England until almost the end of the month before moving eastward over Scandinavia. With a powerful southwesterly upper-level flow, an air mass from the Azores High – initially called Ulla, later referred to as the high-pressure bridge Vera from June 25 – moved into the North Sea region and then southeastward over Central Europe. As a result, hot Saharan air advanced over the Iberian Peninsula and southern France from June 23, reaching the Baltic Sea region by the end of the month. With a low-pressure system, Otto, in the Baltic region, a short-term omega block formed over the flat pressure distribution of several lows in the Mediterranean region. Temperatures reached a peak of 46.0°C on June 28 in Vérargues, Hérault, southern France (and 45.9°C in nearby Gallargues-le-Montueux, Gard), the highest temperature ever recorded in mainland France (previously 44.1°C in Conqueyrac, August 2003). This record was surpassed in 2019 at several measurement sites in the region. France became the seventh European country to record temperatures above 45°C. Andorra also recorded a new national record of 39.4°C in Borda Vidal on the 28th (previously 38.5°C in Andorra La Vella, July 2005). Numerous all-time records were set, including in Spain, France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Croatia. Nighttime minimum temperatures also reached new all-time records at several stations. Another notable feature was the abnormally high temperatures in elevated areas, such as the Pyrenees – where the peak temperatures in southern France were also influenced by Foehn effects – and the Alps. For example, Davos (Graubünden, 1596 m) recorded a new high of 29.8°C on the 26th (previously 29.3°C in 2015), as did the Schmittenhöhe (Salzburg, 1956 m) on the 27th with 25.0°C (previously 24.6°C in 1952). St. Martin in Passeier (South Tyrol, 586 m) reported 39.9°C on the same day. At the beginning of July, the hot air was pushed back into the Mediterranean region, with a few more hot days in the Balkans. In the Eastern Alps, for example, the midsummer weather persisted until July 7. The heatwave ended with some severe thunderstorms, such as in France and Austria, and around July 10 with the advance of cold air into Spain, the upper Adriatic, the eastern edge of the Alps, and Greece. By mid-July, more unstable weather patterns prevailed (storms in Corsica and the Southern Alps). There were widespread wildfires, favored by drought and heat."

With a renewed southwesterly flow, heat returned to Spain around July 18, and a more stable high-pressure system (Yvonne) formed over Central Europe. By July 23, with the arrival of a strong Atlantic low-pressure system, a brief omega-like weather pattern developed. In Spain and France, temperatures of over 40°C were widely recorded as early as July 23. The following days became even hotter.\n\nSeveral national weather services recorded unprecedented peak air temperatures:\nIn Germany, the stations in Duisburg-Baerl and Tönisvorst reported 41.2°C on July 25; the day before, 40.5°C had been measured in Geilenkirchen near Aachen (previously 40.3°C in Kitzingen, 2015; see also heat records in Germany) – this old record was surpassed in several locations.\nIn Belgium, 41.8°C was recorded in Begijnendijk on the same day; the day before, 39.9°C was measured in Kleine-Brogel (previously 38.8°C in Liège-Monsin, July 2015).\nIn the Netherlands, 40.7°C was recorded in Gilze en Rijen at the same time; the day before, 39.3°C was measured in Eindhoven (previously 38.6°C in Warnsveld, August 1944) – a 75-year-old record that was broken.\nIn Luxembourg, 39.0°C was also recorded on that day at the Findel-Aéroport station (previously 37.9°C there in August 2003).\nOn July 25, a national record of 38.7°C was measured in the United Kingdom at the Botanical Garden of the University of Cambridge (previously 38.5°C in Faversham, August 2003).\nNumerous individual locations also registered their new all-time records, including Paris, which recorded 42.6°C on July 25, marking the highest value in Europe during this heatwave (Montsouris station, previously 1947). With the strong Atlantic low-pressure system moving northward toward Iceland, the heatwave in Central Europe ended as early as July 26, accompanied by stormy weather and a significant temperature drop of up to 15°C. The subtropical warm air mass was split (low-pressure front Vincent), separated in the Baltic Sea region, and displaced by south winds over northern Scandinavia. There, the air mass merged with the current polar high and was carried westward by the Icelandic low-pressure complex, reaching East Greenland. In the Greenland Sea–Norwegian Sea area, it remained abnormally warm until the early days of August. On July 27, Norway recorded 35.6°C in Laksfors, at over 65°N, equaling the country's nearly 40-year-old all-time record (Nesbyen, June 1970; significantly further south at 60°), and also experienced tropical nights.\n\nIn central Sweden, southern Finland, and all of Estonia, temperatures above 30°C were widely recorded, with Helsinki setting a new record of 33.2°C (previously 31.6°C in July 1945). In Greenland, 20.6°C was measured on July 31 in Qaarsut, located on the west coast by Baffin Bay (71°N) – a normal summer temperature there is around 10°C. The Nord station, only 900 km south of the North Pole, recorded 16.0°C. In Central Europe, the weather was dominated by Atlantic cold fronts and a Mediterranean low-pressure system as an offshoot. From July 26, this led to severe storms, particularly in Morocco, Catalonia, central Italy, all of Austria, the western Balkans, as well as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. The heat retreated fairly quickly from the Mediterranean region.\n\nThe British Isles experienced heavy rainfall around the turn of the month due to the Atlantic low-pressure system."

Around August 7, another strong Atlantic low-pressure system (Yap) formed, causing another surge of Saharan air into southern Europe (high-pressure zone Andrea). The center of this heatwave shifted from southern Spain to the region of the Italian Peninsula, the Balkans, and the Aegean. Thessaly recorded temperatures of 40°C from August 8, 2019, Leskovac in Serbia reached 38.1°C on August 12, and Belgrade experienced five consecutive tropical nights. During this time, similar peak temperatures were also measured in Ukraine. The heat slowly retreated to the southeast, with temperatures still exceeding 40°C in Turkey. Wildfires broke out again in the Mediterranean region. In the stormy zone at the edge of the Atlantic low-pressure system, a tornado formed on August 9, causing severe damage in Luxembourg. The front remained storm-prone over Central Europe for several days, with localized heavy rainfall. Southern and Eastern Europe remained under the influence of the Azores high-pressure offshoots (Beatrix), with a strong low-pressure system (Bernd) over England. Temperatures in southern Spain reached over 40°C for another week, and widespread temperatures exceeded 35°C up to the Black Sea. The front from Bernd, with a small Mediterranean low-pressure system as an offshoot, led to severe storms from August 19 to 22, with partly hurricane-like gusts, from eastern Switzerland through parts of southern and central Germany to the Polish-Slovak Tatra Mountains."

                "content": "Such intense heat so early in the year was a rarity across Europe; some countries and numerous weather stations recorded new daily maximum temperature records for June. In Poland, an 80-year-old record for peak temperature was broken (1935), in Germany a 70-year-old record (1947). In France, almost a quarter (23%) of all Meteo-France stations recorded new all-time records, and almost two-thirds (60%) recorded a June record. The beginning of June was already exceptionally hot; throughout June, there was a prevailing foehn-like south to southwest airflow. June 2019 became the warmest month ever recorded in all of Europe since the beginning of weather records (1 degree warmer than the previous record June of 1999), including in Austria (weather series since 1767), in Poland (previously June 1811), in Germany (weather series since 1881), in the Czech Republic (since 1961), and in Latvia (since 1924); it was the second warmest in Switzerland (after 2003). The minimal nighttime cooling was also remarkable; Vienna (Inner City), for example, experienced thirteen tropical nights not dropping below 20°C during the month (also a new local record for June). July was also abnormally warm but only locally a record month.\n\nA peculiarity of this heatwave was the drift of warm air to the northwest, leading to an intense ice melt event in Greenland. There, even at 3200 m (Station Summit Camp), the zero-degree threshold was exceeded for several days, which had only previously occurred in 2012. (See also Consequences of Global Warming in the Arctic#Mass Loss Greenland) The period of the last days of June was regionally 10–6 degrees above the long-term average, mainly in France, northern Spain, northern Italy, Switzerland, western Austria, southern Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nAs a heatwave lasting up to 7 days – slightly longer in some places – the event ranks among the 5 to 10 most intense in the longer measurement history in some regions. The second heatwave was comparable and, particularly in France, more intense than the first event, contrary to the national record set in June. The cause of the heatwaves was an excessively oscillating jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere, which then transitioned into chaotic phases. This shift of the polar front led to strong heat exchanges from the tropics to the polar regions.\n\nThe northwest and northeast of North America also recorded their hottest July, and extreme heatwaves occurred simultaneously in the USA, the Near and Middle East, and East Asia. In the Arctic belt, numerous wildfires broke out due to the abnormal dryness. The extent of polar ice melt was in the range of record years 2012, 2002, 2007, and 2016 (see Consequences of Global Warming in the Arctic and Consequences of Global Warming in the Antarctic). Globally, June was also the warmest ever recorded, 0.1° above the last record month, June 2016. July 2019 matched the previous record of July 2016 (analysis beginning in the 1980s).\n\nAs in 2016, 2019 experienced an El Niño event (but not for the long European heat anomalies of summer 2017 and 2018, which each followed a La Niña event). As with every heatwave in recent years, this one is also attributed to global warming according to current research, an assumption not directly provable for individual events but a correlation (statistical probabilities). According to a 2020 study by the Institute of Physics, the results of climatological attribution research show that the short and simultaneously intense events occurring during the heatwave would have been very unlikely without human-induced climate changes. Not only the temperatures but also the precipitation levels were unusual this summer, either extremely high or low: Summer 2019 was overall rated as \"extremely dry.\" Over the entire calendar year, 2019 was the warmest year in Europe since records began."

In a band from Spain through northern Italy to the Baltic region and another band from northeastern France to Sweden, there was hardly any rain in June, and in July, these areas also experienced abnormally low precipitation. There were numerous large wildfires, for example, in June in Spain (around Almorox in the Madrid metropolitan area, near Toledo, in Catalonia), in southern France (Gard department); in July in Germany (near Lübtheen in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania); in Portugal (Vila de Rei); again in southern France (Argelès-sur-Mer and Trèbes), Italy (on Sardinia), in Croatia (Pag Island); in August in Greece (e.g., on Elafonissos, near Marathon) and Cyprus. On Gran Canaria, off the west coast of Africa, there were also wildfires due to the heatwave; on August 19, 3,400 hectares and on August 20, 6,000 hectares were affected. In some areas outside the Mediterranean region – where drought, especially in Spain, has already become a long-term problem – there was also water scarcity, including in northern and central Germany. The situation was particularly precarious for agriculture in parts of Poland and the Baltic region, where prolonged drought threatened significant crop failures. At the beginning of July, Lithuania declared a national emergency. Severe weather also caused significant damage. Another consequence of the heatwaves is extensive forest damage, the causes of which lie in the droughts of previous years, such as mass infestations of bark beetles and other forest damage patterns. In Germany, the discussion about forest dieback became relevant again."

Towards the end of the July heatwave, heavy rain in England threatened to break a reservoir, the Toddbrook Reservoir near Manchester.

At the peak of the episode, more than three-quarters of France were under a heatwave alert. Fifty-four French departments were placed at the orange level, from Midi-Pyrénées to the northeast. More impressively, the 15 departments of Haute-Normandie, Hauts-de-France, and Île-de-France were placed on RED alert from Friday, August 7, to Tuesday, August 11. This heatwave was an exceptionally significant climatic event that occurred in August 2020. These episodes of intense heat are the most widespread since records began. Numerous temperature records were broken. An initial heat peak occurred on July 30 and 31, with the heat arriving from the southwest and then moving toward the western and eastern regions. On July 30, temperatures of 41.9°C were recorded in Socoa (a new absolute heat record), 40.6°C in Cazaux (monthly record), and 38.3°C in Royan (monthly record). The next day, temperatures reached 41.3°C in Vichy, 39.4°C in Nevers, and 37.9°C in Boulogne-sur-Mer. The heat then shifted toward the southeast, and temperatures eventually returned to more bearable levels. However, this respite was only temporary as a new, longer heatwave arrived on August 6. Numerous monthly and even absolute heat records were set on August 7 in western France, with 41.9°C in Bellis in the Landes (absolute record), 39.8°C in Cognac, 39.6°C in Nantes, and 33.4°C in Cherbourg (monthly records). Temperatures then dropped in the west, but the heat intensified in the north and east of the country. August 8 and 9 were the hottest days in northern and eastern France. On August 8, the mercury reached 37.1°C in Lille (monthly record). Also noteworthy on the same day were minimum temperatures of 25.2°C in Boulogne-sur-Mer and 22.2°C in Alençon (absolute records). The next day, temperatures reached 39.3°C in Creil and 38.4°C in Rouen (monthly records). The temperature did not drop below 23°C in Lille (monthly record) or 21.4°C in Beauvais (absolute record). On August 10, the heatwave lost some intensity but remained quite strong. It was not until August 13 that the heatwave subsided, with the arrival of numerous storms. On a national scale, this episode was shorter and less intense than that of 2003, but in some departments, it was of an intensity close to or even locally exceeding that of 2003 (for example, in Lille, where the average temperature over seven days exceeded by 1°C the highest average temperature recorded over seven days in 2003). The first half of this August was the second hottest ever recorded (though far behind 2003), and this August was the third hottest ever recorded, with a 2°C surplus compared to the 1981–2010 average, behind 2003 (+4.2°C) and 1997 (+2.1°C). It would later be surpassed by August 2022. The heatwave is estimated to have caused 1,900 deaths."

At the cold pole of the (inhabited) Earth (Verkhoyansk), temperatures of up to 38 degrees Celsius were measured. This value was reached on June 20, 2020, and recognized by the WMO in 2021. The record temperature was caused by warm air masses from the southern continental temperate climate zone in the region and a large high-pressure area. Even the winter of 2019/20 and the spring of 2020 were exceptionally mild/warm.\n\nAccording to Anders Levermann from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, temperatures in Siberia from January to May 2020 were about 7 degrees Celsius higher than usual. This is a completely new and so far unexplained phenomenon; the jet stream cannot explain it (quote: it \"lasts only one to two weeks, not five months\"). The heatwave is associated with global warming in the Arctic (see also the consequences of global warming in the Arctic). A group of European scientists from the World Weather Attribution published the results of an investigation of various climate models on the current climate events in Siberia on July 15, 2020. They attribute the heatwave to human influences. The warming of Siberia is such an extreme climate event that even considering climate change, it would only occur every 130 years; without climate change, such an extreme weather event would occur only about every 80,000 years. Humans increase the likelihood of such heatwaves by 600 times through greenhouse gas emissions. As a result of the extreme heat, thawing of the permafrost is being observed. The diesel oil disaster near Norilsk is to be considered a consequence of the heatwave. In 2020, as in 2019 and 2021, there were exceptionally many and large wildfires in Siberia."

It is notable that the number of deaths was more than double that of the second deadliest heatwave, an extremely strong one that struck central Greece in August 1958 and killed 600 people, mainly in Thessaly. The maximum temperature recorded at the National Observatory of Athens, in the center of Athens, was 41.9°C on July 23, and in Nea Filadelfeia, it was 43.6°C on July 27, which was the highest recorded in the Athens area. These temperatures were combined with high minimums, the highest being 30.2°C in central Athens on July 27 and 29.9°C on July 24 in Nea Filadelfeia. The lowest minimum was 25.6°C in central Athens. Additionally, humidity was high (60% in Athens on July 23), and wind speeds were low, contributing to discomfort even during the night. The first deaths—nine in total—were recorded in Athens on July 22, and the number began to rise rapidly each day. On July 23, 12 people died, on July 24 another 95, and on July 25 another 250, causing burial issues. By July 26, the total number of victims had reached 900, with 180 more added on July 27 and another 200 on July 28. It is estimated that 400 elderly people died helplessly. Although the heatwave also affected other cities, such as Thessaloniki and Larissa, it is considered that the discomfort was more intense in Athens due to the presence of photochemical smog, which had worsened due to temperature inversions caused by a high-pressure system that simultaneously moved in from the Sahara."

In this initial stage, the unusual heat did not affect the Canary Islands, Galicia, the western Cantabrian coast, and parts of the Mediterranean coast of the peninsula. Initially, Aemet forecasted that the heatwave would last until Wednesday, June 15, without ruling out the possibility of it continuing for the rest of the week. On June 11, high temperatures were already recorded in the southwest of the peninsula, with 41°C in Seville. Alerts remained active for Aragón, Castilla y León, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, and Madrid at the yellow level, and orange for Extremadura and Andalusia. However, the meteorological conditions did not meet the official criteria to declare the start of the heatwave. On June 12, thermometers recorded 43.2°C in Almadén (Ciudad Real), the highest value on the official start day of the heatwave. Temperatures above 40°C were also recorded at 47 Aemet network stations. Additionally, the agency issued special notice number 3/2022 with information about the phenomenon, its forecast, and announced the start of the national plan for preventive actions against the effects of excessive temperatures on health, including a level assignment map. In the province of Almería, a 62-year-old man died after collapsing and showing symptoms of dehydration while hiking on the Antenas trail near the Totem of Aguadulce. On June 13, Aemet announced in its official report a possible end date for the heatwave on Thursday, June 16, while noting that \"due to the behavior of a DANA (isolated depression at high levels) located in Madeira, whose evolution cannot be precisely determined.\" On June 14, the heatwave extended to southern Galicia and the interior of the Cantabrian region. Tropical nights also continued, with thermometers not dropping below 20°C in many provinces, particularly in Jaén, where a minimum of 27°C was expected. Furthermore, it was forecasted that the peak of the heatwave would be reached on Friday, June 17, breaking some temperature records in cities like Zaragoza, Lleida, and Córdoba. The only areas in Spain that had so far escaped the heatwave were Asturias, the Canary Islands, and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. In its daily report, Aemet forecasted the end of the meteorological episode for Saturday, as the DANA in the Atlantic, which injects hot African air, approached the peninsula, causing instability and a drop in temperatures. In Vega de Valcarce, a 69-year-old German pilgrim possibly died from heatstroke while walking the Villafranca del Bierzo stage of the Camino de Santiago. Rubén del Campo, Aemet spokesperson, stated that it was the \"most intense heatwave for mid-June in at least the last 20 years.\" On June 15, the \"Iberian exception\" was applied for the first time, whereby the regulated price of electricity is calculated with a cap on gas for its generation. The PVPC (Voluntary Price for Small Consumers) means higher electricity bills due to compensation for thermal power plants and increased use of gas and coal during the heatwave. Once this unusual heatwave subsides, it will be seen if PVPC-referenced bills decrease when all air conditioners are no longer running simultaneously. On June 18, the extraordinary heatwave that affected Spain between June 11-12 and June 18 came to an end, being described as \"intense, extensive, and extraordinary,\" according to the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET), which also highlighted that this spring heat episode was one of the earliest in the country since records began. On June 20, Monday until 12 p.m., the Zaragoza City Council extended the orange alert of the Civil Protection Emergency Plan for the heatwave, which had been activated on Tuesday, June 14, due to the high temperatures affecting the city, exceeding 40°C on several days and not dropping below 25°C on some nights. On July 6, the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) published a report detailing the month of June, highlighting the intense heat episode that extended from the first day of the month until June 19, with both maximum and minimum temperatures well above normal, particularly high during the central days of the month, due to an invasion of warm air from North Africa. The heatwave in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands between June 11 and 18, 2022, was the earliest occurrence in the series, matching records with the one that occurred on June 11, 1981."

The episode began on Sunday, June 12, 2022, when temperatures above 40°C were recorded at 47 stations of the State Meteorological Agency (Aemet) network, located in Andalusia, Extremadura, and Castilla-La Mancha. This heatwave follows two other related climatic episodes in Spain in 2022: the widespread drought in the winter of 2021-2022 and the hottest May of the 21st century. The heat caused hundreds of swift chicks to prematurely leave their nests, falling to the ground as they did not know how to fly. The Seville-based NGO Ecourbe, dedicated to biodiversity conservation, reported that up to one hundred chicks were collected from the ground in a single day in Córdoba and Seville. Comisiones Obreras of Extremadura demanded that the reduction of the working day by one hour for construction workers be brought forward, as this reduction is applied from July 15 to mid-August. On June 15, the Madrid City Council activated the red alert protocol for meteorology, given the forecast of a combination of temperatures above 35°C and wind gusts of more than 55 km/h, and consequently closed nine parks in the Spanish capital. The high temperatures, along with the drought, created conditions of extreme risk for forest fires throughout peninsular Spain, except for Galicia, most of the border with Portugal, and isolated points along the coast. A fire in the Sierra de la Culebra (Zamora) forced the evacuation of eight municipalities, while another fire in the province of Toledo led to the evacuation of 3,200 people from the Puy du Fou España theme park. High temperatures in schools caused an increase in dizziness and fainting among children. Families, teachers, and experts called for a plan to adapt schools to future heatwaves, which they will face if no action is taken for the next school year. Air conditioning should be the last resort to lower temperatures in schools, as it accelerates climate change, which in the coming years will cause more frequent and extreme heatwaves. The Community of Madrid manages four public swimming pools in the capital. Until Thursday, June 16, the intention was to keep them closed until the end of June. Swimming in pools alleviates the unpleasant thermal sensation caused by extreme heat, so public complaints led the Sports Councilor, Marta Rivera de La Cruz, to change the opening plan for these public pools. She apologized to the people of Madrid: \"It is true that the heatwave should have brought forward that opening.\" She announced that next year they will open at the beginning of the month, as was historically done until 2019. On Monday, June 20, hospitals in Zaragoza recorded an \"unusual peak\" in emergencies due to the heatwave. Some patients had to wait more than 60 hours to be admitted due to a lack of beds, with conditions caused in elderly and chronically ill people by the prolonged heatwave of the previous week. This new workload due to the heatwave adds to the burden that hospital emergency staff have been enduring for more than two years."

Particularly in the vicinity of Nijmegen, the river was completely frozen for several weeks. Mid-February, the thaw set in. This resulted in a large amount of meltwater from the Alps and German low mountain ranges, causing the water level of the Waal to rise rapidly. On February 27, 1784, the ice near Nijmegen broke loose. Further downstream near Druten, however, the river was still blocked. Behind this ice dam, chunks of ice and meltwater began to accumulate. In an attempt to prevent a disaster, the local population quickly tried to raise the dikes. However, it was all in vain, and over time, the dikes broke through in no fewer than eleven places. Nijmegen also flooded, and the lower wall tower of the Valkhof (the Lappentoren) collapsed. On March 19, the dikes gave way near the village of Haalderen. The residents were completely taken by surprise, and 15 of them lost their lives. The village was almost entirely destroyed. The castles of Ooij, Lent, and Persingen were lost. 200 years later (in 1984), a memorial was erected in Haalderen in remembrance of the disaster. The pools or wheels created during the disaster are still visible today."

This was the second time in just over a year, following the flood of 1775. Both were severe storms with an estimated recurrence interval of 254 years. Northwest Overijssel was particularly hard hit. The village of Beulake was destroyed for the second time and subsequently abandoned. The writer Hering describes the following about the village in the book \"Bespiegeling over Neerlandsch waternood, tusschen den XXIsten en XXIIsten november, MDCCLXXVI, Amsterdam\":\n\n\"In Beulake, the situation was particularly dire. This village, due to its proximity to the sea dike and thus exposed to the first assault of the water, and mostly consisting of large peat bogs, was the first and most affected by the sea's fury: the houses and peat barns of the inhabitants were swiftly destroyed by the waves; their peat (the trade of which was the only means of livelihood for the residents) and even large pieces of peatland drifted away.\"\n\nIn Mastenbroek, four people drowned, including a mother and two children in the Koekoekspolder. In Elburg, the waves destroyed eleven homes, with seven people drowning. In many places, the water rose higher than in 1775. Shipworms caused a permanent crisis in the technology and financing of shoreline protection in the Netherlands. The islands in the Zuiderzee were heavily affected, particularly Schokland. In some places, the island disappeared underwater. A three-masted ship stranded near the 'Swartendijk' by Kampen even drifted over the island. On Urk, since 1773, the erosion of the High Cliff north of the lighthouse, the highest part of the boulder clay hill, had increased to the point that new measures had to be taken every year. However, the November storms of 1775 and especially 1776 severely damaged the boulder clay cliff despite the row of poles. A large portion was washed away, \"along with two houses on the northwest side [... while] the lighthouse was also stripped of all its foreground.\"\n\nThe island of Wieringen was also heavily affected. Four people and between 2,000 and 3,000 sheep drowned. On Texel, several dikes broke. The village of Oudeschild was abandoned by three-quarters of its inhabitants, who fled to higher places on the island. Five fishermen drowned. Several ships anchored at the Texel Roads were lost. In the following days, many bodies washed ashore. In Harlingen, a 14-year-old girl drowned. Off the coast of Scheveningen, the galleot ship Neptunus was lost. Of the nine crew members, seven were rescued."

The city of Kampen was flooded due to a dike breach nearby. The flooding happened so quickly that the city was already underwater before residents could move their belongings upstairs, transport livestock to higher ground, or bring themselves to safety. In Elburg, 28 people drowned. Dikes also broke in other places, such as on Texel and in the river area. In Amsterdam, Jacob Eduard de Witte saved the city from disaster by opening the Amstel sluice and the locks in the city walls. North of Amsterdam, however, dikes did break, and part of Waterland was flooded. The village of Oosthuizen was affected by flooding after the dike breach at Warder. Around the walls of Amsterdam, only water could be seen. A year later, the Zuiderzee region was hit again by a flood disaster, the flood of 1776. It is likely that the 1775 event involved a northeasterly storm and the 1776 event a southwesterly storm. Both were severe storms with an estimated recurrence interval of 254 years."

The city of Antwerp was also severely affected, resulting in significant material damage. In Zeeland, 102 polders were flooded: 40 in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, 20 in Zuid-Beveland, 19 in Tholen, 12 in Schouwen-Duiveland, 7 in Noord-Beveland, and 4 in Walcheren. Veere and the coastal city of Vlissingen were heavily impacted; there were 4 and 31 fatalities respectively. The Vlissingsche Courant reported on January 19: Today, within this city, the sorrowful ceremony took place, which perhaps may never happen again, being the solemn burial of the unfortunate victims who perished in the recent flood. A list of 31 victims follows, including many residents of Paardestraat. In Veere, a woman and two children lost their lives in Wijngaardstraat, and a woman drowned in Kapelstraat. In Zierikzee, a man drowned in his home, and in Goedereede, a watchman perished. In the city of Antwerp, a young girl drowned. Altogether, 43 people lost their lives in Zeeland during the flood. After the disaster, King Louis Napoleon visited Zeeland and took decisive measures such as raising dikes. This earned him much credit among the common people. In response to the flood, the Haarlem writer Adriaan Loosjes (1761-1818) wrote the tragedy Ewoud van Lodijke or the downfall of the Zeeland city of Romerswaal, which centers on the Saint Felix Flood of 1530. The proceeds from the work were donated to the victims of the 1808 disaster."

On the East Frisian Islands, in the Altes Land, Wilhelmsburg, the Vier- and Marschlande, as well as in the Winsen Elbe Marsh, there were dike breaches, floods, and subsequent severe destruction caused by ice drift. The aftermath extended into March 1855."

After the wind calmed down, it picked up again in the evening with the rising tide. This developed into a storm surge that lasted until the following day. In the subsequent eight weeks, there was persistent frost, which froze the flooded water and parts of the North Sea. At the beginning of March 1855, thawing began on the Elbe, releasing the frozen masses of water. Additionally, on March 19, another storm set the ice masses in motion."

The residents of the northern island beach fled to the southern part of the island on January 1, 1855. Of the 75 residential houses in the village of Wangerooge, 21 were destroyed. Graves were exposed in the cemetery. Seawater pushed up through the groundwater into wells. The protective dune wall in the area of the West Tower was leveled. The North Sea beach was eroded by up to 1 meter. The island was divided into three parts. The main island was reduced to only 175 hectares (for comparison: today it is around 500 hectares). Under the eroded dunes of Old Wangerooge, remains of brick and lime walls, wooden gutters, and refuse heaps from an earlier settlement were uncovered at a depth of 3.5 meters. In the north, hewn sandstone was found, which may have served as house foundations in the medieval original settlement of Oppidum Wangerooch. After the storm, a government commission from Oldenburg assessed the damage. There was no insurance against storm surge damage. The old lighthouse was particularly at risk and was to be rebuilt in the southeast of the island. The bathing facility, which had served as a source of income since 1804, was destroyed and would later be dissolved. With emergency aid of 100 Reichstaler, a new cemetery was established in the eastern dunes. The community buried 27 recovered bodies there. A final decision on relief measures was announced for the end of March. A few days after the flood, winter set in. Wangerooge was surrounded by drift ice for over eight weeks, making traffic with the mainland impossible. Particularly affected were 80 families, including 29 widows, orphans, and elderly people. Relief shipments arrived in the spring. In June 1855, the government commission saw no hope for reconstruction. They urged the islanders to resettle on the mainland. The resettlers received financial support. 82 Wangerooge residents refused to leave the island. In 1865, they founded a new village near the lighthouse completed in 1856."

In the Winsen Marsh, it was possible to travel over the ice to Winsen, which was normally very difficult due to poor road conditions. In the houses on the Elbe dike up to Haue, people had to live in the attics. At the sexton's house in Marschacht or on mounds, the ice reached window height. When the thaw set in, no water could flow off via the Elbe due to solid ice formation. The meltwater, thus dammed up from the upper Elbe, caused the water in the marsh and its houses to rise further. A storm set the masses of ice in motion. In Fahrenholz, buildings were destroyed, and in Tönnhausen, all houses on the dike were damaged. Trees were uprooted by the ice, for example, up to 100 old oaks near Sangenstedt. Uprooted trees piled up around the villages and hindered relief efforts."

Because water threatened to flow over the dike in several places, the dike was raised with manure and earth. The water rose to over 6 meters until the dike broke at dike cable 157. Water flowed into the Elbe field for hours. The dike in the Ilmenau marsh broke in several places. Of the places not located on the dike, only a few could be saved. In Echem, a significant rise in water was noticed. In Garlstorf, water stood in the gardens. The elevated Mariental was spared. In Hörstenfeld, the ice began to move. Animals and buildings were damaged, among others, in Laßrönne and Haue. In the Vorgeest villages of Handorf, Rottorf, and Sangenstedt, water flowed through the windows into the houses. The water destroyed the timber and clay framework. The water surface froze into an ice field and swept everything away in the brack. After the dike breaches, people in all houses on the Elbe dike had to live in the attics. When a passage opened between the ice from Oldershausen to Rottorf, the office in Lüneburg sent relief ships. On the country road, ships instead of wagons then traveled, landing near Wittorf. The ships brought food and transported livestock and furniture out on the return trip. In the geest villages of Rottorf, Handorf, and Wittorf, many people migrated with their livestock."

To restore the dikes, Artlenburg employed 100 workers daily. For the emergency dike alone, 500 cubic rods of earth (approximately 3,000 cubic meters) were needed; a large ship could transport about 2.5 cubic rods. Fertile soil was covered by sand, which in some places was over 1 meter high. Approximately 1,000 acres of land (about 2,500,000 square meters), which had been spared from previous dike breaches, were covered with sand. From the cemetery established in Artlenburg in 1851, 40 of the 200 coffins were carried away by the water but were recovered. The deceased were partially kept in the churchyard but were also transferred to Schnakenbek and Marienthal. Victims of the flood were buried in Schnakenbek. The churchyard was restored with drift sand. As long as the corpses could not be buried, their storage was problematic. In Marschacht, they were stored in the tower[8] for weeks. In Handorf, they were initially housed in the St. Mary’s Church and buried in Bardowick at the end of March. By mid-April, burials resumed in Handorf. People gradually returned to their villages, where they initially had to share the highest-lying houses. Due to a persistently high water level, the harvests that year were very poor. By late summer, at least fodder could be harvested. The price of grain rose sharply. Positive consequences of the flood included the founding of the Artlenburg Dike Association, the Ilmenau Lowland Water Association, and the Ilmenau Lowland Melioration Project."

The villages of Doornik and Haarsteeg were particularly hard hit. After the thaw set in at the end of January, the first ice blockages began causing problems in the Nijmegen area between February 1 and 4, later also downstream. Around February 15, the first dikes broke. In Millingen, 15 houses were destroyed. On February 21, the dike near the village of Doornik broke in two places. During this breach of the Waal, 17 people drowned, and all eighteen houses, including the church, were lost. After this, the village of Doornik was never fully rebuilt. Downstream, problems arose in Rossum, where a mill was destroyed, and in Haarsteeg, where several dozen houses, including the town hall, were completely destroyed by water and ice floes; 12 lives were lost. This event seemed to have come entirely unexpectedly: a massive ice floe reportedly simply pushed over the dike. The church was also destroyed in this event. After this disaster, it was decided to abandon the dangerous protruding corner of the dike, which had been breached twice in four years, and replace it with an inward straight-line dike. 838 · 1014 · 1042 · 1134 · 1163 · 1164 · 1170 · 1196 · 1212 · 1214 · 1219 · 1220 · 1221 · 1248/1249 · 1277 · 1280 · 1282 · 1287 · 1288 (I) · 1288 (II) · 1322 · 1334 · 1362 · 1374 · 1375 · 1377 · 1404 · 1421 · 1424 · 1468 · 1477 · 1509 · 1514 · 1530 · 1532 · 1552 · 1566 · 1570 · 1610 · 1643 · 1651 · 1675 · 1682 · 1686 · 1703 · 1717 · 1726 · 1741 · 1775 · 1776 · 1784 · 1799 · 1808 · 1809 · 1820 · 1825 · 1855 · 1861 (I) · 1861 (II) · 1877 · 1906 · 1916 · 1926 · 1953 · 1962 · 1993 · 1995 · 2006 · 2021"

                "content": "The All Saints' Flood of 2006 was a storm surge on the German North Sea coast on November 1, 2006 (All Saints' Day), which particularly caused damage in East Frisia. The flood is considered one of the most severe on the coast since 1906. No lives were lost. Near Norden, cattle were evacuated just in time from the foreland outside the dike. The cause of the flood was the hurricane low \"Britta\" from the northwest, which, together with the tidal level, generated a spring tide. The hurricane stormed over the North Sea with up to twelve Beaufort, with the highest wind speed recorded on the island of Spiekeroog (156 km/h). Off Borkum, the highest water level since the storm surge of 1962 was recorded, and in Emden and at the (timely closed) Ems Barrier in Gandersum, even the highest values ever measured: In Emden, the water rose to 3.59 m above the mean high tide (MThw), in Gandersum to 3.90 m above MThw. In Bensersiel, 2.91 meters above MThw were reached, the third-highest water level after the storm surges of 1906 and 1962. Damage was caused in Emden in the sections of the harbor located outside the dike. The building of the ferry company AG Ems was flooded. Near Neuharlingersiel, a landing craft about 30 meters long was lifted out of the harbor basin by the force of the water and ended up nearly 100 meters inland on a parking lot after the flood. In the marina of Norddeich, several boats were destroyed. On the East Frisian Islands, the storm surge caused significant dune erosion. In the Port of Hamburg, the hurricane tore a ship from the quay, which was secured again with tugboats. A coastal motor ship about 100 meters long got into distress off Borkum after the rudder system failed. The Norwegian drilling platform \"Bredford Dolphin\" was torn loose from its tug at sea. In both cases, no people were harmed."

The flood was associated with heavy ice drift and added to the destruction caused by the storm surges of 1509 and 1510. The flood and the accompanying ice floes caused massive damage to the dikes, particularly in Rüstringen and Butjadingen. Since the dikes could no longer be repaired in many places, it became necessary to abandon several villages and parishes. For example, in the Jade Bight near Sande, this affected the parishes of Oldebrügge, Bordum, Bant, Ahm, Ellens, Seediek, as well as the Johanniter Commandery Havermonniken. Another series of parishes had already been abandoned in the 15th century. The land losses in the Dollart, the Jade Bight, and between the Jade and Weser were significant. Arngast became an island in the Jade Bight. The Dollart and the Jade Bight reached their greatest extent, and a breakthrough occurred between the Jade and Weser. The sinking of the village \"Bandt\" in the Antoniflood, now a district (\"Bant\") of Wilhelmshaven, is commemorated by the \"Banter Ruine\" monument in Wilhelmshaven, erected in 1889, which is modeled after the ruins of the Banter Church."

Later chroniclers reported that 30,600 people were said to have lost their lives in this flood, which is likely a typographical error for 36,000.

The storm surges are named after Saint Dionysius of Paris, whose feast day is October 9. In Flanders, about seventeen villages and a monastery were destroyed in 1374 and 1375. In East Frisia, according to excerpts from 16th-century chronicles, there were devastating dike breaches in 1374 and the following years. After the flood, the Leybucht reached its largest extent at about 13,000 hectares, and the village of Westeel had to be abandoned. Subsequently, the flood is said to have reached the town of Norden, where the waves reached the walls of the Dominican monastery. The town then gained access to the North Sea and acquired a harbor. Through the now silted-up bays of Sielmönken and Campen, the water also penetrated deep inland. In the late 14th century, the parishes of Drewert and Walsum, as well as the village of Ham, were destroyed in the Rysumer Nacken area. The historian Ubbo Emmius reported on the effects in the 1590s: \"On October 9, 1373 (!), there was a great flood, such as had not been seen in living memory, which extended over the entire Frisian coast and brought great misfortune to the inhabitants. For it covered the notable village of Westeel, located in a fertile area almost 2,000 paces south of Norden and facing east towards the rising sun, with such a quantity of water that all buildings, including the church, were torn down and destroyed, and even part of the ground was swallowed up, with people and animals disappearing.\""

There was one fatality at the Ochtum. On the Knechtsand in the Outer Weser, the Danish coastal motor ship Balka (299 GRT) ran aground after becoming unmanageable with a heavy list.

On the islands in the Lower Weser as well as on Krautsand, buildings located on insufficiently high mounds were flooded for the second time within a week. On the East Frisian Islands and on Sylt, dune erosion occurred. The situation at the sea dike in front of Christianskoog in the Meldorfer Bay also became critical."

In Hamburg, this storm surge almost reached the peak water level of the 1962 storm surge, even though there was no storm in the city itself, but rather very strong winds. Although there were no dike breaches, there was very severe damage in the flooded harbor area, where numerous businesses were caught off guard by the unexpectedly high surge. The sea dike in front of Christianskoog, which had not been raised after the 1962 storm surge, was again severely damaged and could only be held with massive deployment of emergency forces. At sea, the anchor chain of the lightship Elbe II, which was still stationed in the Elbe estuary at the time, broke due to the storm. The lightship ran aground in the Klotzenloch off Cuxhaven and was later salvaged by tugboats. The crew was rescued by the rescue boat Rickmer Bock, which was on reserve in Cuxhaven. Five nautical miles north of the lightship Elbe I, the Hamburg motor vessel Grete Hauschildt (424 GRT) sank after the hatch covers were smashed in the heavy seas. Despite a dramatic rescue operation involving several helicopters, the ferry ship Prinz Hamlet, and the supertanker Fernhaven, only three of the seven crew members could be saved."

                "content": "Their mention was based on various reports from Flanders and East Frisia, which originally referred to the years 1374 and 1375. Later chronicles shifted the floods to 1376 or 1377, although in Flanders it was claimed that the flood had occurred on November 16 (the Monday after Martinmas). In East Frisian chronicles, a second Dionysius flood of 1377 then appeared, which was believed to have worsened the damage from 1377. The adherence to the year 1377 is presumably a reference to late medieval flood myths, which emphasized that Lamech and his 77 descendants had drowned in the flood as a punishment from God.[1] The coastal researchers Petrus Georg Bartels and Dodo Wildvang strongly adhered to this date, but Carl Woebcken expressed his doubts early on. The Dutch researcher Elisabeth Gottschalk determined from the sources that there is \"not a single piece of evidence\" for a Dionysius flood in 1377, although some damage to the Flemish dikes in November of that year cannot be ruled out.[2] Additional climate studies have confirmed her findings. In Flanders, around seventeen villages and a monastery were destroyed in 1374 and 1375. The Zuudzee or Braakman bay was formed, which later—like its counterpart at the Ems estuary—was also likely called Dollaert. This number was doubled by the East Frisian chroniclers. In East Frisia, according to excerpts from 16th-century chronicles, there were devastating dike breaches in the Leybucht area in 1374 and the following years, during which the village of Westeel was destroyed. Subsequently, the flood is said to have reached the town of Norden, where the waves reached the walls of the Dominican monastery. The town then had access to the North Sea and gained a harbor. Through the now silted-up bays of Sielmönken and Campen, the water also penetrated deep inland. In the late 14th century, the parishes of Drewert and Walsum as well as the village of Ham were destroyed at the Rysumer Nacken.[3]"

It is named after Cosmas and Damian, whose feast day is September 26. In East Frisia and the neighboring Netherlands, the flood caused devastating damage in the Rheiderland and the adjacent Oldambt. The villages of Torum, Wilgum, Fletum, Westerreide, and Osterreide, as well as the Palmar Monastery, had to be abandoned as a result of the natural disaster. The later chancellor of the Lordship of Jever, Remmer von Seediek, reported in his chronicle of the Jeverland: \"In the year 1509, on the day of Cosmas and Damian, a great flood occurred in all the Netherlands. It destroyed many dikes in Östringen and Wangerland and especially in Rüstringen. Large whirlpools broke in there, and the dikes broke miserably, so that Junker Edo had enough to do with land and people for two years before the dikes were restored.\" The Dollart reached its greatest extent, and the Jade Bight also expanded significantly. Near Emden, the Ems broke through a river bend and created a new riverbed, which meant that Emden was no longer a direct seaport, the harbor silted up, and economic decline set in."
