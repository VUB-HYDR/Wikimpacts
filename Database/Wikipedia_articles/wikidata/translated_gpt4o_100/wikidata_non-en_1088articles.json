                "content": "The eyewitness Emo of Wittewierum, the later abbot of the Premonstratensian monastery of Wittewierum near Groningen, recorded in the Chronicon abbatum in Werum that on January 16, 1219, \"in the 55th year after the Julian flood,\" the \"bloodthirsty southwest wind,\" which had already brought hail for days, turned into a storm, shifted to northwest during the night under a full moon, and caused major floods that overtopped the dikes and washed away houses. Abbot Emo attempted a natural-philosophical explanation but ultimately interpreted the Marcellus flood and the subsequent famine as a deluge \"because of our crimes.\" The wealthy marsh farmers had not thought of the poor; therefore, they lost their land. According to an unreliable report in the Saxon World Chronicle, this severe storm surge, erroneously dated to November 17, 1218, claimed about 36,000 lives along the North Sea coast. The Colmar Annals even mention a figure of 50,000 victims. West Friesland in today's Netherlands was particularly hard hit. There, the North Sea broke through a naturally formed sand barrier, creating the Zuiderzee (southern sea), a sea bay that is now artificially separated from the North Sea as the IJsselmeer.\n\nSome chronicles from the 16th century attributed the formation of the Jade Bight to this storm surge. According to these accounts, the water broke through at the former village mound of Alt-Gödens after destroying the legendary Schlicker Sluice, which was said to have copper doors. However, the parishes allegedly flooded at that time (Oldessen, Dauerns, Hummens, Jadele, Dangast, Arngast, and Alt-Gödens or Lee) still existed in the 1420s. Only Hiddels had already disappeared. Consequently, the expansion of the Jade Bight is to be dated to the course of the 15th century, significantly later than the storm surge legend suggests."

Rivers flooded particularly in South Ostrobothnia and Northern Satakunta. According to meteorologist Matti Huutonen, in some places, as much rain fell in 24 hours (October 5–6) as normally falls in a month. Even outside the flood area, for example in Kokemäki and Pori, daily rainfall amounts of over 30 millimeters were recorded. In Ilmajoki, main road 67 had to be closed due to flooding. Roads were also closed elsewhere in South Ostrobothnia. In Kankaanpää, water also rose onto the roads. In Ilmajoki, Kauhajoki, and Lapväärtti, several houses were surrounded by water, and basements were flooded. In Kauhajoki, residents had to be relocated to temporary accommodations. MTV3 reported on October 8 that the flood situation was already easing, but added that it would take at least a week before water levels returned to normal for the time of year. In contrast, the flood situation in Satakunta remained severe, as Yle reported on October 15 that an additional 20 millimeters of rain was expected there. According to Bertel Vehviläinen, the leading hydrologist at the Finnish Environment Institute, the flood of the Kyrönjoki River was the largest ever recorded in Finland. Many other rivers in South Ostrobothnia also reached record-high levels."

The precipitation was caused by the Vb low-pressure system \"Ilse.\" A ridge of the high-pressure system \"Friedmann\" over Scandinavia caused the low to be deflected southward from its usual west-east trajectory toward the Mediterranean. Here, these air masses warmed significantly due to the seasonal conditions and absorbed a lot of moisture. After crossing the Alps northward, they encountered the cold air there, cooled down significantly, and resulted in extreme precipitation within a relatively short period. The rainfall initially concentrated along the path of the low-pressure system on Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, and the Czech Republic, and subsequently intensified in eastern Germany. Here, the low-pressure system stalled and completely rained itself out by the end of its lifecycle. The rainfall was further intensified by orographically induced lifting processes over the Alps, but especially along the low mountain ranges (Ore and Giant Mountains). A similar weather pattern was also the cause of the Oder flood in 1997."

                "content": "A first heavy rainfall event occurred on August 6/7, with focal points in the Chiemgau and Berchtesgadener Land regions. Over 48 hours, widespread precipitation of more than 100 mm was recorded, corresponding to about two-thirds of the average monthly mean (1961–1990) for August. The highest daily rainfall of 117 mm was registered in Ruhpolding on August 6; at Wendelstein, 62 mm of rain fell within just 6 hours. This event led to soil saturation and set the stage for the actual, even higher flood event caused by rainfall from August 10 to 12. On the evening of August 10, a series of thunderstorms moved into Bavaria from the west, which subsequently developed into widespread continuous rain, leading to daily precipitation of over 100 mm along the Alpine foothills on August 11. On August 12, the focus shifted to the Bavarian and Upper Palatinate Forests, resulting in a 100-year rainfall event of 104 mm in 24 hours in Waldkirchen. From August 6 to 12, over 340 mm of rain was recorded in parts of southern Bavaria. On August 12, flood peaks formed on the Danube tributaries Iller, Günz, Mindel, Zusam, Schmutter, Paar, and Lech. In the Oberallgäu district, some 100-year events were observed. On August 14, a long wave formed on the Danube between the Lech estuary and Regensburg, corresponding to a 10- to 20-year flood event. Also on August 12, peak levels were reached on the rivers Isar, Loisach, Ammer, Mangfall, Tiroler Achen, Traun, Saalach, and Salzach, with return periods ranging from 50 to 100 years. The flood wave of the Inn River led to a water level of 10.80 m and a discharge of 7,700 m³/s in Passau on August 13 at 1 p.m., corresponding to a 50-year event. This level was last exceeded in 1954 (12.20 m) and again in 2013 (12.89 m). While the Salzach flood near Burghausen reached a 50-year magnitude, the Inn River in Wasserburg experienced only a 2- to 5-year event. Thus, the 20- to 50-year flood of the Inn downstream of the Salzach confluence was significantly influenced by the Salzach. The Sylvenstein reservoir retained up to 23.3 million cubic meters of water, preventing a larger flood on the Isar. Without the reservoir, up to 730 m³/s would have flowed through Bad Tölz on August 12 instead of the recorded 295 m³/s. With the rain area shifting northward, an extreme flood with return periods of well over 100 years occurred on the night of August 13 on rivers in the Regen and Ilz catchment areas. At the confluence of the Regen and Danube in Regensburg, a water level of 6.63 m was recorded on August 14 at 1 p.m., leading to a 20-year flood up to the Isar confluence near Deggendorf and a 10-year flood further downstream to Passau."

                "content": "The rain situation was particularly dramatic in the central and eastern Ore Mountains, where on August 12/13, 2002, a 24-hour value of 312 mm was recorded in Zinnwald, the highest daily rainfall amount ever registered in Germany since the start of routine measurements. Due to the poor forest condition in these areas and the already absorbed water quantities, the soil could not store such massive amounts of rainfall, causing the water to immediately flow into the valleys. Rivers originating in this region and flowing into the Mulde or Elbe, such as Zschopau, Flöha, Zwickauer Mulde, Freiberger Mulde, Gimmlitz, Rote Weißeritz, Wilde Weißeritz, and Müglitz, swelled to many times their usual size within hours, leaving enormous damage in their wake. Many bridges were washed away, roads undermined, houses flooded and severely damaged, power and telephone supplies collapsed, entire villages were evacuated or cut off from the outside world. The Müglitz Valley was particularly affected. Here, the flood wave devastated Glashütte, Schlottwitz, Weesenstein, Mühlbach, Burkhardswalde, the lower town of Dohna, and Heidenau. In Glashütte, a small retention basin on the Prießnitz, a lower tributary of the Müglitz, broke on August 12, 2002, around 5:00 PM. The flood wave, estimated at 50,000 cubic meters of water in the Prießnitz Valley, raised the water level in Glashütte by another meter but had little impact on the flooding in the Müglitz because the Prießnitzbach flows into the Müglitz further downstream. In many places, energy, water, and heat supplies failed. The flooding of federal, state, and district roads hindered emergency services. In the area of the Gottleuba and Seidewitz rivers, the flood reached the threshold of flooding in Pirna on August 12 around 5:00 PM. The Gottleuba and Seidewitz overflowed their banks up to 1.50 meters after their confluence in Pirna. In Dresden, the damage was caused not only by the first wave of the Weißeritz on August 12/13 but also by the second, higher wave of the Elbe on August 16/17. On August 12, 2002, at around 6:00 PM, a disaster alarm was declared for Dresden. In the city center, the main train station, the Semper Opera House, the Zwinger, and the state parliament were flooded. Parts of Friedrichstadt were evacuated. In the following days, the disaster situation exceeded flood warning level IV in some places. Built-up areas were partially completely flooded, and the use of water and dam defenses on a larger scale became necessary. There were also fatalities. Only on August 13, 2002, did the full extent of the natural disaster become visible. Other places were enclosed by the subsequent masses of water and cut off from the outside world. In Krippen, the water rose to the second floor. Grimma was hit by the Mulde flood and severely destroyed, including the historic Pöppelmann Bridge. On August 14, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder visited the city. The city of Döbeln was also completely flooded by the Freiberger Mulde. In the evening, tram operations in Dresden were completely suspended. On August 15, Meißen was hit by the first flood wave, partially destroying the local porcelain manufactory. By this time, Pirna had already been reached by the second wave. Entire villages in Saxon Switzerland had to be evacuated. In Dresden, the districts of Laubegast, Kleinzschachwitz, and Zschieren were flooded. On August 16, train traffic on the Leipzig–Dresden, Riesa–Chemnitz, and Jüterbog–Röderau lines, which cross the Elbe floodplain on a shared embankment, was suspended. A dike breach near Röderau caused the overflowing Elbe to undermine a road bridge and a flood culvert of the railway embankment, causing these structures to collapse. In the evening, the flood peak reached Schöna at the Czech border with a maximum level of 12.04 meters. On August 17, 2002, the water level in Dresden reached its peak of 9.40 meters at 7:00 AM. On that day, all Dresden Elbe bridges except the A4 motorway bridge were closed. In absolute comparison of flow rates, the 2002 Elbe flood ranked fifth among recorded floods in Saxony. Such floods are therefore assumed to have a recurrence interval of 100 to 200 years. The Torgau gauge reached a peak value of 9.49 meters on August 18. On August 26, the disaster alarm for Dresden was lifted. A total of 21 people lost their lives in Saxony due to the flood."

By the evening of August 14, around 4,600 people had been evacuated from low-lying districts of Dessau. In the Bitterfeld-Wolfen chemical park (most affected was the Bayer Group), an environmental disaster was prevented through the massive deployment of helpers. The city of Bitterfeld itself became increasingly flooded in the following days. Near the city, a dam on the Mulde broke on August 15, flooding the former Goitzsche lignite mine. On the same day, the Pretziener Weir south of Magdeburg was opened, preventing the worst damage in the city area. Nevertheless, around 20,000 people were evacuated from the eastern districts of Magdeburg, and a state of emergency was declared for the city. Additionally, the Brandenburg town of Mühlberg was evacuated, and cities further downstream prepared protective measures. On the night of August 16 at 1 a.m., the crisis team decided to evacuate around 10,000 people from Bitterfeld and the surrounding area as the city was gradually being overtaken by the floodwaters. In Saxony-Anhalt alone, about 2,000 Bundeswehr soldiers were deployed. On August 17, the water level in Mühlberg reached its peak at 9.96 meters. On August 18, several dikes broke in Saxony-Anhalt near Seegrehna and Wittenberg on the Elbe, as well as near Dessau on the Mulde. In the Dessau district of Waldersee, the water quickly rose to two meters high. A sandbag logistics center was set up at Leipzig/Halle Airport to supply all endangered areas. On August 19, the situation on the A9 motorway escalated, but a single-lane traffic flow was ensured. The floodwaters moved north faster than expected. The first flood wave reached the state capital Magdeburg, which, not least due to the Elbe flood bypass canal, escaped relatively unscathed. On August 20, when the village center of Rehsen was threatened with flooding, the residents of the village manually breached the dike of the inhabited Schönitzer polder to relieve their own dike. The fire chief of Rehsen and four other individuals were subsequently charged by the public prosecutor's office with dike destruction but were ultimately acquitted due to a lack of evidence of specific involvement. By August 21, more than 60,000 people had been evacuated from endangered areas in Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. On August 22, around 16,300 Bundeswehr soldiers were deployed in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Brandenburg. \n\nOn August 26, the state of emergency for Magdeburg was lifted. Due to the slow receding of the water, the state of emergency in Dessau could only be lifted on September 13, after 32 days."

Initially, South Bohemia was affected, including the catchment areas of the Vltava, Lužnice, Malše, and Blanice rivers, later followed by the Berounka, Otava, and Sázava rivers. From August 11, 2002, the water masses from the Ohře and Bílina rivers in Northwest Bohemia were added. Within nine days in August, the affected regions experienced rainfall equivalent to three summer months of the long-term average. Already in June and July, above-average rainfall had occurred, and the soil's storage capacity was exhausted. Initially, numerous locations in the flat area around České Budějovice were flooded, and the emerging danger was underestimated. The reservoirs of the Vltava, filled to the brim, should have released about 1000 m³/s of water preventively, which would have mitigated the later peak. At the beginning of the second week, the water level in Prague rose to a gauge height of seven meters. At this point, the spillways had to be opened. To the South Bohemian water masses from the Vltava with 3000 m³/s, an additional 2000 m³/s from the unregulated Sázava and Berounka rivers joined before Prague. In Prague, the normal flow rate is 150 m³/s; at this time, an estimated 5300 m³/s was reached. The flooding of the Old Town was prevented by barriers on the riverside streets. However, the subway ceased operations. The Karlín district had to be evacuated. At the confluence of the Vltava and Elbe rivers near Mělník, the water masses spread into the plain. The village of Zálezlice, located near the confluence, was two-thirds destroyed. At the bottleneck below in the Bohemian Switzerland region, the water accumulated. The transition to Germany occurred through the narrow Elbe Valley of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The peak level in Ústí nad Labem (Aussig) was reached on the afternoon of August 16, 2002. The water flow of the Elbe exceeded the previous highest level from 1845. The water volume in the Vltava exceeded the 1845 level by almost one-fifth."

Except for Orlík and Slapy, the machine houses of all Vltava hydroelectric power plants were flooded. Around 1,000 animals were evacuated from the Prague Zoo, but 134 others (including 10 mammals) died in the floods. The Prague Metro was two-fifths flooded and could only be fully operational again in March 2003. The damage to the subway amounted to around 280 million euros. Near the confluence of the Vltava and Elbe rivers, the Czech chemical and pharmaceutical plant Spolana in Neratovice was flooded, and waste and operating materials were washed away. One of the 17 flood victims was a 53-year-old man who was fatally struck by an iron fragment while watching the detonation of a drifting inland ship in Děčín."

Numerous politicians, including Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, regularly visited the affected areas under significant media attention.[32] The government quickly allocated 385 million euros to support those affected by the flood in rebuilding. Payments amounted to 500 euros per person and up to 2,000 euros per household. Affected businesses received a flat rate of 15,000 euros and 500 euros per employee.[33] On August 26, the government passed a draft law for a 7.1 billion euro state fund for reconstruction aid in the flood-affected areas,[13] which the Bundesrat approved on September 13.[34] A political science study concluded that the flood relief measures of the SPD-led German government increased the SPD's share of votes in the affected areas by up to seven percentage points in the 2002 federal elections and by two percentage points in the 2005 federal elections.[35] Critics argue that politics and administration drew only limited actual consequences from the flood. Of the 35,000 hectares identified in 2002 as potential floodplain areas along the Elbe, less than five percent were implemented. Additionally, construction bans stipulated in various state laws were often circumvented by district administrators through special permits.[36]"

Due to the flood disaster, the Schüssel I government, with the approval of the FPÖ ministers, decided to postpone the tax reform that had been promised to voters by the FPÖ. This and other differences of opinion prompted Haider and other members of the party's right-wing faction, such as Ewald Stadler, to demand the convening of a special party congress (Knittelfeld FPÖ Assembly 2002) from the party leadership under the relatively liberal Susanne Riess-Passer and to collect signatures from elected delegates for this purpose. The events of this assembly led to a power shift within the party, the resignation of several FPÖ ministers, the collapse of the first FPÖ-ÖVP coalition under Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, and ultimately early elections (Austrian National Council election 2002), in which the FPÖ lost almost two-thirds of its voters. The Freedom Party also suffered significant losses in voter support in most state elections (except in Carinthia) between 2003 and 2005. Similarly, in the municipal and mayoral elections in Carinthia in 2003, the municipal elections in Lower Austria in 2005, and later in Styria, the FPÖ lost voters. After the electoral defeat in the municipal elections in Lower Austria in 2005, the former FPÖ chairman Jörg Haider proposed a re-establishment of the FPÖ as a \"casual, dynamic, and young\" party, and stated that he would be willing to take over its leadership \"in an emergency.\" When this proposal did not receive unanimous approval within the party, and a contested vote against Vienna FPÖ chairman Heinz-Christian Strache loomed at a party congress scheduled for April 23, Haider announced on April 4, 2005, the founding of the new party Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) and declared his intention to become its first chairman. The BZÖ subsequently replaced the FPÖ in the Schüssel II government."

Affected areas included the Czech tributaries Vltava and Ohře, parts of the two Mulde rivers, and almost the entire course of the Elbe from Hradec Králové (Königgrätz) through the Czech and Saxon upper reaches to the northern German middle and lower reaches. Especially in the lower middle course, the flood is comparable to the flood of 2002, but it passed through the river in a much longer flood wave. At the beginning of April, some towns, such as Hitzacker in Lower Saxony, were largely flooded. The mark of the century flood of 2002 was reached or even exceeded in some places. In Lauenburg, this occurred as early as April 7."

                "content": "The trigger for the flooding was intense thawing in the low mountain ranges at the upper course of the Elbe. In the ridge areas of the Ore Mountains, Bohemian Central Uplands, as well as in the Bohemian Forest and Giant Mountains, snow depths of over 1.5 meters accumulated throughout the winter. Due to previous short thawing processes and the long duration of snow cover, the snow was comparatively highly compressed and water-rich. At the end of March, a rapid melting of the snow masses occurred due to a sharp temperature rise and heavy precipitation. In the Ore Mountains, precipitation was comparatively low, so there was no dangerous flooding in the tributaries of the upper Elbe. At the beginning of March, these waters had already experienced flooding, which appeared more dangerous due to ice jams. Heavy precipitation fell at the end of March, particularly in southern Czechia and the central Bohemian Basin. Further causes must be sought for the significant swelling of the river in the lower middle course. On the one hand, in the southern middle course, especially in Saxony-Anhalt, dike systems were raised and renewed along entire stretches since 2002. These withstood the Elbe and prevented the flooding of retention areas as in 2002. This is accompanied by unfavorable river construction. Another reason for exceeding the 2002 flood mark north of Magdeburg lies in the stretched flood wave, which triggered the highest alarm levels simultaneously along the several hundred kilometers from Lower Saxony to the Moldau estuary. In the middle course, the flow velocity decreased, leading to the compression of the wave."

The cause of the prolonged and heavy rainfall was a Vb weather pattern. In this pattern, air masses deviate from their usual west-east direction towards the Mediterranean to the south. Here, these air masses warm up and absorb a lot of moisture. After crossing the Alps northward, they encounter the cold air there, cool down significantly, and result in extreme precipitation in a relatively short time. This weather pattern was also the cause of the Oder flood (1997) and the Elbe flood (2002)."

                "content": "Starting on September 24, 2010, there were widespread heavy rains in the Elbe-Elster region. Between Fläming and the Saxon Upper Lusatia, more than 100 liters of rain per square meter fell in some areas from September 24 to September 27. As a result, on September 29, the Schwarze Elster and its two tributaries, Große Röder and Pulsnitz, which flow into it at Elsterwerda, reached flood warning level 4. After flood alert level 3 had already been declared throughout the Elbe-Elster district the day before and a crisis team had been formed, District Administrator Christian Jaschinski was forced to declare a disaster alert at 11:50 a.m. on this day. Due to further rising water levels, preparations began in Elsterwerda, where the water level of the Schwarze Elster had risen to about 3.50 meters, for the voluntary evacuation of the city center, which was at risk of flooding. At the official gauge in Bad Liebenwerda, located about ten kilometers downstream, 3.50 meters were also measured. By evening, the tense situation required the closure of the first roads and bridges. While the newly constructed important Elster bridge in Elsterwerda remained open, bridges over the Schwarze Elster in Saathain and Bad Liebenwerda, as well as the partially flooded federal highway 169 near Plessa, the district road 6207 between Saathain and Stolzenhain, and the village road through Schmerkendorf, had to be closed. Near Ortrand, where the Pulsnitz overflowed its banks, the federal highway A 13 also had to be closed due to flooding. The escalating situation also attracted increased media interest, with several television teams from public and private broadcasters reporting live from the region. On Thursday, September 30, all schools in Elsterwerda, Bad Liebenwerda, and Herzberg, as well as schools in Annaburg, were closed for students affected by the flooding. On this day, maximum water levels were measured at all gauges along the Schwarze Elster, reaching record levels never before recorded. The measured peak flow of the Schwarze Elster in Löben was now 128 m³/s, corresponding to a discharge characteristic of HQ 200. The water level in Bad Liebenwerda reached an absolute record high of 3.55 meters during the night, never before measured. From then on, it began to slightly decrease here, while levels in downstream locations continued to rise. The situation remained critical at the increasingly softening dikes of the Schwarze Elster. Weak points and cracks, such as between Kotschka and Saathain, where the dike began to overflow over a length of about 50 meters, were sealed as quickly as possible with sandbags by emergency forces and the help of rushing residents. For safety reasons, the voluntary evacuation of about 2,700 residents began in Elsterwerda at this time, with police vehicles driving through the city and public notices urging residents to leave their homes and properties. The district hospital of the city, located in close proximity to the river, was also evacuated using ambulances and helicopters. About 100 patients were transferred within about four hours to nearby hospitals in Herzberg, Finsterwalde, Lauchhammer, Riesa, Großenhain, or Dresden. Despite all efforts by emergency forces, a disaster occurred the following day about twenty kilometers upstream from the Elster estuary. On October 1, at around 12:50 p.m., the left-side dike of the Schwarze Elster near Meuselko broke at a water level of 3.34 meters, measured at the Löben gauge. Just over four hours later, at around 5:00 p.m., a disaster alert was declared for the entire Wittenberg district. Eight hours later, parts of the village of Löben, located two kilometers downstream, were flooded, and the Waltersdorf district was cut off from the outside world. The prolonged peak of the flood ensured that the disaster alert for the Elbe-Elster district, except for the city of Herzberg/Elster, was not lifted until October 6. On October 7, with the permanent drop below flood warning level 4 at the Löben gauge, the disaster alert for the Wittenberg district and the city of Herzberg was lifted. The dike near Meuselko, which had broken over a length of about 30 meters, was closed on October 5, despite water levels remaining constant and in some cases still rising."

Additionally, up to 2,000 helpers were deployed. The estimated agricultural damages in Brandenburg amounted to approximately 3 million euros. The costs for the nine-day disaster operation in the Elbe-Elster district were stated to be up to 2 million euros. Immediate damages to hydraulic structures in the Wittenberg district caused by the flooding were estimated at 670,000 euros. The preliminary estimated costs for dike rehabilitation in Brandenburg (as of 2011) were stated to be up to 50 million euros, with an additional 50 million euros planned by the state of Saxony-Anhalt for the rehabilitation of dikes along the Schwarze Elster by 2020. In the eastern part of the Annaburg Heath, several hectares of forest were destroyed due to the over five-month-long flooding and a high groundwater level caused by the flood."

                "content": "Due to the significant straightening of the riverbed, which mostly took place in the mid-19th century, the Schwarze Elster now flows as a canal through the landscape. The extensive floodplain forests adjacent to the river and the meandering course of the Schwarze Elster disappeared, and recurring floods no longer had the opportunity to use these areas as compensation zones. As a result, water levels rose with each flood, leading to further expansion of flood protection measures. Just a few years after the regulation of the Schwarze Elster began, the newly constructed dikes broke in 1861 due to a flood. Flooding along the river was also reported in the years 1862, 1871, 1895, and 1907. Another devastating flood on the Schwarze Elster became known in 1926. A breach of the Röder dam near the small village of Würdenhain flooded the entire village on June 18, 1926. The flood affected nearly all rivers in the area, including the Röder, Pulsnitz, Schwarze Elster, and Kleine Elster, causing enormous damage. In the floodplain of the then-district of Bad Liebenwerda, two-thirds of the harvest was destroyed that year. Downstream, in the Mönchenhöfe area, up to 144 hectares of flooded land were reported. In June of the following year, during the summer flood near Mückenberg (Lauchhammer-West), a breach of the Elster dam occurred, which could only be closed with great effort."

However, due to its intensity and the extensive urban redevelopment it triggered, it holds lasting significance in the city's history. The flood is considered the culmination and northern endpoint of a geographically widespread flood situation that at the time dominated the course of the Upper and Middle Weser as well as some of its source and tributary rivers. Flood peaks of the Weser and its tributary Aller, caused by rain and snowmelt, converged near Verden. In Bremen, the flood encountered a critical river bend at the Weser weir, which was only limitedly controllable and significantly reduced the discharge cross-section, prompting the water to carve a new path instead. In the process, two summer dike breaches occurred immediately above and below the weir. Over 120 allotment gardens were destroyed, and massive landscape damage was caused. Although the plots were located in the designated overflow area and the flood remained within its bounds, hardly anyone had anticipated a flood of such magnitude \"from above\"—that is, as inland flooding. All dike construction measures up to that point had been aimed at protecting the allotment gardeners from storm surges from the sea. Under the impact of the Weser breakthrough, the responsible authorities developed a new flood management concept for the affected areas, which was gradually implemented in the following years. Relocations, expansions, and new constructions of dikes, roads, and waterways sustainably altered the city's landscape."

                "content": "Essentially, the Weser breakthrough in 1981 affected the southern Bremen district of Habenhausen, which is part of the Obervieland district. However, there were also landscape damages in other districts. Habenhausen – a neighborhood at the time almost exclusively characterized by residential buildings – is bordered by the Weser to the east and north. The river makes a sharp bend to the west around the district, where the Weser weir is located. The old structure, still existing in 1981, was built between 1906 and 1911 to create an artificial boundary against the tides and simultaneously ensure a minimum water level for inland navigation through a barrage. It separates the Middle Weser from the Lower Weser. Within this sharp river bend lies a wide area with grasslands and allotment gardens, which today make up about one-fifth of Habenhausen's area. This area experienced the most severe destruction as a result of the flood. The area is shielded from the Weser only by low summer dikes; only directly in front of the regular residential area further south does a winter dike protect the houses. With the Werder Bridge (officially called Karl Carstens Bridge today, colloquially known as the Strawberry Bridge), Habenhausen has had a long connection to the north since 1971, leading to the Hastedt district, which belongs to the Hemelingen district. At the southern foot of the bridge, there was a significant bend in the winter dike in 1981, where the floodwaters pressed with full flow intensity. This spot was later straightened. The second significant body of water in Habenhausen is the Werdersee, which was 2.7 kilometers long at the time. It was created between 1953 and 1960 in an east-west orientation according to plans by Wilhelm Hübotter, south of the Stadtwerder, as a flood channel and ended in 1981 about 180 meters west of the bridge. It was intended that the lake would protect Habenhausen from storm surges in case dikes broke along the Weser, which flows almost parallel further north. Additionally, it was supposed to absorb floodwaters that – like the Weser breakthrough – originated eastward in the Weser bend designated as an overflow area. The lake extended westward to the Deichschartweg, which ran on a small dam in a southwest-northeast direction. On the other side of the dam, the Kleine Weser continued, a small tributary of the Weser. There was only a connection between the Werdersee and the Kleine Weser through a few small culverts."

                "content": "On November 13, 1980, a routine flushing of the weir chamber was carried out in the left sector of the Bremen Weser Weir, which had been in operation since 1911. During this process, a defect occurred when the sector broke through the upper end position due to advanced corrosion of the locking mechanism, destroying the seals. It was immediately reset after the incident, preventing the dam stage from draining. By December 24 of the same year, the damaged seals were partially replaced; however, an emergency lock still made it impossible to control the sector. As a result, a serious problem arose: the more water flowed downstream, the greater the load on the functioning right weir field, while at the same time, the outflow was increasingly slowed. Calculations indicated that only 1,500 m³ of water per second could flow out regularly. \n\nIn the early days of March the following year, maritime polar air flowed into Germany, bringing light rain or snowfall. At that time, the snow cover in the Harz was slightly above the long-term average. Between March 6 and March 11, several low-pressure troughs moved northeast across Germany, initially bringing tropical warm air and, from March 10, maritime polar air again. This resulted in prolonged rainfall, particularly heavy from March 9 to March 11 (e.g., 96 mm in the Kahlen Asten area and 131 mm in the Oderbrück district of Sankt Andreasberg), which, combined with rapid snowmelt in the low mountain ranges – such as the Weserbergland and the Rhön – quickly caused the Weser and Aller tributaries from the low mountain ranges to swell. Favorable temperatures also caused almost complete snowmelt in the Harz. The water volumes flowing from the mountains exceeded the flood storage capacities of the Eder and Diemel dams; three reservoirs in the western Harz also overflowed. Although the flood peak of the Fulda preceded that of the Werra significantly, considerable flooding had already occurred in the Upper Weser. The flood peak passed the Weser gauge at Hannoversch Münden on March 12 and reached the gauges in Vlotho and Porta Westfalica on March 14. \n\nThe Middle Weser region was also affected by the flood situation, particularly downstream of the confluence with the Aller, which was also experiencing flooding. The immense inflow caused the Weser outflow to swell to critical levels, leading to the flooding of the Bruchwiesen near Thedinghausen. Initially, this did not provoke any press reports, as these uninhabited areas were often at least partially underwater. Between March 12 and March 14, low-pressure troughs moving from west to east brought further rain. Only from March 15, with significantly lower temperatures, did precipitation decrease. In some areas upstream of Bremen, however, the winter dikes soon came under threat, and on March 12, the Weser-Kurier reported for the first time on a potential flood in the Hanseatic city in a small, 18-line article titled \"Flood Wave Endangers Allotment Gardens.\" Subsequently, various allotment gardeners in the city began evacuating their small houses located in officially designated overflow areas. \n\nThe summer dike running along the left bank a few hundred meters upstream of the Weser Weir was designed for up to 1,300 m³ of water per second. Therefore, an overflow was expected on March 13, which would have resulted in the flooding of the allotment garden areas Hastedter Bulten and Fresenbulten behind it before the water could be channeled back into the river via the Werdersee and Kleine Weser flood channels as planned. Initially, this did not occur but was then rescheduled by experts for the early morning hours of March 14, though it again did not happen. Meanwhile, at the Weser Weir, due to the exceptionally high water level, there was hardly any noticeable difference in level between the Middle and Lower Weser gauges."

                "header": "The breakthrough",
                "content": "The first serious damage caused by the flood occurred in Bremen on the morning of March 15, when around 7 a.m. the riverside path below the so-called \"Weir Castle\" on the right bank near the weir began to collapse. The fire department deployed twelve emergency vehicles and secured already fallen trees with wire ropes—on the one hand to prevent obstruction of shipping if they fell into the river, and on the other hand to use them as a natural protective barrier for the shoreline. Four trees (poplars and beeches) had to be felled, and 18 others were tied down with steel cables. By noon, however, the water had washed away three meters of the riverbank. The backwater at the damaged weir caused the Weser River—already expected for two days—to overflow the summer dike, which was between 6.50 and 6.70 meters high, and partially erode it. After the westward-flowing floodwaters poured over fields, grasslands, and bird meadows, the designated Werdersee flood channel was filled, but most of the flood unexpectedly flowed further north, destroying several allotment garden areas. About 120 meters east of the Karl-Carstens Bridge, the water hit the summer dike (on the left bank of the Weser) from the land side, putting so much pressure on it that it gave way and broke around 3 p.m. Within an hour, this breach had multiplied in size. The water flowed back into the Weser more than four kilometers upstream from the point where the Werdersee would have had its regular inlet. In the process, about 100 allotment garden plots were washed into the Weser. The water police tried to stop and secure drifting huts, cars, and detached boats with small tugs, succeeding only partially and sometimes six kilometers further downstream. The river bypassed the weir in a short time and created a new, deep riverbed within a few hours. A large part of the Weser water now flowed around the weir on the left side. This new stream—from the overflowed summer dike on the Middle Weser through the overfilled area with allotments to the breach of the winter dike and the backflow into the Lower Weser—quickly became known as the \"New Weser.\" The water also caused severe damage to the banks of the intended flood channel. Particularly affected was the bend in the winter dike at the Karl-Carstens Bridge, as the water pressed directly against this protrusion. Around 6 p.m., an inflow of 1850 m³ per second with a rising trend was measured at the weir. The police closed the paths leading directly into the flooded area, including access roads to the Weser weir. In the evening, about 3.3 kilometers in a straight line from the main flood area, the road embankment separating the Werdersee from the Kleine Weser broke at the west end of the Werdersee, on the road leading from the Buntentor Deichschart in Bremen Neustadt to the \"Kuhhirten\" restaurant on Stadtwerder. This breach allowed better drainage of the Werdersee, which contributed only slightly to a quick improvement of the situation but led to the lake draining into the Kleine Weser after the flood peak. The next day, March 16, a new flood wave of 1900 m³ per second turned the already wide breach in the winter dike from the previous day into a powerful stream, washing 50 more plots into the river. The water flowed back into the Weser but was not carried away by its current; instead, it pressed against the riverbank on the opposite right side further downstream, causing significant damage there as well. Trees previously secured with steel cables were washed away. In some places, the riverbank eroded up to five meters. For example, the promenade between the fish ladder—where the force of the water broke apart concrete boxes—and the Jakobsberg sports field completely collapsed. The Hemelingen harbor facilities on the right bank of the Weser above the weir were also flooded knee-deep despite high sheet pile walls. Work had to be stopped in the Allerhafen. Water seeped out between the gates that sealed off the roads into the harbor. Sandbag barriers were erected near the access road to the A1 federal highway. While a Weser outflow of up to 2,650 m³ per second was reported from Verden in the afternoon, the promenade at the dike bend near the bridge slipped two-thirds of the way down by noon despite the efforts of the helpers who had since arrived. If the winter dike had broken here, large parts of the residential areas in Habenhausen would have been flooded. It was considered to dig a channel to absorb water immediately west of the bridge, but the work took too long. At 5 p.m., 200 helpers from the fire department, the Technical Relief Agency, and the riot police began building a relief dam from the damaged dike bend to the bridge pier. By 4 a.m. the next morning, March 17, this dam was completed, and the flood risk for Habenhausen was temporarily averted. On both March 15 and 16, the grotesque sight of the devastated allotment garden areas attracted thousands of onlookers who gathered on the Werder Bridge. Some even cheered individual huts being washed into the Weser. Snack stands were even set up on the slightly elevated pedestrian and bike path. The police had up to 120 officers on duty at times and struggled to keep the roadway clear for car traffic. The behavior of the \"disaster tourists\" was heavily criticized both during the flood and in retrospect. A total of about 550 allotment gardeners were affected by the flood, with the Hastedter Bulten e.V. being hit harder than the neighboring Fresenbulten e.V., where initially only about 40 huts were underwater. Around 6 a.m. on March 17, the road surface of Hannoversche Straße in Hemelingen partially collapsed, presumably due to underwashing from the flooded Allerhafen. By late afternoon, the water level at the Weser weir had dropped by six centimeters, and the feared risk of a weir breach was temporarily averted. Nevertheless, scouring up to twelve meters deep was observed in the now 150-meter-wide \"New Weser.\" In this area, in addition to the allotments, eight network stations of the municipal utilities (now swb AG) were destroyed. By the afternoon of March 18, the water level at the Weser weir had dropped from 7.04 to 6.95 meters, according to the Bremen Water Management Office. In the residential area located directly behind the softened dike on the southern edge of the flooded area, the fire department had to pump out basements on Habenhauser Dorfstraße and Holzdamm. As the peak of the disaster seemed to have passed, another small embankment above the Weser weir on the left bank—the so-called Boat Harbor Dike at the marina of the Upper Weser Sailing Club—broke at 2 a.m. on the night of March 19. In the following days, the sheet pile walls, a small peninsula, and the regatta tower there were washed away. Although club members built sandbag and stone barriers, they could only limit the erosion and not stop it. As a result, while the Weser weir was further relieved, the \"New Weser\" was additionally fed with several million cubic meters of water. This also intensified the breach back into the Weser east of the Werder Bridge again in the course of the morning. Around 1 p.m., another 15-meter-long and five-meter-deep section of the dike's soil was washed away about 30 meters east of the bridge. The additional water masses caused significant damage to the opposite Weser bank again after flowing back into the Weser, hitting it at almost a right angle. Although the Water Management Office tried to fill the holes in the embankment, they had little success. By 10 a.m., the Hastedter allotment garden area \"Im Suhrfelde\" had been evacuated as a precaution. Subsequently, both the Osterdeich between Stader Straße and the Weser weir and, due to concerns about structural stability, the Werder Bridge were closed to all traffic for several days. The \"New Weser\" continued to erode deeper into the ground of fields, allotment garden areas, and marshes hour by hour, so the flow velocity in the Hastedter Bulten area initially hardly changed. The Weser outflow dropped to 960 m³ per second by March 24, but the water receded only slowly from the flooded areas. It was not until April that a medium water flow was restored at the weir. Just under two months later, on June 9, another flood with a peak flow rate of 1100 m³ per second reached the Hanseatic city but remained largely without consequences."

                "content": "Five days after the first breach of the Weser into the overflow areas, securing and later cleanup operations began. On the morning of March 20, during one of the regular static measurements at the Werder Bridge, it was discovered that a pillar had twisted by one and a half centimeters. A seven-meter-deep scour had formed around it. However, authorities declared there was no danger. To support the pillar, normal stones as well as over 150 tetrapods and so-called delta stones were sunk at the site on the same day. Additionally, officials at the Water Management Office voted for the construction of a pontoon bridge over the water surface of the \"New Weser,\" following the interrupted Wehrstraße and to be built by the Bundeswehr. It was planned that starting March 23, trucks would transport stones over the bridge to fill the dike breach located above the weir. The dike closure work was to begin at the site of the Oberweser Sailing Club, where the \"New Weser\" originated with a width of 180 meters. Also on March 20, the Budget Committee of the Finance Deputation allocated 500,000 Deutsche Marks to be advanced for dike repairs. Meanwhile, the SPD local association in Hastedt called on the Senate and its own parliamentary group to restore the recreational and green areas in the district between the weir and Jakobsberg as quickly as possible. On March 22, 150 soldiers from the 160th Floating Bridge Battalion from Minden and the 11th Heavy Engineer Battalion from Dörverden began constructing a 500-meter-long steel mat road on a sand bed from the southern start of the Wehrstraße in the Habenhausen residential area directly toward the Middle Weser over the flooded meadows. A prior survey had revealed that the original plan—construction along the Wehrstraße—was not feasible. The current in that area would have been too strong for the bridge. Additionally, there were concerns that Bundeswehr vehicles might get stuck in the silt after the \"New Weser\" drained quickly.\n\nOther flood-damaged areas were also considered during rescue operations in those days. On March 22, work began to fill the heavily affected Wehrpromenade in Hastedt with slag and natural stones. To prevent further progression and expansion of the breach at the Werder Bridge, a 300-meter-long sheet pile wall was driven across the remaining Hastedter Bulten starting March 23. For this, 16 previously undamaged garden plots had to be sacrificed. Additionally, starting March 23, a Bundeswehr pontoon ferry transported machinery and filling material to the Oberweser Sailing Club. Initially, a small dam had to be pushed over a tidal channel to the Werraweg before actual dike construction could begin with the sinking of tetrapods. Work started on both sides of the breach to better control the current. The gaps were filled with hydraulic and slag stones and the resulting elevations were sealed with a mineral mixture. By March 24, the new dike had already grown to a length of 20 meters. To relieve the \"New Weser\" in the construction area from excessive water pressure, the weir was set to its lowest possible position to allow additional water to flow off via the \"Old Weser.\" In addition to the previous filling material, employees of the Water Management Office supplemented the construction site starting March 26 with approximately 1,000 three-meter-long special nylon sandbags maneuvered from a pontoon by cable. These were intended to help reduce the water's flow speed, as otherwise, the filling material of the new dike could be washed away. However, the bags were partially pushed away by the current, leading to a renewed focus on stones and tetrapods. On March 28 and 29, unexpected delays occurred in closing the dike. The pontoon's cable broke multiple times, and Hans-Dieter Bücken, head of the Bremen Water Management Office, stated that approximately 5,000 more special sandbags would likely be needed for the remaining 40 meters. The current of the \"New Weser\" remained very strong, and the water continued to erode the Hastedter Bulten with a slightly altered impact direction. Individual plots were still being destroyed during these days. Following the actual flood disaster, the Weser breach still caused injuries. A construction worker had to be treated in the hospital after his leg got caught between a freight cart and a tool rod on March 29. A major setback occurred at the breach site on April 4, when the current tore a 30-meter-wide hole in the nearly completed dike around 6:30 PM. Over 30,000 tons of natural stones had already been used, but the dike gave way at its weakest point, where no stones had yet been sunk due to transport reasons. In light of this development, Hans-Dieter Bücken urgently called for the construction of the originally planned pontoon bridge on April 5, as more material was needed and the ferry was not efficient enough. The conditions for bridge construction were now significantly better due to the changed current conditions compared to two weeks earlier. Consequently, engineers began building the bridge on the evening of April 6, completing it by noon on April 7. The bridge consisted of 100 hollow bodies and could support a weight of 50 tons. After completion, it was used continuously by trucks. In addition to filling the dike breach, cutter dredgers flushed sand from the Middle Weser in front of the newly emerging dam as a flanking measure. Starting April 8, approximately 20 tetrapods were to be launched daily. It was also estimated that several thousand tons of stones and fill material would still be needed. By the night of April 9, the dike breach was finally closed. In the following weeks, the area was continuously reinforced and sealed with a mineral mixture. The costs for this spatially limited measure amounted to 3.2 million Deutsche Marks. A total of 36,000 tons of fill stones, 3,000 tons of mineral mixture, 635 tetrapods, and over 4,000 sandbags were used. During tidal high water, which affects the Lower Weser up to the Weser weir, the \"New Weser\" still periodically turned into a river within the dike during the summer, as the incoming tide pushed into the erosion channel through the breach at the Werder Bridge. This situation remained unchanged throughout the summer. Initially, water construction experts had to address more pressing issues. For residents in the Werraweg area, a provisional path was built on the dike, and on April 9, Senior Building Officer Winfried Reiner from the Water and Shipping Office announced that the steep bank at Jakobsberg in Hastedt would be set back. It had been driven too far into the Weser after World War II. Starting in mid-April, engineers were to focus primarily on repairing the still defective weir structure. On April 9, Hans Dieter Rissland, head of the Hemelingen local office, demanded that the Hastedt promenade and green corridor below the weir be completely restored, as the industrialized district already had few recreational areas. In that area, a 40-meter-wide section had been washed away. Rissland accused federal and state authorities of indifference regarding the protection of green spaces. Meanwhile, several dredging ships on the Lower and Middle Weser cleared the river of numerous sandbanks and shallows that had formed due to sedimentation during the flood. At noon on April 14, ships with a draft of up to 2.20 meters were again allowed to navigate the Middle Weser, albeit with time restrictions: lock operations for upstream travel were only permitted two hours before and after tidal high water. Starting April 14, 600 tons of earth were moved to replace the broken dike breach path at the west end of the Werdersee with a provisional sand dam. The embankment was to be completed by Easter (April 19) to provide a temporary connection for pedestrians and cyclists. If the lake's water level rose again, the path connection was to be maintained via a pontoon bridge. Local politicians from Neustadt demanded that the Werdersee be temporarily dammed again to revive its recreational value and limit ecological damage. However, the lakebed would first need to be cleaned of debris. In May, the Bremen Dike Association on the left bank of the Weser, together with the Water Management Office, began repairing damage to the Habenhausen Winter Dike over a length of one kilometer. This included straightening the highly endangered dike bend at the foot of the Werder Bridge. The repaired dike section was one kilometer long. For these measures, 50,000 cubic meters of clay soil had to be moved, and 60,000 square meters of slope and foreland areas were reseeded. The Werdersee feeder at the foot of the dike was filled with 75,000 cubic meters of sand. Dietrich Harborth, spokesperson for the Building Senator, predicted at a Neustadt local council meeting on May 6 that the Werdersee would likely not be usable as a sports and recreational area by the public until 1983 at the earliest. He explained that the lake was completely silted up and might have to be manually shoveled out. Using machines to remove the sand would break the insulating clay soil layer. When news of another potential flood reached Bremen, the recently completed dike above the weir was hastily raised from five to six meters starting June 4, at a cost of 80,000 Deutsche Marks and using several thousand cubic meters of clay soil. The flood passed without incident, allowing work to focus on the western end of the disaster area. Starting June 11, plans from mid-April were implemented, and the Werdersee was dredged and cleaned—despite the sensitive clay soil—with heavy machinery. The silt removed was used to partially fill the erosion edges at the Hastedter Bulten. On July 2, Hans-Dieter Bücken informed the Obervieland local council about the progress of the plans. The work on the Habenhausen Winter Dike, which began in May, was nearing completion, with the slope flattened and the crown path widened. Repairs were expected to be finished by the end of August. Bücken noted that filling the Werdersee feeder was necessary because it ran too close to the dike foot and could soften it during high water. The summer dikes were also to be closed and supplemented. To better protect the riverbank, an additional clay wall was planned. SPD local politician Egon Hartwig expressed the view that the landscape altered by the \"New Weser\" could later be used as a recreational area. On August 10, the Building Deputation's awarding committee approved five construction and planning measures in the flood-damaged floodplain area. Among other things, the Wehrstraße was to be rebuilt for 670,000 Deutsche Marks, following its former course but at a higher elevation. The dam received three water passages. More importantly, the decision was made to close the backflow breach in the Hastedter Bulten. It was feared that otherwise, winter storm surges could again flood the meadows and remaining gardens. The gaping hole was to be sealed with a new six-meter-high dike, on which a two-meter-wide asphalt foot and bike path would be built. The cost was estimated at 2.5 million Deutsche Marks. The cost of restoring the revetment on the south bank of the lake over a length of one and a half kilometers was estimated at one million Deutsche Marks. On September 1, this construction site at the Werder Bridge was established. Initially, 25,000 tons of sand from the \"New Weser\" were piled up into a dam; the same amount was supplied by dredging below the Stephanibrücke. The sand core, the clay soil cover layer, and the dike crown were secured with a 60-centimeter-thick stone layer. The angle of the dike slope allowed for water overflow in an emergency. To reinforce and secure the new dike, a steel sheet pile wall was driven parallel to the Weser, connecting to the one from spring. It later disappeared into the revetment and was no longer visible. To maintain a connection between the \"New Weser\" and the river and thus ensure water exchange, workers installed a pipe with a gate through the dam. A flap at the Weser end of the pipe closed automatically under the pressure of incoming tide water, preventing a rise in water levels in the \"New Weser.\" On September 17, the breach was closed by bulldozers at 11:05 AM—186 days after its formation. The \"New Weser,\" now re-diked on both sides, had thus become a lake. By the end of the day, the dike was raised to a height of three meters. A total of 35,000 cubic meters of sand, 10,000 tons of fill stones, and an additional 10,000 cubic meters of clay soil were needed for this dike closure. By the end of October, repair and overhaul work on the Weser weir was also completed. The costs for restoring flood protection burdened Bremen with nine million Deutsche Marks in 1981 and the federal government with 13 million Deutsche Marks."

                "content": "As early as March 16, just one day after the dike breach, Bremen's mayor Hans Koschnick reminded that the affected allotment garden areas were known to have been designated as overflow areas and that the city could therefore not be legally held liable for compensation payments. However, he promised a sympathetic review of financial aid by the Senate, as the deficit of allotment gardens should not be increased. To also protect the city from demands for compensation, Building Senator Bernd Meyer critically noted on the same day: Johann Dreyer, chairman of the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends, then stated that the affected parties could not and would not bear the water damage alone. Despite the state's financial difficulties, the Senate must help the allotment gardeners—especially since the flooded area also served tens of thousands of Bremen residents as a recreational area. He emphasized that the damages were not insured but also admitted that every allotment gardener was aware of the risk of owning a hut in the designated overflow area. His association called for a fundraising campaign on March 18, as neither the association nor the affected individuals could even come close to covering the damages. The chairman of the opposition FDP parliamentary group, Horst-Jürgen Lahmann, also pointed out the following day that the allotment gardeners were aware of the risks of their location and therefore could not expect compensation from the state or city budget. He suggested a tax deferral as an alternative. Finance Senator Moritz Thape followed up on this idea on March 20, when he, with the approval of Federal Finance Minister Hans Matthöfer, decided on a regulation for tax relief for citizens affected by the flood. Among other things, tax debts could now be deferred upon request, advance payments on income, corporate, and trade taxes adjusted, and enforcement actions suspended. Also, on March 19, the self-help efforts of the allotment gardeners intensified. The Federal Association of German Garden Friends called on its ten state associations to organize fundraising campaigns, and independently, the Hamburg State Association of Garden Friends pledged its support and assistance. Additionally, the SPD local association in Hastedt announced plans to conduct a fundraising campaign among the population and businesspeople. On March 22, the Bremen Allotment Garden Association Werder decided at a general meeting that each member should donate 15 Deutsche Marks. The board intended to top up the total amount from the association's funds to 7,500 Deutsche Marks. The association also reserved five newly created plots for the flood victims. At the same time, the SPD parliamentary group made its own assessment of the situation on-site in the flood area. Parliamentary group chairman Klaus Wedemeier pointed out that the Weser was a federal waterway. Therefore, the regulation of damages could \"not essentially be a Bremen matter.\" On March 23, Building Senator Meyer offered the affected parties quick and unbureaucratic help from the state government. From now on, 100 new plots could be created at Park Wolfskuhle in the Kattenturm district, for which the Senate provided 1.2 million Deutsche Marks. By this time, around 10,000 Deutsche Marks had already been deposited into the allotment gardeners' donation account. A large automobile plant had sent a check for 1,000 Deutsche Marks and also offered \"quick and unconventional help.\" Another company provided the allotment gardeners with free fertilizers and peat products for a fresh start. Following urgent motions, the board of the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends received approval on March 28 at a general meeting in the Niederdeutsches Theater from the 276 delegates to allocate 100,000 Deutsche Marks from the association's assets. Additionally, a solidarity levy of ten Deutsche Marks per member was decided for the Hastedter Bulten association. By this time, 307,000 Deutsche Marks in donations had been collected. The following day, on March 29, the beneficiaries of the Hastedter Bulten allotment gardens held an extraordinary meeting with 500 members and relatives in the community hall on Drakenburger Straße. They called on the Senate not only to provide them with the replacement areas at Wolfskuhle but also to offer financial assistance. Furthermore, the authorities should fully restore the allotment garden area \"as soon as the water has receded.\" In a letter to Johann Dreyer on May 5, Meyer announced that a perspective for joint action had been found, which should also be perceived as fair by the flood-affected allotment gardeners: \"The clarification of the legal situation revealed that Bremen must provide appropriate compensation for the plots taken on the sheet pile wall route.\" Although there was no legal basis for compensation for private individuals affected by flood damage, the Senate had agreed to help the affected allotment gardeners—those who wanted to continue—financially and through services from the authorities. There should be no distinction between creating a new garden and taking over an existing free garden. \"Furthermore, I will advocate for a decision to be made shortly that allows for arbor loans of up to 7,000 Marks in these cases,\" Meyer continued. On the same day, recipient Dreyer estimated the damage at 1.2 million Deutsche Marks. He stated that the allotment gardeners themselves wanted to raise 300,000 from solidarity donations, and 30,000 Deutsche Marks had so far been donated by outsiders. The following day, on May 6, he increased his damage estimate to 1.5 million Deutsche Marks and stated that no politician had yet promised concrete help—although this contradicted the city's offers of assistance. However, Ludwig Meyer, chairman of the most severely affected Hastedter Bulten allotment garden association, expressed similar sentiments on the same day. He found it outrageous that Bremen politicians had not yet made any proposals to alleviate the hardship almost two months after the flood. However, the allotment gardeners were pleased with the spontaneous willingness to help shown by the population and associations from across the country. By the end of the first week of May, 65,000 Deutsche Marks in donations had already been collected. Additionally, various garden associations from the Hanseatic city provided over 17,000 Deutsche Marks, and the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends contributed 300,000. Its chairman Dreyer emphasized that the members felt abandoned. He rejected the argument that the allotment gardeners had always known how vulnerable their settlement area was. After a visit by the CDU parliamentary group to Obervieland, its chairman, opposition leader, and CDU state chairman Bernd Neumann, called on May 7 for unbureaucratic help for all allotment gardeners who had lost their plots in the Hastedter Bulten. He stated that they had informed themselves about the flood damages, which by now had to be estimated at between 40 and 50 million Deutsche Marks. Almost verbatim, SPD building deputies and members of the board of the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends reaffirmed their willingness to help the affected parties quickly and unbureaucratically after a joint discussion on the same day. At the same time, the Social Democratic deputies appealed to the allotment gardeners to make greater use of the replacement garden offer at Wolfskuhle. After all, arbor loans of up to 7,000 Deutsche Marks would be approved regardless of income. The operating company of the Stadthalle organized a benefit concert on May 13 as part of the ongoing relief efforts—officially called a \"Colorful Evening\"—in favor of the affected parties. All artists and catering businesses waived their fees or revenues. They expected 5,000 spectators in the Stadthalle and a corresponding revenue of about 100,000 Deutsche Marks. The nearly four-hour event under the motto \"Bremen Helps Bremen\" was moderated by Jo Hannes Müller and Manfred Ebel. Despite numerous media announcements and the lineup of well-known artists, the \"Colorful Evening\" met with very little interest. Only about 1,000 Bremen residents wanted to attend—it was even necessary to bring in nearly 300 Bundeswehr soldiers as \"gap fillers\" in the largely empty hall. The proceeds ultimately amounted to only 15,000 Deutsche Marks. On June 11, Building Consultant Götz Neuber cited a report already presented to the parliament during a public meeting of the Obervieland local council regarding damage regulation, stating that no culpable behavior by public authorities was evident. Therefore, the state could not cover direct flood damages and losses. The Senate could only pay compensation to those whose property was affected by flood control measures (farmers whose land was used for emergency access roads/allotment gardeners whose plots were used for driving sheet piles in front of the bridge pier foundation). Within this \"framework of what is legally permissible,\" the senatorial offices were striving to help the allotment gardeners and compensate for the damage caused. Economic Senator Karl Willms stated that he wanted to examine, in discussions with the Chamber of Agriculture, to what extent farmers could be compensated for yield losses. Subsequently, on June 23, a controversial debate took place in the parliament regarding a major inquiry by the CDU parliamentary group. Building Senator Bernd Meyer emphasized that only areas were flooded that \"by their natural function and under applicable law are intended to serve as flood discharge.\" This had also been considered when approving allotment garden huts on the Hastedter Bulten. Bremen could therefore hardly provide financial aid for the privately affected. However, he reiterated the plan to offer replacement allotment gardens in the Wolfskuhle area, grant arbor loans to the plot holders, enable tax relief, and provide unbureaucratic individual assistance. Peter Willers of the Bremen Green List criticized the confusion of responsibilities between the federal government and the states of Bremen and Lower Saxony. He attributed the flood significantly to human intervention in nature—such as the canalization of the Weser—and therefore argued that the allotment gardeners had a legal claim to compensation. In the summer, the allotment gardeners received several large donations. On June 26, Horst Reich, as the first chairman of the Arsten Leisure Community, presented Johann Dreyer with a check for 3,500 Deutsche Marks on the occasion of the association's tenth anniversary, collected by its 116 members. By this day, the donations received had totaled 220,000 Deutsche Marks. Wolfgang Schreck, head of the Daimler-Benz plant in Sebaldsbrück, handed Dreyer a check for 26,000 Deutsche Marks on July 22. About a year after the Weser breach, 570,000 Deutsche Marks had been donated by Bremen residents for the allotment gardeners. On August 20, several soldiers from the Heavy Engineer Battalion 11 from Dörverden visited the Weserwehr Allotment Garden Association. Its plots on the so-called \"Weir Island\" were completely surrounded by water during the flood but were not flooded due to their elevated location. Nevertheless, the association members were particularly dependent on the pontoon bridge and wanted to express their gratitude for the assistance provided with this meeting. The local council and local office of Obervieland supported this initiative \"because the deployment of the Bundeswehr soldiers is not taken for granted, but a committed thank you should be expressed.\""

                "content": "In order to make the largely devastated harbor of the Oberweser Sailing Club e. V. directly at the Weser bend usable again, the club chairman Helmut Steinmetz estimated a sum of one million Deutsche Marks on March 20. Only the boathouse and the winter storage halls remained undamaged. In the emergency, the camaraderie of the athletes came into play, and they were taken in as guest moorers by neighboring clubs. The Weser Sailing Club e. V., located directly west of the Weser Stadium, was somewhat less severely affected. By the end of April, 15 berths for larger dinghies, amounting to a quarter of the capacity, had become silted up and unusable after silt from the upstream floodplain had deposited behind the club's sheet pile wall. However, the club was prohibited from dredging its own harbor bed and dumping the sand into the Weser, chairman Helmut Barenborg stated at the end of April. Therefore, the Waterways and Shipping Office would have to address the problem using dredgers and barges. However, this request was rejected after just a few days. In a letter, the authority declined the removal of the sand, citing the small quantity. At the same time, it was pointed out that the club's application to flush the silt into the Weser at its own expense would be approved. Threatened in its financial existence, the Weser Sailing Club e. V. then turned to Sports Senator Henning Scherf for help. At the public meeting of the Obervieland district advisory council on June 11, Scherf promised to organize aid for the Oberweser Sailing Club, and indeed, on July 2, Hans-Dieter Bücken informed the advisory council that as part of the dike renovations, the bank revetment at the club would also be restored. A point of contention on its grounds was the construction of the harbor boundary. Before the flood, there had been a sheet pile wall as a barrier to the Weser. After the dike closure in early April, plans were made to limit the newly created harbor with a stone embankment. However, this would have significantly narrowed the harbor basin. No one was willing to bear the additional costs of 350,000 Deutsche Marks for the construction of a new sheet pile wall. After lengthy negotiations, the Senate ultimately decided to partially finance the solution favored by the club. Although the Oberweser Sailing Club still had to take on 100,000 Deutsche Marks in debt and cover the cost of building the 95-meter-long landing bridge opposite the sheet pile wall itself, it was thus saved. This was made possible not least thanks to donations amounting to 50,000 Deutsche Marks – including from SC Niedersachsen Werder and WV Woltmershausen. On May 9, 1982, the new harbor was inaugurated in the presence of numerous local politicians."

Although it significantly altered the landscape, it reflects only part of the threat at the time, as during those days, a storm surge over the Lower Weser reached the Hanseatic city simultaneously with the high water of the Upper and Middle Weser. An area of 70 hectares was flooded as a result of the Weser breakthrough, destroying 44 hectares of agricultural land, between 127 and 150 allotment houses on the eastern Stadtwerder were destroyed, causing damages amounting to approximately 56 million Deutsche Marks, and more than 1.5 million cubic meters of soil and sediments were washed into the Weser. Large parts of the affected area were subsequently covered by a layer of silt, mud, and sand up to one meter thick, contaminated with heavy metal deposits. Most of the swept-away allotments were not rebuilt. Their location—the breakthrough of the \"New Weser\" back into the river—is now dominated by wild growth. Particularly from a bird's-eye view, the course of the flood can still be well traced. The allotment area of Hastedter Bulten has been divided as a result. The water flow at the threshold from the Middle to the Lower Weser increased massively due to the Weser breakthrough and the forcibly created additional drainage possibility. For example, on March 20, only about 300 m³ per second flowed over the weir itself, while 1000 m³ per second sought the path of the \"New Weser.\" As a result, the water level of the Middle Weser upstream to Langwedel dropped dramatically in some places. There were short-term fears that it could drop to 60 to 80 centimeters. In combination with the sandbanks created by the flood, this was one of the main reasons for the nearly one-month closure of the corresponding Weser section to inland navigation."

                "content": "As early as 1981, the Senate commissioned the Franzius Institute for Hydraulic Engineering and Coastal Engineering at the University of Hanover to conduct hydraulic model tests on future flood diversion possibilities in the area of the Weser breakthrough. The large-scale model experiment began at the end of October and cost around 500,000 Deutsche Marks, 40 percent of which was covered by the federal government and 60 percent by the state of Bremen. Scientists from the University of Hanover and the Technical University of Braunschweig also dealt with this topic from mid-June. A commission of inquiry was established, which, however, merely concluded that the dike breaches resulted from a chain of unfortunate circumstances. On the one hand, the weir should have been repaired much earlier, and on the other hand, the flood protection measures taken in the 1950s—namely the construction of the flood channel—had failed. On April 21, 1983, apart from the previous repair and security work, work began to partially refill the deeply entrenched bed of the \"New Weser\" east of the Werder Bridge. Over the next few months, trucks transported around 125,000 cubic meters of earth to the area. This was excavation material from the Krimpelsee, located in the districts of Habenhausen and Kattenturm in Obervieland. This made it possible to fill about two-thirds of the erosion channel. The future of the \"New Weser\" remained unclear for several years. While the Bremen Water Management Office, for example, initially wanted to wait for the results of the Franzius Institute's report at the end of May 1983, conservation experts assumed that the habitat, which was interesting for flora and fauna, could be preserved regardless of flood protection strategies. The farmers affected by the Weser breakthrough, on the other hand, advocated refilling the \"New Weser\" to regain the lost arable land. Hermann Cordes, a professor of vegetation science and nature conservation at the University of Bremen, explained that remarkable plant species had established themselves relatively quickly on the edge of the water. These were mainly species that were once part of the typical flora of large glacial valleys. From an ornithological perspective, the shallow water zones on the Hastedter Bulten were also interesting, as they attracted numerous feeding guests, such as herons and sandpipers. Cordes stated that the area did not necessarily have to be designated as a nature reserve. It was also conceivable to preserve it as a remarkable landscape formation and recreational area without special protection status. Hans-Dieter Bücken, head of the Water Management Office, also said it was highly unlikely that the \"New Weser\" would have to be removed for flood protection reasons. However, Holger Schmidt, spokesman for the Obervieland local advisory board, pointed out that private property had been affected by the \"New Weser.\" Therefore, the farmers' desire to restore the original state was only too understandable. Furthermore, preserving the \"New Weser\" and constructing a nature conservation-friendly feeder system would be difficult to achieve together. During the Weser breakthrough in 1981, the Werdersee had proven almost ineffective in its intended protective function: while it protected the Neustadt from storm surges, it failed to secure Habenhausen from inland flooding of the Middle Weser. This fact, the already partially completed remodeling of the dikes, the \"New Weser,\" still perceived as a foreign body, and the question of how to deal with it ultimately led to the decision to redesign the area on a large scale. The holistic and nature-oriented concept aimed to prevent a similar catastrophe and ensure a more controlled flow of potential floods. The most visible measure was the extension of the still-dry Werdersee by 1.07 kilometers eastward beyond the Werder Bridge to protect the structure from uncontrolled undercutting and provide a faster catchment area for incoming inland floods. Deepening the lake near the bridge was also intended to keep flowing water away from the foundations. The eastern basin of the overflow area was raised over a large area to slow the flow velocity of overflowing Weser water. The Wehrstraße was restored to its old course and now passes the Werdersee directly at its eastern end. Here, the new feeder also flows into the lake, branching off from the left bank of the Weser above the Oberweser Sailing Club and ensuring the lake's supply of fresh water and circulation over 738 meters. The slightly winding canal features artificial rapids, was built far from any winter dike, is equipped with gates at two summer dike crossings, and was designed in a very nature-oriented manner as a compensatory measure for construction work in the port area. A significant intervention in the redesign was also the removal of the land bridge at the western end of the Werdersee, which separated it from the Kleine Weser. Since then, the Deichschartweg has crossed a bridge for pedestrians and cyclists, already demanded in 1981, under which the two bodies of water have been fully connected. From the Wehrstraße to the mouth of the Weser in the city center at the Bürgermeister-Smidt-Brücke, they now form a 5.7-kilometer-long continuous left-flowing watercourse. This allows potential floods from the Middle Weser to flow unimpeded into the Lower Weser. Finally, in 1987, the Werdersee was reflooded and has since served as one of the city's largest and most frequented recreational areas. The floodwaters of March 1981 eroded marsh soil and sand layers, relocated them, and created a patchwork of different soil types, offering diverse niches for plants with varying requirements. As Hermann Cordes had already predicted in 1983, this provided conservationists with the opportunity to preserve a small area of dynamic river activity within the city. The lake remaining in the floodplain was ecologically redesigned. Individual shore areas were flattened, and a buffer zone was established around the reservoir to prevent excessive eutrophication from surrounding agricultural land. Finally, on December 28, 1988, the lake and surrounding green spaces were designated as the 34.8-hectare \"New Weser\" nature reserve. The area is left to natural vegetation development, uninfluenced by humans and grazing livestock, and is scientifically monitored. Today, it hosts a diverse natural landscape with numerous habitats, such as reed beds, grasslands, tall herbaceous vegetation, flood meadows, still waters, near-natural floodplain shrubs, and trees, and is designated as a European bird area. As such, it is of great importance for both migratory and breeding birds. Numerous duck species and gray herons live there, and river terns nest on an artificial pontoon. The water body is fed by bank filtrate from the Weser and drains through discharge pipes into the Lower Weser. In summer, there is no stable temperature stratification. As early as June 11, 1981, Senior Building Officer Winfried Reiner from the Waterways and Shipping Office admitted at a public meeting of the Obervieland local advisory board that the Weser weir no longer met the DIN standards of the time. For new constructions, safety standards valid after 1981 required three independently controllable flow openings so that, in the event of damage to one weir, most of the floodwater could still flow through the other two. One of the most practical solutions for the new regulation of flood discharge in Habenhausen was therefore a modernization or new construction—in any case, an increase in the weir's capacity. Ultimately, a new Weser weir was built 180 meters downstream from the old location starting in 1989, with costs—together with the new lock system—amounting to approximately 287.5 million. It was put into operation on June 10, 1993. The new concept for inland flooding is designed for a Weser discharge of up to 4,200 cubic meters per second—this value corresponds to the flood event of February and March 1881 and has a recurrence interval of 600 years. Of this, 3,400 m³ is to flow through the weir, and the remaining 800 m³ through the so-called \"flood discharge channel,\" which consists of the Werdersee feeder, Werdersee, and Kleine Weser."

                "content": "The critical remarks following the Weser breakthrough of 1981 were essentially aimed at the flood control concept in place at the time—which many commentators retrospectively deemed inadequate—and at the behavior of political decision-makers. As early as March 16, Johann Dreyer, chairman of the Bremen State Association of Garden Friends, spoke out. He criticized that at the western end of the Werdersee, the dike path had been laid over a dam. Dreyer preferred a bridge with a small weir instead of just the existing narrow passage. However, the official admitted that he could only assess this technical problem as a layman. Wilhelm Mahrtens, who was the department head of the Northwest Waterways and Shipping Directorate and responsible for the Jade-Weser area, stated on March 21 that the \"delayed\" breach of the boat harbor dike was not due to water pressure from the Middle Weser but rather to backward erosion in the floodplain. This was mainly possible because loose farmland in the area of the undermined Wehrstraße had been converted into relatively solid pastures, which, according to him, should never have happened. The plowed soil had offered the water significantly better opportunities to dig deep. Furthermore, the flood was by no means a result of the failure of one of the weir structures. Mahrtens instead considered the overflow basins between Werraweg and Bullenwerder to be a serious planning error. Without them, the first flood wave would have taken its pre-programmed path through the flood channel to the Werdersee. Even the former director of river construction, Ludwig Plate, had criticized the establishment of allotment garden areas in the flood-prone region, Mahrtens said. Archive documents show that as early as 1928, officials had demanded that no plots be built in the water drainage area. On March 23, Building Senator Bernd Meyer responded with the words: \"There are far more important things to discuss now than questions of blame.\" At the extraordinary general meeting of the Hastedter Bulten Allotment Garden Association on March 29, several participants expressed disappointment and anger at the absence of the dike captain at the beginning of the events. The association's chairman, Ludwig Meyer, criticized the \"human incompetence\" and the inability to put the defective weir structure back into operation in time. As early as January, the authorities should have ensured a regulated outflow of the Upper Weser through the Werdersee channel as a compensatory measure. \"Hanoverian merchant stinginess\" had also prevented the dike path from being designed as a bridge. They had saved in the wrong place, as the summer dike at the Werder Bridge could only have broken and caused the violent backflow into the Weser because the water, which had already flowed further in the intended flood channel, was dammed back by the reinforced dike dam. Meyer concluded: \"The Werdersee has failed its first stress test.\" Anyone blaming the allotment gardeners must also hold accountable those who had issued building permits for the Hastedter Bulten. Presumably encouraged by Meyer in his opinion, Johann Dreyer brought up the topic again on May 6 at a meeting of the Neustadt local council. At the public meeting of the Obervieland local council on June 11, Meyer also renewed his criticism: the dike dam that additionally dammed up the floodwater and the winter dike bend at the Werder Bridge were the results of \"catastrophic planning errors.\" It was possible that a merely makeshift floodwater management system had been designed out of frugality. During the meeting, members of the Fresenbulten Allotment Garden Association also expressed concerns about being affected by future floods. The safety of their gardens was already at risk during the next summer storm surge. Due to the not even two-year-old commissioning of the barrages at Lesum, Hunte, and Ochtum, the Weser water could rise significantly higher than before and reach the garden sheds unimpeded through the (at the time of the meeting still not closed) damaged area at the Werder Bridge. However, Senior Building Officer Winfried Reiner from the Waterways and Shipping Office gave them little hope for a quick remedy. Restoring a dike that was secure against overflow during both Middle Weser floods and storm surges from the opposite direction would cost four million Deutsche Marks. This expenditure could only be justified once model tests had provided corresponding results. Furthermore, Reiner countered criticism of an allegedly delayed repair of the Weser weir. After the defect in November 1980, repairs had been started immediately but could only continue until Christmas, as winter and the high water level had made any further work on the weir impossible for safety reasons. He further speculated that the Bulten with the allotment garden areas would likely have been flooded even with a fully intact weir during the March flood."

From the 1800s, the idea of creating a new riverbed further away from the town was continuously raised; the most dangerous section was considered to be the winding bends between the Makó timber market and Kiszombor. In 1814, surveyor József Vertics prepared a regulation plan, but it was thwarted by the resistance of Károly Oexel, the landowner of Kiszombor, who refused to allow cuts through his lands. In 1815, royal navigation engineer Fábián Dániel Őry, sent to the site, proposed cutting through three bends near Makó. In 1816, a committee of experts led by royal commissioner Miklós Vay navigated the Maros. As a result of the inspection, the council of governors ordered the commencement of river regulation works in November of that year, but the digging of the new riverbed was halted due to a lack of financial resources. In 1820, Mihály Buday prepared a new regulation plan, but the town again did not receive financial support for its implementation. Teknyőkaparó, a well-known soothsayer and shaman in the Makó area, repeatedly predicted impending destruction. He foretold things like: \"You will see, soon the flood will come again. It will destroy people, animals, and trees.\" \"Such a great flood will come upon us that in Dry Street, Barna the fisherman will fish for catfish.\""

In the two weeks leading up to the flood, continuous efforts were made on bank protection works; nevertheless, on July 2, 1821, the river flooded Apátfalva and Csanád, then broke through towards the city at the Csipkés and Szugoly forests. At the same time, the embankment at Kakás broke; only a small portion of the surging flood could be collected by the Mikócsai and Margitai streams. Once they were filled, the flood washed away the Dália and Margitai bridges, inundated Belsőnyomás and the Jángor meadow. Although the above-mentioned outer areas were submerged, on this day, Makó's inner area was not yet under water. The river continued to rise, and at dawn on July 3, it broke through the Szentlőrinc embankment section. First, it flooded the vineyards, and within a few hours, the city itself. By 9 a.m., almost the entire city was underwater. After this, the city was surrounded by the Maros River for nearly a week; the hardships of the locals, stranded far from their lands, were alleviated by aid packages and donations sent by the residents of Hódmezővásárhely and Szeged, delivered to Makó by boats. The damage in the city and vineyards exceeded 270,000 forints. One-third of the residential houses were damaged or collapsed; 10,600 quintals of salt dissolved in the salt warehouses, exceeding half a year's salt needs for the area belonging to the Makó salt house district."

On March 6, despite defensive efforts, the icy flood broke through the dikes, and by the 8th, everything in the downtown area, except for the vicinity of the Franciscan church, was submerged. The water level rose until March 13, \"exceeding that of 1809 by five feet, flooding the entire inner city.\" \"The Captain's Office promptly announced house by house and also proclaimed with drumbeats that everyone should move their belongings and livestock to safe places, transport their fodder to the road near the upper hemp fields, and support their houses exposed to flooding with props. Millers, fishermen, and timber merchants were instructed to keep their barges, boats, and rafts ready for use in case of need.\" The flood lasted until March 14, a total of nine days. Some residents left the city, fleeing to higher areas such as Szenttamás, Szentgyörgymező, and cellars, press houses, or cemeteries in the surrounding hills. The Franciscan monastery provided shelter and care for 760 people. However, on March 12, water also entered the friars' church and monastery, forcing everyone to leave the significantly damaged building. The crypt remained underwater for days, the walls weakened, and the church, which had become life-threatening, could only be restored with the support of benefactors in 1857 to the extent that it could be visited by the faithful without danger."

In the early months of 1838, the Danube was completely covered with ice, and at that time, a lot of precipitation fell. In early March in Vienna, the ice was already floating. The first danger occurred in Vác, where despite the dike, a flood happened. This was repeated in Pest on March 13, but only part of the city was under water. Many believed that the flood could not spread. The river built a dike with ice just after the cities of Buda and Pest, but soldiers constantly fired cannons at the dike. This maneuver was unsuccessful. On the 14th, the level reached the record of 1775, and the rescue began. The residents partly took refuge in churches, which were very stable. On the contrary, the residential houses began to collapse. 50,000 people became homeless. On the 15th, the remaining dikes could no longer protect the houses, and a catastrophic flood occurred. The most notable helper was Baron Miklós Wesselényi, who saved people sitting on rooftops with a boat. (After the flood, all Hungarians added the epithet \"the flood sailor\" to Miklós Wesselényi. On that day, in some places, water depths of almost 3 meters were measured. In Pest, 2,281 houses were destroyed, 827 houses were damaged, and 1,146 houses remained untouched. In the opposite Buda, 204 houses were destroyed, 262 houses were damaged, and 2,023 houses remained untouched. In summary, in the Kingdom of Hungary, 10,000 houses were destroyed, and 4,000 houses were damaged. In total, 153 people died, of which 151 lived in Pest. When Franz Liszt learned about the flood, he immediately traveled to Vienna and organized 8 concerts, the proceeds of which helped the homeless. After the flood, new dikes were built, and the new houses became more stable. At that time, Újpest was founded. The next flood occurred in 1876, but the dikes protected the then-new city of Budapest (however, some damage occurred in Buda and Óbuda). During the Habsburg suppression, memorial plaques were placed about the water level at that time, but it is mentioned that the mentioned day, March 15, reminded Hungarians of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and not of the flood in 1838."

The water of the Sámson-Apátfalva channel was pushed back by the Maros for ten kilometers. On May 19, massive forces were mobilized in the city as the flood wave reached the Hungarian-Romanian border. The Maros peaked at 624 centimeters on May 20, 1970, at 10 p.m., while four kilometers from the city, a large group of water springs (seepage water on the protected side of the embankment) emerged with significant water flow. During the critical hours, full mobilization was ordered, and the city was defended by 56 engineers, 92 technicians, 178 water management professionals, the Makó fire department, 2,600 civilians, two military units, a Soviet military unit, an engineering battalion, as well as one law enforcement unit, a 120-member police unit, a civil defense unit, a workers' militia battalion, and a Red Cross battalion."

In the event of a dam break, the lowest-lying parts of the city would be covered by four meters of water, and the highest point by two meters. A total of 18,000 people were evacuated from the four settlements and surrounding farms in a single night, most of whom—16,000—were relocated to Hódmezővásárhely, but Szentes and several other villages also took in refugees. The operation, carried out with great organization and exemplary discipline, is an important milestone in the technical history of flood defense. This was the largest evacuation ever in Europe. The evacuees were able to return to their homes on July 3, after the immediate danger had passed."

The dikes of the Maros River were raised by an average of 1-1.5 meters, and their bases were widened. The flood marked a turning point: when the Maros returned to its bed, the government of the time saw it as an opportunity to develop the settlement – until then, the proximity of the Yugoslav border and the predominance of individual farming had excluded the city from regional development policies. The main square was reconstructed, and several large housing estates were established. Although delayed, industrial development also began, exclusively by establishing subsidiaries of national and county factories."

                "content": "The Heinrich flood of July 1965 occurred at a time when modern information technology and the methodology of hydrology and meteorology were in their infancy. There were no weather satellites, and the agencies responsible for water level and weather forecasting operated on a national level; international networking was only rudimentary. In particular, the runoff behavior of smaller rivers and streams during floods was completely unknown. In many places, there were no gauges on them. Sudden weather deteriorations or a sudden rise in water levels could sometimes only be detected when it was already too late to issue timely warnings to the population. Communication methods available included analog technologies such as telephone, teletype, and radio. Notices, daily newspapers, air raid sirens, and loudspeaker vehicles from the police and fire departments served as links between authorities and the population. Television and radio broadcasted only for a few hours a day in a limited capacity. Ongoing programs were often taken over by other German broadcasters and were very difficult to change or interrupt. Another recurring problem was the fact that, even in the 1960s, power supply in residential areas, both in rural and urban regions, was provided via overhead lines. If these were damaged by lightning or storms, it led to widespread, long-lasting power outages, further reducing the possibilities for remote communication. Under such conditions, the population could only be warned by loudspeaker vehicles from the police and fire departments or by officials going door to door. If power and telephone connections were interrupted and access routes were impassable, only rescue measures could be initiated."

                "content": "After an unusually wet and cold spring and summer, warm air masses from the subtropics moved northward in mid-July 1965, where they encountered cold Scandinavian air masses. This resulted in the formation of a so-called cold air drop on the rear side of the incoming warm air over northern France, which caused the very moist warm air to be completely enclosed by cold air. The warm air rose over the cold air, leading to severe thunderstorms with torrential rainfall. As early as the late evening hours of July 15, severe storms with torrential rains occurred in the Einbeck area, leading to widespread flooding. Due to the situation, the disaster management authorities of the then-district of Einbeck were forced to declare a disaster alarm at 8:45 PM, three-quarters of an hour after the storm began. In the following hours, the precipitation area, interspersed with severe thunderstorms, moved further west and also caused stormy rainfall in the area of the later disaster zone. In the morning hours of July 16, severe storms began in the Stadtoldendorf/Heinade/Mackensen area, which exacerbated the flood situation in the Ilme region. The storms moved westward with increasing intensity and reached the Paderborn/Warburg area around noon. Starting at 12:00 PM, under almost complete darkness, torrential and stormy rainfall lasting about two hours began over the Paderborn plateau, the Warburg Börde, and the Waldeck tableland, in an area spatially bounded in the west by the Rothaar Mountains and in the east by the Egge Mountains and Reinhardswald. These rains slowly weakened as they moved eastward, reaching the Einbeck/Göttingen area in the evening hours. During the storm, rainfall amounts of well over 100 mm were recorded at weather stations in an area between Paderborn in the north, Brilon in the southwest, and Warburg and Hofgeismar in the east, as well as in the Kassel and Fritzlar areas, most of which fell within a two-hour period. In the area between Paderborn and Höxter in the north, and Warburg and Hofgeismar in the south, about 200 mm of rainfall was recorded between July 14 and July 17 over 72 hours, and in Dalheim, even well over 200 mm in 24 hours. Short-term maximum rainfall intensities of up to 4.5 mm/minute were recorded. Further severe storms worsened the situation again in the following days, particularly in the Kassel and Hannoversch Münden areas."

                "content": "In the catchment areas of the Diemel and Twiste as well as the Lippe and Altenau, the rainfall could no longer be absorbed by the already saturated soils; similarly, the underground cave systems typical of karst landscapes were already so filled beforehand that a catastrophic runoff event occurred. Due to the surface runoff and the erupting karst springs in the area of the Paderborn plateau, as well as in the Stadtoldendorf and Heinade areas in the Holzminden district, water levels in rivers and streams reached previously unobserved heights within a very short time. The erupting karst springs on the flanks of the box valleys typical of karst landscapes and the high intensity of the rainfall caused large amounts of water to not only enter the towns from the rivers but also flow directly down the mountain slopes as flash floods. In unfavorable slope areas, numerous landslides occurred. Damming structures, such as road embankments, undersized bridges and culverts, as well as field walls and even pasture fences that trapped the abundant debris, temporarily led to even higher water levels. Due to the extreme rainfall on water-saturated soil, water levels in streams and rivers in the rainfall area rose rapidly. Depending on the size of the catchment area, the possibility of flooding, and the capacity of the riverbed, maximum water levels were reached shortly after the midday storms subsided. At the Schmittwasser, a discharge of 15.4 m³/s was recorded on July 16 at 1:57 PM, and at the Ellerbach, a discharge of 20.6 m³/s was recorded at 2:38 PM. In Paderborn, the discharge at the Pader gauge on July 16 was 47.3 m³/s, which corresponds to almost ten times the average discharge. At the Pader spring, it took until the end of August for the values to normalize. This extreme discharge led to widespread flooding in the urban area. The Altenau brought a flood wave to the Lippe, which caused flooding up to the Lippe's mouth. The flow rate at the Lippe gauges was ten times the five-year average. The Diemel gauge at its mouth in Bad Karlshafen rose by 5 meters within a few hours on the morning of July 17. In Eberschütz, which was passed by the flood peak during the night of July 16 to 17, the Diemel swelled so quickly that the town was flooded within half an hour. At the gauge on the upper course of the Diemel in Westheim near Marsberg, the flow rate on July 16 was 225 cubic meters per second (average 1954/2006: 5.26 m³/s). In Helmarshausen near Bad Karlshafen on the lower course of the Diemel, the flow rate was even 820 cubic meters per second, while the normal rate here is about 10.4 m³/s. The Diemel flood wave caused a water level in the Weser at Bad Karlshafen that exceeded the summer flood of 1956. However, the flood peak of the Weser flattened significantly on its course to the Weser weir in Bremen-Hastedt and, unlike the July flood of 1956, was no longer noticeable at the tidal gauges of the Weser below Bremen. At the gauges of the Fulda and Eder, the situation remained calm despite the extreme rainfall, as the water level of the Edersee had already been lowered a few days earlier. This allowed the partially drained reservoir to absorb and store 29 million cubic meters of water flowing in from the heavy rainfall in the upper Eder catchment area."

These included the small dams built at the many water mills of the time, as well as outdated road bridges and culverts that were not designed for such loads and were heavily damaged or destroyed. In the settlements, river cross-sections were very constricted by installations and therefore unable to accommodate the water masses coming from the upper reaches. The large amount of debris carried along, which clogged culverts and bridges, proved to be very dangerous. Particularly vulnerable were the stone arch or vaulted bridges common in the region at the time, 40 of which in the catchment area of the Alme, Altenau, and Lippe rivers alone were destroyed or so severely damaged that they had to be replaced by new constructions. Flood waves several meters high caused by dam breaches destroyed or severely damaged numerous massive bridges, interrupting regional road connections as well as power and telephone lines. High flood waves were also caused by field walls built across the valley cross-section or near the banks, which could not withstand the high water pressure over time. The collapse of the medieval monastery wall in Dalheim, the breach of a road embankment near Wrexen, the breach of the medieval city wall at the Esse culvert in Grebenstein, and the collapse of a wall damming up the floodwaters in Etteln led to flood waves several meters high, which appeared completely unexpectedly to the population and rushed down the valley. Severe damage occurred on agricultural land where floodplain meadows had been converted into arable land, as well as in areas where river straightening had been carried out as part of land improvement measures. In these areas, there was not only severe damage to the banks but also, as at the Dalbach below Oesdorf near Westheim, a return of the river course to its old riverbed. Riverbanks with only individual trees were also severely damaged. There were significant bank collapses, severe scouring, and deepening of the riverbeds of rivers and streams. In Paderborn County alone, 24 road bridges were destroyed. Above damming road embankments, large deposits of silt and gravel occurred. Gravel deposits also caused severe damage to agricultural land, where they were deposited by sheet floods and flash floods rushing down from the slopes of box valleys. These floods had a similar character, depending on the slope gradient, to those observed in alpine torrents. The German geologist Ecke von Zezschwitz, who was in the disaster area during the storm, observed a sheet flood about 1.5 km long and several hundred meters wide near Elisenhof as an eyewitness. On the flanks of box valleys, there were large landslides in many places, and in unfavorable locations, entire old forest stands slid down, such as in the forest areas near Blankenrode. In some areas, the special geological structure of the karst as well as the slope and soil conditions led to the formation of badlands. In the Minstal, located about 1.5 km southeast of Etteln between Donnerberg and Ettlerberg, a 1.5 km long and up to 5 m deep erosion channel reaching into the rock was washed out. Not only loose material but also large rock material was washed out of this channel. A cloudburst, during which more than 150 mm of rain fell in a very short time, is assumed to be the cause."

                "content": "In the catchment area of the Diemel River and its tributaries, the towns of Wrexen, Grebenstein, Helmarshausen, Trendelburg, and Bad Karlshafen were particularly severely affected. A major damage hotspot was in Wrexen. After 156 mm of rainfall fell in Rhoden within a very short time and immediately flowed into the Rhodener Bach, which drains into the Diemel, the water masses accumulated in front of the bridge located in the road embankment of Federal Highway 252, which was not designed for such a flood, to such a height that the embankment was flooded. The excessively steep outer slope gave way under the water masses now flooding the embankment in a broad front, and the embankment broke over a length of 80 meters. As a result of the embankment breach, the previously dammed water masses suddenly poured into the areas below the embankment. On their way downstream, three water mills and their associated buildings were hit by a four-meter-high flood wave and severely damaged or destroyed. On the way to the Diemel, the massive road bridge along Ramser Straße in Wrexen was completely washed away. Numerous houses and businesses were severely damaged, and building debris and agricultural equipment were transported over long distances. In Wrexen, a woman lost her life during the storm. She was in a house that was hit by a mudslide. The bridge over the Diemel along Federal Highway 7 near Warburg was destroyed by the flood. This interrupted an important regional road connection between Kassel and Paderborn at the time. At the Immenhausen train station on the Kassel–Warburg railway line, hundreds of passengers of the Deutsche Bundesbahn were stranded because the line was no longer passable due to the flooding of the station in Grebenstein. In Grebenstein, the Esse, a tributary of the Diemel, carried logs from a sawmill upstream of the town to the city wall. The river, initially dammed by the driftwood consisting of long logs, then caused part of the city wall at the Esse inlet at the Hilte to collapse, after which the water suddenly poured into the city center in the form of a meter-high flood wave, causing severe damage along with the carried logs. In Helmarshausen, over 100 people were trapped by the rapidly rising water of the Diemel. They could only be rescued with the help of helicopters. During the rescue, there was one fatality. Trendelburg and Bad Karlshafen also suffered severe damage from flooding. The entire historic old town of Bad Karlshafen was flooded several meters high. On the Weser River, the water level of the 1956 flood was exceeded. Debris and animal carcasses were transported as far as Hameln."

The focus was on the Paderborn plateau with the towns of Etteln and Borchen on the Altenau (Alme). In Etteln, 200 people were trapped by rapidly rising floodwaters, and 7 residents were killed, including 4 children, after a field wall that initially held back the Altenau's water from the town gave way under the pressure of the water masses. After the wall broke, a two-meter-high flood wave suddenly poured into the village. Four people, including three children, were swept out of a residential house and drowned. Many of Etteln's residents, who were in life-threatening situations, could only be rescued from their homes by helicopters or heavy military equipment. In Schloss Neuhaus, two people lost their lives in the floods. Here, the bridge over the Alme on Federal Highway 64 was destroyed after it became clogged with debris. The Alme flood wave, as well as rainfall that could no longer be managed by the stormwater drainage system, flooded parts of downtown Paderborn, where some streets were flooded up to a meter high. Severe damage occurred in the flooded houses in the city center and in shops and businesses. Severe flood damage also occurred in Schwaney, where the entire town center was flooded, and in Lipperode. In Lippstadt, the city center was flooded up to a meter high. Numerous important buildings, including the two hospitals, were no longer accessible even to emergency services. Flooding also occurred further along the Lippe in the Hamm, Haltern am See, and Dorsten areas; however, no residential areas were affected here, as the Lippe dikes controlled by the responsible authorities withstood the floodwaters."

                "content": "Due to the catastrophic rainfall during the midday and early afternoon hours and the rapidly swelling rivers and streams, the responsible authorities declared a disaster alert. This led to the deployment of thousands of civilian and military helpers. In addition to local fire departments, the Red Cross, church aid services, the police, and the Technical Relief Agency, soldiers of the Bundeswehr as well as the British Rhine Army stationed in Detmold, Hameln, and the Senne were deployed. While in Lower Saxony, the disaster plans established and practiced by emergency forces after the storm disasters of August 1955 and June 1961 in the Leine region, as well as the July floods of 1956 on the Leine, Aller, and Weser, were effective, and more severe impacts were prevented through a centrally coordinated deployment of rescue forces, the disaster response in the affected regions of North Rhine-Westphalia proved inadequate. During the cleanup operations, the then North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Minister Willi Weyer had to admit serious deficiencies in disaster protection. Due to a lack of coordination among the emergency forces, there were initially significant problems with rescue operations. For instance, Bundeswehr units stationed in the region, as well as Belgian, Dutch, and British military units, acted on their own initiative after the responsible local commanders recognized the existence of a catastrophic emergency. Other rescue units, such as the fire department, THW, and Red Cross, were unaware of these operations. The complete collapse of the telecommunications network and the lack of radios proved particularly devastating. The responsible district authorities had to send messengers in some areas to warn municipal administrations in the endangered regions. These messengers sometimes only reached the affected areas after hours. In the particularly hard-hit municipality of Etteln, the technical operations command set up by the local administration had only a single radio device. Numerous destroyed bridges and local, regional, and interregional roads impassable even for high-wheeled emergency vehicles caused significant problems. As a result, long detours were sometimes necessary to reach the operation sites. The inadequate equipment of the rescue teams prevented the rescue of those trapped in many places. At the Kuhlemühle Küting near Ossendorf, the Bundeswehr's attempt to rescue eight people and several children from buildings surrounded by water using a helicopter not designed for this situation failed. In Etteln, a woman and a child fell from a rescue rope provisionally attached to the helicopter. In some cases, people were stranded on the roofs of their houses in the flooded area for 17 hours. A woman also lost her life during a failed helicopter rescue operation on the Diemel. Below the Wrexer Pond between Wrexen and Rhoden, where a catastrophic flood wave occurred after a road dam broke, a dramatic rescue operation took place. The people trapped in the mill building threatened with collapse, including two children, could not be rescued from the air because the helicopters in use were only equipped with ropes that were too short, making it impossible to reach those trapped. Wrexen resident Louiza Ramus, who rescued the trapped individuals from the building together with sport diver Horst Richard Platt, was honored for her selfless act in December 1965 with the Hessian Rescue Medal by the then Hessian Prime Minister Georg August Zinn."

                "content": "Just a few weeks after the disaster, extensive investigations into the course of events and the damage caused by the flooding were initiated. Noteworthy among these are the studies by geologist and then-director of the Geological State Office of North Rhine-Westphalia in Krefeld, Herbert Karrenberg, \"Rainfall Intensity and Erosion in the Karst Area of Paderborn during the Storm of July 16, 1965,\"[12] the work of geologist Ecke von Zezschwitz, \"Soil and Vegetation Influences on Flooding and Erosion during the Storm of July 16, 1965, in the Paderborn Plateau Area\" (1967),[15] as well as the report \"Flood-Related Landscape Damage in the Altenau Catchment Area and Its Tributaries\"[41] by Walter Mrass, with contributions from Wilhelm Lohmeyer and Gerhard Olschowy, commissioned by the then Federal Institute for Vegetation Science, Nature Conservation, and Landscape Management on behalf of the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association. Of particular importance is the work of Ecke von Zezschwitz,[15] as he experienced the storm firsthand as an eyewitness and, as an experienced geologist, made detailed observations that could be incorporated into both his work and that of Herbert Karrenberg. The investigation by Mrass, Lohmeyer, and Olschowy focused primarily on the damage that occurred outside settlement areas. They found that river sections with banks covered by dense tree stands, preferably ash and willow, withstood even this extreme flood without significant damage. This applied to both flat banks and erosion-prone steep banks. The ash tree proved to be optimal in this regard, as its dense root system stabilized the bank, preventing the water masses from washing away loose material. In some areas, according to Mrass, Lohmeyer, and Olschowy, shrub stands, especially nettles, also proved to be highly effective bank protection during the Heinrichs Flood. The nettles' extensive root systems stabilized the bank substrate, and the plants laid down with the strong current on the riverbank, thereby preventing erosion.[24] Sections with sparse tree cover along the banks or those without any tree cover experienced the most severe damage, according to Mrass, Lohmeyer, and Olschowy. This was particularly true for river sections where grassland use extended right up to the bank. A destroyed grass cover due to livestock trampling in watering areas significantly promoted bank destruction. Fencing structures also had extremely negative effects. Dam-like structures, such as bridges and culverts with insufficient flow capacity, encouraged bank collapses and the formation of deep scour holes below the structures. River sections with individual trees or small groups of trees also suffered severe damage. Unlike banks with continuous tree cover, the formation of vortices here intensified the impact of the highly turbulent floodwaters. This led to the formation of deep scour holes, and the trees standing on the banks were uprooted, subsequently becoming driftwood that created obstacles in front of culverts and bridges. This driftwood not only worsened the situation in front of dam-like structures such as bridges and culverts, but also pasture fences developed a flood-retaining effect due to the accumulating driftwood.[24]"

                "content": "As a result of the July floods in 1965, flood protection and the system of water associations in the affected areas were reorganized. To prevent similar events, significant interventions were made in river systems. These included, among other measures, the straightening, deepening, and canalization of riverbeds, widening of bridge cross-sections, and the creation of large retention basins, such as in the catchment area of the Alme near Husen-Dalheim and its tributary, the Sauer near Sudheim and Ebbinghausen. The Aabach dam near Bad Wünnenberg, which had been planned before World War II, was also tailored to the needs of flood protection and implemented, creating additional storage capacity in the Aabach catchment area during floods. In the jurisdiction of the Upper Lippe Water Association, founded in 1971, 23 flood retention basins were constructed. In the Diemel catchment area, there were also significant interventions, including river straightening and the construction of dikes. On the Twiste, the Twistesee, which had been planned in the first half of the 20th century but repeatedly abandoned, was built to improve flood protection. In Lower Saxony, measures had already been initiated following the storm disaster of August 1955, the floods on the Weser, Aller, and Leine in July 1956, the June floods in southern Hanover, and the 1962 flood disaster on the North Sea coast. These included, among other things, an improvement in disaster protection, a fundamental reform of the partially centuries-old water association laws, and especially the development of the Aller-Leine-Oker Plan. At the time of the Heinrich flood, planning procedures for the construction of flood protection structures in Lower Saxony were already in full swing."

However, in many places, flood markers attached to buildings still commemorate the event. Commemorative events are regularly held on the anniversaries of the disaster. On these anniversaries, the regional press and regional magazines of Westdeutscher Rundfunk also recall the disaster. For example, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Heinrichs Flood, Osnabrück Bishop Franz-Josef Bode visited Etteln, where he witnessed the disaster as a youth. For the 50th anniversary, a stele was erected in Etteln in July 2015."

The peak of the catastrophic escalation of a flood situation occurred in the Weser catchment areas from February 2 to 11, 1946. After a winter frost period, thawing began on January 28, 1946. Neither the frost-induced impermeability of the soils in January 1946 nor the snowmelt in the Harz Mountains, which began at the end of January 1946, played as significant a role in the catastrophic extent of the February flood as in previous extreme floods in the Hanover area. The catastrophe was caused by unusually heavy rainfall in early February 1946. As a result, on February 10, 1946, the city of Hanover experienced its largest flood disaster to date. The rivers Leine and Ihme, as well as the Maschsee, overflowed their banks. Contributing to this was the natural narrowing of the 900-meter-wide flow area of the Ihme at Waterlooplatz to 400 meters at the Glocksee Bridge. Additionally, around 700,000 gasoline cans from a British depot at Schützenplatz Hanover were washed up there, further blocking the water flow under the bridges. Consequently, 1,666 hectares were flooded up to a height of 3 meters, including the districts of Altstadt, Calenberger Neustadt, Südstadt, Linden, and Ricklingen. The water level of the Leine in Herrenhausen rose to 6.44 meters, a level that has not been reached since. This water level is considered a centennial flood for the city of Hanover. The flood claimed three lives and caused significant property damage. After the flood, historical documents from the Hanover City Archive were removed uncontrollably and burned during the winter, resulting in the loss of 80% of the 19th-century city history records."

Initially multi-day rainfalls repeatedly developed in the past into torrential downpours, with precipitation totals in the higher elevations reaching extreme values, sometimes approaching the limits of physical possibility. The flood of 1927 (as well as the floods of 1897, 1957, and 2002) was attributed to a Vb weather pattern. In this situation, low-pressure systems brought extremely moist and warm air with high precipitation potential along the trajectory from the Mediterranean region to the Polish Baltic coast, causing strong and prolonged steady rain (area-wide precipitation). Since Saxony was located on the western flank of this low, the air masses were pushed from the north against the Ore Mountains. The stowage effect led to the precipitation of the saturated air masses on the northern side. At the same time, the decreasing movement speed caused a longer stationary presence over the mountains. This resulted in the complete precipitation of convective rainfall with torrential showers and thunderstorms."

While the source areas of the Müglitz and Gottleuba are located at about 700 to 800 meters altitude, their mouths into the Elbe, reached after 34 and 49 kilometers of flow respectively, are at about 110 meters altitude. Thus, the rivers exhibit a steep terrain gradient with significant elevation differences in a confined space. As a result, the river valleys have cut steeply and narrowly into the bedrock. Natural retention areas, such as larger valley expansions, are scarcely present or have been utilized for settlement and transportation development since the mid-19th century. The steep gradient and insufficient retention areas cause high flow velocities of the waters, especially during floods."

                "header": "Forest poverty",
                "content": "The river basins of Gottleuba and Müglitz belonged to the dense forest area that stretched from the edge of the Elbe valley expansion to the ridge areas and the Bohemian southern slope of the Ore Mountains before their settlement. At the time of the 1927 flood, however, the source areas of both rivers were considered to be sparsely forested. Even today, only about 45% (202 square kilometers) of the approximately 460 square kilometer catchment areas of Müglitz and Gottleuba are forested. The comparatively low forest proportion for a low mountain range is, among other things, a consequence of the settlement that began in the 12th century. With land acquisition, the forest landscape in the Eastern Ore Mountains was transformed within a few decades into a cultural landscape characterized by villages, towns, fields, and transport routes. This settlement activity led to extensive clearings, as the firewood consumption alone in the 16th century was estimated at at least 20 cubic meters per house per year. Additionally, wood was consumed for the construction of houses (timber framing, shingles, etc.) and the production of everyday goods (household furnishings). Larger amounts of wood were also needed for reconstruction after fires. The total wood consumption of a settler in the mid-16th century amounted to over 500 kilograms per year. The settlement-related strain on the forest was further intensified by iron ore mining in the region around Berggießhübel and Bad Gottleuba and tin ore mining in Altenberg and Zinnwald. Both mining itself and smelting were existentially dependent on wood as a building material or on charcoal as an energy source. For example, the production of just one kilogram of iron required the use of 29 to 46 kilograms of wood. The required amounts of wood were largely harvested without regard for the regenerative capacity of the forests, leading to their depletion and devastation. During its peak period (16th century), iron ore mining and smelting in the central Gottleuba area alone consumed one to two square kilometers of forest per year. The fact is that forests can mitigate the effects of floods. They have an intensive and extensive root system, which is highly effective in conducting and storing water. While about 65 to 70 liters of water per square meter can seep into a flat forest floor, only 20 liters can do so on an equally sized pasture area. Another portion of the precipitation can be retained by the canopy and evaporates back from there. In the coniferous forests predominant in the Eastern Ore Mountains, about 30 to 40% of the precipitation does not even reach the ground, as it is converted into water vapor by the trees and released back into the atmosphere."

At Mückenberg (Komáří hůrka) and Sattelberg (Špičák u Krásného Lesa), it split and poured down in the Müglitz and Gottleuba valleys. Part of this thunderstorm was held back by the Schneeberg (Děčínský Sněžník) and later poured into the source areas of the Müglitz and Gottleuba. Between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m., the thunderstorm settled in the Sattelberg area after having struck the town of Schönwald. The Gottleuba, which normally has a width of three meters, widened to 80 to 100 meters. Flood waves up to six meters high rushed into the valleys. The amount of water that fell was estimated at 120 to 150 liters per square meter. In Schönwald (Krásný Les), 209 millimeters of precipitation fell. Further precise data is not known, as several weather stations of the state weather service fell victim to the storm."

However, the exact number of people who lost their lives in the devastating storm cannot be precisely determined to this day, as the number of guests, day-trippers, and workers present in the area (including those working on laying a telephone line towards Vienna) remains uncertain. Therefore, the literature varies in estimating the number of victims between 146 and 158 deaths. It seems realistic to assume about 160 victims. The numbers provided below include all flood victims who lost their lives in the municipalities, i.e., both residents and guests (spa guests, workers, etc.)."

Overall, the flood destroyed about 20 kilometers of track, and the remaining sections were largely impassable due to undermining, silting, and the deposition of debris. Of the 28 railway bridges between Köttewitz and Lauenstein, 24 collapsed. As a result, one of the main traffic routes in the Eastern Ore Mountains was out of service for an extended period. Rail replacement bus services via Dippoldiswalde were set up for passenger transport. Freight transport was also shifted to the road (as far as this was possible and still necessary given the destroyed industrial sites). The reconstruction of the line resembled a new construction due to the financial and material effort. The first section between Heidenau and Köttewitz was already reopened on July 26, with the remaining sections following step by step: August 15: Lauenstein–Altenberg, August 18: Köttewitz–Weesenstein, October 3: Weesenstein–Häselich, October 13: Häselich–Oberschlottwitz, November 15: Oberschlottwitz–Glashütte. The line was not fully operational again until December 1. The reopening of the valley's \"lifeline\" was enthusiastically celebrated in the neighboring communities. At the same time, the severe destruction and the extensive reconstruction efforts initiated considerations for converting the narrow-gauge line to standard gauge. The goal of these considerations was to raise the route by up to 15 meters to reduce future flood damage."

Individual flood waves are said to have reached heights of up to six meters. The evening train of the Müglitztalbahn, standing at the station, was completely surrounded by the floodwaters, with some carriages swept away up to 300 meters. Two of the swept-away carriages destroyed the Kurfürst-Moritz Bridge over the Müglitz, built in 1545, which had withstood the severe flood of July 31, 1897.

On May 29, 1613, severe thunderstorms broke out over parts of Thuringia, causing many rivers to rise by several meters within a few hours. The affected area stretched from Mühlhausen, Langensalza, and Artern in the north to Stadtilm and Ichtershausen in the south, from Erfurt and Gotha in the west to Naumburg in the east. The storm disaster is described as the \"Thuringian Flood\" in the chronicles of many localities:  \nIn Kahla, there were several fatalities, and large parts of Jena were flooded. In Zottelstedt near Apolda, the water level of the Ilm rose by 6 to 8 meters, almost completely destroying the village in the riverside area. In Apolda itself, eight houses were swept away, and 24 animals drowned. In Weimar, 44 houses were destroyed in the flood disaster, 23 houses in Bad Berka, and 125 houses in Erfurt. In Mattstedt, the water level of the Ilm rose by 6 meters and flooded the entire lower village. The disaster resulted in the further development of the village shifting to higher ground. In Bad Sulza, the saline, which had been built on the Ilm only a few years earlier, fell victim to the flood but was rebuilt in the same location. The total number of fatalities is reported to be 2,261 people. Historical flood events like the Thuringian Flood play an important role as hydrological-meteorological extreme situations in current research on this topic. See also: Century Flood"

Between July 14 and 16, 1956, nearly 50 hours of continuous heavy rain occurred in the mountainous regions of Lower Saxony, Thuringia, Hesse, and East Westphalia, accompanied by storm-like downpours in the lowlands. These rains fell on water-saturated ground, causing the precipitation to flow exclusively on the surface. Within a very short time, water levels rose dramatically, leading to widespread flooding. By July 16, 1956, the water level of the Weser in Minden had risen to 4.50 m above the average water level, halting navigation on the Upper and Middle Weser. In the city of Braunschweig, 681 hectares of grassland and farmland in the Wabe and Mittelriede areas were flooded by July 17. In the lignite mine of Retterode near Hessisch Lichtenau (Werra-Meißner district), massive water ingress occurred on July 15 due to the rainfall, partially flooding the underground facilities. The situation worsened in the Aller and Leine rivers and the Hessian highlands after further storm-like rains on July 18 and 19, 1956, leading to dike breaches, riverbed shifts, and uncontrolled overflow of the Eder Dam. The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen narrowly avoided a severe flood disaster only because the floodwaters were diverted via the then-existing overflow routes near Thedinghausen into the Ochtum lowlands west of the city, which, however, caused flooding in the municipalities of Stuhr and Hasbergen. By July 25, over 240,000 hectares were flooded due to the flooding of the Middle Weser. The estimated property damage amounted to over 170 million DM. On July 17, 1956, the Porta Westfalica gauge of the state WSA recorded an extreme value of 1180 m³/s and 629 cm, which nearly approached the century flood of the Weser on February 10, 1946, with 2300 m³/s and 790 cm."

On the evening of March 21 into the night of March 22, drifting ice due to ice flow formed an ice barrier near the flood channel at Küstrin-Kietz. Ice jams also formed north of Reitwein. These quickly dammed large amounts of water. In the early morning of March 22, 1947, at 1 a.m., the Oder dike near Reitwein was finally flooded. The dike crest was overtopped by water in two places over a length of more than 100 meters. Sections of the dike crest, approximately 300 meters wide and one meter deep, were quickly destroyed. The flood even reached Bad Freienwalde (Oder), several kilometers away from the river, including the main post office building in the city center, where a memorial stone is located today. More than 20,000 people were left homeless at the time. The head of the disaster protection department of the Märkisch-Oderland district administration also confirmed an ultimately unsuccessful deployment of Red Army bombers against the dangerous ice jams on the Oder in 1947. On the morning of March 22, eight bombs were dropped by Soviet aircraft, followed by four more in the afternoon. Further bombings were carried out on March 23. However, none of the measures achieved the desired result. The jam finally dissolved on March 24 at around 9 p.m."

It was followed by extreme floods in February and March 1784 in Central Europe, which are regarded as one of the greatest natural disasters of the early modern period in this region. The cause is attributed to particularly sulfur-rich or especially intense and ash-rich volcanic eruptions that occurred in Iceland."

In addition, there were clouds of gas and ash. The extensive amounts of emitted sulfur dioxide reacted with the water droplets in the clouds to form sulfurous acid and sulfuric acid. In addition to an estimated 122 million tons of sulfur dioxide, 15 million tons of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and 7 million tons of hydrogen chloride (HCl) were released. This had devastating consequences for the entire country: due to poisoning, livestock perished (→ fluorosis); and the resulting famine caused an estimated 9,350 people to die in the following years, more than one-fifth of Iceland's population. In Western Europe, the eruption also had an impact; the toxic aerosol cloud spread across the entire continent, particularly over the British Isles, and was perceived as high-altitude haze or \"dry fog.\" Records report that the smog lingered in the sky for weeks. Symptoms of poisoning manifested as shortness of breath, making it difficult, for example, for farmers to continue their fieldwork. On the British Isles alone, around 25,000 people died. The eruption of Mount Asama in Japan in 1783 had only a minor impact on climate changes compared to the eruption of the Laki craters."

Scientists assume that in 1784 the average temperature was one degree Celsius lower than usual. The frost period lasted a total of 13 weeks in Mainfranken. The cold began in December 1783, and almost all bodies of water in Central Europe subsequently froze over. The Great Belt in Denmark was already so heavily frozen that it could be crossed with sleds and wagons. Around December 26/27, 1783, there was a brief improvement in temperatures, but by the end of the year, they dropped sharply again. This extreme cold lasted until mid-January 1784. From mid-January to February 21/22, this cold phase was repeatedly interrupted by short periods of slightly milder temperatures. During this time, snow also fell frequently. The winter was very snowy from December to February. For example, from December 24, 1783, to February 21, 29 snowfall events were observed in Mannheim, some of which lasted for days. In some regions, the snow grew to more than 150 centimeters in height, with around 45 centimeters of snow falling in the Rhine-Neckar region on December 27 and 28, 1783. February also brought a lot of snow and ice. All of Europe was hit by a cold wave from late December 1783 to January, stretching from the Black Sea to the Atlantic. In France, it was so cold that wolves appeared in villages to prey on livestock. The snow masses in the winter of 1783/84 restricted agricultural production in various German states to such an extent that severe supply shortages occurred. To bridge these shortages, the respective governments intervened with controls. In Königsberg, so much grain was stored that there was not enough space for it. In Darmstadt, several people froze to death. On the Saxon Elbe, ice floes formed, becoming increasingly dense, and on the night of December 28 to 29, the river in front of the Augustus Bridge in Dresden froze over. In Frankfurt am Main, bread and wood collections were organized in January 1784 due to the persistent severe cold and to support the poor. A total of 14,752 loaves of bread, each weighing six pounds, were distributed. In Speyer, modest celebrations were held on the frozen Rhine to use the proceeds from this charity event to combat poverty. Out of fear of possible ice drift, public prayers were ordered in Cologne and Bamberg. In Stuttgart, a balloon was launched in the courtyard of the military academy, illuminated and equipped with a small fireworks display. The proceeds from this event were used to buy wood for the city's poor, as prices for it were very high. On January 7, temperatures of minus 17.5 degrees Réaumur (−21.9 °C) were measured in Leipzig at seven in the morning. In Weida in Vogtland, the Réaumur thermometer also showed minus 21 degrees Réaumur (−26.3 °C) on the morning of January 7. However, even in the cold January of 1784, warmer periods were recorded in Saxony. From January 15 to 17, thawing weather prevailed, with a maximum temperature of +5 °C. This meteorological pattern, alternating between colder and warmer periods, continued in February 1784 and led to an accumulation of ice on the Elbe, as the cold January period over Germany was followed by a cold period until February 21/22, repeatedly interrupted by short warmer phases. The severe frost lasted until the end of February 1784, causing the ice masses on the Elbe to pile up to 110 centimeters. In addition, significant snowfall in the Electorate made the supply situation more difficult."

                "content": "Around February 23, a sudden influx of warm air caused the enormous snow masses that had accumulated during the winter to melt. This warm air was triggered by a blocking high-pressure system over Eastern Europe, which resulted in a southward-oriented circulation in Central Europe. The change in the large-scale weather pattern brought warm air masses from western and southern directions to Mainfranken and large parts of Europe. The winter had previously been characterized for an unusually long time by the large-scale weather patterns of High Central Europe and East, which had brought very cold air masses from northern and eastern directions. The warm air influx was marked by widespread precipitation due to large-scale overrunning movements. Due to the rapid and intense warming, accompanied by heavy rainfall, the ice in Germany's rivers broke and jammed in the last days of February 1784. Because of the enormous meltwater masses, ice jams, and heavy precipitation, water levels began to rise very quickly. Ice movement occurred simultaneously on all major main and tributary rivers. Compounding the situation was the fact that, during intermittent thawing phases, several layers of ice had pushed over one another and then refrozen. Shortly after this warm air influx, cold weather returned due to another change in the large-scale weather pattern, precipitation decreased, and water levels quickly dropped. The blocking high had dissolved, and the previous weather patterns were able to reestablish themselves. Cold air once again flowed into Central Europe from northern and eastern directions."

The flood devastated entire valleys, countless bridges were destroyed. It is also referred to as the \"century ice drift\" or \"ice flood\" or \"winter flood of 1784.\" Cologne was struck by the worst flood ever recorded. During the mentioned temperature jump, the Rhine was completely frozen, while the snowmelt and breaking ice caused a record level of 13.55 meters – for comparison, the normal level is 3.48 meters. The floods, carrying heavy ice floes, devastated large parts of the riverside buildings and destroyed all ships. Individual buildings, including fortifications, collapsed due to the ice floes. 65 deaths were reported. In Beuel, only very few buildings with stone foundations survived the ice chunks; all half-timbered houses were washed away. The old Bergisch town of Mülheim am Rhein, located on the right bank of the Rhine and now a district of Cologne, was completely destroyed. Even the trees of the famous walnut grove on the Namedyer Werth (a peninsula since 1857) near Andernach were literally cut off above their roots by the ice floes. The Andernach Old Crane escaped the disaster thanks to the basalt icebreaker built upstream. On the Moselle, the ice flood of 1784 remains the highest winter flood documented by flood marks to this day. In Trier, the water's peak level was observed on February 28, 1784. The water reached as far as the Pferdemarkt and Jakobsgasse. A plaque on a building at the Großer Markt in Saarlouis marks the water level of the Saar from 1784. The Neckar caused the largest flood in historical times in Heidelberg. The effects of the flood were exacerbated by the ice drift. In addition to the Old Bridge, 39 buildings were destroyed and 290 damaged. Similarly affected were other communities, especially Neckarhausen, along the Neckar's further course toward its mouth, including downtown Mannheim. After Seckenheim, the river partially followed the path of an old branch and flooded Neckarau, several kilometers away. The natural disaster prompted the construction of the first flood protection measures between Edingen and Mannheim. Among other things, under the rule of Elector Karl Friedrich of Baden, a sandstone icebreaker was installed on the Neckar bank in Edingen. The Main also experienced extreme flooding. This flood, second only to the Magdalene Flood of 1342, is classified as a 300- to 500-year event in the central Main region. The flood mark on the Würzburg town hall portal shows a maximum level of 173.83 m above sea level for this flood, which is 94 cm above the 1845 value. Compared to the flood recorded at the gauge in 1845, the 1784 flood had a level of 928 centimeters, with a discharge of 2600 m³/s. In Bamberg, the largest flood of all time destroyed the riverside buildings in the Mühlenviertel. The bridges were also heavily damaged. In particular, the Seesbrücke, completed in 1756 and now the Kettenbrücke, with its baroque features, was destroyed by ice floes and uprooted tree trunks. In Marktbreit, the then half-timbered loading crane was destroyed and later replaced by a stone structure with an icebreaker. At the end of February / beginning of March 1784, one of the most severe spring floods ever recorded occurred in the Bohemian and Saxon Elbe Valley. The Elbe, frozen for weeks, broke up within a very short time, rising by up to 32 cm per hour and reaching a level of 8.57 m in Dresden on March 1 (discharge 5200 m³/s). This was the highest level since 1655. Throughout the Elbe Valley, towns and villages were extensively flooded. In Dresden, the water stood one meter high in the courtyard of the Zwinger. The destructive power of the flood was particularly great due to the force of the debris and ice floes it carried. In Wegstädtl in Bohemia, the Gothic church collapsed. In Dresden and Meissen, the Elbe bridges were severely damaged. While livestock could not be saved in many places, the number of fatalities was relatively low given the severity of the flood. In Meissen, nine people lost their lives in the floods. The old postal road between Meissen and Dresden was relocated to flood-safe areas due to the flood. Although the Elbe returned to its original course on March 6, cleanup efforts were difficult as the onset of frost covered the flooded houses and areas with a layer of ice. The flood levels of that time were only surpassed in many places during the Elbe flood of 1845. Further downstream on the Elbe, in the Duchy of Magdeburg between Aken and Sandau, extreme floods with dike breaches occurred only in early April, including between Cracau and Prester near Magdeburg. The area around the confluence of the Saale and Elbe near Calbe (Saale) and the section north of the town of Jerichow to Sandau, all areas also particularly affected by the 2013 flood, were also severely hit. After the Lahn destroyed a bridge with a water pipeline in Weilburg, the first chain bridge on the European continent was built here after reconstruction. Smaller rivers such as the Glan in Ulmet (Palatinate) or the Paar in Baar-Ebenhausen (Bavaria) also experienced flooding."

The first phase, which occurred on 11/4, was characterized by heavy thunderstorms and mainly affected the southernmost sectors of Piedmont and the Ligurian territory: the maximum rainfall intensity was reached during the night between November 4 and 5 with hourly values exceeding 35 mm/hour and a peak of 55 mm/hour around midnight (Cairo Montenotte, Acqui Terme). Subsequently, on the 5th (second phase), the rainfall extended to the areas of Astigiano and Cuneese. In many locations in the Tanaro, Bormida, and Belbo basins, rainfall heights of over 200 mm in 24 hours were exceeded. The maximum cumulative rainfall over two days occurred in Levice (CN) with 293.8 mm; the maximum for one day was also recorded in Levice with 264.6 mm (Luino, 1999). In the third phase of the event, the most intense rainfall affected the pre-Alpine belt between the Pellice Valley and the Sesia Valley in the afternoon and evening of the 5th, subsiding in the morning of the 6th. On the 6th, the rainfall practically ceased in the southern part of the region, while it continued in the central-northern part, with modest hourly intensity but still significant daily totals."

The first river overflowed in the early hours of the morning on November 1st, affecting the area around the old Araceli church and Viale Rumor, along with the nearby Querini Park, which was turned into a swamp. Consequently, the provincial headquarters of the Red Cross and UNICEF located in Contrà Torretti were evacuated. At 7:30 AM, the Bacchiglione also overflowed at Ponte degli Angeli, blocking northern and eastern access to the historic center; however, the Olympic Theatre was spared thanks to the activation of three water pumps (in addition to the two always present in the famous Palladian structure). Water also invaded Contrà San Pietro, Corso Padova, Via IV Novembre, the riverside Contrà areas of San Biagio/San Marco, and the Stadio Menti area. The Bacchiglione also overflowed at the Viale Diaz bridge, blocking traffic on one of the main arteries of the outer ring road, flooding the San Paolo district (sports hall, swimming pools, athletics field) and the Carmini area, along with the northern part of Corso Fogazzaro. The Santa Bertilla area (customs and fruit and vegetable market) was also flooded, as was the Viale Trento area. In the afternoon, the Retrone overflowed in the S. Agostino district, and all ground-floor residents of the Debba district were evacuated. Traffic in the city was paralyzed: the A4 motorway was closed, as were the South Bypass and all railway lines starting from or passing through the city. Urban bus lines operated by AIM were also affected, with some routes canceled due to the inability to transit through city streets. Twenty-one electrical cabins were submerged, leaving over 3,000 users without power. These are the flood data: As soon as the waters receded, Mayor Achille Variati issued a call for volunteers who could help the city and its residents return to normalcy. The following day, more than 200 people showed up to assist, first helping AIM Valore Ambiente workers clean the streets and then aiding citizens. Within four days, the number of volunteers reached 2,483, who, in three daily shifts meeting in Piazza Matteotti, were dispatched to the city's most critical points. On November 3rd, almost all schools reopened, and the usual Thursday city market was confirmed; on the same day, Guido Bertolaso arrived in Vicenza, declared a state of emergency, and brought the army to the city. Bertolaso's visit was followed by those of Silvio Berlusconi and Umberto Bossi on November 9th. On November 11th, the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, arrived in the Berico capital at the explicit invitation of the mayor. The President first visited Piazza Matteotti (where volunteers awaited him and presented him with a personalized vest) and then the town hall. \"You have shown that it is not true that you wait for state aid, that you do not ask but act, that you have understood how, in a moment like this, cleaning is a noble job. No one was ashamed to get their hands dirty in the mud and use a broom\" (Giorgio Napolitano in his speech to volunteers during his visit to the city on November 11th). Following the flood, 46 Vicenza artists (including Los Locos, Stefano Centomo, and Lost) came together in the style of \"Artists United for Abruzzo,\" recording the song \"Un cuore grande così,\" with proceeds going to flood victims."

On November 16, 2010 (given the critical situation just 15 days earlier), volunteers were called in to prepare sandbags, and precautionary evacuation of some schools affected by flooding on November 1 was carried out. On December 24, 2010, given the imminent Christmas holidays, the municipality turned to the American army stationed at the Ederle barracks, as it did on March 16, 2011 (when the unification of Italy was being celebrated). Fortunately, all alarms subsided fairly quickly, with flooding limited to the areas \"historically\" more vulnerable."

The Frassine also overflowed, causing numerous floods. On the night between November 1 and 2, 2010, in Veggiano, the Tesina Padovano broke the right bank before its confluence with the Bacchiglione, just after the Fratta pump station, flooding much of the municipal territory during the day of November 2, 2010.\n\nThe force of the waters flattened 40 meters of the embankment (which was only partially patched up days later with cyclopean boulders brought in by helicopter), forcing 880 people to evacuate. Also in the territory of the municipality of Veggiano, the Tesinella (which originates from the municipality of Grisignano di Zocco) overflowed, and numerous springs opened along the banks of other tributaries (Ceresone). For over a week, water levels exceeded one and a half meters, with peaks over two meters in the lowest areas. One of the areas most affected by the flood was the Bassa Padovana, where 22% of the territory was submerged. The embankment of the Frassine river suddenly gave way in the locality of Prà di Botte (a collapse of 150 meters of embankment wall), flooding the municipal territories of Megliadino San Fidenzio, Saletto, Montagnana, Ospedaletto Euganeo, and Este; 23 million cubic meters of water poured into the area. A couple of hours after the disaster, another drainage channel, the Vampadore, overflowed, flooding Megliadino San Vitale and Casale di Scodosia. Subsequently, the municipalities of Carceri and Vighizzolo d'Este were also invaded by the waters of the Brancaglia canal (albeit to a much lesser extent).\n\nThe landfill present in Este was immediately closed as water managed to enter the facilities. During the flood period, a vast lake several kilometers long and wide could be observed from the Euganean Hills. On November 17 and 18, there were new floods, particularly of the Bacchiglione river, which especially flooded Bovolenta. The same occurred on December 25, again in Bovolenta."

In Monteforte, 6 million cubic meters of water and mud poured in, causing damage to 759 private properties, 146 businesses, and 25 farms. On the morning of November 1, 2010, the water from the Tramigna stream, a tributary of the Alpone, broke its embankment and began overflowing in Soave. Part of the area within the medieval walls and the entire external area extending to the middle school were flooded by water, which flowed back from the Alpone along the Tramigna. With this flood in Soave, approximately 600 private properties, 120 businesses, and 22 farms suffered damage.

Due to the overflow of various watercourses, flooding and extensive damage occurred in the countryside between the basins of the Ombrone, Albegna, Fiora, Nestore, and Paglia rivers and in the town of Albinia in the municipality of Orbetello, a hamlet that was completely flooded with about 150 displaced people due to the overflow of the Albegna River, out of a total of about 700 displaced people throughout the province. Cultural heritage was also affected, with the collapse of a Renaissance bastion and a section of the walls of Magliano in Toscana. Numerous infrastructures were rendered unusable, including State Road 1 Via Aurelia and the Tyrrhenian Railway (reopened in the afternoon of November 16, 2012), which were interrupted near Albinia, as well as numerous local roads, following the severe damage caused by the disastrous effects of the bad weather. In Grosseto, a record flood of the Ombrone River was recorded, remaining in the floodplain for three days, lasting longer than the one in 1966 but without major damage in the city, despite panic in the hamlet of Istia d'Ombrone where water reached some houses near the bridge; the hamlets of Rispescia and Alberese were also isolated for two days. At the provincial level, the event is comparable to the Grosseto flood of November 4, 1966, with the difference that the 2012 event hit the southern sector of the province harder, while the 1966 event caused the most damage along the Ombrone Valley in the central-northern part of the provincial territory. Intense rainfall also affected the Monte Amiata area, including the Sienese side, as well as a vast area of Lazio and Umbria straddling the Lazio Maremma, Tuscia, and Orvietano, where exceptional floods occurred, with consequent overflows of some right tributaries of the Tiber, including the Nestore, with 1000 m³/sec at Marsciano, submerged by the overflow with extensive damage, and especially the Paglia, its main right tributary, which with an extraordinary flood of 1,500 m³/sec completely submerged the lower part of the municipality of Orvieto, causing extensive damage."

                "content": "On November 10, 2012, a complex system of low pressure and disturbances formed between the Atlantic Ocean and Spain, moving rapidly towards the western Mediterranean and beginning to affect northwestern Italy, causing rather heavy rainfall in Liguria during the second part of the day.  \nAt the same time, an extensive high-pressure field was strengthening over the Balkans, acting as a block for the eastward movement of the disturbances, thereby reinforcing the warm and humid sirocco wind drawn towards Italy by the low pressure present in the western Mediterranean. Consequently, in the evening, the disturbance intensified, fueled by the sirocco, generating strong thunderstorms during the night hours between Versilia, Garfagnana, Lunigiana, and the Pisa coastline, reaching the city of Livorno, all areas where rainfall accumulations between 100 and 250 millimeters were recorded within a few hours.  \nBetween the morning and early afternoon of Sunday, November 11, 2012, cooler and drier air arriving from the Atlantic managed to invade Tuscany for a few hours, bringing a temporary and relative improvement in the weather; however, the blocking action of the high pressure over the Balkans, opposing the now deep low pressure in the western Mediterranean, sustained a strong and humid sirocco wind between the Strait of Sicily and the southern Tyrrhenian Sea.  \nBy late afternoon, the sirocco once again reached southern Tuscany through a warm front that—due to the relative positions of low and high pressures near Italy and the presence of a jet stream at high altitude aligned with the front—remained stationary in the area for about 30 hours.  \nAlong the warm front, a very intense mesoscale linear convective system developed, a particularly extensive thunderstorm that brought heavy rainfall and downpours between the Maremma region of Grosseto, parts of the provinces of Siena and Viterbo, and the Tyrrhenian Umbria. The thunderstorm continuously regenerated its structure from 6:00 PM on Sunday, November 11, until 11:00 PM on Monday, November 12, 2012, when the bad weather rapidly subsided. The improvement in weather was facilitated by the formation of a new low-pressure system over Morocco, which redirected the humid air driven by the sirocco away from Tuscany and towards Sardinia (initially) and the Balearic Islands (later)."

Below are some rainfall records registered during the flood event by some stations of the Regional Hydrological Service of Tuscany: In addition to the aforementioned daily rainfall records, following the precipitation of November 12, 2012, various rain gauges in the affected area recorded new monthly total rainfall records with 18 days still available to further increase the record: among them are the hydrological stations of Abbadia San Salvatore and Piancastagnaio in the province of Siena, on the slope of Mount Amiata from which the Paglia River valley originates, as well as the already mentioned rain gauges of Orbetello-San Donato, Scansano-Pomonte, and Roccalbegna-Usi, and the hydrological stations of Magliano in Toscana-Poggio Perotto, Manciano, Marsiliana, Manciano-Capanne, Pitigliano in the Tufo Area, and Santa Fiora on the Grosseto side of Amiata; other stations nonetheless reached precipitation accumulations between November 1 and 12, 2012, close to the historical monthly record, which could be surpassed by the end of the month in case of further rainfall. We also report the data recorded in the immediate vicinity of the Grosseto borders, for example, the two meteorological stations related to Acquapendente (VT) managed by MeteoAquesio. The first, located at an altitude of 340 meters above sea level (locality Fornace), recorded an accumulation of 256 mm in just under 40 hours. The second, located at an altitude of 734 meters above sea level (located within the Monte Rufeno Nature Reserve), recorded a rainfall accumulation of 465 mm in just under 40 hours. This latter station was, for several hours, right in the most active part of the trajectory of the self-regenerating thunderstorm, recording a record accumulation accompanied by very high rain rate values."

                "content": "On the morning of June 19, 1996, the sky over Versilia was clear; however, that day, a clash of cold air from northern Italy with warm, humid air from the coast was taking place over the crests of the Apuan Alps, causing a very rapid meteorological evolution. This favored the formation of an apparently modest storm cell, 12 km high and about half as wide, heavily loaded with precipitation (convective storm). Extremely violent downpours broke out starting early in the morning over the Apuan Alps, affecting the entire upper basin of the Serra and Vezza streams (the latter converging into a single watercourse at Seravezza, the Versilia) on the western watershed, and the entire upper basin of the Turrite di Gallicano stream on the eastern watershed. The precipitation also affected part of the Camaiore river basin. All this occurred while only a few drops of rain fell on the Versilia plain. In a short time, the extraordinary rainfall (with peaks of over 150 mm in an hour in the upper Vezza basin) caused several landslides, and the watercourses swelled rapidly. Following a brief pause in late morning, the rains resumed even more intensely throughout the day, from noon until early afternoon, culminating in a deluge. Torrential rains shook the mountains and ravines near the village of Cardoso, where various smaller streams converge near the settlement to form the Vezza stream. Meanwhile, in the plain, no one could remotely predict what was happening: in the Pietrasanta area, near the short stretch of plain of the Versilia river, only 5–10 mm of rain had fallen. Civil protection was activated, taking care around 2:00 PM to check the rainfall values in the Apuan Alps, discovering that one of the hydrometers at the Pomezzana center in the upper Vezza valley recorded a record cumulative rainfall value, with 440 mm in just 8 hours and a peak of 157 mm in one hour. Fearing the possibility of a sudden flood wave, river levels were immediately checked, especially the Versilia, which, upon initial observation, appeared to be deceptively receding after the large flood wave of the morning."

                "header": "1:00 PM: the disaster",
                "content": "Around 1:00 PM in the upper valley, the Vezza stream (upper section of the Versilia River) began its devastating course downstream near the center of Cardoso: here, according to eyewitnesses, numerous booms were first heard coming from the mountains, followed by repeated waves of water, mud, and debris up to 4-5 meters high coming from the ravines of the streams converging near the village, which was almost completely overwhelmed and destroyed. The sudden speed and violence of the event were explained by the fact that, since the morning, the heavy rains, combined with the drought that had afflicted the area for months, had further weakened the already unstable slopes of the Apuan Alps, causing massive landslides of earth, debris, and logs that had temporarily blocked all the valleys of the watercourses upstream of Cardoso, which feed the Vezza stream. Several ephemeral water basins were thus created, which all collapsed together in the early afternoon under the relentless rainfall, resulting in a catastrophic flood wave. Among the people who lost their lives was young Alessio Ricci, after whom the elementary school on Via Pontenuovo in Pietrasanta has been named since 2020: he was only 8 years old when he was swept away by the river's flood. After devastating Cardoso, the flood continued along the Vezza stream, first hitting the center of Ponte Stazzemese (where it reached the second floor of houses, partially collapsing an entire hotel) and then reaching Ruosina, where it submerged the entire village, almost completely erasing the valley floor road. Additional water inflows reached the Vezza from every lateral valley, further feeding its flood. Around 3:00 PM, the flood furiously reached the town of Seravezza, which was largely submerged by 2-3 meters of water; in this section, the Vezza stream also received the floodwaters of its main tributary, the Serra stream, from the right. From this confluence onward, it changed its name to the \"Versilia River\" and continued impetuously, overflowing with debris downstream, literally overwhelming the only hydrometer along its river course (which recorded a value of 4.50 meters above zero). Therefore, no other data on the maximum flood height is known, except for the peak flow rate, estimated after the event at about 571 m³/s, an absolutely exceptional and uncontainable value for a modest river like the Versilia. After Seravezza, the Versilia River overtopped and destroyed all the bridges near the centers of Ripa, Corvaia, and Vallecchia, leaving its valley section and finding an outlet in the Versilia plain. In this section, the river (channeled and diverted into an artificial bed centuries ago, which flows near Cinquale di Montignoso) literally overflowed near the locality of San Bartolomeo in Pietrasanta due to the overtopping and subsequent collapse of a large section of its left bank, creating a new course to the south, following the ancient path of its old riverbed, thus causing extensive flooding of the entire western portion of the municipality of Pietrasanta up to the Marina di Pietrasanta, Forte dei Marmi, and part of the municipality of Montignoso. Meanwhile, the tragedy also struck the eastern side of the Apuan Alps in Garfagnana: in the upper valley of the Turrite stream, the center of Fornovolasco was literally devastated by the flood of the watercourse. Further downstream, however, the damage was minimal thanks to the presence of an artificial lake on the watercourse, which, being completely empty for maintenance, was able to absorb much of the flood's force, saving the downstream center of Gallicano. Around 6:00 PM, the rain gauges in Pomezzana and Retignano, in Alta Versilia, showed cumulative precipitation values of 478 and 401 mm in 13 hours, respectively. The one in Fornovolasco, in Garfagnana, recorded 408 mm. This tragedy, considered one of the worst floods ever to hit Tuscany after the Florence flood of 1966, also caused a high number of casualties: by the end of the emergency, 13 deaths, almost all in Cardoso, and one missing person were counted."

Within a few hours, an enormous amount of rain fell. In a very short time, the tributary streams of the main rivers became uncontrollable and overflowed, carrying all sorts of debris downstream. The flood wave effect spread to the major rivers, Vara and Magra, which overflowed into the plains around the villages of Borghetto di Vara, Brugnato, Ameglia, Pontremoli, Villafranca in Lunigiana, and Aulla. The disaster also struck the nearby Cinque Terre in the province of La Spezia: water carried huge amounts of mud and debris along the natural drainage channels in the villages of Vernazza and Monterosso, and the main streets turned into raging rivers, dragging everything into the sea. The resulting flood deposit on the main street of Vernazza measured several meters thick. Communications immediately became very difficult: there was also significant damage to road infrastructure with landslides and collapses on several provincial roads (resulting in the isolation of some inland locations), closure of the A12 highway section between the Sestri Levante and Deiva Marina toll booths due to a landslide on the southbound lane, and disruptions on the Levante railway line. On the A12, the landslide involved a truck, and rescuers managed to extract the driver, who was miraculously saved. The state road 1 Via Aurelia was interrupted by multiple landslides, and the railway was blocked by a landslide in Vernazza. Dozens of villages in the Val di Vara became unreachable except by helicopter, and telecommunications were interrupted. Further south in the reference river basin, the effects of the flood occurred in the municipality of Ameglia, at the mouth of the Magra River: in three years, this was the fourth flood, and this time the most significant damage (in addition to houses completely invaded by mud) was suffered by the Colombiera bridge, which collapsed for the second time. A yacht was unmoored by the river's fury and struck the central span of the bridge, destroying it. Over a week after the flood event, in anticipation of a new and maximum weather alert throughout the region (classified as \"Alert 2\" by the meteorological-hydrological functional center of the Liguria Region Civil Protection, forecasted from 10 PM on November 3 to 6 PM on November 6 in the Ligurian maritime basins of Ponente, Centro, Levante, and Padani di Ponente), evacuation orders were issued by the respective mayors of Vernazza and Borghetto di Vara as a precautionary measure. In Val di Vara, landslides continued for days, blocking road communications. On November 5, Camisano (Ameglia) and Pignone were evacuated, Corvara and Bracelli (in the municipality of Beverino) were reported as isolated, and new evacuations occurred in Calice al Cornoviglio, where roads had now opened into frightening chasms. In ten days, four bridges collapsed, and 20 roads were closed between Montemarcello, Rocchetta di Vara, Brugnato, Calice, Pignone, Beverino, Corniglia, Monterosso, and Vernazza."

In Monterosso al Mare and Vernazza, the focus of controversy is the covering of canals, which, with the rainfall, became pressurized. Even in the Cinque Terre, cementification is not ruled out as a cause of the lack of water regulation: in Monterosso, the council allowed the construction of 30 villas in the Meschi area. \n\nIn Brugnato, the Friday before the tragedy, the municipal council voted to approve the construction of a massive outlet that was supposed to be built right in the plain devastated by the flood. The outlet was then regularly built and inaugurated in 2014. The method of cementification of the territory is also under discussion in Aulla, where much of the construction over the past fifty years has been built within the natural riverbed of the Magra River. At the beginning of the flood wave that invaded the town's streets, it seems there was a collapse of the containment basin dam to the north, near Villafranca in Lunigiana. In the days following October 25, institutional authorities visiting Aulla were heavily contested by the locals, including the mayor of Pontremoli, Lucia Baracchini, and Minister Altero Matteoli."

                "content": "The floods of the Vara and the estuarine part of the Magra represent another controversy: public opinion points to the lack of dredging of riverbeds, regulated by Law 183/1989, which classifies the extraction of inert materials along rivers among soil defense interventions, thus establishing, in principle, the public interest in proper hydraulic maintenance as the sole act allowing extractive activities in rivers. As a result, pending the adoption of Basin Plans, extractive activity has been suspended. According to popular beliefs, the rivers would be overloaded with sedimentation material; however, there is a study commissioned by the Interregional Basin Authority of the Magra River, developed by the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the University of Florence, which states that the valley sections of the rivers have not increased sediment levels; on the contrary, they are eroded. Another important point seems to be the lack of maintenance of secondary waterways and tributaries of the Vara and Magra rivers. According to some testimonies, in the municipality of Follo, affected by the flood in the plain, it seems that the water did not come directly from the riverbed but rather from the inability of tributary streams to flow into it. This would have caused damage to culverts (some literally exploded), and their overflow would have flooded buildings located in an area classified by the PAI as flood-prone."

To address the damages caused by the flood, the Berlusconi government increased fuel excise taxes by 0.0089%. \n\nTo fund the flood relief fund, the Liguria Region also decided to increase gasoline excise taxes (+0.5 cents), a measure mandated by the previous government, which, at the initiative of Minister Giulio Tremonti, requested Liguria and Tuscany to raise taxes to support the 40 million allocated for damages."

                "content": "Thousands of volunteers mobilized to help the affected population. Many of them responded to appeals launched on social networks like Facebook: students, workers, spiritual heirs of those \"mud angels\" of Florence. A particular case was that of the \"red bands,\" nearly 400 volunteers from all over Italy (Como, Naples, Pavia, Trento, Parma, Rome, Livorno, etc.) who are identified by a red band on their arm. The idea reproduces an ancient custom of the Lunigiana workers' movement, which, in a late 19th-century photo, depicted workers' teams from Pontremolese with red bands around their waists and arms. Particular attention was paid, from the beginning, to the nature of the aid, especially financial. An example is the Monterosso case, where a fundraising campaign was launched by Repubblica and Sky for the \"rescue\" of the \"Enrico Fermi\" elementary school, but some testimonies revealed that the school building had not suffered significant damage to prevent its use. The question arises as to what the school will be saved from. A year after that tragedy, the first assessments began on the reconstruction and securing of the Spezzino territory. For example, according to some sources, the media and top authorities portrayed the reconstruction of Vernazza as a virtuous example. However, some citizens drafted a dossier showing that the situation is far from virtuous. \n\nIn general, the commitment to safeguarding the territory does not appear particularly significant, with emergency works, a lack of planning interventions, and continuous issuance of building permits for large, highly invasive projects. A shocking example is the collapse of a landslide on the Via dell'Amore in Riomaggiore, following just a few hours of rain."

Unlike the previous ones, this flood did not affect the outlying districts or neighborhoods but the town center and was not an unforeseen event. The alarm had already been raised in the early afternoon of November 15, and the situation became serious around 8 p.m., when the level of the Bisenzio became truly concerning, leading to the decision to close the historic bridge in the town center. Around 10 p.m., the waters of the Bisenzio overflowed into the Santa Maria neighborhood, passing through the houses along the bank, but about twenty minutes later, the Bisenzio broke the embankment-road on the opposite side, in the area of the Corti district, and the flooding of the town center began. The waters inundated a large part of the town center, particularly the districts of Corti and Case Nove and the area of the Central Post Office, reaching the areas of Maccione and Via Palagetta. The only victim of the flood was an 83-year-old woman, Dina Nistri, residing in the Corti area, not far from the breach, who was swept away by the waters in her garden. The damages from the flood, which later sparked a fierce controversy, were estimated at 144 billion lire of the time. From that November 1991, hydraulic restoration and the care of the territory's waterways would become one of the top priorities of the various municipal administrations."

The Bisenzio flood unexpectedly reached the town center late in the evening of November 21, when the river level became alarming, and shortly after, the waters began to overflow into the city streets through the windows of houses along the river. The fate of the municipal capital seemed sealed when the Bisenzio broke its bank at the curve of Via XXIV Maggio near the first houses of the San Martino district. The breach was about fifty meters long, and through it, the river's waters poured into San Martino itself, then reaching San Piero a Ponti and the plain of Sant'Angelo a Lecore, where in the meantime, the Ombrone Pistoiese had also broken its banks. In some areas, the waters reached a level of two meters. At the same time, the Bisenzio and the Marinella stream also broke their banks near the Capalle district, and their waters reached the level of the first floor of houses. The only victim of the flood was a forty-year-old farmer from San Piero a Ponti, Emilio Scuffi, who suffered a heart attack at the sight of the waters flooding his home. The rescue efforts were quite ineffective, although the now-dominant Fascist regime did not allow protests or excessive demands, partly due to the absolute unpreparedness of the municipal administration, which in previous years had even sold two boats purchased for potential emergencies because they had never been used. The flood damage was extensive, and there were no reimbursements, although the repair of the banks by the Civil Engineering Corps was swift and effective. The pedestrian bridge in San Martino, which collapsed, was permanently restored only in 1939. The poor organization of the rescue efforts was ultimately fatal to the last mayor, Emilio Cioppi, who in the following months was replaced by a government-appointed podestà."

In the morning, approximately 120 mm of rain fell specifically on the basin of the latter (bringing the total for the week to 330 mm), which further fed all the tributaries of the Esaro coming from the Cutro area. In the locality of \"Isola Capo Rizzuto station,\" an uncontrollable and violent flood of the same river formed (later calculated with a flow rate of over 1000 m³/s). The flood reached the \"Gabelluccia\" district, on the western outskirts of Crotone, around noon: a mass of water and mud submerged the ground floors of the neighborhood's houses, subsequently spreading toward the industrial area, affecting both the buildings on the left bank, already flooded earlier due to the overflow of the Papaniciaro tributary, and those on the right bank, near the \"Gesù\" district. The water then also reached the historic city center, channeling along Via Nicoletta. The flood caused six fatalities (Paolo Pupa, Angela Trovato, Luca Buscema, Michela Cicchetto, Luca Tavano, and Bruno Comisso) and enormous damage: numerous industrial prefabricated buildings were swept away by the water, and the city's commercial and industrial area was heavily devastated. In some streets of the town center, the water even reached four meters in height. \n\nThe effects of the overflow were further exacerbated by extensive illegal construction: the Gabelluccia and Gesù districts, the latter built near the Montecatini plant, had in fact developed in the 1980s in the river's flood expansion areas. Almost all the bridges were destroyed. A total of 358 businesses were affected, with damages amounting to 126 billion lire in 1996."

                "content": "The Grosseto flood of November 4, 1966, was a catastrophic event that affected the city of Grosseto, the surrounding plain, and part of the Ombrone Valley. The causes were the intense rains that also occurred in the preceding days along the Ombrone River basin and its tributary Orcia. This was part of a widespread event of heavy rains that occurred in much of Italy during those days, leading on the same day to similar floods in Florence, Venice and Chioggia, Pisa, and other cities in central-northern Italy. The waters of the Ombrone broke the banks on the morning of November 4, 1966, and overflowed, flooding the countryside and causing significant damage in the Maremma capital, where in some places the water reached three and a half meters in height. The flood was not an overflow but rather a collapse at four points of the Ombrone River's embankment; it was partly caused by the sirocco winds that slowed the outflow to the sea and by the embankment of the bridge on the Aurelia state road, commonly called the Mussolini bridge. There was only one fatality because November 4 was a holiday at the time, and therefore all major activities were halted. To understand the scale of the phenomenon, it should be noted that the average flow rate of the Ombrone River is 25 m³/s, and on that day it exceeded 4000 m³/s. At the Acquisti Farm, in the countryside of Braccagni north of the city, one victim was recorded, the cowboy Santi Quadalti, swept away by the flood while trying to save his herds, awarded the gold medal."

Another factor that contributed was the presence, above and below the city level, of four main water flows: the Canale Passo di Rigano, the Papireto, the Kemonia, and the Oreto River; some of these channels were artificially diverted below street level. In addition to the large volume of water, the city was hit by a very strong tramontana wind that destroyed several walls."

The damages were estimated to exceed 45 billion lire. The fury of the waters caused extensive landslides, one of which, detaching from the slope of a recently deforested mountain, swept away the village of Molina and a nearby monumental aqueduct bridge called the \"Devil's Bridge.\" The two streams, Bonea and Cavaiola, originating from Cava de' Tirreni, carried such a quantity of debris downstream that they expanded and increased the current beach of Vietri sul Mare, known as Marina. The entire Salerno coastline changed its appearance, advancing in many areas due to the deposit of debris. In Maiori, the upper hamlets, much of the historic center, and some buildings along the Reginna stream were damaged. The stream, obstructed by tree trunks carried downstream by the waters, eroded the foundations of the buildings along its course, causing their facades to collapse.  \nSubsequently, the destroyed houses were replaced with modern buildings, which now characterize the center of Maiori.  \nIn the Town Hall, there is a plaque commemorating and listing the names of the 37 victims of the October 1954 flood."

These two domains are well differentiated and described by numerous geological surveys conducted in both historical and recent times. They constitute two sets with different densities, with compact limestone and the layers of pyroclasts being looser and more incoherent. These two layers were held together by natural vegetation and also by terraced farming practices. The abandonment of the latter has allowed the slopes to be invaded by ruderal vegetation, which has often been burned and does not, in fact, ensure the same continuity between limestone and pyroclasts."

This event caused the dissolution of the continuity between limestone and pyroclasts, leading to the catastrophic sliding of the latter over the former. On May 5 at 3:00 PM, the first landslide detached from Mount Pizzo d'Alvano, narrowly missing the underlying settlements, while rain relentlessly poured over Sarno, Bracigliano, and Siano. The Salerno prefecture was informed of the landslides only around 4:30 PM. At 5:00 PM, several landslides and debris flows began sliding downhill, overwhelming Sarno and nearby locations, destroying dozens of homes. Meanwhile, reports of a landslide in Siano also arrived. The first rescue teams reached the valley about an hour later, just as a mud and debris avalanche struck Quindici, located on the opposite side of Pizzo d'Alvano, burying the center and the Casamanzi hamlet. Shortly after, the Episcopio hamlet of Sarno was hit by a massive flow that destroyed the entire settlement. During the evening, as other landslides struck Sarno and Quindici, causing some blackouts, several dead and injured were pulled from the mud; the injured were transported to the area's main hospital, Villa Malta in Sarno. However, the situation reached catastrophic proportions between 11:31 PM and midnight on May 6, when a massive landslide once again overwhelmed Sarno, invading the Villa Malta hospital and burying under the mud two doctors, three nurses, the hospital porter, and five patients (including two children). The first helicopters flew over the area only after 6:00 AM."

This is communicated for the purpose of activating all necessary measures to ensure the safeguarding of public and private safety.\" Once the severity of the situation was confirmed, numerous detachments of law enforcement, firefighters, and volunteers from all over Italy rushed to the site to assist the affected populations. In addition to the high number of victims - including several children - many people were rescued from the mudslide; among them was the current deputy mayor Roberto Robustelli, then a student in his early twenties, who was pulled out alive after more than three days from the basement where he had been dragged by the force of the mud. After the initial emergency phase was over, some criminal proceedings were initiated against members of the Sarno city administration to ascertain any responsibilities. On May 5, 2010, Mayor Gerardo Basile, initially found not guilty of the charge of multiple manslaughter in the first two levels of judgment, had the appeal sentence annulled by the Court of Cassation. This judgment - motivated by the fact that, according to the Court, the mayor's conduct was \"passive\" in managing the events - referred the case back to the Naples Court of Appeal for a new trial. In December 2011, the Court of Appeal sentenced Basile to five years of imprisonment, confirmed by the Court of Cassation in 2013 (Cass. pen., sez. III, n. 19507/2013); the sentence was then reduced by three years due to the 2006 pardon, while the remaining two years were served under probationary supervision in social services."

The warm winds blowing over the mountains also melted the early snowfalls that had occurred. The millers and residents in houses along the riverbanks were therefore prepared to face the flood but not the extent it would reach. Measures were taken to reinforce the moorings at San Lorenzo, the Filippini area, Via Sottoriva, and other more exposed areas, and barriers were used to protect doors and windows on the ground floors. Among the causes of the violent flood were the modifications to the river's course in the Trentino area, carried out during the construction of the Brenner railway, and the regulation of many streams, which increased the speed of the flood wave. There was also talk of agricultural works that had altered the river's hydrography upstream of the city. September 14 was the most frightening day. Many mills broke the chains with which they had been previously secured and were swept away by the current. One crashed into the Ponte Nuovo, destroying it. By September 17, over two-thirds of Verona were submerged; boats could not even pass under the arches of Porta Borsari. At Ponte Pietra, the water had reached a height of 4.5 meters above the warning mark, while the estimated current speed was 20 km/h. The immediate and crucial mobilization of the army brought landing craft and military engineering units from as far as Legnago and Peschiera del Garda. The city was plunged into darkness, many people were isolated, and some houses collapsed. In the Piazza Isolo area, 11 residents died in the collapse of their home. On September 27, the city was visited by King Umberto I, who came from Rome to witness the catastrophe and bring comfort to the people of Verona."

Despite expectations of years of work or even doubts about the city's ultimate survival, remedies were achieved in relatively short times.

In the Meuse basin, high water levels occurred after a period of persistent rain. On December 20, 1993, the Meuse overflowed its banks for the first time, and on December 22, this happened in multiple places in the province of Limburg. The areas around Roermond and Venlo, and specifically the villages of Gennep, Itteren, and Borgharen, located on the eastern bank, were affected. On the western bank, Neer was the hardest hit. Approximately 8% (18,000 hectares) of the surface area of the province of Limburg was underwater. Some municipalities in Brabant along the Meuse also experienced flooding. About 12,000 people were evacuated. The total damage amounted to 254 million guilders. Such a high discharge had never been measured before: 3,120 m3/s. In Borgharen, the Meuse reached a record height of 45.90 meters above NAP. Just over a year later, in January 1995, the areas along the Meuse were again hit by large-scale flooding."

Between May 15 and May 20, 2010, 350 to 370 mm of rain fell in the Czech catchment area of the Oder. This quickly led to the formation of an extreme flood. At the Czech-Polish border, the second largest flow rate since records began was recorded on May 17, with approximately 2,100 cubic meters per second. In 1997, over 2,800 cubic meters per second were discharged here. The third largest flood is considered to be that of August 1985, with 1,155 cubic meters per second. The Buków flood polder (Oder km 29–32.5), completed in 2002, was opened during the night of May 17 to 18 and relieved the Oder by approximately 300 cubic meters per second, reducing the flow in the Oder from 74% to now 63% of the peak flow of 1997. At the downstream Oder gauge in Miedonia, the peak level on May 18 was accordingly 1.6 m below the peak value of 1997, but it is still the second highest water level recorded there since 1947."

Since all three neighboring countries had made enormous efforts for flood protection after the devastating Oder flood of 1997, the damages remained far below those of the summer of 1997. At the same time, and caused by the same rainfall event, the Vistula basin was also hit by a catastrophic flood with massive damages and loss of life."

Between May 15 and May 20, 2010, 350 to 370 mm of rain fell in the Czech catchment area of the Oder. This quickly led to the formation of an extreme flood. At the Czech-Polish border, the second largest flow rate since records began was recorded on May 17, with approximately 2,100 cubic meters per second. In 1997, over 2,800 cubic meters per second were discharged here. The third largest flood is considered to be that of August 1985, with 1,155 cubic meters per second. The Buków flood polder (Oder km 29–32.5), completed in 2002, was opened during the night of May 17 to 18 and relieved the Oder by approximately 300 cubic meters per second, reducing the flow in the Oder from 74% to now 63% of the peak flow of 1997. At the downstream Oder gauge in Miedonia, the peak level on May 18 was accordingly 1.6 m below the peak value of 1997, but it is still the second highest water level recorded there since 1947."

Alert level IV was declared on May 26 and 28 for these river sections and remained in effect until the end of May. Alert level III applied to the entire lower Oder section. It was not until June 23, 2010, that the entire German/Polish Oder section was free of alert levels again."

After the water levels of the rivers were already very high due to prolonged rain in May and June, hot days in early summer followed, causing intense snowmelt. In mid-July, continuous rain set in (according to the Bern Chronicle by Diebold Schilling, it rained torrentially for three days without interruption), which led to the flood.[1]"

In the same department, the town of Moissac is the most affected by these devastating floods. The departments of Aude, Lot-et-Garonne (notably Agen), and Tarn are also particularly impacted. These catastrophic events led to a national day of mourning on March 9, 1930 — the first in France in the 20th century — after the then-President of the Republic, Gaston Doumergue, himself a native of southern France, visited the affected areas, accompanied by André Tardieu. The French government allocated significant financial aid to rebuild the devastated areas, supported by national and international solidarity (Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, Morocco), particularly in Moissac, the most severely affected town by these exceptional floods described as the \"flood of the century.\" François Coty contributed to the efforts by building four model farms designed by architects to withstand future floods, offering them outright to deserving families. Pope Pius XI sent a check to the Bishop of Montauban to assist the victims. The number of deaths caused by these floods is now estimated at around 700."

The commune of Le Caylar received 448 mm of rainfall in 24 hours, which was a record for the Hérault department until September 16, 2023, when Roqueredonde received 550 mm in 24 hours. These rains followed weather conditions above the norms for the region, with average temperatures higher than normal, coupled with a low-pressure area in the Bay of Biscay. The next day, the rains continued in Gard, particularly in the morning, where the regions of Sommières and Nîmes were swept by a brief and violent storm accompanied by strong wind gusts, as well as part of Ardèche. The rain front then crossed the Rhône to affect the departments of Vaucluse and Drôme. The showers on September 22 resulted from a west/east storm front blocked on the western flank of Mont Ventoux from the afternoon. With this stationary storm system over part of the Ouvèze watershed, the commune of Orange, in the northwest of the Vaucluse department, received 51 mm of cumulative rainfall, while Carpentras, south of the Dentelles de Montmirail, received 212 mm."

That same evening, the prefect of Vaucluse relayed this alert to set up security and protection services. On September 22, 1992, two other messages from Météo-France in Marignane, late at night and early in the morning, confirmed the alert, announcing storms of rare violence. Despite this, the rain, which was heavy over Vaison-la-Romaine in the middle of the morning, stopped around noon. The city's emergency services faced several challenges: the events occurred on a Tuesday, the day of the weekly market, with increased crowds; evacuation requests made to customers and tourists (then numerous at the end of the summer season) at the municipal campsite, located upstream of the Roman bridge, had little effect. The first moderate downpour (17.8 mm) fell between 10 a.m. and noon. It was followed, in the early afternoon, by a second much more violent one (182.7 mm) that lasted until 3:15 p.m. The teachers at Jules Ferry School, then located near the Ouvèze river, secured the students on the first floor of the building farthest from the river. The total rainfall in Entrechaux was 300 mm (300 liters of water per square meter) in six hours (possibly slightly more locally). For comparison, the annual average rainfall in Paris is 637 mm. During this meteorological event, nearly 1,320 km² received more than 100 mm of precipitation. The storm, of unprecedented violence, stagnated over the slopes of Mont Ventoux for several hours. It poured 215 mm of water in Malaucène, 179 mm in Vaison, and 143 mm in Buis-les-Baronnies. The heavy rains upstream of Vaison-la-Romaine were such that a mudslide, about 50 cm thick, invaded and completely covered the municipal campsite around 3 p.m. A water height of 10 cm already covered the streets of the lower town. The first news arrived: there were deaths at the Moulin de César campsite. The section reserved for the À cœur joie associative campsite—450 pitches—was swept away. It was learned that there were numerous victims in the Théos neighborhood subdivision, located on the right bank, which was submerged by the floodwaters. At the same time, a torrent of mud swept through the municipal campsite, carrying everything in its path: caravans, vehicles, and campers. In the minutes that followed, at the level of the Roman bridge, whose deck is less than twenty meters above the river's normal level, the water reached 17 meters, 15 meters above its normal course. Images of caravans crashing against the Roman bridge remain etched in memories. The fire station, located near the Ouvèze riverbed, was flooded, including the building and rescue equipment. The ORSEC Plan was activated at 5 p.m. The water level only began to recede after 10 p.m. Of the three bridges over the Ouvèze, only the ancient Roman bridge withstood the flood, despite some damage to its parapet."

                "content": "Later, it will be learned that the same phenomenon had already occurred, at least once, in Vaison. In the municipal archives of the city, a deliberation dated August 1616 indicates that \"the city council had to repair the parapet of the Roman bridge destroyed by a flood that also swept away several houses.\" No victims were reported. In the 17th century, the inhabitants of Vaison lived in the upper town, and around the cathedral, covering the ruins of ancient Vasio, there were only gardens. The risk was, however, known but neglected. Before the tragedy, following the disaster of October 3, 1988, in Nîmes, engineer Ponton mentioned in his April 1989 report 62 towns, including Vaison-la-Romaine, likely to be affected by floods caused by rainwater runoff. Jean-Pierre Mazeillier had described Vaison's Land Use Plan (POS) as \"completely insane\" when he took over the technical services of the town hall and could not find any trace of Ponton's report. The 1982 Deferre decentralization law had transferred urban planning authority from the prefect to the mayors. On October 14, 1983, the then-mayor, André Thès, revised the POS and declared the right bank of the Ouvèze constructible over more than a kilometer. The area had not even been classified as a \"minor flood zone.\" The price of the land had increased by a factor of more than 10. Scientific studies were conducted on the centennial flood of 1992. They provide the reasons for the extent of the damage. In the area of the Salette torrent, a tributary of the Brégoux, itself a tributary of the Ouvèze, in the heart of the Dentelles de Montmirail, 200.5 millimeters of rain fell within five hours. The figures are known thanks to the Bernardins station in Beaumes-de-Venise. This represented a volume of 4.2 million cubic meters of water falling into the watershed of this torrent, which has an area of only 28 km². The report of the commission of inquiry on \"the causes of floods and ways to remedy them\" also mentions other reasons such as a specific geological impermeability in this Ouvèze valley but also aggravating anthropogenic modifications: \"an impermeabilization of the soil causing urban rainwater runoff and finally the presence of constructions in the very bed of the river.\" The Ouvèze is a 123 km river, originating in Montauban-sur-Ouvèze, in the Drôme department, and flowing into the Rhône at Sorgues, after passing through 28 municipalities. Many watercourses are tributaries of the Ouvèze, notably the Toulourenc, between Mollans-sur-Ouvèze and Entrechaux. Of the 820 km² of the Ouvèze watershed, 580 km² are located upstream of Vaison-la-Romaine."

                "content": "This tragedy of September 22 caused the death of more than 40 people, swept away by the Ouvèze or its tributaries. The most commonly reported number of victims is 46 deaths, plus one in Beaumes-de-Venise, regularly omitted from statistics. Thirty-eight people lost their lives that day in Haut-Vaucluse, including 34 in Vaison-la-Romaine. Among them were fifteen residents of the Theos housing estate and at least eleven residents of the Moulin de César campsite. This extraordinary flood struck many villages downstream of Vaison, also causing deaths: three in Séguret; an elderly farmer who went to fetch his cow in Gigondas, which was found alive; four campers swept away by the Brégoux waters in Aubignan; a pedestrian who tried to cross the bridge swept away by the Salette flood in Beaumes-de-Venise, as well as four missing persons, including a six-month-old baby. Nine months later, in 1993, a body was found in the commune of Roaix by a firefighter and his search dog from Vaison. Without the courage of a firefighter who saved 36 people with a borrowed boat, the death toll would have been much higher. As the waters receded on the morning of September 23, bulldozers and trucks were able to work in the streets to remove vehicle carcasses covered in river silt and all the debris it had carried. To prevent looting, the flooded area was cordoned off by the army, with soldiers monitoring the entrances to the city and the main affected villages and patrolling in front of houses. In the five years following the disaster, the investigation stalled. Only the prefect of Vaucluse, who was in office in 1965, was implicated in 1995. The judge closed the investigation at the beginning of 1998 after ordering new investigations into the studies conducted for building permits. These \"clearly implicated the systematic concreting of risk areas, particularly the natural flood expansion basins of rivers and streams.\" Two years after the disaster, building permit applications were submitted to construct in the city's flood-prone areas. Some survivors in Vaison were able to resettle in Clos d'Ariston, a plot purchased and developed by the municipality. Few of them left the city, as insurance compensated them well, and others were able to purchase older properties."

In the five years following the disaster, 115 million francs of work were carried out, equivalent to 17.5 million euros. Furthermore, this renovation had an increased cost. The final bill amounted to nearly 460 million euros in damages, including 20 million for Vaison alone. Ultimately, for this single municipality, the work amounted to approximately 26 million euros, of which nearly 8 million was borne by Vaison and its 6,000 inhabitants. While everything was done to prevent another disaster, it came at the cost of heavy indebtedness."

The first measure taken was to make the areas along the Ouvèze non-buildable. Seventy homes, including an entire housing development, were demolished. The riverbed was widened, and the banks were reinforced. Upstream, the municipal campsite was relocated and elevated. Where the Théos housing development once stood, massive stone blocks reinforced the bank, and a natural area was created. Further along, a fitness trail now covers the former Jardins de l'Ouvèze neighborhood, and the Eminées and Magnans housing developments have been turned into green spaces. The school was rebuilt. It is protected, like the lower town, by a long wall serving as a levee. Evacuation drills are held every year in all classes. If intervention were needed, the Vaison firefighters, thanks to alert systems, are notified of a flood in T + 2. Two non-compressible hours, but enough to evacuate everyone. The alert is given thanks to the installation of weather radars in Bollène and in the Gard. In 1992, according to the mayor at the time, there were none, although there was one in Nîmes named Mélody, but it had been struck by lightning the evening before..."

Many have reopened their businesses on-site for economic reasons: relocating would have required both purchasing new land and rebuilding, and insurance did not cover it. However, a new business area was created on higher ground but attracted only two companies. Moreover, \"local media regularly report on local urban planning (PLU) being challenged and most often annulled a few months later by the courts. The main reasons are almost systematically, aside from procedural irregularities, the transformation of agricultural land, often located in flood-prone areas or adjacent to them, into building plots.\" The primary cause is that land prices have skyrocketed throughout the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. Due to quality of life and sunshine, it is the region in France with the fastest-growing population, attracting retirees as well as active families. Thus, for some, the temptation is great to multiply the value of agricultural land by twenty or thirty times simply by reclassifying it as building land. In the event of a flood, even less severe than that of September 22, everyone knows that the damage would be considerable, including loss of human life."

It then moved eastward, stopping over the western districts of the city between Pegli, Sestri Ponente, and the Polcevera Valley, where it unleashed its full power, causing a true flash flood. In about five hours, between 8:00 and 13:00, over 400 mm of water fell on the heights of Sestri Ponente, 380 mm on those of Pegli, and about 300 mm on the lower Polcevera Valley between Pontedecimo and the mouth of the stream. A few dozen millimeters more of rain could have caused the overflow of the Polcevera and many other secondary streams, resulting in significant damage."

Almost the entire lower part of Sestri Ponente and Multedo was flooded: shops, garages, basements, squares, and streets were damaged, and the water flow carried away parked cars. A worker from the nearby Monte Gazzo quarries fell along with an embankment swallowed by the fury of the Chiaravagna stream and was found a few days later in the sea off Sestri Ponente: he was the only victim of the flood event. The Molinassi stream, which flows covered by the Fincantieri warehouses for the last 440 meters, broke its right bank, an old stone wall, near Piazza Clavarino, flooding the western part of Sestri Ponente and merging its waters with those that had overflowed from the Cantarena stream in Via Leoncavallo, a street under which it flows for the last 300 meters of its course. In the eastern part of the district, it was instead the Chiaravagna stream that overflowed at the dam created by the building at Via Giotto 15, constructed directly over its bed and later demolished in March 2013. The westernmost part was also flooded by the Marotto stream and the Zanino and Monferrato creeks, which violently emerged from the network of tunnels into which they had been channeled during the first half of the 20th century under the abandoned industrial warehouses of the former Multedo foundry and those that now house the Coop and other productive activities, and discharged into the sea beyond the Genoa-Ventimiglia railway line, a short distance from the oil port docks. Other floods, fortunately without serious consequences, occurred in other low-lying areas of the west, such as the Multedo railway underpass, the one near Piazza Brin in Certosa, and the entire Fiumara area in Sampierdarena."

The rise in the level of the Mēmele River caused by heavy summer rains on June 20 swept along logs floated down the river, flooded the streets of Bauska's old town near the river, and destroyed part of the Mēmele Bridge. The rainy summer of 1928 caused floods in many parts of Latvia and southern Estonia. During these years, there was active floating of logs cut in forests down rivers to sawmills in Bauska, Jelgava, and Riga. By early June, a dangerously large accumulation of logs had formed near the Mēmele Bridge. However, the major floods began a couple of weeks later when the pressure of the Mēmele waters broke through the log jams about four kilometers before Bauska, and the logs carried by the current piled up at the Mēmele Bridge. Due to the rains on June 20 and 21, the water volume in the Mēmele had doubled. The massive log jam blocked the river and raised the water level by 6 meters above normal, flooding many city streets. The overflowing river carried along poorly secured log rafts, which accumulated at the Mēmele Bridge, forming a wooden dam. Riverside buildings and streets were flooded. On Friday, June 22, at 4:00 a.m., the logs carried by the current broke through about a 10-meter section of the bridge. The water and logs partially destroyed several buildings. The river water carved a path along the riverbank on the old town side, washing away and partially destroying riverside sheds, the Jewish synagogue, and several other buildings. The most affected by the floods were the Lower Mill owned by the German Steben, with damages amounting to 8 million rubles, while Theodor Lodiņš's brewery suffered losses of 300,000 rubles."

The removal of logs was organized by the Bauska municipality, involving 350 workers for this task. Under the leadership of the city's ladies, Mrs. Jura Varenā, a notary and head of the Latvian Red Cross Bauska branch, a relief committee was established, which used the funds allocated by the Red Cross to distribute food—soup, bread, butter, meat, fish, sugar, etc.—to those affected by the floods for a couple of weeks. In the first days, 300 people received aid, with each person being allocated assistance worth 64 santims per day. The destroyed bridge meant that Bauska no longer had land connections with 16 out of the 20 parishes in the district. Trade in the market stopped, and industrial production decreased. Just a few weeks later, a raft bridge was opened for horse traffic, and a wooden footbridge was built for pedestrians."

On the morning of October 9, around eight o'clock, a period of rainfall began, although not very heavy, which lasted for 12 hours, until about 8 p.m. Shortly after 8 p.m., weather conditions worsened, precipitation levels increased significantly, and stronger winds began to blow. Around 8:30 p.m., the situation escalated, and the flow of the streams increased noticeably until they finally violently overflowed their banks. The conditions were set for one of the worst natural disasters ever to strike Madeira Island. The origin of such a great tragedy lay in an atmospheric situation characterized by southwesterly winds, thunderstorms, and heavy rainfall. The deforestation of the mountains overlooking Funchal, clearly visible in engravings of the time, and the lack of channeling of the streams within urban areas contributed to the worsening of the catastrophe. Faced with the seriousness of the situation, many inhabitants, caught by surprise, were unable to escape the danger and ended up dying. Some were caught in their escape by the strong currents that had meanwhile overflowed the banks of the streams, while many did not even attempt to flee, perishing when their own houses collapsed or being crushed by falling walls."

One of the particularly affected areas was the neighborhood of Santa Maria Maior. The walls of the Ribeira de João Gomes, whose flow had already increased due to the intense rainfall of the previous days, burst in three locations. The water that overflows the banks at these three points forms currents so violent that they destroy almost everything in their path and are responsible for the deaths of dozens of people. According to accounts from the time, entire streets and numerous buildings were swept into the sea. The Parish Church of Nossa Senhora do Calhau itself, located on the left bank of the stream, succumbed to the violence of the waters. In a single house in this area, 21 inhabitants died. In another building in Pelourinho, an English subject and 15 other family members perished. The estimated number of victims in this neighborhood is shocking; it is calculated that, in this area alone, the flood claimed the lives of around 200 people. The streams of Santa Luzia and Bom Jesus were also unable to withstand the high water flow, which ended up overflowing the banks and causing great destruction. Rua dos Ferreiros suffered considerable damage, with several residential and commercial buildings destroyed. The description is similar for Rua dos Tanoeiros and Rua Direita, where the scene of destruction was repeated."

The same archive describes as \"prodigious\" the fact that only 14 people perished (swept away by the intensity of the currents or buried in their own homes), given the intensity of the catastrophe. The historic Chapel of the Lord of Miracles (at the time called the Chapel of Christ), one of the oldest on Madeira Island, was also affected, being almost completely destroyed by the currents. From the original chapel, only the ogival door and the crosses on the façade remained. The image of the crucified Christ was swept out to sea and presumed lost; however, it was eventually recovered, almost intact, by an American galleon that delivered it to the Funchal Cathedral. This event, considered miraculous by the region's inhabitants, led to the chapel being renamed the Chapel of the Lord of Miracles, as well as to a pilgrimage (one of the largest on the island) that takes place every year on October 9th in honor of the Lord of Miracles. In addition to the Chapel of the Lord of Miracles, some churches were also damaged, as well as the archives of Foros, chapels, and brotherhoods."

                "content": "The number of deaths resulting from this tragedy is not consensual. Some sources point to a number very close to 1,000 fatalities. According to Cabral Nascimento, in a long study on these events published in the Madeira Historical Archive (Volumes 1 and 5), this flood is said to have caused more than 700 fatalities, and beyond the city, there was also significant damage in other parishes in the south of the island, namely in Campanário, Calheta, Tabua, Ribeira Brava, Santa Cruz, and especially in Machico, where fourteen people died. The governor and captain general D. José Manuel da Câmara, given the severity of the events, issued a decree adopting the necessary measures to mitigate the effects of the catastrophe. One of the first measures adopted was, naturally, to seek shelter for the many people who had been left homeless. Temporary accommodation was provided in various public buildings, state service offices, churches, chapels, fortresses, as well as many private homes. Another urgent measure was the prohibition of price increases for essential goods under the penalty of severe punishments for offenders. Not remaining insensitive to the suffering of the Madeirans, the metropolitan government, in February 1804, sent Brigadier Reinaldo Oudinot to Madeira with the task of overseeing the much-needed recovery works. On February 19, 1804, Brigadier Reinaldo Oudinot, a reputed engineering specialist, arrived in Madeira with the mission of directing the recovery work for the damage caused by the great flood and guiding the construction of the lateral walls of the streams. From the beginning, he demonstrated high competence in performing his duties. In a short period, he managed to channel the three streams that cross Funchal. He is also responsible for one of the great moments of urban planning in the city of Funchal, drafting a plan for its reconstruction, which referred to the expansion of the city to the north, east, and west. Outside Funchal, he also carried out laborious activities, promoting the widening and reinforcement of the walls along the banks of the Machico stream. He promoted the rapid reconstruction of many damaged structures in various parts of the island, relying on the free manual labor of many Madeirans who only received basic necessities and exemption from certain taxes, all in accordance with the old \"Ordinances,\" which had been in force since the beginning of settlement to address exceptional events. Reinaldo Oudinot would pass away in the city of Funchal on February 11, 1807, but his services were not forgotten by the inhabitants of this city, who named a street after him on the left bank of the João Gomes stream, between Campo da Barca and Praça dos Lavradores."

There was much unrest among people, and there were also issues in the areas of Colonnata with the temporary suspension of gas in homes, Forno, and Torano. The maximum rainfall capacity reached 140 millimeters within an hour and a half, which was not predicted by weather reports."

In southern Poland, high water levels persisted for 2-3 days, causing seepage and breaches in the Vistula levees. There were also failures of hydrotechnical structures (including the breach of the cofferdam of the under-construction Wióry reservoir on the Świślina River, which consequently flooded the southern part of Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski).  \n\nThe damages from the flood were estimated at 4 billion zlotys[1]. In Gdańsk, the flood occurred on July 9, 2001[2]. As a result, significant areas of the city were affected, including those along the Radunia Canal in the districts of Orunia-Św. Wojciech-Lipce and Śródmieście, as well as areas in the Wrzeszcz Górny and Wrzeszcz Dolny districts located along the Strzyża stream. Heavy rainfall also affected areas such as Maków Podhalański, where 94.6 mm of rain fell on July 24, and as much as 190.8 mm on July 25. This caused a rise in water levels in rivers and streams, resulting in, among other things, the destruction of the market square, damage to municipal infrastructure, railway track breaches, and damage to numerous homes. According to estimates, damages to public property exceeded 20 million zlotys[3]."

                "content": "The Alpine river Lech, the second-largest tributary of the Bavarian Danube after the Inn in terms of water flow, has experienced severe flooding since time immemorial. Its riverbed was originally mostly flat, kilometers wide, and braided. Almost every year, it swelled to many times its normal width and repeatedly carved out a new bed in its gravel deposits. Corrections to its riverbed from the late Middle Ages to the 19th century were primarily intended to make it navigable for timber rafting, which increased its flow velocity, causing it to deepen its bed more and more. From Augsburg to its confluence with the Danube, the Lech had already been flowing in an artificially regulated bed since the 1850s, but upstream it remained largely natural. In June 1910, there was still a lot of snow in the Tyrolean mountains, which melted within a short time due to heavy downpours on June 14. The simultaneous inflow of precipitation and meltwater caused the Lech to swell into a raging torrent. In the Tyrolean Lech Valley, it swept away seven bridges, and numerous timber rafting weirs and barriers fell victim to it. Near Steeg, it carried almost 300 cubic meters of water per second—compared to an average of only 12 cubic meters per second. At that time, the Forggensee, which could have absorbed the flood peaks, did not yet exist. On the evening of June 15, the Lech reached a flow rate of over 1,000 cubic meters per second according to measurements at the time, or over 1,400 cubic meters per second according to today's estimates, at Landsberg and destroyed the Karolinenwehr there. In the lowlands of the Lechfeld, it flowed up to four kilometers wide. It reached almost to the settlement edge of Mering on the right and into the town of Haunstetten on the left. In Rain, located five kilometers before its confluence with the Danube, the entire area north of the old town was flooded, causing significant damage in the so-called Vorstadt (Donauwörther Straße area). In Oberndorf am Lech, all local streets were under water. The peak flow at the Lech's confluence on June 16, 1910, was measured at 1,250 cubic meters per second (average flow 116 cubic meters). Other rivers, such as the Iller, also experienced severe flooding at the same time, causing significant damage."

                "content": "At the Augsburger Hochablass, the yellow-brown flood initially tore away a section of the weir, which was made of wood but generally resistant to high water, at the two gravel outlets. Then, due to the resulting gap, it destroyed further parts of the weir up to the raft channel. Subsequently, the water destroyed the Stadtbach main sluice, the historic main sluice building from 1798, and the restoration building. With the greatest efforts, the deployed military and fire brigade managed to protect the fountain works at the Hochablass—a structure on which Augsburg's drinking water supply completely depended—from destruction by reinforcing the bank there with felled trees, gravel-filled crates, sandbags, and other natural materials. To reduce the risk of further damage, the entire Hochablass weir was blown up, leaving only a small remaining stump on the eastern bank. Below the weir, where the riverbed was deeply eroded, the river tore away large stretches of the bank and destroyed seven properties on the Hochzoll bank. Parts of Hochzoll, Lechhausen, and the Jakobervorstadt were flooded. The tracks of Line I of the Augsburger Localbahn were undermined and damaged. The 52-meter-high church tower of St. Pankratius in Lechhausen was severely damaged. The railway weir broke, putting the railway bridge near Hochzoll in great danger as its central pillar was at risk of being undermined. In Gersthofen, a large section of the railway bridge, which was only seven years old, was torn away."

Following the flood disaster, Augsburg faced great hardship due to a lack of water, as the breach of the Hochablass weir caused the main city canal and the Lech canals supplied by it to dry up. All hydropower plants on these canals came to a standstill. Large companies switched to coal-powered steam engines, while many smaller ones ceased operations entirely. Since all of the city's wastewater also flowed through these canals, their drying up posed a threat to the health of the population. A short-term reconstruction of the Hochablass weir was out of the question. Therefore, a new temporary Lech diversion was created further upstream to supply the main city canal with water again."

The Yodo River rapidly swelled. On the 16th, tributaries on the right bank of the Yodo River, including the Hio River (Takatsuki City), Akuta River (Takatsuki City), Aii River (Ibaraki City), and Ibaraki River (Ibaraki City), overflowed. On the 17th, the embankment of the Amano River, a tributary on the left bank in Okashinmachi, Hirakata City, collapsed. Later that night, the main embankment of the Yodo River in Ikaga, Hirakata City, broke over a span of 30 ken (approximately 182 meters), an event known as the \"Ikaga Break.\" This breach eventually expanded to 60 ken (approximately 364 meters), causing water to flood the southern side of the Yodo River. Embankments on the left bank of the Yodo River collapsed in various locations, and water from tributaries and irrigation channels also overflowed, inundating the northern part of the Kawachi Plain. The water reached the embankment of the Neyagawa River, where it temporarily stopped, preventing damage south of the Neyagawa River. However, on the 20th, the Onji River in Nakakawachi District overflowed.  \n\nThe flooded area extended over a wide range, including present-day Osaka City’s Miyakojima Ward, Asahi Ward, Joto Ward, Tsurumi Ward, Moriguchi City, Kadoma City, Neyagawa City, Hirakata City, Settsu City, Ibaraki City, and Takatsuki City.  \n\nAs the floodwaters temporarily subsided, Osaka Prefecture Governor Genzaburo Tateno decided to intentionally breach the embankment of the Okawa River to release the massive amount of water, employing a method known as \"intentional break,\" which had been used repeatedly since the Edo period. From the 20th to the 23rd, a 26-ken section of the left bank embankment of the Okawa River behind Daicho-ji Temple (currently the site of Fujita Residence Memorial Park) in Amijimacho, Miyakojima Ward, where the Okawa and Neyagawa Rivers converge, was intentionally breached to drain the water.  \n\nOn the 25th, embankment repairs began in Ikaga, Hirakata City, and on the 28th, Minister of Finance Masayoshi Matsukata inspected the construction work."

On the 29th, the wind intensified, and on July 1st, a storm hit, causing the Ikaga embankment, which was under repair, to collapse again on the 2nd, leading to the Yodo River overflowing to the south once more. Furthermore, three sections of the embankment in Sakuranomiya, now part of Miyakojima Ward, also collapsed, and water from the Okawa River entered through the embankment behind Daicho-ji, which had been intentionally breached. \n\nThis flood did not stop there. The embankment of the Neyagawa River, which had prevented further damage during the previous flood, collapsed at Tokuan in the current Tsurumi Ward. As other rivers flowing into the Neyagawa River also overflowed, the flood expanded south of the Neyagawa River. By early July, a large lake, larger than the now-vanished Fukano and Shinkai Ponds from the Edo period reclamation, and resembling the former Kawachi Lake, reappeared on the surface. \n\nAdditionally, a storm surge caused water from Osaka Bay to flow back up the Ajigawa River, flooding the current Kita and Nishi Wards. However, the area around Osaka Tenmangu Shrine, being slightly elevated, escaped flooding. \n\nDue to the July flood, areas that had been flooded in June were inundated again, and new areas, including the current Kita, Fukushima, Konohana, Nishi, Minato, Higashinari, and Ikuno Wards of Osaka City, as well as Higashi-Osaka City, Daito City, and Shijonawate City, were flooded. The flooded area covered approximately 15,269 chobu (15,142 hectares), with 72,509 households, about 20% of the total households in Osaka Prefecture at the time, experiencing flooding up to 4 meters deep. Additionally, 1,749 houses were washed away, about 15,000 houses were damaged, 512 bridges were washed away, 224 embankments collapsed, and there were 81 deaths or missing persons, with 304,199 people affected. \n\nOf the houses washed away, 739 were in the Barada District and 836 in the Higashinari District, accounting for 90% of the total. Of the deaths and missing persons, 49 were in the Barada District and 13 in the Higashinari District, making up 77% of the total. However, in terms of the number of flooded houses, Nishi Ward had 23,116, Nishinari District had 14,253, and Kita Ward had 8,691, surpassing the Barada District's 6,996 and Higashinari District's 4,421. This was mainly due to the storm surge caused by the typhoon. \n\nUltimately, in Osaka City, except for the area north of the Yodo River, which suffered less damage, most low-lying areas, excluding the vicinity of Osaka Tenmangu Shrine, the Uemachi Plateau between Osaka Castle and Tennoji, the Semba area, and the southern part of Osaka City, were affected by the flood. \n\nIn addition to the Kawasaki Bridge upstream on the Okawa River, the three major bridges of Naniwa—Tenmabashi, Tenjinbashi, and the southern half of Naniwabashi (the northern half was an iron bridge)—as well as Yodoyabashi, were washed away. The Ajigawa Bridge, a state-of-the-art movable iron bridge, became clogged with drifting debris, blocking the river, and was hastily blown up by the army. In this way, more than 30 of Osaka's famous \"808 bridges\" were washed away, cutting off almost all city traffic. On the 7th, the army set up a pontoon bridge on the south side of Naniwabashi. \n\nWhen the storm subsided, the flood finally stopped moving. As the water level of the Yodo River gradually decreased, the water accumulated in the flooded areas was drained through the repaired embankments, including the one behind Daicho-ji, though it took a long time. \n\nAfter this flood, the surrounding districts launched a petition movement to Osaka Prefecture and the national government for the improvement of the Yodo River. Eventually, the Osaka Prefectural Assembly also submitted a proposal to the national government. These efforts, led by Fusataro Ohashi, bore fruit, and in 1896 (Meiji 29), after the First Sino-Japanese War, the Public River Law, which included the improvement of the Yodo River, was enacted, and the budget for the Yodo River improvement was approved. From that year, improvement work on the Yodo River began. \n\nDaicho-ji, whose main hall was washed away and precincts devastated (the setting for Chikamatsu Monzaemon's puppet play \"The Love Suicides at Amijima\"), sold its land to Denzaemon Fujita around 1887 (Meiji 20) and relocated to rebuild. On the site where Daicho-ji once stood, Fujita built a residence called the Amijima Palace, which is now the Fujita Art Museum, Fujita Residence Park, Taiko-en, and the Osaka City Guest House. \n\nNearby Sakuranomiya Park has a stone monument commemorating this flood."

                "content": "The Flood of Deucalion is the ancient Greek version of the flood mentioned in the traditions of many ancient civilizations. According to the myth, during the time when Deucalion reigned in Phthia in Thessaly, Zeus decided to destroy the entire generation of humans who were corrupt, except for the just king and his wife, Pyrrha. Deucalion, following his father's advice, built a ship, gathered the necessary supplies for their survival, and boarded the vessel with his wife. Meanwhile, Zeus opened the waterfalls of the heavens, and the land of Greece was filled with water, causing the people to perish. For nine days and nine nights, the royal couple drifted on the waters in the vessel.\n\nOn the tenth day, however, they landed on Mount Othrys or, according to another version, on Mount Parnassus or Mount Athos. There, when the rains stopped and the waters receded, Deucalion and Pyrrha disembarked onto dry land, and the first thing they did was offer a sacrifice to Zeus Phyxios (protector of fugitives). The god, invoked by the pious Deucalion, sent Hermes to convey the promise that Zeus would grant their first wish. And the first wish of Deucalion and Pyrrha was none other than for Zeus to give life to the human race once again. According to another version originating from Phocis, Deucalion and Pyrrha went to Delphi and to the sanctuary of Themis to express the same desire. The goddess heard them and responded with an oracle, telling them that if they wanted to bring new humans to life, they should cover their faces and throw behind their backs the bones of their mother. They understood the interpretation of the oracle, and after doing as instructed, they began throwing stones behind their backs, as these came from the bowels of Mother Earth.\n\nThe stones thrown by Deucalion transformed into men, and those thrown by Pyrrha transformed into women. From the first stone thrown by Deucalion came Hellen, the progenitor of the Greeks. There are other variations of the flood of Deucalion, such as the one stating that it occurred when Ogygus was king in Boeotia, the first king of the land of the Boeotians, or according to the Megarians, only Megarus survived the flood by fleeing to the summit of the Geraneia mountains. Nevertheless, the version of Deucalion and Pyrrha is the one that spread widely and prevailed over all others, and during the time of Plutarch, it was enriched with additional elements and details derived from Asian traditions, bearing many similarities to the version recounted in the Bible."

A large-scale meteorological event, exacerbated by the strong self-regenerating thunderstorm[21]. The meeting of the two airflows, warm air with cold air, is the cause of the V-shape thunderstorm, so called in English for its V shape, and also referred to as self-regenerating. From the analysis of wind data, the southwesterly winds at altitudes above 700 hPa[1] and the southerly winds at 850 hPa[1] in the lower layers (925 and 1000 hPa),[1] it can be understood how the encounter between the cold northern currents of the Tramontana wind from the Po Valley and the warm humid southern currents of the Scirocco wind from the Tyrrhenian Sea resulted in a stationary microfront,[1] that is, a stall caused by the airflow due to the convective motion of the currents. The currents remained blocked over the area, consequently the stormy precipitation self-fed and fell over the same area.[1]"

Tokyo (Edo) is inherently vulnerable to flooding, and as a result of projects like the Tone River eastward diversion, which aimed in part to address flood control, some areas, such as the former Katori Sea region downstream of the Tone River, became prone to flooding as a trade-off. Up until then, flood control, as seen in examples like the Nakajo embankment, was based on the premise of allowing flooding while protecting key areas, and although floods such as the Edo Flood of Kanpo 2 (1742) occurred frequently, they were not considered a major issue. However, after the Meiji Restoration, as modern infrastructure development progressed and the damage costs increased, it became increasingly difficult to gain understanding for such flood control measures based on the premise of flooding, as they imposed further burdens on regions already suffering from flood damage."

Rivers in the Tone, Arakawa, and Tama river systems overflowed extensively, causing levees to collapse in various locations. The damage in the Kanto region included 769 deaths, 78 missing persons, 2,121 houses completely destroyed, and 2,796 houses washed away. Gunma Prefecture, which suffered the most damage, recorded 283 deaths, 27 missing persons, and 1,249 houses completely destroyed or washed away. In addition to the left bank of the Tone River and downstream areas such as Gunma Prefecture, the right bank, which had been thoroughly reinforced after the major eruption of Mount Asama in 1783 (Tenmei 3), also saw the critical Nakajo levee collapse, causing floodwaters to flow through Saitama Prefecture and reach Tokyo Prefecture, leaving the entire Kanto Plain literally submerged. Even in Tokyo, the low-lying areas were flooded for some time, and records show that a relief station (now Asakusa Hospital) was established at Sensoji Temple."

The conflict was between the group, including Shimogō in the Kitakatsushika District and the Minami and Kita Saitama Districts, advocating for reinforced restoration, and the Kamigō area, which demanded the traditional maintenance of the Nakajo embankment along with the construction of embankments on the upper Tone River. The prefectural assembly fell into chaos, and local residents dissatisfied with the mediation proposal presented by the governor clashed violently with the police force, leading to repeated disputes in the prefectural assembly. Ultimately, consideration was given to the demands of the Kamigō area, which had suffered from flood damage, and the height of the Nakajo embankment was maintained as before. For the reinforcement advocated by the Shimogō area, the width of the embankment was expanded, the narrow sections at Sakamaki and Setoi were widened, and the restoration was carried out based on a continuous embankment method. This necessitated revisions to the Tone River improvement project that had already begun, resulting in significant changes such as a review of the planned flood discharge volume and an increase in the diversion volume to the Edo River.\n\nAdditionally, this major flood caused significant damage in Tokyo, with 1.5 million victims, leading the Tokyo Prefecture, which had not previously borne the cost of flood control for the Tone River, to take on local flood control expenses like other prefectures in the basin. Regarding the Arakawa River, a large-scale improvement plan was formulated, and the following year, the Arakawa Floodway project was initiated, involving the excavation of a floodway 500 meters wide and 22 kilometers long from Iwabuchi to the Nakagawa River mouth. Although the project faced extreme difficulties due to the economic downturn caused by World War I and the Great Kanto Earthquake, it was completed in 1930 (Showa 5) with the mobilization of a total of 3.1 million workers, utilizing steam excavators and dredging ships."

The affected areas were Andorra and the regions through which the Segre River flows, from Lleida to Cerdanya, also causing damage to the Noguera and Llobregat basins. It was especially tragic in Alt Urgell and Baixa Cerdanya. The floods left 14 fatalities, roads cut off, and collapsed bridges. Additionally, they caused a significant economic crisis. The Molina observatory reported figures of 600 liters per m², and in La Seu d'Urgell, 102 liters per m². In Alt Urgell, there were forty isolated villages and thirty collapsed bridges. Neither the Barcelona newspapers nor television reflected the magnitude of the catastrophe, focusing instead on the coverage of Pope John Paul II's visit. The airport of La Seu d'Urgell became the link between the city, the region, and Andorra with the outside world. The airport recorded up to 146 flights between planes and helicopters. In Baixa Cerdanya, the flood swept away the road from La Molina as it passed through Alp. In Martinet, it destroyed five or six houses. In Alt Urgell, the flood left the city of La Seu d'Urgell cut off, collapsing the bridges crossing the Valira and the Palanca bridge. The village that suffered the most damage was Pont de Bar, built in a narrow area near the Segre, which was completely submerged by the floods, forcing its reconstruction far from the old village. Half the village was buried by a mountain landslide, and the water also destroyed many houses; it also swept away the remains of the millennial bridge of Sant Ermengol, which gave the village its name. Years later, the river was channeled as it passed through the Segre River.

An hour later, news arrived from across the region about the abnormal rise of all springs and wells, with mentions of \"water volcanoes.\" Three hours later, the water had already unleashed itself. At Pont de Bar (now Pont de Bar Vell), the doors of the power station were sealed, and at night, the water level suddenly rose by two meters, sweeping away the workers' house, though they were not there at the time. In the evening, given the magnitude of the rise, the Emergency Board was established, coordinated by the City Council of La Seu d'Urgell and other organizations. On November 8th, in the early morning, the Adrall bridge on the Cantó road collapsed, and at 1:45 PM, it was reported that the Oliana reservoir was completely full. Between La Seu d'Urgell and Alàs, the usual width of the Segre River is 30 meters; that day, it was 400 meters wide and exceeded its normal level by five meters, reaching fourteen meters in Organyà. Five people had been isolated since Sunday (the 7th) on a farm in Montferrer; they had to climb onto the roof as the river was eroding the house. The Civil Guard helicopter, which was supposed to come from Zaragoza, did not arrive, but they were eventually rescued, along with one person in Salit, by a second French helicopter mobilized through arrangements by the Mitra in Andorra. A firefighter boat rescued a girl who had climbed a tree in Ponts, and the French helicopter went to La Massana following reports of gas explosions and cars falling into the Valira while fleeing danger. On Monday, information was gathered about blocked roads, isolated towns, and the provision of essential services to the cut-off villages. In the evening, false rumors began circulating about the collapse of a dam in France, and in Oliana, the evacuation of the lower part of the town was ordered. On the 9th, efforts were made to secure raw materials, and an air bridge was established between La Seu d'Urgell airport and Barcelona. Among other actions, patients were evacuated, and medicines and food were delivered. A total of 10 helicopters were operational, with three soldiers equipped with radiotelephones in each village that was cut off from communication. To reach Andorra, alternative routes through the high mountains had to be used, and SAR helicopters evacuated tourists. In Alt Urgell, it was ensured that milk from isolated villages could reach tanker trucks. Some procedures were described as peculiar, such as the Taús hose, used to send milk down the ravine. On Wednesday, rumors circulated about a landslide at Pont de Bar, claiming that if it occurred, it would create a dam that would multiply the effects of the previous floods. As a result, the mountain was studied day and night by geologists. On the 11th, Os de Civís, Taús, Tuixent, and Ossera were still isolated. In Os, a group of forty soldiers cleared paths with picks and shovels. Complaints about the lack of television and political coverage were significant, although on that same day, Jordi Pujol, then president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, visited La Seu d'Urgell. On Friday, a public notice was issued refuting TVE's information about the risk of a landslide at Pont de Bar. The rumors had caused alarm downstream and even reached Lleida. In Balaguer, scenes of panic were experienced, and an evacuation order was issued. The area was declared a disaster zone through Decree-Law 21/1982. In the end, the total number of victims was twelve, although it had been said that in Andorra, there were about fifty."

Tourists who had come to visit the country were trapped in hotels, while the Andorran Fire Service's switchboard was overwhelmed with calls. People climbed onto the roofs of supermarkets (such as Hiper Andorra), and citizens had to be rescued with the help of tractors. Santa Coloma (parish of Andorra la Vella) was flooded. The road to Arinsal (parish of La Massana) was closed because the Andorgaz gas station had just exploded. An immediate evacuation order was issued for all buildings within 500 meters of the gas station. The country took a week to return to normal. Days after the events, there were still 1,800 tourists stranded in hotels waiting to be rescued. The disaster led to a surge in insurance claims after the floods. Policies multiplied, as did insurance companies. The country's first government, which was in the midst of transitioning to a Constitution, had to improvise. The head of government, Òscar Ribas, was caught off guard by the tragedy. While it was pouring rain in Andorra, he was in Geneva on an official trip. He was immediately informed of the chaos. It was the first time Andorra had a government and faced such a catastrophe. Poor planning in previous years regarding construction was one of the causes of the floods' severity. The headquarters of the local councils (casa comuna) were used as \"control and coordination centers.\" The water swept away the headquarters of the Encamp council. Despite this, some citizens blamed the government and the councils for poor management. After all, four days later, Arinsal (La Massana) was still cut off. The situation fostered solidarity among the population. Everyone, to some extent, tried to help each other. Antoni Aleix, the police chief at the time, recalls that \"looting in shops was minimal.\" It was an unprecedented situation. The head of government stayed in contact with ministers and the police until two in the morning. The Swiss Red Cross arranged a flight to Barcelona so the head of government could return to the country. Once in Barcelona, he took a helicopter. Four days after the flood, the helicopter service between Andorra and La Seu d'Urgell was suspended, and a forest track was opened as a precarious communication route. Some shopping centers offered water-damaged products at reduced prices for a long time. The situation caused by the floods raised concerns about theft. Some people took advantage of the situation, and at first, bottles of water were sold for more than double the normal price. The Central Park (Andorra la Vella) was flooded. The situation was one of hysteria and anguish, according to Jaume Bartumeu (former head of government). According to government estimates at the time, the reconstruction of damages and losses cost more than 1,000 million pesetas. Andorran schools, especially the Lycée Comte de Foix, took a long time to return to normal. The country observed several days of mourning."

The affected areas were Andorra and the regions through which the Segre River passes, from Lleida to Cerdanya, also causing damage to the basins of the Noguera and Llobregat rivers. It was especially tragic in Alt Urgell and Baixa Cerdanya. The floods left 14 fatalities, roads cut off, and collapsed bridges. Additionally, they caused a significant economic crisis. The Molina observatory recorded figures of 600 liters per m², and in La Seu d'Urgell, 102 liters per m². In Alt Urgell, there were forty isolated villages and thirty collapsed bridges. Neither the Barcelona newspapers nor television reflected the magnitude of the catastrophe, focusing instead on the coverage of Pope John Paul II's visit. The airport of La Seu d'Urgell became the link between the city, the region, and Andorra with the outside world. The airport registered up to 146 flights between planes and helicopters. In Baixa Cerdanya, the flood swept away the road from La Molina as it passed through Alp. In Martinet, it destroyed five or six houses. In Alt Urgell, the flood left the city of La Seu d'Urgell cut off, collapsing the bridges crossing the Valira and the Palanca bridge. The village with the most destruction was Pont de Bar, built in a narrow area near the Segre, which was completely submerged by the floods, forcing its reconstruction far from the old village. Half the village was buried by a mountain landslide, and the water also destroyed many houses; it also swept away the remains of the millennial bridge of Sant Ermengol, which gave the village its name. Years later, the river was channeled as it passed through the Segre River. In 2007, 25 years later, a plaque was placed in memory of the victims at the entrance of the Parc Olímpic del Segre, on the steps of the tannery. On the plaque, it is written, \"Such a great deluge of water came...\""

Floodwaters from the Kajikawa combined with overflow from Fukushima Swamp, causing prolonged inundation of nearby low-lying wetlands. The drainage at the Araigou River drainage pump station could not keep up, leading to the opening of the levee of the Aganogawa River for drainage, which was completed on August 4, 19 days later. Floodwaters on the right bank of the Kajikawa flowed toward the Ochibori River and inundated the remains of the Shiunjigata. On August 28 of the following year, 1967 (Showa 42), the Uetsu Flood (8/28 Flood, Uetsu Heavy Rain) occurred in the Kaetsu region and Yamagata Prefecture.

On the other hand, the climate in Santa Fe is temperate without a dry season, according to the Köppen climate classification, with annual rainfall between 800 and 1100 mm, approximately half of which occurs between February and May.

                "content": "Faced with the challenges of the water situation, the government has built a series of defenses to prevent floods and inundations. The first and most primitive of these is the defense embankment or lateral dike, an artificial earth barrier located on the riverbanks, separating the rivers from flood-prone areas. To prevent water accumulation, as it cannot flow back into the rivers due to the embankments, a set of river defense structures has been implemented, forming drainage works consisting of storm drains, pipes, and rainwater drains. This system channels water to reservoirs, areas adjacent to the embankments, which are depressed zones whose main function is to temporarily store water and later discharge it into nearby natural water currents. This discharge occurs in two ways: by gravity and by pumping. Gravity discharge is achieved through gates in the embankments that connect the reservoirs at their lowest point with a higher point in a water current. On the other hand, the pumping system operates through plants equipped with motor pumps capable of expelling water outside the defenses. By 2007, there were four pumping stations, known as pump houses, in operation, with two more lacking electrical connections. Pump house No. 1 was operating at 65% capacity, with two of its five pumps out of service; No. 3 was operating at 65%, and No. 4 at 80%. In pump house No. 2, on March 14, an explosion occurred in one of the two pumps, which, at the time of the flood's onset, had not yet been repaired. By then, 27 of the 45 available pumps were not functioning, representing 60% of the pumping system."

                "content": "On April 20, 2005, the Justicialist mayor Martín Balbarrey, elected in 2003, presented the Contingency Plan for the city, detailing all the mechanisms to prevent crisis situations like the 2003 flood, with the aim of ensuring that every resident knew how to act in an emergency. The plan was prepared by official organizations and NGOs, along with neighborhood associations and specialists on the subject, and was directed by Venezuelan Pedro Zuccarini, a disaster specialist who had been assisting the city since the 2003 flood on behalf of the German Red Cross. The plan established action protocols for organizations and institutions, the dissemination of necessary knowledge among the population to know how to react, and the creation of the Risk Action Office, prepared to act before, during, and after a disaster. A year later, on March 20, 2006, Balbarrey ordered the creation of the Risk Management Subsecretariat, under the Secretariat of Water Resources, appointing Pedro Zuccarini as its head. In June 2006, Proyecto Santa Fe, a study center led by then-national Radical deputy Hugo Storero, conducted a survey of 360 people and 56 institutions in twelve neighborhoods in the west, the area most affected by the 2003 flood. According to the results, most people would not know what to do in the event of another flood, being unaware of the new Contingency Plan and the location of evacuation centers, although Zuccarini later denied the survey, claiming that \"two out of five Santa Fe residents\" knew the plan and were prepared. Another finding of the survey was that a majority of the institutions did not believe another flood was possible. Zuccarini traveled to his home country, Venezuela, in December 2006, initially for personal reasons and later, according to Balbarrey, to present the projects implemented in Santa Fe to other parts of the world. By February 1, 2007, he had not returned, leading to his suspension without pay, and he was ultimately removed from his position on February 21. The nine-person team of the subsecretariat continued working, divided into two groups, one in charge of fieldwork and the other of logistics. This occurred in the context of the Paraná River's rise in February 2007, which affected the residents of Vuelta del Paraguayo."

The flood was not as destructive as the \"Storofsen\" in 1789, but the water level in many places was higher or close to it. According to NVE, the flood had a volume 3-4 times that of Storofsen in parts of the Glomma River. At least twelve people are reported to have lost their lives. The flood may have been on the level of a 500-year flood. The flood occurred as a result of unusually large amounts of snow in the mountains during the winter of 1859/1860. When the snowmelt was at its peak, large amounts of rain also fell, leading to extreme flooding and widespread inundations in many parts of Eastern Norway. In this way, it resembled the \"Vesleofsen\" in 1995, while Storofsen was more of a rain flood. Buskerud was particularly badly affected, with loss of human lives, livestock, and bridges. Parts of Sweden also experienced major flooding. The Faluån River destroyed a large part of the buildings along its banks, and the water level in Lake Siljan rose to 3 meters above normal."

                "content": "Starting on September 8, 1899, heavy rainfall occurred in southern Bavaria. The rain originated from a large-scale low-pressure system that extended from North Africa to the Baltic region and from the Western Alps to the Black Sea. The transport of moist air from the north as well as from the entire Mediterranean region produced precipitation of over 500 mm at its peak across an area of more than 10,000 square kilometers. In the Isar region up to the Loisach estuary, the rainfall between September 9 and 14 averaged 400 mm, resulting in 990 million cubic meters of runoff from the 2,736 square kilometer area. Due to a relatively dry summer and a snow-poor winter in 1898/99, underground reservoirs were at a low water level, allowing parts of the rainwater to be naturally absorbed. Otherwise, the subsequent flooding would have been even more severe. Nevertheless, the rainfall led to flooding, especially in the Isar and Inn regions, by September 14. Other areas in the Alpine foothills were similarly affected, such as along the Danube and the Traun. Unlike the floods of 1954 and 2002, no double wave (resulting from separately discharged rainfall blocks) occurred in 1899, but rather a continuous, single wave. The water levels reached in 1899 were the highest ever recorded in the Isar and Inn regions."

Particularly affected were the riverbank fortifications and weirs, such as the Neumüller and Montgelas dams. The young Maximilian facilities were also severely damaged. In these areas, as well as in the Isar floodplains, constructed ponds and lakes were destroyed. The Maximilianswerk hydroelectric power plant, built only in 1895, was also affected. All Isar bridges were damaged, with two collapsing. In addition to three wooden bridges, there were eight stone and two iron bridges in the city area before the flood. On September 13, the Max-Joseph Bridge (also called the Bogenhausen Bridge), a bridge built in 1876 in iron truss architecture, collapsed. The date is noteworthy, as on another September 13 during the flood of 1813, the Munich Swan Bridge (today: Ludwigs Bridge) near the present-day Museum Island also collapsed, resulting in the drowning of 100 people. After the piers of the Luitpold Bridge (also called the Prinzregenten Bridge) had already been undermined by the floodwaters for days, with significant amounts of soil at the abutments and parts of the riverbank protections washed away, it too collapsed into the Isar the following day. This steel bridge, built in a segmental arch design, had been constructed only eight years earlier. At approximately its location, the riverbed of the Isar widened from 45 to 65 meters during the flood due to bank erosion. No fatalities from the flood are known."

The destroyed Max-Joseph Bridge was replaced by an emergency bridge after the onset of winter. As a result of the destruction, the city administration decided on an extensive construction and renovation program, which between 1900 and 1905 included fundamental river regulation within the city area, the construction of extensive embankments and quay walls, as well as the renovation (profile expansion for greater water flow) or new construction of six bridges. In March 1901, the city council decided to announce a limited competition for the expansion and new construction of the bridges. The extensive new construction program included, in addition to the creation of six new Isar bridges in stone and (partially) concrete construction (Luitpold Bridge – 1901, Max-Joseph Bridge – 1902, Cornelius Bridge – 1903, Reichenbach Bridge – 1903, Wittelsbacher Bridge – 1904, and Outer Maximilian Bridge – 1905), a reorganization of the Isar area (almost continuously over a length of about 6 kilometers between the Thalkirchen rapids and the Prater weir) with regulation by enclosing the river with quay walls and dams. For cost reasons, the new bridges were constructed with a standard scaffolding and made of solid shell limestone blocks (from quarries in Lower Franconia), which is why they look similar in form with their wide-spanning bridge arches and are identical in material. The bridges were built by the construction company Sager & Woerner, and the designs were created by the architects Friedrich von Thiersch and Theodor Fischer. The previously regularly flooded Coal Island (today: Museum Island) was also fortified in such a way that it was now flood-proof."

The most affected areas were Baix Llobregat, Empordà, and Penedès. The highest rainfall occurred on the 28th in Baix Llobregat with 262.0 mm in St. Feliu de Llobregat and 153.8 mm in Esplugues de Llobregat, and in Alt Penedès with 105.5 mm at the Foix Reservoir. On the 29th, the maximum values were recorded in Baix Empordà with 192.3 mm in Lladó, 181.0 mm in Peralada, and 150.6 mm in Empúries. Throughout the meteorological episode, the highlights were the 262.0 mm in St. Feliu de Llobregat and the 202.6 mm in Lladó. During those days, there was a marked surface flow, between the east and southeast, driven by a deep storm system located over Galicia with a secondary core off the coast of Algeria. Additionally, at higher altitudes, there was significant wind shear: southwest at 500 hPa, south at 850 hPa, and southeast at the surface. In general, this configuration is typically very unstable and leads to the advection of warm and very humid air into Catalonia, favoring the development of significant storms with heavy rainfall along the coast and pre-coastal areas, as occurred between September 28 and 29, 1913. Due to the large amount of rainfall, the Foix, Anoia, Cardener, Llobregat, Ripoll, Congost, Besòs, Muga, Manol, Llobregat d'Empordà, and numerous streams in Penedès, Garraf, Baix Llobregat, Barcelonès, and Empordà overflowed, causing significant damage in many places. Regarding the damage, the violent overflow of the Riera de la Salut in St. Feliu de Llobregat broke the walls of the municipal cemetery, dragging many coffins into the Llobregat River. In Vendrell, the Torrent del Lluc swept away the railway bridge, and in Cubelles, the Foix destroyed another bridge. Finally, in Empordà, all the bridges on the road from Roses to Vilajuïga collapsed due to the significant overflows of the various streams crossing that road. The consequences of this flood were visible for a long time, leaving a significant mark on the memory of the inhabitants of all the affected regions."

In Montblanc, 8 people drowned, and the force of the water carried away eleven houses, several mills, and the railway bridge. In Vilaverd, the current also swept away the railway bridge. In the Riba gorge, where the Brugent and Francolí rivers converge, the flood destroyed numerous houses and paper mills and caused fatalities. The streams running near the city of Valls also experienced surges, causing the collapse of walls and some houses. Two people were reported missing there. In the Valls area, the Francolí's surge spared the Goi bridge, a medieval-era construction. In the following days, in the areas of Rourell, Morell, Pobla de Mafumet, and Puigdelfí, numerous bodies carried away by the water were recovered. In Tarragona, it was the eve of the Santa Tecla Festival. Torrential rain fell from one to six in the morning. Around half-past two at night, the Francolí River overflowed, flooding nearby fields and demolishing an old wooden bridge and the iron bridges of the two railway lines (the Reus and Lleida line, and the Tortosa and Valencia line). The water entered the city and flooded the lower neighborhoods, causing severe damage. In the following days, numerous bodies carried away by the flood were found on the beaches and in the orchards along the Francolí River. The Gaià River also experienced a significant surge. In its upper course, the flood destroyed numerous houses in Pontils and those in the lower part of Santa Perpètua. The surge caused considerable damage along its entire course, leading to a severe flood in the Altafulla area, where it demolished the railway bridge. In Baix Camp, the streams also overflowed, destroying buildings in towns such as Reus, Riudoms, Cambrils, and Mont-roig.

The flood occurred at dawn, catching people inside their homes. Within the town, the water rose through the streets until it reached Sant Antoni Square. In the rest of Urgell, the Corb River also experienced a significant rise, causing destruction as it passed through Guimerà (35 deaths). In Tarròs, the water destroyed almost all the houses, causing 8 deaths. In Vilagrassa, 13 fatalities were recorded, and in Claravalls, 11. The downpour also swept away a section of the railway line between Tàrrega and Bellpuig and the bridge over the Vilagrassa stream. Between Bellpuig and Belianes, a small settlement, Eixaders, also disappeared. Near Agramunt, the Sió River carried away the aqueduct bridge, built in 1857, where the Urgell canal crossed elevated above the river. The waters, carrying all kinds of debris, blocked the arches, causing the river level to exceed 9 meters; the water flowed over the bridge and formed a large waterfall until the structure gave way.

In the early morning, the most affected regions were Priorat, Baix and Alt Camp, and Tarragonès. In the afternoon, the heavy rains intensified in the regions of Montsià and Baix Ebre, in the southern part of the province. The heavy rains and the increase in river flow triggered Alert G – very heavy rains – across the entire province. The most affected areas were along the Francolí River, from its source in l'Espluga de Francolí to its mouth near the maritime district of Tarragona – El Serrallo. In some places, the river reached up to three meters in height, surpassing the height of some bridges and causing the collapse of five, such as in the town of la Riba, where the confluence of the Francolí and Brugent rivers caused a flood that destroyed the access bridge to the town. The PLASEQTA – Tarragona Chemical Industry Safety Plan – was also activated due to the collapse of the bridge providing access to the refinery and the municipalities of la Pobla de Mafumet and el Morell via the Valls road. The river's force caused the rupture of two pipelines in the rack transporting various chemical substances, leading to the spillage of these toxic products into the sea. In Reus, the PEM – Municipal Emergency Plan – was activated early in the morning, as most communication routes were cut off. Some flooding occurred – at the Casal de Sant Josep Obrer and Hall 4 of the Fira – the students of the Bon Soleil School (currently Collège Français de Reus) were evacuated, and two houses collapsed, but no personal injuries were reported. Water flowed with great force through all the streams, torrents, and ravines of many towns in Tarragona, but the streams of Alforja and Maspujols caused the most damage in Baix Camp. In Priorat, the need to open the gates of the Siurana reservoir increased the river flow and caused severe flooding in Porrera, which had to be partially evacuated. Power outages occurred – eight high-voltage towers fell in various municipalities – as well as disruptions to telephone, gas, train, and road services. The most significant evacuations took place in the maritime district of Tarragona – El Serrallo – and in Porrera and Poboleda in the Priorat region. Other municipalities were cut off due to the floods. Throughout the day, according to information from the delegate of the Generalitat Government, Josep Maldonado, and the civil governor, Ramón Sánchez, a total of 850 civil guards, 200 national police officers, 12 civil protection members, 80 Mossos d'Esquadra, 160 firefighters, and 4 firefighter helicopters were deployed to assist with evacuation tasks, along with personnel from various local police forces in the affected municipalities and road staff. The damage caused by the flood to the Generalitat's roads and bridges was estimated at 5,000 million pesetas, to which the regional administration added 2,000 million in damages to hydraulic works. The MOPTMA estimated losses of 1,598 million in roads and bridges under its jurisdiction, mostly in the province of Tarragona, along with the loss of construction machinery from the Tarragona park, valued at 325 million. The Tarragona Provincial Council, for its part, estimated damages to the local road network at 1,000 million pesetas."

The most affected areas in 1983 were the regions of Baix Llobregat, Barcelonès, and the eastern and western Vallesos, although in parts of Cerdanya, Garrotxa, and Osona, the total precipitation of the entire episode was also significant."

The spatial distribution of the rain that morning was very irregular; for example, 217.3 mm fell in L'Hospitalet, 56 mm in Cornellà, and only 16 mm at the mouth of the Besòs. Precipitation continued to fall more moderately for the rest of the 7th and much of the 8th. The last showers, more localized, lasted until midday on November 9.[1] The maximum 24-hour precipitation values occurred on the 7th, exceeding 200 mm in parts of Vallès Occidental and Barcelonès. In Terrassa, 313.0 mm fell, and in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 249.1 mm fell over approximately 28 hours (from 03 UTC on 07/11/1983 to 07 UTC on 08/11/1983). Of the accumulated values during the episode (from 07 UTC on 06/11/1983 to 07 UTC on 09/11/1983), notable amounts include 333.0 mm in Terrassa, 254.8 mm in La Molina, and 252.8 mm in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat.[1] The meteorological situation during the episode was characterized by a strong surface storm from the southeast, caused by the passage of a deep disturbance present at all levels of the troposphere. This depression moved from the Gulf of Cádiz in the early hours of November 6 to Sardinia in the early hours of November 8, crossing the Balearic Islands to the south on the 7th. This storm caused a marked flow of humid and warm southeast winds at low levels and southerly winds at high levels, advecting a potentially very unstable air mass at all levels, resulting in the significant downpours of November 7 and 8.[1]"

Notable overflows included the Riera Blanca in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, the Riera de la Païssa in Sant Joan Despí, the Riera de la Salut in Sant Feliu de Llobregat, the Riera de Vallvidrera in Molins de Rei, and the Riera de les Arenes in Terrassa and Rubí. It is also worth noting that many streets in the city of Barcelona turned into torrents of water due to the heavy intensity of the rainfall, flooding basements and garages. This episode of torrential rains had a significant social impact, especially in the riverside towns of Baix Llobregat, as it occurred just one year after the major floods caused by the rains from November 6 to 8, 1982, the damages of which had only recently been repaired, with many improvement works still pending. All of this created a notable sense of helplessness among the entire population."

In the old town of Cambrils and some streets near the stream, such as Immolats del Setge Street, Hospital Street, and Sant Plàcid Street, were flooded. The Eixample area was also partially flooded, especially Santa Joaquima de Vedruna Street and Àngel Guimerà Street. In the port area, Jaume I Boulevard and all the streets leading to the port up to Aragó Square were also flooded. At half-past eleven in the morning, the water level began to recede. Firefighters assisted several people who had been trapped in the water currents."

The streets were filled with debris and mud; specifically, Santa Joaquima de Vedruna Street was heavily affected in the initial section near the stream, which was rendered unusable for a few days, and the underground parking located there was filled to the ceiling with water and mud. A lot of debris floated in the sea, both inside and outside the port. The amount of sediment carried by the flood formed a small delta at its mouth. Likewise, the streambed suffered numerous damages: two collapsed bridges, broken walls, rows of trees swallowed, and collapsed sidewalks. The Maspujols stream also overflowed and caused a partial collapse of the bridge on the road leading to Salou and the destruction of part of the facilities of the Cambrils Beach campsite. In the afternoon, the city council convened an extraordinary meeting in which various alert measures were established in case another eventuality occurred, and it was decided, among other measures, to request the classification of Cambrils as a disaster area. The initial damage assessment estimated the cost at 500 million pesetas, as in addition to the destruction of part of the stream's channeling and the bridges crossing it, there was damage to the road network, electrical installations, potable water pipelines, and the sewage system. The channeling of the stream had to be completely rebuilt, and the opportunity was taken to improve the foundation of the retaining walls in the final section and to cement the last stretch of the streambed to prevent erosion."

As a result, a new outlet of the lagoon was opened, known since then as s'Oberta, and this event prompted the long-proposed project to drain s'Albufera to finally be carried out. At the time, it was estimated that 100 million m³ of water accumulated over s'Albufera, and at the Son Amer estate, the water mark reached 20 spans (4 meters) above the ground, 6 above sea level. The characteristics of the episode correspond to a combination of torrential flows from the headwaters, extreme rainfall over the affected area, and marine phenomena similar to those caused by a storm surge, all exacerbated by an insufficient outlet of s'Albufera."

The Torrent of Búger overflowed, flooding Sa Pobla through Carrer Major. Around the village, near the Muro road, the water reached a meter high (up to the bellies of the animals, according to witnesses). Simultaneously, there was a strong easterly or southeast storm at sea, with very high waves, which prevented the accumulated water and the water running through the torrents of Sant Miquel and Muro from flowing out through the natural outlet of S'Albufera at Els Ponts. Eventually, the enormous amount of water, trapped between S'Albufera and Sa Pobla, broke through a dune barrier, creating a breach 200 paces long and 5 fathoms deep (~260×~4 m.), at the same spot where the Canal Gran now flows out, more than three kilometers from the previous outlet. This allowed the accumulated water to drain. The flood did not cause human casualties, but many animals, especially oxen and mares, perished. The effects were felt as far as Ciutadella, where the red water (aigua roja) from the great flood reached. The ditches, which often served as boundaries between properties, were filled with silt, and it was not possible to identify the limits of rural properties until several days later."

Gelat and his cousin Pere Serra, alias Garrut, who were shepherds by profession, were sent at midnight on the 30th to retrieve the mares grazing in s'Albufera by their owners. On their way back, at the Son Fornari marsh, the flood prevented them from continuing, and to save themselves, they climbed onto a haystack made up of 1,200 bundles of reeds they found at the Hort dels Noguers. They spent 30 hours up there, much of it standing, with water up to their chests and tied to each other with the halters they carried for the animals, until the water receded. The haystack was not moved by the runoff because it was supported by the buttress of a canal and secured with ropes tied to large perforated stones that anchored it. Surviving under such extreme conditions, when everyone thought they were dead, etched the episode into the collective memory of the locals, becoming part of the local collective imagination."

                "content": "The flood in Sochi was a natural disaster that occurred in the city of Sochi and throughout the Sochi and Adler districts of Russia in June 2015, when nearly two months' worth of rainfall fell within a day. As a result of the downpour, the maximum water level in local rivers was exceeded by more than 1.2 meters. The railway station and airport were flooded, and their operations were suspended. The most common explanation for the catastrophic scale of the flood is the malfunctioning storm drainage system, which was \"reconstructed\" during preparations for the Winter Olympics—reconstruction that was mostly done on paper, with funds embezzled. The chief editor of \"BlogSochi,\" Alexander Valov, claims that during the construction of Olympic facilities, many natural water drainage channels, which could have carried away water during heavy rains, were destroyed. Additionally, one of the reasons for the catastrophic flood, he says, was that pumps meant to drain rainwater stopped working due to power outages. Sochi began experiencing flooding in September 2013—during the construction of Olympic facilities—and again in July 2014."

The air was forced to rise at the mountains, which led to prolonged, widespread heavy rainfall starting on October 11. Initially, the Piedmont region was primarily affected, but when the wind direction at the southern edge of the Alps shifted to the northwest on October 13, the rain also reached regions beyond the main Alpine ridge in Valais. The heaviest rainfall occurred on October 13 and 14 in the Domodossola region and at the Simplon Pass, and then from October 14 to 15 in some southern side valleys of Valais. A rainfall maximum of 580 mm was measured at Lago Paione on October 14. On October 16, the cold front moved eastward, and the precipitation subsided."

In addition to immense property damage, there were 23 fatalities, 128 injuries, 11 missing persons, and around 40 homeless individuals. In the upper reaches of the Po, the Pellice Valley was particularly affected by the flooding; in Moncalieri and Turin, city districts near the Po were flooded, with the river at Turin temporarily carrying 2,300 cubic meters of water per second, significantly exceeding the severe flood of 1994. It was the largest flood in Turin since 1839. During the flood, bridges over the Orco collapsed at Noasca and Bardonetto, the bridge over the Stura at Robassomero, a railway bridge at Ivrea (Settimo Vittone), and additional road bridges in the Canavese were destroyed by the water. In the Po plain below Turin, the side dikes of the Po broke in several places, and numerous towns were flooded; the flood zone extended downstream to an area in Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna."

The lake flooding was due to the strong inflow of the Toce in Italy, in whose catchment area a rain center was located. In contrast, the Maggia and the Ticino did not bring any unusual floods to the lake. On October 14, the lake overflowed its banks and slowly flooded the old town of Locarno. By October 17, the water kept rising and eventually reached a record level that had not been measured in the 20th century. The flooding of Lake Maggiore affected not only Locarno in Ticino but also residential and commercial areas, sports facilities, public buildings, wastewater treatment plants, and clinics in the municipalities of Ascona, Brissago, Gordola, Minusio, Muralto, Tenero-Contra, and Gambarogno. It was only on October 25 that the water had flowed from Sesto Calende into the Ticino River towards the Po, allowing the lake to retreat back into its normal basin."

The rain led to the most severe flooding in Valais in the 20th century. On October 14 and 15, numerous streams and rivers in the canton overflowed their banks, large areas were flooded, debris flows destroyed numerous houses and buried villages and transport infrastructure. Sixteen people lost their lives in Valais due to the event. Near Stalden-Neubrück, a debris flow destroyed five buildings and disrupted the cantonal road and the Brig-Visp-Zermatt railway line; the Vispa, which was dammed by the debris flow, flooded the Stalden wastewater treatment plant. Below Zermatt, a lake formed due to a debris flow, submerging several buildings. The BVZ railway line between Brig and Zermatt was interrupted in several places and could only be reopened after 24 days. Debris flows destroyed houses and disrupted transport routes in Mörel, the Binntal, Naters, and Baltschieder. In Baltschieder, the Baltschiederbach flooded a settlement area of 733,000 square meters, leaving debris deposits up to four meters high in the upper part of the village, while water and electricity supplies as well as telephone lines were destroyed. Between Brig-Glis and Visp, the Gamsa flowed onto the construction site of the A9 motorway and over the railway lines of the SBB and BVZ. As a secondary consequence of the heavy rainfall in Upper Valais, severe flooding occurred in Lower Valais. In Sion, the Vissingen Canal overflowed its banks and flooded a commercial district. Near Chamoson, the right bank of the Rhone levee broke, exposing the gas pipeline of the Gazoduc du Rhône, which lay unprotected above ground. Through the breach in the levee, water flowed into the Rhone plain, washing debris and mud onto agricultural land. A levee on the canal from Sion to Riddes also broke, and water overflowed from the canal from Leytron to Fully. The commercial district of Saillon, with several wineries, was flooded. In total, 1,027 hectares in the Rhone plain were eventually under water during the event."

It spanned a large horizontal area, with a vertical thickness of several kilometers throughout the troposphere. A low-pressure field formed over the Adriatic when cold and moist polar air penetrated the Mediterranean region. This polar front collided with a moist subtropical front, leading to the formation of very low pressure. During May 14, the cyclonic field moved towards the Balkans and \"stagnated\" over the areas of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The air mass saturation was around 100%, and humidity increased due to warm air from the south and east. The development of such a low-pressure field was also favored by the physical-geographical specificity of the Balkan Peninsula. The center of the cyclonic field was over Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where between May 13 and 15, a large amount of precipitation was recorded, the highest ever recorded since meteorological observations began. The weakening and disappearance of the cyclone began on May 16 and concluded on May 18."

Only the northern part of the island-continent, which is already in the intertropical zone, as well as the southeastern mountains (Australian Alps), have a somewhat wetter climate. The Murray River, in turn, has an irregular flow regime and relatively low water volume, which is due to its long course through arid climate regions. Thus, although the Murray River with its tributaries (Darling, Murrumbidgee, and others) constitutes the largest river system in Australia, with more than one million km², its economic benefits for agriculture, industry, and potable water supply are not well developed, and there are possibilities to increase them through comprehensive basin planning. The Murray is a river that experiences strong floods and long periods of low water levels, so more multipurpose dams (hydroelectric, irrigation, flood control, and others) need to be built, infrastructure works need to be carried out to prevent damage in populations located mainly on the right bank of the river from the confluence with the Darling to the mouth, and areas with insufficient drainage (which in Australia are called billabongs and correspond in Spanish to terms such as abandoned meanders, oxbow lakes, marshes, or sporadically flooded areas, etc.) need to be channeled."

                "header": "Asymmetry of the Murray River basin",
                "content": "When discussing the floods in the Australian Murray River basin, it should be noted that, as it is located in the southern hemisphere, any moving body, such as river water, tends to veer to the right, that is, opposite to the northern hemisphere. However, this deviation is not real but apparent, as it is not the river water that veers to the right but the Earth's surface that rotates from right to left (east to west), that is, counterclockwise. This means that, in a moving body with a constant direction (such as the Foucault pendulum), the apparent deviation would occur from left to right, or in other words, clockwise, for the simple reason that the pendulum's base, that is, the Earth's surface, rotates in the opposite direction (counterclockwise). This is why almost all the cities affected by the 1956 floods in the Murray basin were located on the river's right bank. Among the flooded cities at that time, we can mention, including their location on Google Maps: Colignan, Iraak, which no longer exists and was replaced by a lake that is now almost dried up, Mannum, Murray Bridge, Mildura, Nangiloc, whose name is written backward compared to Colignan, Red Cliffs, Renmark, Wentworth, and others. All the mentioned towns are situated on the right bank of the Murray River (except for a couple of cases where the town is divided in two by the river itself, as in Murray Bridge, although this is an exception that proves the rule because the force of the flood affected the part of the city on the right bank). The case of Iraak, which is somewhat separated from the Murray River and is now almost uninhabited, is due to the fact that it was originally a military camp during World War II (it also held prisoners), and during the 1956 floods, it was flooded, creating a lake that still exists: on one hand, the location of the place was precarious and risky and was only justified by its temporary use as a military zone. On the other hand, the floods of that year highlighted the risk of that location and worsened the initial problem: it was probably easier to dismantle the camp and relocate than to carry out infrastructure works to minimize or eliminate the risks of that location. The Google Earth program is very useful for assessing the flood risk of any location in Australia (or anywhere) since by moving the cursor over the satellite image, we automatically get the elevation in meters above sea level of any point, which can indicate how frequent a situation is where the natural levees of a river are at a higher elevation than the surrounding plain, which is precisely why it is called a floodplain. In the specific case of Wentworth, which is located on the right bank of the Darling River at its confluence with the Murray, the main reason for the flooding was not directly due to the rise of this river but because this rise dammed the waters of the Darling upstream of the confluence, overflowing to the north of the town, which was almost completely flooded for some time. In a desert or semi-desert climate, most rivers are allochthonous and can experience massive floods due to irregular rainfall, which can be very scarce for years but also very intense and disastrous on some sporadic occasions, exacerbated by the fact that the large amount of sediment carried by the river waters (due to the sparse vegetation cover in a dry climate) tends to raise the riverbed and natural levees, especially the left one, in the case of the Murray River because we are in the southern hemisphere. This is why most of the floods caused by the river's overflow occurred on its right bank."

It is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn in the northern part of the country, which gives this area an intertropical climate (savanna, rainforest in some places, and especially a dry subtropical climate). Most of the territory has a desert or semi-desert climate (Australia's deserts cover more than 2 million km²), and oceanic influences are very powerful, giving rise to tropical and extratropical storms, often very intense. In the specific case of Australia, the relatively dry climate makes it irregular, with years and even decades of very scarce rainfall and brief periods (weeks or months) of extraordinarily intense rains. In 1956, a rainy period lasting a little over three months was recorded, resulting in a massive flood that reached its highest point in Morgan, South Australia, at 12.3 meters, and these floods were felt up to 100 km away from the riverbanks. In the specific case of Morgan, its location on the right bank of the river (as with the previously mentioned towns) is compounded by being situated on a 90° left bend of the Murray River, which concentrated the effects of the flood due to the natural right levee being lower than the left one in the southern hemisphere, so the centrifugal force of the river's flow at the bend was directed toward the location of this town. This location can be seen on Google Maps: Morgan, South Australia."

The water level reached a little over two meters, and the city remained flooded for five years, from September 1629 to 1634. Of the 20,000 Spanish families living in the city at that time, only 400 remained.

Facing recurrent floods, the Mexica developed systems to control rising waters, such as retaining walls and aqueducts. With the implemented systems, they were not only able to supply themselves with clean water for consumption but also managed to prevent flooding. The Spanish, despite being aware of the existing soil subsidence problems in Tenochtitlan, decided to establish the capital of New Spain there for political reasons. In addition to the geographical location, other changes resulted in the rise of water levels: environmental changes, deforestation, and the expansion of crops that led to soil erosion. All of this contributed to the city flooding on several occasions."

When the viceroy realized that this was only preventing the water from flowing out, he ordered the drainage to be uncovered, but it was too late.  \nThe city was submerged, many houses collapsed, others were flooded, and their inhabitants could only stay on the second floor. The unsanitary conditions, scarcity, and disease that followed the flood caused the death of approximately 30,000 people in the following years. The flood also caused many people to emigrate from the city, mostly settling in the city of Puebla. The viceroy wanted to prevent more people from leaving and took several measures to provide people with confidence and reassurance that the situation would improve."

Canoes were also used for transportation within the city. To prevent more houses from collapsing, it was ordered that each homeowner build a type of wall attached to their house to prevent the foundations from weakening.\n\nThe measures taken to alleviate the situation were not enough; it was also necessary to remove the water from the city.

Given the situation and the lack of a short-term solution, the viceroy proposed to the city council the option of relocating the capital to another city. However, the city council responded that it would cost more money to move the capital than to rebuild it. It was decided that the only viable solution would be to find an effective drainage system. In 1634, the Carmelite friar and architect Andrés de San Miguel, commissioned by the viceroy, corrected the drainage channel of Mexico City, which had been built by Enrico Martínez, allowing the water to flow out of the city and enabling its reconstruction."

                "content": "Typhoon No. 18, which occurred on September 7, made landfall in the Tokai region on September 9 and later became an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan that night. Although the direct damage caused by this typhoon was not significant, warm, moist air flowed in from the Pacific Ocean due to the extratropical cyclone that had transformed from the typhoon moving northeast over the Sea of Japan. This collided with moist winds blowing in from Typhoon No. 17, which was approaching the Japanese archipelago from the sea east of Japan, resulting in the continuous formation of rain clouds (linear precipitation bands) stretching north to south. This caused heavy rainfall exceeding 300 mm in 24 hours, primarily in northern Kanto and southern Tohoku, leading to extensive damage.\n\nOn September 9, heavy rain centered in northern Kanto occurred, and according to AMeDAS observation data from midnight on September 7 to 5 p.m. on September 10, 24-hour rainfall by the morning of the 10th reached 551.0 mm in Nikko City, Ikari, Tochigi Prefecture, and 541.0 mm in Nikko City, Imaichi, with over 300 mm observed in various locations within Tochigi Prefecture. Additionally, total rainfall during the period was 645.5 mm in Imaichi, 622.0 mm in Ikari, 561.5 mm in Tōrobu, and 523.0 mm in Kanuma, with over 400 mm observed in various locations in Tochigi Prefecture. At 12:20 a.m. on September 10, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rain warning for the entire Tochigi Prefecture, and at 7:45 a.m., a similar warning was issued for almost all of Ibaraki Prefecture. In these regions, maximum caution was urged against river flooding, landslides, and inundation of low-lying areas, while surrounding prefectures were also called upon to exercise strict caution.\n\nThe area of rainfall gradually shifted to the Tohoku region, and at 3:20 a.m. on September 11, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rain warning for Miyagi Prefecture. The special heavy rain warnings issued for each prefecture were lifted at 6 a.m. on the 11th in Tochigi Prefecture, at 8:15 a.m. in Ibaraki Prefecture, and at 7:30 p.m. in Miyagi Prefecture. On September 18, the Japan Meteorological Agency named the heavy rain and the resulting disaster that struck the Kanto and Tohoku regions as the \"September 2015 Kanto-Tohoku Heavy Rain.\" Additionally, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan created a special page on its official website titled \"September 2015 Kanto-Tohoku Heavy Rain,\" providing information on the disaster using data such as topographic maps and aerial photographs.\n\nOn October 6, the government decided in a cabinet meeting to designate the agricultural damage caused by the disaster as a \"severe disaster\" under the Act on Special Financial Assistance for Coping with Severe Disasters, and to designate specific areas in Minamiaizu Town, Minamiaizu District, and Showa Village, Onuma District, in Fukushima Prefecture as \"localized severe disaster areas.\" This decision was promulgated and enforced on October 7. As a result, the proportion of costs subsidized by the national government for restoration work on farmland and agricultural facilities carried out by local governments was raised to a maximum of approximately 90%.\n\nThe heavy rain in Tochigi Prefecture and flooding in Ibaraki Prefecture were compared to Typhoon No. 4 in 1998. While Typhoon No. 4 in 1998 recorded torrential rain and over 1,000 mm of precipitation, the Kanto-Tohoku Heavy Rain had a total rainfall of about 600 mm, with hourly rainfall of 50–70 mm (no record-breaking short-term heavy rain information was issued during the period)."

Additionally, there were 82 injured nationwide, 81 houses completely destroyed, 7,090 partially destroyed, 384 partially damaged, 2,523 flooded above floor level, 13,259 flooded below floor level, and 1,722 non-residential buildings damaged. It was also confirmed that breaches, overflows, leaks, flooding, and damage or collapse of embankment slopes occurred in five rivers managed by the national government and 80 rivers managed by prefectures. According to the tally announced at 5:00 PM on September 13, evacuation orders were issued to approximately 240,000 people in one metropolitan area and 19 prefectures from Iwate Prefecture to Kagawa Prefecture since September 8, and evacuation advisories were issued to approximately 3.15 million people.

As a result, a wide area of Joso City, sandwiched between the Kinugawa and Kokaigawa Rivers, was submerged, causing significant damage, including 2 direct fatalities, 12 disaster-related deaths, and over 40 injuries. Additionally, the Joso City Hall main building, which had just been completed in 2014 incorporating lessons from the Great East Japan Earthquake, was flooded, and more than 5,000 houses were partially or completely destroyed. In response to this incident, Joso City established a verification committee and compiled a report. \n\nFurthermore, at Tokyo Electric Power's Kinugawa Power Plant (Nikko City), Doyahara Power Plant (Shioya Town), and Akagawa Power Plant (Nasushiobara City), generators were submerged, and facilities were damaged, leading to a halt in power generation. Additionally, a landslide caused a transmission tower to tilt and break, cutting off power supply to the Yagan Railway Aizu Kinugawa Line, resulting in the suspension of operations on that line. Moreover, at Kinugawa Onsen in Nikko City, Tochigi Prefecture, an open-air bath of a hotel facing the Kinugawa River collapsed.\n\nTochigi City Riheya Elementary School and Oyama City Hanegawa Nishi Elementary School in Tochigi Prefecture announced plans to resume classes by borrowing vacant classrooms from other schools after their school buildings and gymnasiums were submerged by the flood. The second semester closing ceremony was held in hallways and music rooms as the gymnasium was under renovation and unavailable. In March 2016, the renovation of Hanegawa Nishi Elementary School's gymnasium was completed, and a reconstruction ceremony was held on March 9.\n\nAt Oyama Driving School, facilities and vehicles suffered damage, with 14 out of 18 vehicles submerged, leading to a suspension of operations.

As with other similar disasters in the area, such as the 1953 Netherlands flood, the phenomenon occurred due to the conjunction of a spring tide and a storm with low atmospheric pressure. The most severe consequences took place in Frisia, with around 50,000 direct deaths. The alteration of the terrain was such that a new sea, the Zuiderzee, was even created, which had previously been a freshwater lake, the Flevo. The force of the tide collapsed the dunes that separated it from open waters, thus creating a new oceanic inlet. Dozens of settlements disappeared under the waves, new ports were created, and the need for more protection systems for coastal areas became evident, as the dike system installed in West Frisia saved much of this region. The flood was also strongly felt in the British Isles, where the storm and waves buried entire villages. Some commercial ports, such as Dunwich, disappeared, causing significant economic losses. In the medium term, the flood contributed to migratory waves of people who no longer felt safe in coastal areas and in the newly created peatlands or who had lost everything and sought ways to make a living in inland cities. It also affected the linguistic distribution of Frisian, which saw its area of influence reduced due to the mortal victims and population movements. Due to all this impact, the St. Lucia flood is considered the fifth most significant in recorded history, both for the high number of victims and for its consequences on the landscape, economy, language, and demography over time."

On February 28, 1830, drifting ice formed an ice jam near Stadlau, which broke during the night of March 1. The masses of water made their way from Leopoldau through Breitenlee, Markgrafneusiedl, Großhofen, Glinzendorf, Rutzendorf, Kimmerleinsdorf, Breitstetten, Haringsee, Straudorf, and Wagram an der Donau across the Marchfeld and flowed back into the Danube's riverbed near Stopfenreuth. A total of 74 people lost their lives due to the flood wave. Kimmerleinsdorf was almost completely destroyed. The streams of the Vienna Woods and the Wien River could no longer drain and also overflowed their banks. As a result, large parts of the city area were under water for days. However, the city was hit much harder by the subsequent cholera epidemic, which was triggered by the flooded cesspools and the contaminated groundwater. By December 1831, around 2,000 people had died from cholera."

In Skopje, four people drowned, as reported by 6 PM. The most affected areas in Skopje were the municipality of Idadija, near the City Park, the surroundings of Ilindenska Street, around the main post office, and the city square. Houses along Cvetan Dimov Street were endangered due to the overflow of the Serava River. Around 4:00 PM, all schools were dismissed. Students who lived nearby were met by their parents at the school gates, but there were children who lived far away and could not return home due to the water. At the new concrete bridge, work was halted due to the heavy rains. However, the workers did not leave their posts and, together with experts, began removing large logs carried by the dangerous currents of the Vardar River with long iron rods from as early as 3:00 AM. This bridge was supposed to be opened for use on November 29, 1962. At this bridge, the hydrometeorological service installed a water gauge. At 2:30 PM, the water level here was recorded to be eight centimeters higher compared to November 5, 1937, when the water level was 260 cm above normal, or 330 cm. Pedestrian wooden bridges, particularly those near the National Theater and the bridge located between the new concrete bridge and the railway bridge, were especially endangered. Due to their instability under the pressure of the rising waters, pedestrian traffic on them was prohibited on the morning of November 16. The railway bridge near the Military Hospital was closed to all trains, while movement on the railway bridge near Gjorce Petrov was allowed at a speed of five kilometers per hour. Only one bridge over the Vardar was safe — the Stone Bridge. The district headquarters for natural disasters immediately took measures to accommodate endangered families from the areas of Idadija and Kisela Voda in the \"Kocho Racin\" elementary school, while families from the municipalities of Kale and Saat Kula were accommodated in the Health Center of these municipalities. All lost children were also housed in these two points in the city. The Vardar River overflowed onto Ilindenska Street, Marshal Tito Square, the City Park, near the stadium, and everywhere the protective embankments were the lowest. Many basements were filled with water, and parts of the city were occasionally left without electricity. The water flooded the narrow and deep spaces of the \"St. Andrew\" Monastery, and everything in the restaurant by the Matka Lake was underwater. Villages in the vicinity of Gjorce Petrov were also affected. The dam of the new reservoir near the village of Bojane was breached. Due to the high water level of the Treska River, the lake near the Matka Hydroelectric Power Plant was overfilled, and as a result, water was gradually released to prevent danger to the dam of the lake itself. In Saraj, the camping grounds were flooded."

In Ohrid, several thousand citizens were evacuated, and over 500 houses were flooded. All villages in Resen were underwater. Parts of Titov Veles and Kičevo were seriously endangered. Bogomila was cut off from other towns. The situation was similar in Debar. Tetovo was left without postal and telecommunications connections. Kruševo was completely isolated from the world. For two days and nights, the people of Struga fought against the massive water surge from the lake. Around Ohrid Lake: scattered boats filled with mud and various household items. In Struga, the lake overflowed and flooded the entire tourist settlement. The Sateska River flooded a large part of the Struga Field. The Jablanica River overflowed, flooding and destroying roads in several places. Due to prolonged torrential rains, the Vidobishka and Koselska Rivers overflowed, spreading 3 and 2 kilometers wide, respectively, along their entire course. These two rivers also flooded parts of Ohrid. In addition to these two rivers, the Daljan River also overflowed, spreading about 2 kilometers wide. In Ohrid, due to the rising waters, about ten houses collapsed. Since the water level rose more than a meter, the flooded houses could only be accessed by boats. Around 350 families were evacuated and accommodated in the \"Bratstvo – Edinstvo\" primary school, the Jugohrom hotel, and the PTT hotel. The water surge caused the collapse of several houses in Resen, Carev Dvor, Drmeni, Gorna and Dolna Bela Crkva, and other areas. All citizens aged 15 to 55 were mobilized. The village of Ezerani, south of Resen, was cut off from other settlements. Bitola and Pelagonia were underwater. After heavy rains, the Crna River rose, followed by the Šemnica, Dragor in Bitola, and Kurderes, as well as all their tributaries and village streams. In the morning, the Dragor overflowed near the slaughterhouse, and at the same time, so did the Kurderes, combining their waters and flooding a vast area near Bitola, before the railway line. Near the village of Novaci, the Crna River flooded 3,000 hectares of arable land. The waters of the Crna River also destroyed two large bridges near the village of Brod. The Vukri fish farm was damaged. Near Titov Veles, the Vardar and Topolka Rivers rose 4.5 meters above normal. The entire \"Vasil Levski\" street, on the left side of the Vardar, was flooded. The buildings of the \"Trajko Andreev\" and \"Blagoj Kirkov\" schools were underwater up to the first floor. At the city market, the water reached a height of one meter. Five families were evacuated on the first day after the flood. Two bridges on the Topolka were swept away. 6,000 chickens and chicks from the \"Stochar\" enterprise were destroyed. The Babuna River overflowed its banks. Bogomila was completely isolated from the railway station because the bridge over the Babuna could not be crossed. The water surge uprooted trees along the riverbank and flooded the football field. In Bogomila and Tetovo, several houses were flooded, and according to initial estimates, about 70 hectares of sown land were affected. Tetovo region: road and postal communications were disrupted. The rising Pena River, whose level increased by more than a meter, destroyed riverbank walls in several places and flooded the streets: \"Leninova,\" \"Mirče Acev,\" and \"Jeni Malo.\" The basements of some institutions, including the Veterinary Station, were flooded. In Prilep: the Oreovečka River rose and swept away two wooden bridges in the Tabana area. In this area, one private house was endangered due to a landslide on the left riverbank. The river carried away trees and several livestock. Large areas of the Prilep Field were underwater."

The water surge destroyed three bridges in Skopje and three in Gjorce Petrov. In Ohrid, 36 houses were destroyed by the flood, 57 were damaged, and 56 houses were inaccessible because they were filled with mud and water two days after the flood. In many cities, there was a general mobilization of the population, members of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), and the People's Militia, and all possible means of transportation were engaged. The department store \"Skopje\" reported the first material damage of 300 million dinars. It was estimated that the total damage from the flood exceeded 10 billion dinars. The sewage and water supply networks were severely damaged, and the pumping stations at Rasce and Kozle were destroyed. Saraj was completely destroyed and inaccessible. Underground waters emerged in distant areas from the Vardar River, such as near the railway station.\n\nThe building of the National Theater in Skopje was damaged, especially the electrical installations, the stage rotation mechanism, and the scenery. On the first day after the flood, teams of soldiers and firefighters were sent from Nis, Leskovac, Surdulica, Urosevac, Kosovska Mitrovica, Belgrade, Prizren, and other places. From Negotino to Demir Kapija, the Vardar River was on average 400 meters wide. Near Gevgelija, there was a lake 8 kilometers wide. In the Gevgelija area, five bridges were destroyed. Two kilometers from Gevgelija, trains \"floated\" 200 meters through water.\n\nIn the Tetovo area, 3,000 hectares were flooded, and eight bridges were swept away. The archival material of the film production company \"Vardar – Film\" was completely destroyed. The negatives of all feature and documentary films shot from 1945 until the day of the flood were completely destroyed. In the Skopje Zoo, only about 20% of the animals perished, while the rest were saved, including lions, monkeys, the elephant, the hippopotamus, the tiger, and the reticulated python. Alongside the efforts of the Yugoslav People's Army, the entire population and the People's Militia, young people joined in, significantly contributing to helping those affected by the natural disasters across all regions of Macedonia. Youth work brigades and groups were made available to the disaster response headquarters. Youth and student work groups participated in clearing damaged houses and rescuing endangered families. They began organized efforts to protect and clean schools, dormitories, and other facilities. On November 19, 1962, 3,830 young people worked to clear the streets of Skopje, while on November 20, 1962, around 5,000 young people were involved in the affected areas of Skopje and its surroundings. On the initiative of the Main and District Committee of the Red Cross and the Disaster Response Headquarters of the Idadija Municipality, a group of youth leaders and activists organized the transfer and care of children from the most affected families in the Idadija Municipality area to the Red Cross center on Vodno. In this reception center, 72 children aged 7 to 14 were transferred. Such youth engagement was also noted in other parts of Macedonia: Bitola, Titov Veles, Ohrid, Gevgelija, and other affected areas. Youth organizations also assisted in the actions of health authorities to vaccinate the population to prevent the potential spread of infectious diseases."

The rain began in the afternoon and completely flooded the partially narrow stream valleys with flood waves up to three meters high downstream.[1][2][4] Severe storms occurred in the areas of Kupprichhausen (⊙49.5269059.62103), Lengenrieden (⊙49.5279999.64004), Oberlauda (⊙49.56669.6787), Heckfeld (⊙49.551299.63651), Dittwar (⊙49.5902789.636111), Brehmen (⊙49.5694139.554947), Gissigheim (⊙49.5942789.58725), Königheim (⊙49.6177789.595556), and Tauberbischofsheim (⊙49.62259.662778). The center of the heavy rain was in the area of Hof Esselbrunn (⊙49.5730479.590232) and Reisberg (⊙49.5759.6045). The water masses flowed through the Eisgrundgraben (⊙49.5647749.61033, ⊙49.5907679.631603) and Ölbach towards Dittwar (13.5 cubic meters/second) and via the Adelsgraben above Gissigheim as well as the Brehmbach towards Königheim (10 to 19 cubic meters/second) and streamed towards the villages and towns below.[2][3] Around the same time, a two-meter-high flood wave rushed through the Schüpfbach valley towards Kupprichhausen and Lengenrieden on a width of about 100 meters.[2] The flood reached its peak around 5 p.m. with a flow rate of about 100 to 120 m³/s. Subsequently, at 5:18 p.m., District Administrator Georg Denzer declared a disaster alarm for the Main-Tauber district.[1][2] Following this, police teams and a SAR helicopter of the German Air Force were dispatched to the disaster area. Additionally, forces from the DLRG, fire departments, and the Technical Relief Organization were mobilized to the affected area.[3] Shortly thereafter, and only about half an hour after the rain stopped, the situation worsened again: The dam of the Gissigheim retention basin (⊙49.5788069.567639) broke around 5:20 p.m. after being overtopped with extremely high outflows.[3][6] Previously, the bottom outlet had been clogged, and the flood relief system could no longer handle the water masses after debris at the grid cover of the relief system significantly reduced its capacity. As a result, the dam was overtopped by up to 65 cm before breaking, with an estimated maximum outflow of 54 m³/s.[6] The second flood wave triggered by the dam break damaged a large part of the houses in Königheim up to the second floor.[1][3] The dam, like most dams of that time, was not designed to withstand overtopping and was therefore not erosion-resistant on its downstream side. However, the actual cause of the dam break was not the regressive erosion but the integration of the relief system into the dam body, where the interlocking of the overflow structure was missing, and cavities were present due to the recessed components.[6] The maximum water level in the reservoir was 10.7 m, and the storage volume was 0.144 million m³.[7] At the start of the dam break, 0.165 million m³ were stored.[6] Due to the retention effect (storage effect) of the widening Brehmbach valley, the second flood wave in Königheim could no longer be recognized as a single wave in the general flood.[6] The water peak level in Königheim lasted until about 6 p.m. due to the retention effect.[3] Despite the dam break, the retention basin prevented even greater damage in Königheim, as it delayed the flood wave of the Brehmbach, allowing the flood waves from the catchment areas below the basin to flow ahead and preventing the waves from overlapping.[6] The flood in Königheim had largely subsided by around 7 p.m.[3] The railway embankment (⊙49.603579.6438) of the then Tauberbischofsheim–Königheim railway line, lying across the flow direction of the Muckbach from Dittwar near the Dittwar station, prevented even greater disaster for Tauberbischofsheim. The Umpfertal, Königshofen, Sachsenflur, Schweigern, and Boxberg also fared relatively well due to high railway embankments. These caused a backwater, which, however, became a disaster for some other communities.[4] Police, fire departments, the military, the Technical Relief Organization, DLRG, and the Red Cross were continuously deployed.[1][3] Several missing person reports were not confirmed, and there were no fatalities,[8] but nine people were injured. However, over 1,200 animals died, half of them large livestock. 24 buildings were completely destroyed, and 184 were severely damaged.[2] Large parts of the stream and river meadows were underwater, and numerous buildings were at risk of collapse. Electricity and telecommunications networks, as well as water supplies, failed in large parts of the disaster area. In addition to Federal Highway 27, several state and district roads were no longer passable.[8] Over 100 vehicles were swept away by the water masses, completely demolished, or piled on top of each other.[9] On the evening of the disaster, the disaster management team called for boiling drinking water throughout the disaster area.[8] In an initial estimate, the district office's disaster management team assumed about 7,000 people were directly affected by the flood disaster, suffering significant damage to their property.[9]"

By the morning, a large part of the water had already receded, and the water levels of the Tauber River began to drop again. At 6:45 a.m., technical emergency management teams were established in the four most affected municipalities (Königheim, Tauberbischofsheim, Boxberg, and Lauda-Königshofen). Around 1,000 emergency personnel began the initial cleanup efforts. District Administrator Georg Denzer stated in a press conference in the afternoon: \"At the moment, it is not my task to estimate the damage caused. The priority was and still is to contain the disaster and to avert danger to people and animals. Now it's time to clean up and rebuild. And for that, we need help.\" The initial priority was the evacuation of people from houses at risk of collapse. Additionally, efforts were made to restore power supply, telecommunications networks, and road connections. In areas with destroyed water supplies, the population was provided with water via tank trucks. Since the suction baskets of the fire department pumps were repeatedly clogged, divers had to be deployed in Tauberbischofsheim in some cases. On June 22, Baden-Württemberg's Interior Minister Dietmar Schlee visited the site to gain a personal impression of the emergency situation and promised swift assistance from the state."

Power and drinking water supplies were now ensured through emergency generators (including those from Badenwerk) and water treatment facilities. The structural securing of buildings and bridges, as well as the removal of approximately 1,200 animal carcasses, were the most urgent tasks. The floods had scattered the animal carcasses across the entire, partially still flooded, disaster area or buried them under debris, making cleanup efforts challenging. Additionally, basements were cleared of mud, wood was removed, and homes were cleaned. Another focus was on removing oil slicks after some oil tanks in flooded basements had overturned and leaked. Disaster tourism, which began on this Saturday, proved extremely disruptive for everyone involved. According to emergency personnel, onlookers showed no consideration for the people affected by the disaster and increasingly hindered rescue efforts, necessitating barriers over an ever-wider area."

Previously completed operational areas became relevant again after numerous already drained basements were reflooded by infiltrating pressure water. In the meantime, the farmers' association ensured the supply of agricultural businesses with feed and other necessary goods. Water tests conducted by the State Chemical Investigation Office revealed that all water sources in the affected area were contaminated with coliform bacteria. The boiling requirement for drinking water thus remained in place until daily samples could rule out any danger to the population. Heavy clearing equipment was only needed to a limited extent, and the deployed military units could be withdrawn from the disaster operation. Although the operation was not yet completed on June 27, the number of aid workers could be gradually reduced one week after the flood.

                "content": "The Goglio is a mountain stream that originates from the lakes of the Orobie Alps above Lake Aviasco, flowing into the Serio in the valley floor at Pranzera di Gromo after a 5 km course, overcoming a height difference of about 1550 m. Since the 13th century, on the right side of the stream, from the Colarete hamlet to the Pranzera locality, its waters were used through sluices, serving workshops that forged bladed weapons; this area was called the Goglio district. The extraction of iron and other minerals is documented as early as Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD), who referred to Christians condemned by the Romans to extract metals in the mines of the upper Val Seriana as Damnatio ad metalla in his Naturalis Historia. The upper valley, along with neighboring areas, was donated by Charlemagne in 774 to the monasteries of Saint Martin of Tours and Saint-Denis. Reclaimed by the Church of Bergamo in 1026, it became the subject of disputes and clashes centered on mining rights between the bishopric and local noble families who owned the lands with iron and silver mines, including the Colleoni and Rivola families. In 1267, the village obtained the privilege of being called a borough, with the right to work the minerals and enjoy the income derived from extraction and processing. Ironworking in the upper valley became very important and more productive under Venetian rule in 1427; it included not only the territory of Gromo, which was considered the \"little Toledo,\" but also the surrounding areas. The altarpiece of the Church of San Gregorio, titled Madonna with Child between Saints Gregory the Great and Charles Borromeo, painted in 1624 by Enea Salmeggia, and the private property map drawn by notary Bartolomeo Scacchi illustrate how the village appeared at the time and where the forges, residences, and other activities were located."

Several concurrent events took place which, despite having different causes, developed in a chain reaction. Written accounts tell of continuous days of heavy rain that had swollen the stream, a phenomenon certainly not uncommon, as its waters were not regulated by dams or artificial reservoirs. Testimonies collected from shepherds who were staying in the area on the opposite side of the valley and witnessed the event describe a strong wind that carried away people and rocks; subsequently, a loud roar was heard, caused by the collapse of a part of the mountain called Cima Bani, likely triggered by the rains and the severe deforestation that had occurred over the centuries to meet the great demand for charcoal furnaces, which had made the terrain unstable. As it descended into the valley, the landslide dragged trees and rocks with it, skirting the Novazza hamlet of Valgoglio, until it reached the Colarete hamlet, where it settled above the Goglio stream, blocking it and forming a lake, which, swollen with water, soil, and debris, overflowed, carrying with it the material and everything in its path, including the forges, with their furnaces, hammers, warehouses, houses, and even two small churches. Gabriele Medolago's book cites on page 26: the church was entirely destroyed... along with some properties located in the same district, and there was no hope of rebuilding churches or anything else due to the instability of the river. Upon reaching the valley floor, this landslide blocked the Serio River, which, swollen with debris and incessant rains, overflowed, carrying away men and houses beyond the town's borders.  \nAll of this happened in the time of a Pater Noster."

The geography of the village, divided into three distinct nuclei, located on the west side of the Serio river, and the event occurring on a holiday, saved a good part of the villagers: in fact, the documented victims number between 63 and 67. The district of Goglio was located in the southernmost part of the village; here were 27 forges; the workers' houses; two small churches, that of San Rocco, the small oratory called Santa Croce[10], and two bridges that allowed access to the northern area of the valley. In the upper part was the village, situated on a hill, with the castle and the palace inhabited by noble families, and further north in the valley, the parish church, which, given the midday hour, fortunately hosted the faithful for the All Saints' Day services. Testimonies of the event have been documented since the first days. On November 3, a dispatch was sent to Venice by Captain Francesco Dandolo and Podestà Gerolamo Giustiniano, with a detailed account of the events, damages, and victims; this document is preserved in the State Archives of Venice. On November 6, the archpriest of Clusone, Alessandro Ghirardelli, came for an inspection and, although he left a somewhat exaggerated testimony, he describes not only the material damages but also the emotional state of the villagers; as does the document of notary Gregorio Scacchi, now preserved in the archives of the parish of Gromo. The flooding of the Serio carried downstream not only debris but also the bodies of the victims, which are documented in the parish registers. The remains of the dead extracted from the river's waters are documented in the archives of Parre, Alzano Lombardo, and as far as Seriate. The event was also reported by the historian Giovanni Maironi da Ponte[11].\""

The population decline within the first month was 30%; the flood had forced the workforce to migrate to other locations, suddenly finding themselves without work and unable to wait for the reconstruction, which could not be immediate. Even the dead were not immediately extracted from the rubble but are documented in church records from December 1666 through all of 1667. In Venice, measures were initiated for tax relief, which were initially granted for five years and then renewed from time to time. The damages were estimated at 60,000 scudi, justifying the exemptions from the payment of taxes and rents, which were applied from 1666 until the mid-18th century. In 1733, a list was drawn up of families entitled to compensation from the Venetian Republic. Recovery and reconstruction were very slow; it took fifty years before the destroyed part of the settlement was reused. Other forges were built, but the activity that had made the town of Gromo famous no longer yielded the same profits: times had changed, and demands were different. However, subsequent production is documented, not only of bladed weapons but also of arquebuses."

In Berguedà, it had severe consequences for the economy, as in addition to destroying communication infrastructures and private properties, it severely impacted the textile industry and mining, the two economic pillars of the region at that time. The existence of the Baells dam prevented the damages from being even more severe in the Llobregat valley.

The town councils were not notified, as it was considered that at that time no one would be there. \n\nIn the towns of lower Berguedà located along the Llobregat River, such as Gironella, concern began to grow over the river's rise. Although it had rained in the lower part of the region, such a significant increase in flow was not explained, as the magnitude of the rainfall in upper Berguedà was unknown. The intensity of the rain increased the higher up one went.\n\nBy 8 p.m., the water had already reached the level of the river street in Gironella, and the local Red Cross and volunteer firefighters began working, monitoring the river's course. At 10:30 p.m., the peak time for water inflow into the La Baells reservoir at 1,200 m³/s, a call was made from the reservoir to the Gironella Nursing Home, informing them that they had begun evacuating the residents. Considering the time it would take for the water to arrive, the gates were opened. 800 m³/s were released, while the usual flow is 7 m³/s. The reservoir level reached 631.48, one and a half meters above the maximum capacity (630). It was a delicate moment, as it was the first time the reservoir had reached this point, and it was unknown how the dam would respond."

Regarding municipalities, those with the highest losses are, in order: Cercs (1,500 million pts.), Puig-reig (737), Gironella (180), Casserres (144), Guardiola (77), Berga (76), Fígols (62), La Pobla (52). On the other hand, concerning private properties, the most affected were the towns with buildings along the river. The force of the water, when the water level reached the height of the buildings, demolished several homes, some completely and others partially. The affected municipalities were: Guardiola, Gironella, and La Pobla de Lillet. Additionally, these same towns, along with the towns of Puig-reig, Cercs, and Bagà, suffered damages to municipal facilities, communications, and public works such as bridges, paths, roads, retaining walls, etc. Overall, damages to roads, bridges, and local and regional road communications exceeded 100 million pesetas."

The rise in the river level covered all the machinery and installations, which meant that, in addition to repairing or replacing them, they were left without energy production. The companies affected in the turbines in Berguedà were: Filatura Berguedana (La Pobla de Lillet), Colònia Rosal, Cal Metre (Gironella), Filats i Teixits Fusté (Cal Bassacs), Viladomiu Nou, Viladomiu Vell, Ferrer (Vilada), Colònia Guixaró (Casserres), Colònia Prat (Puig-reig), Colònia Pons (Puig-reig), Colònia Marçal (Puig-reig), Colònia Manent (Puig-reig), and l'Ametlla de Merola.

Between nine and half-past nine, a crowd of people had already gathered near the Eres Bridge and the Old Bridge, where it was expected that the flood would have repercussions. At the same time, a house on Riu Street, the Ferrer family (known as Maruja's house), had already been evacuated as the water was rising above the door. Simultaneously, water began to enter the lower levels of the Sant Roc Hospital-Residence; however, the lack of communication about what was happening upstream and the lack of foresight meant that the evacuation of the elderly did not begin until much later. Access to the Old Bridge and the Eres Bridge was cut off due to the risk of collapse, which eventually happened, isolating the Cal Ramons neighborhood and the Eres neighborhood from the urban center. The old town could only be accessed via the wall. Evacuations began for houses on the left side of Avinguda Catalunya, from the Eres Bridge to the Slaughterhouse. Riu Street was also evacuated, where it was no longer passable, and water was already entering the lower levels and ground-floor apartments. On this street, water entered all the lower levels, and several homes were completely destroyed. Regarding the Sant Roc Residence, as water reached the main door, all elderly residents were evacuated through the ambulance garage and the passage leading to Avinguda Catalunya, and they were initially relocated to the Pearl Pub, the Victoria Cinema, and the lower levels of the Parish Hall. The operation lasted until 3 a.m. The Apolo building on Avinguda Catalunya was also evacuated as water was undermining its foundations. Power, drinking water, and telephone supply cuts persisted for much of the following day, Monday. The City Council offered housing and financial aid to families who had lost their homes."

When the water level receded, the first people who entered the building found that the machinery was rendered unusable—some machines in an irreparable state—walls had collapsed, everything was covered in mud, and the thread had been scattered. The Bonser warehouse, which was full of manufactured goods, was left empty. The initiative to try to resume activity began immediately. The company applied for unemployment benefits for the workers. At the same time, the population, which largely depended on work at the factory, collaborated in the recovery efforts. The predominant sentiment was to act immediately to return to normality. The first task that kept most of the population busy was removing mud, using rakes and dumpers. Meanwhile, women and retirees also contributed by cleaning small parts. Efforts were made to save the electrical components of the looms, and mud was removed from the looms using the motor pump lent by farmers from the municipality of Sagàs, which were later cleaned with petroleum and sprayed with anti-corrosive agents. The Vocational Training School of Navàs also provided personnel and tools to assist in the recovery efforts. In short, it was a model of cooperation to save not only a company, on which jobs depended, but also to restore normality to a population, with the associated social and cultural aspects."

This meteorological configuration was characterized by persistent and abundant rainfall, especially near the western and northern Alpine reliefs and the areas bordering Liguria. The dynamics and meteorological configuration were similar to the flood that affected Piedmont in 2000. The November 2016 flood caused significant damage across much of the regional territory, due to numerous landslides, mudslides, and flooding with frequent overflow of streams.

At the time of the flooding, which occurred in the early hours, miners Jorge Sánchez Martínez and Enrique Ojeda González were working on level 55. On the surface, outside the mine, it was noticed that the fans responsible for injecting fresh air into the shaft had stopped working, and an alarm sounded for only 10 seconds. At five in the morning, a supervisor entered the mine and discovered the tragedy: the mine had been flooded. The location of the workers at the time of the accident is unknown, but it is presumed they headed to a shelter on level 203, which was attempted to be reached in a second drilling attempt after the first one failed. Simultaneously, rescue teams tried to contain the flooding using dikes. The miners' unions proposed bringing in robots and divers to cross the flooded areas and search for the miners in the galleries.

This one-hour rainfall approached the Japanese record of 187 mm (Nagasaki Prefecture's Nagayo Town during the 1982 Nagasaki Flood), and the nine-hour rainfall significantly exceeded the Japan Meteorological Agency's 12-hour rainfall record of 695.0 mm (recorded at Kochi Local Meteorological Observatory during the 1998 Kochi Heavy Rain). Within the nine-hour timeframe, the rainfall intensity in the mountainous areas of Asakura City was among the highest in Japan's meteorological observation history.\n\nAt 5:51 p.m. on July 5, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rain warning for regions centered on the Chikugo and Chikuho areas of Fukuoka Prefecture, stating that \"the risk of severe damage is imminent.\" Furthermore, at 7:55 p.m., a special heavy rain warning was issued for almost the entire Oita Prefecture. At 3:10 a.m. on July 6, the Japan Meteorological Agency expanded the special heavy rain warning to include five cities and two towns in Fukuoka Prefecture, covering most of Fukuoka Prefecture and nearly all of Oita Prefecture.\n\nAt the time of the heavy rain, warm and moist air from a tropical depression south of the region was flowing into the rainy season front near the Tsushima Strait in northern Kyushu, while cold air was present in the upper atmosphere, creating highly unstable atmospheric conditions. Under these circumstances, cumulonimbus clouds repeatedly formed near the boundary between warm air near the surface and cold air. The cooled air from the preceding rainfall in the Chugoku and Shikoku regions flowed in, intensifying the situation. Additionally, moist air flowed in from two directions, converging east of the Sefuri Mountain Range on the Fukuoka-Saga Prefecture border, which is believed to have intensified the rainfall. The linear rainband was maintained through a process called back-building formation, where cumulonimbus clouds repeatedly formed and developed while moving eastward.\n\nThe weather forecast on the morning of the heavy rain predicted cloudy skies with occasional severe thunderstorms in the Chikugo region in the afternoon, and sunny to cloudy skies with possible thunderstorms from the morning in western Oita Prefecture."

Additionally, 2 people are missing in Asakura City, Fukuoka Prefecture. Housing damage totals in Fukuoka and Oita Prefectures include 336 completely destroyed houses, 1,096 partially destroyed houses, 44 partially damaged houses, 180 houses flooded above floor level, and 1,481 houses flooded below floor level (including damage caused by Typhoon No. 3). According to a survey by Professor Motoyuki Ushiyama of the Shizuoka University Disaster Prevention Research Center, the causes of death and missing persons were 23 due to landslides and 18 due to flooding. Despite many houses being washed away by the floods and a high number of flood victims, a significant number (30 people) were affected indoors, which is a characteristic of this heavy rain disaster."

In Hita City, Oita Prefecture, part of the Oihigawa River overflowed, causing some areas to become isolated. The Kagetsugawa River also overflowed in Hita City. A large amount of driftwood was observed in the disaster-affected areas, and the total amount that flowed into the rivers is estimated to be approximately 200,000 tons, or 360,000 cubic meters. Cedar trees and other wood knocked down by landslides flowed down the rivers, blocking the flow and causing flooding. The driftwood that surged into residential areas increased the destructive power compared to just water flow, causing significant damage to houses. In addition to direct destruction, the driftwood also caused damage indirectly by increasing the pressure of the water flow. In Hita City, a bridge on the JR Kyudai Line crossing the Kagetsugawa River was washed away, and it is believed that driftwood caught on the bridge, blocking the water and increasing the water volume, which exerted greater force on the bridge."

This landslide caused a river to be dammed, creating an earth and sand dam. The mountainous area, composed of a geological formation called \"masado,\" could not withstand the sudden heavy rain, leading to surface collapses in various locations. Due to the surface collapses, cedar driftwood flowed into the river, causing reservoirs to breach. It has also been pointed out that artificial forests, such as those densely planted with cedar trees, may not have been adequately managed, as insufficient thinning and lack of sunlight hinder tree growth and prevent the development of deep roots."

In Lower Silesia, the waters of the Oder River and its tributaries, including the Bóbr, Bystrzyca, Kaczawa, Kwisa, Mała Panew, Nysa Kłodzka, Nysa Łużycka, Olza, Oława, Ślęza, and Widawa, overflowed. The floodwaters of the Oder entered the city on July 12, 1997, and finally receded on August 6. In Wrocław, the Millennium Flood was particularly severe because two flood waves coincided: one from the Oder and one from the Widawa. Additionally, a few days before the peak, residents of the village of Łany near Wrocław did not allow it to be flooded, which would have significantly reduced the damage. Due to the specific course of the river through the city, flooding occurred independently both in the city center and in the northern part of Wrocław. Forty percent of the city's area was submerged."

This system proved effective during the floods of 1975 and 1985, but it did not account for the accumulation of waves from more than one river, i.e., water flow of around 3600 m³/s[4]."

The greatest losses in the upper Oder basin were recorded in the Wodzisław, Racibórz, and Opole districts. Just two days before the flood, the local edition of Gazeta Wyborcza reported: \"In Wrocław, we are not threatened by a flood, but (...) individual basements may be flooded\"[6]. The highest flood wave began reaching Wrocław on July 12, Saturday, in the afternoon hours[4]. The fact that the city's residents already knew from the press, radio, and television about the damage caused by the Oder in Racibórz and Opole, and that for most of them it was a day off work, significantly influenced their mobilization and ability to self-organize in response to the approaching threat. Already on the preceding Thursday (July 10), the city's mayor, Bogdan Zdrojewski, alarmed by the situation in Opole, appealed to Wrocław residents to start stockpiling drinking water and to the directors of the city's largest institutions to take appropriate preparatory actions in case of a flood[4]. Additionally, just before Wrocław, two peak water levels merged: from the Nysa Kłodzka and the Oder[7]."

However, opposition from a large group of residents of these villages, as well as Kamieniec Wrocławski, particularly in Łany, prevented the water from being released onto the local fields and residential buildings. Although preparatory work and the gathering of explosives by sappers were already underway, and the embankments were secured by a police cordon, people, alarmed by one of the residents, came out on the night of July 11 to defend the villages from flooding. During the placement of explosives, clashes occurred between the sappers and the residents of Łany. By morning, the deputy voivode canceled the sappers' operation, and the residents were informed that \"a mistake had been made.\" Another attempt was made by the voivode, who arrived in the village around 6:00 PM, but he also failed to convince the residents. The deputy commander of the Wrocław police, Jan Albrechciński, refused to use force. The Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration, Leszek Miller, who was in Wrocław that day, demanded the dismissal of the deputy commander. Another decision was made at four in the morning. The operation was carried out using helicopters, but the explosives turned out to be too small to breach the embankments. The next day, Prime Minister Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz, who was in Wrocław, signed blank promissory notes to compensate for the losses caused by the destruction of the village. The voivode and the marshal of the regional council, Leon Kieres, went to Łany with the promissory notes. They also failed to convince the residents. The situation in Łany became a topic of discussion among politicians, ethicists, hydrologists, and even the Supreme Audit Office. A journalist from Gazeta Wyborcza commented on the stance of the residents of Łany as follows: Łany became a symbol. For some, it represented the lesser evil, an attempt to save a large city at the cost of flooding several hundred farms and homes in fifteen villages; for others, it symbolized the determination of ordinary people against a heartless, arrogant government ready to use the police and military to destroy their life's possessions in the name of saving Wrocław's monuments. On the same day, President Zdrojewski issued an order to evacuate residents of neighborhoods bordering Wrocław to the north and east. However, most residents refused and stayed in their homes."

Panic spread in the city, and some residents accused the president of collusion with mineral water bottling companies. On July 11, the construction of formwork began in the city. The action was coordinated by the flood prevention committee, and work was carried out in shifts. According to estimates by the City Office, between 300,000 and 480,000 sandbags were laid in Wrocław. Some of the bags were even transported by air, including from as far as Gdańsk. They were filled not only with sand brought in for this purpose from sandpits, but there was widespread approval for using sand stockpiled for street repairs in various parts of the city (e.g., a significant section of prepared underlay on General Józef Haller Street was dug up for this purpose); most children's sandboxes in Wrocław were also emptied in the process. Soil was also taken from lawns. In the most flood-prone areas of the city, the sandbags were initially laid mainly by spontaneously gathered volunteers, who generally relied on their own knowledge of the local topography, often responding to announcements broadcast on radio and television. Later, organized groups of soldiers and firefighters from across the country also arrived at these locations. On Friday, July 11, the flood embankment in Siechnice was breached, ultimately ensuring that the flood wave would reach Wrocław. On July 12, around 6:00 AM, residents of the Księże Małe neighborhood were alerted by police officers announcing via megaphones the need for immediate evacuation in the face of the approaching flood wave from the northeast (the Oława River basin). However, the vast majority of residents stayed in their homes and began preparations to fend off the flood wave. For this purpose, every available source of sand was used, for example, all nearby sandboxes were completely emptied. Car owners tried from early morning to move their vehicles and park them in other parts of the city, with some desperately searching for any nearby elevations to protect their vehicles from destruction. Around 1:00 PM, water overflowed Opolska Street and entered the neighborhood, reaching a height of 180 cm within an hour. Streets such as Katowicka, Chorzowska, Bytomska, Tarnogórska, and Głubczycka were flooded. Over the next few days, food and water were delivered by military Mi-17 helicopters, whose crews dropped supplies onto rooftops or lowered them on ropes."

In this way, the northern part of the city was completely cut off from the southern part. It was only on Monday, July 14, in the afternoon, that residents managed to block the water at Żabia Grobla. The neighborhoods of Zalesie and Zacisze, located between the flood channel and the old Odra riverbed, were also affected, while Sępolno and Biskupin were protected from flooding. The Wrocław Zoo was also saved (only one zebra died, frightened by the noise of helicopters), but the flood affected the Japanese Garden, which had just been renovated for the Eucharistic Congress. Water entered neighborhoods built on floodplains: Kowale, Maślice, Księże Małe, Księże Wielkie, Rakowiec, Widawa, and Pracze Odrzańskie. The Kozanów neighborhood was particularly damaged, where the waves of the Odra and Ślęza rivers overlapped. In this area, the water reached as high as the first floor. This neighborhood was built on floodplain polders, and due to delays in the decision to breach the flood embankments and flood recreational plots, the situation there became critical at one point. Similarly, the water reached the first floor in Rakowiec (the so-called Bermuda Triangle), and the pre-World War II tenement houses there, often with wooden ceilings, were so severely damaged that many had to be demolished (a few collapsed on their own; no one was injured). In Szczepin, the water remained exceptionally long due to the terrain's shape. The flood lasted the longest in Kozanów and Księże Małe, where even several days after the wave passed, access to buildings was only possible by pontoon or kayak. On July 16, the water began to recede from the city center. On that day, bus transportation resumed. On Friday, July 18, the water level at the measurement point in Trestno dropped by over 1.5 meters; water began to drain from Popowice. On the same day, a second flood wave was expected; the mayor ordered the immediate evacuation of residents from the city's northwestern districts, including Leśnica and Pracze Odrzańskie. The situation was worsened by heavy rain during those days. It was only around July 22 that areas near Siechnice began to dry out. Desperate residents of this town blocked the road to Wrocław. On July 23, the Ślęza River overflowed its banks (due to backflow) and flooded Kozanów and Muchobór again. The second flood wave reached Wrocław on July 25 around 6:30 PM, once again flooding Siechnice."

                "content": "The flood relief operation was conducted by the then-existing Provincial Flood Committee, the Regional Flood Committee, and the City Flood Committee, established by a special decree of the president. A major operation was carried out on the night of July 12-13 on Ostrów Tumski, aiming to save the most valuable monuments. In addition to volunteers, the fire brigade worked to control the flow of large objects such as trees, containers, and even a kiosk, which at any moment could strike a critical point, such as a bridge span. Other important sites saved included the main train station, the Ossolineum library, and the collections of the National Museum. The work was carried out even at the risk of health and life. As Bogdan Zdrojewski recalls, at one point, a firefighter drove a hook too deeply into a floating tree, and in an attempt to save him, he almost made a pole vault-like jump into the water. The force of the water was simply enormous. He was barely kept on the shore. A similar situation occurred with a young man who, while defending the zoo, tried to pull some floating object out of the water. The current there was quite fast, and he likely owes his life to the quick reflexes of his colleagues. About 5,000 people participated in the rescue work, and during the entire flood period, 20,000 people helped. To prevent the southern districts of the city from flooding, it was necessary to create a barrier along the railway viaduct line running from Brochów, through the Main Station, and further towards the Fabryczna district. As a result, the water was forced to flow through a narrow strip in the city to reconnect with the original current near Kozanów. This plan succeeded, and the southern districts were ultimately not flooded. The rescue operation also faced bureaucratic obstacles. The city president sought immediate vaccination of residents against typhoid and tetanus, but permission was not granted. There was a lack of cooperation between central institutions, and problems arose regarding the division of responsibilities: state services were responsible for hydrotechnical equipment. Financial decisions were also lacking. One of the absurd accusations was the Supreme Audit Office's complaint that President Zdrojewski did not sign the attendance list during the flood. Alongside the rescue operation, humanitarian aid efforts for the residents of the flooded city were underway. Convoys with aid arrived in the city, despite the difficulty of access. The largest aid coordination center was located in the Poltegor building (which housed, among others, Lower Silesian Television). The president, police, and volunteers worked there."

                "content": "In the first days, the Oder River flooded a cemetery and a landfill, and the lack of electricity also affected critical locations, including hospitals. The stock of vaccines quickly ran out, and residents began to fear an epidemic. Water was cut off throughout the city, some neighborhoods were without electricity, and phones and much of public transportation were not functioning. Food was delivered to buildings cut off from water by thirty military Mi-17 helicopters. People used the few wells available, including one at the Powstańców Śląskich roundabout. People gathered on the roofs of flooded buildings, where social life took place, and from where they communicated with the outside world. The media, especially radio and Dolnośląska Television, provided information on how to communicate with helicopters: white indicated the need for immediate help, red for medical assistance. There were also pathological phenomena: the police detained individuals speculating on the prices of mineral water, some demanded 200 zł for a ride in a pontoon, and there were also burglaries into homes abandoned during the flood. The police arrested a man who had stockpiled blankets and camp beds in his apartment, presumably to resell them for profit. Those profiting materially from the sale of donations for flood victims were to be punished under Article 204, paragraph 2 of the Penal Code, concerning the misappropriation of entrusted property, which carried a penalty of 6 months to 5 years in prison. During the flood, the most important task was to save the city. During a mass at the church on Wittiga Street, the priest told the participants: \"We can pray later, now take shovels and rubber boots and go save the zoo.\" Grocery stores in the city center opened on Monday, July 14. Among the most sought-after items were bread, cigarettes, and batteries. Despite the difficulties, most people had no trouble obtaining supplies. The Wrocław PDT department store opened in the afternoon and sold essential items from under the raised grate of the main entrance. The police appealed to stores to start mobile sales and sell from pontoons in flooded districts whenever possible. Due to the lack of electricity, some goods, such as ice cream, were given away for free by stores. Pharmacies operated normally, and in cases of chronic illnesses, prescriptions were not required; showing the medication packaging was sufficient. There were also humorous situations, such as young men diving into a liquor store. Another situation was recalled by then-Mayor Bogdan Zdrojewski: \"I was surprised, for example, by the reaction of a very young man who stopped his kayak at the sight of a red light at one of the flooded intersections. He looked left, right, and then paddled on.\" Despite the serious atmosphere, numerous jokes circulated around the city, specifically referencing the flood, such as: \"A woman calls and says she has two dogs on chains in her yard. 'And how long are the chains?' they ask at the flood committee. 'Well, about two meters.' 'Extend the chains,' she hears in response, 'a three-meter wave is coming.'\" Residents' reactions to the flood varied depending on their age. For the young, it was an opponent to be faced, and they approached it with almost sporting enthusiasm, while the older generation saw it as a threat to their property and items of sentimental value, or even a threat to their lives. Nevertheless, there were no visible differences in their actions."

Gradually, the airtime dedicated to flood information was increased, and from July 10, current updates were also broadcast at night. From Saturday, July 12, until July 16, flood news was aired non-stop. The campaign initiated by the station was joined by President Bogdan Zdrojewski and Governor Janusz Zaleski. The television also collaborated with the editorial teams of Słowo Polskie and local radio stations. Besides providing information, the station coordinated the efforts of services and volunteers fighting the flood, and the editorial office was transformed into a crisis management center. They organized sandbags, sand, volunteers, and coordinated and distributed aid to those affected by the flood. Dozens of phone numbers, both landline and mobile, were set up to assist in locating missing persons. The television returned to its regular programming only on July 28. Another important information hub, especially for those without electricity, was Radio Wrocław. The demand for information among city residents was high, and humanitarian convoys were often met with requests for radio batteries. The flood also affected the editorial offices of Gazeta Wrocławska and the Lower Silesian edition of Gazeta Wyborcza, but both newspapers had their printing facilities outside Wrocław; Gazeta Wrocławska moved its editorial office to a printing house in Bielany."

The Philharmonic building was flooded, but the pianos were saved. The ground floor of the Academy of Music was inundated. The Polish Theatre and the regional court were also flooded. Additionally, the flood damaged three sports halls, the city port, the water treatment plant, and the recently renovated Świebodzki Station. Furthermore, 44 km of roads and 21 bridges, footbridges, and viaducts had to be rebuilt. The repairs cost the city 132 million PLN, and an additional 115 million PLN in grants was obtained: 66.2 million PLN from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 43 million PLN from the World Bank, and 5.7 million PLN from the Phare program. A decision was also made to modernize Wrocław's water system and construct the Odra-Widawa canal. By 2017, Wrocław's water system was prepared for a capacity of 3,100 m³/s, with new embankments built and old ones reinforced, and the Odra riverbeds cleared and widened. The city's sandbag supply was also improved to 300,000 bags (20,000 m³). The renovation of the Kozanowska Embankment ensured that the neighborhood is safe in the event of rising water levels."

The peak wave reached Opole on July 10, 1997. The southern districts were the first to be flooded. The flood broke the embankment near the Metalchem housing estate, resulting in the flooding of many factories located there[6]. The wave then reached the Bolko and Pasieka islands.

A relief point was organized in the city center, where people affected by the flood gathered; often their only remaining possessions were the clothes they were wearing. During the rescue operation, special attention was paid to areas near flooded cemeteries, as was the case on Wrocławska Street and in Metalchem. An initiative was also undertaken to find sponsors willing to finance summer camps for children from the flooded city. Over 1,000 applications were recorded. During the flood, there were also numerous thefts from shops, cars, and homes abandoned due to evacuation. The water in the city began to recede on Wednesday, July 16."

Despite this, the people's diet was sustained by eating waterfowl, marsh herbs, roots, insects, and fish from the same lake. The year of greatest scarcity and hunger was 1454. As a result of the famine, many inhabitants left the region, some died in the fields, and others took refuge in regions such as Totonacapan (present-day Sierra Norte de Puebla) never to return. Ixtlilxóchitl states that the desperation was so great that some sold their children to the inhabitants of Totonacapan in exchange for corn.

In total, precipitation and meltwater reached a record level not seen since measurements began in 1959. The area had already experienced a prolonged period of bad weather (in connection with the severe floods in central Europe in early June), so the waters flowed off immediately. The Gave de Pau reached record levels at several gauges. In Spain, the maximum flow rates were 10 to 20 times the normal levels (Noguera Pallaresa 160 m³/s, Noguera Ribagorçana 190 m³/s).

The rain began in the evening of the 14th and turned into a heavy downpour with thunder by the early hours of the 15th, recording over 400 millimeters of rainfall in mountainous areas. This rain triggered landslides in various locations, causing debris flows that included large amounts of driftwood. Many reservoirs, weirs, and embankments of the Kizu River tributaries collapsed. In Ide Town, debris flows were triggered by the collapse of the Taisho Pond and Ninotani Pond reservoirs upstream of the Tamagawa River, which also caused the downstream Tamagawa River to collapse. In the area corresponding to the later Yamashiro Town (now Kizugawa City), the Fudo River and Naruko River collapsed, and in Wazuka Town, the Wazuka River overflowed, causing significant damage. It is said that the term \"torrential downpour\" was first used in the headlines of newspaper reports at this time."

Around 2:30 AM, the first breach occurred at the Saita River, and flooding began in low-lying areas of Ide Town. From around 3 AM, overflow and breaches started occurring sequentially from downstream on the right bank (north side) of the Tamagawa River. Then, around 4 AM, agricultural reservoirs upstream (Taisho Pond and Ninotani Pond) breached almost simultaneously, causing a mountain torrent. This led to further breaches upstream of the Tamagawa River, resulting in severe damage to Ide Town. The Tamamizu area of Ide Town was surrounded on three sides by levees—the Kizugawa levee, the Tamagawa levee, and the Taga-Tanikawa levee—making it a typical inland water flood area. As a result, while drainage progressed quickly in other affected areas, the water level in this area did not decrease even several days after the disaster, and many of the missing persons were found to have drifted to this location."

On the 16th, relief supplies were transported by U.S. Marine Corps helicopters to areas such as Wazuka Town, Minamiyamashiro Village, and Dosenbo District, where transportation had been cut off. Records show that supplies such as salt, rice, and vegetables were provided starting on the 18th. Relief supplies were transported from the Nodono District to the severely affected Dosenbo Gyuba District. In the Nodono District, a journal documenting recovery activities from the flood was preserved, noting that district residents participated in the restoration efforts. By September, operations on the Nara Line and Kansai Main Line had resumed. At Tamamizu Station, a large rock carried down from the Tamagawa River was left as a memorial. In 1954, a memorial tower for flood victims was erected. The reconstruction of the washed-away Tamamizu Bridge was completed in November 1956. On the sites of Taisho Pond and Ninotani Pond, Taisho Pond was reconstructed under the \"Yodogawa River System Improvement Basic Plan\" and completed in 1960."

The highest rainfall peaks were recorded at Col Barant, which measured approximately 312 mm (373 mm considering all three days), and at Prali, which recorded 219 mm (276 mm considering all three days). On May 29, the Amedeo di Savoia hospital in Turin was evacuated and closed due to a possible overflow of the Dora Riparia river, while some bridges in both the city and the province were closed. At 10:25, the most tragic event of the flood occurred: a large mass of mud and debris from the Rio Cassarot basin, about 40,000 m³, descended into Val Pellice, flooding the hamlet of Garin in Villar Pellice in just a few seconds. Many homes were damaged, and 2 were completely destroyed. The flow also affected roads and fields up to the confluence of the Rio Cassarot with the Pellice. Rescue operations were immediately activated from the civil hospital in Pinerolo using helicopters, ambulances, fire trucks, and vehicles from the police and the financial guard. Their assistance was supported by bulldozers for earth removal, and the excavations lasted two days. About 300 people were evacuated as a precaution. There were also disruptions in various areas of the province of Turin, where landslides were reported in Ceresole Reale and Pont Canavese. On May 30, the events came to an end, although the morning still saw moderate rainfall, followed by the assessment of damages, which amounted to about 5 million euros promptly allocated by the region."

It was the largest flood in the history of this city, inundating three-quarters of Gdańsk's then area and lasting nearly three weeks (until April 28). Several dozen people died, and about 12,000 people lost their homes. The flood was commemorated, among other things, with plaques on the walls of the \"Panna\" granary on Ołowianka and the Stone Lock in Lower Town. To protect Gdańsk and the Vistula Delta from flooding, the Vistula Cut (7.1 km long) was built between 1891 and 1895, enabling the rapid outflow of floodwaters and ice from the Vistula River directly to the Baltic Sea."

At that time, weak tremors were observed in Laza, and cracks appeared in residential houses. On September 9, the villagers witnessed a strange natural phenomenon. Countless eagles were circling over the carcasses of sheep trapped under a suddenly collapsed rock. On the morning of September 10, the residents of Laza, awakened by a terrifying roar, witnessed mud flowing from the village waterfall. As noted by scientists, after the rains on September 9–10, a landslide-mudflow process began in the area. The process started as a landslide and partially as a collapse after the rain, and the moving mass accumulated in the tributary beds of the Laza River from its source. Moving from an altitude of 2400–2500 meters, it entered the river valley. Here, the large landslide masses turned into a stony-muddy flow containing a small amount of water. Since this flow poured down a step 80–100 meters high like a waterfall, its speed increased. It spread to the sloping plain part of the Laza River valley. This lasted for one day. The mass brought by the flow caused the relief of the area to rise by 3–6 meters. In the village, located at an altitude of 1650 meters above sea level and consisting of 19 houses, 3 houses were buried under the flow. Among the materials brought by the flow were limestone rock fragments weighing 5–6 tons, even up to 15–20 tons. Scientists say that this type of landslide-mudflow is a rare phenomenon in nature. The mud brought to Laza by the flow dried up after 3 years."

In early March, the rainfall intensified, and the alert was extended to the province of Reggio Calabria, but the situation remained mostly stationary until Saturday, March 11, when a Civil Protection statement was issued upgrading the alert to the maximum level. In the early hours of Monday, March 13, 1995, the rainfall began to increase significantly, with peaks recorded between 224.6 mm and 253.6 mm. The sewers started flooding the streets of Acireale around 7:30 AM, while Giarre was declared flooded around 9:15 AM. In Calabria, the rainfall events affected the areas of the Ionian coast and Crotone, where rainfall peaks ranged from 178 mm to 191.6 mm. Soon, storms, landslides, mudslides, and some overflowing streams emerged, disrupting communications and transportation. In Acireale, two old buildings collapsed, and some cars collided, while in Giarre, a truck overturned, crushing two parked cars. Around 11:00 AM, the municipalities affected by the flood urged citizens to stay indoors and go out as little as possible. Numerous buildings were damaged, and in the countryside, many agricultural fields were destroyed by the force of the water and wind. A total of 6 deaths were recorded: 3 people in Giarre swept away by the waters, 2 in Acireale who drowned in their homes, and 1 in Mascali, dragged into a manhole by the waters. Additionally, the flood caused strong storm surges, which were the main cause of the tragedy involving the Greek ship Pelhunter: the ship, having left the port of Riposto around 7:45 PM, was suddenly hit by a strong storm surge 140 km off the coast, causing the immediate capsizing of the vessel carrying 15 people. Due to the extremely difficult communication conditions, rescue operations were activated only after 9:00 PM, and the ship was located only during the night, given the sea conditions at the time. In the Pelhunter shipwreck, 5 people died, 3 were rescued, and 7 were never found and were officially declared missing."

From August 19 to 20, under the influence of tropical storm Rumbia, the Mi River basin in Shandong experienced extremely heavy rainfall, causing water levels to rise significantly in the Yeyuan Reservoir, Tangshuiya Reservoir, and Heihushan Reservoir in Qingzhou and Linqu, leading to reservoir discharges. Although the reservoirs provided some warnings to downstream villagers, the time was only sufficient for residents to evacuate, leaving livestock and property behind. This event caused the Shouguang section of the Mi River to experience the largest flood peak since 1974, with multiple villages along the Shouguang riverbanks suffering from river water backflow, resulting in extensive damage to residential houses, farmland, greenhouses, and farms, potentially affecting the stability of vegetable supply to Beijing. During the same period as the Shouguang flood disaster, there was a continuous rise in vegetable prices nationwide, which drew attention from Xinhua News Agency. According to official statistics, as of 5 p.m. on the 23rd, the disaster caused 13 deaths, 3 missing persons, the collapse of 9,999 houses, and economic losses of approximately 9.2 billion yuan. Since the number of collapsed houses exceeded 10,000, the government was required to initiate a national level-4 response. The figure of 9,999 collapsed houses was questioned for being too coincidental, raising suspicions of falsification. Phoenix News published an article titled \"Shouguang Flood Disaster: 9,999 Houses Damaged, Where Are the Facts?\" questioning the data from the People's Daily client on August 23, which reported \"10,335 houses collapsed, 8,240 houses severely damaged, and 53,465 houses generally damaged.\" The article was later deleted."
