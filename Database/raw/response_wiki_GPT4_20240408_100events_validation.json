Minimal effects were also recorded in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Tennessee; though one fatality was reported in Delaware. The most significant effects, by far, occurred in Pennsylvania, mostly due to intense flooding. The hurricane severely flooded the Susquehanna River and the Lackawanna River causing major damage to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metropolitan area.

Caused by a lightning strike on August 15, the fire began near Cima Dome (a geological formation for which the fire was named) and exhibited rapid growth over the following 36 hours, aided by weather conditions and a lack of available firefighting resources. During this period the Dome Fire destroyed only 6 structures, but burned more than a quarter of the Cima Dome Joshua tree forest, one of the largest and densest populations of Joshua trees known in the world. The fire killed as many as 1.3 million Joshua trees. No injuries or fatalities were reported among firefighters or civilians. The fire cost US$2.2 million to suppress, and burned 43,273 acres (17,512 ha) before being fully contained on August 24.",

The monsoon season in south Asia typically starts around early June each year and brings heavy rainfall and potential flooding to nation. However, the 2019 monsoon season started in late June and has been unusually heavy in terms of rainfall, with a 6.5% increase in rainfall averaged across India. In the Pune district, prior to the flooding, it had received 180% of its annual rainfall for the year due to the monsoon season, and its local Khadakwasla dam along with other three important dams were filled completely. More than 16 centimetres (6.3 in) of rain was measured in Pune, Baramati and Pune district between the night of 25 September and the afternoon of 26 September which was the highest rainfall in last 10 years. Coupled with the existing rain from the previous months, flash floods started to occur. The flash flooding was caused by short intense periods of rainfall that overwhelmed water runoff systems like nullahs and flooded roads. The flood caused 21 deaths, 5 missing and evacuation of more than 28,000 people living in the city.",

Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered the greatest damage, as the rain was the heaviest in 120 years of recorded weather measurements.[10][11] By 20 May, at least 62 people had died as a result of the flooding, and hundreds of thousands had been forced from their homes. Towns of Obrenovac in Serbia and Doboj in Bosnia and Herzegovina account for most victims, after being inundated by several-meter high waters from nearby rivers.[12]",
            "On 13 May, a  low-pressure area formed over the Adriatic Sea, as polar air from Central Europe penetrated into the Mediterranean basin. The cold polar air mass met with humid subtropical air, leading to very low pressure. On 14 May, the low moved over Southeast Europe, becoming stationary. As a result, extremely heavy rain fell within the region; Serbia (in the area around Belgrade) and Bosnia were most affected.[18] Serbian and Bosnian meteorologists named the formed cyclone 'Tamara'.[19][20] On 15 May, the daily amounts of rainfall broke historical records in Belgrade (107.9 mm), Valjevo (108.2 mm) and Loznica (110 mm).[21] By 15 May, the monthly rainfall in Belgrade had broken the historical record (175 L from 1897), reaching 205 L.[22] By Saturday, May 17, the rain had subsided, and the weather gradually became warmer and sunnier, somewhat easing relief and rescue efforts. On 18 May, the cyclone moved further northwest.[20]"

An upper level anticyclone just to the northwest was enhancing pole ward outflow. During that day the disturbance developed further with improved convective banding in the northern quadrant, however interaction with land was a major hindrance. Early on May 1, the disturbance was designated as a Tropical Depression by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and the Japan Meteorological Agency, with PAGASA assigning the name Dante to the depression. Later that day PAGASA declared that Dante had made landfall on the Bicol Region in Southeastern Luzon. Later on May 2, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Dante to a Tropical Storm, with the JMA assigning the name of Kujira to the cyclone. During the next day Kujira quickly intensified due to favorable sea surface temperatures with the JMA upgrading it to a Severe Tropical Storm later that day, before becoming a Typhoon early on May 4 by both the JMA and the JTWC as animated infrared imagery was showing the development of an eye feature.",

The plan for the burn called for initial ignition ('phase 1') to be in the rincon, followed by flanking fires ('phase 2') along the slightly higher country east and west of Frijoles Creek. Ignition of the phase-1 burn was scheduled for May 4, 2000.",

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression that day. A day later, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration  (PAGASA) classified it as a tropical depression, naming it Maring. The cyclone was initially heavily disorganised, competing with another vortex, Tropical Depression Nando. Eventually, Maring became dominant, and the JMA reclassified it as a tropical storm, naming it Kompasu. Kompasu made landfall in Cagayan, Philippines, on 11 October 2021, and two days later, the storm made landfall in Hainan, China.
