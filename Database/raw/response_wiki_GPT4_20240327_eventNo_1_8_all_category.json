        "Perils_Assessment_With_Annotation": "The perils of Cyclone Monica included strong winds, as it was reported that wind gusts up to 148 km/h (92 mph) felled power lines in Maningrida. Additionally, heavy rainfall was associated with the storm, exceeding 400 mm (16 in) near where Monica made landfall. Minor coastal flooding was also reported due to Monica. The storm made landfall in the Northern Territory, causing significant damage in the region.",

Wind gusts up to 148 km/h (92 mph) felled power lines in Maningrida; 12 homes sustained damage from fallen trees in Jabiru; and extensive damage was reported in Gunbalanya (formerly known as Oenpelli)."

Torrential rain affected areas of Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba, with rainfall reaching more than 250 mm in some locations. The Ipswich and Marburg areas were the worst affected, whilst four homes in inner-city Paddington were unroofed. The Inner City Bypass was flooded and forced to close, as was the Moggill Ferry. Blackwater, near Emerald in Central Queensland, was hit hard by the third storm, with 20 houses sustaining roof damage and up to 100 more were damaged in some way.

        "Perils_Assessment_With_Annotation": "The 2021 Western North America heat wave was an extreme heat wave that affected much of Western North America from late June through mid-July 2021. The heat wave sparked numerous extensive wildfires, some reaching hundreds of square kilometers in area, which led to widespread disruption on the roads. The heat wave also caused extensive damage to crops across the region, which was seen as likely to result in higher food prices globally, though the losses have yet to be calculated. Soot from wildfires is further expected to diminish the mass of ice. As the surrounding air was extremely hot, water temperatures rose, which proved to be a hazard for aquatic wildlife. On the Pacific shore, temperatures in the intertidal zone reached up to 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C) and more than a billion seashore animals, like clams, barnacles and oysters, died as a result of heat wave, impacting water quality. Inland, the population of sockeye salmon in Idaho rivers was preventatively caught out of water as increasing temperatures made it prone to disease; some salmon was also transported to cooler waters in the Columbia River. Fish kill, however, was not prevented in Albertan aquifers and appeared earlier than expected. The heat wave caused an increase in vibrio bacteria levels in oysters in the Pacific Northwest, causing a record number of people to be sickened from vibriosis, an intestinal disease caused by the bacteria. The Washington State Department of Health urged people not to eat raw oysters and other shellfish from the region due to the risk of bacterial contamination.",

Hurricane-force wind gusts with near-hurricane-force sustained winds occurred in these areas. A peak two-minute sustained wind of 75 mph (121 km/h) and a gust to 92 mph (148 km/h) was observed at Cape Lookout. Tropical storm-force wind gusts extended as far as 100 mi (155 km) inland. Persistent onshore flow resulted in the entire coastline experiencing a storm surge of at least 1 ft (0.30 m). Surge was greatest along the interior Pamlico Sound, especially along the lower reaches of the Newport, Neuse, and Pamlico Rivers; however, the peak coincided with low tide. Heavy rain accompanied the storm's three-day impact, with the greatest totals occurring along the immediate coastline. Peak accumulations were concentrated in Brunswick County, reaching a maxima of 17.5 in (440 mm) at the Oak Island water treatment plant. Accumulations as much as 12 in (300 mm) extended northward to Oracoke Island. Trace amounts of rain fell across half the state. Rip currents were reported in coastal Delaware on September 16 to 17. The combination of onshore flow and a full moon led to minor coastal flooding in Cape May and Monmouth counties in New Jersey. From September 15 to 17, moisture brought north from Ophelia interacted with a cold front, leading to widespread heavy rain in the Northeast.",

        "Perils_Assessment_With_Annotation": "The floods were reported to have caused 50 deaths since 1 August and 8 deaths in the neighbouring state of Jharkhand. Soon after these floods, North Bengal also witnessed floods that wreaked havoc over the seven districts and killed 3 people. Heavy rain in last week of July & August resulted in flood in the state. The Land Depression 01 in its precursor low & poor maintenance of dams caused dangerous floods in West Bengal. State irrigation minister said that in some districts of south Bengal, there had been around 400 mm rainfall during the last three days. The rivers Silabati in West Midnapore, Dwarkeswar in Bankura, Dwaraka and Kuye in Birbhum were flowing above the danger level. Some villages at Suri block II got flooded due to incessant rain. Some parts of the Hooghly and West Midnapore, including Ghatal, Khirpai, Chandrakona went under water since Saturday night. Bankura recorded the state's highest rainfall at 274 mm during the same period, while Digha recorded 104 mm, Halisahar recorded 189 mm and Burdwan received 72.6 mm of rains. The water discharge from DVC dams was in excess of that in 1978 which saw an unprecedented flood in the state. So far 2.78 lakh (278 thousand) cusecs of water had been discharged by DVC as of 1 August. The situation in Bengal got worse on Thursday after Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) released more water from its dams and sounded a red alert in the lower catchment areas of the Damodar river. An additional 249,450 cusecs of water was released from Durgapur barrage on Thursday morning. As a result, more areas in east Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah were hit by flood. The flood affected districts had received record rainfall from 20 to 25 July.

A second more severe heatwave occurred in mid-July, extending north to the United Kingdom where temperatures surpassing 40\u00c2\u00b0C (104\u00c2\u00b0F) were recorded for the first time. The heatwaves were part of climate change in Europe. A third heatwave began in August with parts of France and Spain expected to reach temperatures as high as 38\u00c2\u00b0C (100\u00c2\u00b0F). A prolonged hot period also hit the United Kingdom. Although temperatures in most places in Europe subsided in August, a smaller heatwave impacted France on 12 September, with temperatures reaching 40.1\u00c2\u00b0C (104.2\u00c2\u00b0F). As a result of the heatwaves, widespread droughts occurred across the continent. Climatologists linked the extreme heat to the impact of climate change, and experts predict that changes in the jet stream as a result of climate change will cause heatwaves with increasing frequency in Europe.",

Parts of Corning were under more than 3 m of flood waters.",
            "Landfall": "After moving inland, Agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered Georgia. The weakening trend halted as the storm crossed over Georgia and into South Carolina. While over eastern North Carolina, Agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm on June 21, as a result of baroclinic activity. Early the following day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near New York City as a strong tropical storm."

Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane, no hurricane-force winds were reported. Along the coast abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage, especially between Apalachicola and Cedar Key. Light to moderate rainfall was reported in Florida, though no significant flooding occurred. In Georgia, damage was limited to two tornadoes, which caused approximately $275,000 in losses. Minimal effects were also recorded in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Tennessee; though one fatality was reported in Delaware. The most significant effects, by far, occurred in Pennsylvania, mostly due to intense flooding. The hurricane severely flooded the Susquehanna River and the Lackawanna River causing major damage to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metropolitan area. In both Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined, about 43,594 structures were either destroyed or significantly damaged. In Canada, a mobile home was toppled, killing two people."
