The storm has been described as one of the most devastating storm events during the 20th century. The storm developed over the UK where it caused some localised damage in the south before moving across the North Sea where it underwent explosive cyclogenesis dropping from 969 hPa to 953 hPa. This development was fueled by the contrast between cold air in the parent low and the warm water of the North Sea. The storm brought wind gusts of over 35 metres per second (130 km/h) to large areas of the Netherlands, with gusts over 40 m/s (140 km/h) across northern Germany. The greatest damage was reported across the German state of Lower Saxony, after which it is known in German as the Lower Saxony storm. The storm destroyed the K\u00f6nigs Wusterhausen Central Tower, a 243 m (797 ft) communications tower to the southwest of Berlin and the church steeple in Berlin-Friedrichshagen. The courtyard of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute headquarters in De Bilt features a representation of the pressure map of the Quimburga storm.",

Irma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30. Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale by late on August 31. The storm's intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles. On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.",

The sixth tropical cyclone and the second severe tropical cyclone of the 2020\u201321 Australian region cyclone season, while being the third severe tropical cyclone of the annual South Pacific cyclone season, Niran was the second Category 5 severe tropical cyclone in the South Pacific cyclone season, following Cyclone Yasa. The cyclone formed from a tropical low in the Coral Sea on 27 February. The tropical low gradually intensified while stalling offshore of Queensland for several days, although disorganized at the time. Early on 3 March, Niran pulled away from the coast of Australia, while it started undergoing rapid intensification. Eventually, Niran reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 tropical cyclone on both the Australian Tropical Cyclone Scale and the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, on 5 March, well offshore of Australia. Soon afterward, Niran initiated an eyewall replacement cycle and encountered some wind shear, causing the storm to weaken on 6 March, as it passed just to the south of Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. Afterwards, Niran continued rapidly weakening as wind shear increased further, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone late on 6 March. Niran was absorbed into another extratropical storm two days later.",

Though under the influence of moderate to strong wind shear, the system was able to strengthen, becoming Tropical Storm Fiona later that same day. On September 16, Fiona passed over Guadeloupe and entered the Caribbean Sea, where atmospheric conditions improved, and strengthened into a hurricane as it approached Puerto Rico two days later. A few hours afterward, the eye of Fiona made landfall along the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico, near Punta Tocon, between the municipalities of Lajas and Cabo Rojo. The hurricane made landfall in the Dominican Republic shortly thereafter, and then strengthened into the first major hurricane of the season. As the storm slowly moved through the Turks and Caicos, it continued to strengthen and reached Category 4 status the following day, while accelerating north. The storm reached peak 1-minute sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 931 mbar (27.49 inHg). After passing Bermuda and weakening to Category 3 intensity, Fiona quickly transitioned into a large and powerful extratropical cyclone and struck Nova Scotia with sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) early on September 24. Post-tropical Fiona then quickly weakened as it moved through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and over the southeastern Labrador Peninsula. The remnants then dissipated over the Labrador Sea near the southwest coast of Greenland on September 27.",

Following an assessment of the damage, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses.

The ninth depression, and the third and strongest named storm of the 2017 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Ockhi originated from an area of low pressure that formed over the southwest Bay of Bengal on November 28. The storm organized into a Depression off southeast coast of Sri Lanka on November 29, causing damage to property and life in Sri Lanka while passing by. Due to high atmospheric moisture and warmer oceanic surface temperature between Sri Lanka and Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) in mainland India, Ockhi intensified into a cyclonic storm on November 30. While near Kanyakumari in mainland India, Ockhi changed course and intensified while heading towards Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea. Ockhi impacted Lakshadweep on December 2, uprooting coconut trees and causing extensive damage to houses, power lines and other infrastructure on the islands. Ockhi weakened into a well-marked low near the south coast of Gujarat, India, on December 6, before crossing the coastline and dissipating shortly afterward. In its entirety, Ockhi left a trail of massive destruction in Sri Lanka, Lakshadweep, South India, and The Maldives, as it strengthened from a depression to a mature cyclone.",

The twelfth tropical cyclone and the eighth hurricane of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season, Alice developed on December 30, 1954, from a trough of low pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions. The storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status. After passing through the Leeward Islands on January 2, 1955, Alice reached peak winds of 90 mph (140 km/h) before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast. It dissipated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea. Alice was the first of two Atlantic tropical cyclones to exist in two calendar years, the other being 2005's Zeta. The hurricane was also one of only six tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist in the month of January, with the most recent being an unnamed subtropical cyclone in 2023.",

The storm first hit the Oklahoma panhandle and northwestern Oklahoma and moved south for the day. The conditions were the most severe in the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, but the storm's effects were also felt in surrounding areas. Drought, erosion, bare soil, and winds caused the dust to fly freely and at high speeds. Cattle farming and sheep ranching had left much of the west devoid of natural grass and shrubs to anchor the soil, over-farming and poor soil stewardship left the soil dehydrated and lacking in organic matter. A drought hit the United States in the 1930s, and the lack of rainfall, snowfall, and moisture in the air dried out the topsoil in most of the country's farming regions.",

One person was injured, and initially there were reports of two people missing due to the storm; however, it was not later confirmed. The storm brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico, peaking at 6.35 inches (161 mm) in La Villita, Michoac\u00e1n. Flooding from four days of rainfall caused officials to close schools in and around Acapulco. The rainfall resulted in downed trees and mudslides. About 150 homes became flooded, resulting in military personnel to assist in evacuating the flooded houses. In total, 20 homes were destroyed, and 20 villages were left without power. A transport vehicle carrying 15 people was swept away by a flooded stream, resulting in one injury; the truck was later rescued by police workers. About 300 hectares (740 acres) of crop fields sustained damage; however, little crop damage was reported, as the storm occurred after harvesting had ended.

The floods were caused by above average rainfall, which was attributed to Typhoon Utor (2006) which had hit the Philippines and Vietnam a few days earlier. By the third week of January 2007, Johor had been affected by a larger flood. Singapore and certain parts of Indonesia were flooded due to the same typhoon. Throughout the week starting 18 December 2006, a series of floods hit Johor, Malacca, Pahang and Negeri Sembilan. During this period, these southern Malaysian states, along with Singapore, experienced abnormally high rainfall which resulted in massive floods. The rainfall recorded in the city of Johor Bahru on 19 December amounted to 289mm compared to the average annual rainfall of the city which is 2400mm. In Singapore, the 24-hour rainfall recorded on 20 December was 366 mm, the third highest recorded rainfall in 75 years. The flooding began when torrential downpours since Sunday caused rivers and dams to overflow. Weather officials described the flooding as the worst in the area in a century. Later that week, beginning 22 December, North Sumatra experienced abnormally high rainfall which also caused flooding. The floods affected areas such as Aceh and North Sumatra, leaving many homeless. The floods lasted for a week starting on December 22. An estimated 400,000 people were displaced at the peak of the flooding with at least 118 people dead and 155 people missing as of 29 December 2006.",

This severe weather/tornado event affected the United States Gulf Coast and southern East Coast over a two-day span. It occurred in conjunction with a much larger winter storm event that brought blizzard conditions to much of the interior United States. In total, 31 tornadoes were confirmed by the National Weather Service in five states from Texas to North Carolina. All but one of the tornadoes that occurred during the outbreak touched down on December 25, with the other occurring the following day in North Carolina. Two of the tornadoes were destructive enough to be rated EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. At least 16 people died as a result of the related blizzard, and thousands were without power.",

The sixth named storm of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Fernand developed from a broad area of low pressure that was first monitored in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on August 31. Gradual organization ensued as the low moved westward, and it developed into a tropical depression early on September 3. The cyclone quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Fernand six hours after formation, and attained peak winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) early on September 4. However, easterly wind shear and the cyclone's close proximity to the Mexican coast prevented further development, and Fernand weakened slightly before making landfall along the coast of northeastern Mexico at 15:15 UTC September 4. Fernand quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it moved over the Sierra Madre Oriental, and by 03:00 UTC on September 5, the cyclone had dissipated over the rugged terrain of Mexico.",

As it crossed the country, its strongest rainfall was east of the center, and the depression failed to intensify beyond winds of 30 mph (45 km/h).

The floods left widespread areas without electricity or communications. Six bridges were destroyed in central and western Cuba, which, in addition to damaged roads and rail lines, severely disrupted the country's transportation infrastructure. A total of 131 roads were unpassable due to the flooding, and 55 rail lines were damaged. The flood waters prompted officials to evacuate 65,000 residents in low-lying areas, including using helicopters and amphibious vehicles. A tornado was reported in the city of Camag\u00fcey, destroying five Soviet planes and several buildings. By the day after the depression dissipated, the Cuban government reported nine deaths, although the death toll was later finalized at 37. The depression also killed thousands of livestock.

After weakening to tropical storm status, Kenneth attained a steady west-northwest motion and encountered favorable enough conditions for it to gain power and attain hurricane status on September 25.

In Val Verde County, Texas, which took the vast majority of the damage, roughly 2000 houses, mobile homes, and apartments combined were destroyed by flooding. At one point, two-thirds of Del Rio was underwater after a natural dam broke in the San Felipe Creek, flooding the city with a sudden surge of water. The coastal storm surge destroyed several of the dunes on San Jose and Mustang Islands. There was also slight damage on Matagorda Island, where two shelters were destroyed by the surge flooding. Four people, including two toddlers, died when their truck was swept away by floodwaters and nine more drowned in flooding along the San Felipe Creek. Thirteen people died in Texas, all drownings.

In Maui, the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages, significantly increasing the total water across the island's reservoirs.

The storm dropped its heaviest snow of 12 to 24 inches (30 to 61 cm) (locally as much as 36 inches (91 cm)) across a wide area of interior New England, New York, and Pennsylvania. The storm also brought flooding rains to coastal sections of New England, with some areas experiencing as much as 4 inches (10 cm). Aside from precipitation, the nor'easter brought hurricane-force sustained winds to coastal New England. This storm was a complex combination of multiple systems, including an upper air low from the northern Great Plains states, and a surface low from the Gulf Coast states. As the surface low tracked northeast from the coast of North Carolina, the upper air low transferred its energy to it, eventually enabling the new storm to undergo rapid intensification near the shore of eastern Long Island. A strong blocking regime of high pressure over the Canadian Maritime provinces prevented the storm system from exiting to the east. This resulted in a cutoff low (not influenced by the predominant jet stream currents), which took a highly unusual track, retrograding west into New York state before looping back out to sea.",

Typhoon Nina originated from an area of convection near the Marshall Islands in mid-November 1987. It gradually became better organized, and on November 19, was first classified as a tropical cyclone. Moving west-northwest, Nina attained tropical storm intensity that evening. Late on November 20, Nina passed through the Chuuk Lagoon in the Federated States of Micronesia. After a brief pause in intensification, Nina intensified into a typhoon on November 22. Two days later, the typhoon intensified suddenly, before attaining its peak 10 minute intensity of 165 km/h (105 mph; 90 kn). During the afternoon of November 25, Nina moved ashore in Southern Luzon at the same intensity. It gradually weakened over land, before entering the South China Sea and turning to the north. By November 30, Nina dissipated.",

During this time, Fanapi intensified to reach 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (109 mph). Fanapi made its first landfall on September 19 over Hualien, Taiwan, becoming the first typhoon to hit the island since Typhoon Morakot in August 2009. Later that day made a final landfall in Fujian, China. The storm dissipated on September 21 over southern China.",

It moved westward and passed about 55 km (34 mi) north of Saipan on August 31 as an intensifying typhoon. On the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to super typhoon status, with winds equivalent to that of a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. The Japan Meteorological Agency estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175 km/h (109 mph) on September 02. Nabi weakened while curving to the north, striking the Japanese island of Kyushu on September 06.

The eleventh tropical cyclone and sixth hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season, Klaus developed from a tropical wave on October 3 a short distance east of Dominica. It drifted northwestward, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on October 5. Though its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles was within 12 miles (19 km), the strongest winds remained to its northeast due to strong wind shear, which caused Klaus to steadily weaken. After deteriorating into a tropical depression, Klaus briefly restrengthened over the Bahamas before dissipating on October 9 under the influence of developing tropical storm, Marco.",

Heavy rainfall on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties occurred and 1,500 people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; the same area was affected with more precipitation a few days later by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to the impact Klaus had on Martinique, the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.",

Originating from a tropical wave over the central Atlantic on September 6, Maria moved toward the west and slowly strengthened. While approaching the northern Leeward Islands, however, the system entered a region of higher vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures, causing it to degenerate into a low-pressure area. It slowly curved toward the north and northeast around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and regained tropical storm status on September 10. Maria further strengthened to attain hurricane status while making its closest approach to Bermuda. The cyclone attained peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on September 16, but weakened thereafter because of an increase in wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. Maria made landfall on the southeastern coast of Newfoundland during the afternoon hours of September 16 before becoming absorbed by a frontal system later on that same day.",

Amid favorable environmental conditions, Jebi quickly strengthened into a typhoon on August 29 as it headed west and rapidly intensified as it passed the Northern Mariana Islands on August 30. Jebi reached its peak intensity as a Category 5-equivalent typhoon on August 31, with 10-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 285 km/h (180 mph), and a minimum pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg). Afterwards, Jebi began a slow weakening trend as it turned northwest, briefly passing through the Philippine Area of Responsibility on September 2. Jebi accelerated north-northeast towards Japan on September 3 as it interacted with the westerlies, and made landfalls over Shikoku and near Kobe early on September 4. Jebi quickly weakened over land and became an extratropical cyclone later that day over the Sea of Japan.",

Between 1 and 2 April, the storm quickly intensified and attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. After turning to the southeast, the storm underwent an extratropical transition as it neared Cape Leeuwin. The storm brushed the cape on 4 April, bringing hurricane-force winds, before rapidly losing its identity the following day. In Western Australia, the combination of Alby's fast movement and hurricane-force winds caused widespread damage. Along the coast, large swells flooded low-lying areas and numerous homes lost their roofs from high winds. Further inland, bushfires were worsened by the storm as it brought little rain, generally less than 20 mm (0.79 in) along the coast. These fires burned roughly 114,000 hectares (281,700 acres) and destroyed two towns. Five fatalities are attributed to Alby and the associated brushfires.

        "Main_Event_Assessment_With_Annotation": "Cyclone Anne was a European windstorm which caused \u20ac75 million in damage across western Europe in early January 2014. The low pressure system was named Anne by the Free University of Berlin on 1 January. The Anne storm was deepened by the powerful jet stream, one of a series of lows which deepened below 950hPa. Meteo France issued an orange alert in Brittany for the departments of Morbihan and Ille-et-Vilaine, the warning level was raised to red for the department of Finist\u00e8re. The Jersey Met Office gave out a red alert, its highest level of warning. The Isle of Man Government issued a red warning (the highest) for Friday 3 January, advising that water levels were expected to be 800mm above harbour walls. The Channel Islands saw wind gusts reach 87 miles per hour (140 km/h) on Alderney, with gusts of 75 miles per hour (121 km/h) in Jersey. The storm brought heavy showers, with reports of large hail and lightning strikes causing damage. Coastal areas from Brittany to Scotland along the south and west coasts of Britain saw high seas. In Ireland coastal flooding was worst in the south and west of the country, but some flooding was noted on all coasts. In France, Quimperl\u00e9, Finistere flooded again, after previously flooding during Cyclone Dirk in December 2013. Flooding was also reported in Morlaix and Quimper. Coastal flooding was expected to be worst in the South West of England in Cornwall and Devon. The Environment Agency estimated that 130 homes had been flooded in England, with flood defences serving to protect 130,000 properties. Widespread coastal flooding and damage occurred in Ireland. Flooding was reported in Cork and County Cork. Flooding began in Cork on 2 January evening tide at 17:45. Clare County Council described the promenade at Lahinch as 'seriously compromised' following the storm. In Northern Ireland parts of Coleraine in County Londonderry were flooded after the River Bann overflowed, several coastal roads around the region were closed because of flooding. The Isle of Man Government said low-lying port areas were affected, with parts of Ramsey losing electricity, though damage appeared minimal. On the Welsh coast 100 residents were evacuated from vulnerable homes in Borth and Aberystwyth. Aberystwyth was hit by destructive high waves for the second time this winter, after it was hit by a storm which followed the St. Jude storm on 2\u20133 November 2013. Damage occurred to sea defences and gardens at St Bees, Cumbria. The Somerset levels saw an increase in water levels, with the Environment Agency bringing in extra pumps to try and manage the water on the flooded moors, which was being hampered as the Agency had to wait for river levels to drop. The storm's impacts came on the day when the British Government announced that the Environment Agency in the UK would shed 1500 jobs (approximately a tenth of its staff) political questions were raised about the ability of the Agency to deal with future floods. Initial assessments by Irish local authorities put damage in millions of euros.",

It gradually curved to the northwest and later to the north, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge created by Hurricane Floyd. Hurricane Gert passed east of Bermuda on September 21 and began a steady weakening trend at that time. It turned to the northeast, and on September 23, Gert transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the southeast of Atlantic Canada before being absorbed by a larger storm.",

Moving towards the north, Orlene gradually strengthened, becoming a hurricane on October 1 and reaching its peak intensity the following day with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). Orlene made landfall just north of the Nayarit and Sinaloa border, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Soon afterward, Orlene rapidly weakened and became a tropical depression, eventually dissipating over the Sierra Madre Occidental late on October 4. Orlene prompted the issuance of hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings for Northwestern Mexico. The storm's knocked out power to nearly 49,092 customers in two states. Orlene caused minor damage to many schools. Damage in San Blas was estimated to be in excess of MX$12 million (US$600,000).",

Throughout its lifespan, the storm caused 52 direct deaths and roughly US$740 million in damage to crops and infrastructure, primarily in Guatemala. The precursor tropical depression formed on September 3 in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and neared tropical storm intensity before making landfall near Salina Cruz, Mexico, on the next day. Though the depression quickly weakened to a remnant low, the disturbance crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and tracked north into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where it reorganized into a tropical cyclone once again on September 5. There, the system quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and received the name Hermine before moving ashore near Matamoros, Mexico on September 7 as a high-end tropical storm. Over the next few days, Hermine weakened as it moved over the U.S. Southern Plains, eventually dissipating over Kansas on September 10. In all, the storm resulted in eight fatalities, seven in Texas and one in Oklahoma, as well as an estimated $240 million in damage.",

It slowly organised as it moved southwards, and became a tropical storm as it turned west on 13 January. Berguitta then rapidly intensified to achieve its peak intensity on 15 January while stalling north of Rodrigues. At the time, the cyclone possessed 10-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), and a minimum central pressure of 960 hPa (28.35 inHg). Berguitta weakened as it moved slowly west-southwestwards on 16 January, and the cyclone degraded to a tropical storm by 17 January. It accelerated southwestwards over Mauritius and R\u00e9union on 18 January, before degenerating to a post-tropical cyclone the next day. The remnants of Berguitta transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated over the Indian Ocean on 24 January.",

The storm further intensified into a Category 3 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). By August 23, the hurricane nearly stalled while interacting with Tropical Storm Irwin. Executing a small counter-clockwise loop, Hilary degraded to tropical storm intensity and took a northerly track for the remainder of its existence. The storm made two landfalls in Mexico, one in Baja California Sur on August 25 and one in Sonora the following day. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for much of the southern Mexican coastline; however, they were later discontinued when the threat ended, but were issued again when the system posed a threat to the Baja California Peninsula. Hilary dropped in excess of 5 in (130 mm) rain along its path in some areas, and flash flooding in California and Iowa.",

The system was first identified over the Solomon Islands as a tropical low on 1 April 2014, and gradually moved westward, eventually reaching cyclone intensity on 5 April. On 10 April, Ita intensified rapidly into a powerful Category 5 system on the Australian Scale, but it weakened to a Category 4 system in the hours immediately preceding landfall the following day. At the time of landfall at Cape Flattery at 12 April 22:00 (UTC+10), the cyclone's Dvorak intensity was approximately T5.0, consistent with a weak Category 4 system, and considerably lower than the T6.5 observed when the system was at its peak intensity. Meteorologists noted the system had, at that time, begun an eyewall replacement cycle; as a result, the system was considerably less powerful than various intensity scales had predicted. As a result, Ita's impact on terrain was lessened.",

Some people were buried under rocks and debris due to mudslides. Huts and rice feels were inundated by mud in debris in parts of Legaspi, Daragan, Ligao, and Camalig. The towns of Ligao, Oas, Camalig and Guinobatan were the worst affected by Kelly. Although winds were not very strong, many rivers overflowed their banks. In the Albay Province, more than 1,450 km (900 mi) of railways lines were washed out. Over 800 dwellings were destroyed, including 597 houses made of light wood and straw, were destroyed and 9,500 acres (3,845 ha) of rice field were destroyed. More than 3,600 persons lost their homes. One hundred ninety-two fatalities were reported, including 120 casualties in the Albay Province and five in Ligao. Nine cities sustained fatalities near the Mayon volcano. Twelve children also died. Nine individuals were also listed missing and 30 were injured. Most of the fatalities were due to drownings. Overall, damage totaled to $7.8 million, including $3.7 million from infrastructure.

The storm has been described as one of the most devastating storm events during the 20th century. The storm developed over the UK where it caused some localised damage in the south before moving across the North Sea where it underwent explosive cyclogenesis dropping from 969 hPa to 953 hPa. This development was fueled by the contrast between cold air in the parent low and the warm water of the North Sea. The storm brought wind gusts of over 35 metres per second (130 km/h) to large areas of the Netherlands, with gusts over 40 m/s (140 km/h) across northern Germany. The greatest damage was reported across the German state of Lower Saxony, after which it is known in German as the Lower Saxony storm. The storm destroyed the K\u00f6nigs Wusterhausen Central Tower, a 243 m (797 ft) communications tower to the southwest of Berlin and the church steeple in Berlin-Friedrichshagen. The courtyard of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute headquarters in De Bilt features a representation of the pressure map of the Quimburga storm.",

On 28 October, the system organized even further and intensified, which prompted forecast offices in Europe to name the low. Italy's 'Servizio Meteorologico' named the storm Apollo (which was then adopted by the Free University of Berlin),[7] while Greece named the storm Nearchus.[2] On 29 October 2021, a ship in the Mediterranean Sea passed through Apollo and measured a peak wind speed of 104 km/h (65 mph) and a pressure of 999.4 mb (29.51 inHg), indicating that Apollo was still strengthening.[8] After Apollo made its closest approach to Sicily during the overnight hours of 29 October, Apollo appeared to have begun to weaken as its convection waned and its low-level circulation became exposed on visible satellite imagery on 30 October 2021.[9][10] On 31 October 2021, Apollo made landfall near Bayda and stayed inland until emerging over the Mediterranean a few hours later.[11] On 2 November 2021, Apollo dissipated inland over Turkey.[12][13]",

Though under the influence of moderate to strong wind shear, the system was able to strengthen, becoming Tropical Storm Fiona later that same day. On September 16, Fiona passed over Guadeloupe and entered the Caribbean Sea, where atmospheric conditions improved, and strengthened into a hurricane as it approached Puerto Rico two days later. A few hours afterward, the eye of Fiona made landfall along the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico, near Punta Tocon, between the municipalities of Lajas and Cabo Rojo. The hurricane made landfall in the Dominican Republic shortly thereafter, and then strengthened into the first major hurricane of the season. As the storm slowly moved through the Turks and Caicos, it continued to strengthen and reached Category 4 status the following day, while accelerating north. The storm reached peak 1-minute sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 931 mbar (27.49 inHg). After passing Bermuda and weakening to Category 3 intensity, Fiona quickly transitioned into a large and powerful extratropical cyclone and struck Nova Scotia with sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) early on September 24. Post-tropical Fiona then quickly weakened as it moved through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and over the southeastern Labrador Peninsula. The remnants then dissipated over the Labrador Sea near the southwest coast of Greenland on September 27.",

        "Main_Event_Assessment_With_Annotation": "Tropical Storm Josephine was an unusual Atlantic tropical storm that moved from west to east across the Gulf of Mexico in October 1996. It formed on October 4 as a tropical depression from the remnants of a cold front. Early in its duration, the system interacted with a ridge over the central United States, which produced strong winds and high tides along the Texas coast. The outer rainbands caused flooding rainfall in southern Texas, and in Louisiana, high tides flooded roads and stranded residents on Grand Isle. Moving generally to the east due to a trough, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on October 6, and the next day reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) while approaching the west coast of Florida. Josephine made landfall in Taylor County near peak intensity early on October 8, and soon after became extratropical. While moving ashore, the storm produced a high storm surge reaching 9.3 ft (2.8 m) in Suwannee. High tides flooded about 3,600 houses along the west coast. Josephine also produced heavy rainfall, which flooded hundreds of homes, and high winds, which left 400,000 people without power. The storm also spawned at least 16 tornadoes, one of which damaged 130 homes. The extratropical remnants of Josephine moved along the eastern coast of the United States, producing wind gusts as strong as 77 mph (124 km/h) in St. Mary's County and in Ocean City, Maryland. The winds caused widespread power outages, including 26,000 in Virginia and 31,000 in New Jersey. Heavy rainfall flooded low-lying areas and rivers along the storm's path, including in North Carolina which had previously been affected by hurricanes Bertha and Fran earlier in the year. In the southeastern United States, the storm contributed to dozens of traffic accidents, which killed a person each in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. Damage throughout the United States totaled about $130 million (1996 USD). Josephine later moved offshore, and after passing southeast of Cape Cod, moved through Atlantic Canada with moderate rainfall and gusty winds. The storm later restrengthened in the northern Atlantic Ocean before merging with another extratropical storm near Iceland on October 16.",

With an estimated 235 deaths, it is the world's 10th deadliest winter storm on record. The blizzard came unexpectedly on a relatively warm day, and many people were caught unaware, including children in one-room schoolhouses. What made the storm so deadly was the timing (during work and school hours), the suddenness of the storm, and the brief spell of warmer weather that preceded it. In addition, the very strong wind fields behind the cold front and the powdery nature of the snow reduced visibilities on the open plains to zero. People ventured from the safety of their homes to do chores, go to town, attend school, or simply enjoy the relative warmth of the day. As a result, thousands of people \u2014 including many schoolchildren \u2014 got caught in the blizzard. The death toll was 235, though some estimate 1,000. Teachers generally kept children in their schoolrooms. Exceptions nearly always resulted in disaster. This cold front was so self-reinforced that it dropped temperatures as far south as Veracruz, Mexico, before dissipating.",

The thirteenth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Caribbean during late September 2008. Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 998 millibar (hPa; 29.47 inHg). Due to its small size, Marco caused minimal damage; however, the storm's heavy rains led to floods up to 10 feet (3.05 m) deep that covered highways and damaged homes. Upon landfall, heavy rains peaking at 7.9 inches (201 millimeters) in El Pujal, San Luis Potos\u00ed and falling at rates up to 1 inch per hour (25.4 mm/h), caused some flooding in coastal towns near Veracruz as people evacuated to higher ground. The rains from Marco worsened flood situations in areas of Mexico already suffering from severe flooding. Officials in Veracruz, in their post-storm damage survey, reported that two rivers, the Quilate and Tenoch, overflowed their banks due to rains produced by Marco. One of these rivers left the towns of Minatitlan and Hidalgotitlan under 10 ft (3 m) of water. Highways along the coast of Veracruz were also flooded. Another 250 homes were flooded when a lake and a river overflowed their banks. Thirteen municipalities within Veracruz were affected by Marco. In Vega de Alatorre, 77 people were evacuated to nearby shelters after their homes were inundated with water. In all, Marco's impact was light; minimal damage was recorded, and none of the estimated 400,000 people affected by the storm sustained injury.",

It was the fifth longest-lasting intense Atlantic hurricane, as measured by accumulated cyclone energy, since reliable records began in 1966. Sam was the eighteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Sam originated from a tropical wave that departed from the western coast of Africa on September 19. The system developed into a tropical depression on September 22, as upper-level winds gradually became more favorable. Intensification was initially slow, with the depression strengthening into Tropical Storm Sam a day later. Soon afterward, the structure of the cyclone quickly improved and rapid intensification began. Sam strengthened into a hurricane on September 24, and reached Category 4 status late on September 25. Sam peaked on September 26 as a high-end Category 4 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (249 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 927 mbar (27.4 inHg). Sam completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone on October 5, after which its remnants meandered over the northern Atlantic, near Iceland and Greenland, before being absorbed by another extratropical system on October 7.",

It was the third known hurricane of the 1893 Atlantic hurricane season. The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the Lesser Antilles. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the Caribbean Sea, and on August 17 struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The eye crossed the island from southeast to northwest in about seven hours, causing widespread destruction, particularly along the northern coast. The hurricane then began to turn northeastward, accelerate, and gradually weaken, impacting the U.S. East Coast and ultimately making landfall in Nova Scotia as an extratropical cyclone.",

Tropical cyclone Seroja struck Australia over the period of 11 to 12 April 2021, making landfall just south of the town of Kalbarri at 8.00pm local time on the 11th. Cyclone Seroja caused strong winds to impact an area of approximately 800km of the Mid-West Australia region coastline. Wind gusts extended further inland as cyclone Seroja continued a south-south-easterly track into the morning of 12th April and the highest gust speeds were recorded in the town of Kalbarri which reported wind speeds of 170km/h, while other locations in the region experienced gusts above 125km/h. PERILS notes that cyclone Seroja was a comparably \u201cdry\u201d event with moderate rainfall, meaning that most of the damage from came from the storms strong winds. Darryl Pidcock, Head of PERILS Asia-Pacific, said, \u201cSeroja was an unusual event both from a meteorological and an insurance perspective. Meteorologically, the event was special due to a phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect whereby Seroja interacted with another cyclone named Odette. This interaction pushed Seroja further south along the Western Australian coastline to make landfall at an unusually high intensity for the given latitude.",

The drought was set in motion by the weather phenomenon La Ni\u00f1a which developed during 2005. La Ni\u00f1a caused dry weather across much of the Southeast, this was evident due to the fact that winter 2005\u201306 was dry for much of the region. On top of that, the Bermuda High, also known as the Azores High, a hot and dry air mass over the Atlantic, formed unusually far west, and blocked storms from entering the region, a pattern that wouldn't break until 2008. The dryness continued into 2006. However, it was mild in comparison in 2007 and did not cause too many effects. Following that, 2007 was very dry across the Southeastern U.S. receiving record-low rainfall during the year. Mississippi and Georgia each had their driest spring on record, where spring typically is very wet across the region. The following summer was scorching hot and dry across the region with record-breaking wildfires across the region. In fact, August 2007 would end up being the warmest August and second-hottest month of any month across the region. with Knoxville, Tennessee having a daily maximum temperature above 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) on 16 days that month, and an all-time record.. High temperatures were still in the 90s \u00b0F (32+ \u00b0C) as far late as the end of October. The drought peaked in October, with over 70% of the Southeast in D4 or the worst category of drought, known as exceptional. 2007 would be the second-driest year as a whole over the region. North Carolina had its driest calendar year ever; several towns nearly ran out of water. The Bermuda High retreated out into the Atlantic and heavy winter rains during 2007\u201308 helped alleviate drought, a wet 2008 improved drought across most of the region; however, parts of Western North Carolina remained in drought until 2009. It is estimated that the drought caused an economic loss over the region at $1.3 billion and water shortages caused the first importing of water in 100 years, and crops failed across the region, causing catastrophic impacts.",

Despite initially being forecast to make landfall in the state of Gujarat, Vayu turned abruptly to the west on 13 June and moved away from the coast. The system weakened gradually as it tracked slowly towards the Arabian Peninsula, then weakened more quickly after beginning to accelerate back towards India on 16 June. Vayu was downgraded to a deep depression the following morning, and further to a depression a few hours later. The system degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure area late on 17 June, just before crossing the Gujarat coast.
