    "Main_Event_Assessment_With_Annotation": "The 1933 Texas tropical storm produced record rainfall in the south-central United States in July of the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the third storm of the season, developing on July 14 near the Lesser Antilles. While moving westward through the Caribbean Sea, the cyclone passed just south of Jamaica on July 16. The storm dropped heavy rainfall on the island that caused flooding and road washouts. On July 18, the storm struck Belize and later moved across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Initially it was believed that the storm continued into Mexico and dissipated while another storm formed to its northeast, but it was discovered in 2012 that the storm followed one continuous track. On July 23, the storm struck southeastern Texas at its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h). It moved inland and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Turning eastward, the storm dropped torrential rainfall in eastern Texas and western Louisiana, peaking at 21.3 in (540 mm) in Logansport, Louisiana. Several stations reported record rainfall, including Shreveport, Louisiana where its 24\u2011hour amount remained the highest daily total as of 2008. High rains left about $1.5 million in crop damage between two Texas counties. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, forcing evacuations and road closures. Despite being a weak tropical cyclone, the storm dropped heavy rainfall in eastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana. Some areas received 5.9 in (150 mm) in as little as six hours, and about 50,000 sq mi (130,000 km2) reported 10.4 in (260 mm). The highest rainfall total was 21.3 in (540 mm) in Logansport, Louisiana. High rains in eastern Texas, totaling over 10 in (250 mm), flooded roads in Shelby and Panola counties; damage in the two counties collectively totaled $1.5 million. Storm-related flooding washed out a bridge in Henderson and portions of the Santa Fe Railway line between Carthage and Longview. Five people required rescue after being trapped in a fast-moving river. The rains in the region were considered the heaviest in 17 years, and leaving severe damage to corn, cotton, and watermelon crops. Similarly, the floods damaged cotton and other crops in northern Louisiana, totaling several million dollars in losses. The rains caused many streams to exceed their banks, including one creek near Converse that flooded roads and railways. The floods forced families to evacuate in low-lying areas of northern Louisiana. The rainfall in Shreveport caused the worst floods related to a tropical cyclone on record. While the storm was dropping heavy rainfall, it produced thunderstorms and gusty winds along the Texas and Louisiana coastlines. A severe thunderstorm related to the storm damaged roofs and windows in Alexandria, Louisiana.",

It moved westward through the Caribbean, intensifying into a tropical storm on October 5 south of Puerto Rico, and into a hurricane on the following day. While passing south of the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides, killing eight people. Later, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica, where it destroyed two houses. On reaching the western Caribbean Sea, Iris rapidly intensified into a Category 4 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. A small hurricane with an eye of only 7 mi (11 km) in diameter, Iris reached peak winds of 145 mph (233 km/h) before making landfall in southern Belize near Monkey River Town on October 9. The hurricane quickly dissipated over Central America, although its remnants contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Manuel in the eastern Pacific Ocean.",

However the highway was reopened later that evening.[5][6] An evacuation warning was issued as of 6:30 p.m., that day, for Highland Home Road east to Highway 243, as well as the communities of Poppet Flats and Silent Valley.[6] Late Monday, many residents across the Inland area received an emergency alert via their cellphones telling them to \u201cevacuate now.\u201d However, the sending of that warning was in fact an error.[2] At 11:45 pm, 8 hours after the fires ignition, Cal Fire reported the fire to be 5,000 acres in size.[1] Overnight, the fire advanced toward the Silver Fire burn area of August 2013 where it would later burn itself out.[7]",

The wave tracked swiftly westward with little development, emerging into the eastern Pacific on July 01. The wave interacted with a larger area of low pressure on July 02, leading to an increase in convective coverage and the formation of a broad low-pressure area. Continuing slowly westward, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on July 04, while centered 205 mi (330 km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Despite the initially exposed center of circulation, a byproduct of moderate wind shear, the depression soon began to organize as convective banding increased and gained more curvature. This led to the classification of Tropical Storm Erick at 0000 UTC on July 05. The remnant circulation dissipated a few hours later, southwest of Baja California Sur.",

The disturbance quickly developed into Tropical Depression Five early on September 1 roughly 715 mi (1,150 km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, before strengthening into Tropical Storm Danielle by 12:00 UTC. Favorable conditions such as abnormally warm seas and light wind shear allowed Danielle to become a hurricane around 24 hours later. The hurricane stalled on September 2, caught south of a blocking high, and weakened back to a tropical storm the next day due to upwelling of cooler waters. Later, the storm drifted westward, where it again strengthened into a hurricane early on September 4. After turning northwestward, Danielle reached its peak intensity with sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) late the following day.[42] It then moved over a relatively cool part of the Gulf Stream and weakened to a low-end Category 1 hurricane.[64] The hurricane briefly re-intensified when it moved over marginally warm waters on September 7, but resumed a weakening trend shortly thereafter.[65] Danielle weakened to a tropical storm early on September 8, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day.

Quickly strengthening, the system attained tropical cyclone status on 20 January and later reached severe tropical cyclone intensity on 21 January as it approached Western Australia. Late on 21 January, Magda made landfall in the Kimberley region with winds of 130 km/h (81 mph) before quickly weakening over land. The remnants of Magda persisted until 24 January, at which time they dissipated east of Port Hedland. Prior to Cyclone Magda's arrival, several severe weather warnings were issued for the coastline of Western Australia. Although the storm made landfall with winds of 130 km/h (81 mph), damage was limited due to the sparsely populated region it struck. The most severe damage was defoliation around Kuri Bay. Following its usage, the name Magda was retired and replaced with Megan, which was first used in the 2023-24 season.",

The system was well organized and classified as Tropical Depression 18W on September 29. At the same day, it gained the name Phanfone due to very favorable conditions and intense thunderstorms rich with convection surrounding the storm's center. Phanfone would later go rapid intensification on October 1 due to warm sea-surface temperatures and very favorable environments. JTWC upgraded Phanfone to a Category 4 typhoon but weakened later back to Category 3 due to its eye replacing the old one and undergoing a minor eyewall replacement cycle. Phanfone later entered the PAR, assigning the name Neneng. It left several hours later, maintaining its Category 3 strength. On October 4, Phanfone reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 super typhoon before steadily weakening. The typhoon later made landfall at Hamamatsu, Japan at the time of its extratropical transition. The system later moved over Southwestern Alaska and dissipated on October 12.",

The third named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Cristobal formed on July 19 from a trough of low pressure off the Southeast U.S. Coast. In a marginally favorable environment, it attained minimal tropical storm status later that day. The storm remained offshore, and peaked as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras. It accelerated northeast parallel to the East Coast and became extratropical on July 23 near Nova Scotia. Because it was a weak storm and never made landfall, Cristobal's effects were mostly limited to moderate rainfall. The storm dropped 3.43 in (87 mm) of rain in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding was reported. Additionally, the extratropical remnants contributed to rainfall on Nova Scotia which caused some street and basement flooding.",

A day later, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration  (PAGASA) classified it as a tropical depression, naming it Maring. The cyclone was initially heavily disorganised, competing with another vortex, Tropical Depression Nando. Eventually, Maring became dominant, and the JMA reclassified it as a tropical storm, naming it Kompasu. Kompasu made landfall in Cagayan, Philippines, on 11 October 2021, and two days later, the storm made landfall in Hainan, China.

Typhoon Alex developed from the monsoon trough that spawned a tropical disturbance late on July 21 southwest of Guam which organized into a tropical depression shortly thereafter. The system steadily became better organized, and the next day, a tropical depression had developed. Satellite intensity estimates gradually increased, and on July 23, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alex. After initially tracking west-northwest, Tropical Storm Alex started tracking northwest. An eye developed on July 24, and on the next day, Alex was classified as a typhoon, when Alex attained its peak intensity of 120 km/h (75 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970 hPa (29 inHg). Alex weakened while tracking more northward, though interaction with Taiwan resulted in a more westward track starting on July 27. The storm struck near Shanghai as a tropical storm, and weakened over land, although it remained identifiable through August 02.",

The third named storm and second hurricane of the year, Carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off the western coast of Africa on September 2, a type of tropical cyclogenesis typical of Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Moving to the west, the storm gradually intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September 5. Carrie intensified further, before reaching peak intensity on September 8 as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) in the open Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane curved northwards and fluctuated in intensity as it neared Bermuda on September 14. However, Carrie passed well north of the island and turned to the northeast towards Europe. Weakening as it reached higher latitudes, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 23, prior to affecting areas of the British Isles, and subsequently dissipated on September 28.",
