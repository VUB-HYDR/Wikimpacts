    "Main_Event_Assessment_With_Annotation": "Hurricane Charley (1986) was a tropical storm that threatened the East Coast of the United States within a year's timeframe, after Hurricane Gloria of 1985. The third tropical storm and second hurricane of the season, Charley formed as a subtropical low on August\u00a013 along the Florida panhandle. After moving off the coast of South Carolina, the system transitioned into a tropical cyclone and intensified into a tropical storm on August\u00a015. Charley later attained hurricane status before moving across eastern North Carolina. It gradually weakened over the north Atlantic Ocean before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August\u00a020. Charley's remnants remained identifiable for over a week, until after crossing Ireland and Great Britain they dissipated on August\u00a030.",

The area of disturbed weather spread northward, spawning a broad low-pressure area on August\u00a012. Moving northward over the Florida panhandle, the low became slightly better organized as it merged with a weakening weather front on August\u00a013. On August\u00a013, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) identified the system as a developing subtropical low near Apalachee Bay along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. After becoming a subtropical low, the cyclone tracked northeastward through Georgia, before turning eastward and exiting South Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean...

      "Ireland": "First passing just south of Ireland on August\u00a025, the storm dropped heavy rainfall and brought strong winds, significantly affecting the coastline where winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) were reported. Rainfall spread across the entire country, peaking at 11.0\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm) in Kippure mountain. There, a station reported more than 7.8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) in 24\u00a0hours, which set the record for the greatest daily rainfall total in the country. Several 24-hour rainfall records were set during the storm, and new six-hour and twelve-hour record totals at Casement Aerodrome were set with 1.63 and 2.61\u00a0in (41 and 66\u00a0mm), respectively.",
      "United Kingdom": "The storm also affected the United Kingdom as it moved across the southern portion of the country. In Wales, Charley produced record-breaking daily rainfall, which surpassed 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) in Dyfed. Some locations received hundred-year rainfall. The storm struck the area during the Late Summer Bank Holiday, creating unfavorable conditions for driving and resulting in several accidents. Heavy rainfall flooded rivers, which swept away several people. This prompted officials to deploy boats and helicopters to assist in rescues, although at least three deaths were reported due to drowning in the rivers."

It formed on October 31, 1997, in the South China Sea, between Indochina and the Philippines. Strengthening as it moved westward, Linda struck extreme southern Vietnam on November 2 with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), dropping heavy rainfall... The origins of Typhoon Linda were from an area of convection that were first noted east of the Philippines on October 26. A subtropical ridge persisted to the north, which caused the disturbance to move generally westward. On October 29, the system crossed the Philippines and entered the South China Sea. It subsequently began to organize, and late on October 31, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 30W... Shortly after developing, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, and was named 'Linda' by the JTWC. It continued to intensify, reaching winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) as it approached southern Vietnam... At 0900 UTC on November 2, Linda made landfall in the Vietnamese province of C\u00e0 Mau. It maintained its strength over land, and the storm quickly reached typhoon status after entering the Gulf of Thailand... Turning northwestward, Linda deteriorated to tropical storm strength, and struck Thailand late on November 3 with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h)... Linda weakened further over the mountainous terrain of the Malay Peninsula, and the storm emerged into the Andaman Sea with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). This made Linda the first tropical cyclone since Tropical Storm Forrest in 1992 to cross from the western Pacific Ocean into the Indian Ocean... Additionally, upon reaching the Indian Ocean, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the storm as Cyclonic Storm BOB 08, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h)... On November 6, it again attained typhoon status while located off the southwest coast of Burma (Myanmar)... Linda dissipated about 375 miles (604\u00a0km) southwest of Yangon, Burma.",

Dozens of homes were flooded, especially in Manchester where the Merrimack was 10 feet (3\u00a0m) above flood stage. Electricity was cut along several sections of the river, and flooding was reported in Concord, Merrimack, Hooksett, Fremont and Raymond among other communities.

For only the third time in a 150-year history, Lowell dropped its flood-controlling Francis Gate. Also, most notably in downtown Peabody, people could even be seen sailing in boats atop flooded areas.[8] Governor Mitt Romney toured the hard-hit community of Peabody on May 15 and described the situation as historic. 'This is a level of crisis which is beyond anything these communities have ever experienced from water in their history'. On Good Morning America the next day, Romney described the flooding as 'almost Biblical' and said 'We're sort of making jokes about Noah and taking two of each kind of animal because we haven't ever seen rain like this.'[8] Numerous roads, including a busy section of US 1, were closed due to flooding. The Route 495 exit at Route 114 was also closed, the entire area under several feet of water.

Several reasons, including an unusually strong Bermuda high pressure and La Ni\u00f1a in the eastern Pacific Ocean (which causes dry conditions across the southern U.S.) were responsible for the drought. ... 2007 was particularly dry across the region, with rivers and lakes dropping to record-low levels and in some areas. ... The drought was set in motion by the weather phenomenon La Ni\u00f1a which developed during 2005. La Ni\u00f1a caused dry weather across much of the Southeast, ... On top of that, the Bermuda High, also known as the Azores High, a hot and dry air mass over the Atlantic, formed unusually far west, and blocked storms from entering the region, a pattern that wouldn't break until 2008. ... The dryness continued into 2006. However, it was mild in comparison in 2007 and did not cause too many effects. Following that, 2007 was very dry across the Southeastern U.S. receiving record-low rainfall during the year. Mississippi and Georgia each had their driest spring on record, where spring typically is very wet across the region. ... The drought peaked in October, with over 70% of the Southeast in D4 or the worst category of drought, known as exceptional. 2007 would be the second-driest year as a whole over the region. North Carolina had its driest calendar year ever; several towns nearly ran out of water. ... The Bermuda High retreated out into the Atlantic and heavy winter rains during 2007\u201308 helped alleviate drought, a wet 2008 improved drought across most of the region; however, parts of Western North Carolina remained in drought until 2009. ... It is estimated that the drought caused an economic loss over the region at $1.3 billion and water shortages caused the first importing of water in 100 years, and crops failed across the region, causing catastrophic impacts."

Though initially disorganized due to moderate wind shear, a subsequent decrease allowed for shower and thunderstorm activity to develop in earnest by October 14. While moving north-northwestward the following morning, Rafael intensified into a Category 1 hurricane. A cold front off the East Coast of the United States caused the system to turn northward and eventually northeastward by October 16, at which time Rafael attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). As the cyclone entered a more stable atmosphere and tracked across increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures, it began extratropical transition, a process the system completed by the following afternoon. However, Rafael's extratropical remnant persisted for another nine days, with the storm looping around a larger extratropical low over the north-central Atlantic, before turning southeastward and then eastward.

Forming out of an upper-level low pressure system on November 29 near the island of Rarotonga, or roughly 1,470 mi (2,365 km) southeast of Fiji, Trina remained practically stationary as it meandered in the same general area for over a week. Due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, the storm struggled to develop significant convection, preventing it from intensifying beyond 65 km/h (40 mph). After finally succumbing to wind shear on December 2, the system weakened to a tropical depression near Mangaia and dissipated several days later.",

Norman developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000 UTC on October 9, about 765 mi (1231 km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula... Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving north-northwestward, around the western periphery of a weak ridge... The depression developed organized convection near the center, and developed into Tropical Storm Norman about 12 hours after it first formed... Norman attained peak winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) early on October 10... Shortly after peaking in intensity, southwesterly wind shear increased, which led to a decrease in convection coverage... By late on October 10, the center was located about 115 miles (185 km) from the nearest thunderstorms... By then, it had weakened to tropical depression status, and early on October 11 Norman degenerated into a remnant low... The remnants of Norman continued to the east, and later to the east-southeast as it interacted with a tropical disturbance off the coast of Mexico... On October 13, the NHC noted that the remnants of Norman were merging with the disturbance to its east... early on October 15 it reformed into a tropical depression, near the coast of southwestern Mexico...

    "Main_Event_Assessment_With_Annotation": "A tropical storm of unknown origins developed about 480 miles (770\u00a0km) southwest of the southwesternmost islands of Cape Verde at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03. It was first observed by the British steamship Grangense later that day, while located about 1,800 miles (2,900\u00a0km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe. The ship's log described a 'sudden change in the weather', falling barometric pressures, and increasingly rough seas, with the captain noting that he never experienced 'any weather of cyclonic character so far to the eastward before'. The system strengthened and reached winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) early on August\u00a04, becoming a hurricane later that day and reaching Category\u00a04 status around midday on August\u00a07. It passed through the Lesser Antilles and made landfall in Guayama, Puerto Rico late on August\u00a08 with winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h). The storm weakened slightly while moving west-northward across the Caribbean Sea and made landfall in Guayama, Puerto Rico late on August\u00a08 with winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h). Several hours later, it emerged into the southwestern Atlantic as a Category\u00a03 hurricane. The system paralleled the north coast of Dominican Republic and then crossed the Bahamas, striking several islands. It then moved north while still being located east of Florida, recurved northeastward early the next morning, and appeared to be moving out to sea. However, by August\u00a017, it turned back to the northwest and made landfall near Hatteras, North Carolina early on the following day. The storm weakened after moving inland and fell to Category\u00a01 intensity by 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018. It re-emerged into the Atlantic and continued weakening, but maintained Category\u00a01 intensity. By late on August\u00a020, the storm curved eastward over the northwestern Atlantic and began losing tropical characteristics, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022. However, after four days, the system regenerated into a tropical storm while located about 695\u00a0miles (1,120\u00a0km) west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on August\u00a026. It moved slowly north-northwestward, until curving to the east on August\u00a029. Between August\u00a026 and September\u00a01, the storm did not differentiate in intensity, but began re-strengthening while turning southeastward on September\u00a02. Early on the following day, the storm again reached hurricane intensity. It curved northeastward and passed through the Azores on September\u00a03, shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.",

It became the first storm to make a major landfall in Nampula Province in Mozambique since Cyclone Jokwe in 2008. The eighth tropical storm, fourth tropical cyclone and fourth intense tropical cyclone of the 2021\u201322 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gombe originated from a tropical disturbance located off the coast of Madagascar. This area of convection was designated by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center as Invest 97S on 6 March. The next day, it began to slowly move westward and executed a loop as it became more organized, which prompted M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France Reunion (MFR) to note the system as Zone of Disturbed Weather 09. The system became a depression on 9 March, and became a moderate tropical storm the same day. Soon after being named, Gombe made landfall in Madagascar, and entered in the Mozambique Channel the next day. The storm continued its westward motion while slowly intensifying, and was upgraded to a Tropical Cyclone by the MFR on 10 March. Closing in on Nampula Province, the storm underwent rapid intensification, and was upgraded to the fourth Intense Tropical Cyclone of the year and reached its peak intensity on 11 march, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 960 hectopascals (28\u00a0inHg). The storm proceeded to make landfall, and quickly lost its convection over land. On 12 March, Gombe degenerated into a remnant low overland. However, the system subsequently turned southeastward and reemerged over water, before briefly regenerating into a tropical depression on 17 March. Gombe dissipated later that day.",

    "Main_Event_Assessment_With_Annotation": "A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August 4. On August 9, a ship reported rough seas and winds of force 10 on the Beaufort scale. On that basis, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Betsy developed that day about 835 mi (1344 km) east of Barbados. The next day, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed winds of 120 mph (190 km/h), which indicated that Betsy had intensified significantly overnight. After maintaining that intensity for about 24 hours, Betsy began weakening, moving directly over Marie-Galante and southern Guadeloupe. It entered the eastern Caribbean with winds of 90 mph (140 km/h) before it began a track to the west-northwest. On August 12, Hurricane Betsy passed about 30 mi (48 km) south of Saint Croix before striking southeastern Puerto Rico. This made Betsy the first hurricane to strike the island since the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane. It crossed the central portion of the island, and the structure deteriorated and the eye became difficult to locate as Betsy crossed the highest mountains. The eye became well-defined as it approached the coast, and Betsy emerged on the northwest coast near Camuy at a similar intensity as when it moved ashore. The hurricane re-intensified as it moved toward the Bahamas, reaching winds of 110 mph (180 km/h) on August 13. That day, the eye passed near Grand Turk Island and San Salvador Island. By that time, the storm had increased in size; the Hurricane Hunters reported that the gale-force winds extended 125 mi (201 km) to its north. The eye reformed on August 14, becoming well-organized and attaining a minimum barometric pressure of 960 mbar (28 inHg). The next day, Betsy turned to the northeast due to an approaching trough. Despite beginning a weakening trend, the pressure dropped further to 954 mbar (28.2 inHg) on August 17. The eye became increasingly poorly defined, and Betsy weakened to a tropical storm on August 18 to the south of Nova Scotia. Turning to the east, it became extratropical later that day, eventually dissipating on August 20.",

The ninth depression, and the third and strongest named storm of the 2017 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Ockhi originated from an area of low pressure that formed over the southwest Bay of Bengal on November 28. The storm organized into a Depression off southeast coast of Sri Lanka on November 29, causing damage to property and life in Sri Lanka while passing by. Due to high atmospheric moisture and warmer oceanic surface temperature between Sri Lanka and Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) in mainland India, Ockhi intensified into a cyclonic storm on November 30.",

The storm reached peak intensity on September\u00a024, with maximum sustained winds estimated over 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). The name Hikaa was named by Maldives, which refers to the 'scorpion' in Maldivian. An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted along the west coast of India on September\u00a019... A distinct low-pressure area developed a day later off the coast of Maharashtra... By September\u00a021, a circulation was consolidating within the system, located east of the heaviest convection. The system moved slowly westward across the Arabian Sea, steered by a ridge to north. Warm water temperatures favored further development, despite moderate wind shear... Early on September\u00a022, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression, and soon upgraded it to a deep depression... Late on September\u00a022, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system, designating it Tropical Cyclone 03A... Due to decreasing wind shear and warm, moist air, the system quickly intensified on September\u00a023... The IMD upgraded the system to Cyclonic Storm Hikaa; later that day the agency upgraded the storm further to a severe cyclonic storm... Considering the storm a 'midget tropical cyclone', the JTWC upgraded Hikaa to the equivalent of hurricane status late on September\u00a023... The IMD upgraded Hikaa to a very severe cyclonic storm on September\u00a024, estimating peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph)... Around 14:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, Hikaa made landfall in eastern Oman just north of Duqm, becoming the first very severe cyclonic storm on record to strike the country in September.",

Subsequent to the confirmation of the existence of Hurricane Alice, the U.S. Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico warned the islands of the northern Lesser Antilles to prepare for strong winds and rough seas. Hurricane Alice produced moderate to strong winds across the islands, peaking at 81\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) in Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) in Saba. The hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across several islands, including a peak of 11.27 inches (286\u00a0mm) in 48\u00a0hours recorded at Saba. Due to its small size, only a few islands received significant effects from the hurricane. Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, Saba, Anguilla, Sint Eustatius, and Saint Kitts reported damage from the hurricane, totaling $623,500 (1955\u00a0USD, $4.7\u00a0million 2006\u00a0USD). Damage was heaviest on Saba and Anguilla, occurring primarily to shipping facilities and crops."

On August\u00a012, upper-level outflow improved in all four quadrants, which resulted in the JTWC issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA).

It is the first known Australian cyclone to make four distinct landfalls in the country. The system rapidly intensified to become Tropical Cyclone Steve at around 7\u00a0am Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) (UTC+10) on 27 February 2000 and crossed the Queensland coast as a Category\u00a02 system on 27 February to the north of Cairns at around 7\u00a0pm AEST. The cyclone passed over Mornington Island in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria and crossed the Northern Territory coast north of Port McArthur on 1 March as a Category\u00a01. The cyclone weakened back to a tropical low again, but maintained a strong low to middle-level circulation as it crossed the base of the Top End of the Northern Territory. The low moved just south of the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf into the Kimberley region of Western Australia and reformed once again into a tropical cyclone just west of Broome on 5 March at 1\u00a0pm Australian Western Standard Time (AWST) (UTC+8). Cyclone Steve moved in a west southwest direction parallel to the Pilbara coast and strengthened further during the day and was upgraded to a Category\u00a02 system early on 6 March. The cyclone deepened to a pressure of 975\u00a0hPa during the day. Continuing on its path to the southwest, Steve passed north of Port Hedland and Karratha on 6 March, before crossing the Pilbara coast near Mardie around midnight on 6 March (Steve's third landfall). The system was again downgraded to Category\u00a01 as it moved inland. At around midnight on 7 March, Steve again moved offshore about 175 kilometres (109\u00a0mi) north of Carnarvon and moved southwards along the coast. However, the system did not intensify further beyond Category\u00a01 and made its final (fourth) landfall at around midnight on 9 March east of Denham. Steve then continued to track to the south-east and increased in speed across southern parts of Western Australia during the 10 and 11 March and becoming extra-tropical, before moving offshore for the final time to the east of Esperance late on 11 March and over the waters of the Great Australian Bight.",

Widespread flooding resulted in the Katherine, Daly and Victoria River regions. Water levels in the Katherine River came to within about 3 metres (9.8 feet) of those experienced in the 1998 floods but subsided without inundating the town. Rainfall across the Top End, Victoria River region over a four-day period between 29 February to 4 March was between 200 and 400 millimetres (7.9 and 15.7 inches). Similar totals were recorded over four days in the Kimberley region. Numerous Northern Territory roads and highways were cut with many communities isolated."

The very heavy rainfall associated with Steve produced widespread flooding in northern parts of the state, including the Gascoyne region. Communities in the Kimberley region which remained isolated for more than two weeks required food and supply air-drops. Low-lying areas of the Carnarvon townsite were flooded when the Gascoyne River breached its banks. The Gascoyne River at Carnarvon reached its highest level since 1960. Parts of the western Pilbara and northern Gascoyne received totals that ranged from 200 to 300 mm. Several sites reported highest on record daily rainfall amounts including Mandora (281.0 mm on 6th) and Mount Narryer (152.0 mm on 10th). Carnarvon (100.6 mm on 9th) reported its highest March daily rainfall since records commenced at the airport in 1945. Rainfall ranging from 50 to 100 mm continued over inland parts extending in a south-easterly direction from the west Gascoyne to the south coast near Esperance. Flooding occurred in the Esperance area and number of roads and bridges were washed away. Salmon Gums Research Station recorded 91 mm of rain on 11 March."

However, after the storm, only eight returned to the prison, leaving 27\u00a0others missing.[11] After the storm, the American Red Cross brought supplies to areas affected by the hurricane, requesting as much as $10,000 in relief work.[12] Several other local relief committees also brought supplies to affected areas.[13] An estimated $2\u00a0million in damages from the storm were attributed to crop damage alone, especially rice and cotton.[12] The storm was estimated to have killed 40\u00a0people and caused $7.5\u00a0million in damage.[6]"
