The drought began as early as September 2010 in some regions, though widespread lack of rain and snow began in October. The lack of precipitation caused lower than normal snow cover, putting wheat crops at risk of being killed by frost as well as reducing the amount of moisture in the ground. The provinces of Anhui, Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Shanxi were impacted by the drought. As well as destroying wheat crops, the drought caused water shortages for an estimated 2.31 million people and 2.57 million livestock. Within the eight provinces, 20% of the farmland and 35% of the entire wheat crop was impacted. By February 2011, the drought hit a total of up to 7,730,000 hectares (19,100,000 acres) of winter wheat that had already been planted.

The storm emerged into the western Caribbean Sea on June 15, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Agnes the next day. Agnes intensified into a hurricane on June 18 while in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane eventually made landfall near Panama City, Florida, late on June 19. After moving inland, Agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered Georgia. The weakening trend halted as the storm crossed over Georgia and into South Carolina. While over eastern North Carolina, Agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm on June 21, as a result of baroclinic activity. Early the following day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near New York City as a strong tropical storm. Agnes quickly became an extratropical cyclone on June 23.",

It was the twelfth tropical cyclone and eighth tropical storm of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, forming on September 15 east of the Windward Islands... The storm was small with an asymmetric wind field, and wind shear displaced the circulation from the deep convection... Upon becoming a tropical storm, Helene gradually turned to the north while rounding an anticyclone to its east... It reached its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) late on September 21... The storm began weakening on September 22 as it approached the northern Gulf Coast... By 0900\u00a0UTC that day, strong wind shear moved the convection away from the center and toward the north and northeast. This prompted NHC forecaster Lixion Avila to remark, 'If I did not have a reconnaissance plane in the area, I would not know there was a tropical cyclone by just observing IR satellite imagery.'... The storm made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida at 1200\u00a0UTC on September 22 after weakening from its peak intensity to winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h)... Despite strong wind shear, convection increased over Helene's center as the storm moved through North Carolina... Satellite imagery and buoy data indicated that Helene re-intensified into a tropical storm inland over North Carolina... The storm became compact over the northern Atlantic Ocean, with a diameter of 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km)... Strong convection developed over the center on September 24, and the following day Helene re-attained its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) while southeast of Nova Scotia... The wind estimate was based on observations from the Neptune Olivine, a nearby ship that recorded 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) winds and a barometric pressure of 988\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg); because the ship was located to the south of the center, the storm's minimum pressure was estimated at 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg)...

Several homes and nearby roads were flooded near the river. About 100\u00a0homes were flooded in Leon County, and 70\u00a0streets were flooded in Tallahassee. Portions of U.S. Highway 98 were flooded in Port St. Joe and near Carrabelle. About 70\u00a0people had to evacuate their homes due to the flooding. Sustained winds across the state peaked at 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h), though gusts reached 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) at Cape San Blas. The winds combined with the heavy rainfall caused trees to fall onto power lines, leaving about 5,000\u00a0people without electricity. The storm spawned 6\u00a0tornadoes along the panhandle, one of which destroyed several mobile homes in Wakulla. As the storm moved ashore, tides were less than 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above normal, but were high enough to cause minor beach erosion. In Leon County, the storm destroyed two homes and six mobile homes, and damaged more than 120\u00a0homes in Wakulla County."

It originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on June 27 and became organized as a tropical depression on June 30, strengthening to a tropical storm soon thereafter. Elsa then became a hurricane around 12:00 UTC on July 2, as its center moved just south of Barbados, and reached its peak intensity six hours later with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 991 mbar (29.3 inHg). The storm then weakened back into a tropical storm and made landfall in Cuba on July 5, before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico early on the next day. Elsa paralleled the west coast of Florida and made landfall again in Taylor County, Florida, on July 7, with maximum winds of about 65 mph (100 km/h). The storm then accelerated northeastward across the southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, restrengthening slightly due to its proximity to the Atlantic. Elsa emerged back over water off New Jersey early on July 9 and moved over eastern Long Island and western Rhode Island, before becoming extratropical at 18:00 UTC that day, while moving through New England.",

The China Meteorological Agency started to monitor an area of scattered convection and circulation in weather maps which was located in a near-equatorial trough, located to the east of Guam...

At that time, the disturbance is highly disorganized, with its convection steered to the northeast... It started to move to the west while slowly consolidating before curving to the northeast... Between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC of that day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Olive... The system had a good outflow, as being evidenced by radar imagery... Olive then slightly moved to the west-northwest before taking a north-northwestward track... The system then accelerated to the northwest before intensifying further to a Category 2 typhoon... It then started to slow down and impact the northern part of the Ryukyu Islands... with Olive passing near Yakushima Island before midnight at its peak... With the influence of a long-wave trough near the coast of East China, the system took a northward motion before making landfall on the main Japanese island of Kyushu... It rapidly unraveled to a tropical storm as it passed through Saga Prefecture before moving through the Sea of Japan...

The storm attained its peak intensity on September 24, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 998 mbar (998 hPa; 29.5 inHg). Matthew made landfall near Monkey River Town with winds of 40 mph (64 km/h). After moving inland, Matthew quickly weakened, and was a strong tropical depression only three hours later. From thereon, Matthew underwent further gradual weakening while simultaneously losing forward speed as it moved over southern Mexico. In the morning of September 26, it finally justified its forecast faith by weakening to a remnant low; however, it continued to produce heavy rainfalls over parts of eastern Mexico and other parts of Central America. Matthew's remnants dissipated completely over Mexico.",

In July 2019, climatologist David Jones from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology stated that the present drought was now officially the worst on record in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin... Drier and warmer and drier than average conditions were expected to persist at least until the end of the year with no relief in sight for most of the drought affected areas... The drought was continuing in December 2019... In March 2021, above average rainfall led to serious and destructive flooding in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment and on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales.",

      "Australia": "According to the Bureau of Meteorology, much of eastern Australia experienced a dry 2001. 2002 was one of Australia's driest and warmest years on record, with 'remarkably widespread' dry conditions, particularly in the eastern half of the country, which was again affected by El Ni\u00f1o conditions. It was, at the time, Australia's fourth driest year since 1900. 2008 and 2009 saw continuing hot and dry conditions in south-eastern Australia, with occasional heavy rainfall failing to break the continuing drought. The effects of the drought were exacerbated by Australia's (then) second hottest year on record in 2009, with record-breaking heatwaves in January, February and the second half of the year. 2017 was a drier than average year for much of inland Queensland, most of New South Wales, eastern and central Victoria, and all of Tasmania. In 2018, rainfall for the year was very low over the southeastern quarter of the Australian mainland, with much of the region experiencing totals in the lowest 10% of historical observations, and was particularly low over the mainland southeast from April onwards. The state of New South Wales was declared to be 100% in drought by August 2018, remaining at 98.6% into May 2019; by May 2019 65.2% of Queensland was also declared to be in drought. Two southern parts of Western Australia were declared 'water deficient' by May 2019 after months of drought, with other drought affected areas including central and east Gippsland in Victoria, and parts of eastern South Australia. On one-to-two-year timeframes to the end of March 2019, rainfall deficiencies in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin, Australia's most extensive river system, were the third lowest on record, behind similar length timeframes between 1901 and 1903, and between 1918 and 1920. In July 2019, climatologist David Jones from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology stated that the present drought was now officially the worst on record in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin, and 'had now exceeded the Federation Drought, the WWII drought and the Millennium drought in terms of its severity through the MDB'. In October 2019, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology stated that drier and warmer and drier than average conditions were expected to persist at least until the end of the year with no relief in sight for most of the drought affected areas, influenced at least in part by a positive Indian Ocean Dipole and a prolonged period of negative SAM (Southern Annular Mode) during October and November. Exacerbating the effects of diminished rainfall in this drought has been a record breaking run of above average monthly temperatures, lasting 36 months to October 2019. As of December 2019 the drought was continuing \u2013 including the driest November across Australia on record \u2013 but the Bureau of Meteorology reported that the positive Indian Ocean Dipole had weakened to around 50% of its peak seen in mid October, possibly indicating a future improvement in conditions later in the Australian summer."

The eighth tropical disturbance of the season, Ernest formed from a persistent area of thunderstorms in the central Indian Ocean. It initially moved southwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Ernest on January\u00a020 while moving into the Mozambique Channel. After hitting Mayotte, the storm quickly intensified to reach peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph 10\u00a0minute winds) off the western coast of Madagascar. Ernest weakened slightly before striking the southwest portion of that country on January\u00a023, producing widespread flooding and gusty winds. The next day the cyclone became extratropical before dissipating on January\u00a025.",
