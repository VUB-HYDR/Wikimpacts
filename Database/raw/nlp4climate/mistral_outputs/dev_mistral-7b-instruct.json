By the next day, at around 06:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression. Six hours later, the JMA began issuing advisories, noting that the system was producing 10-minute sustained winds of at least 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph). The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 02:30 UTC on July 15 after satellite imagery depicted deep convection wrapping into its developing low-level circulation center. With the system continuing to develop, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Talas. As convective banding improved, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance to a tropical storm after recording Dvorak estimates of T2.5, indicating 1-minute sustained winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). On July 16, Talas gradually intensified as it became better organized in response to being located in a favorable environment, consisting of low to moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear as well as good outflow to the south. At 09:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Talas into a severe tropical storm after the storm attained 10-minute sustained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 985\u00a0hPa (29.1\u00a0inHg); this constituted its peak intensity.

The system degraded to tropical storm strength for a final time on September 16 as it began accelerating northeast.

The storm dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding in both Mozambique and Malawi, destroying thousands of houses and leaving thousands homeless. Delfina weakened while moving inland and was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January 1, 2003. However, its remnants moved across the country and into Malawi, later looping around and crossing back over Mozambique. The remnants of Delfina were last observed on January 9.",

It became China's worst winter weather in half a century. According to some media sources, the storms were directly responsible for at least 129 deaths. (...) Snow was even reported in the country's largest true desert, the Taklamakan, where the snow and record low temperatures near \u221225 \u00b0C (\u221213 \u00b0F) lasted 11 consecutive days and killed livestock. At one point, the temperature dropped to \u221232 \u00b0C (\u221226 \u00b0F), breaking the January 2006 record of \u221226.1 \u00b0C (\u221215.0 \u00b0F). (...) The snowstorm caused extensive damage to many low-rise buildings, the roofs of which collapsed, killing occupants inside. It was estimated that about 223,000 homes were destroyed and 862,000 others were damaged. (...) The power system of China was also severely affected by adverse conditions. Widespread power outages were reported. In Chenzhou, which has a population of 4.6 million, it was reported that the entire city had no power or water for nearly two weeks, including government buildings and hospitals, while telecommunications cables and Internet networks were also damaged. (...) The snowstorm also damaged water supply equipment. For instance, in Wuhan, up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households.

The position of the jet stream, very different to last year when the UK had cold polar air, is the main factor bringing the repeated storms to Europe\u2019s shores, as is the prevalence of winter storms in the U.S., remnants of which are fed into the jet stream and propelled east. Record high tides and tidal surges coinciding with Spring tides have exacerbated the situation and caused coastal damage and flooding. (...) Despite the weather in the last three months of the year, 2013 has still been one of the most benign weather years in terms of insured losses. For many insurers who announce their year-end results next week, we expect results for those writing personal and commercial property lines to have positive results. Those insurers that have done most to understand the potential for flood, storm and weather events will have benefitted from this investment given the events of the last two to three months.",
