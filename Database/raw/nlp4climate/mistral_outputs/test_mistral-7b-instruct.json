There, a station reported more than 7.8 in (200 mm) in 24 hours, which set the record for the greatest daily rainfall total in the country. Several 24-hour rainfall records were set during the storm, and new six-hour and twelve-hour record totals at Casement Aerodrome were set with 1.63 and 2.61 in (41 and 66 mm), respectively. The rainfall left some areas flooded, particularly in the Dublin area where 451 buildings were inundated, some up to a depth of 8 ft (2.4 m). Preliminarily, it was described as the worst flooding in the history of Dublin. Two small rivers, the Dodder and the Dargle, overflowed their banks due to the rainfall. The River Dargle overflowed in Bray, flooding some areas up to a depth of 5 ft (1.5 m) and forcing about 1,000 people to evacuate; several special-needs people were evacuated by boat. The flood, which originated about one mile north of the town, damaged over 500 houses and brought down several trees. Despite local politicians promising for flood protection after the flood, the town remained vulnerable to such flooding at least 20 years after the storm."

We are also continuously coordinating with the local government units to rescue the affected residents in Calumpit and Hagonoy.' The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council director Benito Ramos said 'thousands of rescue workers were deployed across Luzon and the island's sparsely populated northeast coast was evacuated following the orders from the president Benigno Aquino III.' Nalgae was making a similar path across the saturated Luzon Island as Typhoon Nesat. The wind gusts brought by Nalgae toppled trees and blew away tin roofs of some houses in Isabela's provincial capital of Ilagan. Nalgae continued to worsen the flooding and destruction brought by Nesat. Nalgae was far more stronger than Nesat and plummeted the nation with more winds and rains.' It was later reported that 'at least 8 million people living in the Philippines have experience faced much worse floods than the earlier destruction caused by typhoon Nesat.' The disaster management chief Benito Ramos said 'The fight is not over yet. I hope the (Nesat) floods will wash out to Manila Bay before the (Nalgae) runoff hits the area. If the latter catches up to the former, there won\u2019t be any rooftops left to see above the floodwaters.' The local weather agency announced that the water levels on the tributaries of major central Luzon rivers were still continuing to rise fast and posed a threat to the nearby towns and villages.'

Despite the lack of impact, the storm's remnants were caught in an upper-level jet stream, and steered towards Europe. There, they contributed to heavy rainfall across portions of Britain on October 5, causing localized accumulation of flood waters.

A gust of 230 km/h (143 mph) was reported in Su'ao. These winds caused Taipei 101's tuned mass damper to sway a record 100 cm (39 in). Taiping Mountain in eastern Taiwan's Yilan County saw the heaviest rains from the typhoon, with accumulations peaking at 1,334 mm (52.52 in). At the height of the storm, 4.85 million households lost electricity. This was the largest blackout on record in Taiwan due to a typhoon, surpassing the previous record of 2.79 million after Typhoon Herb in 1996. Water supply to 429,248 homes and land line telephone service to 64,992 homes was cut during the storm. A contaminated Nanshi River suffered a drastic overflow, and soon mixed with the primary water source of the Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area. The river's turbidity reached record levels in just two hours, catching Taipei's Water Department off-guard. The excess water overwhelmed the regional purification system. As a result, the water supply to approximately 5 million households in Taipei was polluted for the next few days. Agricultural damage in Taiwan exceeded NT$3.03 billion (US$94.8 million). The banana crop suffered the greatest impact, with 5,436 hectares (13,430 acres) damaged; losses from the crop reached NT$460.15 million (US$14.3 million). Six windmills of Taipower were destroyed."

A total of 6,748 hectares (16,670 acres) of crops sustained damage. In Miyako-jima, crops sustained significant damage from salt; relatively little rain coupled with strong winds allowed sea spray to travel farther inland than normal. Preliminary estimates placed losses at \u00a594.52 million (US$761,000).

Cuban authorities declared that Gustav is the worst hurricane to hit the country in 50 years. Authorities called the storm damage the worst since 1956. The 211 mph (340 km/h) wind gusts registered in the city of Paso Real de San Diego were the highest in Cuba's history, according to the provincial newspaper, the Guerrillero. Winds were so strong that the weather station instruments broke.

Damage included numerous trees down in various locations, such as around some Marriott hotels, and large tree limbs were broken from oak trees along St. Charles Avenue. Millions of smaller branches were scattered throughout neighborhoods, blown by the strong winds. Area hotels planned to reopen the week of September 8, some by Saturday, September 6. The Associated Press reported on the floodwall along the Industrial Canal, which connects Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River, and is susceptible to surges via the Gulf Outlet. High water splashed over the floodwalls onto new splash guards, but the walls were not breached. Minor street flooding began in the upper Ninth Ward of New Orleans. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, it was considered to be the worst storm to hit the area since Hurricane Betsy in 1965.

This also caused the storm to inherit cooler, drier air, which prompted weakening while also recurving towards the northeast.\nAt 00:00 UTC on October 29, the JTWC downgraded Warren into a tropical storm, though the JMA would not follow suit until 36 hours later.\nDespite this, the storm's center remained well-defined for an additional 24 hours.\nThe remnants of the storm later crossed the coast of Vietnam, with winds of 55 to 65 km/h (35 to 40 mph).\nLate on November 1, the circulation had become less defined and increasingly difficult to locate, and the JTWC estimated that Warren dissipated the next day.",

Fiona then strengthened into the first major hurricane of the season and reached peak 1-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 931\u00a0mbar (27.49\u00a0inHg). After passing Bermuda and weakening to Category\u00a03 intensity, Fiona quickly transitioned into a large and powerful extratropical cyclone and struck Nova Scotia with sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) early on September 24.",

In Yamaguchi Prefecture on western Honshu, Nabi damaged a portion of the historical Kintai Bridge, originally built in 1674. In Yamagata Prefecture, the winds damaged a window in a school, injuring several boys from the debris. One person was seriously injured in Kitakata, Fukushima after strong winds blew a worker from scaffolding of a building under construction. Effects from Nabi spread as far north as Hokkaido, where heavy rainfall damaged roads and caused hundreds of schools to close. In Ashoro, an overflown river flooded a hotel, and a minor power outage occurred in Teshikaga. Ahead of the storm, high waves and gusty winds led to one drowning when a woman was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu, Kagawa. A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes, killing three people. A man who was listed as missing was found dead in a flooded rice field. In Tarumi, a landslide buried a home in mud, killing two people.

A 15 m (50 ft) tidal wave swamped the towns of Garchitorena, Serona, Lagonoy and Caramoan in the Camarines Sur province, resulting in the deaths of 137 people. Virtually every house was demolished due to storm surge in Benagaspasan, a small town with a population 1,000, where 47 people were killed. Across much of Luzon, Irma flattened houses and flooding streets, resulting in considerable damage. Irma brought down power lines, which led to blackouts along the suburbs of Manila. Many other deaths occurred when they were crushed to death under collapsed houses or killed by flying debris. For instance, two people died when their house on Mindoro Island collapsed and a farmer in Quezon died after being hit by a falling coconut. Elsewhere on Midoro Island, 60 homes were destroyed. Offshore, eighteen fisherman were listed as missing. Twenty-six of the casualties happened in Manila while 12 others died in the rural town of Daet along the southern part of Luzon due to flooding and falling debris. Due to the storm, iron sheets were littered across the slums of Manila. Communication lines between Daet and Manila were disconnected; many villages between the two locations were destroyed. In Lucena, two people were killed and many coconuts were tossed from trees. In Bulacan, civil defense officials advised thousands of inhabitants on the banks of the Angat River to flee as water along the river threatened to overflow their banks. In the Rizal province, one agency reported that it dispatched several army trucks to fetch roughly 2,000 stranded 12- to 15-year-old boy scouts. In a nearby park, the typhoon blew down houses, power poles, billboards and trees. Even though the Clark Air Base and Subic Bay, both United States-run, sustained little damage, six C-130 transports had to be evacuated to the Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and ships, including the aircraft carrier Constellation."

Water levels in the Katherine River came to within about 3 metres (9.8 feet) of those experienced in the 1998 floods but subsided without inundating the town. Rainfall across the Top End, Victoria River region over a four-day period between 29 February to 4 March was between 200 and 400 millimetres (7.9 and 15.7 inches).

It was the eleventh tropical storm and fourth typhoon of the very inactive season. The storm formed on September\u00a014 east of the Philippines and moved slowly for several days, initially to the northwest, then curving to the northeast before turning westward due to a ridge to the north. During this time, Fanapi intensified to reach 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph). Fanapi made its first landfall on September\u00a019 over Hualien, Taiwan, becoming the first typhoon to hit the island since Typhoon Morakot in August 2009. Later that day made a final landfall in Fujian, China. The storm dissipated on September\u00a021 over southern China.",

Late on September 14, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression to the east of the Philippine island of Luzon. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 12W.",
      "Landfall_in_Taiwan": "Early on September 19, Typhoon Fanapi made landfall over eastern Taiwan near Hualien City with winds of 162 km/h (101 mph), according to Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. The storm subsequently weakened over land, dipping southwestward as convection diminished over the northern portion of the storm. However, the storm resumed its westward trajectory and soon moved over the Taiwan Strait as a severe tropical storm.",
      "Landfall_in_China": "Fanapi made a second landfall on southeastern China near Fujian and weakened further over land, although thunderstorms persisted southeast of the circulation along the coast. Fanapi weakened into a tropical depression later that day and dissipated late on September 21."

The storm produced 5.09 inches (129 mm) of rain in Wilmington, Delaware and a storm tide of 3.2 feet (0.98 m) above normal in Lewes. In Pennsylvania, the passage of Tropical Storm Doria resulted in 6.57 inches (167 mm) of rain and peak wind gusts of 73 mph (117 km/h) in Philadelphia. Moderate winds downed trees and power lines in Pennsylvania, and one person died in the state. Several rivers in the southeastern portion of the state experienced record-breaking flooding. In New Jersey, Doria produced wind gusts of up to 54 mph (87 km/h) and storm tides 5.3 feet (1.6 m) above normal in Atlantic City. The outer bands of the storm spawned an F2 tornado near Cape May. It moved quickly northward through Cape May County, and caused about $250,000 in damage (1971 USD) in damage along its 29-mile (47 km) path. The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 10.29 inches (261 mm) in Little Falls. Record 24-hour rainfall totals occurred in Newark with 7.84 inches (199 mm) and Trenton with 7.55 inches (192 mm). The rainfall led to record flooding on several small streams in the state. The Beden Brook crested at over 5 feet (1.5 m) above normal, which destroyed a bridge near Princeton. The Raritan River at Manville crested at 9.8 feet (3.0 m), a record that stood until the passage of Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The heavy rainfall overtopped the levee system in Zarephath, causing severe damage to the Alma White College and preventing it from opening in the fall of 1971. The rainfall also flooded two fire houses in Somerville with several feet of water, and the water treatment plant in Bridgewater Township with 18 inches (460 mm) of floodwaters in what was catalogued as a 50-year flood event. Following the flooding to the water treatment plant, officials raised the beams of the plant to withstand a 500-year flood event. Eleven houses experienced flooding damage in Montgomery Township. Doria killed three people and caused $138 million in damage (1971 USD) in the state.",
