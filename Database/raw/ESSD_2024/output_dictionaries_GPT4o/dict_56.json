According to Primary Industries Minister, Ed Casey, \"the drought affected region stretched in a 200 km to 300 km wide strip from Stanthorpe to Charters Towers\".[23] So few wheat and barley crops survived, about half the usual for that year, that grains had to be imported from other states.[24] In June 1994, more than ten towns had lost irrigation systems; and some areas had gone five years without decent rainfall.[23] A part of the upper Darling River system collapsed during this drought. By October 1994, the Condamine River was exhausted, reverting to a series of ponds. Across the state, in more than 13,000 properties, totaling 40% of Queensland, was drought declared.[25] The flow past Goondiwindi was the lowest since 1940. Cotton farms near Moree and Narrabri had been allocated no water for irrigation, which resulted in a major loss of production.[25] The town of Warwick was particularly affected.",
