        "Wind": "The system had a good outflow, as being evidenced by radar imagery.[2] Olive then slightly moved to the west-northwest before taking a north-northwestward track due to the weakness of another subtropical ridge, which was located near the Philippines.[2] The system also slowed down, before intensifying to a severe tropical storm at 18:00 UTC on the next day as the forward motion of the storm speeded.[1] Another ridge pulled the system to the northwest before again, slowing down as Olive became poorly defined on satellite images.[1][2] On 12:00 UTC on August 1, the CMA upgraded the system to a minimal typhoon based on an estimate of 68 knots and an emerging eye; however, the JTWC only elevated the system's intensity to typhoon status at the same time on the next day.[1][2] The system then accelerated to the northwest before intensifying further to a Category 2 typhoon at 12:00 UTC on August 3 and reached its peak intensity shortly, with maximum sustained winds of 155 km/h (95 mph) and an unusually low minimum barometric pressure of 935 mbar, as being recorded by a reconnaissance aircraft.[2]",
        "Rainfall": "A conducted research about Olive reported that the rain more dominated than the winds, classifying the system as a rain typhoon.[6] Heavy inundation damages were also seen throughout the southern part of Japan.[1] The Yakushima Station in Yakushima Island reported winds up to 80 knots and a minimum pressure of 938.7 mb, while no reports of damages were seen.[2] In Kasedashi City, Kagoshima, torrential downpours broke the embankment of the Kaseda River, flooding houses and establishments near the area.[7] The Kuma River in Kumamoto Prefecture also overflowed, destroying 209 houses and flooding 2,647 more.[8] The dam in the prefecture, namely Ichifusa Dam, also released large amounts of water to avoid failure, flooding its lake and destroying some houses nearby.[2] A rainfall amount of 59.8 inches in Ebino, Miyazaki Prefecture were recorded causing widespread landslides, which killed 69 individuals.[2][9][10]",
