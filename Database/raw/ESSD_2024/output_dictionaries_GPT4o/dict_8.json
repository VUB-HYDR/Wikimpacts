            "Death_with_annotation": "The fire in the settlement forced the closure of a section of British Columbia Highway 1, part of Trans-Canada Highway, as well as Highway 12, which ends in Lytton. Despite deployment of more than 17,000 firefighters by mid-July, the size and number of the fires grew. Almost 1,000,000 acres (4,050 km2) of forest were consumed by large wildfires, and more than 2,250,000 acres (9,110 km2) were burnt in the United States as of July 15. The intensity of the fires moved the US fire preparedness alert level to 5 (highest) by July 14, which was an early start of the wildfire season. In addition to that, the Governors of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho declared states of emergency due to the extreme risk of wildfires. The Canadian army officials set up a coordination center in Edmonton in order to assist wildfire actions in British Columbia, which would be directed until July 19. As the extreme heat and dry conditions persisted, scientists, firefighters and various politicians urged residents not to use fireworks during Independence Day celebrations in the Western United States and on Canada Day in Alberta. In addition to that, Washington and British Columbia enacted state-/provincewide bans on most open fires. Other areas such as Idaho and Manitoba used more localized approaches to burn restrictions. As of September 14, 2021, the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) reported that 44,647 wildfires in the United States had burned 5.6 million acres of land. Similarly, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) announced that 6,317 wildfires burned 10.34 million acres. Due to the earliness and severity of the wildfire season, the United States and Canada were unable to provide each other with aid to jointly combat fires. Initially, the NIFC declared that the United States and Canada had a preparedness level of 5, meaning it had the potential to exhaust firefighting resources. However, by September 20, 2021, the national preparedness level was reduced to 4 and 1 for the United States and Canada, respectively. Prior to the start of the extreme heat wave, wildfire risk was greatly elevated by existing weather conditions. In April 2021, the North American wildfire season was predicted to be severe due to record drought conditions and high spring temperatures in the West. In May, more than 75% of the western United States experienced drought conditions, with 21% of these conditions being deemed as 'exceptional drought', which is the most extreme level of drought. These extreme conditions result in a lack of moisture on the ground that is imperative for combating wildfires. In Arizona, there were 311 early wildfires in the first four months of the year, compared to 127 in the same period in 2020. In July 2021, haze from West Coast fires resulted in air quality alerts in East Coast cities. In Montana, evacuation orders had displaced around 600 people by early August. On October 21, the national preparedness level was lowered to 1, while by November 5, a total of 48,725 wildfires had burned more than 6.5 million acres across the United States, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). Glacier melt[edit]: Extreme temperatures were also noted for mountain regions, which accelerated the melting of glaciers. Extensive melting occurred in the snowcaps of Banff National Park, which a glaciologist estimated that the Albertan snow from the mountains melted three times faster than usual. On Mount Rainier, the heat wave caused the mass of the snow cap to shrink by 30%, and Washington's glaciers in general have come through what glaciologists say to be the strongest melting episode in 100 years. Additionally, the increased melting of glaciers caused high amounts of runoff to be present within some rivers. The unexpected snowmelt resulted in extensive flash flooding down the creeks and rivers fed by the glaciers, triggering evacuation orders. Wildlife and fisheries[edit]: As the surrounding air was extremely hot, water temperatures rose, which proved to be a hazard for aquatic wildlife. On the Pacific shore, temperatures in the intertidal zone reached up to 122 \u00b0F (50 \u00b0C) and more than a billion seashore animals, like clams, barnacles and oysters, died as a result of heat wave, impacting water quality. The deaths also impacted seafood producers, who faced losses of produce as it baked in the heatwave and started rotting. Inland, the population of sockeye salmon in Idaho rivers was preventatively caught out of water as increasing temperatures made it prone to disease; some salmon was also transported to cooler waters in the Columbia River. Fish kill, however, was not prevented in Alberta and appeared earlier than expected. The heat wave caused an increase in vibrio bacteria levels in oysters in the Pacific Northwest, causing a record number of people to be sickened from vibriosis, an intestinal disease caused by the bacteria. As a result, the Washington State Department of Health urged people not to eat raw oysters and other shellfish from the region. On the land, trees in Metro Vancouver dried up and started shedding leaves; the same happened to the fir canopy in Oregon on the side where the trees faced the sun. In Seattle, nearly a hundred juvenile terns, whose nests were on top of an industrial building, died when they plunged to the pavement below, presumably trying to escape the heat - those that survived were treated for burns. Scores of British Columbian raptors, apart from heat exhaustion, suffered from dehydration and starvation. See also[edit]: References[edit]: Further reading[edit]: External links[edit]:"
