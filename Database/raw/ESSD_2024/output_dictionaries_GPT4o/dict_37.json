            "Affected_with_annotation": "Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred displaced more than 50 families and caused CVE$250 million ($2.5 million) in damage, primarily to the agricultural and private sectors of the Barlavento Islands. Traversing the eastern islands on the afternoon of August 31, Fred brought strong thunderstorms with 60 mph (100 km/h) winds and 3.8 inches (96 mm) of rain to Boa Vista, uprooting trees, damaging roofs and plaster, and knocking out power to most of the population. The winds toppled a transmission tower in Sal Rei, disrupting cellphone services. Two inhabitants were taken to hospital for non-critical injuries after their home had partially collapsed. Floods swept through low-lying areas of Rabil and cut off the main road to surrounding towns, hampering emergency workers. The southern village of Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o Velha bore the brunt of the storm; about 70 percent of the houses there experienced some degree of damage, from broken tiles and windows to crumbled walls, with repair costs of CVE$3 million (US$30,000). A compromised infrastructure left the village without power and telephone services for five days. Throughout Boa Vista, estimated losses from Fred totaled CVE$76 million ($760,000), including CVE$26 million ($260,000) in restoration costs. Similar conditions occurred in parts of Sal. Along the island's southern shore, Fred's storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed the island's main tourist pier in Santa Maria. Restoration efforts had not yet been completed by May 2017, about 1.5 years after the hurricane; the delay led to concerns over the island's precarious, tourism-reliant economy. Hotels, restaurants, and beach facilities were flooded, and roads in the town became impassable. Gusts leveled the roof of a high school gym, which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100 citizens. Elsewhere on the island, the winds knocked out power to homes in Palmeira, and caused minor structural damage to Sal International Airport. At the height of the storm, floods forced nearly 130 people living in the impoverished outskirts of Terra Boa and Espargos to relocate to shelters. Fred destroyed 80 percent of the Loggerhead sea turtle nests on the beaches of Sal, crucial nesting sites for the species. Overall, the hurricane left CVE$30 million ($300,000) in damage across Sal. Fred produced strong winds and downpours across the mountainous northern islands of Barlavento. S\u00e3o Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80 mph (130 km/h)\u2014the highest official wind speed recorded during hurricane. Rainfall there was moderate, peaking at 3.5 in (90 mm) at Juncalinho. The blustery weather uprooted many old trees, triggered landslides, and left the villages on the island without power. The strong winds downed power poles and wrecked the roof of a church in the village of Cabe\u00e7alinho. In Ribeira Brava, S\u00e3o Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70 homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farmhouse, leaving some families homeless and others without a source of income. In Carri\u00e7al, the torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and hydroponic crops. Much of S\u00e3o Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from Hortel\u00e3, was lost in the storm. Damage to agriculture\u2014primarily banana and sugarcane\u2014and private property on the island reached CVE$50 million ($500,000). On the neighboring islands of S\u00e3o Vicente and Santo Ant\u00e3o, the storm's impact was limited to power outages, floods, and damaged crops. Santo Ant\u00e3o recorded light winds and 8 in (200 mm) of rain, although higher elevations received greater quantities. In Porto Novo, 35 people were relocated as floods swept through neighborhoods. The rain washed out the island's carrot, cabbage, and tomato plantations, especially in the vicinity of Alto Mira. On S\u00e3o Vicente, roads were closed in and around Laginha. Gusts toppled two trees, one striking a car and lightly injuring the driver. Hurricane-related costs for the two islands, mainly infrastructural repair, totaled CVE$16 million ($160,000). The impact of Fred on the Sotavento region was relatively minor. The storm's outer bands dropped heavy rain on the islands of Santiago and Fogo, peaking at 13 in (330 mm) in the mountains of Santiago and causing flood damage to roads, sidewalks, and walls. In S\u00e3o Miguel, on the former island, flood waters and fallen trees led to major traffic obstructions. Structural damage across Santiago, mostly due to urban flooding, reached CVE$87 million ($860,000). Conversely, the rains replenished dried-up water resources; a large reservoir in S\u00e3o Salvador do Mundo was filled to maximum capacity, irrigating adjacent arable lands."
