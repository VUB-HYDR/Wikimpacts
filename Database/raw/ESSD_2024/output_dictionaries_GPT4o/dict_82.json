    "Main_Event_Assessment_With_Annotation": "Based on the provided article Date: July 24-August 27, 2022 Location: Greater St. Louis, Central Appalachia, Southern and Southwestern United States Deaths: 44 deaths (Kentucky: 38 direct, 2 indirect; Missouri: 2; Texas: 1; Utah: 1)[1][2][3][4][5] Property damage: $1.2 billion (Kentucky and Missouri only)[6] Starting late on August 21, 2022, and going into the next morning, a significant flash flooding event occurred in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex in Texas, killing one person and injuring four others.[5] Some parts of the metroplex saw over 10 inches (250 mm) of rain, which is the usual rainfall total for the area during all of summer. Before this rainfall event, 2022 was shaping up to be one of the hottest and driest years ever recorded in Texas.[103] On the morning of August 21, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) issued a moderate risk for excessive rainfall for North and Northeast Texas.[104] On August 22, WPC issued a new moderate risk for excessive rainfall for North and Northeast Texas as well as portions of North Louisiana.[105] At 1:20 am. CDT on August 22, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the Dallas metroplex.[106] Overnight on August 21, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport reported 3.01 inches (76.5 mm) of rainfall over a one-hour timeframe, setting the record for the most rainfall in a single hour ever for the airport.[107] By 8 am. CDT on August 22, parts of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex had received over 10 inches (250 mm) of rain.[108] The amount of rainfall that Dallas normally sees during all of summer fell within 24 hours.[109][110][111] This broke a record for most rain in 24 hours since 1932.[112] Also, this made 2022 the wettest August in Dallas history.[113] This also meant that, despite 67 consecutive days with no measurable precipitation during the summer, Dallas still had their 9th wettest summer on record.[114] The flooding event caused over 314 car crashes and 319 high water calls. Parts of the Dallas area got up to 15.16 inches (385.1 mm) of rain.[115] Nearly 300 flights were cancelled and 900 were delayed between the two Dallas airports.[116] Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, and 37,000 other customers, lost power.[117] One person was killed and four people were injured in the floods.[118] Certain rivers reached moderate flood stage as they reached over 38 feet (12 m).[119] Around 10:15 am. CDT on August 22, the storms associated with the flooding event produced an EF1 tornado that impacted Smith County, approximately 100 miles (160 km) east of downtown Dallas. Minimal damage occurred to a school and other structures near Winona.[120] Due to the floods, drought improved across parts of northern Texas.[121]",
