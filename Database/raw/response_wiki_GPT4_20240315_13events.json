One of the first fires to have struck the region was the Lava Fire, burning west of Mount Shasta, California, caused by a lightning strike on June 25, and which eventually burned around 26,300 acres (106 km2) on the west slope of one of the highest peaks in the state. Some of the largest fires, such as the Beckwourth Complex Fire, grew over 100,000 acres (405 km2). Strong winds, which were causing fire tornadoes in some places, and dry vegetation hampered efforts to contain the fires. This led to road closures, such as the U.S. Route 97 and the North Cascades Highway, suspension of airport operations in Redmond, Oregon, and evacuation of settlements adjacent to the fires. The winds were so strong that residents of Medford, Oregon, c. 80 mi (130 km) north of the fires, reported having seen ash falling from the sky.\",\n    \"Drought\": \"In May, more than 75% of the western United States experienced drought conditions, with 21% of these conditions being deemed as 'exceptional drought', which is the most extreme level of drought. These extreme conditions result in a lack of moisture on the ground that is imperative for combating wildfires.\",\n    \"Flood\": \"The heat wave caused extensive melting of glaciers, which led to high amounts of runoff in rivers, triggering flash flooding down the creeks and rivers. Soot from wildfires is further expected to diminish the mass of ice. As the surrounding air was extremely hot, water temperatures rose, which proved to be a hazard for aquatic wildlife. On the Pacific shore, temperatures in the intertidal zone reached up to 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C) and more than a billion seashore animals, like clams, barnacles and oysters, died as a result of the heat wave, impacting water quality.\"\n  }\n}",

A peak two-minute sustained wind of 75 mph (121 km/h) and a gust to 92 mph (148 km/h) was observed at Cape Lookout. A gust to 93 mph (150 km/h) was observed on Cedar Island. Tropical storm-force wind gusts extended as far as 100 mi (155 km) inland. Persistent onshore flow resulted in the entire coastline experiencing a storm surge of at least 1 ft (0.30 m). Surge was greatest along the interior Pamlico Sound, especially along the lower reaches of the Newport, Neuse, and Pamlico Rivers; however, the peak coincided with low tide. A peak surge of 8 ft (2.4 m) occurred along Clubfoot Creek. The displacement of water left parts of the Sound's seafloor exposed. Ocean-facing coastlines of Carteret and Onslow Counties saw surges of 4 to 6 ft (1.2 to 1.8 m). Near Atlantic Beach, two cannons, an anchor, and other debris from the Queen Anne's Revenge were uncovered by churning waters. Heavy rain accompanied the storm's three-day impact, with the greatest totals occurring along the immediate coastline. Peak accumulations were concentrated in Brunswick County, reaching a maxima of 17.5 in (440 mm) at the Oak Island water treatment plant. Accumulations as much as 12 in (300 mm) extended northward to Oracoke Island. Trace amounts of rain fell across half the state.\"\n}",

As such, 462 dropsondes were deployed in the storm between September 6 and 17, the second-most in a single storm during 2005, only behind the 503 dropped into Hurricane Rita later in September. The Naval Research Laboratory in conjunction with NOAA conducted research flights into the tropical depression that became Ophelia on September 6.

The highest temperature recorded was 47.0 \u00c2\u00b0C (116.6 \u00c2\u00b0F) in Pinh\u00c3\u00a3o, Portugal, on 14 July.\"\n}",
            "{\n  \"Perils\": \"Heatwave|Drought|Wildfire\",\n  \"Perils_Assessment_With_Annotation\": \"The June heatwave was the result of an interaction among the high pressures that generate atmospheric stability; Tropical Storm Alex, the strong sunshine of the boreal summer and an air mass emanating from North Africa that had entered the Iberian Peninsula loaded with suspended dust that caused haze in the centre and south of the peninsula. Climatologists linked the extreme heat to the impact of climate change, and experts predict that changes in the jet stream as a result of climate change will cause heatwaves with increasing frequency in Europe. Furthermore, due to the jet stream, the increase in heatwaves for European countries is three-to-four times higher than other countries in northern mid-latitudes, such as the United States. As a result of the heatwaves, widespread droughts occurred across the continent. Eurostat reported that the European Union saw 53,000 excess deaths in July, some of which may have occurred because of the heat wave. The excess death rate was several times higher than in July 2020 or July 2021, a statistic notable due to the COVID-19 pandemic having taken place in Europe during those years. The worst increases were seen in Spain and Cyprus. In Italy, the number of wildfires was three times the historical average by the end of June. Temperatures in Rome reached 40.8\u00b0C (105.4\u00b0F) on 28 June. On 22 July, sixteen cities including Rome were put on the red state of alert, the country's highest heatwave alert to warn of serious health risks. A glacier collapse on the mountain of Marmolada on 4 July killed eleven, and was attributed to the abnormally warm temperatures. On 5 July, a state of emergency was declared in five northern regions in response to a severe drought in the Po valley, the worst in 70 years, and later for Tuscany. In total, an estimated 18,010 excess deaths were reported due to the heat wave.\"\n}",
