Some of the worst damage from the flood was in the district of Ahrweiler, Rhineland-Palatinate, where the river Ahr rose, destroying many buildings and causing at least 110 deaths. On 14 July, the city of Hagen declared a state of emergency, after the Volme river started overflowing its banks. The village of Kordel in Trier-Saarburg, which has around 2,000 residents, has been completely cut off. Several rivers reached their highest water level to date, including the Kyll, which rose from an average level of 1 metre (3.3 ft) to 7.85 metres (25.8 ft). On 15 July, Thalys train services to Germany were suspended, and Deutsche Bahn stated that many rail services in North Rhine-Westphalia were also cancelled. Deutsche Bahn reported that over 600 kilometres (370 mi) of track was affected in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Cologne\u2013Wuppertal\u2013Hagen\u2013Dortmund and Cologne\u2013Bonn (Main Central Station)\u2013Koblenz lines were closed. The Cologne\u2013Bonn Beuel\u2013Koblenz line remained open, but trains were subject to delay and cancellation. Customers were asked to avoid travel within and to North Rhine-Westphalia by train. The train connection from Dresden to Prague was also suspended after mudslides buried the tracks. Along the Ahr Valley Railway, at least seven railway bridges have been destroyed. In Blessem, floodwaters of the Erft river inundated a quarry on 16 July, leading to a major landslide with several people possibly dead. Several buildings collapsed including parts of Burg Blessem. Around 40 meters of the nearby Bundesautobahn 1 broke away and fell into the Erft, but no cars were on the highway since it was closed. Experts voiced concerns on 15 July that the Steinbachtal Dam was unstable and could burst, and 4,500 people were preemptively evacuated from parts of Euskirchen, and later several thousand more from parts of Rheinbach and Swisttal. Drones were deployed to inspect the dam; while no cracks were found, local politicians said the situation as of 16 July remained 'critical'. Several other dams in North Rhine-Westphalia, such as the Rur Dam, were also overflowing, but there were no concerns about their structural integrity. Regardless, on 16 July a dam of the Rur burst near Wassenberg, prompting the evacuation of Ophoven. Around 360 inmates had to be evacuated from a prison near Euskirchen due to a failing supply of water and electricity. In Eschweiler, all of the more than 300 patients of the St.-Antonius-Hospital Eschweiler had to be evacuated. On 14 July, in Hagen, a veteran soldier rescued a 13-year-old girl who required mechanical ventilation as well as two elderly people using a MAN KAT1 which was usually exhibited in a local museum, after regular rescue vehicles were unable to get there in time. Strong rainfall also led to flooding in the states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Saxony. As of 15 July, one person in Saxony remains missing.

It then quickly crossed into Polk County and moved along the north shore of the lake, blowing down several trees while throwing several others into the lake. The tornado then rapidly strengthened as it briefly moved over the north part of the lake before causing major damage in Onalaska. Reaching low-end EF3 intensity, it first struck the Paradise Acres community on a small peninsula in the northwestern part of town. Numerous homes and manufactured homes were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area, and many trees were snapped or denuded as well. A few well-built frame homes sustained loss of their roofs and exterior walls along this segment of the path. It then moved back over Lake Livingston before moving ashore on the north side of Onalaska. The tornado was slightly weaker here, but still produced widespread high-end EF2 damage as many manufactured and site-built homes in neighborhoods south of FM 356 were damaged or destroyed, with debris strewn throughout the area. Dozens of trees were snapped or uprooted as the tornado crossed FM 356 before it entered another neighborhood on the northeast side of town. Several frame homes had their roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed along and east of FM 3459 while other manufactured homes were completely destroyed. All three deaths and 33 injuries from the tornado occurred in Onalaska. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast out of Onalaska and crossed over the extreme northeastern part of Lake Livingston. Trees and homes along the shore were damaged at EF1 strength before the tornado moved into rural areas of Polk County and crossed FM 3152, mostly snapping or uprooting countless hardwood and softwood trees, although one house along FM 350 suffered roof damage. The tornado then reached its peak width of over one-half-mile (0.80 km) wide as it tore through the north side of Seven Oaks while restrengthening to EF2 intensity. Two mobile homes were completely destroyed as the tornado crossed US 59 and hardwood trees in the area were snapped, denuded, and partially debarked. The tornado then weakened back to EF1 strength as it continued to the east-northeast, damaging more trees, including one large tree that fell on a mobile home, destroying it while barely missing a man sitting at his computer. The tornado then dissipated near FM 942 southwest of Barnes at 6:15 p.m. CDT (23:15 UTC).",

It then quickly crossed into Polk County and moved along the north shore of the lake, blowing down several trees while throwing several others into the lake. The tornado then rapidly strengthened as it briefly moved over the north part of the lake before causing major damage in Onalaska. Reaching low-end EF3 intensity, it first struck the Paradise Acres community on a small peninsula in the northwestern part of town. Numerous homes and manufactured homes were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area, and many trees were snapped or denuded as well. A few well-built frame homes sustained loss of their roofs and exterior walls along this segment of the path. It then moved back over Lake Livingston before moving ashore on the north side of Onalaska. The tornado was slightly weaker here, but still produced widespread high-end EF2 damage as many manufactured and site-built homes in neighborhoods south of FM 356 were damaged or destroyed, with debris strewn throughout the area. Dozens of trees were snapped or uprooted as the tornado crossed FM 356 before it entered another neighborhood on the northeast side of town. Several frame homes had their roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed along and east of FM 3459 while other manufactured homes were completely destroyed. All three deaths and 33 injuries from the tornado occurred in Onalaska. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast out of Onalaska and crossed over the extreme northeastern part of Lake Livingston. Trees and homes along the shore were damaged at EF1 strength before the tornado moved into rural areas of Polk County and crossed FM 3152, mostly snapping or uprooting countless hardwood and softwood trees, although one house along FM 350 suffered roof damage. The tornado then reached its peak width of over one-half-mile (0.80 km) wide as it tore through the north side of Seven Oaks while restrengthening to EF2 intensity. Two mobile homes were completely destroyed as the tornado crossed US 59 and hardwood trees in the area were snapped, denuded, and partially debarked. The tornado then weakened back to EF1 strength as it continued to the east-northeast, damaging more trees, including one large tree that fell on a mobile home, destroying it while barely missing a man sitting at his computer. The tornado then dissipated near FM 942 southwest of Barnes at 6:15 p.m. CDT (23:15 UTC).",

Despite deployment of more than 17,000 firefighters by mid-July, the size and number of the fires grew. Almost 1,000,000 acres (4,050 km2) of forest were consumed by large wildfires, and more than 2,250,000 acres (9,110 km2) were burnt in the United States as of July 15. The intensity of the fires moved the US fire preparedness alert level to 5 (highest) by July 14, which was an early start of the wildfire season. In addition to that, the Governors of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho declared states of emergency due to the extreme risk of wildfires. The Canadian army officials set up a coordination center in Edmonton in order to assist wildfire actions in British Columbia, which would be directed until July 19. As the extreme heat and dry conditions persisted, scientists, firefighters and various politicians urged residents not to use fireworks during Independence Day celebrations in the Western United States and on Canada Day in Alberta. In addition to that, Washington and British Columbia enacted state-/provincewide bans on most open fires. Other areas such as Idaho and Manitoba used more localized approaches to burn restrictions. As of September 14, 2021, the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) reported that 44,647 wildfires in the United States had burned 5.6 million acres of land. Similarly, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) announced that 6,317 wildfires burned 10.34 million acres. Due to the earliness and severity of the wildfire season, the United States and Canada were unable to provide each other with aid to jointly combat fires. Initially, the NIFC declared that the United States and Canada had a preparedness level of 5, meaning it had the potential to exhaust firefighting resources. However, by September 20, 2021, the national preparedness level was reduced to 4 and 1 for the United States and Canada, respectively. Prior to the start of the extreme heat wave, wildfire risk was greatly elevated by existing weather conditions. In April 2021, the North American wildfire season was predicted to be severe due to record drought conditions and high spring temperatures in the West. In May, more than 75% of the western United States experienced drought conditions, with 21% of these conditions being deemed as 'exceptional drought', which is the most extreme level of drought. These extreme conditions result in a lack of moisture on the ground that is imperative for combating wildfires. In Arizona, there were 311 early wildfires in the first four months of the year, compared to 127 in the same period in 2020. In July 2021, haze from West Coast fires resulted in air quality alerts in East Coast cities. In Montana, evacuation orders had displaced around 600 people by early August. On October 21, the national preparedness level was lowered to 1, while by November 5, a total of 48,725 wildfires had burned more than 6.5 million acres across the United States, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). Glacier melt[edit]: Extreme temperatures were also noted for mountain regions, which accelerated the melting of glaciers. Extensive melting occurred in the snowcaps of Banff National Park, which a glaciologist estimated that the Albertan snow from the mountains melted three times faster than usual. On Mount Rainier, the heat wave caused the mass of the snow cap to shrink by 30%, and Washington's glaciers in general have come through what glaciologists say to be the strongest melting episode in 100 years. Additionally, the increased melting of glaciers caused high amounts of runoff to be present within some rivers. The unexpected snowmelt resulted in extensive flash flooding down the creeks and rivers fed by the glaciers, triggering evacuation orders. Wildlife and fisheries[edit]: As the surrounding air was extremely hot, water temperatures rose, which proved to be a hazard for aquatic wildlife. On the Pacific shore, temperatures in the intertidal zone reached up to 122 \u00b0F (50 \u00b0C) and more than a billion seashore animals, like clams, barnacles and oysters, died as a result of heat wave, impacting water quality. The deaths also impacted seafood producers, who faced losses of produce as it baked in the heatwave and started rotting. Inland, the population of sockeye salmon in Idaho rivers was preventatively caught out of water as increasing temperatures made it prone to disease; some salmon was also transported to cooler waters in the Columbia River. Fish kill, however, was not prevented in Alberta and appeared earlier than expected. The heat wave caused an increase in vibrio bacteria levels in oysters in the Pacific Northwest, causing a record number of people to be sickened from vibriosis, an intestinal disease caused by the bacteria. As a result, the Washington State Department of Health urged people not to eat raw oysters and other shellfish from the region. On the land, trees in Metro Vancouver dried up and started shedding leaves; the same happened to the fir canopy in Oregon on the side where the trees faced the sun. In Seattle, nearly a hundred juvenile terns, whose nests were on top of an industrial building, died when they plunged to the pavement below, presumably trying to escape the heat - those that survived were treated for burns. Scores of British Columbian raptors, apart from heat exhaustion, suffered from dehydration and starvation. See also[edit]: References[edit]: Further reading[edit]: External links[edit]:"

State irrigation minister said that in some districts of south Bengal, there had been around 400 mm rainfall during the last three days. The rivers Silabati in West Midnapore, Dwarkeswar in Bankura, Dwaraka and Kuye in Birbhum were flowing above the danger level. Some villages at Suri block II got flooded due to incessant rain. Some parts of the Hooghly and West Midnapore, including Ghatal, Khirpai, Chandrakona went under water since Saturday night. Bankura recorded the state's highest rainfall at 274 mm during the same period, while Digha recorded 104 mm, Halisahar recorded 189 mm and Burdwan received 72.6 mm of rains.[4]",
            "Flood": "Following heavy rain in July and August 2017, the Indian state of West Bengal was affected by severe flooding.[2] The floods were reported to have caused 50 deaths since 1 August and 8 deaths in the neighbouring state of Jharkhand.[3] Soon after these floods, North Bengal also witnessed floods that wreaked havoc over the seven districts and killed 3 people. The water discharge from DVC dams was in excess of that in 1978 which saw an unprecedented flood in the state. So far 2.78 lakh (278 thousand) cusecs of water had been discharged by DVC as of 1 August. The situation in Bengal got worse on Thursday after Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) released more water from its dams and sounded a red alert in the lower catchment areas of the Damodar river. An additional 249,450 cusecs[5] of water was released from Durgapur barrage on Thursday morning. As a result, more areas in east Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah were hit by flood.[5] The flood affected districts had received record rainfall from 20 to 25 July. Compared to the normal rainfall received in July, Bankura received 754 per cent, Burdwan 334 per cent, Birbhum 313 per cent, East Midnapore 500 per cent, West Midnapore 424 per cent, Howrah 427 per cent, Hooghly 359 per cent, Kolkata 367 per cent, Murshidabad 174 per cent, and Purulia 721 per cent more rainfall. The cumulative rainfall received in Birbhum from 20 to 26 July was over 600 mm. From the weather system, the capital city of Kolkata received 142 mm of rain in 48 hours. July 2017 was the second wettest in Kolkata since 2008 with rain count 72% above the normal mark \u2013 the city received 621.5 mm rain. Only once \u2013 in 2015 \u2013 in the last decade has Kolkata received more rain in July from Cyclone Komen.[6]"

At least 2,082 structures in Florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed. About 1,355 other dwellings experienced minor losses. Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane, no hurricane-force winds were reported. Along the coast abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage, especially between Apalachicola and Cedar Key. Light to moderate rainfall was reported in Florida, though no significant flooding occurred. In Georgia, damage was limited to two tornadoes, which caused approximately $275,000 in losses. Minimal effects were also recorded in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Tennessee; though one fatality was reported in Delaware. The most significant effects, by far, occurred in Pennsylvania, mostly due to intense flooding. The hurricane severely flooded the Susquehanna River and the Lackawanna River causing major damage to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metropolitan area. In both Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined, about 43,594 structures were either destroyed or significantly damaged.",

The system steadily became better organized, and the next day, a tropical depression had developed. Satellite intensity estimates gradually increased, and on July 23, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alex. After initially tracking west-northwest, Tropical Storm Alex started tracking northwest. An eye developed on July 24, and on the next day, Alex was classified as a typhoon, when Alex attained its peak intensity of 120 km/h (75 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970 mbar (29 inHg).",

By noon, almost 40 landslides and 156 floods were reported. In Tsim Sha Tsui, the 124-year record of rainfall per hour was smashed, with 145.5 mm (5.73 inches) of rainfall being recorded. The North Lantau Highway was blocked, for the first and so far the only time since its opening in 1997, by a landslide. Land traffic to the villages of Tai O was cut off, forcing the government to increase the frequency of ferries to and from the villages. Newspaper vendors in the streets reported that the water came very fast, flooding the area within five minutes to thigh-deep level (over-the-knee). One of the landslides killed two people in Tuen Mun. The Hong Kong Observatory thus changed the 'amber rainstorm' warning to a 'black rainstorm' warning."

Up to 40 cars were pulled from flooded streets, some being submerged with 2 ft (0.6 m) of water. Damages from the flooding was estimated at $10,000. In Georgia, the storm produced 3.48 inches (88 mm) of rain, while in South Carolina, 2.60 inches (66 mm) was recorded. On July 20, Cristobal skirted eastern North Carolina, resulting in minimal damage. Along the coast, water levels rose 1 foot (0.30 m) above normal; rough surf was also reported. Rainfall averaged 0.5 to 1.5 inches (13 to 38 mm), though the NEXRAD weather radar estimates indicated that isolated amounts exceeded 4 inches (100 mm). The storm dropped 3.43 in (87 mm) in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding occurred. Because the bulk of the storm remained over open waters, winds along the coast ran about 25 mph (40 km/h)."

                "Affected_with_annotation": "Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred displaced more than 50 families and caused CVE$250 million ($2.5 million) in damage, primarily to the agricultural and private sectors of the Barlavento Islands. Traversing the eastern islands on the afternoon of August 31, Fred brought strong thunderstorms with 60 mph (100 km/h) winds and 3.8 inches (96 mm) of rain to Boa Vista, uprooting trees, damaging roofs and plaster, and knocking out power to most of the population. The winds toppled a transmission tower in Sal Rei, disrupting cellphone services. Two inhabitants were taken to hospital for non-critical injuries after their home had partially collapsed. Floods swept through low-lying areas of Rabil and cut off the main road to surrounding towns, hampering emergency workers. The southern village of Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o Velha bore the brunt of the storm; about 70 percent of the houses there experienced some degree of damage, from broken tiles and windows to crumbled walls, with repair costs of CVE$3 million (US$30,000). A compromised infrastructure left the village without power and telephone services for five days. Throughout Boa Vista, estimated losses from Fred totaled CVE$76 million ($760,000), including CVE$26 million ($260,000) in restoration costs. Similar conditions occurred in parts of Sal. Along the island's southern shore, Fred's storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed the island's main tourist pier in Santa Maria. Restoration efforts had not yet been completed by May 2017, about 1.5 years after the hurricane; the delay led to concerns over the island's precarious, tourism-reliant economy. Hotels, restaurants, and beach facilities were flooded, and roads in the town became impassable. Gusts leveled the roof of a high school gym, which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100 citizens. Elsewhere on the island, the winds knocked out power to homes in Palmeira, and caused minor structural damage to Sal International Airport. At the height of the storm, floods forced nearly 130 people living in the impoverished outskirts of Terra Boa and Espargos to relocate to shelters. Fred destroyed 80 percent of the Loggerhead sea turtle nests on the beaches of Sal, crucial nesting sites for the species. Overall, the hurricane left CVE$30 million ($300,000) in damage across Sal. Fred produced strong winds and downpours across the mountainous northern islands of Barlavento. S\u00e3o Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80 mph (130 km/h)\u2014the highest official wind speed recorded during hurricane. Rainfall there was moderate, peaking at 3.5 in (90 mm) at Juncalinho. The blustery weather uprooted many old trees, triggered landslides, and left the villages on the island without power. The strong winds downed power poles and wrecked the roof of a church in the village of Cabe\u00e7alinho. In Ribeira Brava, S\u00e3o Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70 homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farmhouse, leaving some families homeless and others without a source of income. In Carri\u00e7al, the torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and hydroponic crops. Much of S\u00e3o Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from Hortel\u00e3, was lost in the storm. Damage to agriculture\u2014primarily banana and sugarcane\u2014and private property on the island reached CVE$50 million ($500,000). On the neighboring islands of S\u00e3o Vicente and Santo Ant\u00e3o, the storm's impact was limited to power outages, floods, and damaged crops. Santo Ant\u00e3o recorded light winds and 8 in (200 mm) of rain, although higher elevations received greater quantities. In Porto Novo, 35 people were relocated as floods swept through neighborhoods. The rain washed out the island's carrot, cabbage, and tomato plantations, especially in the vicinity of Alto Mira. On S\u00e3o Vicente, roads were closed in and around Laginha. Gusts toppled two trees, one striking a car and lightly injuring the driver. Hurricane-related costs for the two islands, mainly infrastructural repair, totaled CVE$16 million ($160,000). The impact of Fred on the Sotavento region was relatively minor. The storm's outer bands dropped heavy rain on the islands of Santiago and Fogo, peaking at 13 in (330 mm) in the mountains of Santiago and causing flood damage to roads, sidewalks, and walls. In S\u00e3o Miguel, on the former island, flood waters and fallen trees led to major traffic obstructions. Structural damage across Santiago, mostly due to urban flooding, reached CVE$87 million ($860,000). Conversely, the rains replenished dried-up water resources; a large reservoir in S\u00e3o Salvador do Mundo was filled to maximum capacity, irrigating adjacent arable lands."

According to Primary Industries Minister, Ed Casey, \"the drought affected region stretched in a 200 km to 300 km wide strip from Stanthorpe to Charters Towers\".[23] So few wheat and barley crops survived, about half the usual for that year, that grains had to be imported from other states.[24] In June 1994, more than ten towns had lost irrigation systems; and some areas had gone five years without decent rainfall.[23] A part of the upper Darling River system collapsed during this drought. By October 1994, the Condamine River was exhausted, reverting to a series of ponds. Across the state, in more than 13,000 properties, totaling 40% of Queensland, was drought declared.[25] The flow past Goondiwindi was the lowest since 1940. Cotton farms near Moree and Narrabri had been allocated no water for irrigation, which resulted in a major loss of production.[25] The town of Warwick was particularly affected.",

Tracking northwest within an environment conducive for strengthening, Polo intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and reached peak winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) by 00:00 UTC on September 18 as an eye became evident on satellite imagery. A sharp increase in wind shear quickly thereafter caused the storm's center to become exposed, and a reconnaissance mission indicated that Polo weakened to a tropical storm by 18:00 UTC that day. After maintaining intensity for about a day, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC on September 22 and further decreased into a remnant low six hours later. The low turned southwestward before dissipating well southwest of the southern tip of Baja California on September 26.",

Ignition of the phase-1 burn was scheduled for May 4, 2000. Timeline[edit]: Aftermath[edit]: Flash floods[edit]: A particular concern was the possibility of flooding in areas downstream from the burned zone. The town of Los Alamos, the national laboratory, and the lower parts of the burned area are all situated on the Pajarito Plateau, an area of extensive canyons and mesas in which surface runoff tends to concentrate in the canyon bottoms. This tendency was exacerbated in Cerro Grande's aftermath because the soil in the burned areas had become hydrophobic, raising the specter of drastically increased water flow in the streams in the canyons that the existing streambeds might not have been able to handle. This concern, coupled with the prospect of monsoon rains that typically begin in about July in the area, made dealing with the possibility of flooding urgent. The highest priority for flood management involved the Los Alamos Critical Experiments Facility (LACEF),[4] a remote site for conducting research in nuclear criticality safety that housed substantial quantities of special nuclear material. The LACEF laboratories were in the bottom of Pajarito Canyon. A month after the fire, a 'short-duration (30-minute), relatively moderate-intensity thunderstorm'[5] caused a brief, heavy flood in this canyon upstream of LACEF. 'The maximum estimated peak flow in Pajarito Canyon upstream of State Road (SR) 501 was 1020 cfs, an all-time record for watersheds gaged by LANL on the Pajarito Plateau ...'[5] To protect LACEF, a large, temporary 'dry dam' was constructed in the canyon upstream of LACEF to temporarily contain flash floods that might result if an intense thunderstorm happened to rain heavily on the terrain drained by Pajarito Canyon. Runoff was monitored at multiple stations in the headwater streams above Pajarito Canyon. In the event, the monsoon of the summer of 2000 was not particularly intense, and damage from flooding was generally minimal. No severe flooding occurred in Pajarito Canyon before vegetation upstream had recovered sufficiently, over several years, to retain runoff, and the dry dam eventually was removed. Severe flooding did occur in upper Pueblo Canyon, significantly damaging Diamond Drive, one of the town's arterial roads. Water quality was monitored by LANL for several years in the aftermath of the fire.[5] Erosion[edit]: Although flash floods were fortuitously minimal, erosion nonetheless was substantial, and many miles of the 57-mile network of trails maintained by Los Alamos County were severely damaged. Canyon bottoms in particular were clogged with fallen trees and boulders washed down from above. Erosion might have been far worse, had there not been timely intervention. A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team was assigned to assess the damage and to implement a rehabilitation plan to reduce further natural resource damage. During July 2000, about 7000 hydromulching and hydroseeding flights by air tractors were carried out on 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) of the burned area to reduce erosion and speed revegetation. A local trail work organization, Volunteer Task Force, devoted many thousands of hours to rebuilding trails and planting trees. Local school children made many thousands of 'seed balls', which they broadcast in the burned areas to accelerate regrowth of the vegetation. To control erosion mechanically, Los Alamos County work crews laid thousands of trees across slopes, and chipped other trees. Damage to buildings[edit]: The presence of Los Alamos National Laboratory in and downstream of the burned area posed several unusual problems in remediation, beyond the ones resulting directly from destruction of some of the institution's buildings by fire. Other problems arose from fire-generated soot that seeped into buildings, shorting out electrical equipment and clogging HEPA filters necessary to the operation of clean rooms at some of the laboratories. Resolving these problems took several years in some cases. Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mobilized to provide relief to the residents of Los Alamos who had been burned out of their homes.[6] A compound of portable buildings ('trailers'), known locally as FEMAville, was constructed on undeveloped land near the county rodeo grounds on North Mesa, providing housing for hundreds of displaced residents. Some residents complained about the timeliness and thoroughness of the FEMA response. The trailers became available only in late June 2000, after municipal utilities were completed and the trailers were delivered and hooked up to the utilities. By 2006, all the trailers were removed and most of the displaced residents were settled into new homes, although reconstruction of houses in the burned area continues as of 2008[update]. In 2007, the former FEMAville site was proposed as a full-service RV park. This proposal was soundly rejected by residents and the FEMAville acreage remains open space. Adjacent communities[edit]: Santa Clara Canyon, home to Puye Cliff Dwellings, was devastated by Cerro Grande. The people of Santa Clara Pueblo, who formerly earned income through tourism, now operate the Santa Claran Casino in Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico. On June 20, 2000, residents of Isleta and Sandia Pueblos hired four environmental engineers to permanently work with the Cerro Grande Wild Fire aftermath. A 40-member forestry crew with members from the Eight Northern Pueblos has built 3,000 small dams (to minimize siltation of Santa Clara Creek), and planted one million trees on 3,500 acres (14 km2). On June 21, 2000, the laboratory acknowledged measurements were 10 to 20 times above background levels but that analysis by it and other agencies still indicated all of the contamination came from natural radiation sources in vegetation that burned, principally from the decay of natural radon.[7] An investigation funded by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) and the Department of Energy (DOE) concluded no significant increase in health risk from LANL-derived chemicals and radionuclides released in the air.[5] Future[edit]: In August 2000, a review of the events leading up to the prescribed fire and how it was managed resulted in lessons learned and recommendations for fuel reduction from the US General Accounting Office.[2] The far larger Rodeo-Chediski Fire in Arizona, as well as several other fires in the Western United States in 2002, completed the process of bringing forest fires into political focus, leading to the establishment of the Healthy Forests Initiative in 2003. This initiative remains controversial, and its applicability to the relatively sparse forests of the Jemez Mountains that were consumed in the Cerro Grande Fire is unclear. Clearly, though, significant thinning of the coniferous forest of the Jemez has occurred in the years following Cerro Grande. The evaluation of the aftermath of this fire points to a bigger problem, loss of land to poor handling of natural resources. At the time of the fire, the area of logged forest amounted to 100,000 acres, this in comparison to forest lost from prescribed fires amounting to 2 and half million acres.[6] The GAO, Government Accountability Office, concluded that suppression tactics used by park service in response to fire were more apparently aimed at following through with the original goals of the prescribed fire and not minimizing the fire getting out of control.[7] The goal is to reduce the build up of dead wood and brush on the ground, called fuels, to minimize the risk of destructive wildfires spreading to surrounding communities.[8] The local community has also taken many steps to prevent and protect against future wildfires, including removing vegetation around buildings to increase defensible space, replacing roof and sheathing materials (e.g. cedar shakes) with less flammable materials, and continued thinning and reduction of fuels in unburned wooded areas in and around town, particularly in the canyons below populated mesas. Inferno by Committee, a detailed history of the fire and what went wrong, was published by firefighter Tom Ribe in 2010.[9] Image gallery[edit]: References[edit]:",

The fire was initially reported at 3:10 pm on Monday, June 26, off of Highway 79 in the Lamb Canyon area, burning with a rapid rate of spread in heavy grass and chaparral. First reported to be 40 acres in size, the fire soon ballooned to 500 to then 1,200 acres within the next three hours as hot, dry, windy conditioned fueled the flames burning in already rugged terrain. At 11:45 pm, 8 hours after the fires ignition, Cal Fire reported the fire to be 5,000 acres in size. Overnight, the fire advanced toward the Silver Fire burn area of August 2013 where it would later burn itself out. By Tuesday morning, the fire was estimated at 5,800 acres in size with no structures destroyed. However, the areas of Poppet Flats and Silent Valley were still under an evacuation warning.

On January 28, 2021, a voluntary evacuation order was issued in anticipation of a rain storm that posed a threat of mudflows.

On December 14, 2021, a large storm swept through the Southern California area, triggering mudflows in Silverado Canyon for the third time since the Bond Fire. On December 23, 2021, Silverado Canyon experienced more mudflows related to the winter rain frequent in the region's Mediterranean (Csa) climate."

Before this rainfall event, 2022 was shaping up to be one of the hottest and driest years ever recorded in Texas.[103] On the morning of August 21, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) issued a moderate risk for excessive rainfall for North and Northeast Texas.[104] On August 22, WPC issued a new moderate risk for excessive rainfall for North and Northeast Texas as well as portions of North Louisiana.[105] At 1:20 am. CDT on August 22, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the Dallas metroplex.[106] Overnight on August 21, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport reported 3.01 inches (76.5 mm) of rainfall over a one-hour timeframe, setting the record for the most rainfall in a single hour ever for the airport.[107] By 8 am. CDT on August 22, parts of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex had received over 10 inches (250 mm) of rain.[108] The amount of rainfall that Dallas normally sees during all of summer fell within 24 hours.[109][110][111] This broke a record for most rain in 24 hours since 1932.[112] Also, this made 2022 the wettest August in Dallas history.[113] This also meant that, despite 67 consecutive days with no measurable precipitation during the summer, Dallas still had their 9th wettest summer on record.[114] The flooding event caused over 314 car crashes and 319 high water calls. Parts of the Dallas area got up to 15.16 inches (385.1 mm) of rain.[115] Nearly 300 flights were cancelled and 900 were delayed between the two Dallas airports.[116] Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, and 37,000 other customers, lost power.[117] One person was killed and four people were injured in the floods.[118] Certain rivers reached moderate flood stage as they reached over 38 feet (12 m).[119] Around 10:15 am. CDT on August 22, the storms associated with the flooding event produced an EF1 tornado that impacted Smith County, approximately 100 miles (160 km) east of downtown Dallas. Minimal damage occurred to a school and other structures near Winona.[120] Due to the floods, drought improved across parts of northern Texas.[121]",
