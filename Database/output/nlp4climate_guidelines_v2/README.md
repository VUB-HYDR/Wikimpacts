### Annotation Guidelines v2 (changes in the normalization of numbers)

The files in this directory are the same gpt output from the [nlp4climate](Database/output/nlp4climate) experiments but with the normalization rules for a revised version of the annotation guidelines (v2).

The [jupyter notebook HTML export](guidelines_v1_versus_v2.html) shows a comparison with all items that underwent a change in the dev and test sets for these two categories: `Damage` and `Deaths`.

The annotation guidelines [can be found here](https://onedrive.live.com/personal/78d0e12ab2e8ce00/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?resid=78D0E12AB2E8CE00!sb951b21f6a3b4408808a037df599c45d&cid=78d0e12ab2e8ce00&migratedtospo=true&app=Word) (you may need to request pormission to access the file).
