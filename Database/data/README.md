**Inflation Adjustment**

We obtained the original inflation table from [the Minneapolis Fed's consumer price index data](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1800-) and saved it as the `inflation_Index_orig.csv` file, which uses 1967 as the base year. In our database, we adjusted the inflation to 2024 values. To do this, we rescaled the inflation index to 2024, resulting in the `inflation_Index_2024.csv` file, which is used in our full-run database.
