        "content": " In July 2021, several European countries were affected by severe floods. Some were catastrophic, causing deaths and widespread damage. The floods started in the United Kingdom as flash floods causing some property damage and inconvenience. Later floods affected several river basins across Europe including Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.[8] At least 243 people died in the floods, including 196 in Germany,[9] 43 in Belgium,[2] two in Romania,[3] one in Italy[4] and one in Austria.[5] Belgian Minister of Home Affairs Annelies Verlinden described the events as \"one of the greatest natural disasters our country has ever known.\" German minister-president Malu Dreyer of the Rhineland-Palatinate state called the floods \"devastating\". In addition to the confirmed fatalities, the flooding led to widespread power outages, forced evacuations and damage to infrastructure and agriculture in the affected areas. The damage to infrastructure was especially severe in Belgium and Germany.[10] The floods are estimated to have cost up to \u20ac2.55 billion (US$3 billion) in insured losses, with the total damage costs being much higher,[11][12] at a minimum of \u20ac10 billion (US$11.8 billion).[6] In the aftermath, scientists, activists and reporters all highlighted the connection to global trends in extreme weather, especially more frequent heavy rainfall caused by climate change.[13]"

        "content": "Between 12 and 15 July 2021, heavy rain fell across the United Kingdom, western Germany, and neighbouring Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. A storm complex moved east from France into Germany and stalled over the region for two days. Precipitation was intense in the East of Belgium, with 271.5 millimetres (10.69\u00a0in) of rain over 48 hours in Jalhay and 217 millimetres (8.5\u00a0in) over 48 hours in Spa. Heavy rainfall was also seen in the south of North Rhine-Westphalia and north of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany where accumulations averaged 100 to 150\u00a0mm (3.9 to 5.9\u00a0in) in 24 hours, equivalent to more than a month's worth of rain. In Reifferscheid, 207\u00a0mm (8.1\u00a0in) fell within a nine-hour period while Cologne observed 154\u00a0mm (6.1\u00a0in) in 24 hours. Some of the affected regions may not have seen rainfall of this magnitude in the last 1,000 years.[14] Floods started in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland on 14 July 2021 after record rainfall across western Europe caused multiple rivers to burst their banks.[15] The European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) issued alerts of life-threatening floods in advance, which, although very vague, were delivered to national authorities.[16]"

In the town of Pepinster on the banks of the river Vesder, at least 20 houses collapsed and 23 of the 31 casualties as of 18 July were found here. The town of Verviers was also badly affected[25] and has more than 10,000 of its residents having to be moved because of homes having become uninhabitable. Widespread looting has also been a problem. Precipitation was most intense in the east of Belgium, with 271.5 millimetres (10.69\u00a0in) of rain over 48 hours in the municipality of Jalhay, in the province of Li\u00e8ge -- an absolute record for Belgium, almost three times the average rainfall over one month in this location for July. In the town of Spa, also in Li\u00e8ge, 217 millimetres (8.5\u00a0in) of rain fell over 48 hours.[26] An empty passenger train derailed at Grupont when the track bed was washed out by floodwater, with debris strewn across the track.[27] The Charleroi\u2013Namur\u2013Li\u00e8ge line, and all railway lines in Belgium south east of that line, were closed.[28] The overall damage to the rail network was estimated to take several weeks to repair.[29] Early estimates also pointed to severe damage to the agricultural sector of the country, including long-term effects like soil erosion. During the flooding itself, farms and livestock had to be evacuated and many fields were damaged and crops destroyed by inundation.[30] The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps suffered damage to access roads and its digital safety infrastructure.[31] The circuit was due to hold the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix on 29 August;[32] damage was repaired sufficiently to allow the race to go ahead, although it was ultimately cut short after just one lap by further torrential rainfall and flooding at the circuit. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo declared 20 July a national day of mourning.[33] In the evening of 24 July, southern and central parts of Belgium were hit again by severe flash floods as a result of intense but shorter thunderstorms. Particularly the city of Dinant and its surroundings in the province of Namur were badly hit, where tens of floating cars resulted in a pile-up and in damage to railroads.[34][35]"

On 14 July, the city of Hagen declared a state of emergency, after the Volme river started overflowing its banks.[53] The village of Kordel in Trier-Saarburg, which has around 2,000 residents, has been completely cut off.[52] Several rivers reached their highest water level to date, including the Kyll, which rose from an average level of 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) to 7.85 metres (25.8\u00a0ft).[58] On 15 July, Thalys train services to Germany were suspended,[59] and Deutsche Bahn stated that many rail services in North Rhine-Westphalia were also cancelled.[60] Deutsche Bahn reported that over 600 kilometres (370\u00a0mi) of track was affected in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Cologne\u2013Wuppertal\u2013Hagen\u2013Dortmund and Cologne\u2013Bonn (Main Central Station)\u2013Koblenz lines were closed. The Cologne\u2013Bonn Beuel\u2013Koblenz line remained open, but trains were subject to delay and cancellation.[28] Customers were asked to avoid travel within and to North Rhine-Westphalia by train.[61] The train connection from Dresden to Prague was also suspended after mudslides buried the tracks.[62] Along the Ahr Valley Railway, at least seven railway bridges have been destroyed.[63] In Blessem, floodwaters of the Erft river inundated a quarry on 16 July, leading to a major landslide with several people possibly dead.[64][65] Several buildings collapsed including parts of Burg Blessem\u00a0[de].[66] Around 40 meters of the nearby Bundesautobahn 1 broke away and fell into the Erft, but no cars were on the highway since it was closed.[65] Experts voiced concerns on 15 July that the Steinbachtal Dam was unstable and could burst, and 4,500 people were preemptively evacuated from parts of Euskirchen,[67] and later several thousand more from parts of Rheinbach and Swisttal.[68] Drones were deployed to inspect the dam; while no cracks were found, local politicians said the situation as of 16 July[update] remained \"critical\".[69] Several other dams in North Rhine-Westphalia, such as the Rur Dam, were also overflowing, but there were no concerns about their structural integrity.[69] Regardless, on 16 July a dam of the Rur burst near Wassenberg, prompting the evacuation of Ophoven\u00a0[de].[70][71] Around 360 inmates had to be evacuated from a prison near Euskirchen due to a failing supply of water and electricity.[72]  In Eschweiler, all of the more than 300 patients of the St.-Antonius-Hospital Eschweiler\u00a0[de] had to be evacuated.[73] On 14 July, in Hagen, a veteran soldier rescued a 13-year-old girl who required mechanical ventilation as well as two elderly people using a MAN KAT1 which was usually exhibited in a local museum, after regular rescue vehicles were unable to get there in time.[74] Strong rainfall also led to flooding in the states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Saxony. As of 15 July, one person in Saxony remains missing.[75] Further strong rainfall on 17 July caused flooding in Saxony and Bavaria  e.g. Berchtesgadener Ache, where at least one person died.[76][77] The flooding damaged the K\u00f6nigssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track where it washed away part of the track that will take until October 2022 to rebuild.[78] Direct damage caused by the flooding in Germany was estimated at \u20ac33.4 billion with further \u20ac7.1 billion in indirect damage.[79]"

On 15 July, King Willem Alexander and Queen M\u00e1xima visited the town.[84] After the floodwaters had receded, damage was assessed at \u20ac400 million, half of which was physical damage and half being business losses. 2,300 families were affected in the town, 700 homes were rendered uninhabitable, and a bridge had collapsed. As of 21 July, the town was still subject to an evacuation order.[85] The River Meuse in Limburg reached its highest summertime level in over 100 years, according to authorities, and was expected as of 15 July[update] to surpass the winter records set in 1993 and 1995.[86] On 14 July, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute gave a code red highest warning for Limburg. It was lowered to a yellow warning at around 03:50 local time on 15 July.[87] Over 400 houses in Limburg lost power according to electricity company Enexis.[87] As of 16\u00a0July\u00a02021[update], mass evacuations started in Limburg and 300 military personnel were deployed.[88] On 16 July, a dyke on the Juliana Canal seemed on the verge of breaking, leading to the evacuation of several villages. In the end, the dyke held. The Dutch government declared the flooding to be an official disaster. More than 10,000 people were evacuated in Venlo and the neighbouring communities Belfeld, Steyl and Arcen on the same evening.[89][90] The VieCuri Hospital\u00a0[nl] in Venlo was also evacuated as a precaution against flooding from the Maas. A total of 240 patients were transferred to other hospitals in the region. It reopened on 21 July.[91][92] Rainfall was in excess of 100 millimetres (3.9\u00a0in) in a day and 200 millimetres (7.9\u00a0in) over three days, said to be a once-in-a-millennium event.[91] The state of emergency in Limburg was lifted on 21 July. The Dutch Army was drafted in to assist in the cleanup and with repairing damage.[92] Heavy rain in the early hours of 25 July caused flooding in the north west of Friesland. In De Westereen, 104.7 millimetres (4.12\u00a0in) of rain fell. A nursing home was flooded and evacuated.[93]"

Both Putney in London and Chipstead in Surrey recorded more than 31\u00a0mm (1.2\u00a0in) of rainfall in a one-hour period, while other areas of London recorded over 76.2\u00a0mm (3.00\u00a0in) of rain in 90 minutes.[101] The London Fire Brigade received more than 1,000 calls relating to flooding incidents, as houses were evacuated and cars were submerged by quickly rising floodwaters.[100] Heavy rainfall caused sewer systems to overflow, unable to handle the sudden intensity of the rainfall, resulting in streets and buildings being flooded by sewage. Thames Water received more than 2,500 calls relating to overflowing sewage, stating that the rainfall had surpassed the design capability of their sewage system; the heaviest rainfall occurred close to high tide, resulting in sewers that empty into the River Thames being unable to do so.[100] In Notting Hill, floodwaters rose by 1.5\u00a0ft (0.46\u00a0m) in less than five minutes.[101] Sloane Square tube station was closed after floodwater from street level surged down stairways into the underground station; Chalk Farm, Hampstead and Wimbledon stations were also closed due to flooding.[100] There was also a reduced level of service at Euston railway station, the London terminus of the West Coast Main Line and across the London Overground and Thameslink networks.[100] Overnight into 13\u00a0July, more than 120 residents of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea were placed into emergency accommodation due to severe flooding in the borough.[102] Elsewhere in England, flooding was reported in the city of Southampton, blocking roads and railway lines.[102] On 25 July, London was again hit by thunderstorms and flash floods.

We have never seen such a disaster. It's really devastating.\"[105][106] On 16 July, the German Ministry of Defence declared a state of emergency in the parts of the country that were most affected.[107][46] German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on 17 July announced plans for a federal emergency aid of 300 million Euro.[72] The Belgian Minister of Home Affairs Annelies Verlinden described the events as \"one of the greatest natural disasters our country has ever known\" at a press conference on 19 July.[108] On 15 July, the Belgian royal couple King Philippe and Queen Mathilde traveled to Chaudfontaine, which had been particularly badly hit by the flooding.[109] The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen,[110] the EU Council President Charles Michel and the European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d all quickly provided statements of condolence for the victims and that the European Union was ready to help.[111] After a Belgian request, the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism was activated on 14 July, and a helicopter and a flood rescue team was sent from France to Belgium immediately after this. The EU also provided satellite imagery and mapping of affected areas.[112][113][114][115][116][117][118] British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said the UK was ready to provide assistance, while Italy and Austria offered to send flood rescue teams to affected areas in Belgium.[119][105] Pope Francis sent condolences and prayers.[110] The Italian firefighters sent to Belgium to rescue the victims of the flood that hit Central Europe rescued at least 40 people in Tilff\u00a0[fr], an area south of Li\u00e8ge.

Mann from Penn State University, Hayley Fowler of Newcastle University and Kai Kornhuber of Columbia University pointed to a slowing in the jet stream as a possible explanation.[124] Stefan Rahmstorf of the University of Potsdam warned that further losses of Arctic ice would likely result in a weaker jet stream and more extreme weather, saying \"we should not play with this sensitive climate system\".[132] In the aftermath of the flooding, a spokesperson of the World Meteorological Organization called for more action against climate change.[133] On 13 July 2023, the European Union declared 15 July as the Annual EU Day for the Victims of the Global Climate Crisis, the date was chosen to commemorate the floods of 2021.[134]"

Within the eight provinces, 20% of the farmland and 35% of the entire wheat crop was impacted.[4] By February 2011, the drought hit a total of up to 7,730,000 hectares (19,100,000 acres) of winter wheat that had already been planted.[1] Some lakes, including Lake Hong in Hubei province, dried up significantly, with the Hubei lake shrinking to one-eighth of its normal surface area and one-fifth its usual depth, forcing 3,234 local residents to relocate.[5] According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the potential of damage to China's wheat harvest was likely a factor in an increase of worldwide wheat prices in early 2011.[2] By the start of June, the drought had affected 35 million people, including 4.2 million facing a drinking water shortage. Direct economic damage had reached 15 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion USD), while several provinces resorted to using cloud seeding to induce artificial rain.[5] On 24 June, 3.65 million people and 3.47 million heads of livestock were short of drinking water in \nthe autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia and the provinces of Gansu and Shanxi despite the flooding in other parts of China.[6]"

On 11 February, it was announced that an estimated US$1 billion would be spent on obtaining water to be used on wheat fields, including drilling about 1,350 new wells and sending personnel from the China Geological Survey and the Ministry of Land and Resources to attempt to locate new below-ground water reserves.[3] On 9 and 10 February, cloud seeding had been used to induce rain, resulting in 3 millimetres (0.12\u00a0in) of snow.[4]  Indirectly, the government said it raised the prices of some grains, provided farmers with technological aid, and released grain from its reserves to avoid a spike in prices.[4] Some farmers affected by the drought criticized the government for not doing enough to support the agriculture industry during the drought, or for giving aid too late.[10] Others blamed the restrictions on using water from certain sources, intended to go to industrial or residential developments, for increasing the effects of the drought on their crops.[10]"

        "content": "  Severe Tropical Cyclone Monica was the most intense tropical cyclone, in terms of maximum sustained winds, on record to impact Australia. The 17th and final storm of the 2005\u201306 Australian region cyclone season, Monica originated from an area of low pressure off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 16 April 2006. The storm quickly developed into a Category\u00a01 cyclone the next day, at which time it was given the name Monica. Travelling towards the west, the storm intensified into a severe tropical cyclone before making landfall in Far North Queensland, near Lockhart River, on 19 April 2006. After moving over land, convection associated with the storm quickly became disorganised. On 20 April 2006, Monica emerged into the Gulf of Carpentaria and began to re-intensify. Over the following few days, deep convection formed around a 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi) wide eye. Early on 22 April 2006, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) assessed Monica to have attained Category\u00a05 status, on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also upgraded Monica to a Category\u00a05-equivalent cyclone, on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm attained its peak intensity the following day with winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 916 hPa (mbar; 27.05\u00a0inHg). On 24 April 2006, Monica made landfall about 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) west of Maningrida, at the same intensity. Rapid weakening took place as the storm moved over land. Less than 24\u00a0hours after landfall, the storm had weakened to a tropical low. The remnants of the former-Category\u00a05 cyclone persisted until 28 April 2006 over northern Australia. In contrast to the extreme intensity of the cyclone, relatively little structural damage resulted from it. No injuries were reported to have occurred during the storm's existence and losses were estimated to be A$6.6 million (US$5.1\u00a0million). However, severe environmental damage took place. In the Northern Territory, an area about 7,000\u00a0km2 (2,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) was defoliated by Monica's high wind gusts. In response to the large loss of forested area, it was stated that it would take several hundred years for the area to reflourish because of the large area it devastated."

        "content": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Monica originated from an area of low pressure that formed early on 16 April 2006 off the coast of Papua New Guinea.[1] The low quickly became organised, with deep convection developing over the low-pressure centre. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the system became increasingly organised.[2] Early the next day, the Bureau of Meteorology in Brisbane, Australia declared that the low had developed into a Category\u00a01 cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone scale, with winds reaching 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained).[3] Upon being classified as a cyclone, the storm was given the name Monica. At the same time, the JTWC designated Monica as Tropical Cyclone 23P.[4] Monica tracked generally westward, towards Far North Queensland, in response to a low to mid-level ridge to the south.[5] Low wind shear and good divergence in the path of the storm allowed for continued intensification as continued westward.[6] Late on 17 April, Monica intensified into a category\u00a02 cyclone, with winds reaching 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained).[1][3] By 1200\u00a0UTC on 18 April, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Monica to a severe tropical cyclone, a Category\u00a03 on the Australian scale.[3] This followed an increase in the storm's outflow and a fluctuating central dense overcast.[7] Several hours later, the JTWC upgraded Monica to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[4] During the afternoon of 19 April, the storm made landfall roughly 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) south-southeast of the Lockhart River with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained).[1][3] At the same time, the JTWC assessed Monica to have intensified into a Category\u00a02-equivalent storm with winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained).[4] Shortly after making landfall, convection associated with the storm deteriorated and the outflow became fragmented. A shortwave trough to the south caused the ridge steering Monica to weaken, leading to the cyclone moving slower.[8] After moving over land, the storm began to weaken, with the Bureau of Meteorology downgrading the storm to weaken to Category 1 cyclone[3] and the JTWC downgraded the cyclone to a tropical storm.[4] The following day, Monica moved offshore, entering the Gulf of Carpentaria. Once back over water, favourable atmospheric conditions allowed the storm to quickly intensify.[1] Within 24-hours of moving over water, Monica re-attained severe tropical cyclone status.[3] Following a shift in steering currents, the storm slowed significantly and turned north-westward.[1][9] Steady intensification continued through 22 April as the storm remained in a region of low wind shear and favourable diffluence.[10] Early on 22 April the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Monica to a Category\u00a05 severe tropical cyclone, the third of the season.[1][3] By this time, a 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi) wide eye had developed within the central dense overcast of the cyclone.[11] Later that day, the JTWC assessed Monica to have intensified into a Category 5-equivalent storm.[4] Cyclone Monica attained its peak intensity on 23 April near Cape Wessel with a barometric pressure 916 hPa (mbar; 27.05\u00a0inHg). Maximum winds were estimated at 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained) by the Bureau of Meteorology[1][3] while the JTWC assessed it to have attained winds of 285\u00a0km/h (177\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained).[4] Using the Dvorak technique, the peak intensity of the cyclone was estimated at T-number of 7.5 according to the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), yet the Advanced Dvorak Technique of the CIMSS automatically estimated at T8.0, the highest ranking on the Dvorak Scale.[12][13] However, since the JTWC, SAB and CIMSS are not the official warning centres for Australian cyclones, these intensities remain unofficial.[14] On 24 April, the mid-level ridge south of Monica weakened, causing the storm to turn towards the southwest.[11] Following this, the storm made landfall in the Northern Territory, roughly 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) west of Maningrida, as a Category\u00a05 cyclone with winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained).[1] Soon after making landfall, the storm weakened extremely quickly. Most of the convective activity associated with the storm dissipated within nine hours of moving onshore. This resulted in the storm's maximum winds decreasing by 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) in a 12-hour span.[3] After this rapid weakening, the storm turned sharply west moving over the town of Jabiru as a Category\u00a02 cyclone. Within six hours of passing this town, the Bureau of Meteorology downgraded Monica to a tropical low, as the storm was no longer producing gale-force winds.[1] The JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm at 1800\u00a0UTC that day.[15] The remnants of Monica persisted for several more days, tracking near Darwin on 25 April before turning south-east and accelerating over the Northern Territory. The remnants eventually dissipated on 28 April over central Australia.[1]"

Ferry services in the Great Barrier Reef and flights in and out of the region were cancelled.[23] However, no evacuations took place according to the Emergency Management in Australia.[24] An aborigine community of 700, located around the mouth of the Lockhart River, were in the direct path of the storm. The chief executive officer of the community stated that they were ready for the storm, having suffered no losses from Cyclone Ingrid which impacted the same area in 2005.[25] Little damage was recorded in Queensland, despite Cyclone Monica being a Category 3 cyclone, as the storm impacted a sparsely populated region of the Cape York peninsula.[24] A storm surge of 1.23\u00a0m (4.0\u00a0ft) was recorded in Mossman and waves were recorded up to 4.24\u00a0m (13.9\u00a0ft) in Weipa.[26] Heavy rainfall was also associated with the storm, exceeding 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) near where Monica made landfall. Wind gusts up to 109\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) were recorded as the storm traversed the peninsula.[1] Officials reported about 15\u00a0percent of the structures along the Lockhart River sustained minor damage.[24] Minor coastal flooding was also reported due to Monica.[26] Three Torres Strait Islanders were rescued after 22\u00a0days drifting at sea in the wake of the cyclone passing through the Torres Strait, north of mainland Queensland.[27]"

A 10\u00a0pm curfew was also put in place to keep people off the streets during the night.[28] Local tours in the territory were postponed or cancelled due to the storm. Several flights in and out of Darwin were also cancelled, as was the Darwin Anzac Day march.[29][30] Alcan, the world's second-largest aluminium producer, warned customers of potential interruptions to supplies on contracts from its Gove refinery.[31] Rio Tinto's Ranger Uranium Mine ceased operations on 24 April, \"as a precautionary measure\".[32] At one point, Monica was forecast to pass directly over Goulburn Island. In response, officials evacuated the island's 337 residents to shelters set up in Pine Creek. Numerous schools in the threatened region, especially in Darwin, were closed ahead of Monica's arrival.[33] Several shelters were opened in Darwin early on 24 April in anticipation of an influx of evacuees. Stores throughout the area reported increased sales for storm supplies, with some reducing prices on specific items.[34] The same day, the Darwin Returned and Services League of Australia cancelled all ANZAC Day services and marches in Darwin that were to be held the next day, to ensure the safety of prospective participants.[35] The Wessel Islands, located off the coast of the region, suffered significant damage from the storm. Mangrove trees were uprooted throughout the islands and sand dunes were destroyed. An outstation located on one of the islands was destroyed by the cyclone.[36] The highest 24-hour rainfall from the storm was recorded near Darwin at 340\u00a0mm (13\u00a0in).[1] A storm total for the same area was recorded at 383\u00a0mm (15.1\u00a0in), surpassing the rainfall record for the entire month of April set in 1953.[37] Although the storm made landfall at peak intensity in Australia's Northern Territory, the impacted areas were sparsely populated. Around the region where Monica made landfall, evidence of a 5\u20136\u00a0m (16\u201320\u00a0ft) storm surge was present in Junction Bay.[24] Wind gusts up to 148\u00a0km/h (92\u00a0mph) felled power lines in Maningrida;[38] 12 homes sustained damage from fallen trees in Jabiru; and extensive damage was reported in Gunbalanya (formerly known as Oenpelli).[39] Roughly 1,000 people also lost phone service in the region.[33] Several highways were blocked by fallen trees throughout the area.[24] A resort in Jabiru sustained significant damage and was closed for two weeks following the storm.[29] Insured damages to the national parks amounted to A$1.6 million (US$766,000).[40] According to the Northern Territory Insurance Office, structural damage from Cyclone Monica amounted to A$5\u00a0million (US$4.4\u00a0million).[41] The remnants of Monica produced significant rainfall over parts of the Northern Territory several days after the system weakened below cyclone status. Flash flooding was reported throughout the Adelaide River basin as up to 261\u00a0mm (10.3\u00a0in) of rain fell in a 24-hour span.[1] On 26 April, the remnants of Monica spawned a small tornado near Channel Point; several mangrove trees were snapped and branches were thrown to nearby beaches.[42]"

A large-scale windthrow event affected approximately 10,400\u00a0km2 (4,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of forest, resulting in the damage or destruction of 140\u00a0million trees. Damage extended 60\u201370\u00a0km (37\u201343\u00a0mi) north and south of Monica's centre and progressed 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) inland. The affected areas primarily consist of Eucalyptus (namely E. miniata and E. tetrodonta) and Corymbia (namely C. dichromophloia, C. latifolia, and C. foelscheana) tree species. Common grasses in the savanna area include Triodia bitextura and Sorghum. Areas near the cyclone's landfall point\u2014Junction Bay\u2014also comprise wetlands and Melaleuca swamp forests. The heaviest damage occurred just east of the landfall point, with more than 85\u00a0percent of vegetation severely damaged; it spanned 139\u00a0km2 (54\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[43] In this area, trees were completely defoliated, snapped, and/or uprooted. Within 22\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) of Junction Bay, 77\u00a0percent of all trees were uprooted or snapped at the trunk, while 84\u00a0percent suffered total defoliation. In the Melaleuca swamps, 60\u00a0percent of trees were snapped or uprooted once wind gusts exceeded 144\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph).[38] Approximately 12.7\u00a0million tonnes of vegetative debris was created by the storm.[43] The Goomadeer River catchment, which flows into Junction Bay, was entirely denuded. The prolific loss of trees led to hydrologic changes in the region, with flood events likely becoming more severe as groundwater flow increased.[38] Farther southwest, the Magela Creek catchment in Kakadu National Park suffered a direct hit from the weakening cyclone. Gusts up to 135\u00a0km/h (84\u00a0mph) impacted the Ngarradj sub-catchment, destroying 42\u00a0percent of the tree canopy cover. Long-term losses in the sub-catchment reached 23\u00a0percent. Less rainfall than would normally be expected with such a storm lessened tree loss in the area, with soils largely not becoming saturated enough to allow trees to topple over.[44] The large amount of debris left behind contained approximately 51\u201360\u00a0million tonnes of greenhouse gases\u2014primarily carbon dioxide\u2014or roughly 10\u00a0percent of Australia's annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.[43][38] With Monica occurring just before the onset of the dry season, widespread brushfires were anticipated in the affected regions owing to the large amount of kindling. However, analysis of satellite imagery revealed only slightly above-average fire activity in the months following the cyclone.[43]"

To fully restore the South Alligator valley, environmentalists requested A$7.4\u00a0million (US$6.6\u00a0million) in funds.[45] In a study at Magela Creek a year after the storm, it was determined that between 8% and 19% of the tree canopy lost due to the storm had begun to recover.[44] Additional studies at the Gulungul Creek and the Alligator Rivers region revealed that suspended sediment values in flowing water had temporarily increased in the wake of Monica. The above-average values persisted for roughly a year before the streams returned to pre-cyclone sediment levels.[46] In a study of the Arnhem forests which were devastated by the cyclone, environmentalists reported that it would take over 100\u00a0years for the forest to recover. The storm's winds snapped numerous trees, estimated to have been over 200 years old and more than 60\u00a0cm (23.5\u00a0in) in diameter. It is estimated that it would take several hundred years before trees of similar sizes would flourish in the region.[47]"

Sepat underwent an explosive intensification on the night of August 13, reaching peak intensity at Category 5-equivalent super typhoon intensity the following morning. The storm maintained its strength for 2 days, until it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, just before he storm makes landfall in Taiwan on August 17 (+21:00 UTC) as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon. After crossing the Taiwanese strait, Sepat; already weakening into Category 1 status due to unfavorable conditions, made a second landfall in China on August 18, 2007. The storm persisted across Mainland China, as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August 20, and Sepat, now an extratropical low continued through the Chinese mainland until it finally dissipated near Yunnan Province on August 24. More than 43 deaths were directly blamed on Sepat; 3 out of the 43 were from the Philippines due to drowning brought on by heavy rains from the southwest monsoon enhanced by Sepat, with total insured losses estimated at $692 million (2007 USD), or $869.66 million (2020 USD; adjusted for inflation)."

        "content": "On August 11, a low-level circulation center formed in conjunction with a persistent area of convection about 1,280\u00a0km (800\u00a0mi) southeast of Naha, Okinawa. Northerly upper-level winds initially provided beneficial divergence, though also resulted in detrimental wind shear and lack of inflow.[1] Upper-level conditions gradually became more favorable for development as the disturbance tracked along the eastern periphery of an upper-level anticyclone. With convective rain bands wrapping into the circulation, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system late on August 11.[2] Remaining nearly stationary between ridges to its northeast and southwest, the system developed further, and early on August 12 the JTWC classified it as Tropical Depression 09W.[3] Shortly thereafter, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression while located about 1,245\u00a0km (774\u00a0mi) southeast of Okinawa.[4] Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm[5] based on Dvorak technique satellite intensity estimates and[6] the storm exhibiting tightly-curved convective bands. An upper-level low helped to reduce wind shear that had been affecting the storm.[6] The JTWC also warned of the possibility of rapid intensification.[6] The JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm later that day[7] and named it Sepat, a name contributed by Malaysia referring to a freshwater fish species.[8] By early the next morning, August 13, Sepat had a banding eye visible on microwave satellite imagery[9] and had remained in an environment conducive for strengthening, including weakening wind shear. An upper-level anticyclone also moved over the storm.[9] By now, Sepat had moved into PAGASA's area of responsibility and attained the local name \"Egay\". The JMA upgraded Sepat to a severe tropical storm shortly after.[10] Sepat continued to slowly gain more organisation and intensify further,[11] and started to move faster under the influence of a subtropical steering ridge.[11] Sepat strengthened into a typhoon on the morning of August 14[12][13] under still-decreasing wind shear and favourable diffluence.[14] Sepat developed a cloud-filled eye measuring 12 nautical miles (22\u00a0km; 14\u00a0mi) across by later that night, part of a larger central dense overcast nearly 130\u00a0nmi (240\u00a0km), 150\u00a0mi) wide.[15] Favourable sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F) allowed Sepat to continue intensifying despite decrease of poleward outflow.[15] By this time, Sepat had deepened to 955 hPa.[16] The JTWC also noted possible imminent rapid intensification of the storm.[15] Late that night, Sepat underwent rapid intensification as expected, and was upgraded by the JTWC to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon the next morning.[17] The JMA analysed Sepat at 940 hPa at the same time.[18] The deep convection warmed slightly and underwent slight fluctuations during the afternoon.[19] During this period, Sepat slowed in forward speed and took a turn from a west-southwest motion to a more poleward one.[20] Its eye also cleared out, became slightly larger, and warmed.[20] By late that night, Sepat had become the strongest storm of the season to date, with the JMA analyzing its central pressure at 925 hPa,[21] lower than Typhoon Man-yi's minimum of 935 hPa. Continuing to intensify,[22] Sepat reached a peak minimum central pressure of 910 hPa, as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon, on the morning of August 16.[23] Sepat managed to maintain its cloud-free eye.[22] High ocean heat content and good equatorward outflow allowed Sepat to maintain its intensity, but an eyewall replacement cycle began later that night.[24] The eyewall replacement cycle continued throughout the night, and by the next morning, Sepat displayed concentric eyewalls, with the inner eyewall being weaker.[25] The JTWC downgraded it to a typhoon later that evening.[26] It made landfall in eastern Taiwan between Taitung and Hualien on the morning of August 18 local time at around 5 a.m. (2100 UTC August 17)[27] and weakened to a minimal typhoon.[28] After crossing the island, Sepat held on to minimal typhoon intensity before weakening to a severe tropical storm that night.[citation needed] It made a second landfall, in China, about 24 hours after landfall on Taiwan and was downgraded to a tropical storm the next morning. It further weakened inland, and the JMA issued its final advisory on the morning of August 20, with the storm weakening into a remnant low shortly afterward. For the next several days, Sepat's remnants drifted westward and then southwestward, before dissipating near Yunnan Province on August 24."

The heat wave appeared due to an exceptionally strong ridge centered over the area, whose probability of formation was linked to the effects of climate change by multiple studies.[8][9] It resulted in some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in the region,[10] including the highest temperature ever measured in Canada at 49.6\u00a0\u00b0C (121.3\u00a0\u00b0F), as well as the highest temperatures in British Columbia, in the Northwest Territories, in the state of Washington as well as a tied record in Oregon. The record-high temperatures associated with the heat wave stretched from Oregon to northern Manitoba, and daily highs were set as far east as Labrador and as far southwest as Southern California. The extreme heat sparked numerous, extensive wildfires, some reaching hundreds of square kilometers in area. The eponymous Lytton wildfire destroyed the village of Lytton, British Columbia, the day after the city set the record high temperature for Canada. Extreme heat also damaged road and rail infrastructure, forced closures of businesses, disrupted cultural events, and melted snowcaps, in some cases resulting in flooding.[11] The heat wave also caused extensive damage to agriculture across the region, resulting in substantial loss of crop yield and the death of 651,000 farm animals.[12] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimated that the heatwave caused at least $8.9 billion (2021 USD) in damages in the USA.[4] The death toll exceeded 1,400 people, with at least 808 estimated in western Canada.[2] The Chief Coroner of British Columbia reported that 619 deaths were recorded due to heat exposure in the week from June\u00a025 to July 1.[13] Confirmed deaths in the United States include at least 116 in Oregon (of which 72\u00a0are in Multnomah County, which includes Portland),[14] at least 112 in Washington[15] and one death in Idaho;[16] An analysis by The New York Times suggests that around 600 excess deaths occurred the week the heat wave passed through Washington and Oregon.[3]"

        "content": "On June\u00a023, the United States National Weather Service warned of an approaching heat wave in the Pacific Northwest,[17] whose origins could be traced to torrential rains in China.[18] There, the warm, moist air rose and was eventually entrained by the jet stream, which transported it east over cooler waters. When that air current encountered an upper-level high-pressure zone, also called a ridge, it started to significantly deform, being forced to accommodate the high-pressure area south of the jet stream's meander.[19] At the same time, the Southwestern United States was enduring an intense drought [20] which caused higher-than-average temperatures, leading to a similar heat wave earlier in June.[21] The remnants of this heat wave then moved north to the Pacific Northwest.[22] Six days later, Environment Canada issued a heat warning for Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Manitoba, Yukon, and Northwest Territories.[23] These conditions made way for a massive Rex block.[21]  In this situation, a high-pressure area stays in place for an extended period and does not let cyclones pass through it, which otherwise could have cooled the region;[24] in this particular case, the high-pressure area was sandwiched between two stationary lows, which prevented the high-pressure region from moving.[28] As the Pacific Northwest experienced severe drought conditions, the already warm air heated more quickly than usual,[29] which intensified the ridge so strongly it caused a heat dome.[10] The downslope winds from the Cascades and other mountain ranges further warmed the air in the valleys.[27] After the heat dome hovered over British Columbia and the Northwestern United States for a few days, it began to move eastward, bringing relief to the Pacific coast but breaking records east of the Rocky Mountains, particularly in the northern parts of the Prairie provinces.[30] Sweltering conditions were observed as far east as Northwest Ontario.[31] By July\u00a04\u20135, the remnants of the heat dome crossed Hudson Bay and, weakened somewhat by the cool waters, entered Quebec,[32] and after that, Labrador,[33] briefly triggering temperatures of around 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F)."

Overall the strength of the heat dome was 86% greater than the same event would have been without background warming.[37]"

BC Hydro reported a peak of 8,500\u00a0MW, [126] while several electricity providers in Washington also logged record values.[127] It also prompted many power utilities in the area to formally ask to conserve energy.[128] The Idaho State Capitol voluntarily turned off lights as a result [129] and in the Spokane area, rolling power outages were used to reduce load on the grid.[127] Some residents chose to shelter from the heat by booking rooms in hotels, which often ran out of air-conditioned accommodation.[130] According to CoStar calculations, the search for cooled rooms made the hotel occupancy in British Columbia reach the highest levels since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,[131] while Washington County, Oregon (suburbs of Portland) hotels reported occupancy levels more than double the rate from 2020.[132]"

In response, Oregon's governor, Kate Brown, directed the agency to enforce the safety regulations for 180 days pending permanent implementation.[150] In Washington state, the heat wave prompted state agencies to roll out additional protections.[151] The Washington Post reported that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration was also considering a set of heat-related safety rules, whose implementation was said to be a \"top priority\" for the Biden administration.[152]"

        "content": "The heat event sparked significant fires across the West Coast and Western Canada.[42] One of the first fires to have struck the region was the Lava Fire, which eventually burned around 26,300 acres (106\u00a0km2) in the west of Mount Shasta, California.[170] Some of the largest fires, such as the Beckwourth Complex Fire, grew over 100,000 acres (405\u00a0km2). Strong winds, which were causing fire tornadoes in some places,[171] and dry vegetation hampered efforts to contain the fires. This led to road closures, such as the U.S. Route 97 and the North Cascades Highway,[172] suspension of airport operations in Redmond, Oregon, and evacuation of settlements adjacent to the fires.[173] The winds were so strong that residents of Medford, Oregon, c.\u00a080\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) north of the fires, reported having seen ash falling from the sky.[174] In British Columbia, 300 fires were ravaging the province, and the wildfire season destroyed around 2,230\u00a0km2 (860\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of forests by July\u00a015, 2021.[175] Pyrocumulonimbus clouds formed due to such extensive burning, producing several hundred thousand lightning strikes in one day and further complicating efforts to contain fires. [176] Among the most known fires was the Lytton fire, which started on June\u00a030 in British Columbia. The city of Lytton, which had beaten national heat records in the previous days, was ordered to be evacuated alongside several First Nations reserves. The town was eventually overrun by the fire, where it caused widespread destruction to the buildings.[56] A local MP, Brad Vis, estimated damage to the settlement at\u00a090%, while a local resident said that only \"four or five houses, the post office and the church were still standing\".[177] The fire damaged roads, telecommunication and power facilities as well as the railway that comes through the settlement;[178] and two people were killed sheltering from the flames.[179] The fire in the settlement forced the closure of a section of British Columbia Highway\u00a01, part of Trans-Canada Highway, as well as Highway\u00a012, which ends in Lytton.[180] Despite deployment of more than 17,000 firefighters by mid-July,[181] the size and number of the fires grew. Almost 1,000,000 acres (4,050\u00a0km2) of forest were consumed by large wildfires, and more than 2,250,000 acres (9,110\u00a0km2) were burnt in the United States as of July 15.[181] The intensity of the fires moved the US fire preparedness alert level to 5 (highest) by July 14, which was an early start of the wildfire season.[182] In addition to that, the Governors of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho declared states of emergency due to the extreme risk of wildfires.[183] The Canadian army officials set up a coordination center in Edmonton in order to assist wildfire actions in British Columbia, which would be directed until July\u00a019. [177] As the extreme heat and dry conditions persisted, scientists, firefighters and various politicians urged residents not to use fireworks during Independence Day celebrations in the Western United States[184] and on Canada Day in Alberta.[185] In addition to that, Washington and British Columbia enacted state-/provincewide bans on most open fires.[186] Other areas such as Idaho and Manitoba used more localized approaches to burn restrictions.[187] As of September 14, 2021, the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) reported that 44,647 wildfires in the United States had burned 5.6 million acres of land.[188] Similarly, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) announced that 6,317 wildfires burned 10.34 million acres.[189] Due to the earliness and severity of the wildfire season, the United States and Canada were unable to provide each other with aid to jointly combat fires. Initially, the NIFC declared that the United States and Canada had a preparedness level of 5, meaning it had the potential to exhaust firefighting resources.[190]  However, by September 20, 2021, the national preparedness level was reduced to 4 and 1 for the United States and Canada, respectively.[191] Prior to the start of the extreme heat wave, wildfire risk was greatly elevated by existing weather conditions. In April 2021, the North American wildfire season was predicted to be severe due to record drought conditions and high spring temperatures in the West.[192] In May, more than 75% of the western United States experienced drought conditions, with 21% of these conditions being deemed as \"exceptional drought\", which is the most extreme level of drought.[193] These extreme conditions result in a lack of moisture on the ground that is imperative for combating wildfires.[194]  In Arizona, there were 311 early wildfires in the first four months of the year, compared to 127 in the same period in 2020.[195] In July 2021, haze from West Coast fires resulted in air quality alerts in East Coast cities.[196] In Montana, evacuation orders had displaced around 600 people by early August.[197] On October 21, the national preparedness level was lowered to 1, while by November 5, a total of 48,725 wildfires had burned more than 6.5 million acres across the United States, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC).[191]"

Extensive melting occurred in the snowcaps of Banff National Park, which a glaciologist estimated that the Albertan snow from the mountains melted three times faster than usual.[198] On Mount Rainier, the heat wave caused the mass of the snow cap to shrink by 30%, and Washington's glaciers in general have come through what glaciologists say to be the strongest melting episode in 100 years. Additionally, the increased melting of glaciers caused high amounts of runoff to be present within some rivers.[199] The unexpected snowmelt resulted in extensive flash flooding down the creeks and rivers fed by the glaciers, triggering evacuation orders.[200]"

As a result, the Washington State Department of Health urged people not to eat raw oysters and other shellfish from the region.[204] On the land, trees in Metro Vancouver dried up and started shedding leaves;[205] the same happened to the fir canopy in Oregon on the side where the trees faced the sun.[206] In Seattle, nearly a hundred juvenile terns, whose nests were on top of an industrial building, died when they plunged to the pavement below, presumably trying to escape the heat - those that survived were treated for burns.[207] Scores of British Columbian raptors, apart from heat exhaustion, suffered from dehydration and starvation.[208]"

        "content": " Hurricane Ophelia was a long-lived tropical cyclone in September 2005 that moved along an erratic path off the East Coast of the United States for much of its existence. The fifteenth named storm and the eighth hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Ophelia originated from a complex set of systems across the Atlantic in early September. An area of low pressure consolidated near the Bahamas and was classified as Tropical Depression Sixteen on September\u00a06. Stuck in a region of meager steering currents, largely dominated by a lull between two ridges to the north and east, this system moved along a looping course with a general northward trajectory. The following day it organized into Tropical Storm Ophelia and soon reached hurricane status on September\u00a08. Over the next week, Ophelia's intensity oscillated between tropical storm and hurricane levels due to intrusions of dry air, varying levels of wind shear, and gradual upwelling of cooler waters along its meandering path. Gradually growing in size, the system reached hurricane strength for the fourth time and its peak strength on September\u00a014, with maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). By this time Ophelia had completed a second loop and was moving northwest toward North Carolina. Changing direction once again, the system turned away from the state though its eyewall scraped the coastline for two days. The system degraded to tropical storm strength for a final time on September\u00a016 as it began accelerating northeast. Becoming embedded within the westerlies, Ophelia transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day. Remaining on a steady east-northeast to northeast path for the next week, Ophelia traversed Atlantic Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean before dissipating on September\u00a023 over the Norwegian Sea. Ophelia's erratic track prompted warnings and watches for a large swath of the Eastern Seaboard, ultimately a greater area than necessary. With the storm occurring on the heels of Hurricane Katrina, state governments were quick to prepare shelters out of an abundance of caution. National Guard servicemen were deployed to North Carolina while thousands more were on standby there and in South Carolina. More than 2,000 people used public shelters as Ophelia approached land. As the hurricane's core remained largely offshore, its impacts were significantly less than feared. Some coastal locales saw heavy rain, notably more than 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The greatest impacts were felt in North Carolina, where more than 240,000 people lost power and more than 1,500 homes were damaged. Total monetary losses in the state were estimated at $70\u00a0million.[nb 1] Extensive beach erosion occurred due to the hurricane's prolonged effects. Tropical storm-force wind gusts and heavy rain caused minor damage in Florida, Massachusetts, and South Carolina. Rough seas led to one fatality in Florida and left another person missing in South Carolina while rain-slicked roads contributed to a fatal accident in North Carolina. Atlantic Canada saw negligible effects as Ophelia's remnants traversed the region; one person died after falling from his roof while preparing for the storm. In the storm's wake, 37 of North Carolina's counties were declared disaster areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided roughly $5.2\u00a0million in public assistance and the National Guard assisted with distribution of relief supplies."

        "content": "The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record at the time by numerous metrics, with 28 tropical or subtropical storms forming throughout the year. It also proved to be a ruinous year, with thousands of fatalities and more than $100\u00a0billion in damage.[1] Above-normal sea surface temperature anomalies, averaging 1.8\u00a0\u00b0F (1\u00a0\u00b0C) in the western tropical Atlantic and Caribbean Sea contributed to the development of these storms.[2] The Climate Prediction Center determined four primary factors driving the season's activity: the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, the reduction of atmospheric convection in the tropical Pacific, record-high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean, and conducive wind and pressure patterns across the western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.[3] Additionally, the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was in a neutral phase, lowering the likelihood of storms making landfall on the East Coast of the United States and leading to a concentration of impacts farther west.[4] September saw considerable activity, with five hurricanes developing.[5]"

        "header": "Origins",
        "content": "On September\u00a01, 2005, a cold front emerged off the East Coast of the United States and propagated southeast. The system became increasingly elongated into a trough over the following days, eventually extending from near the Florida Peninsula east to the edge of Tropical Depression Lee east of Bermuda. By September\u00a04, two defined areas of low pressure consolidated along the trough: one south of Bermuda that would later become Hurricane Nate and the second near the Bahamas which would become Hurricane Ophelia.[6] Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC)[nb 2] described the dual lows as a \"complex scenario\" and stated that possible tropical cyclogenesis would be slow to occur.[8] Initially drifting south, the latter system reversed course on September\u00a05 as convection organized around the low within an area of favorable upper-level conditions.[6][9] Based on satellite data and synoptic observations, the NHC estimated that Tropical Depression Sixteen formed around 06:00\u00a0UTC[nb 3] on September\u00a06 between Andros and Grand Bahama.[6] Winds at Freeport and Settlement Point reached 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h).[11] Situated within a region of weak steering currents, the depression drifted generally north and later north-northwest, crossing Grand Bahama around 16:00\u00a0UTC.[6] Wind shear displaced convection north of the broad center as it traversed the northern Bahamas.[12] Initially, the system consisted of three defined mesoscale convective systems (MCS) spanning an area 120\u00a0mi (200\u00a0km) across, each producing areas of heavy rain. Throughout September\u00a06, the MCSs congealed into a single spiral rainband and the precursor to an eyewall.[13]"

        "header": "Fluctuation in strength and track",
        "content": "Early in the storm's lifecycle, meteorologists struggled with a complex track forecast as models depicted a wide-range of scenarios for the depression.[14] Some models took the system into the Gulf of Mexico and others kept the system off the coast of the Southeastern United States.[15][14] The cyclone was stuck between two lobes of the subtropical ridge to the north as a strong trough moved off the eastern United States.[15] The system became more organized on September\u00a07 and intensified into Tropical Storm Ophelia approximately 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) east-southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.[6] This marked the earliest formation of a season's fifteenth named storm. This record was later tied by Hurricane Nate in 2011 and subsequently broken by Tropical Storm Omar on September\u00a01, 2020.[16] Becoming embedded within a broad trough extending from Florida, through Ophelia and Nate, and all the way east to Hurricane Maria over the central Atlantic, Ophelia executed a slow counter-clockwise loop. During this time it steadily intensified as banding features coalesced around the storm.[6][17] High sea surface temperatures of 84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C) fueled bursts of deep convection throughout September\u00a08. Following the formation of an eyewall and well-defined upper-level outflow,[18][19][20] Ophelia intensified into a hurricane around 21:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08 with sustained winds reaching 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[6][20] The hurricane's prolonged lack of movement resulted in the upwelling of cooler waters which in turn caused it to weaken back to a tropical storm early on September\u00a09.[6][21] Later on September\u00a09, Ophelia began moving slowly northeast in response to a mid-latitude trough.[22] The storm soon developed a 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) wide eye and regained hurricane status around 18:00\u00a0UTC.[23][24] Soon thereafter, increasing wind shear and intrusions of dry air into the hurricane's core caused degradation of its structure.[25] However, Ophelia's structure once again improved late on September\u00a010 with a 35\u00a0mi (55\u00a0km) wide eye developing;[26] this coincided with it regaining hurricane status for the third time.[6] Concurrently, it attained its lowest central pressure of 976\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.82\u00a0inHg).[23] Over the next two days the hurricane executed a clockwise loop within an area of weak steering between two ridges. Its slow movement led to further upwelling of cooler waters even over the relatively warm Gulf Stream.[6][27] Gradual degradation of the hurricane's structure occurred as it looped back to the west-southwest, with meager convection unable to maintain vertical mixing.[28] Sea surface temperatures beneath the system had plummeted to an average of 74.3\u00a0\u00b0F (23.5\u00a0\u00b0C) by this time,[29] and with insufficient heat content convection within the eyewall collapsed. Slightly warmer waters farther from the center helped support a broken ring around the decaying center.[30] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, Ophelia weakened back to a tropical storm for the third time.[23] An unusual eyewall replacement cycle commenced with its inner core dissipating and a larger eye organizing around it; its radius of maximum wind doubled from about 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) to 60\u00a0mi (100\u00a0km). This differed from classical replacement cycles as Ophelia never displayed defined concentric eyewalls, rather the inner one degraded as the outer one formed.[30] After completing the two-day-long loop, the storm proceeded along a slow northwest and later northward trajectory toward the Carolinas.[31]"

        "content": "After remaining largely steady-state from September\u00a012 into the early part of September\u00a013,[32] convection became increasingly organized as it moved back over the Gulf Stream.[33] Maintaining a broad circulation, the storm's smaller core rotated erratically within it while the overall system progressed steadily north.[34] Ophelia regained hurricane strength for a fourth and final time early on September\u00a014.[32] The system displayed an increasingly organized eye once again and expansive outflow aloft. The ridge previously halting the hurricane's northward motion began accelerating off the New England coastline; however, westerly flow in its wake would not be strong enough to induce significant acceleration of Ophelia. Accordingly the hurricane began an \"excruciatingly long passage\" along the shores of North Carolina.[35] Throughout September\u00a014, the storm's eye expanded to a diameter of 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km).[36] A more defined inner eyewall featured small vortices which enhanced the vertical mixing of winds.[37] Around 12:00\u00a0UTC it attained maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), the highest during its existence.[23] Over the next two days, the hurricane's eyewall scraped the North Carolina coastline bringing hurricane-force winds to these areas. A station at Cape Lookout measured a peak two-minute sustained wind of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) while an unverified gust of 104\u00a0mph (167\u00a0km/h) was reported in Davis.[38] Ophelia once again became caught between two ridges on September\u00a015 as it turned east.[39] Over a two-day period, Ophelia's eyewall impacted areas from Wilmington to Morehead City.[32] The combination of dry air coming from land and cooler shelf waters caused convection on the hurricane's west side to collapse; its proximity to the Gulf Stream enabled it to maintain convection elsewhere in its circulation.[39] Ophelia pulled away from North Carolina early on September\u00a016 as it weakened to a tropical storm for the final time.[32] The storm accelerated east late on September\u00a016 as it became embedded within the mid-latitude westerlies.[40] An approaching baroclinic wave over the Great Lakes also induced a northward component to Ophelia's track.[41] Increasing shear displaced convection north of its center and caused its core to become vertically tilted.[40] After a brief resurgence in convection,[42] Ophelia began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a017 as it interacted with an approaching trough. Its surface center became increasingly separated from the strongest winds and thunderstorm activity.[43] During this time the storm made its closest approach to Massachusetts, passing 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) to the southeast of Cape Cod.[32] Ophelia completed its extratropical transition by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018 as it approached Nova Scotia.[32][23] The system remained just offshore, with its center scraping the coast of Guysborough County in the eastern portion of the island. It then traversed the Cabot Strait before making landfall in south-central Newfoundland around 18:00\u00a0UTC with maximum winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h).[23][41] Ophelia traversed the island within six hours, emerging over the north Atlantic Ocean by September\u00a019.[23][32] The cyclone continued along an east-northeast to northeast path for several days as it spun down. Ophelia ultimately dissipated on September\u00a023 over the Norwegian Sea.[32]"

This was the first such mission conducted into a tropical cyclone. Flying at an altitude of 2,500\u00a0ft (760\u00a0m), the vehicle measured peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). A concurrent NOAA Hurricane Hunter mission corroborated the vehicle's measurements, and the project was considered a success.[47] This was followed two weeks later by the first successful Aerosonde core penetration of a tropical cyclone within Typhoon Longwang near Taiwan.[48] The final research mission into Ophelia was conducted on September\u00a017, focusing on its extratropical transition. A collaborative effort between NOAA and Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service, two recon missions were flown into the storm to study structural changes during this transitory period.

With an uncertain track, the main issue presented was beach erosion, especially in areas significantly affected by Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004.[53] Ophelia was the first major beach erosion event to test the $30\u00a0million shoreline restoration in Brevard County.[54] A public shelter was opened in Daytona Beach, Volusia County; only 13 people used the shelter and were relocated to a Red Cross facility. Schools in the county were closed on September\u00a08 over flooding concerns. Fourteen ships departed Naval Station Mayport to avoid the storm.[53] Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission search and rescue teams previously sent to Mississippi returned to the state. Mariners as far west as Tallahassee were advised of possible adverse conditions.[55] Shipment of the Space Shuttle external tank to NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center was delayed in order to protect the equipment. The tank was originally meant to be delivered to a facility in New Orleans but that structure was closed indefinitely due to damage from Hurricane Katrina.[56][57] Concerns over flooding were raised in Polk County with areas already heavily saturated ahead of the storm. Pumping of water into Lake Rosalie was authorized by the South Florida Water Management District, but the pumps were unlikely to arrive in time. Similarly, water levels at Lake Griffin, Rock Lake, and Lake Irish in Seminole County were elevated and posed a flood risk.[58]"

        "content": "The South Carolina Emergency Management Division advised residents in flood-prone areas to remain abreast of the storm.[59] Forecasts on September\u00a010 indicated Ophelia would strike South Carolina and local emergency management officials held meetings to discuss preparations.[60] Governor Mark Sanford requested the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) suspend transport of Katrina refugees to the receiving centers in Charleston and Colombia. Any potential evacuees from Ophelia would be directed to hotels in the Midlands.[61] Although 1,650 members of the South Carolina National Guard were already deployed on anti-terror missions and Katrina-related relief, 7,100 remained in reserve if needed.[62] Eighty-five state troopers were deployed to coastal areas to assist local police.[63] The Red Cross opened shelters on September\u00a010 in the Lowcountry, but closed them the following day due to lack of use.[64] Charleston County also opened public shelters before the issuance of any evacuation orders.[65] Voluntary evacuation orders were issued for barrier islands, coastal residents, those living in mobile homes, and people living in flood-prone areas of Horry and Georgetown counties on September\u00a013.[66] The Red Cross opened three shelters across both counties; only 25\u00a0people used them.[67] Statewide, approximately 2,000 people sought refuge across 45 shelters.[68] Horry County officials revised evacuation procedures in light of the large loss of life from Katrina in the Gulf Coast, with emphasis placed on relocating poor, sick, and elderly persons.[69] Schools in Georgetown and Horry counties closed while Coastal Carolina University and Horry-Georgetown Technical College suspended classes.[70] Football and volleyball matches between Charleston Southern University and The Citadel on September\u00a012 were postponed.[71] The Cougar Classic golf tournament at Yeamans Hall Club teed off early due to the storm.[72] North Carolina Governor Mike Easley declared a state of emergency on September\u00a010.[65] Flood concerns were high along Pamlico Sound and the Neuse River where a storm surge of 6 to 11\u00a0ft (1.8 to 3.4\u00a0m) was forecast. Low-lying areas along the Neuse River in particular were severely impacted by Hurricane Isabel in 2003.[73] Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for the approximately 800 tourists on Ocracoke Island on September\u00a011.[74][75] The decision was made at least partly in response to the effects of Hurricane Alex the previous year. Communities elsewhere in the state were uncertain whether or not to issue evacuation orders.[76] Mandatory evacuations were issued for six counties, including Hatteras Island, while eight others had voluntary orders in place by September\u00a014.[77] Sixty shelters were opened statewide.[78] At least 95\u00a0people used public shelters in Wilmington.[79] Evacuations were ordered for a 20-block area of Washington that had flooded during Hurricane Fran in 1996.[73] Ferry service across the Pamlico Sound was suspended on September\u00a012 due to high seas.[80] Both of the state's major ports were shut down.[81] Schools were closed across five counties on September\u00a013.[82] Classes were suspended at the University of North Carolina Wilmington and East Carolina University.[77] The North Carolina National Guard deployed 300 troops to staging centers in eastern areas of the state. The National Guard was supplemented by 460\u00a0highway patrol officers, swift-water and urban search and rescue teams, and seven helicopters.[82][83] Two warehouses stocked with two days-worth of food for 10,000 people were readied.[80] FEMA deployed 250\u00a0personnel, a larger-than-normal response for a storm of Ophelia's intensity in light of the damage caused by Katrina.[73] Progress Energy mobilized at least 900\u00a0people to restore power, including 600 supplementary personnel.[84] Linemen originally sent to the Gulf Coast were recalled to the state and 140 additional workers from South Carolina Electric & Gas Company were provided.[77][85] The United States Department of Energy deployed personnel to assist local services. The Brunswick Nuclear Generating Station declared an \"unusual event\" as a precautionary measure.[86]"

Concern was raised for the possibility of flooding along Chesapeake Bay.[88] Campgrounds throughout Cape Cod were shut down for the duration of the storm. Food and water were provided to 200 people who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina and living at Camp Edwards. Counselors were provided to assist anyone stressed from experiencing another storm.[89] In Chatham, Massachusetts, fishermen moved their boats to safety while the local harbormaster ensured docked vessels were properly secured.[90]"

Debris from Juan remained scattered across Nova Scotia two years after the storm.[91] The CHC initially forecast hurricane-force winds to impact parts of Nova Scotia, but later tempered expectations as Ophelia weakened on approach.[92] The Halifax Daily News described city residents as \"surprisingly complacent\", with media broadcasts \"[not] \u00a0...hyped up at all\".[93] Expected rainfall from the storm led to Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources ending a fire ban for western areas of the province on September\u00a015.[94] Nova Scotia Power, criticized for its poor response after Juan, placed hundreds of workers on standby and requested additional personnel from other provinces.[95][96] Ahead of the storm's arrival, the Emergency Management Offices of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador Emergency Measures advised residents to take appropriate precautions to protect themselves and property. They highlighted the recent devastation wrought by Katrina in the United States and damaging events in Atlantic Canada over the past several years.[97][98] Residents across the region secured boats and stocked up on supplies.[99]"

There, breaking waves of 6 to 8\u00a0ft (1.8 to 2.4\u00a0m) caused moderate beach erosion. Water reached the banks of a canal in Palm Coast, with occasional splashes over the top on September\u00a09.[101] A portion of State Road A1A was undermined by erosion and closed near Flagler Beach.[102] The Florida Department of Transportation used  dump trucks to shore up the road with large rocks.[103] On September\u00a011, a father and daughter were pulled out to sea off Duval County; they were later rescued.[102] Squall lines associated with the storm produced locally heavy rain and strong winds, with a storm spotter in Duval estimating winds of 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). Minor street flooding occurred in a poor drainage area within Jacksonville.[104] A peak storm surge of 3.03\u00a0ft (0.92\u00a0m) was measured in Mayport.[105] A small area along the east-central coast experienced tropical storm-force winds, with a NASA station in Cape Canaveral reporting sustained winds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) and a gust to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[38] On September\u00a012, the body of a man was found in Palm Beach Shores near an empty boat; his death is presumed to be the result of rough seas produced by Ophelia.[106] The entire east coast saw at least 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) of rain, with accumulations exceeding 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) in northeastern coastal counties.[107] Accumulations were greatest in Flagler County where three-day rainfall totals reached 15.2\u00a0in (390\u00a0mm) in Palm Coast;[108] this was the highest total from Ophelia in the state.[109] Secondary roads saw up to 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of standing water in poor drainage areas in the city.[108] The collective effects of Ophelia and six other tropical cyclones that impacted Florida in 2005 led to the addition of 20.2\u00a0mi (32.5\u00a0km) of critically eroded beaches and 0.2\u00a0mi (0.32\u00a0km) of critically eroded inlet shorelines.[110] In South Florida, temperatures rose 3\u20135\u00a0\u00b0F (1.7\u20132.8\u00a0\u00b0C) above normal.[111] Effects from Ophelia in Georgia were limited to the immediate coastline, with these areas largely receiving 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) of rain at most. Accumulations peaked at 3.15\u00a0in (80\u00a0mm) on Sapelo Island.[107][112] Sustained winds at St. Simons reached 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) while a minor storm surge of 1.87\u00a0ft (0.57\u00a0m) was observed at the Fort Pulaski National Monument.[113] The National Centers for Environmental Information received no reports of significant damage in the state.[114] In South Carolina, persistent onshore flow beginning on September\u00a07 caused significant erosion at Hunting Island State Park. The outer bands of the hurricane impacted extreme eastern portions of the state (primarily Charleston, Georgetown, and Horry counties) on September\u00a013 to 14. Several towns and cities experienced tropical storm-force wind gusts,[115] with gusts peaking at 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) at the Ben Sawyer Bridge. On the mainland, gusts reached 49\u00a0mph (79\u00a0km/h) at the Arthur Ravenel Bridge and 44\u00a0mph (71\u00a0km/h) in Charleston, Folly Beach, Myrtle Beach.[116][117] The winds downed trees in McClellanville and Mount Pleasant,[115] and some power outages were reported.[118] Heavy rainfall was concentrated along the state border with North Carolina; accumulations peaked at 6.3\u00a0in (160\u00a0mm) in North Myrtle Beach.[107][116] A peak storm surge of 2.81\u00a0ft (0.86\u00a0m) was observed in Springmaid Beach.[116] Coastal areas saw minor beach erosion.[115] Overall damage was limited across the state.[118] A teenage surfer went missing about 200\u00a0yd (180\u00a0m) off the coast of Folly Beach. Rescue operations for the surfer were suspended on September\u00a014 due to continued rough seas.[70]"

        "content": "Meandering along the coastline for three days, Ophelia was a prolonged rain and wind event for North Carolina. Despite its long duration, damage from the hurricane was less than anticipated.[119][120] An initial insured damage estimate of $800\u00a0million, yielding an approximate $1.6\u00a0billion in total damage, was given soon after the storm. However, later assessments by the American Insurance Services Group gave an insured loss estimate of $35\u00a0million, yielding a total cost of $70\u00a0million.[121] The National Centers for Environmental Information tabulated damage at $62\u00a0million.[122] The state's agriculture industry suffered approximately $19.6\u00a0million in damage.[123] Annual beach nourishment projects are credited with reducing the severity of damage from the hurricane.[124] One indirect fatality was linked to the hurricane when a car hydroplaned on a rain-slicked road in Franklin County.[125] East Carolina University political scientist Carmine Scavo indicated that as a reactionary response to Katrina, the state was \"possibly overprepared\" for the hurricane.[126] At the storm's peak on September\u00a014 to 15, over 240,000 customers were without power.[68] By September\u00a016, only 5,700 homes remained without power.[127] The hurricane's eyewall battered coastal areas from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras for up to 36\u00a0hours from September\u00a014 to 15. Hurricane-force wind gusts with near-hurricane-force sustained winds occurred in these areas.[119] A peak two-minute sustained wind of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a gust to 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h) was observed at Cape Lookout.[38] A gust to 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) was observed on Cedar Island.[119] A six-minute sustained wind of 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) and gust to 79\u00a0mph (127\u00a0km/h) was observed in Wrightsville Beach. Additionally, there was an unverified measurement of a gust to 103\u00a0mph (166\u00a0km/h) in Davis.[38][119]  Tropical storm-force wind gusts extended as far as 100\u00a0mi (155\u00a0km) inland.[119] Offshore, the ship Sanmar (callsign V2EX) measured sustained winds of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) about 85\u00a0mi (140\u00a0km) east-southeast of Morehead City.[38][128] Persistent onshore flow resulted in the entire coastline experiencing a storm surge of at least 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m).[119] Surge was greatest along the interior Pamlico Sound, especially along the lower reaches of the Newport, Neuse, and Pamlico Rivers;[38] however, the peak coincided with low tide.[129] A peak surge of 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) occurred along Clubfoot Creek.[119] The displacement of water left parts of the Sound's seafloor exposed.[130] Ocean-facing coastlines of Carteret and Onslow Counties saw surges of 4 to 6\u00a0ft (1.2 to 1.8\u00a0m).[38] Near Atlantic Beach, two cannons, an anchor, and other debris from the Queen Anne's Revenge were uncovered by churning waters.[131] Heavy rain accompanied the storm's three-day impact, with the greatest totals occurring along the immediate coastline.[38] Peak accumulations were concentrated in Brunswick County, reaching a maxima of 17.5\u00a0in (440\u00a0mm) at the Oak Island water treatment plant.[38][129] Accumulations as much as 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) extended northward to Oracoke Island.[119] Trace amounts of rain fell across half the state.[129] Heavy rainfall across Brunswick County caused widespread flooding. At least 200 homes were damaged on Bald Head Island and floodwaters briefly isolated 15 houses during the storm. Floodwaters reached a depth of 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) in some locations, rendering roads impassable.[129] A 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) section of coastal road was washed away in Ocean Isle.[73] Wind damage was confined to eastern areas of the county and consisted of minimal structural damage and downed trees.[129] Damage across Carteret County was primarily concentrated in coastal communities and barrier islands.[119] Numerous docks and piers were damaged or destroyed.[132] About 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) of the 1,000\u00a0ft (300\u00a0m) long Bogue Inlet Pier was destroyed.[133] Six homes were destroyed and 120 others were damaged in Salter Path. In Emerald Isle, 25 people required rescue.[134] The county's beaches lost a total of 1,427,388\u00a0cubic yards (1,091,316 cubic meters) of sand, with Emerald Isle accounting for about one-third of this.[135] Wind gusts up to 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) in New Hanover County prompted officials to suspend emergency patrols; however, police and firefighters remained on-call.[73] Damage across the county reached $4.9\u00a0million, with barrier islands suffering the brunt of damage. A total of 636 structures sustained varying degrees of damage with wind being the primary cause.[136] Coastal erosion was extensive, with Carolina Beach, Kure Beach, and Wrightsville Beach losing 25 to 80\u00a0percent of their beaches extending into the primary protective dunes. Septic tanks were exposed in some areas.[129] At least 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of water covered a main road in Carolina Beach.[79] A fishing vessel was stranded about 175\u00a0mi (275\u00a0km) off Wrightsville Beach amid 35\u00a0ft (11\u00a0m) seas and gusts to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) after being struck by lightning.[137] A force main in the Hewletts Creek watershed burst due to an influx of water from the hurricane, resulting in a 750,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal (2,800,000\u00a0L) spill.[138] Damage across Pender County reached $1.5\u00a0million, and was primarily concentrated in Surf City and on Topsail Island. Hurricane-force wind gusts caused minor damage to about 500\u00a0homes. Salt water flooding occurred along the backside of Topsail Island as water levels in the adjacent sound rose.[129] Some areas of Topsail Island lost 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m) of beach and were gouged up to 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) vertically. Eight duplexes were undermined by the erosion, potentially rendering them uninhabitable.[139] On the mainland of Pender County, damage was relatively light, limited to some downed trees and minor flooding.[129] A total of 388\u00a0homes were damaged across Onslow County, five of which were condemned.[136] The Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune suffered $1.2\u00a0million in damage, with the majority coming from the 300\u00a0ft (91\u00a0m) Riseley Pier.[140] About 150\u00a0ft (46\u00a0m) of the pier was destroyed, and sand surrounding the support pillars was eroded to the point where the remaining structure was unstable. The pier was condemned in October and eventually slated for demolition in February\u00a02010.[141] Minor wind damage occurred in parts of Craven, Duplin, Jones, and Lenoir counties.[142] Persistent northeasterly flow caused flooding in low-lying areas of New Bern by September\u00a012.[137] Inland counties, including Columbus, Duplin, and Samson, primarily suffered agricultural damage. Little damage occurred in Dare County, with preliminary losses reaching only $19,500.[136]"

On September\u00a016, water levels in Cape May reached 6.98\u00a0ft (2.13\u00a0m) above the mean lower water level.[143] From September\u00a015 to 17, moisture brought north from Ophelia interacted with a cold front, leading to widespread heavy rain in the Northeast. In Essex County, New Jersey, flash floods of roadways prompted water rescues. In Irvington, a local creek rose rapidly and inundated the Garden State Parkway with 3 to 4\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) of water.[144] Several streets in Suffolk County, New York, became impassible from swiftly moving water.[145] In Upstate New York, heavy rain fell across the Adirondacks on September\u00a016 to 17, leading to localized flash floods.[146] Scattered thunderstorms, some severe, elsewhere in the state downed trees and power lines.[145] Rainfall directly associated with Ophelia's passage in New Jersey and New York reached 2.4\u00a0in (61\u00a0mm) and 1.8\u00a0in (46\u00a0mm), respectively.[147] Flash floods occurred in Fairfield and New London counties in Connecticut.[148] Rainfall directly associated with Ophelia reached 2.57\u00a0in (65\u00a0mm) in Stafford Springs.[149] Ophelia brought locally heavy rain and gusty winds to southeastern Massachusetts as it brushed the state late on September\u00a016. Wind gusts on Nantucket reached 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) while rainfall peaked at 3.62\u00a0in (92\u00a0mm) in Falmouth.[89][149] Offshore, waves reached 19\u00a0ft (5.8\u00a0m) high.[89] Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Virginia received minimal rainfall with state accumulations peaking at 1.5\u00a0in (38\u00a0mm), 0.89\u00a0in (23\u00a0mm), 1.84\u00a0in (47\u00a0mm), 0.6\u00a0in (15\u00a0mm), and 0.88\u00a0in (22\u00a0mm) respectively.[149][150] Meteorologist Ted McIldoon at the CHC described Ophelia as a \"typical storm for [Atlantic Canada].\" Heavy rain affected much of Nova Scotia while the strongest winds remained offshore.[151] Winds in the province peaked at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on Beaver Island.[152] Only one power outage occurred, affecting 130 residents in Stewiacke.[151] One person died after slipping off a ladder while checking his roof for leaks.[121][151] Much of Nova Scotia received 1 to 2\u00a0in (25 to 50\u00a0mm) of rain, with a swath of 2 to 3\u00a0in (50 to 70\u00a0mm) across the center of the province.[151][153] A peak of 3.46\u00a0in (87.9\u00a0mm) was measured on Cape Sable Island. In Newfoundland, over 2.0\u00a0in (50\u00a0mm) of rain fell over parts of the eastern region of the province. Farther west, portions of New Brunswick received up to 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) of rain.[153]"

South Carolina Governor Sanford signed an executive order providing members of their state's National Guard, and personnel and equipment from their Emergency Management Department.[154] On September\u00a016, FEMA and state disaster estimators sent out four teams to ascertain the scope of Ophelia's effects. President George W. Bush declared 37\u00a0counties disaster areas where damage was reported.[127][155] Governor Easley requested government assistance on September\u00a022 as cleanup costs and damage to public utilities exceeded $16.5\u00a0million.[156] He later wrote a letter to President Bush on September\u00a026 formally asking for assistance in Carteret, Craven, Hyde, Jones, Pamlico, and Onslow Counties.[157] President Bush signed this request October\u00a07, designating ten counties (the requested six plus Brunswick, Dare, New Hanover, and Pender Counties) as major disaster areas.[158] FEMA ultimately provided $5,201,233.40 in public assistance to the designated counties.[159] Of the 300 National Guard troops initially deployed in the state, 180 were relieved from duty shortly after the hurricane's passage. The remaining soldiers distributed relief supplies and aided local emergency personnel.[82][127] The Salvation Army provided meals to 175\u00a0people in Morehead City.[160] Band Together, a nonprofit organization, held a disaster relief show for victims of Katrina and Ophelia on September\u00a021; benefits went to the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina.[161] Construction companies in Carteret County were overwhelmed with requests to repair docks and piers in the month following Ophelia.[132] North Carolina Senate President Marc Basnight and North Carolina House Speaker James B. Black suggested building codes be reformed for all structures to have windows resistant to 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h) winds.[160] Basnight emphasized that \"the kind of building that goes on the coast has to change\u00a0... [they] are catching damage each and every time.\"[162] With funding from FEMA, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) restored 11\u00a0mi (18\u00a0km) of beaches along Emerald Isle, Indian Beach, and Pine Knoll Shores, North Carolina, between January\u00a010 and March\u00a029, 2007.[163][164] In total, 1,229,836 cubic yards (940,277 cubic meters) of sand was distributed at a cost of $13,773,768.[165] The USCAE conducted additional nourishment projects around Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[166] Ecological effects from the hurricane were largely minor. The influx of brackish water into the Emily and Richardson Preyer Buckridge Coastal Reserve negatively impacted the health of local Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic white cedar) trees.[167] The draining of swamp water into Beard Creek dropped dissolved oxygen levels and caused a significant fish kill event with an estimated 28,500 fish dying.[168] A 2008 study on the effects of Ophelia and Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006 noted a significant increase in Vibrio spp. populations in relation to their passage.[169] Ecological biochemistry composition along the Neuse River estuary saw little disturbance; however, disruption to ferry services limited the sample frequency during data collection.[170]"

State irrigation minister said that in some districts of south Bengal, there had been around 400\u00a0mm rainfall during the last three days. The rivers Silabati in West Midnapore, Dwarkeswar in Bankura, Dwaraka and Kuye in Birbhum were flowing above the danger level. Some villages at Suri block II got flooded due to incessant rain. Some parts of the Hooghly and West Midnapore, including Ghatal, Khirpai, Chandrakona went under water since Saturday night. Bankura recorded the state's highest rainfall at 274\u00a0mm during the same period, while Digha recorded 104\u00a0mm, Halisahar recorded 189\u00a0mm and Burdwan received 72.6\u00a0mm of rains.[4] The water discharge from DVC dams was in excess of that in 1978 which saw an unprecedented flood in the state. So far 2.78 lakh (278\u00a0thousand) cusecs of water had been discharged by DVC as of 1 August. The situation in Bengal got worse on Thursday after Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) released more water from its dams and sounded a red alert in the lower catchment areas of the Damodar river. An additional 249,450 cusecs[5] of water was released from Durgapur barrage on Thursday morning. As a result, more areas in east Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah were hit by flood.[5] The flood affected districts had received record rainfall from 20 to 25 July. Compared to the normal rainfall received in July, Bankura received 754 per cent, Burdwan 334 per cent, Birbhum 313 per cent, East Midnapore 500 per cent, West Midnapore 424 per cent, Howrah 427 per cent, Hooghly 359 per cent, Kolkata 367 per cent, Murshidabad 174 per cent, and Purulia 721 per cent more rainfall. The cumulative rainfall received in Birbhum from 20 to 26 July was over 600\u00a0mm. From the weather system, the capital city of Kolkata received 142\u00a0mm of rain in 48 hours. July 2017 was the second wettest in Kolkata since 2008 with rain count 72% above the normal mark \u2013 the city received 621.5\u00a0mm rain. Only once \u2013 in 2015 \u2013 in the last decade has Kolkata received more rain in July from Cyclone Komen.[6]"

State government officials said the Subarnarekha river burst its banks after water was released from the Galudi dam in Jharkhand. Water was also released from Tilpara barrage in Birbhum. As a result, the Mayurakshi river inundated hundreds of acres of farmland. Water was reported to be rising fast in Chandrabhaga, Kopai and Bakreswar rivers in Birbhum district. In Hooghly district, embankments along the Darakeswar river were washed away and flood water gushed towards Arambagh town. In the 14 flood-hit districts in West Bengal, 27 lakh (2.7\u00a0million) people had been affected by flood. The government had set up 311 relief camps where over 47,000 people have taken shelter, adding it has also set up 131 medical camps.

These heat waves were the deadliest meteorological events in 2022. The highest temperature recorded was 47.0\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C (116.6\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0F) in Pinh\u00c3\u00a3o, Portugal, on 14 July.[3] In June 2022, temperatures of 40\u00e2\u20ac\u201c43\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C (104\u00e2\u20ac\u201c109\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0F) were recorded in parts of Europe, with most severe temperature anomalies in France, where several records were broken.[4][5] A second more severe heatwave occurred in mid-July, extending north to the United Kingdom where temperatures surpassing 40\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0F) were recorded for the first time.[6] The heatwaves were part of climate change in Europe.[7][8][9] A third heatwave began in August with parts of France and Spain expected to reach temperatures as high as 38\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0F). A prolonged hot period also hit the United Kingdom.[10] Although temperatures in most places in Europe subsided in August, a smaller heatwave impacted France on 12 September, with temperatures reaching 40.1\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C (104.2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0F).[11] As a result of the heatwaves, widespread droughts occurred across the continent.[12] Eurostat reported that the European Union saw 53,000 excess deaths in July, some of which may have occurred because of the heat wave. The excess death rate was several times higher than in July 2020 or July 2021, a statistic notable due to the COVID-19 pandemic having taken place in Europe during those years. The worst increases were seen in Spain and Cyprus.[13]"

In July 2023, researchers from Barcelona Institute for Global Health estimated 61,672 heat-induced problems between 30 May and 4 September in a finding published in Nature Medical.[34][35] The study gathered data from 35 countries with a combined population of 543 million people. A statistical framework was paired against historical meteorological records to observe the trend of deaths. The researchers said that they used weekly mortality data to develop their model which may not allow for short-term changes and hence may underestimate the actual number of deaths. Countries around the Mediterranean Sea, especially Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, experienced higher death rates.[36] In November 2022, Reuters stated that there were 20,000 \"excess\" deaths recorded; deaths which officials did not directly attribute to heat but may be heat-induced.[37] In November 2023, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health revised their number to over 70,000 \"excess\" deaths after developing a new method to calculate the mortality rate. The new research utilised daily temperature and mortality data as opposed to the previous research method using weekly data. The researchers claimed the previous figure underestimated the true number by 10.28 percent.[38]"

The agency issued special notice number 3/2022 with information about the phenomenon and initiated a national plan of preventive actions with a level-assignment map.[148] On 14 June, the heatwave spread to the south of Galicia and the interior of the Cantabrian Sea. Tropical nights also continued, with temperatures that did not fall below 20\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0F) in many provinces; in Ja\u00c3\u00a9n, a minimum of 27\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0F) was expected. It was predicted that the peak of the heatwave would be reached on Friday, 17 June, with the possibility of record-breaking temperatures in Zaragoza, Lleida and C\u00c3\u00b3rdoba.[151] The only points in Spain that were not affected are Asturias, the Canary Islands and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla.[152] In its daily statement, AEMET predicted the end of the weather episode for 18 June, with hot African air causing instability and a drop in temperatures.[153] Rub\u00c3\u00a9n del Campo of AEMET stated that it was the \"most intense heatwave for mid-June of, at least, the last 20 years.\"[152] The first day of application of the \"Iberian exception\", by which the regulated price of electricity is calculated with a cap on gas for its generation, was 15 June. The PVPC is the voluntary price for the small consumer, for which more will be paid for electricity for compensation to thermal power plants and the greater use of gas and coal in the midst of a heatwave.[154] The last day of the Spanish heatwave was 18 June, an event termed \"intense, extensive and extraordinary\" according to AEMET, which determined that the springtime heatwave was among the earliest in the year since Spain began keeping records.[155] Estimates from the Carlos III Health Institute placed the total June death toll at 830.[156][32]"

        "content": " Hurricane Agnes was the costliest hurricane to hit the United States at the time, causing an estimated $2.1\u00a0billion in damage. The hurricane's death toll was 128.[1] The effects of Agnes were widespread, from the Caribbean to Canada, with much of the east coast of the United States affected. Damage was heaviest in Pennsylvania, where Agnes was the state's wettest tropical cyclone. Due to the significant effects, the name Agnes was retired in the spring of 1973. Agnes was the second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed as a tropical depression on June\u00a014 from the interaction of a polar front and an upper trough over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The storm emerged into the western Caribbean Sea on June\u00a015, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Agnes the next day. Thereafter, Agnes slowly curved northward and passed just west of Cuba on June\u00a017. Early on June\u00a018, the storm intensified enough to be upgraded to Hurricane Agnes. Heading northward, the hurricane eventually made landfall near Panama City, Florida, late on June\u00a019. After moving inland, Agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered Georgia. The weakening trend halted as the storm crossed over Georgia and into South Carolina. While over eastern North Carolina, Agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm on June\u00a021, as a result of baroclinic activity. Early the following day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near New York City as a strong tropical storm. Agnes quickly became an extratropical cyclone on June\u00a023, and tracked to the northwest of Great Britain, before being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone on July\u00a06. Though it moved slowly across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the damage Agnes caused in Mexico is unknown. Although the storm bypassed the tip of Cuba, heavy rainfall occurred, killing seven people. In Florida, Agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak, with at least 26\u00a0confirmed twisters, two of which were spawned in Georgia. The tornadoes and two initially unconfirmed tornadoes in Florida alone resulted in over $4.5\u00a0million (1972\u00a0USD) in damage and six fatalities. At least 2,082\u00a0structures in Florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed. About\u00a01,355 other dwellings experienced minor losses. Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane, no hurricane-force winds were reported. Along the coast abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage, especially between Apalachicola and Cedar Key. Light to moderate rainfall was reported in Florida, though no significant flooding occurred. In Georgia, damage was limited to two tornadoes, which caused approximately $275,000 in losses. Minimal effects were also recorded in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Tennessee; though one fatality was reported in Delaware. The most significant effects, by far, occurred in Pennsylvania, mostly due to intense flooding. The hurricane severely flooded the Susquehanna River and the Lackawanna River causing major damage to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metropolitan area. In both Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined, about 43,594 structures were either destroyed or significantly damaged. In Canada, a mobile home was toppled, killing two people."

        "content": "In early-mid June\u00a01972, atmospheric conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis in the Caribbean Sea. Banded convection developed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea by June\u00a011, though the system did not significantly organize. After an upper trough moved east, wind shear decreased, causing lower atmospheric pressures observations in Cozumel, Quintana Roo, Mexico.[2] It is estimated that a tropical depression developed by 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a014, while centered over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, about 78 miles (126\u00a0km) southeast of M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n.[3] The depression tracked eastward and entered the western Caribbean Sea on June\u00a015.[2] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories on the depression until 1500\u00a0UTC on June\u00a015.[4] Early on June\u00a016 at 0000\u00a0UTC, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Agnes.[3] However, the depression was not operationally upgraded until sixteen hours later.[5] After becoming a tropical storm on June\u00a016, Agnes slowly curved northward and approached the Yucat\u00e1n Channel.[3] Late on June\u00a017, it was noted that projected path indicated the possibly of landfall in western Cuba.[6] However, the storm remained offshore, though it closely brushed the western tip of Cuba. At 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a018, Agnes intensified into a hurricane while in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.[3] Prematurely, the National Hurricane Center operationally upgraded Agnes to a hurricane at 0200\u00a0UTC on that day.[7] Upon becoming a hurricane, Agnes attained its maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), though it had not reached its minimum atmospheric pressure. Due to unfavorable conditions, Agnes leveled-off slightly in intensity and weakened to a minimal hurricane while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States.[2] Shortly before 2200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a019, Agnes made landfall near Cape San Blas, Florida with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[8] At 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020, only a few hours after moving inland, Agnes weakened to a tropical storm. After crossing the Florida/Alabama/Georgia stateline, Agnes rapidly weakened to a tropical depression. While over Georgia, the depression curved northeastward and eventually to the east-northeast after entering South Carolina.[2] Though the storm had not dissipated, the National Hurricane Center issued its final bulletin on Agnes at 1600\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020.[9] By early on June\u00a021, a large extratropical trough spawned a low pressure area, which resulted in baroclinic activity. As a result, Agnes restrengthened into a tropical storm at 1800\u00a0UTC on June\u00a021, while centered over eastern North Carolina.[2] Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center noted decreasing atmospheric pressures, and indicated that winds had reached gale-force winds and once again upgraded Agnes to a tropical storm.[10] By early on June\u00a022, Agnes emerged into the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, where it continued to re-intensify. At 1200\u00a0UTC, Agnes reached its minimum atmospheric pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg), as reported by a reconnaissance aircraft. However, maximum sustained winds were at only 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[2][3] Late on June\u00a022, Agnes made its final landfall on Long Beach, New York, on Long Island,  with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[11] Agnes changed into an extratropical cyclone once cold air invaded its circulation late on June\u00a022, completing its extratropical transition on the next day. The system looped across south-central Pennsylvania on June\u00a023 and then looped across southern Ontario on June\u00a025. It spawned a tornado in Maniwaki, Qu\u00e9bec, early that day, which killed two and injured 11\u00a0people. The cyclone sped east-northeast, reaching Cape Breton Island on June\u00a027 before intensifying as it re-entered the North Atlantic. After moving as far north as the 61st\u00a0parallel while crossing the 25th\u00a0meridian west on the morning of June\u00a029, Agnes turned southeastward. Its central pressure bottomed out near 980 millibars (29\u00a0inHg) towards 0000 UTC on June\u00a030. Between July\u00a01 and July\u00a03, the long-lived system looped between Ireland and Iceland while weakening once more. The system turned northeast, strengthening one more time while accelerating across the Hebrides on July\u00a04 through 5. A stronger system moving in from the west finally absorbed Agnes on July\u00a06, while located to the southeast of Iceland.[12]"

In addition, the gale warnings in the Florida Keys were extended to include areas from Fort Myers Beach to Clearwater.[14] At 2200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a018, a hurricane warning became effective from St. Marks to Panama City.[15] The gale warnings which were in effect for the Florida Keys and Fort Myers Beach to Clearwater was discontinued at 1000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a019.[16] It is likely that the hurricane warning was discontinued after the National Hurricane Center downgraded Agnes to a tropical storm at 2200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020.[8] Two hours later, all gale warnings along the West Coast of Florida were discontinued.[17]"

The highest tides reported were at Cedar Key, reaching 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) above normal sea levels. The second largest waves were 6.4 feet (2.0\u00a0m), recorded at Apalachicola. In contrast, few observations of high tides along the east coast of Florida exist; the highest reported was 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) above average in Jacksonville.[2] In Alligator Point, at least 16\u00a0homes were swept off their foundations. Six bridges connecting Cedar Key to the mainland areas of Florida were submerged. In addition, a bridge from Coquina Key to St. Petersburg was also underwater due to high tides.[19] Tampa Bay had an unusually high tide flooding the low lying Shore Acres neighborhood in St. Petersburg.[20] Nearly the entire state of Florida reported rainfall, though it was usually in the light to moderate range. Among the highest amounts of precipitation recorded were 8.97 inches (228\u00a0mm) in Naples, 8.43 inches (214\u00a0mm) in Big Pine Key, 7.3 inches (190\u00a0mm) in the Everglades, and 7.17 inches (182\u00a0mm) in Tallahassee.[2] Near Okeechobee, larger amounts of rainfall may have occurred, though there were no specific observations in that vicinity.[21] Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane, no reports of hurricane-force winds exist. However, several locations observed tropical storm force winds. The highest sustained winds and gusts were 52 and 69\u00a0mph (84 and 111\u00a0km/h), both recorded at the Kennedy Space Center. Other reports of at least tropical storm force sustained winds were at 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) in Crestview and Jacksonville, 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h) in Flamingo, 43\u00a0mph (69\u00a0km/h) in Key West, and two observations of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) in Panama City.[2] Throughout the state, Agnes spawned at least 15\u00a0tornadoes, while several tornadoes were operationally unconfirmed. Initially referred to as a \"windstorm\", one of those twisters destroyed 50\u00a0mobile homes and a fishing camp in Okeechobee, as well as caused six fatalities. Another significant tornado occurred in Cape Canaveral, which destroyed two homes and 30\u00a0trailers; it also damaged 20\u00a0houses and the Port Canaveral Coast Guard station. Overall, more than 100\u00a0people were left homeless and caused 23 injuries and over $500,000 in damage. The costliest tornado was also spawned in Brevard County and it destroyed 44\u00a0planes at the Merritt Island Airport and an apartment building. In addition, several houses in a nearby subdivision were also damaged. Losses from this tornado are estimated at $3\u00a0million. Due to a combination of high tides, rainfall, winds, and tornadoes, 96\u00a0dwellings were destroyed, while about 1,802\u00a0suffered damage to some degree. The destruction of 177\u00a0mobile homes was reported and 374\u00a0others were significantly damaged. Furthermore, 988\u00a0small businesses in the state were either destroyed or had major damage.[22] Eight counties in Florida reported at least $1\u00a0million in damage, including $12.1\u00a0million in Pinellas, $7.1\u00a0million in Sarasota, $4.1\u00a0million in Brevard, $3.1\u00a0million in Pasco, $2\u00a0million in Manatee, $1.4\u00a0million in Wakulla and Franklin, $1.3\u00a0million in Monroe, and $1\u00a0million in losses in Hillsborough Counties.[23] Although the damage toll estimated by the National Hurricane Center was at $8.243\u00a0million,[24] the National Climatic Data Center noted that at least $39\u00a0million in losses were reported.[23] In addition, nine fatalities were reported in Florida.[24]"

The tornado in Pierce County caused $25,000 in damage and one injury.[25] Losses were more significant from the twister in Coffee County, reaching $250,000.[26] One mobile home in Georgia suffered significant damage, though it is unknown if this was related to the tornadoes.[22] Though the damage from both tornadoes combined was about $275,000,[25][26] the National Hurricane Center notes only $205,000 in losses.[24] In Alabama, tides up to 1.3 feet (0.40\u00a0m) above normal were reported in the Mobile Bay area. Though rainfall only reached 3.93 inches (100\u00a0mm) and 1.08 inches (27\u00a0mm) in Dothan and Mobile,[21] precipitation from the storm in the state of Alabama peaked at 7.67 inches (195\u00a0mm) in Headland. Damage in the state was minor, though low-lying streets in the Gulf Shores were flooded.[27] In some areas of South Carolina, the storm dropped as much as 9.5 inches (240\u00a0mm) of rain in less than 36\u00a0hours. As a result, several rivers flooded. Along the Pee Dee River, pastures, small grains, and soy bean crops near Cheraw suffered major damage; similar effects occurred along the Congaree River near Columbia, though damage was lesser. In Greenville, damage to basements, streets, and water systems occurred after the Reedy River overflowed.[28] Damage in South Carolina was minor, totaling to only $50,000.[24] Effects were very minimal in Tennessee and limited to light rainfall in the eastern portions of the state, generally reaching no more than 3 inches (76\u00a0mm).[21] The highest amount of precipitation recorded was 4.59 inches (117\u00a0mm) in Unicoi.[29]"

The hardest hit area was the Patapsco River valley, with widespread destruction of buildings, roads, and railroads in the state park, at Daniels including its mill,[37] at Ellicott City, and Oella.  The flooding was first reported in the early morning hours of June\u00a022 and water was reported as high as 40 feet (12\u00a0m) above normal.[38] River Road along the Patapsco was almost completely washed out. More than 900 people were evacuated from their homes.  National guard helicopters were used to rescue workmen from the roof of the Daniels' plant. In Elkridge, a family of six was forced from their home and they attempted to reach high ground in a small boat.  It capsized and all six held onto the boat for several hours until it reached more shallow water. In Howard County, a total of 704 county residents were left homeless. More than 80 homes in the Ellicott City area were damaged and 72 homes in Elkridge were affected.  In Laurel, the 9th Street Bridge crossing the Patuxent River was washed away by flood waters.  In Anne Arundel County, all roads linking the county with Baltimore city or county were closed (including the Baltimore Beltway) as were all roads \"near the Patuxent River\" including Waysons Corner where over 300 homes were evacuated.[34]   The Patapsco flooded residential homes in parts of the county's North Linthicum, Pumphrey, and Belle Grove Road, Brooklyn Park neighborhoods.[34] The Gwynn Oak Amusement Park closed after suffering severe damage from flooding when Hurricane Agnes caused Gwynns Falls to overflow. In 1974, the park's rides were auctioned off. The carousel was moved and is still in operation on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. A popular footbridge in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park which led across a branch of the Potomac River to an overlook of Great Falls was washed away and not rebuilt until 1996.[39] As a result of Agnes' rains, Conowingo Dam, astride the Susquehanna River just north of the Chesapeake Bay, recorded its all-time highest flow rate and stream heights.[40]  Before the river crested, the water came within feet of overtopping the dam. As the dam's normal flood control devices seemed unable to cope, engineers had placed charges to blow out a section of the dam to prevent a catastrophic failure. The towns along the Susquehanna below the canal, Port Deposit, Perryville, and Havre de Grace, were flooded as  torrents of water rushed through streets.  Late on June 23, a mandatory evacuation of Port Deposit's nearly 1,000 residents was ordered as the river continued to rise, causing the fire department to bring evacuees out by boat during an eight-hour period as over four-feet of water filled Main Street.[41]"

Overall, the rains peaked at 19 inches (480\u00a0mm) in the western portions of Schuylkill County.[21] As a result, Agnes is listed as the wettest tropical cyclone on record for the state of Pennsylvania. Overall, more than 100,000\u00a0people were forced to leave their homes due to flooding. The Allegheny River reached above flood stage at several low-lying locations and at some places rose about 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) per hour during the height of the storm. Additionally, the Susquehanna River threatened to reach record crests along its course.[42] Some buildings were under 13\u00a0ft (4.0\u00a0m) of water in Harrisburg.[42] At the Governor's Mansion, the first floor was submerged by flood waters.[43] Governor Milton Shapp and his wife Muriel had to be evacuated by boat due to flooding. More than one hundred Harrisburg YMCA campers and staff were evacuated using two CH-47 Chinook helicopters flown by the National Guard at Camp Shikellimy located downstream of DeHart Dam in Middle Paxton Township.[31] Hundreds were trapped in their homes in Wilkes-Barre due to the overflowing Susquehanna River. At the historic cemetery in Forty Fort, 2,000\u00a0caskets were washed away, leaving body parts on porches, roofs, and in basements. In Luzerne County alone, 25,000\u00a0homes and businesses were either damaged or destroyed. Losses in that county totaled to $1\u00a0billion.[43] A bridge collapsed in Danville, which caused two Penn Central diesel locomotives and several freight cars to fall into a swollen creek.[31] In Reading, the Schuylkill River reached a record flood of 31\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (9.60\u00a0m). Hundreds of people were evacuated and over a hundred homes destroyed. Floods reached as far inland as 3rd street in the heart of the city.[44] In Chadds Ford Township in Delaware County, the Brandywine Creek crested at 16.5 feet (5.0\u00a0m), sending flood waters into the city. Water poured into the first floor of the Brandywine River Museum of Art in Chadds Ford Township, which threatened at least $2.5\u00a0million in N.C. Wyeth paintings, though they were quickly moved to the upper floors.[42] Additionally, 36\u00a0Girl Scouts were rescued by state police while at a camp in York.[31] Throughout the state of Pennsylvania, Agnes demolished more than 3,000\u00a0businesses and 68,000\u00a0homes, while damaging numerous others. Consequently, at least 220,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[43] The damage and death toll was the highest in Pennsylvania, with 50\u00a0fatalities and $2.3\u00a0billion in losses in that state alone,  including more than $1\u00a0billion in damage to businesses, $500\u00a0million to roadways, $120\u00a0million to crops, and around $40\u00a0million to school districts. Approximately 150\u00a0bridges either became impassable or were swept away.[28] Following Agnes, three news correspondents and the pilot died in a helicopter crash in Harrisburg on June\u00a026, 1972, while reporting on the flooding. The victims were Del Vaughn of CBS News and Sid Brenner and Louis Clark of WCAU in Philadelphia, and the pilot, Mike Sedio.

Sections of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad main line between Hornell and Binghamton were severely damaged. It is mainly regarded as the death of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad since the costs of damages were high and put the final dagger into the company. Flooding in the upper Allegheny River basin was particularly exacerbated by the construction of the Kinzua Dam less than a decade prior; several towns in Cattaraugus County suffered extensive road and bridge damage that, four decades later, had yet to be repaired, with the state and local governments opting to abandon creek and river crossings instead of reconstruct them. The dam succeeded in preventing further damage downstream in western Pennsylvania, and much of the flood-prone areas in the Allegheny Reservoir region had already been cleared of residents in preparation for the dam's construction. In Elmira, porches and garages were ripped loose, the Walnut St. bridge was carried away, Maple Ave. to Notre Dame High School was \"underwater\", and on S. Main St., Gerould's Pharmacy at W. Hudson was engulfed by 10\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (3.12\u00a0m) of water. Hornell's damage was minimal largely due to the protection of two dam systems installed after the devastating 1935 flood.  Both the Arkport and Almond Dams saved Hornell from the level of damage found in neighboring communities. Three US Army Corps of Engineers were killed in Hornell when their helicopter came in contact with power lines over Crosby Creek. The height of the floodwaters has been marked in the entrance to the Corning Museum of Glass, showing that much of the museum was under water to a height of about 1.6 m above the floor, causing substantial damage to the collection and archives. Parts of Corning were under more than 3 m of flood waters."

In the Georgetown section, waterfront streets along the Potomac River were submerged in as much as 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) of water.[48] The Rock Creek also overflowed its banks, which sent about 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) of water onto the Rock Creek Parkway. As a result, at least 100\u00a0cars were abandoned and several motorists required rescuing by police.[42] No national monuments were affected by flood waters.[48] However, about 350\u00a0dwellings in Washington, D.C. suffered minor damage.[22] At the White House, reporters noted wet carpets in the press room of the basement floor.[42] Though the storm passed just west of some areas in New England, minimal impact in that region of the United States.

High tides occurred along the coastline of Rhode Island, reaching 3.2 feet (0.98\u00a0m) above normal in Providence.[2] In combination with rainfall and high tides, some coastal roads were flooded. Strong winds felled trees and numerous limbs in Massachusetts, causing power outages and property damage in the western and central portions of the state. One home in Great Barrington was struck by a tree; a similar incident occurred in Milford. High winds in southern and eastern Vermont knocked over trees and snapped off limbs, which resulted in scattered power outages, roads being blocked, and minor property damage.

As a result, the city lost millions of dollars from tourism, which led the officials of Panama City to file a $100\u00a0million lawsuit against the National Weather Service. Officials in that city believed that the National Weather Service and other media outlets made \"exaggerated and erroneous\" forecasts and reports on the storm.[54] Nixon also declared the states of Florida, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York as disaster areas. Twenty\u00a0of Maryland's 24\u00a0counties were declared a disaster area. Agnes had a devastating impact on the already-bankrupt railroads in the northeastern United States, as lines were washed out and shipments were delayed: The resulting cost of repairing the damage was one of the factors leading to the creation of the federally financed Conrail.[citation needed] Some Americans sardonically referred to the storm as \"Hurricane Agony\".[55] The severe floods near Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania, were the catalyst for the construction of the Tioga Reservoir in 1973. The flooding in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and the adjacent town of Kingston led to the construction of a levee system that in 2006 successfully prevented massive flooding and, in the same year, was deemed very safe and protective by the Army Corps of Engineers. The levee also protected the area from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Irene in 2011, with the water cresting just barely below the height of the structure. Conversely, the existing Kinzua Dam, built against the wishes of the Seneca Nation of New York, spared much of Western Pennsylvania from the worst flooding, by filling the Allegheny Reservoir to capacity.

        "content": " Typhoon Alex, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Etang,[1] affected the Taiwan, China, and South Korea during July\u00a01987. Typhoon Alex developed from the monsoon trough that spawned a tropical disturbance late on July\u00a021 southwest of Guam which organized into a tropical depression shortly thereafter. The system steadily became better organized, and the next day, a tropical depression had developed. Satellite intensity estimates gradually increased, and on July\u00a023, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alex. After initially tracking west-northwest, Tropical Storm Alex started tracking northwest. An eye developed on July\u00a024, and on the next day, Alex was classified as a typhoon, when Alex attained its peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg). Alex weakened while tracking more northward, though interaction with Taiwan resulted in a more westward track starting on July\u00a027. The storm struck near Shanghai as a tropical storm, and weakened over land, although it remained identifiable through August\u00a02. Across Taiwan, the storm inflicted minor damage and one person was killed. In the province of Zhejiang, Alex damaged or destroyed over 200\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats, wiped out 22\u00a0bridges, snapped 32\u00a0power\u00a0lines, and flooded four reservoirs. Damage there exceeded US$1.8\u00a0million. In Jiaxing, at least 121,405 hectares (300,000 acres) of farmland were flooded. Nation-wide, 125\u00a0people were killed and roughly 200 were wounded. Close to 700\u00a0homes were demolished while roughly 200\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats were damaged. Across South Korea, the storm dumped heavy rainfall, with daily totals of 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) in some places, triggering flooding and landslides."

        "content": "Typhoon Alex developed in the western edge of the Western Pacific monsoon trough which stretched 2,500\u00a0km (1,555\u00a0mi) near the 10th parallel north from the Carolina Islands to the International Date Line. Late on July\u00a021, satellite imagery first detected a tropical disturbance 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) to the southwest of Guam,[2] which prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to upgrade the system to a tropical depression.[3][nb 1][nb 2] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to follow the system as the disturbance had developed curved banding features. A rapid increase in both convection and organization followed, and at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a022, satellite imagery showed the development of a central dense overcast, with Dvorak intensity estimates supporting an intensity of 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph). At 19:30\u00a0UTC, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert despite satellite imagery only detecting a broad, ill-defined low-level circulation, with a minimum barometric pressure of 1005\u00a0mbar (29.68\u00a0inHg). By 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a023, Dvorak intensity estimates reached T2.5/65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) and a ship to the north of the system reported winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph), which resulted in the JTWC declaring the system a tropical depression.[2] Initially, the depression was tracking west[6] and was forecast by the JTWC to track across the Philippine Islands. This was in agreement with most tropical cyclone forecast models showing the storm track across the archipelago and the turning northward in the general direction of China, although the JTWC eventually shifted the track further north into the Luzon Straits. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a023, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Alex,[2] with the JMA doing the same six hours later. Late the next evening, the JMA upgraded Alex to a severe tropical storm[3] as satellite images showed the center of the storm moving under the deep convection after previously being exposed to its northeast. Continuing to slowly intensify,[2] Alex turned northwest.[6] It developed an eye between 15:00\u00a0UTC and 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024. The next morning the JTWC declared Alex a typhoon while also estimating that the storm attained its peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[2] Upon becoming a typhoon, Alex was located 220\u00a0km (135\u00a0mi) east of the northern tip of Luzon. By this time, most forecast models showed a northward movement east of Taiwan due to a weakness in a subtropical ridge south of Japan and the presence of a surface front across the east coast of Asia.[2] On the evening of July\u00a025, the JMA classified Alex as a typhoon while also reporting that Alex obtained its peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg).[3] Although satellite images continued to depict a warm spot, suggesting the presence of an eye,[2] both the JMA and JTWC estimated that Alex fell below typhoon intensity on July\u00a026;[7] however, according to the JMA, Alex briefly re-intensified back to a typhoon that evening.[3] Alex turned north in response to the aforementioned front, passing 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) east of Taipei. Interaction with the high terrain of Taiwan caused Alex to deflect west, striking Wenzhou as a weakening tropical storm[2] on the evening of July\u00a027.[6] The storm rapidly dissipated over land according to the JTWC,[2] although the JMA continued to track Alex as a minimal tropical storm[3] when it moved back over open water in the Sea of Japan on the evening of July\u00a028. Even though Alex failed to regenerate according to the JTWC,[2] the JMA continued to track the system as a tropical depression through August\u00a02.[3]"

        "content": " Severe Tropical Storm Ampil, known in the Philippines as Severe Tropical Storm Inday, was a tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage in the Ryukyu Islands and East and Northeast China in late July 2018. The tenth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Ampil developed into a tropical depression east of Luzon on July\u00a017. The system gradually strengthened over the following days amid a marginally favorable environment and became a severe tropical storm late on July\u00a019 as it moved northwest. Maintaining its strength, Ampil passed over Okinawa Island from July\u00a020 to 21. Thereafter, Ampil weakened slightly while crossing the East China Sea, before making landfall in Shanghai, China, on July\u00a022. The system weakened slowly over land and degraded to a tropical depression on July\u00a023. The system turned eastwards as it continued weakening over land, diminishing to a remnant low on July\u00a025 and dissipating fully a day later over the Russian Far East. Ampil produced gusty winds across the Ryukyu Islands from July\u00a020 to 21, causing disruptions to transport and businesses. Moisture extending from Ampil also caused thunderstorms in Fukuoka. From July\u00a022 to 25, Ampil generated heavy rains across much of East and Northeast China, affecting more than 2.3\u00a0million people and causing record-breaking flooding within the watershed of the Songhua River. About 387,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Transport was severely disrupted, with 600 flights into Shanghai canceled and ferries and rail services suspended. A person in Shandong was killed by a fallen tree. About 7,200 houses were damaged or destroyed, while 169,000 hectares (420,000 acres) of cropland were damaged. Direct economic losses reached \u00a51.63\u00a0billion (US$246\u00a0million).[nb 1]"

        "content": "A broad area of disturbed weather developed within the monsoon trough on July\u00a015 roughly 1,215\u00a0km (755\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Okinawa.[2] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared that the system consolidated into a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a017.[3][nb 2] The system initially moved east-northeastwards around a ridge near the Equator, while gradually organizing amid generally favorable upper-level wind patterns and high sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F).[5] As the system was located within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) gave the depression the local name Inday at 03:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018.[6] Just hours later, the JMA stated that the depression became a tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC and named it Ampil;[3] the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) made a similar declaration six hours later.[7] The recently named tropical storm was large and asymmetric \u2013 a large rainband extended over the southern half of the system, while the low-level circulation center was exposed.[8] Intensification was slow as upper-level winds restricted outflow in Ampil's northern half, preventing thunderstorms from developing there. This left the low-level circulation elongated, hindering quicker consolidation of the system. On July\u00a019, Ampil began to turn northwestwards as a strong subtropical ridge to the north began to dominate the steering pattern.[9] Later on July\u00a019, the unfavorable upper-level winds diminished slightly and allowed thunderstorms to develop over Ampil's center of circulation, resulting in it becoming well-defined.[10] The JMA reported that Ampil became a severe tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC, as its 10-minute sustained winds increased to 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). The system's central pressure also dropped to an estimated 985\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.09\u00a0inHg).[3] Ampil then maintained this intensity for the next two days due to the limiting effect of surrounding dry air, while continuing to track northwestwards.[3][11] In the meantime, Ampil exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020,[12] and passed over Okinawa Island during the night of July\u00a020 to 21.[13] According to the JMA, weakening took place on July\u00a022 as the storm's winds decreased slightly;[3] conversely the JTWC stated that Ampil's 1-minute sustained winds increased to 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) at 00:00\u00a0UTC.[7] Around 04:30\u00a0UTC, Ampil made landfall over eastern Chongming Island in Shanghai, becoming only the third tropical cyclone to make landfall in Shanghai since 1949.[14] The system weakened slowly as it pushed inland, degrading to a tropical depression on July\u00a023. The depression turned northwards then eastwards while moving over Northeast China on July\u00a024, before degenerating to a remnant low-pressure area by 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a025. The leftover system eventually dissipated over the Russian Far East while still inland by 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a026.[3]"

An automated weather station on Hengsha Island recorded a rainfall total of 112.8\u00a0mm (4.44\u00a0in).[33] As Ampil tracked further inland from July\u00a022 to 25, it produced a large swath of heavy rain across East and Northeast China. Rainfall totals exceeded 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) in Rizhao, Tianjin, Chengde, and Qinhuangdao, with a peak accumulation of 324\u00a0mm (12.8\u00a0in) recorded in Qinglong County. The heavy rains caused water levels along 17 tributaries of the Songhua River to rise up to 2.01\u00a0m (6.59\u00a0ft) above the ordinary high water mark. Flooding along the Hulan River reached an all-time high; the Chaohe River recorded its largest floods since 1998. Throughout the country, Ampil affected 2.334\u00a0million people, killing one person in Shandong with a fallen tree and causing direct economic losses of \u00a51.63\u00a0billion (US$246\u00a0million).[34][35] According to statistics from the National Disaster Reduction Center, about 169,200 hectares (418,000 acres) of cropland were damaged, of which 6,300 hectares (16,000 acres) were completely lost.

Caused by a lightning strike on August 15, the fire began near Cima Dome (a geological formation for which the fire was named) and exhibited rapid growth over the following 36 hours, aided by weather conditions and a lack of available firefighting resources. During this period the Dome Fire destroyed only 6 structures, but burned more than a quarter of the Cima Dome Joshua tree forest, one of the largest and densest populations of Joshua trees known in the world. The fire killed as many as 1.3\u00a0million Joshua trees. No injuries or fatalities were reported among firefighters or civilians. The fire cost $2.2\u00a0million to suppress, and burned 43,273 acres (17,512\u00a0ha) before being fully contained on August 24.[1][2] The Dome Fire was one of the many large wildfires of the 2020 California wildfire season, which was notable for its severity. The Dome Fire burned at the same time as other wildfires in the state considered a higher priority, such as the Lake Fire elsewhere in Southern California and the LNU, SCU, CZU, and August Complex fires, which contributed to the lack of fire suppression resources available to the Dome Fire effort.[3] The mass Joshua tree destruction resulting from the Dome Fire has led to concern about the future of the species, which is predicted to face declines in its range due to development and climate change, with its increasing wildfire risk. Wildfires are not unknown in the region; the 2005 Hackberry Complex, also sparked by lightning, burned more than 70,000 acres in the Mojave National Preserve southwest of the Dome Fire footprint. However, fire is not an integral or frequent part of the fragile desert ecosystem, as it is in some other California ecosystems (such as chaparral and coniferous forests), and species like the Joshua tree do not have adaptations to readily protect or recover from wildfires. Therefore, the ecological ramifications of the Dome Fire are expected to be long-lasting, if not permanent.[4]"

Relative humidity was low, and an abnormal lack of moisture from the monsoon that summer meant vegetation was even drier than usual.[5] This meant that conditions were already conducive to wildfire growth when a plume of moist and unstable air brought north from the decaying Tropical Storm Fausto off the coast of Baja California interacted with the high pressure system in the desert southwest on August 15 and 16. This led to a dry thunderstorm outbreak across California.[6] Nearly 11,000 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were recorded, very few accompanied by significant precipitation. The frequent lightning and gusty outflow winds combined with the heat and dry vegetation ignited many quick-spreading fires throughout the state, creating an immediate draw on firefighting resources."

The fire, driven by erratic winds, was burning into inaccessible wilderness areas, and passing thunderstorms caused the head of the fire to switch directions rapidly, creating extreme and potentially unsafe conditions for firefighting.[8] The combination of challenging firefighting conditions and the inability to get more firefighting resources meant that the crew was forced to pull back for the night. By 11:00\u00a0a.m. the next morning (August 16), the Dome Fire was more than 16,000 acres.[3] Winds gusted up to 20 miles per hour, and temperatures reached a reported 115 degrees.[9] This made the fire difficult to stop, and it experienced its largest single day of growth, increasing to more than 40,000 acres. During this time it exhibited active fire behavior, including pyrocumulus clouds and fire whirls. More resources finally arrived on the 16th, a team of smokejumpers from Redding, California, a helitanker, and multiple fixed-wing aircraft.[5] One of those included the Boeing 747-400 Global Supertanker.[10] During these first two days, crews also lit backfires\u2014or controlled burns\u2014to stop the Dome Fire's progression to the east, which threatened habitat for the critically endangered desert tortoise.[7] Conditions made the going difficult. In addition to the wind, temperatures remained extremely high; in the Baker area 20 miles to the west of the fire, temperatures reached a high of 117 degrees on August 17.[11] Another challenging factor was the lack of bulldozers, often used to create a firebreak clear of vegetation so as to stop a fire's spread. The ecologically sensitive nature of the preserve meant much of the firefighting had to be done by hand, with aircraft supporting when available.[11] In the afternoon of August 17, the fire's management was transferred to a Type 2 incident management team, which was able to requisition more personnel and resources.[3] Eight aircraft continued to drop water and fire retardant to halt the fire's spread, which also slowed as it encountered rockier areas with sparser vegetation.[11][7] During the peak of the suppression and mop-up effort, more than 180 firefighters were assigned to the Dome Fire. On August 20, up to 0.5 inches of rain fell over the burn area, further helping the firefight, and on August 24, the Dome Fire was declared 100% contained.[5] The fire's advance was stopped at Morning Star Mine Road to the east, Powerline Road to the south, near Aiken Mine Road to the west, and near the intersection of Cima Road and Zinc Mine Road south of Striped Mountain to the north."

Cattle may have grazed on many other plants but let flammable blackbrush alone, which shielded many Joshua tree seedlings. The eventual combination of blackbrush, flammable invasive species like red brome, and dense Joshua tree stands led to a wildfire-receptive ecology.[5] The death of so many Joshua trees, which are native only to the southwestern United States, led to concern about the species' vulnerability to climate change and other pressures.[12] Joshua trees are split into two varieties\u2014an eastern and a western\u2014and while the Cima Dome population was of the less-threatened eastern kind, the western species was, at the time, a candidate for threatened status under the California Endangered Species Act, though it did not ultimately become listed as such.[13] The Mojave National Preserve's lead wildlife biologist estimated that small animal mortality had been low, under 20% for small reptile and mammal species such as snakes, lizards, and rabbits. The Dome Fire also burned in areas considered habitat for the desert tortoise, a critically endangered species, but \"no direct tortoise mortality\" was found during or after the fire in surveys, and total mortality was estimated at \"perhaps a dozen individuals.\"[3]"

Replanting efforts took place in the winter of 2021 and are planned to continue through 2023, relying on volunteer planting, watering, and reporting programs organized by the National Park Service.[13][14] According to the National Park Service, \"Joshua trees have poor seed dispersal and may only migrate about 100 feet for every 20 years,\" making these projects critical for the long-term recovery of the species in the Cima Dome region. Additionally, Cima Dome has been modelled as a climate refugia for Joshua trees, making their existence there important for the long-term health of the species.[14]"

The storm quickly weakened over the dry, mountainous terrain of the Arabian Peninsula, before dissipating on October\u00a015. Upon moving ashore, Cyclone Luban produced flooding rains in Somalia, Oman, and Yemen. The cyclone killed 14\u00a0people in Yemen, when heavy rainfall cut off villages and damaged roads. Damage in the country was estimated at US$1\u00a0billion.[nb 1] In Oman, desert rainfall caused a small locust outbreak. Luban coexisted with Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Titli in the Bay of Bengal, marking the first time since 1971 that two storms of such intensity were active at the same time in the North Indian Ocean."

        "content": "On October\u00a04, an upper-level low persisted over the southeast Arabian Sea.[1] That day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first mentioned an area of scattered convection southwest of India as an area for potential tropical cyclogenesis, due to projections from tropical cyclone forecast models. The convective system was located in the warm waters of the Arabian Sea in an area of low wind shear.[2] The circulation slowly became more defined,[3] developing a low-pressure area on October\u00a05. On October\u00a06, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression ARB 04. A day later, the agency upgraded the system to a deep depression, and on October\u00a08, the IMD upgraded it further to Cyclonic Storm Luban.[1] On the same day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Luban, giving it the designation Tropical Cyclone 05A.[4] By that time the JTWC initiated advisories, Luban had rotating rainbands around a persistent central area of thunderstorms, with good outflow to the north. The circulation became better defined over time, steered generally west-northwestward by a subtropical ridge to its north.[4] On October\u00a09, the IMD upgraded Luban to a severe cyclonic storm,[5] as the thunderstorms continued to bloom over the circulation.[6] A day later, the IMD upgraded Luban further to a very severe cyclonic storm, with maximum sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), equivalent to a hurricane.[7] Luban coexisted with Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Titli, marking the first time since 1977 that two storms of such intensity were active at the same time in the North Indian Ocean.[1] The JTWC also upgraded Luban to the same intensity on October\u00a010, noting the development of an eye feature.[8] Both the IMD and the JTWC estimated that Luban attained a peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). They also forecasted that the storm would continue its general trajectory and strike the Arabian Peninsula.[9][10] Caught between two ridges, Luban moved slowly toward the Arabian Peninsula. The slow movement caused upwelling, which cooled the waters, thus weakening the cyclone despite otherwise favorable conditions. The central core of convection diminished and became restricted to the eastern side of the circulation.[11][12] On October\u00a013, thunderstorm activity increased over the center, signaling some re-intensification.[13] Luban again weakened as it approached land, affected by the cooler water and air temperatures.[14] On October\u00a014, around 06:00\u00a0UTC, Luban made landfall in eastern Yemen, about 30\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) south of Al Ghaydah, with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[15] The storm rapidly weakened over the dry and mountainous terrain,[16] degenerating into a well-marked low on October 15.[1]"

Dalkout reported a 24-hour precipitation total of 145\u00a0mm (5.71\u00a0in) and Salalah of 138\u00a0mm (5.43\u00a0in).[19] The rains created temporary lakes between desert dunes, which produced a small locust outbreak.[20] To the south of the center, the outer rainbands of Luban dropped rains in Puntland, Somalia.[21] Cyclone Luban struck Yemen in the midst of a civil war and a cholera outbreak.[22] The United Nations Population Fund moved 1,250\u00a0rapid response kits to coastal areas of Yemen in anticipation of Luban's landfall. Medical teams also moved to the region on standby in preparation for storm victims.[23] Luban dropped heavy rainfall upon moving ashore, reaching 290\u00a0mm (11\u00a0in) in Al Ghaydah; there, wind gusts reached 102\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph).[1] Luban caused about US$1\u00a0billion in damage in Yemen,[24] with the worst effects in Al Mahrah Governorate,[25] where about 90% of the infrastructure was damaged. The storm killed 14\u00a0people in the country, and 124\u00a0people were injured, with 10\u00a0people missing. About 8,000\u00a0people were left homeless because of Luban.[26] Storm damage forced 2,203\u00a0families to leave their houses, using 38\u00a0schools for shelter.[27] Flooding washed away thousands of livestock,[28] and damaged Yemen's coastal roads and bridges, which disrupted relief efforts.[27][29] Dirt roads were washed away, isolating seven villages and about 3,000\u00a0people.[30] The port of Nishtun was closed during the storm, but was reopened in the subsequent weeks.[29][27] In Al-Masilah, flooding damaged or destroyed 62\u00a0houses. The storm damaged the hospital in Qishn District, forcing all workers to evacuate, and shutting down the facility for at least a week.[27] The storm damaged about 90% of the power grid in Al Ghaydah.[29] Many areas lost access to clean water after wells were destroyed. The Yemeni Red Crescent operated search and rescue missions, with help from a helicopter sent by Saudi Arabia.[27] In the storm's aftermath, various governments and non-governmental organizations provided emergency supplies to residents affected by Luban. The King Salman Relief Centre sent two trucks from Aden to the worst affected areas to distribute tents, blankets, and mattresses. The Oman Charitable Organization sent seven trucks with food and other supplies to eastern Yemen. The World Health Organization sent three tons of medical supplies, including kits for cholera, malaria, and general trauma.[29][27] About 10\u00a0days after the storm struck, the Emirates Red Crescent reconnected seven villages after clearing debris and restoring the dirt roads.[30] Al Mahrah Governorate allocated \ufdfc\u200e2\u00a0billion (US$2.55\u00a0million) for repairing public facilities.[24]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Erika was one of the deadliest and most destructive natural disasters in Dominica since Hurricane David in 1979. The fifth named storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Erika developed from a westward-moving tropical wave while well east of the Lesser Antilles. Hostile conditions, including dry air and wind shear, inhibited significant development, and Erika failed to acquire sustained winds beyond 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Contrary to predictions of a northwesterly recurvature, the cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through the Leeward Islands and emerged over the Caribbean Sea on August\u00a027. Erika succumbed to adverse conditions the following day, dissipating as a tropical cyclone near the Dominican Republic. The remnant system persisted for several more days, moving into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, before dissipating over Georgia on September\u00a03. Several islands experienced heavy rainfall during the passage of Erika, especially Dominica. The storm's asymmetric structure, coupled with the mountainous terrain of the island and ample moisture aloft, led to rainfall accumulations up to 33\u00a0in (850\u00a0mm). With grounds already saturated from antecedent rainfall, tremendous runoff quickly overwhelmed river basins and triggered catastrophic floods. Accompanying mudslides worsened the situation, temporarily damming the rivers before collapsing. Hundreds of homes were left uninhabitable and thousands of people were displaced; the entire town of Petite Savanne was evacuated and subsequently abandoned as a result of the storm. All told, 30\u00a0people died across the island in the nation's worst disaster since Hurricane David. The storm's devastating effects in Dominica prompted an influx of international assistance. Aid from multiple nations and intergovernmental organizations poured in to assist victims of the storm. Thousands of homes needed to be built or repaired, including 500\u20131,000 for the relocation of all of Petite Savanne's residents. Recovery in Dominica was halted in September\u00a02017 by Hurricane Maria, a Category\u00a05 hurricane that wrought far greater devastation on the island. In Guadeloupe, heavy rainfall in the vicinity of Basse-Terre caused flooding and mudslides, forcing roads to temporarily close. Approximately 250,000\u00a0people in Puerto Rico were left without electricity. The island experienced US$17.37\u00a0million[nb 1] in agricultural damage. In the Dominican Republic, a weather station in Barahona measured 24.26\u00a0in (616\u00a0mm) of rain, including 8.8\u00a0in (220\u00a0mm) in a single hour. About 823\u00a0homes suffered damage and 7,345 people were displaced. Five people died in Haiti, four from a weather-related traffic accident and one from a landslide. Total damage from Erika is estimated to be over US$500\u00a0million, with US$482.8\u00a0million in Dominica alone."

        "content": "On August\u00a020, 2015, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa, near the Atlantic shore.[1] The disorganized system emerged over the Atlantic Ocean several hundred miles southeast of the Cape Verde Islands the following day.[2][3] Moving quickly west, the system bypassed the Cape Verde Islands to the south on August\u00a022,[4] but remained largely disorganized. A sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on August\u00a023, though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate.[2] Organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis.[5] The trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18:00\u00a0UTC. The formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone; accordingly, the system was classified as Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Upon its designation, Erika was situated roughly 1,035\u00a0mi (1,665\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles.[2] The storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory, steered by a subtropical ridge to the north.[2][6] At the time of Erika's classification, forecast models diverged significantly on the potential future of the storm. Statistical guidance and the HWRF depicted a hurricane while the ECMWF and GFS showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear. The models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course. Accordingly, the NHC noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for Erika.[6] This uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones, but roughly average for weak, poorly organized systems.[7] Throughout August\u00a025 and into early August\u00a026, the convective organization of Erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air, periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.[8] Early on August\u00a027, Erika managed to intensify slightly, attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1,001\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg).[2] Around  09:00\u00a0UTC, the disorganized center of Erika passed near the northern tip of Guadeloupe, before emerging over the eastern Caribbean Sea.[2] Convection remained poorly-organized and mostly confined to eastern portions of the cyclone, as it traversed the eastern Caribbean Sea.[9] Multiple circulation centers were noted during the overnight of August\u00a027\u201328, all rotating around a broad general center. One such center moved over St. Croix and produced gale-force gusts. Environmental conditions ahead of the storm became increasingly hostile, and forecasters at the NHC continued to note unusually high uncertainty in their forecasts.[10] Further structural degradation ensued on August\u00a028 as Erika approached the Dominican Republic. Based on data from Hurricane Hunters, Erika degenerated into a broad area of low pressure\u2014no longer meeting the definition of a tropical cyclone\u2014shortly after 12:00\u00a0UTC, near the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic.[2] Operationally, the NHC maintained advisories on Erika until 13:30\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029.[11] It was also noted during those advisories that the center was completely devoid of convection, and whatever convection remained was reduced to the eastern half of the system.[12] Around 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, the remnants of Erika made landfall along the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic.[13] The disheveled system emerged over the Windward Passage early on August\u00a029.[12] Thereafter, the system skirted the northern coast of Cuba and entered the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a031. Turning northward, the disturbance eventually crossed northern Florida on September\u00a02, before dissipating over Georgia on the following day.[2]"

All non-essential government personnel were given administrative leave on August\u00a027. Owing to rough seas, local ports temporarily closed. Although airports remained open, several airlines cancelled flights.[15] A territory-wide curfew was imposed until the afternoon of August\u00a028.[16] Schools, ports, and beaches were closed across the Dominican Republic.[17] The Army of the Dominican Republic deployed 275\u00a0soldiers and alongside the nation's Air Force, assisted with the evacuation of residents. The Navy was placed on standby for potential search and rescue operations.[18] Officials in Haiti suspended air service, banned highway travel between departments, and ordered small watercraft to remain at port.[19] Evacuation shelters were opened across all departments and 254\u00a0prisoners were relocated from Gona\u00efves to three other facilities.[20]"

Surrounding areas reported significantly less rain, however.[41] Throughout the country, 823\u00a0homes suffered damage and 7,345\u00a0people were displaced. Erika blocked over 400 roads and left many power outages.[42] Winds gusts of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) in Azua caused at least RD$400\u00a0million (US$8.91\u00a0million) in damage to the banana crop.[32] Heavy rainfall also impacted Haiti, which was still recovering from a catastrophic earthquake in 2010; an estimated 60,000\u00a0people remained in emergency housing.[17] Four persons died and eleven others were hospitalized in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, when a truck crashed into a bus on rain-slicked roads and exploded.[33] A fifth death occurred during a landslide in Port-au-Prince. Two people in the area were injured after a house collapsed.[17] The remnants of Erika later brought much needed rains to Cuba, which was suffering from its worst drought since 1901.[17]"

Orographic influence exacerbated rainfall rates, and this was further compounded with the formation of a temporary mesoscale low over the island as the primary circulation of Erika continued west.[50] More than 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of rain fell across the entire island in less than 48\u00a0hours, with an island-wide average of 24\u00a0in (610\u00a0mm).[nb 3] During the period of heaviest rain, average rainfall across the entire island exceeded 3.5\u00a0in (90\u00a0mm) per hour. Rates along the Macoucherie River reached 11\u00a0in (270\u00a0mm) per hour. The heaviest rain was concentrated around the nation's tallest mountain, Morne Diablotins, where an estimated 31 to 33\u00a0in (800 to 850\u00a0mm) fell. Rainfall across Morne Diablotin National Park generally exceeded 24\u00a0in (600\u00a0mm). A secondary peak accumulation of 26 to 28\u00a0in (650 to 700\u00a0mm) occurred in the southeastern part of the island around Morne Trois Pitons.[51] Observed accumulations include 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm) at Gleau Gommier,[52] 12.62\u00a0in (321\u00a0mm) at Canefield Airport, and 8.74\u00a0in (222\u00a0mm) at Douglas\u2013Charles Airport.[2] With grounds already saturated from nearly two weeks of rain prior to Erika, much of the precipitation did not penetrate the surface; in multiple watersheds, runoff exceeded 60\u00a0percent of accumulations.[51] Catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides ensued across the island,[2] resulting in Dominica's worst natural disaster since Hurricane David in 1979.[53][54] Across the island's rugged terrain, the mudslides temporarily dammed overflowing rivers creating a buildup of water. These earthen dams subsequently collapsed, leading to amplified flooding downstream. Flow rates in these localized events vastly exceeded values expected by International Commission on Large Dams modeling. A post-storm study of 16\u00a0rivers on the island revealed peak discharge values in excess of 1,000\u00a0m3/s along 5 rivers, with a maximum of 2,876\u00a0m3/s along the Malabuka River.[51] Nearly 17,000 of the nation's 71,293\u00a0people were severely impacted by the storm.[55] A total of 30\u00a0people were killed,[2] 20\u00a0others were injured, and 574\u00a0people were left homeless.[30][31] More than 890\u00a0homes were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable.[56] Infrastructure suffered tremendous damage: 6\u00a0percent of bridges and 17\u00a0percent of roads were wiped out. Furthermore, half of the nation's bridges and a quarter of its roads were damaged.[57] Total losses amounted to EC$1.3\u00a0billion (US$482.8 million), roughly 90\u00a0percent of Dominica's gross domestic product.[31] Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit stated in a national announcement on August\u00a028 that, \"The visual damage I saw today, I fear, may have set our development process back by 20 years\".[19] Flooding crippled transportation and communication, with eight bridges severely damaged or destroyed, leaving many areas of the island isolated.[31][58] Boetica and Delices remained cut-off by ground for more than three weeks.[59] More than 12\u00a0major rivers topped their banks.[60] Approximately 45\u00a0percent of residents lost electricity,[58] and almost the entirety of the water supply network was damaged.[31] Additionally, 50\u00a0percent of telephone service was lost.[58] Both Canefield and Douglas\u2013Charles airports were flooded, with water rising above a small airplane at the latter.[61] Douglas\u2013Charles Airport sustained more than EC$39.5\u00a0million (US$14.6\u00a0million) in damage and was closed until September\u00a018.[62][63] The main river running through Roseau, the nation's capital, burst its banks during the overnight of August 26\u201327, flooding surrounding areas.[64] One person was killed during a mudslide and one building collapsed in the city.[61][65] The small community of Petite Savanne was virtually destroyed, with 217\u00a0homes leveled and all residents forced to evacuate.[66][67] Twenty people died or were presumed dead in the village, accounting for two-thirds of the deaths attributed to Erika in Dominica.[2][68] Residents dug through mud and debris, often with their bare hands, to rescue those trapped and in many cases did so with nearby homes on the verge of collapse.[60] The village was isolated for several days and residents buried victims before help arrived.[69]"

Approximately 100\u00a0personnel were deployed for various relief measures, including search and rescue.[72] The Dominica Spa Health and Wellness Association worked in conjunction with the Trinidad-based Centre for Human Development to provide psychological support to victims;[73] eight trauma specialists were sent to Dominica.[74] The psychiatric unit of Princess Margaret Hospital conducted field assessments and provided emotional support to residents. In a report on September\u00a018, they noted that residents in Coulibistrie remained in a state of shock for weeks after Erika, with many struggling to begin the recovery process.[75] The Ministry of Health highlighted concerns over post-storm diseases, particularly from mosquitoes, due to a major increase in the usage of water storage containers.[76] An outbreak of Gastroenteritis ensued in the weeks following Erika, with 153\u00a0cases confirmed by September\u00a022. Cases were primarily in Portsmouth, Saint Joseph, and Roseau.[77] A unique means of supplying food and water the communities of Boetica and Delices, only accessible by air due to a gorge 260\u00a0ft (80\u00a0m) wide and 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) deep, was established in the form of a zip-line in late-September. This served as the primary means of aid until a 98\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) Bailey bridge was constructed.[78] By April\u00a02016, the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation projects  reached EC$7\u00a0million (US$3\u00a0million).[79] Supplementing reconstruction efforts by China and the United Kingdom, the nation's government allocated a further EC$30\u00a0million (US$11\u00a0million) to enhancing road safety.[80] The Food and Agriculture Organization allocated EC$300,000 (US$110,000) for farmers in October.[81] Through June\u00a02016, the government provided victims with EC$5\u20136\u00a0million (US$1.8\u20132.2\u00a0million), primarily to cover shelters and food.[82]"

More than 20\u00a0tonnes of water and 5.3\u00a0tonnes of food were provided by RFA Lyme Bay.[93] The Governments of the British Virgin Islands and Taiwan each pledged US$100,000 in funds.[94][95] Digicel and LIME coordinated restoration efforts to the nation's fiber-optic networks.[96] The former requested donations from 32\u00a0countries while the latter assisted in establishing supply routes to isolated communities.[97] Digical also partnered with the Dominican Red Cross, paying for transportation so relief teams could access isolated towns.[98] The Government of the Cayman Islands donated US$500,000 and requested residents of the territory to donate supplies.[99] Japan's government provided US$100,000-worth of generators, water purifiers, and water tanks through the Japan International Cooperation Agency.[100] Japan later signed a US1.6\u00a0million grant for disaster resilience supplies in January\u00a02016.[101] A further TT$5\u00a0million (US$784,000) was provided by Trinidad and Tobago.[102] The Government of Guyana provided a shipment of 68\u00a0tonnes of rice collected through public and private donations, three times more than targeted.[103] Through its Excess Rainfall Programme, the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility provided \u20ac6.5\u00a0million (US$2.4\u00a0million) to the Government of Dominica\u2014the maximum payout allowable.[104] Thousands of school supplies, including books and writing utensils, were collected by the Caribbean Community.[105] The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), All Hands Volunteers, Convoy of Hope, ChildFund, and the Organization of American States also provided assistance.[106] The initial response from UNICEF included the distribution of over 600\u00a0hygiene kits and 4,000\u00a0water purification tablets.[55] Logistical support, namely satellite phones, solar chargers, and laptops, were provided by the International Telecommunication Union.[107] Four tonnes of medical supplies provided by the PAHO arrived on September\u00a09,[108] and the Government of Brazil supplied additional medical items in October.[109] After an initial release of funds on September\u00a03, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched an emergency appeal on September\u00a010 for approximately US$1\u00a0million to assist 12,000\u00a0people.[110] The society's relief operation lasted until April\u00a010, 2016, and provided 12,382\u00a0people with life-saving assistance. The IFRC's primary goal was to restore access to clean water; more than half a million litres of water was provided during the seven-month operation. In regards to health, psychosocial support was made available to 873\u00a0people, roughly half of the original goal. Hygiene awareness and distribution of kits proved successful, with all 1,000\u00a0kits supplied to those in need. The Dominican Red Cross mass-promoted the Red Cross First Aid mobile app to 8,000\u00a0phones, though only 399 people downloaded it. Cash grants of US$334\u2014by way of Visa debit cards\u2014were provided to 279\u00a0families to cover lost property. A total of 1,000\u00a0mattresses were provided to survivors and a request for additional beds was made; however, limited funds prevented fulfillment.[111] In March\u00a02017, the CDEMA approved a \u20ac9.6\u00a0million (US$10.5\u00a0million) plan to address gaps in Dominica's disaster response legislation uncovered during the response to Erika.[112]"

Parliamentary Representative Kenneth Darroux pleaded with residents to be understanding and patient with those whom were displaced.[114] Plans for a new settlement were established in February\u00a02016, with plans to build 500\u20131,000\u00a0homes.[113] The government provided displaced residents with EC$1,000 per family to handle rent.[115] Similarly, all residents of Dubique were forced to evacuate; they were relocated to temporary homes in Grand Bay provided by Venezuela.[113] Ten two- and three-bedroom homes were provided by the ADRA. Costs for resettlement and reconstruction exceeded EC$91\u00a0million (US$14.3\u00a0million).[116] Power was restored to all areas of the nation, except for Petite Savanne and Dubique, by September\u00a028.[117] Restoration to the nation's water system was completed in January\u00a02016; however, permanent systems were still to be constructed.[118] French organizations provided  \u20ac70,000 (US$77,000) for the reconstruction of two schools.[119] Repair of Douglas\u2013Charles airport was deemed a priority, though the first phase of rehabilitation for runways and aprons took more than a year to complete. In addition to repairs, greater flood defense systems were implemented, including dredging, flood walls, and river training.[120] Construction of 25\u00a0planned homes by the ADRA began in February\u00a02016, with projected completion in 2017; 50\u00a0volunteers were involved in the project.[121] In April\u00a02016, a library built in 1902 was converted into the \"Post Erika Reconstruction Center\", spearheaded by Baroness Patricia Scotland.[122] Contracts for roadway repairs between St. Joseph and Layou were signed that month.[115] In November\u00a02016, Dominica signed an agreement with the European Union for an \u20ac8.9\u00a0million (US$9.6\u00a0million) rehabilitation project.[123] In a join Dominica\u2013United Kingdom project, a new road from Loubiere to Bagatelle in southeastern Dominica was announced in March\u00a02017. The EC$100\u00a0million (US$37\u00a0million) plan would ensure the road could handle heavy rain events, with 12\u201314\u00a0culverts and 3\u00a0bridges. Furthermore, road edge failure issues were to be addressed.[124] On September\u00a018\u201319, 2017, Hurricane Maria struck Dominica as a Category\u00a05 hurricane, the first such storm of that intensity on record in the nation.[125] An estimated 98\u00a0percent of the island's structures were damaged or destroyed and agriculture was devastated.[126] The Assessment Capacities Project estimated total losses of EC$3.69\u00a0billion (US$1.37\u00a0billion), equal to 226 percent of Dominica's 2016 GDP.[127] A total of 65\u00a0fatalities have been confirmed across the island, including 34 who are missing and presumed to be dead.[128]"

        "content": "On 8 January 2003, lightning strikes started four fires in New South Wales, over the border but in close proximity to Canberra. Despite their proximity and very small initial sizes, low intensity, and low rate of spread, these fires were not extinguished or contained by New South Wales emergency services personnel. Subsequent inquiries into the bushfires, including the Roche report, the McLeod inquiry, and the Coroners Report, identified poor management of the initial response as a key contributor to the disaster that unfolded on 18 January 2003. On 13 January, a Bell Jet Ranger helicopter that had been waterbombing the fires in the forests west of Canberra crashed into Bendora Dam with one person, pilot Duncan Patrick, injured. The pilot was reloading water buckets from the dam at the time of the crash. ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and ACT Chief Fire Control Officer Peter Lucas-Smith were reviewing the fires nearby during a routine bushfire surveillance flight in the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter. The unconscious pilot had been pulled from the sinking wreckage by a SouthCare rescue helicopter medical crewman Euan McKenzie, but due to the weight of his clothes and lack of life vest, was unable to be dragged from the water.[2][3] The pilot of the Southcare chopper cautiously positioned his aircraft to allow Stanhope, Lucas-Smith and a paramedic on board to dive into the dam and bring the injured pilot about 60 metres to shore for resuscitation by Lucas-Smith and McKenzie.[4][5][6][7] The pilot had head injuries and underwent emergency surgery at Canberra Hospital.[8] Both Stanhope and Lucas-Smith received the Royal Life Saving Society's rescue medal to commemorate their bravery in the rescue. McKenzie received the society's highest award, the Bravery Cross,[9] which recognises undertaking a rescue in an aquatic environment under circumstances that endanger the rescuer's life.[10] On 17 January, the Emergency Services Bureau (ESB) released its final media release prior to 18 January, at 8:50\u00a0pm.[11] This media release differed to any previous one in format and content. It also provided several clues that were overlooked in the assessment of the risk Canberra faced. For example, one point of the release stated that bushfire logistical support staging areas were being relocated from Bulls Head and Orroral Valley (far outside urban Canberra) to the North Curtin District Playing Fields (far inside urban Canberra),[12] signalling both a major retreat by fire fighters and pointing to imminent danger to the city itself."

        "content": "The morning of Saturday 18 January 2003 was hot, windy and dry. Temperatures as high as 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) and winds exceeding 80 kilometres per hour (50 miles per hour), plus a very low relative humidity, were the main weather features of the day. Two fires continued to burn out of control in the Namadgi National Park, with the entire park, along with the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, being closed due to the threat. A second fire, in the Brindabella Ranges, was threatening to break containment lines. By 9\u00a0am on the morning of Saturday 18 January, burned leaves appeared on lawns in houses in the Weston Creek, Kambah, and Tuggeranong suburbs bordering the western extremity of Canberra. By 10\u00a0am, news helicopters were overflying Duffy and reporting news of the fires interstate and internationally. Throughout the day, the fires burned closer to the fringes of Canberra's suburbs, and there was no sign of authorities gaining control of the situation. At around 2\u00a0pm, police evacuated the township of Tharwa to the south of Canberra. By mid-afternoon, it had become apparent that the fires posed an immediate threat to the settlements near Canberra, such as Uriarra and Stromlo, as well as to the houses on the city's urban-bushland interface. A state of emergency was declared at 2.45\u00a0pm by the ACT's Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope. The fires reached the urban area at 3\u00a0pm. The first emergency warning advisories were broadcast shortly after, on radio and television, with the advisories updated throughout the day. These advisories, accompanied by the Emergency Warning Signal stated that a significant \"deterioration\" of the fire situation in the ACT had occurred and placed several suburbs on alert to evacuate. As the day continued, these advisories advised the evacuation of several suburbs (also enforced by Police on the ground) and placed most suburbs of Canberra on some level of alert. By now, the fire had reached the fringes of many suburbs, was surrounding Tharwa, and threatened the historic Lanyon Homestead, which was hosting a wedding and protected by only a single fire truck. By 3.50\u00a0pm, some houses were alight in the suburbs of Duffy and Chapman, with the loss of a home in Holder soon after. An ACT Fire Brigade unit, perceiving the fire from a vantage point in Fyshwick, overrode instructions by the radio controller to ignore the signs and remain where they were. The unit headed to Duffy, attempting to alert both controllers and residents to the imminent danger. That unit was caught in a fire front on Warragamba Avenue Duffy at around 4.10\u00a0pm, after having rescued at least two residents. Both the crew and residents were forced to flee the appliance when the fire struck. Due to fire damage to infrastructure and extreme winds bringing down powerlines across the area, large parts of the city lost power. Fires also started in Giralang because of powerline problems. Evacuation centres were set up at four schools \u2013 Canberra College, UC Senior Secondary  College Lake Ginninderra (then Lake Ginninderra College), Erindale College, and Narrabundah College. A dark cloud hung over the city, and, although it was not in danger, Parliament House was closed. By 5\u00a0pm, houses were reported destroyed in Duffy, Chapman, Kambah, Holder, and Rivett, as well as in the small forestry settlement of Uriarra. It was later found that the first casualty of the fires, an elderly woman named Dorothy McGrath, had died at the nearby Stromlo Forestry Settlement.[13] Escape for residents was hampered by poor warning and by the settlement's location, surrounded by the pine forest. Fires in the Michelago area forced the closure of the Monaro Highway into Canberra. Fires spread through the Kambah Pool area and into the suburb of Kambah, causing damage to many homes and one of the ACT's primary Urban and Rural fire stations. Fire spread through parkland, crossing the Tuggeranong Parkway and Sulwood Drive finally engulfing Mount Taylor. Within an hour, houses were also burning in Torrens, on the slopes of Mount Taylor, and in Weston. The fires by now had inflicted severe damage to the city's infrastructure. Power supplies were cut to several suburbs. These outages affected both the Emergency Services Bureau's own headquarters in Curtin and the Canberra Hospital (running on back-up generators), which was under intense pressure from people suffering burns and smoke inhalation. In Curtin, the ESA headquarters was in danger from the fires. With back-up power available only to the Communications Centre, many personnel were forced to work on tables outside as Army Reserve personnel hosed down the building.[14] It was later noted that the ESB could have moved its operations away from danger to other emergency service locations such as the AFP Winchester Centre or Tuggeranong Police Station.[14] Water, gas, sewerage, and communications were heavily affected. Water, gas, and landline communications was unavailable to several suburbs due to damage to supply lines and city reservoirs. Mobile telecommunications were severely affected due to increased traffic, causing serious disruption to mobile phone networks and the ESA's own radio and dispatch networks. A local generator services business later reported on their website that the ash and smoke were so intense, that some back-up power diesel generators at communication and data centres failed to produce enough power due to air intake filters clogging up. At least one generator air intake filter burned as it sucked in burning leaves blowing in the strong winds. The fires impacted part of the Lower Molonglo Water Quality Control Centre (LMWQCC), responsible for treating the city's sewage and waste water before its release into the Molonglo River. The plant's operations were disrupted due to fire damage, causing concern about the possible release of sewage into the Molonglo River, as the plant's reserve storage could only hold one day of surplus. However, the lack of resources and equipment failures for crews protecting the plant could have led to a catastrophe, as detailed in Danny Camilleri's testimony in Coroner Maria Doogan's subsequent inquest into the fires.  Camilleri testified that his crews arrived to find much of the area around the plant on fire, with a significant risk of the fire endangering dangerous substances stored at the plant to treat waste, including chlorine.[15] He stated that if the fire had caused a breach in the chlorine tanks, it would have created \"a poisonous cloud that would blow toward Canberra necessitating mass evacuations\".[15] By 10\u00a0pm, one of the four evacuation centres in Canberra was completely full, and the others were filling up quickly. Reports of looting also began to arrive from the damaged areas. Both Prime Minister John Howard and Governor General Peter Hollingworth changed their plans to return to Canberra as soon as was possible.[clarification needed] While the very worst of the fires had passed, the situation was still far from stable, and going into Sunday, 19 January, houses were still ablaze across numerous suburbs."

        "content": "By the evening of 19 January, it was clear that the worst-hit suburb was Duffy, where 200+ residences were destroyed,[16] and that four people had died: Alison Tener, 38, Peter Brooke, 74, and Douglas Fraser, 60, and Dorothy McGrath, 76, of the Mount Stromlo Forestry Settlement.[17][18] The loss of life, damage to property, and destruction of forests to the west of the city caused not just economic loss but significant social impacts. Bushfires severely harmed the vegetation of the Cotter River Catchment and caused water quality problems in the three dams in the catchment: Corin, Bendora and Cotter Dams. For quite some time after the fires, turbidity in the water due to silt and ash from surrounding burnt-out forests meant Canberra had to rely on Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River, which was not affected by the fires. Given the drought and existing water shortages, this effectively reduced Canberra's water reserves to around 15% for some time. An upgrade to the Stromlo Water Treatment Plant was subsequently required to allow extra filtration of water to cope with the diminished quality in the future. As with any bushfire, the environment will take significant time to regenerate. Regeneration of vegetation was delayed by an ongoing drought in the region."

Instrumentation and engineering workshops, the observatory's library, and the main administration buildings were consumed. The visitors' centre or \"Exploratory\" housing public exhibits and cafe escaped the fires unscathed, despite being on the edge of a steep gradient, which fires had roared up, and being only metres from the 74-inch (1.88\u00a0m) telescope, which was completely destroyed. The insurance payment sought by the Australian National University (ANU), amounting to 75 million Australian dollars, could have become the largest insurance claim in Australian history. However, in August 2009, during trial in the ACT Supreme Court, the three insurance companies settled out of court, paying the ANU an undisclosed sum.[20] A related claim against ANU's insurance broker, Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd, for failing to renew insurance coverage on some structures, was also settled for an unstated amount in June 2011.[21] Canberra artist Tim Wetherell was commissioned by ANU[22] to produce a sculpture from the ruins of the Mount Stromlo telescopes.  The finished sculpture was named \"The Astronomer\" and installed in the Parliamentary Triangle, outside Questacon."

The memorial was designed by Canberra artists Tess Horwitz, Tony Steel and Martyn Jolly and incorporates elements requested by the ACT community. It is a journey from the day of the fire, through the process of recovery, to the honouring of memory. The entrance memorial walls are made from the community's salvaged bricks, which are inscribed with messages of grief and gratitude. Beyond the walls, a site framed by a grove of casuarinas contains red glass and metal forms, referring to the force of the firestorm and to the lightning strikes that sparked the main fires. An avenue leads to an amphitheatre enclosing a pond and bubbling spring. Glass columns bordering the pond contain details from photos provided by the community which speak of memory and human resilience. On 18 February 2006, an independent group of fire victims installed a plaque to honour the four people who died in the fires and the volunteer firefighters who fought so hard. The plaque is located at the end of the walkway to the memorial, immediately before the memorial walls. Fire victims and residents held a simple ceremony to mark the occasion."

It severely disrupted the 13th World Scout Jamboree, which was being held in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture. The twentieth depression, nineteenth named storm, and twelfth typhoon of the 1971 Pacific typhoon season, the system was first noted as an area of circulation in a near-equatorial trough, located to the east of Guam on July 24. After moving through the area, the system took a northward direction due to the influence of a trough. It then commenced a northeast move before organizing, though it didn't strengthen to a tropical depression until July 29. Slow but gradual intensification occurred, becoming a tropical storm in the early hours of July 31 as it moved to the west, before taking a north-northwest track as it intensified to a typhoon on August 2 while approaching the Ryukyu Islands. On the next day, it reached its peak intensity of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and an unusually low barometric pressure of 935 mbar, equivalent to a mid-level typhoon as it started to batter the third-largest island of Japan, Kyushu. It then moved to the north, while weakening back to a minimal typhoon before making landfall on the area, with the records pointing it to the east of Nagasaki on August 5. It rapidly weakened while traversing Kyushu, before entering the Sea of Japan. At this time, it passed near the southern part of Korea before curving to the northeast. It then passed near Russian Manchuria before weakening below gale-force, shortly before becoming extratropical as it passed through the La P\u00e9rouse Strait on August 9. It then accelerated through the Pacific Ocean before dissipating on the next day. 90 deaths were attributed from Olive, with the majority in Japan. The system also caused widespread flooding and landslides through the country and nearby South Korea. The total damages are unknown."

Delfina weakened while moving inland, and it was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January\u00a01, 2003. However, its remnants moved across the country and into Malawi, later looping around and crossing back over Mozambique; the remnants of Delfina were last observed on January\u00a09. In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000\u00a0houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief efforts in the aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops in the midst of an ongoing food shortage.

The system had a weak circulation, located in an area of minimal wind shear. At 1200\u00a0UTC that day, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France[nb 2] classified the system as the sixth zone of disturbed weather of the season.[3] It quickly developed,[4] organizing into Tropical Disturbance 6 at 1800\u00a0UTC on December\u00a030.[5] At around the same time, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 08S.[4] The convection became better organized, developing outflow and rainbands.[3] With a ridge to the south, the storm tracked in a generally westward direction toward Mozambique.[6] At 0600\u00a0UTC on December\u00a031, MFR upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 6, and six hours later the agency upgraded it to Tropical Storm Delfina.[5] While approaching the Mozambique coastline, Delfina quickly intensified, developing en eye feature and reaching maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[6] At 1800\u00a0UTC on December\u00a031, MFR estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[5] At about 2130\u00a0UTC, Delfina made landfall near Angoche in eastern Mozambique.[6] It rapidly weakened while moving inland, and MFR discontinued advisories early on January\u00a01, 2003.[5] Delfina entered Malawi on January\u00a02, where dry air affected the storm. The remnants turned to the northeast, drifting into Mozambique and later turning to the south.

A station in Nampula reported 281\u00a0mm (11.1\u00a0in) in a 48\u2011hour period.[3] Delfina washed out roads and bridges in Nampula and Zambezia provinces,[9] which isolated towns and disrupted the transportation network.[10][11] A train derailed due to effects from the storm, which cut rail travel between northern Mozambique and neighboring Malawi.[10] The cyclone destroyed or severely damaged over 18,000\u00a0houses,[11] which directly affected about 133,000\u00a0people, mostly in Nampula where 22,000\u00a0people were displaced.[12] Floods along the Ligonha River forced 1,800\u00a0people to leave their homes.[11] In Nampula and Zambezia, Delfina damaged four health facilities and 376\u00a0schools.[12] The storm caused a power outage in Nampula for several days, and in Monapo, there were water shortages after the storm.[11] The cyclone destroyed over 2,000\u00a0ha (4,900 acres) of beans and cassava crops and knocked down thousands of cashew trees,[11] in areas already affected by food shortages due to drought conditions.[13] Overall, Delfina resulted in $3.5\u00a0million in damage (2003\u00a0USD),[4] and caused 47\u00a0deaths in the country,[13] at least 19 due to flooding.[14] After Delfina moved through Mozambique, the local Red Cross chapter provided shelter, water, and relief items to the affected residents.[11] Residual flooding in northern Mozambique, compounded with lack of drinking water, caused a cholera outbreak that affected at least 400\u00a0people. By January\u00a027, 12\u00a0people had died from the disease.[15] Flooding also caused a malaria outbreak that killed 45\u00a0people in the country.[14] Government officials deployed food to the affected areas by airplane and by road, after workers repaired damaged bridges.[15] Residents in Mozambique gradually recovered from storm damage in the weeks after it struck.[16] Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas.[13] In neighboring Malawi, the storm's remnants caused flooding in seven provinces,[10] although it was not widespread.[17] Delfina damaged roads, and destroyed one rail bridge in Balaka District.[10] The storm destroyed about 3,600\u00a0houses;[18] which forced about 30,000\u00a0people to leave their homes.[19] The floods affected 57,000\u00a0properties, damaging 23,500\u00a0ha (58,000 acres) in the midst of a food shortage.[10][18] Delfina killed eight people in Malawi,[3] prompting President Bakili Muluzi to declare the country as a disaster area on January\u00a011.[19] After the storm, the Red Cross provided blankets and food for the affected residents.[17] The damaged rail line that initially prevented relief supplies from entering the country was repaired in early February.[20]"

        "content": " Tropical Depression Eight caused severe flooding in southeastern Texas in late August 1981. The twelfth tropical cyclone of the annual hurricane season, the depression developed from a tropical disturbance over the Bay of Campeche on August\u00a026. Moving northwestward, the cyclone failed to intensify into a tropical storm before making landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas to the north of Tampico on August\u00a028, with winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h). After moving inland, the depression curved north-northwestward before degenerating into a surface low pressure area near the Mexico\u2013United States border on August\u00a029. The remnants moved eastward across Texas and entered Louisiana before dissipating on September\u00a01. Although the system was only a surface low upon reaching Texas, a large thunderstorm complex developed near its center on August\u00a029. This resulted in heavy rainfall across southeastern Texas, with a peak total of 21\u00a0in (530\u00a0mm) in Pine Springs, with much of that falling in only about six hours. One of the hardest hit areas was Lavaca County. At least 15\u00a0streets in downtown Hallettsville were flooded, damaging hundreds of cars, 150 to 200\u00a0homes, 75\u00a0businesses, and a few local government buildings. Five people were killed by floodwaters in Shiner. Throughout Lavaca County, more than 286\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed, 17\u00a0bridges and several roads were washed out, and hundreds of head of cattle were drowned. The depression spawned 14\u00a0tornadoes, one of which caused extensive damage in the Galveston area. Overall, the depression left five fatalities and more than $56.2\u00a0million (1981\u00a0USD) in damage.[nb 1]"

At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km) west of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The cyclone moved northwestward and strengthened slightly to peak with maximum sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,004\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg) at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027.[1] The National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Eight until 22:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, after satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the system was a tropical depression.[2] Shortly after 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, the depression made landfall in Tamaulipas about 45\u00a0mi (70\u00a0km) north of Tampico. About six hours later,[1] the cyclone degenerated into a weak surface low pressure area just south of the Rio Grande.[3] The low entered Texas on August\u00a030 and moved northeastward and then east-northeastward due to an upper-level trough.[4] While crossing the far eastern side of the state, the remnant low resumed its northeastward motion before entering Louisiana and dissipating on September\u00a01.[3]"

In Aransas Pass, a waterspout spawned over Redfish Bay moved ashore and destroyed a mobile home, deroofed a fishing lodge, and toppled electrical poles and power lines before lifting. In Live Oak County near Three Rivers, a tornado crossed a uranium mining business headquarters, extensively damaging a warehouse and an office. A few people received minor injuries. In a rural area of Bee County, a tornado demolished a mobile homes and a barn, unroofed another home, and downed several electrical poles. A tornado in Galveston shattered several windows, damaged some planes, and deroofed a few hangars at the Scholes International Airport, where the tornado produced a wind gust of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h). The twister also severed a major power line; extensively damaged a fire station and a warehouse; and damaged or deroofed several homes and buildings, including at the Strand Historic District. Before lifting, the tornado tossed several 18-wheel trucks and damaged a pier at the Port of Galveston after a 450\u00a0ft (140\u00a0m) freighter broke loose.[4] After entering Texas, a large thunderstorm complex developed near the center of the system on August\u00a029. As a result, heavy rainfall fell in a roughly 50 by 200\u00a0mi (80 by 322\u00a0km) area between Seguin and Houston.

They began when excessive rains began falling in March, leading to massive flooding and landslides. They caused more than 430 deaths, notably in Kenya and Rwanda. In the fall another round of floods hit the African Sahel.[1][2] Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas. Disastrous floods have caused millions of fatalities in the twentieth century, tens of billions of dollars of direct economic loss each year, and significant disruption to global trade.[3]"

Dot originated from a small area of thunderstorm activity in early to mid October. The system was first classified on October\u00a011, and steadily intensified over the next few days. Dot attained typhoon strength on October\u00a015, and subsequently entered a period of explosive deepening, which was not anticipated by forecasters. The next day the intensification rate slowed, but that evening, Dot attained its maximum intensify. A steady weakening trend began on October\u00a017, though the system maintained typhoon intensity through the passage of the Philippines. After entering the South China Sea late on October\u00a018, Dot briefly re-intensified, only to weaken as it approached Vietnam. On October\u00a021, Dot struck Vietnam while still a typhoon, but dissipated the next day over the high terrain of the nation. Although damage across the Philippines was less than initially expected, the typhoon lashed the nation with heavy rains. Province of Nueva Ecija suffered the worst effects from Dot. There, 500,000 acres (200,000\u00a0ha) of crops and 90%\u00a0of all buildings were damaged. In Cabanatuan, 2,500\u00a0homes and 90%\u00a0of structures were destroyed. Overall, 42\u00a0towns were flooded, forcing a total of 125,000\u00a0people to flee their homes, 35,000\u00a0of which were homeless. Furthermore, 52,933\u00a0houses were leveled while an additional 200,450\u00a0were damaged. Nationwide, 24\u00a0were hurt. While tracking through the South China Sea, Dot passed through Hainan Island. There, two casualties occurred while 34\u00a0others suffered injuries. Across the island, over 2,300\u00a0dwellings were destroyed. In all, Dot was responsible for 90\u00a0deaths and $104.9\u00a0million (1985\u00a0USD) in damage."

        "content": "Following the extratropical transition of Typhoon Brenda on October\u00a05, a mid-level subtropical ridge became centered over the northwestern Pacific, which resulted in an absence of the typical southwesterly monsoon flow typically seen during the autumn. Satellite imagery first detected an area of convection roughly 280\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) southeast of Ponape on October\u00a011.[1] At 1200\u00a0UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first identified the system.[2][nb 1] The next day, the storm's outflow became better defined as the storm tracked west-northwest. On October\u00a013, wind shear began to decrease, and the cyclone developed a well-defined circulation. Based on this, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the system into Tropical Storm Dot.[1][nb 2] That evening, the JMA followed suit.[2] The newly upgraded Dot was situated in an area of strong easterly winds, and thus the JTWC correctly predicted to the system to continue west-northwest, despite forecasts from various tropical cyclone forecast models that showed otherwise.[1] Dot steadily strengthened during this period, and midday on October\u00a014, the JMA classified Dot as a severe tropical storm.[2] Several hours later, the JTWC upgraded Dot into a typhoon, with the JMA following early on October\u00a015.[5] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Saling.[6] Shortly after attaining typhoon intensity, Dot entered a period of explosive intensification. However, this was not expected by forecasters at the JTWC nor the forecast models due to the presence of dry air.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, the JTWC revised the intensity to 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), equivalent to a mid-level Category\u00a02 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). That evening, the JMA increased the intensity of Dot to 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), making it the strongest tropical cyclone of the season.[5] At 2300\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, Hurricane Hunters measured a minimum barometric pressure of 906\u00a0mbar (26.8\u00a0inHg), a drop of 63\u00a0mbar (1.9\u00a0inHg) over the previous 23\u00a0hours, equal to a drop 2.8\u00a0mbar (0.083\u00a0inHg) per hour. This rate exceeded the threshold of explosive intensification, which according to the JTWC, is 2.5\u00a0mbar (0.074\u00a0inHg) per hour.[1] Based on the aforementioned aircraft reports, the JTWC increased the intensity to 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) at 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016. By this time, Dot had developed a well-defined eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops.[5] However, the JTWC also noted that both the storm's radius of maximum winds and central dense overcast were unusually small.[1] By October\u00a016, Dot's rate of deepening had leveled off.[1] At midday, the JTWC estimated that Dot attained peak intensity of 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph)[5] while the JMA placed the storm's wind speed at 220\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph).[2] After maintaining this intensity until the morning of October 17, Dot started a gradual weakening trend[5] while passing directly over Samar Island and encountering increased wind shear. Around this time, radar imagery showed that Dot displayed a small pinhole eye 5 to 8\u00a0km (3.1 to 5.0\u00a0mi) in diameter.[1] On the afternoon of October\u00a018, the typhoon made landfall along southern Luzon. At this time, the JTWC reported an intensity of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and the JMA assigned the storm's intensity at 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[5] That evening, Dot re-emerged into the South China Sea while still at typhoon intensity. Continuing west-northwest, Dot quickly became better organized. According to the JTWC, Dot reaches its secondary peak intensity of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) midday on October\u00a020 while situated roughly 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Hong Kong.[1] Meanwhile, the JMA raised the storm's intensity to 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[2] Also around this time, the typhoon exited PAGASA's warning zone.[7] After brushing Hainan Island, Dot resumed weakening. Early on October\u00a021, Dot moved ashore in northern Vietnam, around 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) south of Hanoi.[1] At the time of its second landfall, the JTWC estimate Dot's intensity at 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph), while the JMA estimate was lower, at 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[5] Land interaction with the high terrain of the nation resulted in rapid weakening, and by 0000\u00a0UTC October\u00a022, the JTWC ceased tracking Dot.[1] The JMA followed suit 12 hours later.[2]"

Additionally, railway and shipping services were cancelled.[9] All United States military installations in the Philippines were placed in a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness[1] and two airbases, Clark Air Base and Cubi Point NAS, were evacuated.[11] Schools and many offices were shut down in preparation of Dot.[12] Typhoon Dot was the strongest tropical cyclone to directly strike the Bicol Region of the Philippines since Typhoon Irma in 1981.[13] Although the storm brought heavy rains to much of Philippines,[14] damage was less than initially expected[15] due to the storm's small size.[1] In Davao Del Sur, 10\u00a0people were killed and several homes were destroyed due to mudslides.[16] A man was swept away in a landslide in Legaspi,[17] which also forced the evacuation of 165\u00a0families.[18] The worst effects of the storm were felt in Nueva. There, 202,345\u00a0ha (500,000 acres) of crops and 90%\u00a0of all buildings were damaged,[16] totaling to $5.3\u00a0million (1985\u00a0USD).[19] Offshore, three people were killed and 16\u00a0others were rendered missing when a cargo ship sunk.[16] Seven fatalities occurred in Cabanatuan,[20] where 2,500\u00a0homes were demolished[21] and 22,000\u00a0were damaged.[22] Ninety percent of all infrastructure was destroyed.[19] Flooding in low-lying areas of Manila forced the evacuation of 29,000. Elsewhere, 69,000\u00a0houses were flooded in Pampanga, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija.[23] In all, 42\u00a0towns were flooded,[24] which forced a total of 125,000\u00a0people to flee their homes,[25] 35,000\u00a0of which were homeless.[19] Overall, 52,933\u00a0homes were destroyed while an additional 200,450\u00a0were damaged. Throughout the Philippines, 24\u00a0people were hurt,[26] and 88\u00a0perished,[27] and over 1\u00a0million people were directly affected.[26] Nationwide, damage totaled $104.9\u00a0million. This included $92.8 million in property damage and less than $1\u00a0million in agriculture.[7] During the aftermath of the storm, the governor of Nueva Ecija requested President Ferdinand Marcos to declare the province a disaster area.[28] Additionally, UNICEF was asked to provide water-purifying tablets. The Philippine Red Cross, Philippine government, local authorities and civic organizations provided relief assistance in the immediate aftermath of the storm. Despite private appeals for up to $1.4\u00a0million for reconstruction aid, the Philippine government did not submit a request for international aid. However, by October 25, eight non-government relief agencies provided relief, which totaled $1.15\u00a0million. Furthermore, the government of Switzerland provided $8,061\u00a0worth of aid.[26] After passing the Philippines, Typhoon Dot skirted Hainan Island, leaving two dead. Communications were lost in Sanya, the southernmost city in the island.[29] Thirty-four were hurt. A total of 50,000 homes and 83,000 acres of farmland were flooded.[30] More than 2,300\u00a0houses also collapsed.[1] Along the China mainland, heavy rains were recorded, although damage was minor.[29]"

Phanfone started as a large area of convection well west of the International Date Line. The system was well organized and classified as Tropical Depression 18W on September 29. At the same day, it gained the name Phanfone due to very favorable conditions and intense thunderstorms rich with convection surrounding the storm's center. Phanfone would later go rapid intensification on October 1 due to warm sea-surface temperatures and very favorable environments. JTWC upgraded Phanfone to a Category 4 typhoon but weakened later back to Category 3 due to its eye replacing the old one and undergoing a minor eyewall replacement cycle. Phanfone later entered the PAR, assigning the name Neneng. It left several hours later, maintaining its Category 3 strength. On October 4, Phanfone reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 super typhoon before steadily weakening. The typhoon later made landfall at Hamamatsu, Japan at the time of its extratropical transition. The system later moved over Southwestern Alaska and dissipated on October 12."

        "content": "Early on September 29, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, shortly before the JMA also upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Phanfone.[2][3] Tracking along the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge, the storm intensified very slowly for two days, although conditions remained favorable. Late on September 30, the JMA upgraded Phanfone to a severe tropical storm, right before the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon.[4][5] After the JMA also upgraded Phanfone to a typhoon at noon on October 1, the system started to deepen more rapidly when tracking along the southwestern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge.[6] Under low vertical wind shear and good dual channel outflow enhanced by the mid-latitude westerlies to the north, Phanfone formed a pinhole eye early on October 2.[7] According to the JMA, Phanfone reached peak intensity with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) at 06:00 UTC, and it also became equivalent to the category 4 strength on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[8][9] Soon, the eye became cloud-filled and formed a secondary eyewall, suggesting an eyewall replacement cycle.[10] The PAGASA named the typhoon Neneng when it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility early on October 3.[11] In addition, Phanfone formed a ragged and large eye, indicating the completion of the eyewall replacement cycle.[12] Early on October 4, the JTWC upgraded Phanfone to a super typhoon when it was located about 170\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Minamidait\u014djima. As the system started to tap into the mid-latitude westerlies, it was in an area of strong vertical wind shear offset by vigorous outflow, namely the improved poleward channel.[13] Only six hours later, the JTWC downgraded Phanfone back to a typhoon owing to the loosening spiral banding.[14] At noon, the JMA analysed that Phanfone started to weaken.[15] The convective tops of the system intermittently warmed up afterwards, but the ragged and large eye still maintained well.[16] Phanfone sharply recurved and accelerated northeastward early on the next day, tracking along the western edge of the deep-layered subtropical ridge.[17] Typhoon Phanfone passed near the southern coast of Kii Peninsula around 03:00 JST on October 6 (18:00 UTC on October 5).[18] The eye immediately dissipated, as well as the system started to undergo extratropical transition right before making landfall near Hamamatsu of the Shizuoka Prefecture in Japan after 08:00 JST (23:00 UTC on October 5).[19] The JTWC issued the final warning to Phanfone early on October 6, and the system completely became extratropical at noon.[20][21] The storm stopped weakening and began to deepen again early on October 7, and it crossed the International Date Line as a powerful extratropical cyclone early the next day.[22] Post-Tropical Cyclone Phanfone, which was located about 890\u00a0km (555\u00a0mi) southwest of Unalaska, Alaska, reached peak intensity of its extratropical period at noon on October 8, with a barometric pressure of 948 hPa (27.99 inHg) and hurricane-force winds.[23] The system started to weaken again early on October 9, and it turned northward early on October 11.[24][25] The system eventually moved inland over Southcentral Alaska early on October 12 and dissipated later that day.[26][27]"

High waves and winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) were reported most in southern Japan.[34] At the Kadena Air Base, the typhoon killed a U.S. airman and left two others missing after they were swept out to sea.[35] It was also reported that 10 people were injured and nearly 10,000 houses were without power.[36] On October 5, Phanfone also affected the Formula One 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall which made the track surface wet and significantly reduced visibility. Because of this, the race had to be red flagged twice; the first time because the torrential rain made conditions too treacherous to race in and the second time because of a fatal accident involving Jules Bianchi, which was partially caused by the wet track conditions.[37][38] In Japan, a total of eleven people were killed by the typhoon, with several others missing or injured.[39] Heavy rains from the typhoon worsened the spread of radioactive materials in groundwater around the Fukushima I and Fukushima II nuclear power plants, which suffered nuclear meltdowns in 2011 following a MW9.0\u00a0earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Levels of the radioactive hydrogen isotope tritium soared ten-fold from the previous month to 150,000\u00a0becquerels per liter. Strontium-90, a substance known to cause bone cancer, rose to a record 1.2\u00a0million becquerels per liter.

        "content": " Tropical Storm Helene was a long-lived tropical cyclone that oscillated for ten days between a tropical wave and a 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) tropical storm. It was the twelfth tropical cyclone and eighth tropical storm of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, forming on September 15 east of the Windward Islands. After degenerating into a tropical wave, the system produced flooding and mudslides in Puerto Rico. It reformed into a tropical depression on September 19 south of Cuba, and crossed the western portion of the island the next day while on the verge of dissipation. However, it intensified into a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, reaching its peak intensity while approaching the northern Gulf Coast. The storm rapidly weakened before moving ashore near Fort Walton Beach, Florida on September 22. It produced heavy rainfall along the Florida Panhandle that reached 9.56\u00a0in (243\u00a0mm). The rains flooded hundreds of houses and caused the Sopchoppy River to reach a record crest. Gusty winds left about 5,000\u00a0people without power, though the rains alleviated drought conditions. In South Carolina, Helene spawned a tornado that killed one person and injured six others; heavy rainfall in the state also led to a death when a driver hydroplaned into a tree. The rainfall extended northeastward into Delaware. Overall damage in the United States was estimated at $16\u00a0million. Helene emerged from North Carolina as a tropical storm, and re-intensified to near-hurricane strength before being absorbed by a cold front on September 25."

        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the African coast on September 10. Shortly thereafter, it lost most of its atmospheric convection and initially showed few signs of development as it moved westward. On September 14, convection reformed near the center of the system. It continued to organize, and the next day the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified it as Tropical Depression Twelve.[1] At the time, it was located 470\u00a0mi (765\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands.[2] By this point, the depression had a weak circulation and ragged convection. An anticyclone to its north caused the depression to move generally to the west, and upper-level conditions were forecast to be favorable for intensification.[3] However, the circulation moved away from the main area of convection[4] before a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated that the depression degenerated into a tropical wave on September 16. Although there was not a closed circulation, the flight observed flight-level winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) to the north and east of the system.[1] The remnants of the depression continued westward, moving through the Lesser Antilles on September 17. Despite favorable conditions for redevelopment including low wind shear and warm ocean temperatures, the system remained a tropical wave as it moved across the Caribbean Sea. Late on September 19, another reconnaissance plane discovered a closed circulation to the northwest of Grand Cayman. Although there was minimal convection near the center, it organized enough to be re-classified as a tropical depression.[1] Upon redeveloping, the depression was moved west-northwestward around a large anticyclone to the east of Florida. Its circulation was broad, though the NHC anticipated further strengthening.[5] Conditions remained favorable for intensification, but instead the depression weakened as it approached Cuba.[6] Around 1200\u00a0UTC on September 20, it moved across the western tip of Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico with minimal thunderstorms near the center.[1] A few hours later, the NHC noted that \"the cyclone [was] on the verge of breaking open into an east-west oriented trough\". The agency did not discontinue advisories due to an increase in convection near the center, although no intensification was expected.[7] However, the system's circulation and convection became better organized,[8] and early on September 21 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Helene.[1] Upon becoming a tropical storm, Helene gradually turned to the north while rounding an anticyclone to its east.[9] It rapidly intensified after its upgrade, and reached its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) late on September 21.[1] The storm was small with an asymmetric wind field, and wind shear displaced the circulation from the deep convection.[9] Increasing wind shear prevented Helene from attaining hurricane status, and the storm began weakening on September 22 as it approached the northern Gulf Coast.[1] By 0900\u00a0UTC that day, strong wind shear moved the convection away from the center and toward the north and northeast. This prompted NHC forecaster Lixion Avila to remark, \"If I did not have a reconnaissance plane in the area, I would not know there was a tropical cyclone by just observing IR satellite imagery.\"[10] The storm made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida at 1200\u00a0UTC on September 22 after weakening from its peak intensity to winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[1] After moving ashore, an area of convection redeveloped over Helene's center and the circulation became well-defined on radar imagery. The storm accelerated to the northeast into the Westerlies,[11] and about six hours following its landfall, Helene weakened to tropical depression status after crossing into southeastern Alabama.[1] A few hours later, the NHC issued the last advisory on the system and transferred warnings to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center. Hurricane forecast models anticipated restrengthening, and due to the forecast track north of the Gulf Stream, the NHC predicted intensification as an extratropical cyclone. The agency noted that 1997's Tropical Storm Danny re-intensified in the same region as a tropical cyclone.[12] Despite strong wind shear, convection increased over Helene's center as the storm moved through North Carolina. Stations along the Outer Banks reported sustained winds up to 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). Satellite imagery and buoy data indicated that Helene re-intensified into a tropical storm inland over North Carolina. The storm emerged from the Virginia coast into an area of less wind shear, where conditions were thus more favorable for strengthening. The storm became compact over the northern Atlantic Ocean, with a diameter of 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km). Strong convection developed over the center on September 24, and the following day Helene re-attained its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) while southeast of Nova Scotia. The wind estimate was based on observations from the Neptune Olivine, a nearby ship that recorded 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) winds and a barometric pressure of 988\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg); because the ship was located to the south of the center, the storm's minimum pressure was estimated at 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). Helene continued moving rapidly to the east-northeast, and late on September 25 dissipated as it was absorbed by a cold front.[1]"

The watch was discontinued after the depression degenerated into a tropical wave. As a tropical wave, Helene moved through the Lesser Antilles with strong winds; gusts on Guadeloupe reached 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h). The system also produced heavy rainfall, reaching 3.14\u00a0in (80\u00a0mm) on Antigua. The wave passed to the south of Puerto Rico on September 17 and 18.[1] Across the southern and eastern portion of the island, the system produced 6 to 12\u00a0in (150 to 300\u00a0mm) of rainfall, which resulted in flash flooding and mudslides. One house was destroyed and more than 100\u00a0houses were affected in Ponce, forcing several families to evacuate. The flooding also destroyed a bridge in Guayama and made many roads impassable. Damage on the island was estimated at $100,000 (2000\u00a0USD).[13] After the system redeveloped into a tropical depression, the government of Cuba issued a tropical storm warning for the provinces of Isla de la Juventud, Havana, and Pinar del R\u00edo, as well as for the city of Havana.[1]"

Six hours later, the agency also issued a hurricane watch from the border of Florida and Alabama to the mouth of the Aucilla River.[1] The day before the storm moved ashore, local American Red Cross chapters had 18\u00a0emergency shelters on standby to house storm evacuees.[14] One shelter opened in Tallahassee and one in Apalachicola.[15] About 130\u00a0people evacuated to shelters in the western portion of the Florida panhandle[16] and planes evacuated military bases in the region. Government buildings were closed in Okaloosa, and schools were closed in Okaloosa, Walton, and Santa Rosa counties.[17] Despite being a weak tropical cyclone at landfall, Tropical Storm Helene caused $16\u00a0million in damage (2000\u00a0USD).[18] In Alabama, wind gusts reached 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) at Brookley Air Force Base in Mobile; the same station recorded the highest rainfall in the state, with a total of 1.08\u00a0in (27\u00a0mm). The storm also caused minor beach erosion and coastal damage along Dauphin Island.[13] In neighboring Florida, the storm dropped heavy rainfall along the panhandle, peaking at 9.56\u00a0in (243\u00a0mm) in Apalachicola. The rains caused flooding, notably in Franklin, Wakulla, and Leon counties, all of which closed schools and public buildings.[13] Flood warnings were issued for areas affected by Tropical Storm Gordon five days prior.[19] High rainfall caused the Sopchoppy River to exceed its banks and reach a record crest of 34.9\u00a0ft (10.6\u00a0m), breaking the previous record set in 1970. Several homes and nearby roads were flooded near the river. About 100\u00a0homes were flooded in Leon County, and 70\u00a0streets were flooded in Tallahassee. Portions of U.S. Highway 98 were flooded in Port St. Joe and near Carrabelle. About 70\u00a0people had to evacuate their homes due to the flooding. Flooding was minimal in the western Florida panhandle due to drought conditions the previous summer. Sustained winds across the state peaked at 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h), though gusts reached 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) at Cape San Blas.[13] At that location, there was over $100,000 in road damage and beach loss.[16] The winds combined with the heavy rainfall caused trees to fall onto power lines, leaving about 5,000\u00a0people without electricity.[13] The storm spawned 6\u00a0tornadoes along the panhandle,[16] one of which destroyed several mobile homes in Wakulla. As the storm moved ashore, tides were less than 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above normal, but were high enough to cause minor beach erosion.[13] In Leon County, the storm destroyed two homes and six mobile homes,[20] and damaged more than 120\u00a0homes in Wakulla County.[13] When Helene moved through Georgia, it had sustained winds of around 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h), with higher gusts.[13] It dropped heavy rainfall along its path, with a statewide peak of 5.13\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) in Dunwoody.[21] The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions across the state. However, the combination of winds and rainfall downed trees and power lines; one falling tree damaged a car in Sandersville.[13] To the northwest of Georgia, rainfall spread into Tennessee, reaching 3.12\u00a0in (79\u00a0mm) in Copperhill.[21] As Helene moved through South Carolina, it spawned an F2 tornado in Martin that killed one person, injured six, and damaged 12\u00a0houses.[1][22][23] The highest rainfall in the United States associated with Helene was a total of 9.60\u00a0in (244\u00a0mm) in Bamberg,[24] though weather radar images estimated totals of up to 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm). The rains caused flooding along Highway 47, in nearby Orangeburg County where 5.3\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) were recorded.[22] In Berkeley County, a woman died after hydroplaning and driving her car into a tree.[13] Rainfall in North Carolina peaked at 8.31\u00a0in (211\u00a0mm) in Longwood;[21] in Jacksonville, the precipitation caused street flooding.[25] Off the shore of North Carolina, a station at Diamond Shoal Light reported wind gusts of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) while Helene was re-intensifying into a tropical storm. Along the coast, the highest gusts were 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h), reported at both Cape Lookout and Duck.[1] Rainfall from the storm extended through Virginia and into Delaware.[26]"

The cyclone moved southwestward for much of its duration, striking Mauritius on 10 February at peak intensity with winds of 218\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph). It later passed just southeast of R\u00e9union before turning to the south and weakening. The cyclone became extratropical on 14 February in the southern Indian Ocean. In Mauritius, Hollanda destroyed or severely damaged 450\u00a0houses, which left at least 1,500\u00a0people homeless. High winds left half of the island without power, and also caused severe crop damage; nearly half of the island's sugar crop was destroyed, which necessitated for the government to assist in replanting efforts. Hollanda killed 2\u00a0people and caused $135\u00a0million in damage on Mauritius. About a week after the cyclone struck, Cyclone Ivy also affected the area, although to a lesser degree. The highest rainfall from the cyclone fell on R\u00e9union, with 741\u00a0mm (29.2\u00a0in) recorded at Grand Coude."

        "content": "Based on analysis from M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR), a disturbance in the Indian Ocean Intertropical Convergence Zone became evident south of the Chagos Archipelago on 6 February, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar and moved away from the region.[1] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same general area.[2] Later that day, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On 8 February, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone\u00a0\u2013 the equivalent of a hurricane\u00a0\u2013 on 9 February.[1] After becoming a tropical cyclone, Hollanda developed a small 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) eye as it tracked toward the island of Mauritius, located east of Madagascar. Continuing to intensify, the cyclone struck the northern coast of the island at 1800\u00a0UTC on 10 February at peak intensity,[1] with winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained winds) as assessed by MFR.[3] In addition, the cyclone produced gusts to 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[1] At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) (1\u00a0minute sustained winds).[2] While moving over Mauritius, the eye became disrupted, although Hollanda maintained much of its intensity as it passed just southeast of R\u00e9union early on 11 February. The cyclone remained well-defined as it moved more poleward, and an irregular eye remained visible on satellite imagery. On 13 February, Hollanda turned eastward due to a trough, and the next day it became extratropical over the southern Indian Ocean. Its remnants persisted at least two more days.[1]"

        "content": "Before Hollanda struck Mauritius, most people were already residing at home, due to the cyclone striking during the Chinese New Year.[4] Officials closed the airport prior to the cyclone's arrival, and most stores and banks were also closed. Officials also ordered for cars to be off the roads during the storm and for people to remain indoors. Forecasters initially expected the storm would remain slightly offshore.[5] Ultimately, Cyclone Hollanda made landfall at peak intensity, producing wind gusts of 216\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) in Mauritius's capital city of Port Louis.[1] Strong winds affected the northern and western portions of the island, particularly near the coast, and the cyclone was considered the worst to hit there since Cyclone Gervaise in 1975.[4] In addition to the winds, the storm dropped torrential rainfall that reached 711\u00a0mm (28.0\u00a0in) in Mare aux Vacoas.[1] Across the island, Hollanda destroyed 290\u00a0houses and severely damaged another 160, which left at least 1,500\u00a0people homeless.[4] Included among the damaged buildings was the Russian embassy, which faced such difficulties making repairs that the ambassadors moved their offices.[6] Damage to schools was estimated at 25\u00a0million rupees ($1.3\u00a0million 1994\u00a0USD),[7] causing some to be closed for as long as 12\u00a0days.[8] High winds downed 30% of the island's trees.[7] Many fell onto power lines,[4] which left 60% of Mauritians without power and about half without telephone service.[7] All external communications were cut to the country during the cyclone.[9] In addition, nearly half of the sugar plantations were destroyed,[4] although the primary industry of tourism was not significantly affected.[10] In total, the cyclone killed two people,[4] and left $135\u00a0million in damage (1994\u00a0USD);[11] the total included lost productivity, such as decreased sugar output.[7] Less than a week after Hollanda struck, Cyclone Ivy also hit Mauritius, although to a lesser extent than Hollanda. The combined impact caused most roads to be blocked by either fallen trees or mudslides; all main roads were quickly restored.[4] Following the storm's passage, the Mauritius government opened 130\u00a0shelters, and also provided 5,000\u00a0rupees to each homeless family.[4] The crop damage from Hollanda, in addition to a drought, decreased the following year's output by 22%.[12] In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant their crops.[4] Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm.[4] The country's prime minister issued an appeal to the European Union for 67\u00a0million rupees ($3.6\u00a0million 1994\u00a0USD) in assistance, although later dropped it to less than half that total.[13] The requested aid was for the restoration of phone and power utilities.[14] The storm's severe impact on Mauritius caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita,[15] and the overall GDP decreased by 10%.[16] Although the cyclone did not strike the island of R\u00e9union, Hollanda produced strong wind gusts that peaked at 234\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) in Sainte-Rose. Rainfall on the island peaked at 741\u00a0mm (29.2\u00a0in) at Grand Coude. The cyclone left damage to crops, power systems, telephones, and the water network, mostly due to the strong winds.[1]"

The fifth named storm and fourth hurricane of the annual season, Erick originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on June\u00a018. The wave tracked swiftly westward with little development, emerging into the eastern Pacific on July\u00a01. As a result of favorable environmental conditions, the wave developed into a tropical depression on July\u00a04, and further into Tropical Storm Erick at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05. Steered generally west-northwest, Erick intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane and reached its peak intensity with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) on July\u00a06. Its proximity to land and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to deteriorate into a tropical storm the following day, though it remained at such intensity until degenerating into a remnant low early on July\u00a09. The remnant circulation dissipated a few hours later, southwest of Baja California Sur. In preparation for the cyclone, numerous tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for various portions of the coastline of Mexico. Ports were closed and residents in low-lying areas were asked to evacuate to higher grounds. In addition, shipping by means of boat was suspended. Though the center of Erick remained offshore, the outer bands of the system brought gusty winds and isolated heavy rainfall to Western Mexico. In Guerrero, minor flooding was reported in the cities of Acapulco and Puerto Marques. A river overflowed its banks in Nayarit, flooding several cities in the state. Numerous cars, streets, and homes were damaged by flooding. A woman died as she attempted to flee her house, while a man was killed after being swept away by the river. Hundreds of people were rescued by the Mexican military and Nayarit officials. Across Baja California Sur, the storm produced widespread precipitation, leading to flooding."

        "content": "On June\u00a018, a tropical wave emerged off the western coastline of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic. Tracking steadily westward, it maintained a small but organized area of convection\u2014shower and thunderstorm activity\u2014along its axis for the next several days. The wave crossed the Lesser Antilles on June\u00a024 and Central America on June\u00a029, emerging into the eastern Pacific shortly thereafter.[1] During the evening of July\u00a01, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system, noting that environmental conditions were expected to become favorable for slow development.[2] The wave interacted with a larger area of low pressure on July\u00a02, leading to an increase in convective coverage and the formation of a broad low-pressure area. Continuing slowly westward, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression at 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04, while centered 205\u00a0mi (330\u00a0km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico.[1] Despite the initially exposed center of circulation, a byproduct of moderate wind shear, the depression soon began to organize as convective banding increased and gained more curvature.[3] This led to the classification of Tropical Storm Erick at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05.[1] Under the influence of a mid-level ridge over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and an upper-level ridge over the southwestern United States, the newly upgraded Erick tracked west-northwest parallel to the coastline of Mexico.[4] A central dense overcast formed by the daylight hours of July\u00a05, with tight banding noted on satellite. In addition, microwave imagery indicated the formative stages of an eyewall.[5] Initially vertically decoupled, the storm became more vertically aligned throughout the following hours. A ragged eye became intermittently visible on satellite, and Erick was upgraded to Category\u00a01 hurricane status at 0600\u00a0UTC, located approximately 105\u00a0mi (170\u00a0km) west-southwest of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Mexico.[1][6] In conjunction with satellite intensity estimates, it is estimated that Erick attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983\u00a0mb (hPa; 29.03\u00a0inHg) at 1200\u00a0UTC. Shortly thereafter, its proximity to the coastline of Mexico and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to begin a weakening trend.[7] At 1800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a07, Erick weakened to a tropical storm as its associated convective mass warmed and the eye deteriorated.[8] Wind shear caused the center of circulation to become exposed on July\u00a09 as the system passed just south of Baja California Sur,[9] leading to degeneration into a remnant low-pressure area at 0600\u00a0UTC. The remnant vortex persisted for a few more hours, before dissipating over cold sea surface temperatures at 0000 UTC on July 10.[1]"

By 0300\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05, the watch was extended from Acapulco to Manzanillo, while a tropical storm warning was issued from L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas to Manzanillo. Several hours later, the watch was discontinued for the coastline stretching from Acapulco to L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and issued from La Fortuna to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Meanwhile, the warning from L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas to Manzanillo was discontinued, with a new warning issued from Zihuatanejo to La Fortuna. All tropical storm watches in effect were discontinued by 0300\u00a0UTC the following morning, with the warning being extended from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. After being upgraded to a hurricane, Erick prompted the issuance of hurricane watches stretching from Punta San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes. At 1500\u00a0UTC on July\u00a06, a tropical storm watch was issued from Santa Fe to La Paz, though this was upgraded to a warning several hours later. Following many other revisions, all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued after Erick degenerated into a remnant low early on July\u00a09.[1] In preparation for the tropical cyclone, an \"orange\" alert was issued for southern Michoac\u00e1n, southern Jalisco, and the entire state of Colima, while a \"yellow\" alert was posted for the rest of the Jalisco coastline.[10] The ports of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo, and Manzanillio were closed.[11] In fear of flash flooding, residents along low-lying areas of Acapulco were urged to evacuate.[12] Meanwhile, the government of Michoac\u00e1n ordered the suspension of shipping by boat.[13] Despite remaining offshore, the outer rainbands of the storm affected the southwestern coastline with gusty winds and heavy rainfall,[11] with similar effects farther northwest.[14] In Acapulco and Puerto Marques, the storm was responsible for minor flooding.[15] Elsewhere across the state, damage was minor and mostly due to landslides.[16] Along the coast of Colima, waves up to 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) were recorded.[17] Although some flooding was reported across the state, damage was considered minor.[18] Further north, Erick brought extensive flood damage to Nayarit.[19] A 74-year-old woman died while trying to escape her flooded house, while dozens of vehicles were damaged and several other streets and homes were flooded. One river overflowed its banks, affecting numerous cities. Officials in Nayarit attempted to rescue hundreds of people affected by Hurricane Erick,[19] many of whom waited on streets to be rescued.[20] Dozens of families were directly affected by the storm. Substantial amounts of debris piled up on streets. Residents reported severe economical losses, especially in Xalisco, where a disaster declaration was necessary. Offshore, a waterspout was reported.[18] In Tepic, Governor Roberto Sandoval ordered a state of emergency.[20] Damages from the storm in Nayarit totaled to MXN$386.4 million (USD$21.8 million).[21] Although the core of the system remained offshore, a \"yellow\" alert was issued for Baja California Sur. Heavy rain was recorded over much of the peninsula, resulting in flooding. The ports of La Paz, Cabo San Lucas, and San Jose del Cabo were closed due to high waves.[22] Additionally, a \"green\" alert was issued for Baja California.[23] In all, two people were killed while two others were missing.[24]"

Phanfone, which is a Laotian word for Animal. The twenty-ninth and final named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, the origins of Phanfone can be traced to an upper-level low which had formed near the Caroline Islands and gradually organized into a tropical depression on December 19. Moving generally west-northwestward, the system intensified into a tropical storm on December 22 and moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on the following day as it continued gaining strength. Phanfone intensified to typhoon status shortly before making its first landfall over the Eastern Visayas region on Christmas Eve. Further intensification ensued until Christmas Day despite Phanfone making several landfalls over the central Philippine islands, peaking at 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained winds with a central pressure dropping to 970\u00a0hPa (29\u00a0inHg). Phanfone maintained its typhoon strength for several hours as it exited the Philippines landmass before unfavorable conditions caused it to rapidly deteriorate and dissipate over the South China Sea. Phanfone crossed the central Philippines after the stronger Kammuri struck nearly the same region merely weeks prior, with a track fairly similar to 2013\u2019s Haiyan.[1] The system caused destruction in the regions of Eastern Visayas, Western Visayas, and Mimaropa. The total fatalities of the said typhoon is 50 deaths (with 55 people missing, and over 300 injured) and the damages is at $67.2\u00a0million (2019 US dollars) or roughly \u20b13.44\u00a0billion.[2][3]"

Showing signs of convection and sufficient banding around a defined center, the JTWC subsequently upgraded its initial warning to a medium chance of development. Shortly thereafter on December 20, JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, while the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its first advisory on the system. By December 22, the system gained tropical storm strength[4] and JMA issued the named Phanfone.\nMoving generally west-northwestward, Phanfone moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at 5:00 am PHT December 23 and the Philippine weather bureau PAGASA locally named the system as Ursula.[5][6] Owing to favorable conditions, Phanfone intensified further into a severe tropical storm hours later. By afternoon of December 24, Phanfone gained typhoon strength[4] shortly before making its first three landfalls over Salcedo, Eastern Samar (4:45 pm PHT),[7] Tacloban City (7:30 pm PHT),[8] and Cabucgayan, Biliran (9:15 pm PHT).[8] Further intensification ensued until December 25, with Phanfone peaking at 00:00 UTC with 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained winds and a central pressure dropping to 970 hPa;[9][4] the JTWC reported that Phanfone peaked at 175\u00a0km (109\u00a0mi)nute sustained winds, equivalent to a Category 2 typhoon.[10] Phanfone continued its west-northwestward track and, by afternoon of the same day, PAGASA had reported four additional landfalls: Gigantes Islands (2:30 am PHT), Ibajay, Aklan (8:40 am PHT), Semirara Island (1:00 pm PHT), and Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro (3:00 pm PHT).[11] By December 26, Phanfone had already exited the Philippine landmass, moving northwest over the South China Sea. After holding strength for several hours, the system began losing strength due to unfavorable sea surface temperatures, medium wind shear and dry air intrusion. On December 27, Phanfone dropped to tropical storm status while rapidly deteriorating and slowly moving.[12][13] On December 28, PAGASA issued its final warning as the system exited the PAR;[14] later, JMA issued their final advisories as Phanfone weakened below warning threshold."

It was issued to the central portion of northern Cebu, northeastern Iloilo, northern Antique, Capiz, Aklan, Southern Leyte, and Negros Occidental, which meant that Phanfone was taking a similar path to the areas hit by the much stronger Typhoon Haiyan. The Visayas was the worst hit, with Iloilo City having 13 casualties alone that had been either struck by fallen trees, electrocuted or drowned. Roxas, Tacloban and Maasin all received 140\u00a0mm (5.5\u00a0in) of rain. The extent of damage in the Philippines was quite far, with the Boracay Airport being heavily damaged as many people were stranded in the airport as the typhoon struck. A disaster response officer also reported that power outages and damage in the town of Batad in Iloilo Province made it appear as a \u201cghost town\u201d. Severe flooding caused devastating damage in the many provinces and islands of Visayas as rain spread across the region, with many houses and vehicles being partially to completely submerged.[15] Multiple houses were crumpled and trees were downed, as well as power lines being downed. All of these obstacles blocked off roads and made roads dangerous to walk on; and the excessive amounts of rainfall made ground, especially higher ground, very unstable. The province of Leyte was placed under a state of calamity following the damage of the typhoon, with livestock, crops and infrastructure being damaged in excess of $1 million USD.[16] Most of the casualties are estimated to have taken place at Iloilo, as the village was badly hit with severe and swift-moving flash floods. Tacloban was hit as fires broke out and winds allowed them to spread but it the 220,000 inhabitants escaped the worst of the system.[17] 147 cities were affected by power outages but by Friday, December 27, 31 of those 147 had their power restored."

A signal 1 warning was issued to Bulacan, Bataan, Metro Manila, Rizal, rest of Quezon, Laguna, Batangas, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Catanduanes and northern Palawan. The island's governor ordered local government units to conduct a forced evacuation plan, prompting civilians near flood-prone areas and areas with the potential to be affected by landslides, to relocate temporarily as a safety precaution. Local representatives visited residents in Libon, Maninila and Tandarora to advise them to evacuate and temporarily celebrate Christmas in evacuation centers for their safety. Many public schools were open in order to serve as shelters for residents while the provincial government distributed food packs to the evacuees. In Naval, the local government unit deployed evacuation tents for evacuees on Monday, December 23 with some tents reserved for senior citizens, pregnant women and people with disabilities. Personnel of the Romblon Provincial Mobile Force Company were deployed and conducted an inventory of Search and Rescue (SAR) equipment on December 23 in preparation for the typhoon.[22] San Jose experienced 217\u00a0mm (8.5\u00a0in) of rain in just under 24 hours. Upwards of 58,000 people were evacuated from Luzon and its surrounding islands as the system brought torrential rain and severe flash flooding ensued as a result of the rains.

Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered the greatest damage, as the rain was the heaviest in 120 years of recorded weather measurements.[10][11] By 20 May, at least 62 people had died as a result of the flooding, and hundreds of thousands had been forced from their homes. Towns of Obrenovac in Serbia and Doboj in Bosnia and Herzegovina account for most victims, after being inundated by several-meter high waters from nearby rivers.[12] Floodwaters caused over 2,000 landslides across Southeast Europe, spreading damage across many towns and villages.[13] The rains activated torrents and mudslides, and subsequently several rivers in watersheds of Sava and Morava rose and flooded surrounding valleys. Official counts indicate that over 1.6 million people were affected in Serbia and Bosnia, after a week of flooding.[14] Assessments of the damage range up to \u20ac3.5 billion for Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina.[15] Damage in Serbia, jointly estimated by EU, World Bank group and UN officials, stands at 1,55 billion euros.[16] Officials in Bosnia stated that the damage could exceed that of the Bosnian War.[17] The events initiated a large international aid campaign, with numerous countries, organizations and individuals donating humanitarian, material and monetary support for the affected areas."

The cold polar air mass met with humid subtropical air, leading to very low pressure. On 14 May, the low moved over Southeast Europe, becoming stationary. As a result, extremely heavy rain fell within the region; Serbia (in the area around Belgrade) and Bosnia were most affected.[18] Serbian and Bosnian meteorologists named the formed cyclone \"Tamara\".[19][20] On 15 May, the daily amounts of rainfall broke historical records in Belgrade (107.9\u00a0mm), Valjevo (108.2\u00a0mm) and Loznica (110\u00a0mm).[21] By 15 May, the monthly rainfall in Belgrade had broken the historical record (175\u00a0L from 1897), reaching 205\u00a0L.[22] By Saturday, May 17, the rain had subsided, and the weather gradually became warmer and sunnier, somewhat easing relief and rescue efforts. On 18 May, the cyclone moved further northwest.[20] The main flooding region was the watershed of the Sava river, which forms a border between Bosnia and Croatia, flows into Serbia, and drains into the Danube in Belgrade. On Wednesday, 14 May, heavy rainfall caused torrential floods across mountainous regions, which destroyed bridges and infrastructure, and caused numerous landslides. The deadliest impact occurred on Thursday, 15 May, when water levels in several right-bank tributaries of the Sava suddenly and uncontrollably rose at an unprecedented rate, flooding towns in their valleys. The Bosna river in central Bosnia completely flooded the cities of Doboj, Maglaj, Zavidovi\u0107i and \u0160amac, while the Kolubara, near Belgrade, did the same to Obrenovac; those cities had the major share of victims. Subsequently, the Sava itself rose to record-high levels, threatening the cities of Slavonski Brod, \u0160abac and Sremska Mitrovica and numerous villages, but the damage was relatively contained as the population, helped by army and volunteers, strengthened flood defenses. Nonetheless, embankments gave way in several places. Heavy rainfall was also experienced in the region on 3 and 4 May, affecting Romania, Italy and Bosnia. The event produced limited damage but left a number of flooding incidents and high rivers.[23] A state of emergency was declared in parts of Bosnia by local government."

        "content": "Though heaviest affected areas were in the valleys of the Sava and Kolubara rivers, the center of the flood was the drainage basin of the Bosna river and its mouth into the Sava. Water in the Sava then broke through the newly constructed embankment on the left bank in Croatia and flooded the Lower Syrmia region. The water then uncontrollably rushed into the Bosut river which flows back into the Sava in Serbia. In Serbia, the heaviest floods were in the Kolubara river basin where the major rainfall caused extreme torrents in the mountains, causing the hydrological coincidence, a fact that high tidal waves appeared simultaneously on both the left and the right tributaries of the Kolubara. Rivers of Pe\u0161tan and Vrani\u010dina also spilled over, flooding the surface mine \"Tamnava-Zapadna Polje\", within the Kolubara mines (see Lake Paljuvi). The flooded mines captured 200 million m3 of the flood water.[24] Belgrade's Institute \"Jaroslav \u010cerni\", funded by UNDP, compiled a study \"Improvement of the water protection in the Kolubara drainage basin\". Hydrological section of the report concludes that the cyclone caused the \"continual rain of temperate intensity\", which however lasted for too long (over three days). In May, the measured 48-hours rainfall was higher than the millennial rains in Loznica while the return period in Belgrade and Valjevo was 400 years. Return periods of the flow in the Kolubara was 120\u2013520 and at the confluence into the Sava, when the Kolubara flooded Obrenovac and the mines, the discharge was 1,456\u00a0m3/s (51,400\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). If the system against the floods was finished and functioning properly, and that mines and Obrenovac weren't flooded, the discharge would be 2,460\u00a0m3/s (87,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).[24] In the drainage basin of the Bosna river in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the rains in some places were exceeding the return period of 5,000 years (Vidmar A., et al., \"The Bosna River floods in May 2014\", Journal on Flood Risk, p.\u00a01\u201325). At the same time, during the massive overspill in the basin, the return period of the maximal discharge (4,121\u00a0m3/s (145,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), 15 May 2014) was only 152 years and of the wave volume (1,463,000,000\u00a0m3 (5.17\u00d71010\u00a0cu\u00a0ft)) was 189 years. After the reconstruction of the flood in the controlled environment, it was concluded that the discharge of the Bosna at Doboj would be 5,000\u00a0m3/s (180,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) on 16 May 2014. A discharge of the Sava, right after the mouth of the Bosna, at the \u0160amac bridge, was 6,000\u00a0m3/s (210,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) on 17 May (Abdulaj R., et al., Velike vode donjeg toka rijeke Save tijekom svibnja 2014, Hrvatska vodoprivreda, 207, 14\u201316, 2014). Downstream, in Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia, the discharge of the Sava was 6,420\u00a0m3/s (227,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) (Hidrolo\u0161ki godi\u0161njak RHMZ Srbije za 2014).[24] If the entire flood control system in all three countries functioned, and that there were no overspills and floods, a hydrological coincidence of joining the highest Sava and Kolubara water levels would occur. That means that in Belgrade, downstream from the mouth of Kolubara into the Sava, the Sava would bring almost 9,000\u00a0m3/s (320,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). The riparian zone along the Sava in Belgrade, called Savski Nasip and enhanced with the embankments, is designed for receiving 6,500\u00a0m3/s (230,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), so the city would probably suffer a major damage. Additionally, due to the illegal construction of the houses in the Savski Nasip area, the riparian zone is being destroyed and its volume is reduced.[24]"

The entire city was evacuated.[27][28] During 18 May, the water level dropped, which enabled the evacuation of the citizens of Obrenovac to be carried out by trucks instead of boats.[29] As of 20 May the total number of evacuated persons exceeded 30,000.[30] In Krupanj in western Serbia (located in a valley of several small rivers) torrents, mudslides and landslides devastated the infrastructure and destroyed dozens of houses. Because of road damages, the town was completely inaccessible for three days, and the road to Loznica was blocked until 18 May. Electric power was cut for almost the whole municipality.[31] Around 500 houses were seriously damaged and at least 20 houses are completely uninhabitable[32] Part of the village of Rebelj in Valjevo municipality was annihilated by landslides.[33] In the Drina river valley, on the border with Bosnia, heavy rain activated landslides, cutting off several villages and closing roads. At Mali Zvornik, a giant hill threatened to slide into the river and cut its flow, endangering that town and Zvornik across the river.[27][34] Peak flood waters from Sava river hit \u0160abac on 18 May, but the embankments survived, strengthened by efforts of the army and several thousands volunteers. Flood waters on the river reached 6.3 metres (21\u00a0ft), the highest on record, endangering \u0160abac and Sremska Mitrovica on the left bank.[26] In anticipation of the floods, a 7.3-metre-tall (24\u00a0ft) temporary embankment was erected.[26] Further east, along the valleys of Morava and Mlava rivers, city centers of Para\u0107in, Petrovac na Mlavi, Svilajnac and Smederevska Palanka were flooded.[28][35] During the flooding period, an estimated 300,000 households were left without electric power.[36] Serbia's energy minister, Aleksandar Anti\u0107, has appealed to individuals to conserve power as best they can.[13] The largest thermoelectric power plant in Serbia, TPP Nikola Tesla, which supplies close to 50% of electricity in Serbia, lies in the vicinity of Obrenovac, but was saved from danger. However, flood waters filled the largest coal field of RB Kolubara with 210 million cubic meters of water, more than the volume of Vlasina lake, and its pumping out is expected to take months.[37] Further east, the thermoelectric power plant TPP Kostolac, which supplies 11% of electricity in Serbia, was threatened by floods from the Mlava river, but the water had not breached the innermost ring of defenses. During the floods, the hydro plants at Iron Gates reduced their production and opened the gates in order to lower the level of the Danube.[37] During the floods, transport across the country, particularly central and western parts, was interrupted or broken.[citation needed] 2,260 public, industrial and infrastructure facilities were flooded, and 3,500 roads were destroyed.[27] The Belgrade\u2013Bar railway was severed at several locations in western Serbia, and has been closed; basic reparations took about a month to complete, and afterwards the trains were forced to take a several-hours detour. Reconstruction of the section in the Gradac river canyon was finished in March 2015, allowing the trains to return to the original route.[38] Agricultural damage in affected areas was total, and the amount is yet to be determined. Thousands of cows, sheep, chicken and other domestic animals perished in the floods, and their corpses present a serious health risk for people who started returning and repairing their homes. On 20 May, the Government of Serbia proclaimed 3 days of mourning.[27][39] Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 described the flooding as \"the worst natural catastrophe that has ever hit Serbia.\"[citation needed] In a July 2014 report by the Government of Serbia, the total amount of damage in the country was estimated at 1.53 billion Euro. Of those, 810 million was attributed to direct damage, and 662 million to losses. Two thirds of the damage was attributed to the production sector (500 million direct and 569 million indirect), of which 228 million in the agricultural sector. Total damage on the housing was 227.3 million, while the infrastructure damage (transportation, communications and water management) was assessed at 192 million.[40]"

Northern and northeastern Bosnia, including the region of Semberija, was also flooded. Rivers that flooded included the Bosna, Vrbas, Drina, Sana and Sava. A state of emergency was declared across the nation.[26] Herzegovina in the south and central regions were not hit by floods. The town of Maglaj experienced the average rainfall of two months in under 48 hours.[26] In the city of Zavidovi\u0107i, a footbridge was filmed being swept down the Bosna river and crashing into another bridge.[42] In Sarajevo, the Miljacka river swelled almost to the level of city bridges.[41] The entire hamlet of Pari\u0107i in Hrasno Donje, municipality of Kalesija, was swept away by landslides.[43] As of 20 May, there were 24 confirmed deaths in Bosnia and Herzegovina: 17 in Republika Srpska and 7 in the Federation.[44] At a press conference on 19 May, the Director of Police of Republika Srpska gave the names of 17 confirmed victims: 10 in Doboj, 2 in \u0160amac, 2 in Modri\u010da and one each in Bijeljina, Vlasenica and Donji \u017dabar; an additional 7 persons are still listed as missing.[45] Governments of the two entities jointly declared 20 May a day of mourning across the country.[44] It was speculated that the floodwaters might have disturbed land mines left over from the Bosnian War (1992\u201395) which could cause further danger if moved outside the marked areas.[13] The chief executive of \u017deljeznice Republike Srpske, the railway operator in Republika Srpska (one of two railway operators in Bosnia) appealed for help in repairing the enormous damage to the railways in the country, stating that they were independently unable to repair the damage, appealing for help from the international community in supplying materials, mechanisation and financial assistance.[46]"

The embankment on the Sava River was breached near Rajevo Selo and Ra\u010dinovci, and thus evacuation was ordered for Gunja, Rajevo Selo and Ra\u010dinovci. As of 19 May, around 15,000 people in easternmost parts of Croatia were evacuated from their homes.[48] One of the most critical points was the embankment of the Sava river in Slavonski \u0160amac, where the confluence of the Bosna and Sava is located. At that point the embankments were under severe pressure caused by the huge amount of water coming from Bosnia. Several officials stated that if this embankment were breached, the entire region of southern Slavonia, with a population of over 300 000, would be flooded.[49] There were also floods in Banovina region, in the towns of Hrvatska Kostajnica and Dvor, mostly caused by the river Una, whose level had not been as high since 1955.[50]\nVideo: http://vimeo.com/96164094"

He has stated that the Tamnava pit is now an artificial lake. The Kolubara coal fields are open pits from which coal is supplied to the TPP Nikola Tesla. There are enough stockpiles of coal at hand to bridge the period until the coal pits are fully operational, but the delivery system needs repairs.[146] The European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Kristalina Georgieva stated that Croatia and Serbia have the possibility to apply for aid from the European Union Solidarity Fund, up to one billion euro in one year,[147] but this was later rescinded as a misstatement of the Commissioner. The EU Solidarity Fund in 2014 is 500 million euros, while individual countries can expect around 10 million.[148] The aid can be transferred if the damage is assessed to be over 0.64% of the country's GDP. For Serbia, that would be around 175 million euros in damages. Bosnia, not being a candidate or member country of the EU, is not eligible for aid from this fund. Serbia applied for the World Bank aid credit, amounting to a total of \u20ac227 million.[149]"

An upper level anticyclone just to the northwest was enhancing pole ward outflow.[3] During that day the disturbance developed further with improved convective banding in the northern quadrant, however interaction with land was a major hindrance.[4] Early on May 1, the disturbance was designated as a Tropical Depression by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and the Japan Meteorological Agency, with PAGASA assigning the name Dante to the depression.[5][6] Later that day PAGASA declared that Dante had made landfall on the Bicol Region in Southeastern Luzon.[7] Early the next day the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance as whilst the low level circulation center had remained slow moving over southeastern Luzon the disturbance had a good outflow with convection starting to improve in terms of organization.[8] Later that morning the JTWC designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression 01W.[9] The Depression was being moved by the reverse oriented monsoon trough with a well formed low level circulation center with deep convective banding wrapping around the northern quadrant despite being close to land.[9][10] Later on May 2, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Dante to a Tropical Storm, with the JMA assigning the name of Kujira to the cyclone.[6][10] During the next day Kujira quickly intensified due to favorable sea surface temperatures with the JMA upgrading it to a Severe Tropical Storm later that day, before becoming a Typhoon early on May 4 by both the JMA and the JTWC as animated infrared imagery was showing the development of an eye feature.[6][11][12][13][14] Later that day both the JMA and the JTWC declared that Kujira had reached its peak wind speeds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) (10-min) 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) (1-min) after Kujira had formed a small round eye.[6][15] PAGASA then released their final advisory as Typhoon Kujira had moved out of the eastern edge of their area of responsibility as the typhoon had started to weaken due to convective banding around the low level circulation center beginning to unravel.[16][17] After moving out of PAGASA's area of responsibility Kujira continued to weaken as it developed a cloud filled eye with the cyclone starting its extra tropical transition during May 6.[18][19] Early the next day the JTWC downgraded Kujira to a Tropical Storm, while the JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm, as it had rapidly lost its vertical organization and was beginning to take on frontal characteristics, a sign that the cyclone was becoming extratropical.[6][20] As a result of this, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Kujira; however, the JMA kept issuing advisories on a weakening Kujira, until the agency downgraded it to an extratropical low later that day.[6][20] The extratropical low that was Kujira was then tracked by the JMA, until early on May 13, when the JMA reported that Kujira had dissipated.[6]"

In a marginally favorable environment, it attained minimal tropical storm status later that day. The storm remained offshore, and peaked as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras. It accelerated northeast parallel to the East Coast and became extratropical on July 23 near Nova Scotia. Because it was a weak storm and never made landfall, Cristobal's effects were mostly limited to moderate rainfall. The storm dropped 3.43 in (87\u00a0mm) of rain in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding was reported.

Late on July 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that a tropical depression was developing,[7] with its convection becoming more concentrated around a circulation; at 11 p.m. EST on July 18 (0300\u00a0UTC July 19), it was classified as Tropical Depression Three, about 65\u00a0miles (105\u00a0km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.[8] Located between a ridge to its southeast and northwest, the depression moved slowly northeastward, and with a marginally favorable upper-level environment, it attained minimal tropical storm status during the early afternoon of July 19.[9] Initially fairly disorganized with little deep convection,[10] dry air in the mid- to-upper-levels of the atmosphere prevented immediate intensification.[11] However, late on July 20 thunderstorm activity increased.[12] Cristobal remained a fairly weak tropical storm as it tracked adjacent to the Carolina coast, and the storm never made landfall. It reached peak intensity as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras, and remained such over the warm Gulf Stream waters as convection became strong over the southern portion of the circulation.[13] Beginning to enter cooler waters, the cyclone accelerated east-northeastward on July 21 and July 22.[14] On the afternoon of July 22, Cristobal began to weaken south of Nova Scotia. In the evening hours, satellite imagery indicated that the mid-level center became separated from the low-level center.[15] The storm's cloud pattern became disorganized, and by July 23 it had completed an extratropical transition.

The sudden, heavy rainfall clogged storm drains, causing some street flooding.[21] Up to 40 cars were pulled from flooded streets, some being submerged with 2\u00a0ft (0.6\u00a0m) of water. Damages from the flooding was estimated at $10,000.[22] In Georgia, the storm produced 3.48 inches (88\u00a0mm) of rain, while in South Carolina, 2.60 inches (66\u00a0mm) was recorded.[23] On July 20, Cristobal skirted eastern North Carolina, resulting in minimal damage. Along the coast, water levels rose 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) above normal;[24] rough surf was also reported.[25] Rainfall averaged 0.5 to 1.5 inches (13 to 38\u00a0mm), though the NEXRAD weather radar estimates indicated that isolated amounts exceeded 4 inches (100\u00a0mm).[24] The storm dropped 3.43\u00a0in (87\u00a0mm) in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding occurred. Because the bulk of the storm remained over open waters, winds along the coast ran about 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h).[26] While the center of Cristobal was more than a day away from the Canadian Maritimes, moisture extended ahead of the cyclone and became enhanced by a stalled frontal system.

The system was within favorable conditions for development, with low vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures reaching 28\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F).[3] The system's tropical cyclone development potential within 24 hours was further upgraded to medium by the JTWC as its broad low-level circulation began to consolidate; however, atmospheric convection was disorganized.[4] On November 9, at 01:30 UTC, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system and upgraded the system's tropical cyclone development potential within 24 hours to high.[5] By the next day, however, the low-level circulation became almost fully exposed as wind shear of 15\u201325 knots (28\u201346\u00a0km/h; 17\u201329\u00a0mph) displaced the system's convection towards the east, prompting the JTWC to cancel the TCFA and downgrade the system's tropical cyclone development potential within 24 hours to medium.[6] On November 11, the JTWC further lowered the system's tropical cyclone development potential within 24 hours to low as the system's low-level circulation became fully exposed and ill-defined.[7] On November 13, at 00:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed that the system had developed into a tropical depression near the Marshall Islands.[nb 1] Continuing westwards,[9] wind shear decreased, with the JTWC upgrading the system's tropical cyclone development potential within 24 hours to medium on November 14.[10] The PAGASA began monitoring the system,[11] and on November 17, at 12:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, assigning it the designation 33W.[12] Despite dry air surrounding the system, convective activity continued alongside anticyclonic outflow.[13] On November 18, at 03:00 UTC, 33W entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was assigned the local name Samuel by the PAGASA.[11] Turning northwest, the system's low-level circulation was broad,[14] ill-defined, and elongated,[15] with wind shear at 25\u201330 knots (46\u201356\u00a0km/h; 29\u201335\u00a0mph) displacing convection over 100 nautical miles (190\u00a0km; 120\u00a0mi) to the west of the low-level circulation.[16] 33W made landfall on Hernani, Eastern Samar on November 20, at 17:00 UTC,[11] with the JTWC downgrading it to a disturbance an hour later[12] as the system's convection fragmented.[17] After turning west-southwestward, 33W made 4 more landfalls over Cebu, Negros Occidental, and Iloilo between 22:00 UTC and 02:00 UTC on the next day. Now in the Sulu Sea,[11] the system's low-level circulation moved closer to convection,[18] and on November 21, at 12:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded 33W back to a tropical depression.[12] 33W made landfall on Araceli, Palawan at 13:00 UTC and moved into the South China Sea afterwards.[11] On November 22, at 00:00 UTC, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded 33W to a tropical storm as deep convection covered the system's low-level circulation, with the former assigning it the name Usagi.[9][12][19] Now in a favorable environment with low wind shear, the system's low-level circulation slowly consolidated and became better defined despite still being partially exposed.[20] Usagi exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility at 10:00 UTC;[11] it continued consolidating as rainbands wrapped into the system's center.[21] On November 23, an eye appeared on SSMIS microwave imagery,[22] and at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Usagi to a severe tropical storm.[9] The JTWC upgraded Usagi to a typhoon later that day.[12] On November 24, at 00:00 UTC, both the JMA and the JTWC estimated Usagi to have peaked, with the JMA estimating maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 110 kilometres per hour (70\u00a0mph) alongside a minimum central pressure of 990\u00a0hPa (29.23\u00a0inHg) and the JTWC estimating maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 165 kilometres per hour (105\u00a0mph).[9][12] An eye briefly appeared on satellite imagery before becoming filled with clouds.[23] Later in the day, a combination of land interaction and unfavorable environmental conditions caused Usagi to weaken[11] as its convective structure deteriorated.[24] Rainbands collapsed[25] as the system turned northwest,[11] and by November 25, both the JMA and the JTWC had downgraded Usagi to a tropical storm[9][12] as central convection weakened.[26] Usagi made landfall on V\u0169ng T\u00e0u at 07:00 UTC,[11] with the JTWC downgrading Usagi to a tropical depression later that day.[12] During November 26, the JMA also downgraded Usagi to a tropical depression[9] as the JTWC further downgraded Usagi to a disturbance.[12] Usagi dissipated over Cambodia at 00:00 UTC on November 27.[9]"

It destroyed 14 structures and cost an estimated $45.7 million to put out. The blaze was started due to the \"careless use of fire\" near the Roads End Resort in Kern Canyon, and spread east through the canyon and threatened the communities of Johnsondale and Ponderosa.

This left much of the soil dry and stripped, making parts of the Sequoia National Forest vulnerable to soil erosion and flooding. In November 2002, a strong rainstorm hit the fire-affected area, dumping 20 inches of rain over the course of 48 hours. This heavy rain, in conjunction with the stripped soil, caused the Kern River to swell rapidly and flood the surrounding areas of the forest. Following this flooding, an additional $3 million in emergency funds were used, in an attempt to minimize future damage from erosion and flooding.[2] Recovery efforts from the fire began in 2005 and involved the planting of 400,000 saplings over 5,000 acres of the forest, with the rest being left to recover and regrow naturally. The replanted areas continue to be monitored for growth, with further replanting occurring in areas with low survival rates. However, the entire regrowth process from the McNally Fire is expected take 150-250 years.[3]"

        "content": " Hurricane Carrie was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 1957 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm and second hurricane of the year, Carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off the western coast of Africa on September\u00a02, a type of tropical cyclogenesis typical of Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Moving to the west, the storm gradually intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September\u00a05. Carrie intensified further, before reaching peak intensity on September\u00a08 as a Category 4\u00a0hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) in the open Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane curved northwards and fluctuated in intensity as it neared Bermuda on September\u00a014. However, Carrie passed well north of the island and turned to the northeast towards Europe. Weakening as it reached higher latitudes, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a023, prior to affecting areas of the British Isles, and subsequently dissipated on September\u00a028. Due to its distance away from any major land masses, Carrie caused minimal damage along its path. On September\u00a016, the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda, causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time, though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained by one of the aircraft. As it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores, the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September\u00a021, resulting in the deaths of 80\u00a0crew members on board. As an extratropical storm, Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles, claiming three lives. The hurricane's long duration and path in open water helped it attain several Atlantic hurricane records."

        "content": "In early September, a trough was identified along the western coast of Africa. Moving towards the west as a result of a strong Azores High, the disturbance passed over Cape Verde on September\u00a02. Observations from weather stations evidenced cyclonic rotation in the region. An airplane belonging to Panair do Brasil passed within the vicinity of the vorticity and as a result reported the formation of a tropical storm.[1] In HURDAT\u2014the official database listing all known Atlantic tropical cyclones since 1851\u2014the system was listed to have reached tropical depression intensity at 0600\u00a0UTC that day.[2] The depression continued to steadily intensify as it moved westwards, later reaching the equivalent of a modern-day Category\u00a01 hurricane by 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05.[2] On September\u00a06, the ship African Star encountered the hurricane 700\u00a0mi (1,100\u00a0km) west of Cape Verde. Reported winds of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1001\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.56\u00a0inHg) confirmed the existence of the tropical cyclone.[1] A Weather Bureau forecaster remarked that the hurricane was in a \"blind spot\" at the time due to its location outside of shipping lanes and Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance missions.[3] Throughout the day, the hurricane intensified, reaching major hurricane intensity by 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07.[2] Shortly after, a United States Air Force reconnaissance flight headed for Bermuda was diverted to observe the hurricane. The flight reported a well-defined eye measuring 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) across and a minimum pressure of 945\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.91\u00a0inHg), the lowest measured in relation to the hurricane.[1] At the time, Carrie had maximum sustained winds of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a modern-day Category\u00a04 hurricane. Further strengthening ensued, and the hurricane peaked in intensity on September\u00a08 with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[2] After reaching peak intensity on September\u00a08, Carrie began to gradually weaken due to a decreasing pressure gradient caused by a trough that had cut through the Azores High.[1] By September\u00a011, the hurricane had degenerated into a Category\u00a01 hurricane.[2] A reconnaissance flight reported a minimum pressure of 984\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.06\u00a0inHg). At the same time, Carrie began to slowly curve towards the north in response to the trough.[1] The storm later began to slowly reintensify, reattaining major hurricane strength by 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013. The restrengthening of the subtropical ridge on September\u00a014 caused the hurricane to quickly curve towards the northwest.[1] National Hurricane Research Project (NHRP) observers described the hurricane as \"one of the most perfectly formed hurricanes they had seen.\"[1] Carrie began to steadily weaken again beginning on September\u00a015.[2] As it passed north of Bermuda the following day, weather radar imagery from the island indicated that the hurricane had an ill-defined structure, with its eye having expanded to 40\u201370\u00a0mi (64\u2013113\u00a0km) in diameter.[1] However, as it curved and accelerated eastward in response to a second trough of low pressure,[1] Carrie maintained hurricane intensity up until September\u00a023, when it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnant system continued eastwards until it dissipated over Ireland by 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a028.[2]"

Four other undamaged aircraft were called back to West Palm Beach, including a crippled ship, while two other B-50s were held at Bermuda.[11] Passing well north of the island on September\u00a016,[1] effects of Carrie on Bermuda were minimal, with peak gusts reaching only 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h).[12] The German barque Pamir, en route from Buenos Aires to Hamburg, Germany, encountered the hurricane southwest of the Azores on September\u00a021 while carrying barley cargo.[13] The ship sank due to the effects of Carrie, and 80\u00a0people out of the 86\u00a0crew members on board the ship perished.[1] The final message received from the Pamir was a distress call and indicated that the ship had lost all of its sails and had been listing at a 45\u00b0\u00a0angle.[14] A search and rescue operation ensued after the loss of the ship was reported, involving the U.S. Air Force and Navy, as well as the British Air Force and Navy. Other ships from Canada and Portugal were also involved in the search.[15] All associated groups were inconclusive in their findings, with no sign of debris left from the ship.[13] However, two lifeboats and a raft were found, but they were empty.[15] As an extratropical storm, Carrie impacted the Azores, though damages, if any, remain unknown. The extratropical remnants of Carrie later struck the British Isles on September\u00a024 and 25, causing strong winds, waves, and severe flooding.[1] Winds from the system were estimated at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).

The sixth named storm and eleventh tropical cyclone of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season, Fran developed from a tropical wave near Cape Verde on September\u00a015. It began as a tropical depression and gradually strengthened while tracking westward, remaining south of the Cape Verde archipelago. Late on September\u00a016, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fran, shortly before brushing Cape Verde, and then moving further out to sea. The storm approached hurricane status on September\u00a017 and September\u00a018, though it eventually weakened. Beginning on September\u00a019, Fran encountered strong wind shear, which contributed to further weakening. By September\u00a020, Fran dissipated well east of the Lesser Antilles. While passing southeast of Cape Verde, the storm produced torrential rainfall. At least 1,094\u00a0houses were severely damaged due to flooding, which left at least 2,100\u00a0people homeless. Significant damage also occurred to roads in the country, which was still in need of repairs as late as January\u00a01985. The hydraulic infrastructure was destroyed on six islands, requiring $1\u00a0million (1984\u00a0USD) in repairs. In addition, agriculture was extensively damaged, resulting in $1.84\u00a0million (1984\u00a0USD) in losses to crops. The storm caused no impact outside of Cape Verde. Overall, the storm caused about $2.84\u00a0million (1984\u00a0USD) in damage and between 29 and 32\u00a0fatalities.

The system rapidly organized, and at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, it developed into a tropical depression while located to the southeast of the Cape Verde.[1][2] Early on September\u00a016, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fran, based on intensity estimates via the Dvorak technique. By then, the storm had begun a track to the northwest; Fran then passed near the southernmost islands of Cape Verde. Late on September\u00a017, Fran attained peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.35\u00a0inHg). It maintained this intensity for about 24\u00a0hours,[2] during which time Fran turned to the west and later to the west-southwest due to high-pressure area located over the northeastern Atlantic.[3] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not upgrade the cyclone to Tropical Storm Fran until September\u00a018, after receiving confirmation from satellite imagery and sparse ship reports.[3] The NHC predicted late on September\u00a018 that Fran would slowly strengthen.[3] However, a strong upper-level trough and likely a cutoff low-pressure area instead generated strong wind shear over Fran on September\u00a019.[4] Consequently, the cyclone weakened as deep convection became detached center of the storm, with Fran falling to tropical depression status at 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020.[1] The NHC operationally downgraded the storm 10\u00a0hours later and predicted that Fran would likely dissipate by the next day.[4] Around 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, the storm dissipated while located about 1,250 miles (2,010\u00a0km) east-northeast of Antigua,[2] with the remnants becoming unidentifiable on September\u00a021.[1]"

The storm caused severe damage to at least 1,094\u00a0houses,[5] which left at least 2,100\u00a0people homeless.[6] On Santo Ant\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Nicolau, and Santiago, agriculture also suffered losses, totaling to $1.84\u00a0million (1984\u00a0USD). Fran also caused significant damage to roads, which still required repairs as late as January\u00a01985. The hydraulic infrastructure on Santo Ant\u00e3o, Santiago, S\u00e3o Nicolau, S\u00e3o Vicente, Fogo, and Maio was destroyed and cost about $1\u00a0million (1984\u00a0USD) to repair.[5] At least 29\u00a0people were killed,[6] though some sources claim there were as many as 32\u00a0fatalities.[5] Fran is thus the second deadliest tropical cyclone in the history of Cape Verde,[6] behind only Hurricane Debbie in 1961, which caused 60\u00a0fatalities after a plane crashed due to weather associated with the storm. Overall, the storm caused at least $2.84\u00a0million (1984\u00a0USD) in damage.[5] Although extensive impacts occurred due to flooding, rainfall generated by Fran refilled underground water reserves, improving agricultural aspects in Cape Verde, which had been suffering from a drought.[7] Elsewhere, the storm caused no damage or fatalities.[1] On October\u00a010, 1984, the Government of Cape Verde appealed for international assistance. Emergency relief aid requested included: two-month supply of food for 1,124\u00a0families, 1,064\u00a0mattresses, 532\u00a0kerosene stoves, 2,128\u00a0sets of dinner ware, 2,128\u00a0mugs, 1,064\u00a0cooking pots and pans, 532\u00a0water buckets, 2,128\u00a0sheets, 1,064\u00a0blankets, 2,660\u00a0articles of clothing, and building materials for repair of the 1,094\u00a0houses. In January\u00a01985, the government of Cape Verde announced that they had made significant progress with relief assistance. However, repairs to roads, infrastructure, and crops were still required. Five organizations contributed cash, including the National Solidarity Movement, the Cape Verde Red Cross, Chinese Red Cross, Oxfam Novib, and Oxfam of the United Kingdom; donations collectively totaled to $172,221 (1984\u00a0USD). France, Finland, the Soviet Union, and the United States supplied 4000\u00a0tons of cereals, $79,000 (1984\u00a0USD) to the Red Cross, $250,000 (1984\u00a0USD) for home repairs, 32\u00a0packages of medicines, and 17\u00a0packages of blankets.[5]"

        "content": "Although wildfire is a natural part of the ecosystem of western forests, fire suppression began to be widespread in the late 19th century just as land-use patterns (e.g. intensive grazing) limited the cover that had formerly sustained and been sustained by low-intensity ground fires. High-density stands of small trees and thick underbrush permitted a natural periodic ground fire to leap into a high-intensity crown fire. There followed a century of fire suppression, during which large fires occurred on the Pajarito Plateau about every 20 years: an 1896 fire, several fires in the 1920s, a fire in 1946, the 1954 Water Canyon Fire, the 1977 La Mesa Fire, and the 1996 Dome Fire. The 1977 La Mesa Fire served as the precedent for how destructive forest fires in the area could be and how compounding issues such as fuel buildup and lack of area survey were ignored leading up to the Cerro Grande Fire. It burned 15,000 acres (60\u00a0km2) in Bandelier National Monument, but accelerated a change in attitudes within the National Park Service toward managing fire. On Bandelier National Monument, firebreaks were improved, as were fuel breaks, and in some areas, trees were thinned. The 1996 Dome Fire burned 16,500 acres (67\u00a0km2) in nine days and threatened the southern section of Los Alamos National Laboratory.[3] The Interagency Wildfire Management Team was formed by representatives of Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos County, Bandelier National Monument, Santa Fe National Forest, State of New Mexico, and Pueblo agencies. The Pajarito Plateau saw high levels of precipitation throughout the early 1990s followed by a drought in the latter half of the decade. By 2000, conditions were ideal for a major forest fire on the plateau. Forest deadfall had a moisture content lower than that of well-cured firewood. The heavy rains and snows of the mid-1990s had produced luxuriant undergrowth, while the onset of drought toward the end of the decade had increased its flammability."

        "header": "Origin",
        "content": "The fire originated as a controlled burn that was part of the 10-year Bandelier National Monument plan for reducing fire hazard within the monument.[1] The starting point was high on Cerro Grande, a 10,200-foot (3110-m) summit on the rim of the Valles Caldera not far north of New Mexico State Road 4, the main highway through Los Alamos County. Like many mountains in the Jemez, Cerro Grande was mainly covered with coniferous forest, composed largely of Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir, and aspen trees, with a characteristic rincon (meadow) on its southern slopes near the summit. This grassy area also represented the headwaters of Frijoles Creek (Rito de los Frijoles), which flows southeast into Frijoles Canyon and on to the Rio Grande, passing en route the main tourist areas at Bandelier. The plan for the burn (see the NPS summary below) called for initial ignition (\"phase 1\") to be in the rincon, followed by flanking fires (\"phase 2\") along the slightly higher country east and west of Frijoles Creek. Ignition of the phase-1 burn was scheduled for May 4, 2000. In the aftermath of the disaster, Bandelier officials came under intense criticism for this plan, and particularly, for proceeding with it in the face of what appeared to be powerful contradictions. Ms Gary Jones, associate director of energy, resources, and science issues at the general accounting office, points out a lack of consideration toward fuel buildup in the park, nearby Santa Fe National Forest, and the thousands of people living in Los Alamos and surrounding communities.[2] The main point of contention was wind. In the springtime, the Jemez Mountains are prone to high winds and low humidity, which often create high to extreme fire danger. Critics insisted that the likelihood of such winds while the controlled burn was in progress was so great, and the risk of resulting loss of control so severe, that the burn should never have been attempted at that time of year. At the same time, Bandelier officials faced a most disagreeable dilemma. Proceeding with the burn risked disaster if control was lost, as indeed happened. However, not doing the burn might also have been disastrous because the entire southern slope of Cerro Grande was tinder-dry and ready to ignite catastrophically in the event of a lightning strike (hardly unusual in the Jemez in the spring) or human carelessness with fire. The same winds that militated against starting the controlled burn might then have driven the uncontrolled fire toward Los Alamos, with terrible consequences. In any case, the controlled burn was indeed initiated on May 4, and things rapidly got out of hand."

        "header": "Flash floods",
        "content": "A particular concern was the possibility of flooding in areas downstream from the burned zone. The town of Los Alamos, the national laboratory, and the lower parts of the burned area are all situated on the Pajarito Plateau, an area of extensive canyons and mesas in which surface runoff tends to concentrate in the canyon bottoms. This tendency was exacerbated in Cerro Grande's aftermath because the soil in the burned areas had become hydrophobic, raising the specter of drastically increased water flow in the streams in the canyons that the existing streambeds might not have been able to handle. This concern, coupled with the prospect of monsoon rains that typically begin in about July in the area, made dealing with the possibility of flooding urgent. The highest priority for flood management involved the Los Alamos Critical Experiments Facility (LACEF),[4] a remote site for conducting research in nuclear criticality safety that housed substantial quantities of special nuclear material. The LACEF laboratories were in the bottom of Pajarito Canyon. A month after the fire, a \"short-duration (30-minute), relatively moderate-intensity thunderstorm\"[5] caused a brief, heavy flood in this canyon upstream of LACEF. \"The maximum estimated peak flow in Pajarito Canyon upstream of State Road (SR) 501 was 1020 cfs, an all-time record for watersheds gaged by LANL on the Pajarito Plateau ...\"[5] To protect LACEF, a large, temporary \"dry dam\" was constructed in the canyon upstream of LACEF to temporarily contain flash floods that might result if an intense thunderstorm happened to rain heavily on the terrain drained by Pajarito Canyon. Runoff was monitored at multiple stations in the headwater streams above Pajarito Canyon. In the event, the monsoon of the summer of 2000 was not particularly intense, and damage from flooding was generally minimal. No severe flooding occurred in Pajarito Canyon before vegetation upstream had recovered sufficiently, over several years, to retain runoff, and the dry dam eventually was removed. Severe flooding did occur in upper Pueblo Canyon, significantly damaging Diamond Drive, one of the town's arterial roads. Water quality was monitored by LANL for several years in the aftermath of the fire.[5]"

Canyon bottoms in particular were clogged with fallen trees and boulders washed down from above. Erosion might have been far worse, had there not been timely intervention. A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team was assigned to assess the damage and to implement a rehabilitation plan to reduce further natural resource damage. During July 2000, about 7000 hydromulching and hydroseeding flights by air tractors were carried out on 1,600 acres (6.5\u00a0km2) of the burned area to reduce erosion and speed revegetation. A local trail work organization, Volunteer Task Force, devoted many thousands of hours to rebuilding trails and planting trees. Local school children made many thousands of \"seed balls\", which they broadcast in the burned areas to accelerate regrowth of the vegetation. To control erosion mechanically, Los Alamos County work crews laid thousands of trees across slopes, and chipped other trees."

Other problems arose from fire-generated soot that seeped into buildings, shorting out electrical equipment and clogging HEPA filters necessary to the operation of clean rooms at some of the laboratories. Resolving these problems took several years in some cases. Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mobilized to provide relief to the residents of Los Alamos who had been burned out of their homes.[6] A compound of portable buildings (\"trailers\"), known locally as FEMAville, was constructed on undeveloped land near the county rodeo grounds on North Mesa, providing housing for hundreds of displaced residents. Some residents complained about the timeliness and thoroughness of the FEMA response. The trailers became available only in late June 2000, after municipal utilities were completed and the trailers were delivered and hooked up to the utilities. By 2006, all the trailers were removed and most of the displaced residents were settled into new homes, although reconstruction of houses in the burned area continues as of 2008[update]. In 2007, the former FEMAville site was proposed as a full-service RV park. This proposal was soundly rejected by residents and the FEMAville acreage remains open space."

This initiative remains controversial, and its applicability to the relatively sparse forests of the Jemez Mountains that were consumed in the Cerro Grande Fire is unclear. Clearly, though, significant thinning of the coniferous forest of the Jemez has occurred in the years following Cerro Grande. The evaluation of the aftermath of this fire points to a bigger problem, loss of land to poor handling of natural resources. At the time of the fire, the area of logged forest amounted to 100,000 acres, this in comparison to forest lost from prescribed fires amounting to 2 and half million acres.[6] The GAO, Government Accountability Office, concluded that suppression tactics used by park service in response to fire were more apparently aimed at following through with the original goals of the prescribed fire and not minimizing the fire getting out of control.[7] The goal is to reduce the build up of dead wood and brush on the ground, called fuels, to minimize the risk of destructive wildfires spreading to surrounding communities.[8] The local community has also taken many steps to prevent and protect against future wildfires, including removing vegetation around buildings to increase defensible space, replacing roof and sheathing materials (e.g. cedar shakes) with less flammable materials, and continued thinning and reduction of fuels in unburned wooded areas in and around town, particularly in the canyons below populated mesas. Inferno by Committee, a detailed history of the fire and what went wrong, was published by firefighter Tom Ribe in 2010.[9]"

Passing near the islands, the system quickly organized into Tropical Storm Julia the next day. On September\u00a014, Julia attained hurricane status and subsequently entered a trend of rapid intensification; the storm strengthened from a minimal hurricane to a low-end Category\u00a04 in only 24\u00a0hours. After peaking in intensity, further development was impeded as interaction with nearby Hurricane Igor began to occur; the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm by September\u00a018. It subsequently moved into a region of unfavorable conditions, heading toward lower sea surface temperatures. Correspondingly, Julia entered an extratropical transition on September\u00a020, and advisories on the storm were discontinued by that time. As Julia never posed any significant threat to land, damage related to the storm was minimal. Trace amounts of rain reportedly fell across the Cape Verde islands, causing locally light flooding and minor inconveniences. Gusts battering the territory peaked at 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h), resulting in some wind damage to crops. In addition, these winds produced rough sea conditions, and high waves posed few threats along coastlines."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Julia trace back to a vigorous tropical wave, or an equatorward low-pressure area, which emerged into the Atlantic along the western coast of Africa on September\u00a011. At the time, the system maintained deep convection and strong easterly winds,[2] prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to commence tracking the system as an area of interest.[3] As the wave moved generally westward at 10 to 15\u00a0mph (16 to 24\u00a0km/h), a quick increase in organization as well as a significant drop in surface pressure became notable.[4] The system continued to organize, and several hours later, the NHC noted only a slight increase would suffice for the development of a tropical cyclone.[5] By September\u00a012, a tropical depression developed, and the NHC initiated advisories at 1500\u00a0UTC that day. At the time, the cyclone was situated 250\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km) southeast of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde.[6] For several hours, steady strengthening continued as the depression maintained a westward track. Operationally, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Julia early on September\u00a013, though post-analysis confirmed the storm had reached winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) twelve hours after formation.[2][7] For several hours, no significant change occurred in its intensity or organization as Julia passed near Cape Verde, though the storm gradually retraced to the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a deep-layer ridge. Slow intensification resumed as the storm bypassed the Cape Verde islands; by early September\u00a014, it displayed a ragged, banded eye-like feature in satellite imagery.[2] Due to locally high sea surface temperatures of about 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F), a period of rapid intensification subsequently commenced; within hours, Julia attained Category 1 hurricane status.[8] Though located over an area with relatively low oceanic heat content, Julia continued to intensify rapidly under low vertical wind shear and over favorable sea surface temperatures;[2] as such, the hurricane was upgraded to Category\u00a02 status on September 15.[9] In less than two hours, the hurricane deepened to reach Category\u00a03 intensity, becoming the fourth major hurricane of the season.[10] The rapid intensification trend continued, and Julia eventually strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane six hours later.[11] Based on satellite estimates, its winds peaked at 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 948\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.99\u00a0inHg), though operationally estimated at 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) and 950\u00a0mbar (950\u00a0hPa; 28\u00a0inHg), respectively.[11] Upon peaking in intensity, Julia accelerated slightly as it re-curved toward the northwest along a mid to upper-level low to its southwest. In addition, this system generated unfavorable southerly flow aloft, inducing a slight weakening of the storm. By early September\u00a016, Julia's eye became indistinguishable on satellite images, and the storm further dropped to below major hurricane status. Upon doing so, Julia became embedded within a south-southeasterly steering current along deep-layer ridging in its vicinity, resulting in a more westward track.[2] Though still a hurricane, the relatively small tropical system moved to the east of the much larger Hurricane Igor. Concurrently, Igor's outflow began impinging on Julia's circulation, and due to colder sea surface temperatures, the storm weakened below hurricane intensity late on September\u00a017. Henceforth, Julia re-accelerated as it further curved northward around the contiguous ridge,[2] nearly merging with Igor as a result. Progressively tracking to the north over the next hours, Julia subsequently executed a turn to the northeast, then to the east. Proceeding eastward, the low-level center of the storm became partially exposed on September 18; however, for several hours thereafter, convection gradually redeveloped over its center.[2] Despite the deep convection, vertical wind shear again increased over the system, causing the storm to enter an extratropical transition. It is estimated Julia degenerated into a post-tropical low by 1800 UTC on September 20, while located about 1,095\u00a0mi (1,762\u00a0km) west of the Azores.[12] The resultant storm meandered around over the Atlantic for several days, continuing generally eastward before executing an elongated loop to the south. Following this erratic track, the remnants of Hurricane Julia proceeded northwestward and came within 350\u00a0mi (560\u00a0km) of Bermuda, where they were once again briefly monitored by the NHC. However, chance of redevelopment dwindled, as conditions were not conducive for tropical formation;[13] convection nearly diminished entirely, and the NHC discontinued monitoring the system on September 28.[14]"

In response, the Government of Cape Verde issued a tropical storm warning for the southern portion of the archipelago, which included Maio, Sao Tiago, Fogo, and Brava.[6] The tropical storm warning remained in effect after Julia intensified into a tropical storm; it was finally discontinued early on September 14. Since Julia stayed at sea and never directly struck land as a significant cyclone, there were no reports of major damage or casualties. Across southern Cape Verde, intermittent rains and some gusty winds were reported when the storm neared the islands.

An area of disturbed weather developed near the equator and the Caroline Islands on October\u00a028. Following an increase in organization, the cyclone was designated a tropical storm on October\u00a031. After tracking northwest initially, Agnes turned west-northwest the next day, a course that the system would maintain for the rest of its lifetime. Agnes intensified into a typhoon on November\u00a02, and on November\u00a04, attained peak intensity. The storm then made landfall on Samar Island, part of the Philippines, at that intensity. The storm weakened over land, but re-intensified over the South China Sea; Agnes obtained a secondary peak intensity on November\u00a06. The next day, Typhoon Agnes moved ashore Vietnam while still at typhoon intensity. The storm rapidly deteriorated over land and dissipated by November\u00a08 over Thailand. Typhoon Agnes was the final of a series of tropical cyclones to affect the Philippines that season, following June, Ike, and Warren. Agnes brought widespread damage to several provinces across the central section of the archipelago. In the Iloilo province, 230 people were killed and four others were injured. Provincewide, a total of 21\u00a0homes were flattened, resulting in 1,326\u00a0homeless people. Damage in the province amounted to at least $5\u00a0million. Approximately 20% of the rice crop was destroyed in Iloilo. In the Capiz province, 265\u00a0people died and property damage amounted $25\u00a0million (1984 USD). Around 80% of houses in Roxas, located in Capiz, were damaged and 100\u00a0people were killed. Throughout Panay Island, four hundred forty-eight fatalities were reported, at least eight people were injured, five bridges were destroyed, and thirty-five schools were demolished. A total of 4,014\u00a0homes were destroyed; consequently, over 24,000\u00a0people lost their homes. Across the Philippines, 895\u00a0people died due to Agnes, with 272 people listed missing and 2,526\u00a0others wounded. A total of 491,968\u00a0people were evacuated to shelter in 27\u00a0provinces. More than 200,000\u00a0homes were destroyed while 163,056\u00a0other dwellings were damaged. Damage in the country totaled $90.7\u00a0million, with $19.1\u00a0million from crops and $56.9\u00a0million from public infrastructure. In Vietnam, the typhoon severely affected the rice harvest and winter crop cultivation. The B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province suffered the brunt of the typhoon, where 134\u00a0people died and 289\u00a0sustained injuries. There, 400\u00a0schools and 230\u00a0nurseries were flattened.

        "content": "Typhoon Agnes originated from an isolated area of convection located near the equator on October\u00a028. Satellite imagery indicated a possible low pressure area near 149\u00b0 E. Although the disturbance was not attached to the monsoon trough, an upper-level anticyclone became situated aloft, providing the system with strong ventilation.[1] Midday on October\u00a030, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system,[2] with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgrading the system to a tropical depression on the same day.[nb 1][4] Late on October\u00a031, shower activity increased drastically in both coverage and organization as the disturbance tracked northwest. Early the next day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Shortly thereafter, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system and found winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph); these winds were significantly higher than intensity estimates from the Dvorak technique. At 06:00 UTC on November\u00a01, the JTWC issued its first warning on the system, upgrading it to a tropical storm and naming it Agnes.[1] The JMA also classified Agnes as a tropical storm at this time.[nb 2][6] Although Agnes initially continued to track northwest,[1] passing through the Caroline Islands,[7] by the evening of November 1, Agnes moved northward enough to feel the effects of a subtropical ridge anchored to its north, causing the storm to turn west-northwest. Despite its asymmetric structure,[1] the JTWC classified Agnes as a typhoon midday on November\u00a02.[2] The storm began to rapidly intensify on November 3, with the JMA upping Agnes to a severe tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC, and to a typhoon six hours later. Meanwhile, the JTWC elevated the intensity to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), which would make it a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). That afternoon, however, the typhoon began to level off in strength.[6] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Undang.[8] After developing a small 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) wide eye, at 18:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a04, the JTWC increased the winds to 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), equal to Category 4 intensity on the SSHWS, its peak intensity.[1] At the same time, the JMA estimated peak intensity of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[4] Shortly after attaining maximum intensity, the typhoon continued west-northwest and made landfall 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) south of Borongan on Samar Island. Land interaction resulted in a weakening trend as it crossed the archipelago; however, due to its brisk forward motion, the JTWC reported that Agnes was still a typhoon when it emerged into the South China Sea,[1] though the JMA estimated it weakened into a severe tropical storm over land.[6] Over water, Agnes re-intensified, with the JMA designating it a typhoon again on the morning of November\u00a06.[4] Later that day, the agency estimated the storm attained its secondary peak intensity of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated that the storm regained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), an intensity that the storm would maintain until Agnes made its second landfall on November\u00a07 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Qui Nh\u01a1n in Vietnam. Rapid weakening occurred over land, and at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a08, the JTWC ceased following Agnes[1] as it had tracked into Thailand.[7] Thirty hours later, the JMA followed suit.[4]"

        "content": " Hurricane Fred was the easternmost Atlantic hurricane to form in the tropics, and the first to move through Cape Verde since 1892.[1] The second hurricane and sixth named storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Fred originated from a well-defined tropical wave over West Africa in late August\u00a02015. Once offshore, the wave moved northwestward within a favorable tropospheric environment and strengthened into a tropical storm on August\u00a030. The following day, Fred grew to a Category\u00a01 hurricane with peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) as it approached Cape Verde. After passing Boa Vista and moving away from Santo Ant\u00e3o, it entered a phase of steady weakening, dropping below hurricane status by September\u00a01. Fred then turned to the west-northwest, enduring increasingly hostile wind shear, but maintained its status as a tropical cyclone despite repeated forecasts of rapid dissipation. It fluctuated between minimal tropical storm and tropical depression strength through September\u00a04\u20135 before curving sharply to the north. By September\u00a06, Fred's circulation pattern had diminished considerably, and the storm dissipated later that day. Under threat from the hurricane, all of Cape Verde was placed under a hurricane warning for the first time in the nation's history. Gale-force winds battered much of the Barlavento region throughout August\u00a031, downing trees and utility poles. On the easternmost islands of Boa Vista and Sal, Fred leveled roofs and left villages without power or phone services for a few days. About 70\u00a0percent of the houses in Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o Velha suffered light to moderate damage. Across the northernmost islands, rainstorms flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined farmland; S\u00e3o Nicolau endured great losses of crops and livestock. Material damage across Cape Verde totaled US$2.5\u00a0million,[nb 1] though the rain's overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing. Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in Senegal. Between the coasts of West Africa and Cape Verde, maritime incidents related to Fred resulted in nine deaths."

        "content": "Early on August\u00a028, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an unusually vigorous tropical wave\u2014an elongated area of low air pressure\u2014inland over West Africa.[1][3] Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked toward the open Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline.[4] The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00\u00a0UTC, August\u00a029. By that time, the NHC was predicting favorable conditions for the development of a tropical cyclone within the next 48\u00a0hours.[5] Strong thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center;[6][7] around midnight August\u00a030, satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression with sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) had formed about 300\u00a0miles (480\u00a0km) west-northwest of Conakry.[1][8] Although tropical cyclones in the extreme eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by high pressures from the North Atlantic subtropical ridge,[9] this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance.[1][8] Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband tightened around the center, resembling the precursor to an eye.[10] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred while 390\u00a0mi (625\u00a0km) east-southeast of Praia, Cape Verde[1]\u2014among the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record-keeping began in 1851.[10] A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light upper winds, and above-average sea surface temperatures.[11] The storm developed a thick, circular central dense overcast with good outflow, and the eye feature became well established at all levels of the circulation.[12][13] Based on these characteristics, as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) winds, Fred was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane at 00:00\u00a0UTC, August\u00a031. Then centered 165\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) east-southeast of Sal, Cape Verde,[1] it became the easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in the tropical Atlantic.[nb 2][15] A compact cyclone, Fred quickly reached its peak strength as a hurricane, with a minimum central pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.12\u00a0inHg) and 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) winds.[1] Through the rest of August\u00a031, the hurricane traversed the Barlavento Islands of Cape Verde, barely skirting the southern coast of Boa Vista around 12:00\u00a0UC.[16] Gradually decreasing in definition, the eye passed north of S\u00e3o Nicolau and then north-northeast of Santo Ant\u00e3o over the next 12\u00a0hours.[17][18] On September\u00a01, drier air and stronger wind shear aloft dispersed the convection around the cyclone's core, causing Fred to diminish to a tropical storm.[19] The weakened storm turned slightly toward the west-northwest, over considerably cooler waters, in response to high pressure rebuilding to its north.[20][21] Through much of September\u00a01\u20134, Fred produced limited convective activity, with intermittent flares of thunderstorms that were continuously blown away from the center by the strong upper winds. Despite the adverse environment and the storm's lack of stable convection, Fred maintained a robust spiral of low-level clouds and gales during this period, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation.[22] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04, the NHC downgraded Fred to a tropical depression as its wind circulation waned; though its winds briefly picked up back to tropical storm force the next day, Fred continued as a depression with minimal convection throughout the remainder of its existence.[1] Concurrently, a deep-altitude disturbance a few hundred miles east of Bermuda began to erode the southern edge of the high-pressure ridge that Fred had circumnavigated for most of its journey.[23] This changed the steering pattern in the region, turning the depression abruptly to the north on September\u00a06.[23][24] Over the next hours, Fred became increasingly diffuse because of its progressively worsening surroundings.[25] It officially lost its status as a tropical cyclone at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, degenerating into a surface trough about 1,200\u00a0mi (1,950\u00a0km) to the southwest of the Azores before merging with the disturbance off Bermuda.[1]"

Along the shorelines between Dakar and M'Bour, rough surf devastated entire fishing districts and harbor towns, stranding boats and damaging roads and bridges. About 200\u00a0houses were demolished in the district of Hann, many of which experienced total wall collapse; dwellings in the town of Bargny endured similar destruction.[26][27] In the suburb of Rufisque, the waves overtopped dams, entered homes and cemeteries, and destroyed a mosque.[28] Several villages outside the capital area were completely cut off from their surroundings.[28] Victims across the affected region received more than 100\u00a0tons (220,000\u00a0lbs) of rice and 12\u00a0million CFA francs (US$20,000) in government relief funds.[29] Farther south, in Guinea-Bissau, a storm surge flooded roads and low-lying establishments, such as offices and military barracks. The sea water submerged vast amounts of cropland in the Tombali Region, resulting in great losses of rice.[30] Offshore, waves as high as 23\u00a0feet (7\u00a0m) capsized a fishing boat with a crew of 19; twelve members were rescued, but the remaining seven disappeared at sea and were presumed dead.[31]"

When Fred showed definitive signs of strengthening, the alerts were replaced by a hurricane warning,[1] marking the first occasion of a hurricane-level advisory in the nation's history.[32] On the morning of August\u00a031, TACV Cabo Verde Airlines suspended its flights from the capital of Praia to Dakar;[33] all operations at the airports of Boa Vista, Sal, and S\u00e3o Vicente were halted when squalls began to spread across the islands.[34] Officials urged shipping interests on all islands to secure their vessels and remain in port.[35] A national music festival was canceled in Porto Novo, on the northernmost island of Santo Ant\u00e3o.[36] Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred displaced more than 50\u00a0families[37] and caused CVE$250\u00a0million ($2.5\u00a0million) in damage,[27][38] primarily to the agricultural and private sectors of the Barlavento Islands.[37] It was the first hurricane to move through Cape Verde with a documented impact,[nb 3] as well as the nation's only record of onshore hurricane-force winds.[27] Although there were no casualties on land,[37] two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead.[39] Despite the losses in crops and livestock in the Barlavento region, the rainfall from Fred had a generally positive effect on the large-scale agriculture of Cape Verde, refilling rivers and reservoirs and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento Islands.[40][41]"

Along the island's southern shore, Fred's storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed the island's main tourist pier in Santa Maria.[46] Restoration efforts had not yet been completed by May\u00a02017, about 1.5\u00a0years after the hurricane; the delay led to concerns over the island's precarious, tourism-reliant economy.[47][48] Hotels, restaurants, and beach facilities were flooded, and roads in the town became impassable. Gusts leveled the roof of a high school gym,[42] which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100\u00a0citizens.[46] Elsewhere on the island, the winds knocked out power to homes in Palmeira,[42] and caused minor structural damage to Sal International Airport.[49] At the height of the storm, floods forced nearly 130\u00a0people living in the impoverished outskirts of Terra Boa and Espargos to relocate to shelters.[42][50] Fred destroyed 80\u00a0percent of the Loggerhead sea turtle nests on the beaches of Sal, crucial nesting sites for the species.[51] Overall, the hurricane left CVE$30\u00a0million ($300,000) in damage across Sal.[27] Fred produced strong winds and downpours across the mountainous northern islands of Barlavento. S\u00e3o Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h)\u2014the highest official wind speed recorded during hurricane. Rainfall there was moderate, peaking at 3.5\u00a0in (90\u00a0mm) at Juncalinho.[27] The blustery weather uprooted many old trees, triggered landslides, and left the villages on the island without power.[27][52] The strong winds downed power poles and wrecked the roof of a church in the village of Cabe\u00e7alinho.[53] In Ribeira Brava, S\u00e3o Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70\u00a0homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farmhouse, leaving some families homeless and others without a source of income.[54] In Carri\u00e7al, the torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and hydroponic crops.[55] Much of S\u00e3o Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from Hortel\u00e3, was lost in the storm.[53][56] Damage to agriculture\u2014primarily banana and sugarcane[52]\u2014and private property on the island reached CVE$50\u00a0million ($500,000).[27] On the neighboring islands of S\u00e3o Vicente and Santo Ant\u00e3o, the storm's impact was limited to power outages, floods, and damaged crops.[57] Santo Ant\u00e3o recorded light winds and 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of rain,[41] although higher elevations received greater quantities.[27] In Porto Novo, 35\u00a0people were relocated as floods swept through neighborhoods.[58] The rain washed out the island's carrot, cabbage, and tomato plantations, especially in the vicinity of Alto Mira.[59] On S\u00e3o Vicente, roads were closed in and around Laginha. Gusts toppled two trees, one striking a car and lightly injuring the driver.[60] Hurricane-related costs for the two islands, mainly infrastructural repair, totaled CVE$16\u00a0million ($160,000).[27]"

The government declared Monday, June 23, a day of national mourning.[8] In a message to the Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev, the President of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso promised to mobilize all available instruments to help the country.[20] According to EU legislation, for emergency funds to be activated a disaster needs to inflict damage of three billion Euros (by 2002 inflation rates) or more than 0.6% of the country's GDP. In the case of Bulgaria this means confirmed damages of at least 232,5 million Euros.[21] On June 24, officials announced that preliminary damage estimates in Veliko Tarnovo Province alone were over 10 million leva (5,1 million Euros).[2] Damage to the country's road infrastructure was estimated at around 15 million leva (7,7 million Euros), including about 1.5 million leva to reopen the Pass of the Republic.[3] On June 27, Varna Province officials announced that damage to local infrastructure there was estimated to be at least 30 million leva (15.25 million Euros).[4] Starting from June 24, officials in Varna began evacuating around 250 Asparuhovo residents from 85 buildings deemed too dangerous to live in, including at least 11 that would be demolished immediately. Due to the extreme amount of precipitation, measures were taken to stabilize parts of the hillside in the area for fears it might collapse in a landslide.[22] Water service was fully restored to Asparuhovo on June 25, although officials announced they will continue to monitor the chemical composition of water within the city of Varna for at least a few weeks.[23] By June 27, the number of evacuation orders in Asparuhovo had risen to 132, covering more than 1,000 residents of the neighborhood.[4] On June 20 the organizers of Sofia Pride announced they would postpone the 7th edition of the event, scheduled for the day after, in solidarity with the victims of the floods. They also appealed to citizens to actively contribute to the ongoing relief effort.[24] Dozens of fans of Levski (Sofia) and CSKA (Sofia) both urged supporters to donate via the text-messaging campaign and promised to organize help on the ground as well.[25] On June 23 a spokesman for the Bulgarian Army announced that a total of 860 people had been rescued or evacuated by various units across the country.[26] Relatives of people killed in the floods were to receive an immediate one-time government package of 10,000 leva (~5,113 Euros).[27] Within hours of the event, a donation campaign was set up through which citizens could contribute funds by sending text messages to a special numbers. By mid-afternoon on June 20 over 190,000 such texts had been sent, raising a few hundred thousand leva for victims of the floods.[5] By June 24, a total of 832,948 Leva (~425,600 Euros) had been gathered as part of the relief efforts, with about 80% of those coming from text messages and the rest being donated via bank accounts. Authorities estimated the total numbers of families that would require long-term help at around 800, spread across Varna, Dobrich and Veliko Tarnovo provinces.[28] Several dozen Syrian refugees traveled from camps in the capital Sofia and Harmanli to Varna, answering a call by the local municipality for volunteers to help with the clean-up effort.[29]"

        "content": " Hurricane Elsa was a deadly and destructive tropical cyclone that affected many countries along its path during the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the earliest-forming fifth named storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean, and the first hurricane of the season. It formed over the central tropical Atlantic, farther east in the Main Development Region than any June storm at the time, except for the 1933 Trinidad hurricane.[1] Originating from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on June\u00a027, the disturbance become organized as a tropical depression on June 30, about 1,150\u00a0mi (1,850\u00a0km) east-southeast of Barbados, and strengthened to a tropical storm soon thereafter. Then, riding the south edge of a strong subtropical ridge, Elsa moved swiftly westward on July\u00a01, while rapidly intensifying. The storm strengthened to a hurricane around 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a02, as its center moved just south of Barbados, and then reached its peak intensity six hours later with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 991\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg), about 95\u00a0mi (155\u00a0km) west-northwest of Saint Vincent. This made Elsa the strongest July hurricane recorded in the eastern Caribbean Sea since Emily in 2005.[2] On July\u00a03, Elsa weakened back into a tropical storm before slowing down by July\u00a04, as it passed just north of Jamaica. On July\u00a05, Elsa made landfall in Cuba, before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico early on the next day. It then paralleled the west coast of Florida, briefly becoming a minimal hurricane again as it passed west of Tampa, early on July\u00a07. Elsa then weakened back to a tropical storm, before making landfall later that day in Taylor County, Florida, with maximum winds of about 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). Afterward, Elsa began accelerating northeastward across the southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, restrengthening slightly due to its proximity to the Atlantic. Elsa emerged back over water off New Jersey early on July\u00a09, and moved over eastern Long Island and western Rhode Island, before becoming extratropical at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, while moving through New England. Afterward, Elsa's extratropical remnant accelerated northeastward and slowly weakened. The storm dissipated over Atlantic Canada on July\u00a010. Altogether there were 13 deaths associated with Elsa: nine in the Florida Straits, two in the Dominican Republic, one in Martinique, and one in the United States. As Elsa raced past the Lesser Antilles, it caused extensive damage on several islands. In Barbados, the storm brought down trees, damaged roofs, caused widespread power outages, and caused flash flooding. Its main impact in Cuba was flash flooding and mudslides. The storm caused widespread damage throughout the U.S., especially in the Northeast. Atlantic Canada experienced many outages and high amounts of rainfall from a post-tropical Elsa. The storm dealt upwards of $1.2 billion in damages in the United States, with additional damage in the Caribbean.[3] Upon its naming, Elsa received widespread social media attention, due to the storm sharing its name with the Disney character Elsa from the Frozen franchise.[4][5][6]"

        "content": "On June 27, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa and tracked quickly westward across the Atlantic Ocean. The wave produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms during the next few days, before a closed and well-defined low pressure system developed by 18:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a030, marking the formation of a tropical depression about 1,150\u00a0mi (1,850\u00a0km) east-southeast of Barbados. The potential for tropical cyclone formation within the wave was first noted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) at 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a029, and initially given a low (less than 40%) chance of development over the next five days. The 5-day chance of formation was raised to high (greater than 60%) at 06:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a030.[1] Later that day, after the system had moved to near the Lesser Antilles and was expected to become a tropical storm before reaching the islands, the disturbance was designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Five at 21:00\u00a0UTC.[7] However, the system became a tropical cyclone according to post-season analysis three hours before that initial advisory. The depression strengthened to a tropical storm by 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a01, while about 980\u00a0mi (1,575\u00a0km) east-southeast of Barbados, and named Elsa.[1] This made Elsa the earliest fifth-named Atlantic storm in recorded history, surpassing Tropical Storm Edouard of 2020 by five days; it also became only the third tropical storm on record to form so early in the season east of 50\u00b0W, after the 1933 Trinidad hurricane and Tropical Storm Bret in 2023.[8][9] Elsa became better organized, forming better-defined banding features on the western and southwestern portions of the storm. Well-defined upper-level outflow was produced on the western side of the cyclone, although outflow was ill-defined on the eastern half. Steered by a strong subtropical ridge to its north, the system moved swiftly westward at speeds of around 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h).[10] During the same period of time, Elsa began a period of rapid intensification. By early on July\u00a02, microwave and radar data indicated that a small inner core had formed, and surface observations from the southern portion of Barbados, which was estimated to be within the radius of Elsa's maximum wind, reported sustained winds of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) and a gust to 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h), and Elsa strengthened to a hurricane as the center moved just south of Barbados around 1200 UTC that day.[1][11] The first hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, its formation came more than a month before the average appearance of the season's first hurricane.[12] Six hours later, Elsa reached its peak intensity with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 991\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg), while located about 95\u00a0mi (155\u00a0km) west-northwest of Saint Vincent. This was the culmination of a 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) intensification over a 24-hour period. Elsa's forward speed increased while it moved across the eastern and central Caribbean Sea early on July 3, but the low-level center became exposed to the west of the main area of deep convection, and it weakened into a tropical storm about 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) south of the southern coast of the Dominican Republic.[1] The storm continued to lose strength later that day and early on July 4, as the center passed offshore but near the mountainous terrain of southwestern Haiti and then just north of Jamaica.[13][14] An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft investigating Elsa late on July 4, found it to be undergoing a convective burst and beginning to restrengthen.[15] At 18:00 UTC on July 5, Elsa made landfall on the south coast of Cuba in Cienaga de Zapata National Park with maximum winds of about 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[1] Several hours later, at 02:00\u00a0UTC on July 6, Elsa emerged into the Straits of Florida, where it began to regain its strength.[16] The storm once more became a hurricane at 00:00 UTC on July 7, about 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) west of Englewood, Florida, but weakened back into a tropical storm six hours later.[1] This weakening was likely caused by a combination of wind shear and an entrainment of dry air.[17] Elsa then accelerated northward, and it made landfall in Taylor County, Florida, at 14:30 UTC that same day with maximum winds of about 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[1] Following landfall, Elsa turned northeastward and gradually began to weaken, though the storm continued to maintain tropical storm intensity. Most of its convection, however, was in a band in the eastern semicircle over the nearby Atlantic Ocean.[18] The center of the storm emerged over the Atlantic off New Jersey early on July 9. After moving northeastward and making landfall on eastern Long Island and western Rhode Island, Elsa became a post-tropical cyclone by 18:00\u00a0UTC that same day while over southeastern New England. Elsa's extratropical remnant accelerated northeastward and slowly weakened. The storm dissipated over Atlantic Canada before 12:00\u00a0UTC July\u00a010.[1]"

They urged coastal and mountainous communities to evacuate. The Civil Protection Agency said that the \"whole country [was] threatened.\"[59] The country's president had just been assassinated amid a spike in gang violence in the country,[60] and as the violence forced thousands from their homes, food and water shortages exacerbated these problems. Director Jerry Chandler told the Associated Press that officials are still figuring out how to send supplies to Haiti's southern region.[59]"

There were also two more Tropical Storm Watches put in place. One was issued for the Florida Keys from Craig Key to Ocean Reef (Key Largo). The other watch was issued for an area from Flamingo to Bonita Beach.[61] On July 2, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 15 counties within the state.[62] Officials planned to protect on-site equipment being used to search for survivors of the Surfside condo collapse, which was underway at the time.[63] DeSantis also expressed his concern that high winds from Elsa could cause further collapse of the structure.[64] As a result, rescue teams suspended their search for the remaining 121 people missing, and, on the night of July 4, demolished the remaining portion of the condominium.[65] On the same day, President Joe Biden approved the emergency declaration and federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as Elsa moved closer to the south Florida coast.[66] Mandatory evacuations were underway in Monroe and Indian River counties as the storm approached, and Franklin, Dixie, Hernando, and Hillsborough counties had voluntary evacuations. The state was projected to have enough resources to provide for the forecasted impacts.[67] Multiple sandbags were given out at several locations for locals to use for protection. A couple storm shelters also opened on the morning of July 6, in at least four counties around the Tampa Bay area. No evacuations were ordered, though. Several events, government offices, and schools were cancelled and closed in advance of the approaching storm as well. Tampa International Airport temporarily suspended operations on the same day due to the storm, reopening the next morning, with Sarasota Bradenton International Airport following suit.[68][69] The De Soto National Memorial was closed by the National Park Service on July 5 in preparation of the storm.[70] Georgia Governor Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency for 92 counties. This allowed state aid.[71] Over 50 million were under flash flood watches from the Carolinas to Maine, including cities Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.[72] They also extended out to Canada.

This prompted city and county officials to ask citizens in flood prone areas to consider evacuation.[152] This flooding forced the rescue of several people from floodwaters, after they drove their vehicles into flooded streets. This prompted the State Emergency Response Team of Florida's Region 6 Strike team to return from Surfside, where they had been helping with recovery and clean up efforts following the Surfside condo collapse.[153] Governor Ron DeSantis reported that no serious injuries or fatalities were recorded in the Bay area. He said that damage in the state was \"less than what we thought would be reasonable\" from \"where we looked 72 hours ago\". Up to 26,000 customer were without power in the area, most of them in Hillsborough, Pinellas, and Polk counties.[154] In Lee County, a police Bloodhound dog named Mercy found a missing 12-year-old girl.

The system was responsible for flooding rains across many areas in California along with very strong winds locally exceeding hurricane force strength as well as heavy mountain snows across the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain chains as well as those in Idaho, Utah and Colorado. The storms were responsible for the death of at least 12 people across three states, and extensive damage to utility services as well, as damage to some other structures.

        "content": "The strong low-pressure system responsible for much of the extreme weather  traversed much of the Pacific Ocean, before the first storm arrived late on January 3. (This storm was actually a part of a series of three storms.) On December 29, 2007, a powerful extratropical disturbance developed over eastern Siberia, which emerged into the northwest Pacific, and moved to the Aleutian Islands as a well-defined low by January 3. On January 2, another extratropical disturbance developed within a well-defined trough of low pressure, in the northeast Pacific Ocean.[8] On January 3, the 1st storm system approached the northern part of the West Coast, powered by a Pineapple Express atmospheric river, resulting in heavy downpours of rain and strong gusts across much of the Western Seaboard.[9] Late on January 3, the 2nd storm system in the Gulf of Alaska split, with the 3rd, new storm to the south usurping the majority of the moisture of the 2nd system.[10] On January 4, as the 1st storm system weakened, and the southern part of the storm split off into another storm, which began moving eastward across the Southern United States.[11] Later on the same day, as the first storm began moving ashore in British Columbia,[12] the 3rd (and the most powerful) storm brought the largest bands of snow and rain, which impacted the Pacific Coast from British Columbia to northern Mexico, on January 4. Heavy downpours of rain, heavy snow, and fierce winds lashed the West Coast.[4] Meanwhile, the 2nd storm system slowly moved eastward along the southern coast of Alaska, before stalling in the Gulf of Alaska on January 5.[13] From January 4 to 5, general rainfall from the superstorm in the West Coast was around 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) of rain in Oregon and Utah, while nearly 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) fell over parts of Nevada and as much as 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) in parts of California. Snowfall amounts for those two days reached as much as 70 inches (1,800\u00a0mm) in Blackcap Basin, California, while many mountain regions of California, Nevada and Idaho received between 1 and 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) of snow. By this time, the 3rd storm's explosive intensification had transformed the system into a massive superstorm, becoming the dominant system in the Western US. Widespread hurricane-force wind gusts were reported across most western states with winds reaching speeds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) or more.[14] The highest reported wind gusts were 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h) in Tahoe City, California, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson scale.[4][15] Waves were reported as high as 37.7 feet (11.5\u00a0m) offshore Washington State.[5] Early on January 5, the superstorm reached a minimum low pressure of 956 millibars (28.2\u00a0inHg) - the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane, becoming the most powerful storm on record to affect the West Coast, in terms of low pressure.[2] Later on the same day, the 3rd storm began to interact with the 1st storm, which was situated over northwestern Canada, weakening that system.[16] Also, the superstorm slowly began to weaken, and it developed a secondary low to the north of Montana, as the system gradually began to split.[17] Late on January 6, the superstorm's secondary low became the dominant low in the system, as the storm system's circulation began to break down.[18] On January 6, the superstorm's original low pressure center was absorbed into the 2nd storm, located just south of Alaska, while the main bulk of the storm system continued moving eastward, across Western Canada.[19] However, the western chunk of the storm complex's moisture continued to dump rain and snow across the Western US. On the afternoon of January 6, Kirkwood Ski Resort reported 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) of snow in 48 hours with a storm total of 11 feet.[3] On January 7, the storm complex weakened further, and the circulation in the western half of the storm completely collapsed, resulting in the storm's moisture spreading out throughout most of the Western United States. Soon afterwards, a few clumps of the mass of moisture organized into separate storm systems,[20] while the dominant low over Canada stalled just southwest of Hudson Bay. As the storm complex moved westward on January 7, the instability in the air triggered a rare January tornado outbreak, spawning 55 tornadoes over the course of 2 days, resulting in the deaths of 4 more people. On January 8, the western fragment of the complex in the US dissipated, while the southern and eastern chunks continued to organize.[21] On the same day, the 2nd storm system in the Gulf of Alaska was absorbed by another more powerful incoming extratropical cyclone, even as the main storm complex continued heading eastward across the United States.[22] Later on January 8, the eastern chunk of the storm complex merged into the southern chunk, while the low near Hudson Bay began to deteriorate.[23] On January 9, the low pressure center over the Great Lakes region became the dominant low of the storm complex.[24] On the same day, the 1st storm over northern Canada was absorbed by a cold front, even as the storm complex continued to organize over the Eastern United States, triggering more tornadoes across the region.[25] By January 9, the storm complex had organized into a 973\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg) storm to the northeast of the Great Lakes, and it began to strip away moisture from the low near Hudson Bay.[26] The storm complex slowly moved northeastward, and the storm's outer rainband eventually exited the East Coast. On January 10, the low west of Hudson Bay dissipated, while the main storm complex began to exit Atlantic Canada.[27] On January 11, the storm entered Labrador Sea,[28] and stalled for several hours, before continuing to move northeastward. At the same time, the system gradually weakened. On January 12, the system reorganized to the southeast of Greenland, and was assigned the name Ilse by the Free University of Berlin.[29] On January 14, Windstorm Ilse intensified to 980 millibars (29\u00a0inHg) and impacted the United Kingdom and parts of Western Europe, before entering the Norwegian Sea on January 15.[30] During the next couple of days, Ilse accelerated northeastward,[31] before turning to the east on January 17.[32] On January 22, Ilse was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone to the south, over the Barents Sea.[1]"

Bay Area Rapid Transit was also disrupted with significant delays to service and was even interrupted between San Francisco and Daly City briefly due to fallen trees on the network's tracks.[33] Strong winds knocked power lines down causing power outages for 1.2 million Californians,[7] while several outages were reported in Washington and Oregon.[34] About 500 miles (800\u00a0km) of California power lines were damaged by the storm.[35] The storm closed ski resorts, toppled trees, and created mudslides. Highways from Sacramento to San Francisco were closed by debris. Meteorologists predicted about 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) of snow by the end of the storms giving hope to Californians for more water for the year of 2008 following a drier than average 2007 water season and leading to an expected water shortage in 2008. Mandatory evacuations were ordered in Orange County in Southern California.[36] On January 5, a canal levee ruptured near Reno, Nevada and flooded some 800 residences.[37]  At least 3000 people were rescued by helicopter from rooftops of flooded homes while cold temperatures hindered rescue efforts.[38] Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons declared a state of emergency for Lyon County.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency was called in for emergency assistance and distribution of food and water. Bank firm Wells Fargo opened an account to collect donations for the residents of Fernley. Residents began returning home on January 7.[39][40] California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger also declared a state of emergency for three counties while Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski declared a state of emergency for Umatilla County due to wind damage. At least 12 people were killed including two in California, eight in Utah and two in Oregon due to falling branches or trees, traffic accidents, and flooding.[41][42][43][44] Eight of the fatalities were caused by the rollover of a charter bus in southeastern Utah.[45]\n7 people in one California home were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning from a lantern.[46] Several other people, including snowmobilers and skiers, were missing in the mountain regions of Colorado. Six snowmobilers were later found alive after calling for emergency services from a train station. A hiker went missing in the San Bernardino Mountains.[47][48][49] According to an analysis conducted by meteorologists, a storm of this intensity had not struck California since the 1997\u20131998 North American winter storm season (as of December 2009).[citation needed]"

By August\u00a018, an associated area of low pressure developed sufficient convective activity to be declared a tropical depression. Later that day, the system intensified into a tropical storm before moving inland over the Yucatan Peninsula. Brenda had moved back over water by August\u00a021 and began to quickly intensify, with an eye forming later that day. The storm peaked as an upper-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) before making landfall in Campeche. The hurricane rapidly weakened after moving over land and dissipated the following day. Brenda made two landfalls in Mexico: first in the Yucatan and later in Campeche. Little damage resulted from the storm throughout the Yucatan Peninsula. However, severe damage took place in areas near Brenda's second landfall. A total of 10 people were killed by the hurricane and over 2,000 more were left homeless. Flooding caused by Brenda was considered to be the worst in over 25 years in some places."

By August\u00a013, the wave began to regenerate as it passed through the Lesser Antilles, producing scattered shower and thunderstorm activity. Several days later, convection associated with the system consolidated into a central, organized mass[1] and on August\u00a018, the system had become sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression.[2] Early the next day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Brenda following reports of gale-force winds from ships in the vicinity of the storm. Prior to its first landfall, Brenda suddenly intensified, with the central barometric pressure decreasing to 992\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.29\u00a0inHg)[1] and winds reached 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[2] The storm moved inland roughly 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) north of Cozumel at the northern edge of the Yucatan Peninsula on August\u00a019.[1] Roughly 24\u00a0hours after landfall, the center of Brenda passed directly over the city of M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n. By this time, a strong ridge over southern Texas and northern Mexico caused the storm to take an unusual southwest turn. Later on August\u00a020, the center of Brenda moved into the Gulf of Mexico, specifically the Bay of Campeche.[1] Once back over water, Brenda began to quickly intensify, attaining hurricane status later that day.[2] The next day, a well-defined eye had developed and the storm attained its peak intensity as a high-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.85\u00a0inHg).[1][2] Around this time, the tropical storm force winds extended out 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) to the north and 75\u00a0mi (121\u00a0km) to the south.[3] The storm made landfall later that day near Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico at this intensity, becoming the first hurricane to strike the region on record.

Along the coast, waves were recorded up to 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m).[1] Offshore, a freighter with 25 crewman became trapped in the storm after its engines failed.[5] The United States Coast Guard responded to the distress call sent out by the ship once Brenda had moved into the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a021.[6] Already suffering from severe flooding that killed at least 18 people and left 200,000 homeless, Hurricane Brenda worsened the situation with torrential rainfall and additional flooding.[1][7] Following the damage wrought by Brenda, a large earthquake struck the region, hampering relief efforts and collapsing numerous structures.[8] Winds on land gusted up to 112\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), leading to severe wind damage.[7][9] Brenda caused a total of 10\u00a0deaths.[1] Two of the fatalities occurred in Campeche after 80% of the city was flooded.[5]  Two more of these deaths occurred in the coastal city of Veracruz.[4] This was considered to be the worst flooding in the city in over 25 years.[1] According to officials, 452 homes and the local docks were destroyed in the region.[10] An estimated 2,000 people were left homeless as a direct result of Brenda throughout Mexico.[1]"

Widespread power outages were reported. In Chenzhou, which has a population of 4.6\u00a0million, it was reported that the entire city had no power or water for nearly two weeks, including government buildings and hospitals, while telecommunications cables and Internet networks were also damaged.[10] In Fuzhou, Jiangxi, it was reported that the city lost power for about 3 weeks.[1] At one point, seventeen of the thirty-one provinces and autonomous regions of China had to endure reduced power supplies. Beginning 1 February, all of Shanghai's skyline night lights were shut off to support relief efforts and were not resumed until the storm was declared officially over. In Guizhou, officials said it could take up to five months to mend the power grid fully. Xinhua reported that electricity across most of the 170 worst-hit counties was restored by the Chinese New Year.[1] Coal reserves were also down to emergency levels and stockpiles were only sufficient for eight days of power generation.[11] The snowstorm also damaged water supply equipment. For instance, in Wuhan, up to 100,000\u00a0people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. In the Guangxi region, about 239,000 were also having problems accessing drinking water.[12] Moreover, during the first week, there were significant mandatory evacuations, and an estimated 827,000\u00a0people were evacuated across fourteen provinces, affecting a total population of about 78\u00a0million. Over two weeks, according to Xinhua, 1.8\u00a0million residents were relocated elsewhere.[13][14]\nIn addition, 870,000 pigs, 450,000 sheep, and 85,000 head of cattle were killed by the storm.[8] In addition, 18,600,000 acres (75,000\u00a0km2) of forest were destroyed, including  6,800,000 acres (28,000\u00a0km2) of bamboo, 11,500,000 acres (47,000\u00a0km2) of wood, and 15,000 acres (61\u00a0km2) of saplings.[15] The freak storms were especially painful because they hit warmer parts of China that have little experience with snow.

Goods were distributed to stranded travelers, including free water bottles and lunch boxes of rice, chicken legs, and cabbages sold at about a dollar each.[18] Red banners were installed at one station encouraging some travelers to abandon their travel plans, and nearly half a million cancelled their trips after lengthy waits. Xinhua reported that 11\u00a0million migrant workers in the Guangdong area received ticket refunds. Most of the rail service resumed on 31 January, but heavy fog on 3 February caused further delays, particularly in Hunan. The lengthy delays occasionally caused clashes between travelers, police, and soldiers.[19][20][21][22]"

According to the BBC, the country's civil affairs ministry estimated that the costs to the country's economy were about 54\u00a0billion Chinese yuan but the cost rose to 80\u00a0billion yuan as of February 7.[1][30] Damage estimates as of February 13 were at about 111\u00a0billion yuan. Insurance companies across the country received tens of thousands of compensation cases including half a million from the hardest-hit regions.[15] Analysts also mentioned that extensive loss of crops (of over 40,000\u00a0km\u00b2) including fresh vegetables and fruit resulted in substantial inflation of food prices.[27] At least 11 provinces reported significant price increases after the loss of millions of crops. The price for box lunches increased fivefold across many areas in the aftermath. During the month of January, the country's producer price index hit a three-year high with a rise of 6.1%, including a nearly 30% surge in crude prices, nearly 9% in fuel, raw materials, and power prices, and a 7 to 10% increase in diesel oil, kerosene, and gasoline prices. In addition, food prices climbed by 10% to as much as 18% during the month and significantly affected the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The inflation rate itself reached 7.1%, the highest since September 1996 when it hit 7.4%.[31][32] In addition, productivity at numerous factories was affected. Among them, steel and aluminum production was scaled back due to a significant shortage of raw materials, and a loss of production of about 50,000 tonnes of lead and zinc was forecasted in Hunan. Telecom companies had significant repair costs as about 10,000\u00a0kilometers of lines were affected. The Ministry of Information Industry mentioned that this has affected 33\u00a0million users and cost at least 80\u00a0million yuan up until 27 January. Other sectors affected were hotels, airlines, and auto sales while other businesses had a disruption in the supply of products because of transportation delays. The Chinese government mentioned that the storm would not have a significant long-term effect on the general economy but would not be without significant short-term problems.[33][34] The winter weather may have been responsible for a 7% drop in the Shanghai Composite Index due to concerns about the effects of transport breakdowns and power shortages. However, the storms happened at the same time as significant worldwide stock market volatility was occurring due to concerns of a recession in the United States. Energy-related stocks rose as much as 23% due to the rise in profits because of the weather woes.[24][33]"

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao issued an apology to citizens regarding the situation in a publicly-televised appearance at a railway station in Changsha, Hunan.[35] He mentioned that the electrical system would be the first to be fixed before restoring normal train operations for Lunar New Year holiday travelers. The severe weather also led to an emergency meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, chaired by General Secretary Hu Jintao, to discuss ways in order to control the situation.[14] About 300,000 troops and 1.1\u00a0million reservists were deployed to assist relief efforts and snow removal across various parts of affected regions.[27][28] The government also announced a $700\u00a0million (2008 USD) plan for helping farmers who had their crops destroyed by the winter weather.[25] In addition, the government spent over 330\u00a0million yuan for local disaster relief operations.[9] On 1 February, Premier Wen held a State Council meeting to discuss matters related to the snowstorms, and immediately afterward flew out to Hunan to inspect relief efforts. General Secretary and President Hu visited various coal mines to urge them to help end power shortages.[36] There were also reports that China would invest significantly in better forecasting and cooperation between weather departments in the event of future storms as there were reports of criticism of the weather agencies. According to the China Meteorological Administration, there are plans to invest nearly 2\u00a0billion yuan (US$300\u00a0million) for the improvement of the weather forecasting work, which was reportedly approved by the State Council.[37] In addition, several weather experts from the meteorological office said that the country was not properly prepared to face a winter weather event of this magnitude. Some had praised northern parts of the country for their emergency plans in unusual weather. but have criticized those from the southern parts. The Chinese Meteorological Administration also added that officials were not expecting such a lengthy episode of severe winter weather with an extensive impact across a large area.[38]"

However the highway was reopened later that evening.[5][6] An evacuation warning was issued as of 6:30\u00a0p.m., that day, for Highland Home Road east to Highway 243, as well as the communities of Poppet Flats and Silent Valley.[6] Late Monday, many residents across the Inland area received an emergency alert via their cellphones telling them to \u201cevacuate now.\u201d However, the sending of that warning was in fact an error.[2] At 11:45 pm, 8 hours after the fires ignition, Cal Fire reported the fire to be 5,000 acres in size.[1] Overnight, the fire advanced toward the Silver Fire burn area of August 2013 where it would later burn itself out.[7] By Tuesday morning, the fire was estimated at 5,800 acres in size with no structures destroyed. However, the areas of Poppet Flats and Silent Valley were still under an evacuation warning.[7] As the day progressed, the fire was seemingly largely contained as there was a lack of smoke or active flame within the burn area. However the fire remained at 20% containment due to the Red Flag fire conditions that persisted, with winds blowing through the area at 40\u00a0mph.[7] Over 1,300 firefighters were on scene battling the fire by Tuesday evening.[7] On Wednesday morning, officials had updated the incident burn area to 6,309 acres in size due to better mapping overnight.[4] Containment grew from 20 percent to 77 percent as firefighters were being released from the incident, dropping the number of personnel from 1,300 to 575. The evacuation warning for the area of Highland Home Road as well as the San Jacinto Mountain communities of Poppet Flats and Silent Valley were also lifted Wednesday.[4] Cooler temperatures and a lack of wind in the fire area assisted firefighters in gaining the upper hand on the incident.[8] On Friday evening, four days after the fire broke out, the Manzanita fire was declared 100 percent contained at 6,309 acres (26\u00a0km2) in size.[1]"

Part of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season, Kompasu originated from an area of low pressure east of the Philippines on 6 October 2021. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression that day. A day later, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration  (PAGASA) classified it as a tropical depression, naming it Maring. The cyclone was initially heavily disorganised, competing with another vortex, Tropical Depression Nando. Eventually, Maring became dominant, and the JMA reclassified it as a tropical storm, naming it Kompasu. Kompasu made landfall in Cagayan, Philippines, on 11 October 2021, and two days later, the storm made landfall in Hainan, China. The cyclone dissipated on 14 October 2021 while located over Vietnam. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), 43\u00a0people died from the storm in the Philippines, with 17 missing.

That day, a reconnaissance aircraft in the system reported gale-force winds and, as a result, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm How. The storm strengthened to just below hurricane force, making landfall near Punta Gorda, Florida with 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) winds (115\u00a0km/h). While it crossed the state, the center was not very organized, and consequently the strongest winds were in the south and southeastern portion of the storm; heavy rains, however, fell across its path.[1] Tropical Storm How emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach, quickly intensifying to hurricane strength by October 3. Turning northeastward, Hurricane How reached peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) on October 4 as it passed near the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Subsequently, the hurricane embarked on a slow weakening trend, as it briefly posed a threat to New England. It passed southeast of Cape Cod before turning more to the east-northeast.

It had been sailing from Puerto Rico with a full load of iron ore and, as it approached the hurricane, the vessel changed directions and slowed. By October 5, winds were strong and the seas were moderately rough. Very quickly, the ship broke into two, which prevented any time to escape on lifeboats.[6] By the day after the wreck, rescue boats and helicopters found seven people, one of whom later died from their injuries.[7] Ultimately, 17\u00a0people died in the event.[6] Overall, Hurricane How caused about $2\u00a0million (USD) in damage. It was the only storm to strike the United States during the year, and consequently, 1951 had the least tropical cyclone damage in the United States since the 1939 season.[1]"

        "content": "Hurricane Ignacio was the latest-forming first hurricane of a Pacific hurricane season since reliable satellite observation began in 1966. The ninth tropical storm of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season, Ignacio developed out of a tropical wave on August 22 a short distance off the coast of Mexico. It was initially predicted to track out to sea and remain a weak tropical storm, though it unexpectedly organized rapidly to attain peak winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) on August 24 while located a short distance southeast of southern Baja California Sur. Land interaction weakened Ignacio to an 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) hurricane by the time it made landfall near La Paz, and it dissipated on August 27 in the central Baja California peninsula. The hurricane produced heavy rainfall across Baja California Sur, which resulted in flooding. Statewide, four people were killed, and damage was estimated at $21.2 million.[nb 1][nb 2] Resort areas near the coast experienced minor effects, though further inland the damage was more severe. The impact of Ignacio was compounded by flooding from Hurricane Marty a month later, with damage from the two hurricanes totaling about $1\u00a0billion (2003\u00a0US)."

        "content": "A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on August 6. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 16 after crossing Central America. Cloudiness and convection gradually increased along the wave axis and organized into a distinct area of disturbed weather on August 20 while located a short distance south of Manzanillo, Mexico.[1] It slowly became better organized as it moved northwestward in an area favorable for continued development.[2] With light vertical wind shear and warm water temperatures, the convection concentrated around a developing low-level circulation,[3] and on August 22 it organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Nine-E while it was located about 115 miles (185\u00a0km) west of the Mexico mainland or about 220 miles (350\u00a0km) southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.[1] With an anticyclone located over the southwestern United States and a ridge extending southward into northwestern Mexico, the National Hurricane Center initially predicted the depression to track generally west-northwestward out to sea and reach peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[3] The tropical depression moved slowly northwestward, with the slow motion persisting for its entire lifetime due to the storm being embedded within the weakness of a mid-level ridge to its north.[1] Shortly after forming, the storm was located in a marginally favorable environment, with westerly wind shear and dry air approaching the depression[4] and leaving the center of circulation exposed from the convection. However, the wind shear subsequently decreased,[5] and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ignacio.[1] The storm quickly organized and developed well-defined banding features and very well-organized upper-level outflow, and by late on August 23 a warm spot formed in the center of the convection.[6] The warm spot organized into an intermittent eye feature.[7] Early on August 24, Ignacio attained hurricane status,[1] the latest formation of the first hurricane of a season recorded in the East Pacific since reliable satellite observation began in 1966.[8] Hurricane Ignacio continued to quickly intensify after becoming a hurricane, and reached peak winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) later on August 24 while located within 30 miles (48\u00a0km)/h) off the coast of Baja California Sur.[1] Upon reaching peak strength, the hurricane possessed a 12 miles (19\u00a0km) wide eye surrounded by very deep convection. The National Hurricane Center predicted it to attain major hurricane status and potentially reach significantly higher winds if the center remained over open water.[9] However, it turned to the northwest and paralleled the Baja California Peninsula a short distance offshore, resulting in a steady weakening trend due to its interaction with the high terrain. On August 25 Ignacio made landfall just east of La Paz with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). It rapidly weakened over land, first deteriorating to a tropical storm 12\u00a0hours after landfall and later to a tropical depression about a day after moving ashore. Ignacio continued northwestward across the peninsula, and dissipated on August 28 while located in northwestern Baja California Sur.[1]"

The warning was extended on both coasts from Bahia Magdalena to San Evaristo the next day. About 48\u00a0hours before Ignacio made landfall, a hurricane warning was issued from Santa Fe to La Paz, and 21\u00a0hours later extended to Bahia Magdalena and San Evaristo. The government of Mexico also issued a tropical storm warning for the mainland from Atlata to Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa.[1] The Civil Protection agency for the state of Baja California Sur ordered for the evacuation for 10,000 residents in flood-prone areas near La Paz. Officials also moved 700\u00a0people in areas near rivers to shelters in Los Cabos.[10] 32 emergency shelters were set up in and around La Paz.[11] Residents near the coast placed sandbags to protect their houses from potential flooding,[10] and also stocked up on hurricane supplies. Police authorities were stationed in areas around Los Cabos to guard against price gouging.[12] Officials closed many schools and businesses throughout the area,[11] and also shut down the area's primary airport in La Paz.[12] About 500\u00a0people in Sinaloa were evacuated, as well.[13]"

Swells of 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) in height in La Paz closed the city's small port.[10] Hurricane-force winds blew down trees, signs, and power lines in and around La Paz,[1] while closer to the beach the hurricane destroyed multiple beach huts.[17] Rough surf in the harbor of La Paz sunk one fishing vessel and grounded four others. Efforts by the Mexican Navy prevented an additional vessel and two cruise ships from being grounded.[18] In Cabo San Lucas, effects were minimal, amounting to light winds and rain of less than 2 inches (51\u00a0mm).[19] The passage of the hurricane left citizens in Todos Santos without power for around 24\u00a0hours.[20] Heavy rainfall caused severe inland flooding,[1] destroying bridges[21] and multiple mudslides, some of which blocked roads.[11] Flash flooding in desert inland areas washed out roads, causing the Mexican government to restrict traffic through much of the peninsula for up to a week after the storm. Many roads remained impassable for a month after the hurricane.[22] The closed roads and the airport in La Paz and southern Baja California left some tourists stranded. The rainfall was welcome in some desert areas, where the moderate precipitation filled reservoirs.[23] Two rescue workers died when they were swept away by the floodwaters.[1] Six municipalities in Baja California were declared disaster areas,[24] and by four days after landfall, the Mexican government prepared emergency funds to meet the immediate needs of the affected citizens.[25] Due to the storm's slow movement, rainfall was high and the resulting flooding was severe,[1] and Ignacio was responsible for approximately US$21.2\u00a0million of damage.[26] Two rescue workers drowned in the flood waters brought by the storm and some 10,000\u00a0people were evacuated to shelters.[27] Statewide, four people were killed, 1,198 homes were damaged, 4,146\u00a0ha (10,240 acres) of crops were destroyed, and one school was also destroyed.[28] Heavy rainfall was also reported in Sinaloa on the Mexican mainland.[13] The remnants of Ignacio produced thunderstorm activity in high terrain areas of central interior California. Over 300 lightning strikes from the remnant moisture was recorded in a one-hour period. The lightning caused 14 forest fires in Merced County, resulting in a loss of power to over 3,500 customers in and around the Atwater area.[29] Just a month after Ignacio, Hurricane Marty passed through the area, causing additional damage to areas hit by Ignacio. The combined damage from the two hurricanes totaled about $1\u00a0billion (2003\u00a0USD, $1.1\u00a0billion 2006\u00a0USD), and the effects from the two storms left at least 50,000 homeless.[21]"

On July\u00a023, the storm struck southeastern Texas at its peak intensity of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). It moved inland and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Turning eastward, the storm dropped torrential rainfall in eastern Texas and western Louisiana, peaking at 21.3\u00a0in (540\u00a0mm) in Logansport, Louisiana. Several stations reported record rainfall, including Shreveport, Louisiana where its 24\u2011hour amount remained the highest daily total as of 2008.

That day, ships in the region confirmed the presence of a closed circulation. The depression was assessed to have intensified into a tropical storm at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a016, before passing just south of Jamaica later that day. After affecting the island, the storm turned to the west-southwest, reaching peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) early on July\u00a018. Later that day, a ship reported a pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg), which was adjusted to 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg) to compensate a bias in the ship's barometer. Around 1500\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018, the storm made landfall near Belize City, British Honduras, at its peak intensity.[1] After moving ashore, the storm quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Late on July\u00a019, it emerged into the Bay of Campeche.[nb 3] It turned to the northwest due to a ridge moving eastward,[3] and the system re-intensified into a tropical storm on July\u00a021. At around 0800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a023, the storm moved ashore on Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas with winds of about 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h). The storm again weakened to a tropical depression shortly after landfall, before turning to the north and north-northeast. On July\u00a024, the cyclone began interacting with a cold front, and became extratropical.[1] It tracked slowly eastward across eastern Texas and northern Louisiana due to a high pressure area to the north.[4] It later moved along the Mississippi River, and early on July\u00a027, the front absorbed the depression along the border of Arkansas and Mississippi.[1]"

Logansport also reported a 24\u2011hour total of 18\u00a0in (460\u00a0mm), which set the record for the highest daily rainfall total there in July.[8] A secondary rainfall maxima of 19.4\u00a0in (490\u00a0mm) was observed in Shreveport,[9] of which 12.4\u00a0in (310\u00a0mm) of rain fell in 24\u00a0hours; this was the highest daily total on record for the site, and remains the highest as of 2008.[10] Alexandria also broke its 24\u2011hour rainfall record in July with a total of 9.75\u00a0in (248\u00a0mm) on July\u00a025.[8] Heavy rains spread into southern Arkansas and northwestern Mississippi.[3] High rains in eastern Texas, totaling over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm), flooded roads in Shelby and Panola counties; damage in the two counties collectively totaled $1.5\u00a0million. Storm-related flooding washed out a bridge in Henderson and portions of the Santa Fe Railway line between Carthage and Longview.[4] Five people required rescue after being trapped in a fast-moving river.[11] The rains in the region were considered the heaviest in 17\u00a0years, and leaving severe damage to corn, cotton, and watermelon crops.[4] Similarly, the floods damaged cotton and other crops in northern Louisiana, totaling several million dollars in losses. The rains caused many streams to exceed their banks,[9] including one creek near Converse that flooded roads and railways.[8] The floods forced families to evacuate in low-lying areas of northern Louisiana.[11] The rainfall in Shreveport caused the worst floods related to a tropical cyclone on record.[12] While the storm was dropping heavy rainfall, it produced thunderstorms and gusty winds along the Texas and Louisiana coastlines.[9] A severe thunderstorm related to the storm damaged roofs and windows in Alexandria, Louisiana.[8]"

        "content": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Magda originated from a tropical low that was first identified by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) on 18 January 2010 near the Indonesian island of Roti. Initially situated in a weak steering environment, the low drifted towards the southwest and gradually gained intensity.[1] The following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began monitoring the system. Throughout 19 January, a developing low-level circulation showed improved organisation, feature deep convection over its centre.[2] Atmospheric conditions in the region favoured further development, featuring low to moderate wind shear. A trough situated near the coast of Western Australia aided in improving the low's outflow.[1] Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system; they expected the low to intensify into a tropical cyclone within the following 24\u00a0hours.[3] Early on 20 January, the BOM upgraded the low to a tropical cyclone, at which time it was given the name Magda. However, there is uncertainty whether the system actually obtained this strength or if it strengthened hours later. At the time of the upgrade, Magda featured deep convection over its centre, but banding features extended a little more than halfway around the circulation.[1] Later that day, the small cyclone underwent a period of rapid intensification as an eye feature became apparent in satellite imagery. In response to an approaching trough, Magda tracked towards the southeast.[1] Around 2100\u00a0UTC, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Magda, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 08S.[4] Over the following several hours, the eye feature became increasingly defined, allowing the storm to intensify into a severe tropical cyclone by 0000\u00a0UTC on 21 January. Upon reaching this strength, Magda attained ten-minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88\u00a0inHg). However, shear abruptly increased hours later, causing the low-level circulation of Magda to become displaced from the deepest convection.[1] As the storm continued to near landfall in Australia, it re-intensified as deep convection redeveloped over its centre, combined with the formation of an eye. Around 1800\u00a0UTC on 21 January, Magda was classified as a severe tropical cyclone for the second time.[1] Within hours of reattaining severe tropical cyclone status, Magda passed over Augustus Island. Around 2100\u00a0UTC, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 975 mbar (hPa; 28.79\u00a0inHg).[1] Initially, the JTWC estimated the system to have peaked as a strong tropical storm with one-minute sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph);[5] however, further analysis of the system resulted in an upgrade to a minimal Category\u00a01 equivalent with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[6] Further uncertainty in the storm's peak intensity exists through data from AMSU and CIMSS which estimated peak one-minute sustained winds of 133 and 150\u00a0km/h (83 and 93\u00a0mph) respectively.[1] Around the time when the cyclone made landfall, gale-force winds extended roughly 85\u00a0km (53\u00a0mi) from the centre of Magda, classifying it as a \"midget\" cyclone. The system made its second landfall near Kuri Bay, a remote area in the Kimberley region, at peak strength before it began to weaken.[1] Early on 22 January, the storm briefly moved back over water, having weakened slightly, before making another landfall east of the Buccaneer Archipelago with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph). Later that day, Magda passed directly over the town of Derby, where winds were measured under gale-force. This prompted the BOM to downgrade the system to a tropical low. Once the trough which initially steered Magda into Western Australia relaxed, the system slowly turned towards the south-southwest before fully dissipating early on 24 January east of Port Hedland.[1]"

A mining company, working in Mount Gibson on Koolan Island, evacuated 228 employees due to the threat of the cyclone. However, 64 members of an emergency crew would remain behind in a cyclone shelter.[7] Hours before the storm made landfall, a red alert, the highest level of storm alert, was issued for areas around where the storm was expected to move onshore. The State Emergency Service warned that all residents around Kuri Bay \"need to go to shelter immediately.\"[8] Heavy rains in excess of 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) were expected to fall along the storm's track.[9] Most of the alerts remained in place until Magda weakened to a tropical low on 22 January.[1] Although Magda made landfall as a severe tropical cyclone, it struck a sparsely populated region. Rainfall peaked at 185\u00a0mm (7.3\u00a0in) in Kuri Bay over a three-day span. Near where the storm made landfall, wind gusts were estimated up to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), resulting in significant defoliation and affecting a few structures.[1] A few homes around Kuri Bay sustained roof damage, but no injuries were reported.[10] Although damage in relation to the cyclone was limited, the name Magda was retired following its usage and was later replaced with Megan.[11]"

A colder environment transitioned Cristobal into an extratropical cyclone on August\u00a029, but it retained much of its strength as it sped across the northern Atlantic and struck Iceland on September\u00a01. Before its classification as a tropical cyclone, the disturbance that would become Cristobal dropped heavy rain over Puerto Rico, locally reaching 13.21\u00a0in (336\u00a0mm). Widespread flooding and scattered landslides affected the territory, with 19\u00a0large rivers exceeding minor flood stage. The system went on to douse the island of Hispaniola with torrential rain, leading to at least four drowning deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Floodwaters damaged or destroyed over 800\u00a0houses and temporarily isolated 23\u00a0communities in the Dominican Republic, while about 640\u00a0families were displaced in Haiti. Another person was killed by floodwaters in the Turks and Caicos. The hurricane generated strong surf and dangerous rip currents along the U.S. East Coast, killing two swimmers in Maryland and New Jersey and leading to many lifeguard rescues. Later, the extratropical remnants of Cristobal buffeted Iceland with heavy rain and gusty winds, causing flooding around the capital city of Reykjav\u00edk."

        "content": "Hurricane Cristobal originated from a westward-tracking tropical wave which emerged from the western coast of Africa on August 14, accompanied for several days by an expanse of clouds. Some cyclonic turning was evident as the disturbance approached the Leeward Islands by August 21, but a Hurricane Hunters flight tasked with investigating the system did not reveal a strong circulation at the surface. The system failed to consolidate as it traversed Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, but on August 23, further reconnaissance data confirmed the formation of a tropical depression just south of the Caicos Islands. The nascent cyclone slowly moved north-northwestward toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Moderate wind shear in the area kept convection over the depression disorganized and outflow limited, and the storm only gradually intensified.[1][2] The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Cristobal at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a024, while located just north of Mayaguana in the Bahamas,[1] but its structure was vertically tilted and suboptimally broad.[3][4] Weak steering currents kept Cristobal's forward motion slow and erratic,[5] and the storm remained heavily affected by shear, with most deep convection displaced from the center.[6] On August\u00a025, the system turned toward the north-northeast in response to a mid-level trough to the north.[1] Despite a ragged cloud pattern characterized by an exposed low-level center and a distinct lack of banding features, Cristobal intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026, as indicated by aircraft observations.[1][7] The newly upgraded hurricane headed along a general northward path, and for the next couple days, pockets of dry air kept prevented further intensification.[1] Convection fluctuated in intensity and coverage, and early on August\u00a027 the National Hurricane Center remarked that \"the satellite presentation resembles a subtropical cyclone\".[8][9] However, later that same day, the hurricane showed signs of increased development while located midway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.[10][11] In particular, its cloud pattern became much more symmetric, and some cloud tops cooled to \u201370\u00a0\u00b0C (\u201395\u00a0\u00b0F).[11] Around the same time, Cristobal accelerated toward the northeast as it became embedded within the mid-latitude westerlies ahead of an advancing shortwave trough.[1] An area of relatively warm cloud tops at the center of a central dense overcast gave way to an eye feature evident on visible satellite imagery on August\u00a028.[12][13] Rapidly gaining latitude, Cristobal reached its peak intensity at 18:00\u00a0UTC, with winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), roughly 490\u00a0mi (790\u00a0km) due south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.[1] Shortly thereafter, the hurricane began to degrade as it moved over significantly colder waters and began to encounter further dry air, signalling the beginning of its transition to an extratropical cyclone.[14] Cristobal's circulation soon began to interact with a frontal boundary, and deep convection became distanced well to the north of the center.[15] Consequently, the hurricane lost its tropical identity by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, just north of 44\u00b0N.[1] Baroclinic processes preserved much of the extratropical cyclone's intensity,[14] allowing it to maintain hurricane-force winds until August\u00a030. Speeding generally northeastward, the storm slowly weakened over the northern Atlantic, making landfall on Iceland on September 1. Cristobal merged with another storm system north of the country by the next day.[1]"

A rain gauge near Tibes recorded a peak total of 13.21\u00a0in (336\u00a0mm), the majority of which fell on August 24. Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport near San Juan reported 5.52\u00a0in (140\u00a0mm) of precipitation. In total, 19 rivers reached minor flood stage and five reached moderate flood stage;[16] some of them inundated adjacent roadways and urban areas.[17] The heavy rainfall triggered multiple landslides, at least one of which forced a family to evacuate.[18] The floods cut electricity to nearly 17,000\u00a0customers and left 7,000\u00a0without clean drinking water after putting some 18\u00a0filtration plants out of service.[18] In some cases, however, the rain proved beneficial, refilling reservoirs after an abnormally dry summer.[19] Only the northwestern corner of Puerto Rico escaped hydrological issues. Gusty winds caused minor damage to trees and tree branches in the territory. Moderate to heavy rainfall also affected the U.S. Virgin Islands, amounting to 5.27\u00a0in (134\u00a0mm) on Saint Thomas and 2.22\u00a0in (56\u00a0mm) on Saint Croix.[16] The island of Hispaniola also received damaging rainfall from the slow-moving storm.[1] La Romana, Dominican Republic, recorded 5.04\u00a0in (128\u00a0mm) of rain in 24 hours on August\u00a023 and\u00a024, the result being destructive flooding.[20] The floods isolated 23\u00a0towns from the outside world and damaged or destroyed more than 800\u00a0dwellings, especially in eastern and northeastern parts of the nation. Just over 4,100\u00a0individuals were forced to evacuate their homes.[21] In Santo Domingo Province, three people required rescue from their car after trying to cross the swollen Isabela River.[22] Two people were killed in the Dominican Republic,[1] one of them after attempting to drive across a flooded river in the Hato Mayor Province.[23] In neighboring Haiti, flooding totally destroyed four homes and heavily damaged 28\u00a0others, with a total of about 640\u00a0families left temporarily homeless.[24] At least two people in the country were swept away by rushing waters,[20][25] and many others sustained injuries.[26] Shortly after the storm's genesis, tropical storm warnings were issued for the central and southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The advisories were discontinued by August 25. Heavy rain fell over the region, reaching 10.9\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm) on the island of Providenciales, where one person drowned in the ensuing floods.[1] Floodwaters on North Caicos ran 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) deep, blocking access to some communities.[27] Governor Peter Beckingham reported \"extensive damage to peoples' property and possessions\" throughout the overseas territory.[26]"

The fire department there responded to 37\u00a0calls for flooded buildings.[38] Reykjav\u00edk Airport and Keflav\u00edk International Airport recorded wind gusts to 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) and 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h), respectively.[39][40] The adverse conditions impeded aerial surveillance of the ongoing volcanic eruptions at B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga.[41]"

The depression displayed convective banding features, wrapping into a disorganized low-level center of circulation.

This made Dujuan the first named storm within the PAR in 2021.[3] Three hours later, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, giving it the designation 01W.[4] As the system tracked to the west-northwest, it continued to strengthen until the early hours of February 18, when it was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JMA, JTWC, and the PAGASA,[4][5][6] with the JMA giving it the name Dujuan.[1] At 03:00 UTC on February 19, the PAGASA briefly upgraded Dujuan into a severe tropical storm, before downgrading it back.[7][8] The next day, vertical wind shear in Dujuan's environment had decreased, allowing the storm to slightly re-strengthen.[9] The vertical wind shear associated with the northeast monsoon still persisted, affecting the system,[10] and on February 21, the JMA downgraded Dujuan to a tropical depression.[1] The JTWC and the PAGASA followed on the next day as the system's low-level circulation center (LLCC) had weakened prior to landfall.[4][11] The JMA and the JTWC issued their final advisories moments after.[12][13] The storm made landfall over Batag Island in Laoang, Northern Samar at 09:00 PHT (01:00 UTC) on the same day.[14] Prior to crossing the Rapu-Rapu Islands in Albay, the PAGASA declared the storm as a low-pressure area and issued their final bulletin on the storm.[15] Dujuan dissipated on February 23 at 06:00 UTC.[1]"

The fifth named storm and second hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Earl originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 25. The wave struggled to develop over the next week as it moved west-northwestward in a marginally conducive environment. Eventually, the system was able to organize into Tropical Storm Earl on September 3. The storm passed through parts of the Caribbean, but strong wind shear initially halted Earl from intensifying and it maintained tropical storm status. The storm then turned northward into a more favorable environment and started to intensify. Earl eventually reached Category 2 hurricane status, before repeated dry air entrainments caused the storm to fluctuate in intensity.[1] Earl reached peak winds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h) before quickly becoming extratropical off the coast of Newfoundland on September 10. It continued moving northeast before dissipating on September 15. Four fatalities were related to Hurricane Earl: two from lightning in Puerto Rico and two from rip currents in New Jersey.

By this time, Earl had become a rather large hurricane, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 80 miles (130\u00a0km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 275 miles (443\u00a0km).[12] After maintaining this intensity for several hours, Earl weakened down to a Category 1 hurricane again at 15:00 UTC on September 10, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone due south of Cape Race, Newfoundland six hours later.[13] Earl continued to move northeast after becoming extratropical and moved north of the Azores, approaching Europe. Earl continued to spiral north before dissipating on September 15 after \"losing its identity\" north of the Azores.[14][15]"

The seventeenth named storm, eleventh hurricane, and eighth major hurricane of the season, Linda developed southwest of Mexico from a low-pressure area on September\u00a05. Under warm sea surface temperatures and low to moderate wind shear, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Linda by September\u00a06 and a hurricane by the next day. A well-defined eye soon formed within the storm's central dense overcast and Linda reached its peak intensity as a 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a03 major hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale on September\u00a08. Thereafter, the storm moved into a stable environment and an area of lower sea surface temperatures, causing rapid weakening. Convective activity dissipated and Linda degenerated into a remnant low on September\u00a010. The lingering system persisted southwest of Baja California, ultimately opening up into a trough on September\u00a014. In Mexico, the storm brought rainfall to nine states, causing flooding, especially in Oaxaca, Sinaloa, and Zacatecas. In Oaxaca, mudslides resulted in the closure of multiple highways and damage to over a dozen homes. Flooding in Sinola affected approximately 1,000\u00a0homes with hundreds damaged, prompting dozens of families to evacuate. Several small communities were temporarily isolated after flood waters covered bridges. Localized flooding in Zacatecas damaged crops and 25\u00a0dwellings; damage reached approximately 500,000\u00a0pesos (US$30,000). Although Linda did not directly impact land, moisture from the storm was pulled northeast into the Southwestern United States and enhanced the local monsoon. Los Angeles received 2.39\u00a0in (61\u00a0mm) of rain, contributing to the city's second wettest September on record. One fatality in the state occurred from a drowning at San Bernardino National Forest. Utah was impacted by major flash flooding incidents\u2014with rainfall amounting to 1-in-100 year levels\u2014which left 21\u00a0deaths in the state: 14 near Hildale and 7 in Zion National Park.

Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the wave began to increase over the next few days as it crossed the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Convection was enhanced further on September\u00a02 as a Kelvin wave interacted with the tropical wave, eventually resulting in the development of a broad low-pressure area.[1] Early the following day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) for a cluster of convection that showed signs of organizing into a tropical system. Wind shear was forecast to become more conducive for tropical cyclogenesis over the next few days.[3] Although the shear remained moderately strong, the low acquired a well-defined center of circulation by September\u00a04. Following further organization of deep convection, Tropical Depression Fifteen-E developed at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05 while located about 490\u00a0mi (790\u00a0km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.[1] Under the influence of a strong mid-level ridge over northern Mexico, the depression moved northwestward into an area of moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. By 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Linda. Due to a decrease in wind shear, Linda began to undergo rapid deepening shortly thereafter. Between that day and early on September\u00a07, the storm increased in convective banding and developed central dense overcast; satellite imagery also indicated that an eye was forming around that time. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, Linda intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Just six hours later, the cyclone reached Category\u00a02 status. Due to a slight increase in wind shear and possibly an intrusion from dry air, Linda temporarily remained steady in intensity while passing between Socorro Island and Clarion Island.[1] Operationally, the NHC briefly downgraded Linda to a Category 1 hurricane at 0:300\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08,[4] though post-analysis concluded that the storm remained a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[1] Strengthening resumed by early on September\u00a08, when the system became a Category\u00a03 hurricane, which coincided with satellite imagery indicating a banded eye feature. Around 12:00\u00a0UTC, Linda attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg). Early on September\u00a09, the hurricane rapidly weakened after entering a region of slightly colder sea surface temperatures, falling to Category\u00a02 by 06:00\u00a0UTC and to Category\u00a01 intensity only six hours later. Around that time, Linda began encountering a dry, stable air mass and ocean temperature under 26.0\u00a0\u00b0C (78.8\u00a0\u00b0F). At 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm while also losing convective coverage. After the remaining showers and thunderstorms detached from the low-level circulation, Linda transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone around 12:00\u00a0UTC the following day while situated about 260\u00a0mi (415\u00a0km) west-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Baja California Sur. The remnants weakened over the next few days, until degenerating into a trough while still well west of Baja California on September\u00a014.[1]"

Act quickly to protect your life\".[25] The first storm resulted in a 3.42\u00a0ft (1.04\u00a0m) rise along the Short Creek, as measured by a stream gauge in Colorado City, Arizona, in 19\u00a0minutes around 21:18\u00a0UTC (3:18\u00a0p.m. MDT),[24][25] with residents gathering nearby to observe.[25] Between 22:48 and 23:05\u00a0UTC (4:48 and 5:05\u00a0p.m. MDT), a second surge of water swept down the creek with the Colorado City gauge reporting a rise of 5.36\u00a0ft (1.63\u00a0m);[24] the gauge stopped reporting at 23:47\u00a0UTC (5:47\u00a0p.m. MDT). The second flood swept away two vehicles carrying a collective 16\u00a0people while they were observing the rising waters.[25] Thirteen people were killed and three children were rescued.[26] Six bodies were recovered in Utah and two in Arizona, 2.5\u00a0mi (4.0\u00a0km) downstream.[24] Other bodies were found up to 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) downstream.[27] Alongside the fatalities, the floods left several blocks of the town without power.[29] Water lines, bridges, and other infrastructure sustained varying degrees of damage. Several homes sustained water and mud damage. Total losses in Washington County reached $750,000.[30] Flooding continued downstream into Arizona, rendering multiple roads impassible and damaging bridges around Colorado City; losses in the city amounted to $500,000.[31] Around 150\u00a0federal personnel and 500\u00a0community volunteers, including 70\u201380\u00a0percent of Hildale's residents, conducted search and rescue in the immediate aftermath.[24][32] Twenty-four members of Utah Task Force One and twenty-six personnel from the Utah National Guard were dispatched to Hildale to assist in search and rescue along Short Creek. Dangerous conditions along the creek slowed the operation.[33] By September\u00a017, 300\u00a0personnel were searching for a 6-year-old boy who was still missing.[34] Ultimately, thousands of people from more than 60\u00a0agencies took part in the search for the final victim; efforts were called off by September\u00a029 and the missing boy was presumed dead.[23] Local residents continued periodic searches for the boy through December.[32] The Utah Department of Public Safety granted the Public Safety Award to Washington County Sheriff Cory Pulsipher, Hildale Mayor Philip Barlow and, Hildale Marshall's Office Chief Jeremiah Darger for their response coordination.[35] Following the floods, the Washington County allocated $1.6\u00a0million through the Natural Resources Conservation Service for repair costs and mitigation efforts for future floods. Of this total, $1.5\u00a0million went to Hildale.[27] The United States Department of Agriculture also provided $100,000 through the Emergency Watershed Protection program.[36] The second flash flood incident occurred in Keyhole Canyon at Zion National Park after 0.63\u00a0in (16\u00a0mm) of rain fell between 22:30 and 23:30\u00a0UTC (4:30 and 5:30\u00a0p.m. MDT).[37] For the two-day period ending September\u00a014, the park saw 1.89\u00a0in (48\u00a0mm) of rain.[24] The earlier flash flood warning prompted officials at the park to close all canyons by 21:30\u00a0UTC (3:30\u00a0p.m. MDT). A group of seven canyoneers entered Keyhole Canyon between 21:30 and 22:30\u00a0UTC (3:30 and 4:30\u00a0p.m. MDT).[38] Flow along the Virgin River dramatically increased following the rains, with the river's North Fork experiencing a rise from 55\u00a0ft3 (1.5\u00a0m3) per second to 2,630\u00a0ft3 (74.5\u00a0m3) per second in just 15\u00a0minutes.[39] All seven people were swept away by the ensuing flood and died.[34] Rescue operations were launched that evening; however, dangerous conditions in the canyons resulted in the search being held off until the following day. The bodies of the canyoneers were discovered miles apart along Clear Creek and Pine Creek.[38] Elsewhere, a man from Hurricane, Utah, 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) west of Hildale, died on September\u00a014 after being swept away by floods while traveling remote dirt roads.[40] His vehicle was discovered in Mohave County, Arizona on September\u00a017 about 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) south of the Arizona\u2013Utah border and his body was found a further 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) away the following day.[22] In Utah County, Utah, the rain resulted in traffic accidents and mudslides, including several at American Fork Canyon that shut down parts of State Route 92 and State Route 144.[41] Scattered thunderstorms caused sporadic damage across Arizona, leaving $206,000 in losses.[42]"

Iris was the second-strongest storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, behind Hurricane Michelle.[1] It was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane[nb 1] of the year, forming from a tropical wave on October\u00a04 just southeast of Barbados. It moved westward through the Caribbean, intensifying into a tropical storm on October\u00a05 south of Puerto Rico, and into a hurricane on the following day. While passing south of the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides, killing eight people. Later, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica, where it destroyed two houses. On reaching the western Caribbean Sea, Iris rapidly intensified into a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. A small hurricane with an eye of only 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) in diameter, Iris reached peak winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) before making landfall in southern Belize near Monkey River Town on October\u00a09. The hurricane quickly dissipated over Central America, although its remnants contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Manuel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The hurricane caused severe damage\u2014destroying homes, flooding streets, and leveling trees\u2014in coastal towns south of Belize City. Destruction was heaviest in Belize and totaled $250\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD).[nb 2] Because Iris was compact, the damage was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718\u00a0homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35\u00a0villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000\u00a0people homeless, many receiving assistance from the government and the local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24\u00a0people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500\u00a0homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died."

        "content": "Toward the end of September 2001, a poorly-defined tropical wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, through an area of hostile wind shear, which was caused by a large upper-level low within a trough, to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles.[3] A few days later, the upper-level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the Caribbean Sea, allowing for an upper-level ridge, or high-pressure area, to form over the tropical wave. The change provided a favorable environment for tropical development, and an area of convection soon blossomed along the wave's axis. As the tropical wave approached the Lesser Antilles, a mid-level wind circulation formed within the deepest part of the convection, and a low-level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery. Although its low-level circulation was small and poorly defined, the system increased in organization enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Eleven at 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, located about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) southeast of Barbados.[3] Operationally, however, Hurricane Hunters did not confirm the depression's formation until nine hours later.[4] In its early stages, the depression moved west-northwestward between the islands of St. Vincent and St. Lucia under the influence of a strong ridge to its north. Compared to its appearance 24\u00a0hours before forming, the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection, although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized.[4] This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression's well-organized appearance on satellite imagery.[5] At 21:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h), corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). Based on these data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Iris, situated about 155\u00a0mi (249\u00a0km) south of the southern coast of Puerto Rico.[6] In post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that Iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.[3] Despite the storm's intensification and well-organized satellite appearance, the circulation failed to become better defined.[3] In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned the potential for the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed.[4] One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south.[6] Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on October\u00a06.[7] Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the Dominican Republic,[3] and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was the only factor impeding further development.[8] After Iris reached winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) early on October\u00a07, its intensity remained steady for about 24\u00a0hours.[3] During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an upper-level low.[9] By late on October\u00a07, the area of hurricane\u00a0force winds associated with Iris extended only 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) from its 16\u00a0mi (26\u00a0km) wide eye.[10][11] Early on October\u00a08, after turning west-southwestward away from the Greater Antilles, Iris began strengthening again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear and the NHC predicted peak winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) before the storm would hit Belize.[12] However, Iris instead began to rapidly intensify within the favorable conditions, going from 95 to 140\u00a0mph (153 to 225\u00a0km/h) in a 12-hour period on October\u00a08, making Iris a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; in the same duration, the minimum central pressure dropped 38\u00a0mbar (1.12\u00a0inHg).[3] While intensifying, the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls, with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km).[13] For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km), during Hurricane Wilma in 2005.[14] With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde into the center of Iris,[13] and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle, but within a few hours Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) just off Belize. At 02:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a09, it made landfall at peak intensity in Monkey River Town in the southern portion of Belize.[3] Operationally, it was assessed as having made landfall with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), though for an unknown reason this was lowered in post-analysis. Initially, Hurricane Iris was forecast to remain a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America and to re-intensify in the eastern Pacific Ocean; had it done so, it would have retained the name Iris.[13] Instead, the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of Guatemala, and within six hours of landfall, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Late on October\u00a09, within sixteen hours of landfall, the storm's circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico.[3] As the remnants approached the Pacific Ocean, a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of Iris. It gradually organized while continuing westward, developing into Tropical Storm Manuel; the new storm ultimately lasted until October\u00a018, before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.[15]"

Shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused.[16] In Belize, a hurricane warning was issued about 23\u00a0hours before Iris moved ashore.[3] A state of national emergency was declared on October\u00a08 as Hurricane Iris neared landfall.

The captain had delayed returning to shore, and the passengers waited for the storm to pass along a dock, not anticipating the ferocity.[27] Iris cut the ropes connecting the boat to the dock, causing it to overturn in 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) waters.[26][27] Eight people survived, and 11\u00a0bodies were recovered; it was presumed that 20\u00a0people died during the wreck,[3] including 15 from the Richmond area and three crew members.[26] Another boat, the Vendera, also reportedly capsized with people on board.[3]"

        "content": "Hurricane Iris moved ashore in Belize with winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), although the highest measured winds were 106\u00a0mph (171\u00a0km/h) at a station in Big Creek. Because of its small diameter, Iris produced heavy damage only in a 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) area of southern Belize. In that region, the hurricane produced a storm surge of up to 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m),[3] with waves of over 13\u00a0ft (4.0\u00a0m) in height,[21] causing street flooding and some damage to the offshore cayes.[28] As it moved ashore, Iris damaged houses and schools in dozens of villages.[29] In 35\u00a0villages, the storm destroyed more than 95% of the buildings.[30] Its small size confined the worst damage largely to Toledo and Stann Creek districts, which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country.[21][31] The percentage of damaged houses was 72% in Toledo district and about 50% in Stann Creek,[32] leaving about 15,000\u00a0people homeless.[33] In both districts, the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies.[30] In the worst-affected areas, poor Mayan people living on farms lost much of what they owned.[30] At Placencia near the coast, about 80% of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage, with downed power poles in the streets.[21] About 90% of the houses in nearby Seine Bight were destroyed,[34] and where Iris made landfall, over 90% of the homes were destroyed throughout Monkey River Town.[21] The storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern Belize. Iris also damaged tourism facilities, including minor impact to the Maya ruins of Belize,[35] and damaged 20% of the hotel rooms in the country, accounting for $37\u00a0million in losses.[36] The remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.[37] In southern Belize, the storm's strong winds left crop damage, in some cases where the harvest had just begun. About 5,000 acres (2,000\u00a0ha) of bananas were destroyed, along with over 3,500 acres (1,400\u00a0ha) of rice, 3,000 acres (1,200\u00a0ha) of corn, and other crops to a lesser degree.[35] The storm also flooded fields and killed several livestock. The shrimp industry lost 25% of its catch,[35] partly due to contaminated waters.[38] Crop damage in Belize was estimated at $103\u00a0million,[36] mostly from banana losses.[35] Iris's strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest, with upwards of 40% of trees affected in some areas.[35] This disrupted the habitats of several animals, and it is likely that many of the howler monkeys near Monkey River were killed.[39] The storm's strong waves eroded the beach, although marine effects were much less than those of Hurricane Keith in the previous year.[35] Nevertheless, there were reports of fish die-offs after the storm, possibly from low oxygen due to too much decaying matter.[39] Nationwide, Iris damaged or destroyed 3,718\u00a0homes,[40] directly affecting a total of 21,568\u00a0people,[31] or 8.5% of the total population.[41] The storm damaged or destroyed 31\u00a0schools and 17\u00a0health facilities,[31] along with 21\u00a0government buildings.[42] There was about $25\u00a0million in damage to the transportation sector, including highways and bridges.[36] Iris killed 24\u00a0people in and around the country,[43] including the victims of the Wave Dancer shipwreck.[44] Overall damage was estimated at $250\u00a0million,[45] making it the most damaging storm in the country since Hurricane Hattie in 1961.[37]"

By the day after the storm struck, the airport in Belize City had been reopened, and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal.[34] Residents in the southern part of the country lost access to fresh water, forcing them to drink unclean water.[30] Officials sent medical teams to southern Belize in the most affected areas.[21] The Belmopan Red Cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money, clothing, and food for storm victims.[34] The Red Cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7,000\u00a0people.[44] By October\u00a019, most roads in southern Belize were reopened. The Belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs, and officials authorized spending $1.2\u00a0million to rebuild damaged homes. To assist the farmers who lost crops, the Belize government provided 18,000\u00a0lb (8,200\u00a0kg) of maize seeds, as well as fertilizer.[32] After the storm, the World Food Programme and the Belize Red Cross collectively provided food for the 9,000\u00a0families in need of subsidence.[54] By October\u00a031, the Red Cross had provided blankets, tarps, and hygienic supplies to 4,800\u00a0people severely affected by the storm.[55] Homes were gradually repaired, and crop production returned to normal by early 2002. Around Christmas of 2001, the Belize Red Cross provided presents to school children in 14\u00a0villages affected by the storm.[40] The lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22% in 2002, although sales gradually recovered.[56] The government of Belize issued an appeal to the international community for assistance in the days following Iris's landfall,[57] and various countries provided aid.[34] The United Kingdom sent a helicopter to assist in damage assessment and a crew to clean the water. The United States also sent a crew for damage assessment and donated plastic sheeting.[58] Although sustaining significant damage, the Government of Guatemala deployed a working team with members from throughout the country to assist in recovery in Belize.[59] Mexico sent blankets, mattresses, food, and water, as well as a medical team.[58] The Japanese government sent tents and blankets,[60] and the Chinese government donated 500\u00a0lb (230\u00a0kg) of rice and dried fruits.[58] Various United Nations departments donated about $225,000.[34] The American victims of the Wave Dancer boat wreck were flown back to the Richmond, Virginia area following the storm.[26] The insurance company covering the boat reached a $4\u00a0million settlement, which was disbursed among the survivors and the victims' families. The boat operator remained in business following the accident.[27]"

        "content": " Other wikis Hurricane Floyd was a very powerful Cape Verde hurricane which struck the Bahamas and the East Coast of the United States. It was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Floyd triggered the fourth largest evacuation in US history (behind Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Gustav, and Hurricane Rita) when 2.6\u00a0million coastal residents of five states were ordered from their homes as it approached. The hurricane formed off the coast of Africa and lasted from September 7 to 19, becoming extratropical after September 17, and peaked in strength as a very strong Category\u00a04 hurricane. It was among the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its strength ever recorded, in terms of gale-force diameter.[1] Floyd was once forecast to strike Florida, but turned away. Instead, Floyd struck the Bahamas at peak strength, causing heavy damage. It then moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States, causing massive evacuations and costly preparations from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm weakened significantly, however, before striking the Cape Fear region, North Carolina as a very strong Category\u00a02 hurricane, and caused further damage as it traveled up the Mid-Atlantic region and into New England. The hurricane produced torrential rainfall in Eastern North Carolina, adding more rain to an area already hit by Hurricane Dennis just weeks earlier. The rains caused widespread flooding over a period of several weeks; nearly every river basin in the eastern part of the state exceeded 500-year flood levels. In total, Floyd was responsible for 85 fatalities and $6.5\u00a0billion (1999\u00a0USD) in damage. Due to the destruction, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Floyd and replaced it with Franklin."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Floyd originated from a tropical wave that exited the west coast of Africa on September 2. The wave moved generally westward, presenting a general curvature in its convection, or thunderstorms, but little organization at first. By September 5, a center of circulation was evident within the convective system. Over the next day, the thunderstorms increased in intensity as they organized into a curved band. Aided by favorable outflow, the system organized further into Tropical Depression Eight late on September 7, located about 1,000\u00a0mi (1,600\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles. With a strong ridge of high pressure to its north, the nascent tropical depression moved to the west-northwest, where environmental conditions favored continued strengthening,[2] including progressively warmer water temperatures.[3] On issuing its first advisory, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) anticipated that the depression would intensify into a hurricane within three days,[4] a forecast that proved accurate.[2] On its second advisory, NHC forecaster Lixion Avila stated that the depression had \"all the ingredients...that we know of...to become a major hurricane eventually.\"[3] Early on September 8, the depression became sufficiently well-organized for the NHC to upgrade it to Tropical Storm Floyd.[2] The storm had a large circulation,[5] but Floyd initially lacked a well-defined inner core, which resulted in only slow strengthening.[2] The first Hurricane Hunters mission occurred on September 9, which observed the developing storm.[6] On September 10, Floyd intensified into a hurricane about 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles. Around that time, the track shifted more to the northwest, steered by a tropical upper tropospheric trough north of Puerto Rico.[2] An eye developed in the center of the hurricane, signaling strengthening.[7] On September 11, Hurricane Floyd moved through the upper-level trough, which, in conjunction with an anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean, disrupted the outflow and caused the winds to weaken briefly. The hurricane re-intensified on September 12 as its track shifted more to the west, steered by a ridge to the north. That day, the NHC upgraded Floyd to a major hurricane, or a Category\u00a03 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.[2] Over a 24-hour period from September\u00a012\u201313, Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified, aided by warm waters east of The Bahamas. During that time, the maximum sustained winds increased from 110 to 155\u00a0mph (177 to 249\u00a0km/h),[nb 1] making Floyd a strong Category 4 hurricane. This was based a 90% reduction of an observation by the Hurricane Hunters, which recorded flight-level winds of 171\u00a0mph (276\u00a0km/h). Around the same time, the pressure dropped to 921\u00a0mb (921\u00a0hPa; 27.2\u00a0inHg),[2] which was the fourth-lowest pressure for a hurricane not to reach Category\u00a05 intensity in the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 only Hurricanes Iota, Gloria and Opal had lower pressures than Floyd.[8] Around this time, tropical cyclone forecast models suggested an eventual landfall in the Southeastern United States from Palm Beach, Florida to South Carolina.[9] At its peak, tropical storm-force winds spanned a diameter of 580\u00a0mi (930\u00a0km), making Floyd one of the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its intensity ever recorded.[1] For about 12\u00a0hours, Hurricane Floyd remained just below Category\u00a05 status while crossing The Bahamas. Late on September 13, the eye of the hurricane passed just north of San Salvador and Cat Islands. On the next day, the hurricane made landfalls on Eleuthera and Abaco islands.[2] During this time, Floyd underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, in which an outer eyewall developed, causing the original eye to dissipate near Eleuthera. This caused a temporary drop in sustained winds to Category\u00a03 status, only for Floyd to restrengthen briefly to a Category\u00a04 on September 15.[2] While approaching the southeastern United States, a strong mid- to upper-level trough eroded the western portion of the high-pressure ridge, which had been steering Floyd for several days. The break in the ridge caused Floyd to turn to the northwest. After the hurricane completed its eyewall replacement cycle, Floyd had a large 57\u00a0mi (93\u00a0km) eye. The large storm gradually weakened after exiting The Bahamas, due to drier air and increasing wind shear. On September 15, Floyd paralleled the east coast of Florida about 110\u00a0mi (170\u00a0km) offshore, as it accelerated to the north and north-northeast. At around 06:30\u00a0UTC on September 16, Hurricane Floyd made landfall in Cape Fear, North Carolina with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h), a Category\u00a02. The eyewall had largely dissipated by that time. Continuing northeastward along a cold front, Floyd moved through eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, weakening to tropical storm status by late on September 16. The storm gradually lost its tropical characteristics as it quickly moved through the Delmarva Peninsula, eastern New Jersey, Long Island, and New England. Late on September 17, Floyd transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near the coast of southern Maine. The storm continued to the northeast, passing through New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland on September 18. On the following day, a larger extratropical storm over the North Atlantic Ocean absorbed what was once Hurricane Floyd.[2]"

        "content": "Early in Floyd's duration, the hurricane posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, prompting tropical storm watches for Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Saint Martin, and Saint Barthelemy. After the storm bypassed the region, the government of The Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas, as well as hurricane warnings for the central and northwestern Bahamas.[2] Although Floyd's track prediction was above average while out at sea, the forecasts as it approached the coastline were merely average compared to forecasts from the previous ten years. The official forecasts did not predict Floyd's northward track nor its significant weakening before landfall.[10] At some point, the NHC issued a hurricane warning for nearly all of the East Coast of the United States, from Florida City, Florida, to Plymouth, Massachusetts; however, only a fraction of this area actually received hurricane-force winds. The last time such widespread hurricane warnings occurred was during Hurricane Donna in 1960.[2] Initial fears were of a direct hit as a large Category\u00a04 hurricane in Florida, potentially costlier and deadlier than Hurricane Andrew had been in 1992. In preparation for a potentially catastrophic landfall, more than one million Florida residents were told to evacuate, of which 272,000 were in Miami-Dade County.[11] U.S. President Bill Clinton declared a federal state of emergency in both Florida and Georgia in anticipation of the storm's approach.[12] As the storm turned to the north, more people were evacuated as a progressively larger area was threatened. The massive storm prompted what was then the largest peacetime evacuation in U.S. history, with around 2.6\u00a0million evacuating coastal areas in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.[13] With the storm predicted to hit near Cape Canaveral with winds of over 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h), all but 80 of Kennedy Space Center's 12,500-person workforce were evacuated. The hangars that house three space shuttles can withstand winds of only 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h), and a direct hit could have resulted in potentially billions of dollars in damage of space equipment.[14] In the theoretical scenario, the damage would be caused by water, always a potential problem in an area only nine feet above sea level. If water entered the facility, it would damage the electronics as well as requiring a complete inspection of all hardware.[15] When Floyd actually passed by the area, Kennedy Space Center only reported light winds with minor water intrusion. Damage was minor overall, and was repaired easily.[16] A hurricane warning was issued for the North Carolina coastline 27\u00a0hours prior to landfall. However, due to the size of the storm, initial forecasts predicted nearly all of the state would be affected in one form or another. School systems and businesses as far west as Asheville shut down for the day landfall was predicted. As it turned out, only the Coastal Plain sustained significant damage; much of the state west of Raleigh escaped unscathed. In New York City, public schools were closed on September 16, 1999, the day Floyd hit the area. This was a rare decision by the city, as New York City public schools close on average once every few years. Before Floyd, the last time New York City closed its schools was for the Blizzard of 1996. After Floyd, the next time its public schools would close was due to a blizzard on March 5, 2001.[17] Walt Disney World also closed for the first time in its history due to the storm. The resort would later close during hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004, Matthew in 2016, Irma in 2017, Dorian in 2019, and Ian in 2022.[18][19] A state of emergency was declared in Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey prompting schools statewide to be shut down on September 16. In Delaware, about 300\u00a0people evacuated.[20][21][22] In Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued 14\u00a0warnings related to Floyd, generating significant media interest. About 100 Sable Offshore Energy Project employees were evacuated to the mainland. In southwestern Nova Scotia, 66\u00a0schools were closed, and provincial ferry service with Bar Harbor, Maine was canceled.[23]"

Damage was greatest at Abaco Island, Cat Island, San Salvador Island, and Eleuthera Island, where Floyd uprooted trees and destroyed a significant number of houses.[27] Numerous restaurants, hotels, shops, and homes were devastated, severely limiting in the recovery period tourism on which many rely for economic well-being.[28] Damaged water systems left tens of thousands across the archipelago without water, electricity, or food. Despite the damage, however, few deaths were reported, as only one person drowned in Freeport, and there were few injuries reported.[26]"

        "content": "For several days, Hurricane Floyd paralleled the east coast of Florida, spurring widespread evacuations. Ultimately, the storm left $50\u00a0million in damage, mostly in Volusia county. There, high winds and falling trees damaged 337\u00a0homes. The highest recorded wind gust in the state was 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) in Daytona Beach. Beach erosion affected much of the state's Atlantic coast. The most significant effects were in Brevard and Volusia counties, where waves damaged houses and piers. Rainfall in the state reached 3.2\u00a0in (81\u00a0mm) in Sanford.[2][29][30] Farther north in Georgia, Floyd produced wind gusts of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) at Savannah International Airport. The winds knocked down a few trees and power lines near the coast, but statewide damage was minimal. In Savannah, the hurricane produced tides 3.3\u00a0ft (1.0\u00a0m) above normal. Rainfall was light in the state, reaching 0.85\u00a0in (22\u00a0mm) in Newington.[31][2] Tropical storm force winds affected the entirety of the South Carolina coastline, with statewide damage estimated at $17\u00a0million. Sustained winds reached 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) at the Charleston National Weather Service Office, which also recorded wind gusts of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). The winds destroyed a few roofs and knocked down thousands of trees, leaving more than 200,000\u00a0people without electricity. The hurricane produced above normal tides along the coast, reaching 10.1\u00a0ft (3.1\u00a0m) above normal in Charleston Harbor. The waves caused minor to moderate beach erosion. At Myrtle Beach International Airport, Hurricane Floyd dropped 16.06\u00a0in (408\u00a0mm) of rainfall, the highest recorded in the state.[32][2]"

        "content": "North Carolina received the brunt of the storm's destruction. In all, Hurricane Floyd caused 51 fatalities in North Carolina, much of them from freshwater flooding, as well as billions in damage. The storm surge from the large hurricane amounted to 9\u201310\u00a0ft (2.7\u20133.0\u00a0m) along the southeastern portion of the state. The hurricane also spawned numerous tornadoes, most of which caused only minor damage. Damage to power lines left over 500,000 customers without electricity at some point during the storm's passage.[2] Just weeks prior to Floyd hitting, Hurricane Dennis brought up to 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) of rain to southeastern North Carolina. When Hurricane Floyd moved across the state in early September, it produced torrential rainfall, amounting to a maximum of 19.06\u00a0in (484\u00a0mm) in Wilmington. Though it moved quickly, the extreme rainfall was due to Floyd's interaction with an approaching cold front across the area.[2] Extensive flooding, especially along NC Hwy 91 and the White Oak Loop neighborhood,  led to overflowing rivers; nearly every river basin in eastern North Carolina reached 500\u00a0year or greater flood levels.[33] Most localized flooding happened overnight; Floyd dropped nearly 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm) of rain during the hours of its passage and many residents were not aware of the flooding until the water came into their homes. The U. S. Navy, National Guard and the Coast Guard performed nearly 1700 fresh water rescues of people trapped on the roofs of their homes due to the rapid rise of the water. By contrast, many of the worst affected areas did not reach peak flood levels for several weeks after the storm, as the water accumulated in rivers and moved downstream (see flood graphic at right). The passage of Hurricane Irene four weeks later contributed an additional 6 in (150\u00a0mm) of rain over the still-saturated area, causing further flooding. The Tar River suffered the worst flooding, exceeding 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches; it crested 24\u00a0ft (7.3\u00a0m) above flood stage. Flooding began in Rocky Mount, as much as 30% of which was underwater for several days. In Tarboro, much of the downtown was under several feet of water.[34] Nearby, the town of Princeville was largely destroyed when the waters of the Tar poured over the town's levee, covering the town with over 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) of floodwater for ten days.[35] Further downstream, Greenville suffered very heavy flooding; damages in Pitt County alone were estimated at $1.6\u00a0billion (1999\u00a0USD, $2.81\u00a0billion 2022\u00a0USD).[13] Washington, where the peak flood level was observed, was likewise devastated. Some residents in Greenville had to swim six feet underwater to reach the front doors of their homes and apartments.[36] Due to the heavy flooding in downtown Greenville, the East Carolina Pirates were forced to relocate their football game against #9 Miami to N.C. State's Carter\u2013Finley Stadium in Raleigh, where they beat the Hurricanes 27\u201323.[37] The Neuse River, Roanoke River, Waccamaw River, and New River exceeded 500-year flood levels, although damage was lower in these areas (compared to the Tar River) because of lower population densities. Because most of the Cape Fear River basin was west of the peak rainfall areas, the city of Wilmington was spared the worst flooding despite having the highest localized rainfall; however, the Northeast Cape Fear River (a tributary) did exceed 500-year flood levels. Of the state's eastern rivers, only the Lumber River escaped catastrophic flooding.[33] Rainfall and strong winds affected many homes across the state, destroying 7,000, leaving 17,000 uninhabitable, and damaging 56,000. Ten thousand people resided in temporary shelters following the storm. The extensive flooding resulted in significant crop damage. As quoted by North Carolina Secretary of Health and Human Services H. David Bruton, \"Nothing since the Civil War has been as destructive to families here. The recovery process will be much longer than the water-going-down process.\"[13] Around 31,000 jobs were lost from over 60,000 businesses through the storm, causing nearly $4\u00a0billion (1999\u00a0USD, $7.02\u00a0billion 2022\u00a0USD) in lost business revenue.[38] In much of the affected area, officials urged people to either boil water or buy bottled water during Floyd's aftermath.[39] In contrast to the problems eastern North Carolina experienced, much of the western portion of the state remained under a severe drought.[13]"

The highest sustained winds in the state were 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) at Langley Air Force Base.[2] Wind gusts were much stronger, reaching 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) on the James River Bridge.[41] Floyd's winds and rains knocked down hundreds of trees across the state, some centuries old.[40] The heavy rains washed out several roads, and closed regional routes including Interstate 95 between Emporia and Petersburg, U.S. Route 58 between Emporia and Franklin, and U.S. Route 460 near Wakefield.[41] The rainfall led to overflowing rivers in the Chowan River Basin, some of which exceeded 500-year flood levels.[33] The Blackwater River reached 100-year flood levels and flooded Franklin with 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) of water. Extensive road damage occurred there, isolating the area from the rest of the state. Some 182 businesses and 150 houses were underwater in Franklin from the worst flooding in 60\u00a0years. In addition, two dams along the Rappahannock River burst from the extreme flooding. Throughout all of Virginia, Floyd damaged 9,250 houses.[40] In addition to the heavy rainfall, tides in Norfolk were 3.9\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above normal, resulting moderate to locally severe coastal flooding. Along the Chesapeake Bay, Floyd produced a 5 to 7\u00a0ft (1.5 to 2.1\u00a0m) storm surge, causing up to 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) of flooding in Accomack County homes.[41] Floyd's winds and rains knocked down hundreds of trees across the state, some centuries' old.[40]"

The storm knocked down trees and dropped heavy rainfall, causing a shop on New York Avenue NW to close after the roof collapsed.[40] The hurricane's rainbands moved across Maryland, dropping 12.59\u00a0in (320\u00a0mm) of rainfall in Chestertown, Maryland.[42] Statewide, about 450\u00a0people required evacuated from low-lying areas. A mudslide in Anne Arundel County stranded five trains carrying about 1,000\u00a0passengers. Flooding closed 225\u00a0roads statewide, with dozens of motorists requiring rescue, and more than 90\u00a0bridges were damaged. A man in Centreville died while attempting to jump a washed out bridge on his motorcycle. High tides, 2 to 3\u00a0ft (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) above normal, affected coastal areas of St. Mary's, Calvert, Harford, and Anne Arundel counties, with 5\u00a0houses destroyed and 23 severely damaged. Flooding inundated the only bridge to St. George Island, stranding six people. The highest statewide wind gust \u2013 71\u00a0mph (114\u00a0km/h) \u2013 occurred in Tall Timbers, while the highest wind gust in eastern Maryland was 52\u00a0mph (83\u00a0km/h) in Ocean City.[43][20] The winds knocked down hundreds of trees, including the nearly 400\u00a0year\u2013old Liberty Tree at St. John's College in Annapolis.[43][44] The winds also knocked down power lines, leaving about 500,000\u00a0customers without electricity. Two people were injured, and one person killed, from Carbon monoxide poisoning related to using a generator. The Anne Arundel county fair was canceled for the first time in its history.[43] In Baltimore, the Baltimore Orioles postponed a baseball game.[45] Statewide damage was estimated at $7.9\u00a0million.[46] In Delaware, Hurricane Floyd left $8.42\u00a0million in damage.[21] The storm dropped torrential rainfall, reaching 12.58\u00a0in (320\u00a0mm) in Greenwood, Delaware.[42] During the storm, Greenwood recorded 10.58\u00a0in (269\u00a0mm), breaking the record for the state's highest 24\u00a0hour rainfall total. The rains caused record crests along rivers and streams in New Castle County. The White Clay Creek crested at 17.6\u00a0ft (5.4\u00a0m), and was above flood stage for 18\u00a0hours. Statewide, Floyd damaged 171\u00a0homes, and caused 33\u00a0homes to be condemned. Flooding closed hundreds of roads and bridges, with two bridges and a few miles of track belonging to the Wilmington and Western Railroad washed out. Dozens of motorists required rescue. Winds in the state reached 64\u00a0mph (104\u00a0km/h) at Cape Henlopen along the coast. The winds knocked down hundreds of trees and power lines, leaving about 25,000\u00a0people without power.[2][21] As Floyd continued up the coast, it dropped heavy rainfall in New Jersey, reaching 14.13\u00a0in (359\u00a0mm) in Little Falls; this was the highest statewide rain from a tropical cyclone since 1950.[47] Following the state's fourth-worst drought in a century,[48] the rains collected in rivers and streams, causing record flooding at 18\u00a0river gauges, and mostly affecting the Raritan, Passaic, and Delaware basins.[49][22] Statewide damage totaled $250\u00a0million (1999\u00a0USD), much of it in Somerset and Bergen counties. This made Floyd the costliest natural disaster in New Jersey's history, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Irene in 2011.[50] Seven people died in New Jersey during Floyd's passage \u2013 six due to drowning, and one in a traffic accident. A police lieutenant took his life after working for nearly 48\u00a0hours coordinating floodwater rescues. In Bound Brook, the Raritan crested at a record 42.5\u00a0ft (13.0\u00a0m) on September 16, well above the 28\u00a0ft (8.5\u00a0m) flood stage, and exceeding the previous record of 37.5\u00a0ft (11.4\u00a0m) set during Tropical Storm Doria in 1971. Downtown Bound Brook was flooded 13\u00a0ft (4.0\u00a0m), causing 200\u00a0buildings to be condemned. In Manville, the Raritan crested at a record 27.5\u00a0ft (8.4\u00a0m), nearly double the flood stage of 14\u00a0ft (4.3\u00a0m). Parts of Manville were flooded to a depth of 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m), which damaged 1,500\u00a0homes, caused 284\u00a0homes to be condemned, and forced 1,000\u00a0people to evacuate. A water treatment plant was damaged in Bridgewater Township, forcing nearly 500,000\u00a0people in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, and Somerset counties to boil water for eight days.[22][49] The Rochelle Park, New Jersey hub of Electronic Data Systems was inundated by the nearby Saddle River, disrupting service to as many as 8,000 ATMs across the United States.[51]  Flooding in an adjoining Bell Atlantic switching facility cut off phone service to one million customers in the area.[52] In Pennsylvania, Floyd killed 13\u00a0people, largely due to drownings, fallen trees, or heart attacks, and another 40\u00a0people were severely injured. The hurricane left about $60\u00a0million in damage, mostly related to its heavy rainfall, which peaked at 12.13\u00a0in (308\u00a0mm) in Marcus Hook.[42] The highest wind gust was 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) occurred at the Commodore Barry Bridge. The two hardest-hit counties were Delaware and Bucks, where more than 10,000\u00a0homes were flooded, including 200 that were damaged to the point of being uninhabitable. More than 4,000\u00a0people statewide lost their homes due to the storm. Many creeks swelled to record levels, in some cases over double their estimated flood stage, which left motorists in need of rescue, including a bus with 11\u00a0students in Buckingham Township. Statewide, Floyd left over 500,000\u00a0homes and businesses without power.[53] As Floyd moved through New York, its precipitation reached 12.21\u00a0in (310\u00a0mm) in Cairo. Floyd's rainfall resulted in flooding that killed two people in the state, and caused several creeks and rivers to exceed their banks. In the Albany area, Normans Kill rose to extremely high levels, and the resultant flood waters damaged nearby buildings. The floods washed out portions of several roads, and destroyed a dam on a mill pond near Lake Placid. The Saw Mill and Bronx rivers both overflowed, causing urban flooding. The heavy rainfall triggered mudslides on the bluffs overlooking the Hudson River near the Tappan Zee Bridge. Winds in the state reached 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) at Stewart International Airport. The winds, combined with saturated ground from the rainfall, knocked down hundreds of trees and power lines, leaving over 100,000\u00a0people without power. Damage was estimated at $14.6\u00a0million.[13][54][2]"

One person drowned in the state due to the swollen Quinnipiac River.[55] Floyd's effects in Rhode Island were limited to rainfall and winds, which brought down trees and power lines.[56] Wind gusts in Massachusetts reached 76\u00a0mph (122\u00a0km/h) at the New Bedford Hurricane Barrier, strong enough to knock down power lines.[57] In New Hampshire, Floyd's winds caused power outages for about 10,000\u00a0people, while heavy rains rose the banks of rivers.[58] In Randolph, Vermont, a tree fell onto a mobile home, killing its occupant.[59] About 15,000\u00a0residents were affected by power outages in Maine.[60] The remnants of Floyd produced rainfall and gusty winds from Ontario to Atlantic Canada, with 118\u00a0km/h (73\u00a0mph) occurring along the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec, the strongest winds in the country.[23] The high winds damaged corn and other crops along the river's south shore from the l'Amiante to Bellechasse regions.[61] The highest rainfall in Canada also occurred in eastern Quebec, reaching 4.8\u00a0in (122\u00a0mm). Power outages affected Montreal and Quebec City, causing classes to be canceled at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Inclement weather was a potential factor in a five car accident on Autoroute 15 in Quebec City. Minor traffic accidents also occurred in the Maritimes. Heavy rainfall backed up storm drains in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The Confederation Bridge connecting Prince Edward Island to the mainland shut down during the storm due to 72 miles per hour (116\u00a0km/h) winds.

Fully three weeks after the storm hit, Jesse Jackson complained to FEMA Director James Lee Witt on his CNN program Both Sides Now, \"It seemed there was preparation for Hurricane Floyd, but then came Flood Floyd. Bridges are overwhelmed, levees are overwhelmed, whole towns under water ... [it's] an awesome scene of tragedy. So there's a great misery index in North Carolina.\" Witt responded, \"We're starting to move the camper trailers in. It's been so wet it's been difficult to get things in there, but now it's going to be moving very quickly. And I think you're going to see a\u2014I think the people there will see a big difference [within] this next weekend.\"[citation needed] Runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of North Carolina's rivers and sounds. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, freshwater runoff, sediment, and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in Pamlico Sound and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero. This raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills, as had happened after Hurricane Fran and Hurricane Bonnie, and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries. Strangely, however, the year's shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous; one possible explanation is that runoff from Hurricane Dennis caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters, so they were less vulnerable to Floyd's ill effects.[1] Pollution from runoff was also a significant fear. Numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters, particularly in the Neuse River. Overall, however, the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in Hurricane Fran, likely because Floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them.[33] When the hurricane hit North Carolina, it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 million gallons of manure into the rivers, which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality.[64] Ronnie Kennedy, Duplin County director for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times the average across eastern North Carolina, had faecal coliform bacteria. Normally, tests showing any hint of faeces in drinking water, an indication that it can be carrying disease-causing pathogens, are cause for immediate action.[65]"

The lack of electricity caused issues with the reporting of the fire, and the outage continued through the height of the event.[10] The fire forced the evacuations of 25,000 people and caused the air quality to be very poor.[11] Residents said that \"they can't walk or drive\", and that fires are a routine.[3] Rancho So\u00f1ado, home of the Orange County Department of Education's \"Inside the Outdoors\" learning program, was mostly destroyed by the wildfire.[11] Shelter was not provided due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[12] An eight-year-old female mountain lion tagged as F121, one of approximately 15 to 20 known to live in the Santa Ana mountain range, was killed by the wildfire.[13] The Bond Fire left much of the vegetation in its path burned, depriving the soil of stability. On January 28, 2021, a voluntary evacuation order was issued in anticipation of a rain storm that posed a threat of mudflows. California Conservation Corps crews worked that day to remove debris that would become dangerous in the event of a mudflow.[14] Heavy rain that night caused mudflows that blocked some roads in Silverado Canyon, rendering them impassible. At least one home was evacuated mandatorily and Orange County Public Works crews helped to clear the mud with bulldozers.[15] A second series of mudflows occurred in Silverado Canyon on the morning of March 10, 2021.[16] The mudflows prompted the mandatory evacuations of residents in Silverado, Williams, and Modjeska Canyons, all as a result of their Bond Fire burn scar proximity.[17] The mudflows damaged and trapped several cars, but no injuries were initially reported.[18] On December 14, 2021, a large storm swept through the Southern California area, triggering mudflows in Silverado Canyon for the third time since the Bond Fire. Foothill areas experienced up to 7 inches of rain during the storm. The three communities near the fire burn scar were mandatorily evacuated, but firefighters still had to rescue several residents.[19] The day after the storm, five houses in Silverado Canyon were red-tagged, several cars were damaged, and many trees were uprooted.[20] On December 23, 2021, Silverado Canyon experienced more mudflows related to the winter rain frequent in the region's Mediterranean (Csa) climate. The event impacted several roads in the community, particularly near the intersection of Silverado Canyon Road and Olive Drive.[21] Another mandatory evacuation order was issued on December 30 but ultimately was downgraded to voluntary status as the rain was not as severe as expected.[22]"

The eighth tropical disturbance of the season, Ernest formed from a persistent area of thunderstorms in the central Indian Ocean. It initially moved southwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Ernest on January\u00a020 while moving into the Mozambique Channel. After hitting Mayotte, the storm quickly intensified to reach peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph 10\u00a0minute winds) off the western coast of Madagascar. Ernest weakened slightly before striking the southwest portion of that country on January\u00a023, producing widespread flooding and gusty winds. The next day the cyclone became extratropical before dissipating on January\u00a025. On Mayotte, Ernest produced peak wind gusts of 98\u00a0km/h (61\u00a0mph). The storm drew moisture away from Malawi, causing a nine-day period of dry conditions. A few days after Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi affected the same region and produced further flooding. The combined effects of the storms killed 78\u00a0people and left over 32,000 homeless.

It developed outflow and gradually organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on January\u00a017. That day, the MF discontinued advisories after the system briefly halted its development trend. The disturbance continued its movement to the west-southwest, and on January\u00a019 began intensifying.[1] That day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S to the north of the northern coast of Madagascar.[3] After continued development, MF upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Ernest on January\u00a020.[1] After attaining tropical storm status, Ernest entered the Mozambique Channel and turned to the southwest.[4] It developed outflow on opposite sides of the storm, and an eye gradually became evident.[1] While strengthening, Ernest moved over Mayotte and passed southeast of Comoros.[4] By late on January\u00a020, the storm rapidly intensified over warm waters into a tropical cyclone \u2013 the equivalent of a 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) hurricane. Around that time, Ernest had turned to the south, along the western periphery of a ridge.[1] On January\u00a022, MF upgraded the storm into an intense tropical cyclone with peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph 10\u00a0minute winds) when it was located off the west coast of Madagascar.[2] At around the same time, the JTWC estimated Ernest attained peak winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph 1\u00a0minute sustained).[3] While at peak intensity, Ernest was a small cyclone with gales extending 130\u00a0km (80\u00a0mi) outward from the well-defined eye.[1] After maintaining peak winds for about 12\u00a0hours, the cyclone began weakening while turning to the southeast.[2] On January\u00a023, Ernest made landfall on the southwest coast of Madagascar at Itampolo,[4] with winds estimated at 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). The cyclone accelerated to the southeast across the island and quickly weakened into a tropical storm. Late on January\u00a023, the JTWC issued its last advisory after Ernest began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.[1] Early the next day, MF declared Ernest extratropical, and continued tracking it until the storm dissipated on January\u00a025 in the southern Indian Ocean.[2][4]"

Sustained winds reached 78\u00a0km/h (48\u00a0mph), and wind gusts peaked at 98\u00a0km/h (61\u00a0mph).[1] Effects on the island were minimal. Cyclone Ernest indirectly affected Malawi, located inland in southeast Africa. The storm's circulation removed moisture from the country and prevented any rainfall from occurring in the southern part of the country during a nine-day period.[4] In southern Madagascar, the cyclone produced high winds and heavy rainfall. The highest rainfall was a 24\u2011hour total of 237.2\u00a0mm (9.34\u00a0in), and the highest wind gust was 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), both of which observed in Toliara. Many fishermen in the area were not aware of the storm's approach, and several of them died as a result. About five days after Cyclone Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi struck the same general area, causing additional flooding. The combined effects of Ernest and Felapi killed 39\u00a0people, injured 104, and left 214\u00a0people missing as of February\u00a025, 2005.[4] Later, the death toll was finalized at 78 in the International Disaster Database.[5] The storms damaged 5,792\u00a0buildings, and there were 32,191\u00a0people left homeless. The floods damaged about 4,483\u00a0hectares (11,078\u00a0acres) of crop fields in southern Madagascar.[4] Portions of the country faced shortages of rice due to crop damage from Ernest, as well as from Cyclone Gafilo in the previous year. This caused prices to increase, resulting in street protests.[6] As a result, the World Food Programme provided 45\u00a0tons of rice to affected residents, although persistent flooding disrupted relief work. In general, damage from Ernest and Felapi were less than that from Gafilo in the previous year.[7] Madagascar's National Emergency Centre deployed workers to do search and rescue missions and provide water to storm victims.[8]"

The fire threatened the community of Jacob Lake, Arizona, resulting in its evacuation. Select highways were closed, including Highway 67, which resulted in closure of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Additionally, areas of the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness were inaccessible due to closures. Four buildings were destroyed, including two historic cabins.

        "content": "The Mangum Fire was reported at approximately 3 PM on June 8, 2020 on the Kaibab Plateau near Mangum Camp about 1 3/4 miles north of Big Springs, Arizona in Kaibab National Forest. By the time fire crews responded, the fire had grown to 70 acres (28\u00a0ha). Smoke was reported as visible from Fredonia, Arizona, a small town that serves as the gateway to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.[3] By the next day, June 9, the fire had grown to an estimated 500 acres (202\u00a0ha). Four hotshot crews and airtankers were called in to fight the fire.[4] Crews dropped fire retardant on the south side, with the intention of keeping the fire from spreading towards Big Springs.[5] On June 10, the United States Forest Service (USFS) reported that crews were able to control the fire due to low winds and that dozers were to start creating boundaries in order to contain the fire. Fire managers hoped to contain the fire in areas that had recently burned as part of a prescribed burn.[5] Control efforts led to the fire being at two percent containment by June 11.[6] However, by the afternoon of June 11, high winds caused the fire to jump containment lines and the fire began moving northeast. The fire destroyed two cabins and two outbuildings at Mangum Camp. By the evening, the fire had grown to 2,238 acres (906\u00a0ha), red flag warnings were in place, and evacuations were ordered for Jacob Lake, Arizona starting June 12.[7][8] By the morning of June 13, red flag winds caused the Mangum Fire to grow substantially \u2013 to over 10,000 acres (4,047\u00a0ha). The fire grew by ten miles to the north with embers jumping half a mile ahead of the fire, breaching control lines. Crews created defensible space around structures in Jacob Lake and burn outs to divert the fire from the community. State Route 89A was closed from Marble Canyon to Fredonia, Arizona and Highway 67 to the Grand Canyon.[9] The fire jumped State Route 89A that day, moving northeast.[10] On June 14, the Mangum Fire jumped control lines towards Mangum Springs, Arizona, being fueled by grass, brush and pinyon-juniper.[11] Two days later, by the morning of June 16, the fire had grown to 47,561 acres (19,247\u00a0ha), fueled by sage-grassland, and three percent containment and had crossed onto lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management.[12] The next day, three homes were evacuated on Houserock Road due to the fire moving northeast towards the area.[13] Winds from the fire began affecting air quality, with residents in Tuba City, Arizona and areas west of the fire being told to limit outdoor activities if they are sensitive to smoke.[14] The USFS reported that the historic Jacob Lake Ranger Station was narrowly spared from the fire, burning \"within feet\" of the building.[15] While the exact cause of the fire remains unknown, officials confirmed on June 20 that the fire was human caused.[2] The fire began moving east on June 21, with a large smoke plume appearing, requiring further use of air support to fight the growth. Due to the closure of the Arizona portion of House Rock Valley Road, parts of Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, specifically Coyote Buttes and White Pockets became inaccessible.[16][17] The fire remains active on the northeast side on the north side of Highway 89A due to hard to reach terrain. As a result, incident command added more fire crews to fight the fire.[18] Air support continues, with tankers flying out of St. George Regional Airport.[19] Due to evacuation orders and threats to power sources in the area, electricity was turned off at North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park and Jacob Lake. On June 25, the power was restored. Additionally, the containment percentage was re-calculated and went from 68 percent to 46 percent.[20] On June 27, the Wire Pass Fire started on the west side of House Rock Valley Road, burning \"extremely close,\" to the Mangum Fire.[21] Highway 89A and Highway 67 were reopened on the morning of June 29, 2020 and evacuation orders were lifted for Jacob Lake and White Sage.[22] Evacuation orders were lifted for the two houses on House Rock Valley Road, however, evacuation warnings were put in place just in case the fire threat changed.[23] By the start of July, the fire grew in containment to 67 percent. Fire suppression repair began.[24] As of July 7, the fire has burned 71,450 acres (28,915\u00a0ha) and was 88 percent contained.[25]"

        "content": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Pam was the second most intense tropical cyclone of the South Pacific Ocean in terms of sustained winds and is regarded as one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Vanuatu.[2] A total of 15\u201316\u00a0people died either directly or indirectly as a result of Pam with many others injured. The storm's impacts were also felt, albeit to a lesser extent, to other islands in the South Pacific, most notably the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and New Zealand. Pam is the third most intense storm of the South Pacific Ocean according to pressure, after Winston of 2016 and Zoe of 2002. It is also the second most intense tropical cyclone in 2015, only behind Hurricane Patricia. In addition, Pam is tied with Orson, Monica, Marcus and Fantala for having the second strongest ten-minute maximum sustained winds in the Southern Hemisphere. Thousands of homes, schools and buildings were damaged or destroyed, with an estimated 3,300 people displaced as a result. Pam formed on 6 March, east of the Solomon Islands and tracked slowly in a generally southward direction, slowly intensifying as it did so. Two days later, the disturbance reached tropical cyclone intensity and, over subsequent days, Pam gradually strengthened before reaching Category\u00a05 cyclone status on both the Australian and Saffir\u2013Simpson scales on 12 March. The next day, Pam's sustained winds peaked at 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph) as the storm moved through Vanuatu, passing near several constituent islands and making direct hits on others. On 14 March, Pam's winds began to slowly weaken, but its pressure dropped further to a minimum of 896 mbar (hPa; 26.46\u00a0inHg) before rising shortly afterwards. Over the next few days, the cyclone's weakening accelerated as it moved poleward. On 15 March, Pam passed northeast of New Zealand before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone that same day. Early in Pam's history, a damaging storm surge was felt in Tuvalu, forcing a state of emergency declaration after 45\u00a0percent of the nation's residents were displaced. Torrential rainfall occurred in the southeastern Solomon Islands, particularly in the Santa Cruz Islands. In Vanuatu, all emergency centres were activated and relief personnel were put on standby with Pam assessed as having the potential to be one of the nation's worst tropical cyclones. Catastrophic damage occurred as the storm moved through the archipelago, particularly in Efate, the location of the Ni-Vanuatu capital of Port Vila; and the Tafea islands of Erromango and Tanna. The cyclone crippled Vanuatu's infrastructure: an estimated 90\u00a0percent of the nation's buildings were impacted by the storm's effects, telecommunications were paralysed, and water shortages continue to plague the small nation.  Pam later brought heavy winds and rough surf to New Zealand's North Island during its weakening stages."

        "content": "During the opening days of March 2015, a major westerly wind burst occurred, which subsequently contributed to the development of the  2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event and the development of two tropical cyclones near Kiribati on either side of the equator.[3] The first tropical cyclone became Tropical Storm Bavi and impacted the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands as well as the Philippines. The second system was first noted as Tropical Disturbance 11F by the Fiji Meteorological Service\u00a0(FMS) during 6 March, while it was located about 750 kilometres (465\u00a0mi) to the north-east of Honiara in the Solomon Islands.[4] The system was located underneath an upper-level ridge of high pressure and within an area favourable for further development with low-moderate vertical windshear.[4][5] As a result, weather forecast models anticipated the development of a significant tropical cyclone over the coming days.[5] Initially, the disturbance floundered east of the Solomon Islands and slowly strengthened,[6] reaching tropical depression intensity on 8 March. The storm's appearance and areal coverage of showers remained stationary until the following day,[7] when the formation of rainbands wrapping about the centre of the system prompted the FMS to upgrade the storm's classification to a category\u00a01 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone scale, assigning it the name Pam.[8] Atmospheric conditions at the time were slightly favourable for continued development as the storm continued to slowly track along the southern periphery of a high-pressure area to its north.[9] Following the storm's naming, Pam began to curve southwards around midday on 9 March. Computer models continued to point towards the possibility of rapid intensification occurring as the cyclone approached Vanuatu.[10] Significant development in Pam's organisation took place throughout the remainder of the day into 10 March.[11] The cyclone's circulation centre quickly tightened, with the central dense overcast atop it persisting in strength.[12] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on 10 March, the FMS upgraded the system to category\u00a03 strength, making it a severe tropical cyclone.[13] Shortly after, microwave imagery revealed a primordial eye-feature developing within Pam;[14] this became apparent on visible light images on 11 March.[15] That day, Pam became quasi-stationary east of the Santa Cruz Islands before resuming its prior southwesterly motion towards the end of 11 March.[16][17] The storm's eye continued to warm as its cloud tops cooled such that at 12:00\u00a0UTC, the FMS assessed Pam to have reached Category\u00a05 intensity on the Australian cyclone scale.[18] Six hours later, the JTWC estimated that the storm reached Category\u00a05-equivalent intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale as Pam was east of Penama.[19] Early on 13 March, the JTWC determined Pam reached its peak one-minute sustained winds of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) as it neared Vanuatu;[20] this was increased to 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph) in post-season reanalysis. Several hours later, the cyclone began to curve towards the south-southeast, allowing Pam to pass just east of Efate.[21] At that time, the FMS estimated Pam as having record-breaking 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph) ten-minute sustained winds.[22] The storm's winds gradually slowed afterwards as Pam tracked west of Tafea. However, the FMS indicated that the cyclone's pressure dropped further to a minimum of 896 mbar (hPa; 26.46\u00a0inHg) on 14 March,[23] making Pam the second most intense tropical cyclone in the South Pacific basin after Cyclone Zoe in 2002.[24] This intensity was short-lived, however, as Pam's central pressure began rising shortly thereafter as the storm accelerated southeastward.[25] After 12:00\u00a0UTC that day, Pam left the area of responsibility of the FMS and entered the monitoring region of New Zealand's MetService, who estimated that Pam weakened to Category\u00a04 intensity on 15 March after maintaining Category 5 intensity for 36\u00a0hours.[26] Shortly after, the storm's eye faded away and Pam's low level circulation became displaced from its associated thunderstorms, signalling a rapid weakening phase.[27] Later on 15 March, both agencies discontinued issuing advisories as Pam entered a phase of extratropical transition while affecting northeastern New Zealand. The system moved eastwards, and eventually dissipated over the waters of the South Pacific on 20 March."

Completely destroyed. By 12 March, the National Disaster Management Office in Vanuatu activated all emergency operation centres in the country. Officials reported difficulty in contacting outlying islands where there was poor infrastructure. In those areas, they advised residents to identify nearby shelters in case evacuation was necessary. Across the country, residents spent the day on 12 March stocking up on supplies for the storm. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies stated volunteers were on standby for assessments in Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu once the storm passed. Supplies of water and water purification systems were pre-positioned for the countries.[30] Acting director of the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office, Peter Korisa, warned that should Pam strike the capital of Port Vila it could be worse than Cyclone Uma in 1987 which killed 50\u00a0people and caused US$150\u00a0million in damage.[31] The death toll from Cyclone Pam is uncertain, with totals from the Vanuatu Government and United Nations differing. According to Vanuatu, 11\u00a0people died as a direct result of Pam. Four others died at Vila Central Hospital shortly after the storm's passage, though these are considered indirectly related.[32] According to the United Nations, a total of 16\u00a0people were killed.[33] In the immediate aftermath, media outlets indicated unconfirmed reports of 44\u00a0casualties in the many villages destroyed by the storm;[34][35][36] however, these claims were never substantiated.[33] According to UNICEF, at least 132,000\u00a0people have been impacted by Tropical Cyclone Pam, of whom 54,000\u00a0are children.[37] Communication across the country was crippled, with only one cellular tower in Port Vila remaining operational. The power grid was devastated as well and officials estimated repairs could take weeks.[38] Four days after the storm, nearly 60\u00a0of the nation's inhabited islands remained cut-off from the outside world.[39] UNICEF has estimated that up to 90\u00a0percent of the buildings in Vanuatu have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Pam. Hospitals, schools and water supply are either compromised or destroyed.[37] Journalist Michael McLennan in Port Vila likened the effects of Pam to a bomb: \"It's like a bomb has gone through...It's really quite apocalyptic.\" Sune Gudnitz, head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated that Pam was indeed a worst-case scenario for Vanuatu.[40] Catastrophic damage occurred on the islands of Erromango and Tanna. Communication with the islands was completely severed during the storm, and first contact with residents did not take place until two days after Pam's passage. A pilot who flew to the islands reported that all infrastructure had been crippled, with every structure severely damaged or destroyed. Concrete buildings held up during the storm, but lost their roofs. Locals reported two fatalities on Tanna, though this was unconfirmed by officials. Additionally, there was no drinkable water left on the island.[42] Approximately 95\u00a0percent of the homes on Tongoa were reportedly destroyed.[39] Total damage in Vanuatu reached VT63.2\u00a0billion (US$600\u00a0million).[43] North of Efate, the small island of Mataso was largely destroyed with only two homes left standing after the storm. Residents sought refuge in caves to ride out the storm; two people died there.[41] The Tukoro, Vanuata's most significant patrol vessel, was washed ashore on Moso Island.[44]  Repairs took 16 months. According to UNESCO, a total of $268.4\u00a0million is needed for total recovery and rehabilitation of the nation.[45]"

Sufficient repairs of Bauerfield International Airport were completed by 14 March to allow the first flights from Australia carrying aid to arrive. Initial monetary assistance included $3.8\u00a0million from Australia, $2.9\u00a0million from the United Kingdom, $1.8\u00a0million from New Zealand, and $1.05\u00a0million from the European Union, $250,000 from India and promised to extend any further assistance required.[84] The French overseas territories of New Caledonia and French Polynesia have granted \u20ac300,000 (US$318,000) of immediate emergency aid.[85][86] Australia, France, and New Zealand enacted a coordinated response within the framework of the FRANZ agreement, in which France would carry out damage assessments while Australia and New Zealand would provide humanitarian aid. In accordance with this, France ordered the frigate Vend\u00e9miaire to sail from Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia, to conduct surveys along with aircraft from the island territory.[84] On 15 March, Australia confirmed that supplies for up to 5,000\u00a0people would be sent via two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Boeing C-17 Globemaster III aircraft. A Lockheed C-130 Hercules was also deployed with emergency evaluation personnel and Department of Foreign Affairs officials to determine specifics on aid required.[79] On 15 March a CASA-235 transport plane was dispatched from the New Caledonian Armed Forces airbase carrying engineers to repair the water supply, a Red Cross technician and spare parts to enable the reopening of the airport to scheduled flights.[87] A second CASA-235 was dispatched from French Polynesia carrying tools for rebuilding, satelitte communications, tents and logistics supplies for 10 days.[88] More than four days after the storm, much of the affected population had yet to be reached. A lack of airstrips and deepwater ports hampered the speed of relief operations.[39] Save the Children's Vanuatu director, Tom Skirrow, stated that the logistical challenges presented with Cyclone Pam greatly exceeded that of Typhoon Haiyan which left over 7,350\u00a0dead or missing in the Philippines during November 2013.[29] Residents on Moso Island, located just north of Efate, were forced to drink saltwater. Survivors stated that no aid had reached them as of 17 March, and most were forced to scavenge for food.[39] It was not until 27 March, two weeks after Pam struck, that aid finally reached all of the affected islands.[89] On 24 March, IsraAid reached Tongoa in the Shepherds Islands group by boat,[90] and distributed over 40 tons of rice, flour and water to twelve villages and eight schools on two islands levelled by the cyclone.[91] The Adventist Development and Relief Agency responded by distributing shelter kits, water filtration kits and food packages, as well as setting up 10 evacuation centres in Port Vila.[92] In total, ADRA assisted more than 10,000 people in 2586 households across three islands."

The focus on the 81,873\u00a0CHF operation was to provide essential non-food items and shelter.[48] Flights carrying these supplies from Fiji began on 17 March.[49] Prime Minister Sopoaga stated that Tuvalu appeared capable of handling the disaster on its own and urged that international relief be focused on Vanuatu.[49][51] Tuvalu's Disaster Coordinator, Suneo Silu, said the priority island is Nui as sources of fresh water were contaminated.[49] On 17 March, the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a donation of US$61,000 in aid to Tuvalu.[94] UNICEF and Australia have committed to deliver aid to Tuvalu.[95][96] As of 22 March 71 families (40 percent of the population) of Nui remain displaced and were living in 3 evacuation centres or with other families and on Nukufetau, 76 people (13 percent of the population) remain displaced and were living in 2 evacuation centres.[97] The Situation Report published on 30 March reported that on Nukufetau all the displaced people have returned to their homes.[98] Nui suffered the most damage of the three central islands (Nui, Nukufetau and Vaitupu); with both Nui and Nukufetau suffering the loss of 90% of the crops.[98] Of the three northern islands (Nanumanga, Niutao, Nanumea), Nanumanga suffered the most damage, with 60\u2013100 houses flooded and damage to the health facility. The number of influenza cases that had been reported in Nanumanga had stabilised.[98]"

Many people were forced to flee in the darkness due to ongoing power shutoffs in the region.[9] From an analysis of the historical GPS data, it was predicted that 35% of householders evacuated while the remaining decided to stay and defend their property. These results are comparable with the evacuation percentages observed in the previous wildfire affecting the same area: the 2017 Tubbs Fire.[16]  On the other hand, find from a questionnaire study indicate that 79% of householders decided to evacuate.[17] Finally, traffic data indicate that the traffic slow down during the evacuation stage which might indicate congestions in some areas.[18] The Sonoma County government, in conjunction with Esri, published an interactive map containing incidents and evacuation zones associated with the fires.[19] Sonoma\u2013Marin Area Rail Transit commuter rail offered free service between October 30 and November 6 initially as far north as Downtown Santa Rosa, then eventually on the whole line for those needing transportation alternatives.[20]"

On September 2, shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the low became more concentrated, and the surface circulation became better defined. Although the disturbance still lacked a well-defined center by the following morning, the continued trend of organization and the system's threat to northeastern Mexico resulted in the issuance of advisories on Potential Tropical Cyclone Seven at 09:00 UTC September 3.[2] Shortly thereafter, first-light visible satellite images indicated the presence of a well-defined center of circulation, signifying the formation of a tropical depression at 15:00 UTC.[3] The cyclone continued to become better organized, and scatterometer data from 16:00 UTC that day revealed an area of tropical storm-force winds to the west of the center. Based on this data, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Fernand at 18:00 UTC on September 3.[4] Fernand continued to quickly strengthen as it moved westward, and by 03:00 UTC on September 4, it attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), as evidenced by an NOAA Hurricane hunter aircraft investigating the system. Although the cyclone was forecast to strengthen further before reaching the Mexican coast, the effects of moderate easterly to southeasterly wind shear and the entrainment of dry air into the storm's circulation prevented further intensification.[5] By mid-day on September 4, much of the associated convection had moved inland over Mexico, and Fernand weakened slightly before making landfall on the northeastern coast of Mexico at around 15:15 UTC about 35 miles (56\u00a0km) north of La Pesca with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[6] Just hours after moving inland, the surface circulation of Fernand quickly became poorly defined, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC on September 4.[7] Weakening continued as Fernand moved further inland, and at 03:00 UTC on September 5, the cyclone dissipated over the very rugged terrain of the Sierra Madre Oriental.[8]"

A man in Monterrey who was carried away by floodwaters along the Santa Catarina river was rescued by Civil Protection workers, and sustained no major injuries, while another man and his dog who attempted to drive through floodwaters in La Huasteca also required rescue after being caught in the strong current of the floodwaters.[13] On September 7, Governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n Jaime Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n declared a state of emergency for Nuevo Le\u00f3n, further announcing that he would request funding and resources from the National Disaster Fund to aid in repairs and relief efforts.[14] Initial damage in Nuevo Le\u00f3n was estimated to be MX$7.5\u00a0billion (US$383\u00a0million).

        "content": " Tropical Storm Matthew was a weak but deadly and destructive tropical cyclone which made landfall in Central America during the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifteenth tropical cyclone and thirteenth named storm of the year, Matthew formed on September 23 and lost its tropical characteristics in the morning of September 26. However, its remnants continued to produce life-threatening rain over parts of Central America as it dissipated. Throughout Central and South America, torrential rain produced by Matthew triggered widespread flooding and landslides. Eight people were killed by the storm in Venezuela, and at least 100 people have been confirmed dead throughout Central America and southern Mexico. In Mexico, a massive landslide, roughly 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) long, buried nearly 300 homes. Initially, officials feared hundreds of casualties, but the impact was much less fatal than expected. Despite the disastrous loss of life caused by the storm, the name Matthew was not retired and was used again in the 2016 season, though it would be retired following that season."

        "content": "The origins of Tropical Storm Matthew were from a tropical wave that emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 11. On the following day, that tropical wave contributed to the development of Hurricane Julia near Cape Verde. The southern portion of the system continued westward into the Atlantic with minimal development until September 20. After no further organization over the last eight days, convection associated with the tropical wave began to increase,[1] and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the wave as an area for potential tropical cyclogenesis on September 21, noting favorable environmental conditions.[2] However, deep convection associated with the system remained disorganized,[1] despite surface and air data indicating an organizing surface circulation.[3] A low pressure area formed on September 22 near Cura\u00e7ao in the south-central Caribbean Sea; at that point, the NHC assessed a high chance of tropical cyclone development.[4] The thunderstorm activity remained disorganized,[5] but on September 23 the convection increased and became better organized,[6]  and curved bands developed throughout the day.[1] Late that day, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed the development of a well-defined circulation, and the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Fifteen about 485\u00a0mi (781\u00a0km) east of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua.[7] However, post-analysis indicated that the system had already been a tropical depression for six hours.[1] While the National Hurricane Center initially classified the depression, it was noted in post-analysis that the system had already intensified into Tropical Storm Matthew,[1] but was operationally carried as a tropical depression until 21:00 UTC September 23. based on confirmation from Hurricane Hunters. At the time, it was moving generally westward, due to a subtropical ridge over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a path near or over Nicaragua, followed by Matthew stalling near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula due to a collapse in steering currents. There was uncertainty in the timing of the latter events, and the NHC noted that great intensification could occur if the storm remained over warm waters; this was due to favorable conditions, such as sea surface temperatures exceeding 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) and an upper-level anticyclone providing good outflow.[8] As the storm gradually strengthened during the morning of September 24 after a burst in convection, and the National Hurricane Center noted that there was a considerable uncertainty over the path Matthew would take in the long run. Some numerical models forecast the tropical storm to pass through the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula into the Bay of Campeche, while others forecast Matthew to reach the peninsula's coast, then do a sharp turn to the northeast back into the Caribbean Sea. As such, the NHC considered its track forecast\u2014and by extension, its intensity forecast\u2014to be of \"low confidence.\"[9][10] Tropical Storm Matthew attained its peak intensity on September 24, 18:00, UTC, with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (998\u00a0hPa; 29.5\u00a0inHg). Only an hour later, Matthew made landfall 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) south of the border of Nicaragua and Honduras on September 24 with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). Matthew briefly emerged into the Gulf of Honduras and did not re-intensified due to its close proximity with land. Heading west-northwestward toward Belize, Matthew made landfall near Monkey River Town with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[1] After moving inland, Matthew quickly weakened, and was a strong tropical depression only three hours later.[11] From thereon, Matthew underwent further gradual weakening while simultaneously losing forward speed as it moved over southern Mexico. In the morning of September 26, it finally justified its forecast faith by weakening to a remnant low; however, it continued to produce heavy rainfalls over parts of eastern Mexico and other parts of Central America.[12] Matthew's remnants dissipated completely over Mexico, however increased moisture and convection throughout the Bay of Campeche and Caribbean Sea contributed to the development of Tropical Storm Nicole only two days after.[1]"

Costa Rica issued a yellow alert for its coastal region, citing the chance for an indirect impact from the storm. Honduras issued a yellow alert for the Ul\u00faa River area, and issued green alerts for 11 departments of Honduras.[14] On the border with Nicaragua, small communities in the Gracias a Dios province were evacuated, forcing at least 300 people out of their homes. Authorities said that classes would be suspended until further notice and that 15,000 schools had been made available to be used as shelters.[15] Guatemalan authorities ordered evacuations in Izabal between the mouth of the Motagua River and Punta de Manabique. Additionally, the country's Institute of Seismology, Vulcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology (Insivumeh) noted that Guatemala had experienced the most rain since the 1940s as a result of previous storm systems.[16] In neighboring Belize, officials began evacuating three towns near the border with Guatemala after flood waters rose.[15]"

In Olanchito, near the northern coast, a creek overflowed and flooded a house, but firefighters were able to rescue its 10 occupants.[32] Several homes and roads were damaged and made inaccessible, as well as at least nine bridges.[33] Furthermore, there were no immediate reports of major damage; however, grain, banana, and sugarcane crops were severely damaged as rivers burst their banks.[34] There were no initial reports of casualties, though 15 people were reported missing after boarding a sailboat off the coast of Honduras.[29]"

Authorities from Puerto Barrios\u2014presumably the hardest-hit Guatemalan city\u2014reported heavy flooding and several knocked-down trees caused by potent winds.[29] The storm also produced significant flooding on sugar and coffee farms, which was believed to lead to serious sugar losses due to already-flooded cane fields from earlier rainfalls. Coffee trees also risked disease and fungus growth from too much moisture. All in all, Guatemalan sugar producers forecast that its harvest in November would be five percent lower than the 2.34 million metric tons produced in October 2009. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries as a result of Matthew in the country.[34]"

As assessments continued, concern awoke for the region's heavy agriculture production and the effects on livelihoods and economies. The storm and subsequent rainfalls have affected 255 communities, 80 municipalities in nine of the 16 provinces of the country, in the north, west and south. More than 1,000 families, some 6,200 people fled dangerous situations because of the rains in Nicaragua alone, seeking refuge in 72 active shelters.[35] Throughout the country, 66 people were reported dead as a result of heavy rainfalls associated with Matthew.[30][36] Throughout the country, the storm wrought roughly 207\u00a0million c\u00f3rdoba ($10.2\u00a0million, 2010 USD) in damage.[37]"

Thousands were forced from their homes in southern part of the country due to the rains. The city of Santa Mar\u00eda Tlahuitoltepec, in which one of the landslides occurred, has a population of 9,000, majority of whom are Mixe Indians.[42] The landslide occurred at 4 a.m. local time, in a mountainous area flooded by torrential rains.[43][44] Part of a hill collapsed on a length of 656\u00a0ft (200\u00a0m), destroying more than 300 houses. The Governor of the state, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz, earlier said that it is too early to say how many victims were trapped or buried under the earth, but initially estimated that number of missing could be 600 to 1,000 people.[45] It was later advised that eleven people were missing, and no fatalities had been initially confirmed; however, up to six people were confirmed dead several days later, finalizing the death toll.[46][47] The Mexican military has attempted to reach the town, alongside hundreds of rescue workers that had been sent in to assist the victims. However, difficulties arose due to floods and landslides along the way while attempting to reach the area. Mexican Red Cross stated that it was sending 40 health specialists, rescue dogs and 15 emergency vehicles to the area.[48]"
