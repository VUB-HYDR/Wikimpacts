Bruno made another landfall again at about 07:00 UTC on 16 January, turning towards the southwest and steadily weakening, although it continued to produce gale-force winds as it moved through the West Kimberley. After Bruno passed Port Hedland, the system moved out to sea and rapidly reintensified. Bruno reached its ultimate peak intensity at 15:00 UTC on 19 January, with winds of 90\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) and an estimated central pressure of 980 hPa (mbar). The storm once again made landfall in the Exmouth Gulf later that day. A weakened Bruno moved out to sea again the next day but the system made its final landfall south of Perth on January 22 and dissipated soon after. Bruno caused torrential rainfall to many areas of Western Australia, especially in the southwest where some stations set records for January rainfall. Severe flooding occurred in the southwest, with the Blackwood River reaching its highest level in over 25 years. Many bridges were washed away and there was extensive road and rail damage. A number of towns were flooded, with 75 houses being flooded in Nannup. Total damage was estimated at $10 million (1982 AUD, $10.9 million 1982 USD).[5]"

Wildfires killed nine people in California in 2022, destroyed 772 structures, and damaged another 104. The 2020 and 2021 wildfire seasons had the highest and second-highest (respectively) numbers of acres burned in the historical record, with a sharp drop in acreage burned. Drastic climatic and ecological conditions, including climate change and long-term drought, had led to the anticipation of another potentially above-average wildfire season on the heels of two previous such seasons in 2020 and 2021.[2] However, while the number of fires to date in 2022 was only slightly below the 5-year average (7,641 fires versus 8,049 fires), the total acreage burned was well below the 5-year average; 363,939 acres burned in 2022 thus far versus the 5-year average of 2,324,096 acres (though that average includes several of California's most significant fire seasons).[3] Peak fire season in California typically occurs in late summer and/or fall, and effectively ends when significant precipitation occurs across the state.[4] Governor of California Gavin Newsom officially marked \"the end of peak wildfire season\u201d in most of the state in mid-November.[5] The quieter fire year was received gratefully by state officials and was highlighted by multiple news outlets, which attributed the downturn in severity largely to fortunate weather patterns, such as well-timed precipitation and favorable wind conditions.[6][5] Officials were also quick to suggest that a contributing factor might have been several billion dollars invested in wildfire resilience projects, such as prescribed burning and community outreach.[5] Despite the 'quiet' year as measured in acreage, a number of significant wildfires burned in California in 2022; these include the Oak Fire in Mariposa County, which burned over 180 structures, the McKinney Fire in Siskiyou County, which caused 4 fatalities, and the Mosquito Fire in Placer and El Dorado counties, which was California's largest wildfire of the year."

In its April monthly seasonal outlook, the National Interagency Fire Center forecast above normal significant fire potential for the Bay Area, Mid Coast-Mendocino, and Sacramento Valley/Foothill areas beginning in May, due to the lack of seasonal precipitation, early start to the growing season, and long-term drought.[11] It also noted that \"A further expansion of above normal significant fire potential is forecast across most elevations during June and July.\" The Northern California Geographic Coordination Center (commonly called 'North Ops') forecast stated that \"Confidence is moderate to high for an early start to the significant large fire season.\"[12] In Northern California, peak fire season begins in the early summer (June\u2013July) and runs until late fall, varying year to year. In Southern California, the peak fire season begins in late spring (May\u2013June) and runs until fall.[4] The precise timing varies according to annual and seasonal precipitation, as well as the occurrence of offshore wind events, such as the Santa Anas, Diablo winds, or sundowner winds.[4] However, fires are possible at any time of year in the state, particularly in drier Southern California."

PG&E pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in the Camp Fire, shortly before the company exited bankruptcy in June 2020. In January 2022, Cal Fire determined that the Dixie Fire, the largest fire of the 2021 California wildfire season and largest non-complex fire in recorded California history, was caused by a tree contacting PG&E electrical distribution lines."

Chief Moore cited competition in the labor market, including with private, county, and state organizations, such as Cal Fire, as a major reason for the hiring challenges.[18] During the peak of fire season, representatives of California's private timber industry called for firefighting reserves to be augmented by the U.S. military and the National Guard, but were resisted by federal and state officials who noted the cost of such efforts and the lack of extreme resource needs during the season so far. The state has been forced to seek military assistance in the past during severe fire seasons.[19]"

As of March 22, 2022, the National Drought Mitigation Center's U.S. Drought Monitor saw the entire state in moderate to extreme drought conditions.[23] In February, their Drought Severity and Coverage (DSCI) index, which measures cumulative dryness, was at 275, or nearly twice the 20-year average of approximately 146, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.[24] This dry period is part of an ongoing 22-year spell of drought in the North American West that marks the driest such period in at least 1,200 years, according to scientific research based on analysis of soil moisture deficits and tree rings.[25][26] The drought has impacted wildfire risk and severity in a number of ways. Increased dryness of fuels, driven by increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a measure of the aridity of the atmosphere, is behind an eightfold increase in the area burned by wildfires in the summer in California since 1972, according to scientific research.[27] Drought and overcrowding have also made forests more vulnerable not just to wildfires but bark beetle infestation, which has further weakened and killed forests. Total tree mortality since 2010 exceeds 172 million, providing plentiful fuel for wildfires.[28]"

The most infamous tornado of the outbreak occurred on March\u00a014 when an isolated EF2 tornado caused widespread damage across Downtown Atlanta, Georgia, including to the CNN Center and to the Georgia Dome, which was hosting the 2008 SEC men's basketball tournament. Other buildings that were damaged include the Georgia World Congress Center, and the Omni Hotel, which was evacuated after many windows were blown out. The Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel suffered major window damage. The image of the building with all its windows blown out became famous and for a time was a symbol of the tornado. Centennial Olympic Park, SunTrust Plaza (now Truist Plaza) and historic Oakland Cemetery were also damaged.[1] One man was killed near Downtown Atlanta and 30\u00a0others were injured.[2] Two other deaths took place on March 15, in the northern Atlanta suburbs, from a second, larger round of severe weather and tornadoes. In total, 46\u00a0tornadoes were confirmed over the 24-hour period, from eastern Alabama to the Carolina coast, with most of the activity concentrated in the Metropolitan Atlanta area, the Central Savannah River Area and the Midlands of South Carolina."

The tornado moved to the southeast, which is unusual as most supercells have a strong northward component along (or ahead of) a cold front. It also was unusual because it was not associated with such a squall line at all, but was an independent supercell well ahead of the main storm system.[citation needed]"

                "content": "CNN Center was severely damaged, including shattered windows. The Georgia World Congress Center also sustained serious damage, as was the Omni Hotel, especially the skywalk between the two hotel towers over Andrew Young International Boulevard. This complex alone lost 476 windows, making it necessary to close the south tower to guests. The facades of the Georgia Dome and a Philips Arena parking garage were damaged while hosting basketball games.[64] Two of the giant columns in Centennial Olympic Park were knocked down, and insulation was stuck in trees.[65] Trees on some other streets were blown completely down, despite being too early in spring to involve leaf drag. Glass was strewn across several streets, and Atlanta Police kept residents, hotel guests, and news crews away from buildings with falling glass, which continued to pose a danger into the night.[64] Cars in the area were also damaged, and hotel and office furniture was found scattered about. The Ritz Carlton, Westin Peachtree Plaza, Georgia-Pacific Building, SunTrust Plaza (where more than 60 people had to be relocated out of their offices), Equitable Building, and Georgia State University also had windows blown out (300 at Equitable alone), as did the Tabernacle (a former church with stained glass that is now a concert venue). The windows of the Westin continued to fall for days after the tornado, forcing police to keep several city blocks and MARTA's Peachtree Center station closed to pedestrians. The Georgia World Congress Center also sustained flooding while hosting a JROTC event and the Hinman Dental Meeting; Fox Sports Net took footage of a staircase in the new section of the complex that looked like a fountain with water cascading down it. The annual Atlanta Home Show and all other events were cancelled for the weekend in the GWCC complex, as was the Atlanta St. Patrick's Day Parade scheduled for the next day. WRAS FM at Georgia State University was off the air for two days, though it was not stated whether its studio or tower sustained damage, or if this was due to security or safety concerns, or power outages. The historic Rialto Theatre at GSU also sustained roof damage, which caused water damage inside. Further east, Grady Hospital reported some damage to windows and a power outage. Many of the injured were taken there, and some walked there and were treated in the emergency room for cuts due to glass. The King Memorial MARTA station was damaged and was being bypassed by trains, with buses rerouted to the next station on each side. Oakland Cemetery suffered major damage to monuments and to its huge oaks and magnolias, and the caretaker found window blinds around the neck of a statue of a Civil War veteran buried there. In the nearby Cabbagetown area, a brick loft building (well known for the fire that occurred there in 1999, during its renovation from the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills, in which the crane operator was rescued by helicopter during live TV news coverage) lost part of its roof, and part of the top (fifth) floor. Another building at The Stacks on Boulevard was damaged; search and rescue personnel were unable to enter, but everyone was accounted for by the management within a few hours.[66] When the tornado hit, a SEC tournament game between Mississippi State and Alabama which had just been sent into overtime minutes earlier by a shot from Mykal Riley, was in progress at the Georgia Dome and being broadcast live on television. The storm ripped panels from the exterior of the building and tore two holes in the roof of the Dome, causing insulation to fall and the scoreboard and catwalks suspended from the roof to sway; much of this was captured on camera, though the transmission from the arena was interrupted. Riley's shot was considered to have saved lives by keeping people safe inside the Georgia Dome. After a 64-minute delay, the game was completed; however the next scheduled game between Kentucky and Georgia was postponed.[67] The remainder of the tournament games were played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the campus of Georgia Tech, with spectators restricted to team and conference personnel, media, team bands, and families of players only due to the much smaller size of the alternate venue.[68] At the nearby Philips Arena, little disruption was noticed by the attendees during the game between the Hawks and the Los Angeles Clippers, even though damage occurred to the outside of the arena.[69] Twenty-seven people were treated for injuries.[69] In addition, over 20 homes were completely destroyed.[70] All of CNN's TV networks remained on the air, but there was damage to the glass roof of the CNN Center atrium, flooding part of the food court. Additionally, blown-out windows in the ground floor CNN.com newsroom and the fourth floor videotape library caused minor damage. Live news coverage of the aftermath was carried on CNN International, in turn simulcast domestically on CNN until 1 am EDT.[71] CNN resumed broadcasting from their main newsroom at 6 am EDT, showing several parts of the newsroom with computer stations covered with tarps, the damaged atrium of CNN Center, and staff using trash cans and buckets to collect dripping rainwater to the right of the anchor desk due to the damaged roof. When more storms moved in later in the day, the network was forced to move all Atlanta on-camera operations to the windowless CNN-I studio, while taped programming was shown for most of the day.[72] The city received emergency assistance from the Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA), Highway Emergency Response Operators (HEROs), Fulton and DeKalb counties (where Atlanta is situated), and surrounding cities and counties. Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin also declared a state of emergency for the city [73] and Governor Sonny Perdue issued a state state of emergency declaration [74] for Atlanta enabling the city to seek disaster aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). President Bush declared a major disaster on March 20.[75] At the time, it was the most expensive tornado in Atlanta history, in raw U.S. dollars, after the 1999 Oklahoma City tornado, costing a half-billion dollars.[76]"

Fruit trees and vineyards were also affected.[7] 100 thousand cattle and 1 million sheep died because of the drought. Milk, meat and wool output declined.[7] By September 1969 only 250 thousand goats remained from an earlier population of 650 thousand.[7] Throughout rural Norte Chico, many farmers and communities came to lack water even for human consumption.[7] In 1969 farmers received support of several financial institutions and state agencies including tax exemptions and a line of credit to buy forage.[7] In Central Chile, typical river flow increases in December,  but this did not happen in 1968.[8] Chile many farmers decided to not cultivate in early summer due to this and to the known fact there was almost no snow in Andes.[8] Later in summer the rivers did grow due to glacier ablation, causing many farmers to repent albeit it was too late to cultivate.[8] The decline in hydroelectric power generation (The hydroelectric deficit was of 200 MW) was partly compensated by having the thermoelectric plants of Ventanas, Renca and Laguna Verde function at maximum capacity.[7]  National coal production from the Lota-Schwager mine was not enough to supply the need and the government authorized the import of 50 thousand tons of coal from the United States, Poland, France and Germany.[7] In the hydrological year of 1969\u20131970 the area affected by the drought diminished from previously spanning the latitudes of 27\u201336\u00b0 S to 27\u201332\u00b0 S.[8]"

                "content": " The 2014\u201315 North American winter was frigid and prolifically wintry, especially across the eastern half of North America in the months of January\u2013March. The season began early, with many places in North America experiencing their first wintry weather during mid-November. A period of below-average temperatures affected much of the contiguous United States, and several records were broken. A quasi-permanent phenomenon referred to as the polar vortex may have been partly responsible for the cold weather. Temperatures in much of the United States dropped 15 to 35\u00a0\u00b0F (8.3 to 19\u00a0\u00b0C) below average by November 19, following a southward \"dip\" of the polar vortex into the eastern two-thirds of the country. The effects of this dip were widespread, bringing about temperatures as low as 28\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22122\u00a0\u00b0C) in Pensacola, Florida.[1] Following a significant snowstorm there, Buffalo, New York received several feet of snow from November 17\u201321.[2] In addition, significant winter weather occurred throughout the season, including a major blizzard that struck the Northeastern United States at the end of January, another blizzard that affected much of the Northern United States days later in early February, and several significant snow events paired with very frigid temperatures for much of February. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2014 occurred on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2015 occurred on March 20.[3] Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28.[4] Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability. Many records for snowfall and temperature were broken, many for the month of February, with every state east of the Mississippi River being colder than average, some for the entire winter. However, this meteorological winter was the 19th-warmest of the past 120 winters over the Contiguous United States, largely due to persistent warm weather in the Western United States.[5] During the 2014\u201315 winter season, Boston broke its all-time official seasonal 107.6-inch (2.73-meter) snowfall record from the winter of 1995\u201396, with a total snowfall record of 108.6 inches (2.76\u00a0m) as of March 15, 2015.[6] An early trace of snowfall was recorded in Arkansas.[7] There were greater accumulations of snow across parts of Oklahoma as well.[8]"

                "content": "On October 16, 2014, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center issued its U.S. Winter Outlook. This outlook indicated that below-average temperatures in parts of the south-central and southeastern United States would be favored, with above-average temperatures favored in the western U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and New England. Drought conditions were expected to improve in California's southern and northwestern regions, but no improvements were expected earlier than December or January. Above-average conditions were also expected to pervade the winter months in the western U.S., the Intermountain West extending across the U.S.\u2013Canada border through New York and New England, and Alaska and Hawaii. The Precipitation Outlook favored above-average precipitation across the southern tier and Atlantic coast of the United States, with above-average precipitation also favored in southern Alaska and the Alaska panhandle. Below-average precipitation was favored in Hawaii, the northwestern United States, and near the Great Lakes region. The rest of the country was given an \"equal chance\" for either above- or below-average temperatures and/or precipitation.[9] On November 30, 2014, Environment Canada's monthly prediction system produced a forecast for the months of December, January, and February across Canada. Areas in and just off the western coast of British Columbia were considered the most likely areas for above-average temperatures. Other areas where above-average temperatures were favored by the forecast included Yukon, the Northwest Territories, northern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and northwestern parts of Manitoba. Below-average temperatures were favored in and near Lake Superior in Ontario, across much of Hudson Bay, in far-eastern parts of Nunavut, and in northern parts of Quebec. The most favorable locations for above-average precipitation were northwestern British Columbia, southwestern Yukon, eastern parts of the Northwest Territories, western parts of Nunavut, and Newfoundland. The most favorable areas for below-average precipitation were southeastern British Columbia, southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, some northern parts of Quebec, and an isolated spot in the northern half of Nunavut.[10]"

First, a cyclone in the Bering Sea enabled a change in the atmospheric pattern to occur; according to Jeff Masters from Weather Underground, this cyclone brought about a \"ripple\" in the jet stream, and the presence of a high-pressure ridge over the western United States and a low-pressure trough over the southern and central United States enabled a great intrusion of very cold air to pervade southward out of Canada.[1] Following the onset of the cold wave, multiple snow events occurred; one significant storm dropped as much as 88 inches (220\u00a0cm) of snow in a single area, and impacts covered a broad area.[2] In late November, around Thanksgiving, a nor'easter traveled up the East Coast, dropping up to a foot of snow in some areas, and causing major travel headaches for much of the country.[11] Due to the storm, over 4,500 flights were canceled and over 400,000 people were without power on November 27; southern New Hampshire was the worst hit, experiencing up to 200,000 outages.[11] December was, at the time, the second warmest across the US.[12] However, 2015, 2021 and 2023 have since had warmer Decembers, leaving 2014 in fifth.[13][14][15] In December, yet another storm impacted parts of North America; the storm brought relief to drought-stricken parts of California, but it also brought dangerous mudflows to fire-ravaged areas where the soil could not handle the excess precipitation.[16] Less than two weeks after this event, another storm impacted the Pacific coast of the United States; this storm, fueled by the \"Pineapple Express\", knocked out power to over one hundred thousand customers in the San Francisco Bay Area after producing strong winds. Hurricane-force winds were reported in parts of the northwestern United States. Regions reported as much as 9 inches (23\u00a0cm) of rainfall, and parts of the Sierra Nevada reported 19 inches (48\u00a0cm) of snowfall.[17] Due to a persistent stationary high-pressure pattern over the west coast that redirects the jet stream, it remained (and remains) in a wavy ideal configuration to bring warm air north over the western U.S. and cold air towards the south over the continental states, and to favor winter storms over the East Coast. Severe winter blizzards over New England are often associated with this configuration, and nearly all of the snow storms this season followed very similar tracks and had marked similarities in their synoptic evolution. Boston in particular saw the effects of this, experiencing six major snow storms in the first two months of the year, leaving it with over 105 inches (270\u00a0cm) of snow. January 27 saw first major snowfall of 2015, with observations showing a blocked flow with warm air over the west coast, accompanied by a pronounced cold trough downstream, which pattern looks very similar to the blizzard that Boston saw on January 23, 2005.[18] As a result, February was record-breaking for many cities in the United States, yet in opposite extremes. Much of February saw below-average cold in the eastern part of the country, it was markedly warm in the West. A multitude of cities east of the Mississippi experienced their coldest February in decades, including Chicago, Ill.; Cleveland, Oh.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Harrisburg, Pa.; Hartford, Conn.; and Portland, Maine. Marquette, Mich. Syracuse, Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y. also set records for coldest month overall,[19] as did Bangor, Maine where the average temperature was 6.1\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214.4\u00a0\u00b0C). And with an average temperature of 2.5\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221216.4\u00a0\u00b0C), the state of Maine itself also set a record low. For Worcester, Mass, February was the coldest month out of any month on record with an average temperature of just 14.2\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22129.9\u00a0\u00b0C), while also accumulating more than 110 inches (280\u00a0cm) of snow this winter. In contrast, in the West a persistently strong ridge of high pressure over the warm eastern Pacific Ocean and western North America elevated temperatures to record levels from Arizona to Washington. It was the warmest winter month (December, January, February) on record in San Francisco; Seattle; Portland, Ore.; Reno, Nev.; Las Vegas; and Salt Lake City, with the latter realizing an average temperature for February of 43.9\u00a0\u00b0F (6.6\u00a0\u00b0C), breaking the old record set in 1907. Meanwhile, just 1.1 inches (2.8\u00a0cm) of snow fell in the entire month in Anchorage, Alaska, making it the fifth-least-snowy February on record.[20] Portland and Salem had their warmest February on record, with the latter tying the record set in 1934 for their warmest at 45.9\u00a0\u00b0F (7.7\u00a0\u00b0C) degrees with the year. For the first time in record keeping, every day in February was at least 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C) in Salem.[21] California averaged 1.5\u00a0\u00b0F (0.83\u00a0\u00b0C) warmer than the previous warmest winter (2013\u201314), which had broken the previous record (1980\u201381) by 0.8\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221217.3\u00a0\u00b0C). February was the warmest on record in Washington, California, Utah and Arizona, while February was among the top 10 warmest in four other states. Overall, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that about 30.6 percent of the country was \"very warm\" \u2013 meaning February was in the warmest 10 percent of the historical record \u2013 while 31.5 percent of the country was \"very cold,\" or in the coldest 10 percent historically.[5]"

The new, more powerful cyclone entered the Bering Sea, and intensified to become the most powerful storm to ever impact the region, with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 millibars (27.3 inches of mercury). This compares to the previous record of 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg) from a storm on October 25, 1977. In association with the storm, there were winds exceeding hurricane-force with a wind gust of 97 miles per hour (156\u00a0km/h) recorded at Shemya, Alaska. The storm also produced waves as high as 45 feet (14\u00a0m), although waves were lesser on the Alaska coast.[22] The storm weakened as it moved westward, and it produced a \"ripple\" in the jet stream which allowed for a strong cold front to dive southward out of Canada into the United States, producing a cold wave.[1]"

Precipitation was at first relatively scattered, but as the day went on it began to blossom, reaching the Mid-Atlantic by the evening of February 21. There was more ice then snow in this system, and as a result, periods of freezing rain and sleet were expected in a swath extending from North Carolina to Long Island, with ice accumulations ranging from 0.1\u20130.5 inches (2.5\u201312.7\u00a0mm),[65] and snow accumulations of 5\u20138 inches (13\u201320\u00a0cm).[65] This system moved off the coast early on February 22. The second winter storm focused on the South and Southeast on February 25\u201326. A stationary front coalesced into an area of low pressure in the center of Louisiana, and moved to the east. Originally composed of all rain, snow began to break out on the northern side of the winter storm due to cold air beginning to penetrate into the Deep South. It consisted of wet snow, which would cause numerous power outages.[66] Heavy snowbands also began to set up, which was the result of heavy accumulations ranging from 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330\u00a0cm) in eastern North Carolina.[64] The winter storm also produced a small but potent line of thunderstorms in the Florida Peninsula, as such a tornado watch was issued. The system began to accelerate somewhat as it began to emerge off the Southeast coast early on February 26, as snow continued to fall into the southern parts of the Mid-Atlantic. The third in the series of winter storms happened from February 28 into late March 1, and spread a swath of snow and ice from the High Plains to New England.[67] The system organized from an upper-level impulse associated with a developing southward dip in the jet stream, which led to the formation of a weak area of low pressure. This weak disturbance began to develop a stripe of snow from the Midwest to the Ohio Valley, and it began to push into the Northeast as the sluggish winter storm tracked to the east. Snowfall was sometimes heavy at times, with snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour, but didn't last long. Freezing rain also began to develop in the Mid-Atlantic, setting the stage for more ice accumulations. As the snow moved to the east, warm air began to run over the cold air in place over the Mid-Atlantic, and snow changed over to a mix of freezing rain and sleet by evening on March 1 in areas near Maryland and southern New Jersey. Ice accumulations ranged from 0.1\u20130.4 inches (2.5\u201310.2\u00a0mm), and snow totals 5\u20138 inches (13\u201320\u00a0cm) in a swath from the Midwest near Illinois to southern New England. The entire wintry mess moved off by mid-morning on March 2.[68] The fourth and final winter storm came right on the heels of the previous system, and actually occurred in two phases, with the latter bringing record cold in its wake.[69] It occurred from March 3\u20135, and brought up to a foot of snow in the Northeast, while also causing multiple travel issues and/or delays.

In addition, 736 records for the highest snow depth were broken and 138 were tied during the same period.[73] Over a large portion of New England, February 2015 was the most extreme winter month observed in modern record keeping. Eastport, Maine was one of many places also seeing record snowfall, with 132.5 inches (337\u00a0cm) over five weeks. Snowflakes fell on 19 out of 28 days in the Boston, Massachusetts area, setting records in numerous locations with depths up to over 36.0 inches (91\u00a0cm) deep in certain places. Boston broke the previous record for the snowiest month by almost 24.0 inches (61\u00a0cm).[74] With a total of 108.6 inches (276\u00a0cm) as of March 16, Boston broke its previous all-time winter season (July 1 through June 30) record of 107.6 inches (273\u00a0cm) set in 1995\u201396.[75] Previously Boston saw a record 30-day snowfall of 94.4 inches (240\u00a0cm) from January 24 \u2013 February 22, 2015. Other broken records included four calendar days with at least 12.0 inches (30\u00a0cm) of snow, and the fastest 72.0 inches (183\u00a0cm) snowfall in 18 days from January 24 \u2013 February 10, 2015, and the fastest 90.0 inches (229\u00a0cm) snowfall during 23 days, from January 24 \u2013 February 15, 2015. Overall, Boston saw three of its top seven heaviest snowstorms in just over two years. Record cold temperatures were involved as Boston failed to reach 40\u00a0\u00b0F (4\u00a0\u00b0C) for 43 consecutive days, from January 20 through March 3.[citation needed] Boston also spent the second longest amount of time below freezing in the city records at 15 days.[76] Providence, Rhode Island saw its second snowiest season with 73.5 inches (187\u00a0cm), with February being their second all-time snowiest month with 31.8 inches (81\u00a0cm).[77] Boston, Massachusetts, received 99.4 inches (252\u00a0cm) of snow for the meteorological winter of 2014\u201315, which was 66.6 inches (169\u00a0cm) over the average, and broke the 1993\u201394 record of 81.5 inches (207\u00a0cm). Most of this snow was during February, which saw 64.8 inches (165\u00a0cm). For the year, Boston's record snow as of March 31 was 110.6 inches (281\u00a0cm).[citation needed] Despite Boston\u2019s record snow in February, however, this was still the 40th driest February in Massachusetts.[78] Baltimore (as measured at BWI), averaged below the freezing temperatures for first three months of 2015, making it the coldest start to any year there on record. January averaged 2.1\u00a0\u00b0F (1.2\u00a0\u00b0C) below normal, and February was the second-coldest on record, being 10.5\u00a0\u00b0F (5.8\u00a0\u00b0C) below normal, while March continued the chilly trend, finishing 3.9\u00a0\u00b0F (2.2\u00a0\u00b0C) below normal.[79] In February 2015, nine states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Vermont) had their second coldest February.[80] New York and Vermont had its coldest first quarter on record in 2015.[81]"

                "content": "The 1970s had been an exceptionally wet decade over eastern Australia,[1] despite short-term droughts from April to August 1976 and June to December 1977. 1978 was especially wet in the southern coast districts of New South Wales and East Gippsland because southern low pressure systems consistently redeveloped over the east coast. Orbost's 1978 rainfall of 1,559 millimetres (61.4\u00a0in) is as much as 256\u00a0mm (10\u00a0inches) above its previous record from 1935. In the winter, unseasonal rains struck normally bone-dry areas of northern Australia, and the wet season arrived early in the north in October. Though the Wet was not abnormally powerful in November and December, southeastern Australia remained exceptionally wet."

                "content": "The year 1979 began with extraordinarily hot conditions over southern Australia. Both livestock and wild animals perished in great numbers due to the heatwave, which saw places in northern South Australia regularly reach temperatures of at least 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F) from 31 December 1978 to 15 January 1979.[2] In Western Australia, the Nullarbor region settlements of Mundrabilla and Forrest both reached maxima of 49.8\u00a0\u00b0C (121.6\u00a0\u00b0F), the sixth-highest recorded temperatures in Australia, on 3 and 13 January 1979, respectively.[3] Temperatures reached 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) in Sydney and in that summer's Ashes Test match, Australia's wicket keeper retired from heat exhaustion.[4] Rain fell heavily in the Mallee later in the month, making it a record wet month in many parts of western Victoria and far western New South Wales. The southeast corner, however, was already very dry. February and March saw a continuing powerful monsoon, but except for the Mallee in February and the east coast from Newcastle to Triabunna in March, southeastern Australia was dry. April had fairly normal rainfall except for continuing wet in Cape York Peninsula and dry conditions around Sydney and Hobart, where rainfall deficiencies were already acute.[5] Heavy May rainfall over the wheat belt did not mask dry conditions around Canberra and especially in eastern Tasmania. June, however, proved the first really dry month: both Canberra and Hobart had their driest June ever, and Melbourne also set a record for low rainfall in July as cold fronts utterly failed to reach their normal latitudes. August and September, however, saw a series of tropical/extratropical interactions produce exceptional rainfall over most of Victoria, South Australia, western New South Wales and Tasmania. Flooding occurred in the Murray Basin and northern Tasmania. The coastal districts of New South Wales and southern Queensland, however, became extremely dry by September. Despite continuing heavy rains over south Australia, the Mallee and the Wimmera through spring, a dry November and near-record dry December ensured 1979 was the driest year until 2006 in Hobart and the driest since 1907 in Orbost. Further north, although an area of the Darling Downs had had heavy rainfall in October, the wet season was very late and had not set in by December."

                "content": "Heavy rains in East Gippsland in January proved a false forecast of what was to come, for in southeastern Australia February and March were exceptionally dry. Brisbane had its second-driest March on record, and apart from scattered areas the northern monsoon was modest. In the drier wheat country, many stations in the Mallee and adjacent parts of South Australia were completely rainless throughout the 1979/1980 summer, while the January rains that temporarily relieved the drought in East Gippsland did not reach Hobart. April began very warm and dry, but an extensive upper low followed by a vigorous cold front on the 22nd made this an extremely wet month in South Australia, far western New South Wales, western Victoria and northern Tasmania. However, in most of New South Wales this blocking high produced uninterrupted dry weather. At Canberra, it was the driest April on record, and a remarkable feature of the month was that the highest rainfalls in New South Wales occurred in the normally dry Western Division.[6] A cyclonic storm in May led to floods on the North Coast, but from June drought again set in over the eastern coastal belt between Bundaberg and Hobart. August and September were particularly dry. In these months Sydney received only 15 millimetres (0.6\u00a0in) and water restrictions were imposed on the city's residents. Elsewhere in eastern Australia the winter had near normal rainfall but was exceptionally warm, while September's dryness extended to every part of the mainland except alpine areas and the southern coastline, where the mild, wet weather was producing good conditions despite the burden of agisting cattle from drought-stricken areas. Although October was very wet in South Australia, western Victoria, and southern Queensland, drought-affected areas of New South Wales did not get significant rain until December, when hot, humid and unsettled weather brought some relief from the driest February to November period over the southeast corner since 1915. Nonetheless, in most of the Hunter Basin, including Newcastle, 1980 was the driest year ever recorded. In some stations on the South Coast it was the driest since 1888. The wet season had also been very late over the tropics."

                "content": "The hot, humid weather of December continued throughout summer. January saw the most active monsoon since 1974 over Queensland: Hughenden received 422 millimetres (16.6\u00a0in), or as much as 85 percent of its normal annual rainfall,[7] while in the Wet Tropics rainfall was extraordinarily heavy: Babinda received a remarkable 2,560 millimetres (100.8\u00a0in) for the month. February was also wet, with Brisbane reporting its best rains since March 1974.[8] In western Tasmania, however, unusually hot and dry conditions led to a very rare fire in the wet forests near Zeehan.[9] In New South Wales, January was dry, but February saw very heavy rains that temporarily broke the long drought. March and April were generally dry except for Tasmania and a belt of western New South Wales in March and the North Coast of New South Wales in April. April was also very hot. However, the May to August period was exceptionally wet over Victoria (except East Gippsland), inland New South Wales and South Australia. A constant flow of powerful lows made this period the wettest on record over Victoria, and the Murray Basin experienced major flooding in August. May\u2013normally a generally dry month\u2013was also very wet in inland Queensland, with Hughenden receiving 107 millimetres (4.2\u00a0in) against a median rainfall of 4 millimetres (0.16\u00a0in), while July\u2019s heavy southern rainfall also extended into that State. Although rainfall in the winter over the coastal belt was below normal, except on the South Coast of New South Wales February and May rains had already eliminated drought for the moment. However, except for November when Brisbane received a record total of 413 millimetres (16.3\u00a0in) and heavy rain extended as far south as inland Victoria, and useful rains over coastal New South Wales and Queensland in October and December, the last third of 1981 was very dry and hot. In the Western District of Victoria it was the driest such period since 1967, with some places having record low totals in both September and December."

                "content": "The year again began with extremely hot conditions in southern Australia: in Melbourne, the mean maximum for the weekends of January to March was a remarkable 29.3\u00a0\u00b0C (84.7\u00a0\u00b0F). Although February was exceptionally dry, rainfall for January and March was on the whole above average, with the northern inland of New South Wales having its wettest March since 1931 and dry conditions appearing relieved. April, however, saw dry conditions immediately return. Large falls late in the month over the settled areas of South Australia and a heavy cyclone over the Wet Tropics were not followed up. Though in May Tasmania and West Gippsland had good rainfall, most of New South Wales and Queensland except for the Brisbane area was already very dry. With the 1982\u201383 El Ni\u00f1o event developing from June, things steadily became much worse. Huge high-pressure systems over Australia ensured very limited rain and consistent severe frosts in June. The month was the driest on record over many inland areas of New South Wales. July was much worse still, for apart from coastal areas there was almost no rain and in many areas of the wheat belt frosts reached levels never seen since temperature records began. Despite scattered July rainfall in East Gippsland, August was even worse, for the dry conditions were accompanied by quite remarkable heat as the anticyclones this time pushed hot, dry air from central Australia, with the only significant rainfall being on the Wet Tropical coast where Innisfail and Babinda had over 500 millimetres (20\u00a0in). Late in the month temperatures reached 29.5\u00a0\u00b0C (85.1\u00a0\u00b0F) in Mildura and overall mean maxima inland were as much as 4\u00b0C (7\u00b0F) above normal, causing ripening of wheat crops that had failed to develop in the cold, dry weather of previous months. September saw useful rains over southwestern New South Wales, West Gippsland, and southeastern Tasmania, along with very heavy falls on the North Coast\u2013but no rain fell in the wheat districts where the drought was already developing into a record dry spell. October again saw heavy rain on the North Coast, but was very dry elsewhere, while November apart from western Tasmania and a small part of the Wet Tropics was very hot and almost rainless apart from thunderstorms mid-month. Bushfires broke out in East Gippsland and continued burning for several months. December saw some heavy thunderstorm rains in northeastern New South Wales and a single major rain event over the Port Phillip region and northeastern Tasmania, but extremely dry conditions continued elsewhere. For the nine months from April to December 1982, most of inland eastern Australia experienced its lowest rainfall on record, as did parts of the South Gippsland. In the North Wimmera district covering Victoria's best wheat areas, the 1982 rainfall for this period was less than half the previous record low. Many wheat crops failed completely for the first time in decades, and overall Victoria's yield was its lowest since 1944, while that of New South Wales was the lowest since 1957 and South Australia the lowest since 1977.[10][11]"

                "content": "Although the year began with cool conditions over southeastern Australia, the monsoon was extremely weak in the north. February saw a turn back towards very hot weather, with Melbourne having three days over 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) for only the second time on record. A huge dust storm carried away 50\u00a0million tonnes of the topsoil from the Mallee and Wimmera,[12] and then the Ash Wednesday bushfires ravaged the tinder-dry forests of southeastern Australia. More than 70\u00a0people were killed, while fires moved from Gippsland into the South Coast of New South Wales.[13] Late February saw scattered very heavy thunderstorms over New South Wales, but the month was close to the driest on record over Tasmania and Victoria and very dry again over the tropics. The beginning of March, however, saw torrential thunderstorms over the settled areas of South Australia, flooding areas that were fire-stricken only two weeks beforehand. Hot, humid weather continued throughout eastern Australia for the next three weeks as the monsoon suddenly became extremely powerful. On 21 March, a powerful monsoonal low moved southwards, drenching western New South Wales and the South Coast, and then western Victoria, Gippsland and Eastern Tasmania. At Tanybryn in the Otways, 375 millimetres (14.8\u00a0in) fell for the 24\u00a0hours ending 22 March, flooding the rebuilt Great Ocean Road. The month of March was the wettest since 1910 over most of the Mallee and Wimmera and since 1946 over the rest of western Victoria. Although the western slopes of New South Wales and most of eastern Queensland missed the heavy rains of March, both April and May were exceptionally wet over these regions as upper-level flows came in consistently from the north. The autumn of 1983 was the wettest over Queensland as a whole, and by May much of the Darling Downs was flooded. Steady, consistent rains for the rest of the year ensured a record wheat crop over most of Australia, with yields at levels that have never been equalled since.[11]"
