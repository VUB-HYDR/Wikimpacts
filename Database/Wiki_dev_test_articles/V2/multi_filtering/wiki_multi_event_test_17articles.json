The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1957 Pacific hurricane season.

Later that day, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h)[3] and a barometric pressure of 995 millibars (29.4\u00a0inHg).[4] Tropical Storm 01W maintained this intensity through January\u00a05 before abruptly weakening to a tropical depression near the eastern Philippines. The system made landfall in eastern Leyte early on January\u00a06 with winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) before dissipating the following day over Romblon.[3][4]"

Gradual intensification took place as the depression tracked westward.[4] The JTWC began monitoring the system as Tropical Storm Rose the following day,[2] with the first advisory on the storm placing maximum winds at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Rose maintained this intensity for roughly 24\u00a0hours before undergoing a brief period of rapid intensification, attaining winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) early on January\u00a023. For most of the day, the now Category\u00a02 typhoon, strengthened at a more modest rate before undergoing a second brief period of rapid intensification. At the end of the second strengthening phase, Rose had attained its peak intensity just below Category\u00a05 status, on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale, with winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h),[5] and a minimum pressure of 952 millibars (28.1\u00a0inHg).[4] Upon attaining this intensity, Rose became the most intense January typhoon on record, surpassing that of Super Typhoon Karen in 1948.[5][6] After attaining its peak intensity, Rose began to take a more northerly track and weakened. Late on January\u00a025, Rose rapidly weakened to a low-end typhoon and by January\u00a026, the system had further weakened to a tropical storm. The JTWC continued to monitor the weakening tropical storm until January\u00a027, by which time Rose had maximum winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[5] However, the JMA continued monitoring the remnants of Rose as it turned sharply eastward over open waters. During the afternoon of January\u00a028, the depression nearly stalled as it turned northward before accelerating and losing its identity south of Japan on January\u00a030.[4]"

Developing into a tropical storm several hours later, further development would occur as Wendy tracked northwestwards. As a result, around three days later, the system became a typhoon. Further intensification occurred, and around 15:00 UTC on July 14, Wendy peaked with sustained winds of 90 knots (100 mph) and a minimum pressure of 985 hPa. However, around that time, Wendy made its first landfall in Luzon, causing it to weaken into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon the next day. Although it temporarily reintensified, attaining a secondary peak with sustained winds of 80 knots (90 mph) around that time, it began rapidly weakening, making its final landfall in Guangdong, China as a high-end tropical storm. Once inland, Wendy rapidly weakened, dissipating on July 16.[8] Prior to striking the nation, the Hong Kong Observatory hoisted a No. 5 storm signal as Wendy was expected to strike the nation. This was later upgraded to a No. 6 storm signal when Wendy made its closest approach to Hong Kong. Two cruisers from the Royal Navy left the colony. Due to the typhoon's winds, American billionaire Nelson Rockefeller had to divert his plane to the colony.[9][10] Despite these preparations, Wendy's impacts in Hong Kong were severe. Striking the island with gusts of 95 knots (110 mph) and torrential rainfall, the typhoon killed sixteen and injured a further two hundred. These included two boys who were killed when their huts collapsed on them and another boy who was also killed when he drowned in the sea surrounding West Point. The roof and rear of four homes collapsed, blocking all of Stavely Street. The SS Tweed Breeze broke from its buoy and ran aground in Stonecutter's Island, while parts of Taipo Road became inaccessible due to collapsing.[11][12][13][14] Elsewhere, in the Philippines, Wendy brought flooding which killed at least seventy-six, most of them children, and made a further three hundred go missing.[15][16] This flooding also displaced around thirty thousand people and destroyed several towns. Damage there amounted to $2 million (1957 USD). Elsewhere, in China's Guangdong Province, over three hundred-thousand people were mobilized to gather crops and take safety precautions due to the storm. Offshore Guangdong Province, eight people died when their fishing boat sank due to Wendy. Additionally, estimates indicated that around a fifth of the unharvested rice in the province was destroyed. Although Wendy did bring some gale-force winds to Taiwan, no damage was reported there.[17][18]"

                "content": "On May 5\u20138, 1965, a significant tornado outbreak[nb 1][nb 2] affected much of the Central United States. For four consecutive days, tornado outbreaks produced at least three significant (F2+) tornadoes each day, and at least two violent (F4\u2013F5) tornadoes on three of the four days. The entire sequence generated 37 significant tornadoes, including at least nine violent tornadoes, one of which was rated F5. On May 5, two F4s struck Iowa, including a long-tracked tornado family that injured 11 people. On May 6, an outbreak of six strong tornadoes, four of them violent F4s, affected Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, and has been nicknamed \"The Longest Night\", killing 13 people and causing major damages\u2014at the time the most damaging single weather event in Minnesota history.[1][4] Three of the six tornadoes occurred on the ground simultaneously, and two of them hit the section of Minnesota State Highway 100 (now Interstate 694) and University Avenue in the city of Fridley.[5] Both Fridley tornadoes damaged 1,100 homes and destroyed about 425; total losses reached $14.5 million, $5 million of which was to the Fridley school system. On May 7, three significant tornadoes hit portions of the Upper Midwest, and beginning early on May 8, a major tornado outbreak affected the Great Plains states, particularly in Nebraska and South Dakota. The outbreak on May 8 produced numerous significant, long-lived tornadoes, including at least three violent tornadoes, two of which were actually long-tracked tornado families. A very large F5 tornado struck Tripp County in South Dakota, and two major F4s tracked across parts of Greeley and Antelope Counties in Nebraska. One of the F4s struck the small village of Primrose, almost totally destroying the settlement, causing probable F5 damage, and killing four people. Additionally, a high-end F3 obliterated a farm in Gregory County, South Dakota, and may have been an F4 as well. Many of the individual tornadoes on May 8 moved north and northwest, an unusual trajectory for supercells in this part of the Great Plains. Many of the long-tracked tornadoes on this date, rather than single tornadoes, were probably tornado families like the two long-lived F4s."

These storms formed as training supercells\u2014an atmospheric phenomenon that is extremely rare in Minnesota. Because of the training, the same general areas from Sibley County through Carver and Hennepin and into northwestern Ramsey counties kept getting the brunt of these cells.[1]"

Over 450 homes were destroyed in Fridley, and neighboring Mounds View also sustained heavy damage. A man who called WCCO radio after the first Fridley tornado claimed on air that he had been in his car when the tornado hit and that the tornado blew out his car windows. Although he is widely believed to have been killed by the second Fridley twister later that night (which did kill a 26-year-old man with a similar name), the caller was actually a teacher at Fridley Junior High School who survived. The tornado also damaged the sign adorning the Heights Theater in Columbia Heights. In all, both Fridley tornadoes damaged 1,100 homes and destroyed about 425; total losses reached $14.5 million, $5 million of which was to the Fridley school system.[2][6] Photographs for the earlier Deephaven and second Fridley tornado were published in the Minneapolis Tribune (now Star Tribune) newspaper. Early radar images showed the supercells as they moved through the area.[2]"

The tornado reached one thousand seven hundred and sixty yards (1.00\u00a0mi), or one thousand six hundred and ten metres (1.61\u00a0km) in width and would destroy seven farms with three being swept clean at F5 intensity, only leaving empty basements behind. A car was thrown and was badly damaged, another car would be flipped on its back, and entire planks would be embedded into the ground. Fortunately, the tornado resulted in no deaths, but there was an injury. In all, the Colome, SD F5 was on the ground for 30.10 miles (48.44 kilometers) and would become the strongest-rated tornado of the outbreak and the strongest tornado in South Dakota state history."

                "content": " The 2021\u201322 North American winter was not as significant and record-breaking as the previous winter season. Despite this, several notable and significant events still occurred, including two separate record-breaking tornado outbreaks in mid-December, a significant winter storm in the South in mid-January, a powerful blizzard that impacted the Northeast coast at the end of January and a wide-ranging, significant winter storm that affected most of the eastern half of the country in early February. Additional significant events included a late-season winter storm in March that affected the Appalachian Mountains, and a major blizzard that affected North and South Dakota in mid-April. Additionally, a very late out-of-season snowstorm struck the Rocky Mountains in late May. During the season, four storms have been ranked on the Regional Snowfall Index (RSI), although none attained the \u201cMajor\u201d category. Similar to the previous winter, a developing La Ni\u00f1a was expected to influence weather patterns across the continent. Based on the astronomical definition, winter began on the winter solstice on December\u00a021, 2021 and ended on the spring equinox on March\u00a020, 2022.[1] Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter started on December\u00a01 and the last day was February\u00a028.[2] These dates historically describe the period in each year when winter storms are most likely to occur. However, winter storms may occur outside of these limits, as shown by the early formation of this season's mid-October winter storm on October\u00a012. Since both definitions of winter span the start of the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm spanning two different years. In addition, major winter events can occur well after the official start of spring, as close as June in some cases, as shown by a very late-season winter storm that impacted Colorado in late May 2022 with heavy snow following warm temperatures just a day beforehand."

Overall for the winter, significantly above-average temperatures were forecast for most of the Southern Tier, with near-average temperatures in the Central and much of the Northeastern United States. Slightly below-average temperatures were expected in most of the north-central and northwestern U.S. During the first half of the season, a relatively weak La Ni\u00f1a was expected to result in widespread below-average temperatures across the northern half of the country, with widespread above-average temperatures in the southern half. However, as both the La Ni\u00f1a and polar vortex were expected to strengthen later in the season, widespread above-average temperatures were forecast in most of the U.S. during the latter half of the winter, especially in the South and East. Below-average temperatures were still expected to continue in the far Northwestern U.S.[3] On October 21, 2021, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center released its U.S. Winter Outlook for the upcoming winter.[4] The temperature and precipitation outlooks reflected a typical La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern during the winter. Significantly above-average temperatures were forecasted across the Southern Tier, especially in the Southeast, with slightly above-average temperatures forecast in the Ohio Valley and Northeast. Near to below-average temperatures were expected in the far northwestern U.S. Below-average precipitation was expected across the far Southern Tier, with particularly in the Southwest, with above-average precipitation forecast in the far Northwestwern U.S., as well as the Ohio Valley and surrounding regions. Near-average precipitation was expected in the Central U.S., Northern Plains, and Northeast. Drought was forecasted to improve and end in the Pacific Northwest, while it was expected to develop or worsen across the Southwest. Drought was not expected in the eastern half of the country.[4]"

                "content": "The 2021\u201322 winter season began with the formation of a significant winter storm in the Western United States on October\u00a012, resulting in heavy snow accumulations of up to 28\u00a0in (71\u00a0cm) across much of the Intermountain West and over 80 rescues due to blizzard-like conditions in Utah.[5][6] The system was estimated to have caused at least $50 million in damages.[7] After a one-month break in winter weather events due to unfavorable conditions for winter storms, a blizzard began to develop across south-central Canada and the Upper Midwest on November 11.[8] December 2021 saw a record warm month across the Lower 48. Ten states (New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska) saw record warm December's.[9] An early December heat wave set all-time record highs in Montana, Washington, Wyoming, and North Dakota. Parts of British Columbia saw temperatures of 22.5\u00a0\u00b0C (72.5\u00a0\u00b0F), tying it for an all time Canadian high in December.[10] In early-to-mid December, a major system produced a historic tornado outbreak along with wintry weather in the Upper Midwest, followed by another powerful storm that produced an ever larger tornado outbreak along with strong winds across the High Plains just a few days later. The storm, being a category 3 atmospheric river event,[11] brought heavy rain and snowfall to the Western United States. Over 8 inches (20\u00a0cm) of rain during the storm were recorded on Mount Tamalpais, a mountain in the San Francisco Bay Area, with San Francisco itself receiving around two inches of rain from the event.[12] Around 60 inches (150\u00a0cm) of snow was recorded in Pinecrest, California.[12] The storm caused statewide snowpack in California to increase from 19% of normal to 83% of normal.[13] Later that month and into early January, a series of winter storms brought a cold snap and heavy snowfall to parts of the West Coast, particularly areas in the Pacific Northwest region.[14] Several weather stations in Washington state recorded record-breaking low temperatures for December 26 and 27, with temperatures at 17\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22128\u00a0\u00b0C) in Seattle and 7\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214\u00a0\u00b0C) in Bellingham.[15] This became Seattle's coldest day in 31 years, because the high for the day was only 23\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22125\u00a0\u00b0C).[16] Seattle recorded 9.2 inches (23\u00a0cm) of snow in December, exceeding the city's normal winter average,[17] while some parts of the region had more than 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m).[18] With five days of snow in a row, Seattle saw the most consecutive snowy days on record since 1969.[19] Another storm on January 6 led to the closure of several mountain passes in the Cascade Range, leaving only one east\u2013west route across Washington. Snoqualmie Pass reopened to limited traffic four days later.[20][21] In Vancouver, British Columbia, the temperature dropped to \u221215.3\u00a0\u00b0C (4.5\u00a0\u00b0F) on December 27, the coldest temperature there since 1969.[22] Before additional snow events occurred throughout January, with below-average temperatures being common, Falcon Lake, Texas, set a record\nfor the highest January temperature in the contiguous United States on January 1, at 99.0\u00a0\u00b0F (37.2\u00a0\u00b0C).[23] One such storm in January was the a significant winter storm in the eastern half of the country in mid-January with snow and ice,[24] causing Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina to all declare a state of emergency in preparation for the winter storm.[25] The most significant event occurred at the end of the month, when a major blizzard struck the Northeastern United States on January 28\u201329. This storm brought up to 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6\u00a0cm) across a swath of New England and caused widespread impacts. Blizzard conditions were confirmed at multiple locations in New England, including Providence, Boston, and Worcester,[26] in addition to some areas on the Jersey Shore receiving blizzard conditions. In early February, another major winter storm affected the country, with areas as far south as Texas to as far north as Maine receiving significant snowfall, though in the former it was not as bad as the previous year's storm which crippled the state's power grid.[27] Howard Pass, Alaska saw a wind chill of \u221291\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221268\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 7.[28] The rest of February saw less significant wintry events aside from a few concentrated snowstorms in some areas, particularly the Northeast, but activity increased again in mid-March after a significant winter storm affected a wide swath of areas from Louisiana to Maine, dropping widespread snow amounts of 6\u201318 inches (15\u201346\u00a0cm).[29] After a few late-season cold snaps, a a major blizzard struck the Dakotas in mid-April, dropping as much as 40 inches (100\u00a0cm) of snow, unusual for so late in the season.[30] The last significant event occurred in late May after a record-late snowstorm struck Colorado just days after temperatures had been near 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C).[31] However, on June 19, 2022, a hiker died due to hypothermia in Maine, and temperatures below freezing were recorded that morning in Canaan Valley in West Virginia, Mount Washington in New Hampshire, and Waverly, New York.[32] Caribou, Maine, saw their latest day where the high failed to reach 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C), with highs of 49\u00a0\u00b0F (9\u00a0\u00b0C).[33]"

The system then merged into a well-formed extratropical cyclone with a single-low pressure center by early the next day, beginning to steadily intensify.[37] Snowfall rates began to rapidly increase in bands to the west of the center throughout the day, with up to a foot of snow falling within hours. The system reached its peak intensity of 988\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg) at 21:00 UTC on October\u00a013.[38][39] The extratropical cyclone then began to accelerate to the north, becoming occluded in the process.[40][5] The weakening system then moved into the Canadian Prairies, resulting in some more snow there,[41] before merging into another frontal system on October\u00a015.[42] The precursor to the system resulted in blizzard conditions across parts of northeastern Utah on October 11, disrupting a 50-mile ultramarathon occurring there. Extremely heavy snowfall rates and winds gusting to tropical storm-force resulted in the race being called off, and over 87 rescues had to be made in the snow.[6] The next day, up to 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) of snow fell across mountainous areas of Colorado as the system was organizing.[43] The system also resulted in wind gusts of over 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) in parts of Nevada that day.[44] On October\u00a013, the system moved north into areas such as Wyoming, with 17.4 inches (44\u00a0cm) of snow falling in Casper, and even higher totals in the high elevations.[45] Additionally, hurricane-force wind gusts were recorded across parts of eastern Colorado and western South Dakota, with a 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) gust occurring in Wasta. As the storm system reached peak intensity on October 14, heavy snowfall rates resulted in snowfall totals of over 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) in parts of eastern Montana, with the storm's maximum snowfall total of 28 inches (71\u00a0cm) occurring in Pony. Larger cities such as Billings and Bozeman also saw 8\u201312 inches (20\u201330\u00a0cm) of snow from the system. Areas in the Black Hills such as Deadwood and Whitewood measured over 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) of snow, with Rapid City also recording 3 inches (7.6\u00a0cm).[5] As the system moved into south-central Canada later that day, it also resulted in some light snowfall there before the system dissipated the next day.[46] According to Aon Benfield, the system was estimated to have caused at least $50 million (2021 USD) in damages.[7]"

The bomb cyclone had a minimum central pressure of 942 millibars (27.8\u00a0inHg) at its peak, making it the most powerful cyclone recorded in the Northeast Pacific.[49] The system had severe impacts across Western North America, before dissipating on October 26. The storm shattered multiple pressure records across parts of the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, the bomb cyclone was the most powerful storm on record to strike the region, in terms of minimum central pressure. The bomb cyclone brought powerful gale-force winds and flooding to portions of Western North America. At its height, the storm cut the power to over 370,500 customers across the Western U.S. and British Columbia.[citation needed] The storm killed at least two people;[50] damage from the storm was estimated at four hundred million dollars (2021 USD).[47] The bomb cyclone was compared to the Columbus Day Storm of 1962, in terms of ferocity.[51]"

In southern Wyoming and Colorado, the storm dropped a maximum total of 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) of snow in the mountains.[54] In Minnesota, some towns and cities received over one foot (30\u00a0cm) of snow. The Twin Cities received a maximum total of 21 inches (53\u00a0cm) of snow, making the winter storm the heaviest snowstorm recorded in the area since another blizzard in April 2018.[52] Minneapolis and St. Paul each declared snow emergencies. In the Twin Cities, Metro Transit reported that half of its busses were delayed. More than 250 flights were canceled at Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport. Near Faribault, a seven-car pileup occurred on Interstate 35. Minnesota State Patrol reported 232 crashes, causing 19 injuries.[55] The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for part of Minnesota during the December 10.[56]"

A shortwave trough moved through the area, dumping up to 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) of snow in the state.[31] Some areas even received their heaviest snowfall for the month of May as a result, although Denver did not see a record-breaking amount. The winter storm followed on the heels of a large temperature drop throughout the state, following temperatures of near 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) the day before, with some areas like Denver seeing a 50\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) drop in that timeframe.[31] In Denver, as the front came through, the temperature dropped from 85\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C), to 59\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C), in 23 minutes.[217] The highest accumulations in Colorado were 11.4 inches (29\u00a0cm), while it was 11 inches (28\u00a0cm) in Montana.[218] The winter storm caused 100,000 customers to lose power.[219] In addition, over 600 flights were delayed and over 300 more were cancelled.[220] The low on May 21 in Denver was a record tying 31\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121\u00a0\u00b0C).[31] While Wyoming did not see as much snow, several locations saw record low temperatures on May 21, and with a low of 26\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22123\u00a0\u00b0C) on May 22, Cheyenne also set a record low that day, although Cheyenne missed a record low on May 21.

In Hingham, a large tree brought down wires.[227] According to Aon Benfield, damage was estimated at over $200 million (2021 USD).[230] The system would later move out to sea and acquire subtropical characteristics, becoming Subtropical Storm Wanda on October 31, later becoming a full-fledged tropical cyclone two days later. The precursor of Wanda caused a lot of flooding in the tri-state area with heavy amounts of rain, which killed two people. [citation needed]"

                "content": " The 1995\u201396 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was a moderately active season that included Cyclone Bonita, which was the first known tropical cyclone to cross from the southern Indian Ocean into the southern Atlantic Ocean. Tropical activity lasted for about six months from the middle of November 1995 to early May 1996. The first storm, Intense Tropical Cyclone Agnielle, formed in the adjacent Australian basin on November\u00a016 and later reached peak winds in the south-west Indian Ocean. The next named storm after Agnielle was Bonita, which formed in early January and killed 42\u00a0people. The basin was most active in February, with two tropical cyclones, or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, as well as a severe tropical storm. The first of these three was Doloresse, which killed 67\u00a0people due to a shipwreck in the Comoros. The next storm was Cyclone Edwige, which caused heavy crop damage on Mauritius before looping along the east coast of Madagascar. In March, both Cyclone Flossy and Tropical Storm Guylianne passed near the Mascarene Islands, producing heavy rainfall and gusty winds. Tropical activity continued through April and May, with two tropical cyclones in the former month. In early April, Tropical Cyclone Hansella moved over the island of Rodrigues, dropping more rainfall in 24\u00a0hours than the average monthly total. Later, Itelle became a rare April intense tropical cyclone, but weakened before it approached St. Brandon island. The final storm of the season, Jenna, formed in the Australian region, briefly intensified into a minimal tropical storm in the south-west Indian Ocean, and proceeded to exit the basin on May\u00a04 to end the season. In addition to the named storms, several tropical depressions were tracked, one of which in December dropped heavy rainfall on R\u00e9union."

                "content": "During the season, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office (MFR) on R\u00e9union island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin. The agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique,[1] and warned on tropical cyclones in the region from the coast of Africa to 90\u00b0\u00a0E, south of the equator.[2] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy\u00a0\u2013 United States Air Force task force, also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the southwestern Indian Ocean.[3] The season was fairly active with ten tropical storms, one greater than average, although most storms were short-lived. Six of the storms reached tropical cyclone status, or maximum sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), which is two more than average. Most cyclones dissipated within the tropics, in contrast to the norm of storms accelerating into higher latitudes. Throughout the season there were 82\u00a0days in which there was tropical activity.[1] Based on a list contributed by the nation of Seychelles, the storms were named in sequential order, starting with Agnielle. The rest of the names on the list were Ketty, Lucia, Molly, Nadege, Odette, Paquerette, Rolina, Sylvianne, Talla, Vivienne, Walya, and Yoline.[4] In addition to the named storms, the MFR tracked 11\u00a0tropical depressions or disturbances that did not intensify into a tropical storm. The agency did not issue any bulletins on eight of them. Of the remaining three, two formed in late December, and the other formed in mid-February. Tropical Depression B2, the longest lasting of the depressions, formed after a month of activity. An area of convection developed in the Mozambique Channel, and the MFR believed it to be connected to the depression that formed on December\u00a028 east of Madagascar. With a ridge to the east, the system tracked southward, but failed to intensify due to strong wind shear. While passing west of R\u00e9union, the depression dropped heavy rainfall, totaling 350\u00a0mm (14\u00a0in) along the northern coast and about twice that amount in the mountainous interior. On December\u00a031, the depression dissipated to the southwest of R\u00e9union.[1] On February\u00a010, the JTWC tracked Tropical Cyclone 12S into the basin as a weakening tropical depression, which quickly dissipated.[3][5] A few days later, the JTWC also tracked Tropical Cyclone 15S from February\u00a014\u201317, which briefly intensified into a minimal tropical storm in the eastern portion of the basin.[3][6]"

It gradually intensified while moving southward, before turning sharply westward on November\u00a018 due to a ridge to the south. That day, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) office in Perth upgraded the low to Tropical Cyclone Daryl, or to minimal tropical storm status.[7] Designated Tropical Cyclone 01S by the JTWC,[3] Daryl continued to intensify, and the BoM upgraded it to winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[7] The system crossed into the basin on November\u00a019, and was renamed Daryl as Agnielle at that time.[1] On November\u00a020, the ridge to the south weakened, allowing Agnielle to turn to the southwest.[1] A well-defined eye developed, which persisted for about three days.[7] Late on November\u00a020, Agnielle attained peak 10\u2011minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph),[8] making it an intense tropical cyclone, a rarity for November storms.[1] On November\u00a021, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u2011minute winds of 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph), the second-strongest storm estimated by the agency in the Indian Ocean, after only Cyclone Fantala.[3] Although the eye briefly became less organized, accompanied by a decrease in winds, Agnielle re-intensified despite moving over colder waters. The ridge to the south rebuilt, forcing the cyclone to slow and turn to the west. Increasing wind shear caused rapid weakening; within 30\u00a0hours, the winds decreased from tropical cyclone to tropical depression status on November\u00a025. That day, the JTWC discontinued advisories, although the MFR continued tracking the circulation until Agnielle's dissipation on November\u00a027.[1][8]"

It moved southwestward, initially without development, but conditions gradually became more favorable. On January\u00a05, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonita, and three days later reached tropical cyclone status as it developed a well-defined eye. Later that day, Bonita quickly intensified to its 10\u2011minute peak intensity of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), making it the strongest storm of the season. A ridge to the south turned the cyclone more to the west. On January\u00a09, the JTWC estimated Bonita attained peak 1\u2011minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), and the next day, the cyclone made landfall about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) north of Foulpointe in eastern Madagascar. Bonita quickly weakened into a tropical storm while crossing the country but re-intensified slightly after reaching the Mozambique Channel on January\u00a012. Late on January\u00a013, Bonita made a second landfall in eastern Mozambique between Pebane and Quelimane.[1][9] Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories on January\u00a015, the remnants of Bonita continued across Africa, and emerging into the southern Atlantic Ocean on January\u00a019 and dissipating the next day. Bonita was considered by the Zambia Meteorological Department to have been the first tropical cyclone known to have traversed southern Africa from the South-West Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic.[10] In eastern Madagascar, 24\u2011hour rainfall totals included 170\u00a0mm (6.7\u00a0in) at Toamasina, while gusts exceeded 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) on the offshore island of \u00cele Sainte-Marie.[1] Bonita caused widespread flooding of rice crops,[11] as well as heavy infrastructure and crop damage along the northeastern coastline.[12] The cyclone killed 25\u00a0people in Madagascar and left 5,000\u00a0people homeless.[1] In Mozambique, Bonita dropped heavy rainfall and produced flooding, killing as many as 17\u00a0people. Floodwaters destroyed 2,500\u00a0ha (6,200 acres) of crops and demolished many buildings, including about 12 schools.[13][14] The remnants of Bonita dropped the heaviest rainfall in 80\u00a0years in eastern Zimbabwe,[15] and heavy rainfall also spread into Zambia.[10]"

It quickly intensified to reach peak 10\u2011minutes winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) on January\u00a09 to the north of the Cocos Islands, but later that day began weakening due to increasing wind shear.[16] At around 1800\u00a0UTC on January\u00a09, Hubert crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean with 10\u2011minute winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph),[17] and at that time, was renamed the cyclone Coryna. The wind shear quickly tore the convection away from the center, leaving the circulation exposed by January\u00a010. The next day, Coryna weakened to tropical depression status, and on January\u00a012 the circulation dissipated in the central Indian Ocean.[1][17]"

It moved slowly to the southwest with a well-defined center and a broad area of convection. For several days, the system remained weak until reaching more favorable conditions on February\u00a016, and the next day it intensified into Tropical Storm Doloresse. The storm slowed while reaching the western extent of a ridge, drifting for nearly 24\u00a0hours about 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Grande Comore. On February\u00a017, an approaching trough turned Doloresse to the south-southeast, bringing the storm about 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) southwest of Grande Comore; this made it the first cyclone to directly affect the nation since Cyclone Elinah 13\u00a0years prior. On February\u00a017, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u2011minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), and on the next day, the MFR estimated peak 10\u2011minute winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). Increasing shear caused Doloresse to rapidly weaken to tropical depression status on February\u00a019. Although the JTWC assessed the storm as continuing to the southeast and striking northwestern Madagascar, the MFR estimated the system turned to a southwest drift and dissipated on February\u00a020.[1][18] In the Comoros, Doloresse produced strong wind gusts, damaging crops and houses on Grande Comore.[1] Heavy rainfall caused landslides, and the cyclone caused a shipwreck, killing 67\u00a0people on the island of Moh\u00e9li.[19] The western periphery of the circulation dropped heavy rainfall in Tanzania.[1]"

A trough steered the new system to the southeast, but also prevented significant strengthening due to wind shear.[1] Late on February\u00a021, the MFR upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Edwige,[20] and the next day the JTWC began tracking it as Tropical Cyclone 16S.[3] When the trough weakened, Edwige turned to the south and later southwest,[1] reaching an initial peak of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) on February\u00a023.[20] That day, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken to minimal tropical storm status,[1] and the JTWC briefly discontinued advisories on February\u00a024. The strengthening ridge caused Edwige to accelerate to the west, bringing it south of Rodrigues without any effects on February\u00a024. On the next day, the storm passed north of Mauritius and R\u00e9union, where it produced wind gusts of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), respectively,[1] as well as heavy rainfall.[21] Due to crop damage caused by Edwige, as well as a drought later in the year, Mauritius failed to reach its quota for sugar outputs.[22] After passing north of R\u00e9union, Edwige began reintensifying due to decreasing wind shear,[1] and the JTWC reissued advisories on February\u00a025.[3] With warm waters, the storm developed increasing outflow as well as an eye.[1] On February\u00a026, Edwige intensified into a tropical cyclone and reached peak 10\u2011minute winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) while approaching eastern Madagascar. On the same day, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u2011minute winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[20] For unknown reasons, Edwige executed a counterclockwise loop along the Malagasy coast near Mananjary. Due to land interaction, the cyclone rapidly weakened and turned to the north-northeast off the coast,[1] although the JTWC assessed the storm as turning inland again.[20] On February\u00a029, Edwige dissipated just off the coast of Toamasina.

                "content": " The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was a record-breaking, devastating and deadly Atlantic hurricane season. It is the second-costliest hurricane season, just behind the 2017 season. It featured 28\u00a0tropical and subtropical storms,[1] which was the most recorded in a hurricane season until the 2020 season. The United States National Hurricane Center[nb 1] named 27\u00a0storms, exhausting the annual pre-designated list, requiring the use of six Greek letter names, and adding an additional unnamed subtropical storm during a post-season re-analysis. A record 15\u00a0storms attained hurricane status, with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour (119\u00a0km/h). Of those, a record seven became major hurricanes, rated Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Four storms of this season became Category\u00a05 hurricanes, the most of any season on record. The four Category\u00a05 hurricanes during the season were: Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. In July, Emily reached peak intensity in the Caribbean Sea, becoming the first Category\u00a05 hurricane of the season, later weakening and striking Mexico twice. It was the first Category 5 hurricane recorded in the month of July and was the earliest-forming Category 5 hurricane on record, until Hurricane Beryl surpassed the record in July 2024. In August, Katrina reached peak winds in the Gulf of Mexico but weakened by the time it struck the U.S. states of Louisiana and Mississippi. The most devastating effects of the season were felt on the Gulf Coast of the United States, where Katrina's storm surge crippled New Orleans, Louisiana, for weeks and devastated the Mississippi coastline. Katrina became the costliest U.S. hurricane, leaving $125\u00a0billion in damage[nb 2] and 1,392\u00a0deaths. Rita followed in September, reaching peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico before weakening and hitting near the border of Texas and Louisiana. The season's strongest hurricane, Wilma, became the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record, as measured by barometric pressure. Lasting for ten days in October, Wilma moved over Cozumel, the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and Florida, causing over $22\u00a0billion in damage and 52\u00a0deaths. The season's impact was widespread and catastrophic. Its storms caused an estimated 3,468\u00a0deaths and approximately $171.7\u00a0billion in damage. It was the costliest season on record at the time, until its record was surpassed 12 years later.

The fourth named storm developed at a then-record early date, surpassed in 2012. The fifth though eleventh and the thirteenth and onward named storms developed at then-record early dates that were later surpassed in 2020.[17] Further, the months of July and November set records for number of named storms, with 5 and 3, respectively. The 2005 season featured 15\u00a0hurricanes, surpassing the previous record of 12, set in 1969.\nOf the 15\u00a0hurricanes, 5\u00a0formed in September, with the season becoming only the sixth to feature 5 in that month.[17] The 2005 season also featured a record seven major hurricanes, one more than the previous record, set in 1926, 1933, 1950, 1996, and 2004. The four Category\u00a05 hurricanes were also a record.[15][18] The season's activity was reflected with an ACE rating of 250, the second-highest value on record in the Atlantic basin, after the 1933 season.[19][20] The extremely active 2005 hurricane season was a continuation of an extended sequence of active years for tropical activity in the Atlantic.[21] Tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic Ocean between 1995 and 2004 was more active than any other decade in reliable record. With the exception of two years in which El Ni\u00f1o conditions were prevalent (1997 and 2002), all hurricane seasons were individually above average. This was associated with an active phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), with a similar period of elevated tropical activity occurring between 1950 and 1969. The anomalously frequent formation of tropical storms and hurricanes reflected the emergence of unusually warm sea surface temperatures across the tropical Atlantic.[22] The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) predicted in May\u00a02005 that the conditions associated with this active multi-decadal signal would continue into the 2005 hurricane season, providing favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis in the tropical Atlantic.[23]"

                "header": "Record activity",
                "content": "Chylek and Lesins (2008) determined that the likelihood of a season generating as much tropical activity as 2005 was less than 1\u00a0percent. The consecutive occurrence of hurricane seasons as active as 2004 and 2005 in the Atlantic was unprecedented.[24] While environmental conditions favorable for the development of tropical cyclones were analogous to other active seasons, they were more pronounced and encompassed larger areas in 2005. The CPC determined that this environmental enhancement was primarily driven by four factors: the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, the reduction of atmospheric convection in the tropical Pacific, record-high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean, and conducive wind and pressure patterns across the western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The multidecadal oscillation increased the potency of conducive environmental factors for tropical development, including the increased strength of subtropical ridges in the northern and southern Atlantic and the eastern Pacific. This amplified the African easterly jet and enhanced upper-level easterlies, attenuating wind shear detrimental to tropical cyclogenesis across the central tropical Atlantic and the Caribbean. Frequent lulls in convection over the tropical Pacific also contributed to the strength of these ridges, focusing hurricane activity in the Atlantic. Most of the tropical storms and all major hurricanes in the Atlantic in 2005 formed when a lack of convection was present near the International Dateline, while a brief uptick in storms near the International Dateline led to a lull in tropical cyclogenesis in the Atlantic for the first half of August.[25] The Gulf of Mexico saw record levels of tropical activity in 2005, with 11\u00a0named storms entering the basin. The unusual activity was attributed to a persistent high pressure area over the Southeastern United States, the northeastward displacement and amplification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the eastern Pacific, and above average sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. These factors reduced vertical wind shear and favored cyclonic flow, creating an environment highly supportive of tropical development. The high pressure area also steered incoming storms into the Gulf of Mexico.[25] In addition, the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was in a neutral phase, lowering the likelihood of storms making landfall on the East Coast of the United States and leading to a concentration of impacts farther west.[21] This focusing mechanism led to a complementary reduction in storms developing close to Cape Verde.[26] During the peak of the 2005 season, the Loop Current\u00a0\u2013 an ocean current that transports warm water from the Caribbean Sea northward into the Gulf of Mexico and offshore the U.S. East Coast\u00a0\u2013 propagated northward, reaching its most poleward point in advance of Hurricane Katrina. This protrusion detached into a warm core ring, or a small region of warm waters to an abnormally deep depth, and began to drift southwest as Hurricane Rita traversed the region. By mid-October, the Loop Current returned to its typical position in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. This evolution provided enhanced ocean heat content to both hurricanes and was partially responsible for the extreme intensities attained by those cyclones.[27] In addition to the unusually high amount of tropical activity, the 2005\u00a0season also featured an abnormally high amount of storms in the typically inactive early and latter parts of the season.[28] Lowered sea-level atmospheric pressures in the late spring and early summer of 2005 curtailed the strength of trade winds, resulting in a reduction of latent heat loss from the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean. This allowed the persistence of the anomalously warm sea surface temperatures that had contributed to the active 2004 hurricane season; this warmth remained until November\u00a02005.[29] The activity in later parts of the 2005\u00a0season was elevated by the unusual development of four tropical cyclones from non-tropical origins over the eastern Atlantic.[30] In the wake of the season, questions arose regarding the potential impact of global warming on Atlantic hurricane activity. Hurricane experts noted that establishing a conclusive relationship would be difficult given the significant role that natural variability plays on hurricane formation and significantly improved tropical cyclone detection methods compared to decades past. A series of international workshops were established after 2005. After five years of analysis, researchers were unable to confirm whether the recent increase in tropical cyclone activity could be attributed more to climate change than natural variability. Models developed within the workshops projected that the number of tropical cyclones under Category\u00a03 intensity would fall over the 21st century, while the number of intense Category\u00a04\u20135 hurricanes would increase significantly. One potential hypothesis for these findings was a projected increase in vertical wind shear contradicted by warmer ocean temperatures for hurricanes to utilize. The team also concluded that the amount of precipitation produced by tropical cyclones would increase over the next century.[31] In May\u00a02020, researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Wisconsin at Madison built upon this research and, for the first time, established a statistically significant global trend toward more intense tropical cyclones, particularly in the Atlantic basin. The research not only reaffirmed a trend toward stronger, wetter tropical cyclones, but it also identified a trend toward increased rapid intensification events and a general slowing of tropical cyclones' forward motion near land.[32]"

The hurricane re-flooded New Orleans (though to a far less degree than Katrina), and caused about $18.5\u00a0billion in damage.[38] Wilma caused about $19\u00a0billion in damage when it moved across southern Florida in October. The hurricane contributed to 30\u00a0deaths, five of whom were killed directly by the storm.[39][40] Three hurricanes struck Mexico \u2013 Emily, Stan, and Wilma.

Stan was part of a broader weather system across Central America that killed 1,513\u00a0people in Guatemala, where damage was estimated at US$996\u00a0million.[43][44][42][45] Wilma dropped historic rainfall while drifting across the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.[46] It killed four people in the country and left US$454\u00a0million ($4.8\u00a0billion MXN) in damage.[47][42] In the Caribbean, Cuba suffered the effects of Dennis and Wilma. The former killed 16\u00a0people and left US$1.4\u00a0billion in damage when it struck Cuba twice.[48] Later, Wilma flooded parts of western Cuba, leaving US$704\u00a0million in damage.[48] The island of Hispaniola experienced Dennis in July, which killed 56\u00a0people in Haiti.[49] Emily killed one person and left US$111\u00a0million in damage when it struck Grenada,[50] and later it killed five people on Jamaica.[41] Collectively, Dennis and Emily caused about US$96\u00a0million (J$6\u00a0billion) in damage to Jamaica.[51] Wilma killed 12\u00a0people in Haiti and one in Jamaica.[47] Alpha killed 26\u00a0people in the Caribbean.[52] In Central America, Beta killed nine people and caused US$11.5\u00a0million in damage when it struck Nicaragua in October.[53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] In November, Tropical Storm Gamma killed two people in Bequia in the Grenadines, 34\u00a0people in Honduras, and 3 in Belize.[61][62] Unusual impacts were felt in Europe and nearby islands. The remnants of Maria caused a landslide in Norway that killed three people.[63][64] The unnamed subtropical storm in October moved through the Azores.[65] Also in October, Vince became the first recorded tropical cyclone to strike Spain, making landfall at tropical depression intensity.[66] In November, the extratropical remnants of Delta struck the Canary Islands, causing 7 fatalities, with 12\u00a0people missing.[67]"

The depression became a tropical storm on August\u00a024 and a hurricane on August\u00a025, making landfall as a Category\u00a01 hurricane in southeastern Florida.[34] Katrina imparted about $500\u00a0million in crop and infrastructure damage to the state.[101][102] The hurricane quickly crossed Florida and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Katrina rapidly intensified to Category\u00a05 status early on August\u00a028, becoming the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane. Turning northward, the hurricane weakened as it approached the northern Gulf Coast. On August\u00a029 at 11:10\u00a0UTC, Katrina made landfall in southeastern Louisiana as a Category\u00a03 hurricane, with 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) winds, and a barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg);[34] it was the third lowest pressure for a landfalling United States hurricane at the time, and fourth as of 2018.[34][103] Katrina then crossed the Breton Sound, making a third and final landfall with 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) winds near Pearlington, Mississippi. The cyclone quickly weakened after moving inland and became extratropical over Kentucky on August\u00a030.[34] On August\u00a028, the New Orleans National Weather Service issued an urgent weather bulletin describing potentially catastrophic impacts, comparing Katrina to Hurricane Camille of 1969. That same day, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin issued the city's first-ever mandatory evacuation. About 80% of the city and 83% of neighboring Jefferson Parish evacuated ahead of the storm.[104] The hurricane left catastrophic damage across southern Louisiana, with more than 300,000\u00a0houses damaged or destroyed; most of these were in Orleans Parish.[105] In New Orleans, storm surge breached the levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and 17th Street and London Avenue Canals, flooding about 80% of the city. Portions of the city remained underwater for 43\u00a0days.[34] The Mississippi and Alabama coastlines also suffered catastrophic damage from the storm's 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) storm surge, with very few structures remaining on the coast of the former.[34] Across the region, the hurricane flooded and ruined about 350,000\u00a0vehicles. About 2.4\u00a0million people lost access to clean drinking water.[106] Katrina also spawned an outbreak of 62\u00a0tornadoes across the eight states in the eastern United States.[34] Hurricane Katrina imparted catastrophic damage in portions of Louisiana and Mississippi, with overall damage estimated at $173\u00a0billion; this makes Katrina the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Throughout the United States, Katrina killed 1,392 people, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes in the United States,[107][108][34] and the deadliest American hurricane since 1928.[104] The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managed the aftermath of the hurricane, and faced criticism for its response time, lack of coordination with state agencies, supply shortages, and insufficient housing for federal workers.[109] Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs following the hurricane.[104] Residents across the New Orleans area suffered health effects, including rashes and respiratory problems, from polluted water and air following the hurricane.[106] Katrina forced about 800,000\u00a0people to move temporarily, which was the greatest number of displaced people in the country since the Dust Bowl. The United States federal government spent $110.6\u00a0billion in relief, recovery and rebuilding efforts, including $16\u00a0billion toward rebuilding houses, which was the nation's largest ever housing recovery project. Within a year of the storm, most of the levees were largely repaired.[110] Various countries and international agencies sent supplies or financial aid to assist in the hurricane response.[111]"

Storm surge also damaged homes in adjoining Jefferson County in Texas. In New Orleans, Rita produced additional flooding and overtopped levees that had been repaired after Hurricane Katrina a month earlier.

Wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a026, which was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm a day later over Atlantic Canada.[47] In its formative stages, Wilma's large circulation spread across much of the western Caribbean Sea, killing 12\u00a0people in Haiti and one in Jamaica.[47] Wilma set a record in Mexico, and for the entire Western Hemisphere, for the highest 24\u00a0hour rainfall total, with 64.330\u00a0in (1,633.98\u00a0mm) recorded at Isla Mujeres.[46][152] There were four deaths in Mexico, and nationwide damage was estimated at US$454\u00a0million ($4.8\u00a0billion MXN).[47][42] Local and federal troops quelled looting and rioting in Canc\u00fan.[153][154] Canc\u00fan's airport was closed to the public in the days after the storm, forcing stranded visitors to fly out of M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, the region's closest functioning airport.[155] On November\u00a028, Mexico declared a disaster area for 9 of Quintana Roo's 11\u00a0municipalities.[42] Mexico's development bank \u2013 Nacional Financiera \u2013 provided financial assistance for businesses affected by Wilma and Stan through a $400\u00a0million fund (MXN, US$38\u00a0million).[156] A significant storm surge flooded areas of western Cuba, leaving US$704\u00a0million in damage.[48] In Florida, Wilma caused $19\u00a0billion in damage and killed 30\u00a0people; five of the deaths were caused directly by the hurricane.[39][40][47] Wilma inflicted a multi-billion dollar disaster in the Miami metropolitan area, including $2.9\u00a0billion in damage in Palm Beach County,[157] $2\u00a0billion in Miami-Dade County, and $1.2\u00a0billion in Broward County.[158] Numerous homes and businesses experienced some degree of impact, with over 55,000\u00a0dwellings and 3,600\u00a0workplaces damaged in Palm Beach County alone.[157] On October\u00a024, 2005, the same day Wilma made landfall in Florida, President George W. Bush approved a disaster declaration for 13\u00a0Florida counties. FEMA expended $342.5\u00a0million to the 227,321\u00a0approved applicants. Additionally, public assistance from FEMA totaled over $1.4\u00a0billion and grants for hazard mitigation projects exceeded $141.5\u00a0million.[159] After leaving Florida, Wilma killed one person and left US$6.4\u00a0million in damage to the Bahamas, when it passed northwest of the country.[47][46] On Bermuda, Hurricane Wilma produced wind gusts of 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h).[46]"

Alpha weakened to a tropical depression over Hispaniola's steep mountains. The cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean, where it was absorbed by Hurricane Wilma on October\u00a024.

However, Beta weakened to a Category\u00a02 prior to landfall in Nicaragua. The storm rapidly weakened inland and dissipated on October\u00a031.[161] The Colombian island of Providencia was subjected to hurricane-force winds for several hours as the center of the storm moved very slowly by the island. Reports indicate extensive damage to homes and a loss of communications with the islanders.[161] In Honduras and Nicaragua, over 1,000\u00a0structures were damaged by the storm, hundreds of which were destroyed.

The remnants of the depression continued westward and moved along the northern shore of Honduras, merging with parts of a larger low pressure system. It is uncertain whether the remnants of Gamma absorbed the low pressure system or vice versa. The storm strengthened and a closed circulation formed on November\u00a018, making Gamma a tropical storm for the second time. After regeneration, and after making landfall over northern Honduras, floods from Gamma killed 34\u00a0people in Honduras. Three people died in Belize related to the storm. Gamma meandered in the Caribbean Sea for a short time, until slowly weakening and eventually disintegrating into a remnant low late on November\u00a020.[62] The storm caused 39\u00a0deaths in total.[62][61]"

Convection developed atop the center of the nascent disturbance two days later, and satellite data suggested that it was acquiring thermodynamic characteristics exhibited by tropical cyclones. On November\u00a022, the NHC classified the low-pressure system as a subtropical storm with the name Delta. Delta took a south-southwestward course and further coalesced its associated showers, leading to its re-designation as a tropical storm on November\u00a023. It stalled 1,320 miles (2,120\u00a0km) west-southwest of the Canary Islands and attained peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) on November\u00a024. Delta moved erratically over the next two days and weakened to a low-end tropical storm in response to increasing wind shear. A strengthening trough over western Europe accelerated Delta towards the east-northeast on November\u00a027, concurrent with the brief emergence of an eye and a period of intensification. Delta's tropical characteristics later succumbed to wind shear and cold air, resulting in its extratropical transition on November\u00a028 while 250 miles (400\u00a0km) west-northwest of the western Canary Islands; as an extratropical system, Delta tracked east, passing north of the Canary Islands before moving into Morocco and Algeria on November\u00a029, where it dissipated.[67] Delta caused severe damage in the Canary Islands and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned after boats overturned; there were 12\u00a0people missing from the overturned boat.[67] El Dedo de Dios, a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for the Canary Islands, was toppled during the storm.[162] Damage throughout the Canary Islands was estimated at \u20ac312\u00a0million ($364\u00a0million 2005 US dollars).[163] Delta also caused power outages, leaving some 200,000\u00a0people without power and forcing airports to close down.[67][164] The remnants of Delta later moved into Morocco, bringing needed rain.[165]"

The NHC consistently forecast that the storm would weaken; however, Epsilon gradually intensified as it moved westward and later looped to the northeast. The storm attained hurricane status on December\u00a02 as the track shifted to the east. Neither Epsilon's structure or strength changed appreciably over the next few days, and it attained peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) on December\u00a05. A building ridge turned Epsilon to the southwest on December\u00a06, and it maintained its intensity due to low wind shear. Epsilon remained a hurricane until December\u00a07.

Zeta weakened again as it turned westward, degenerating into a remnant low on January\u00a06; the circulation dissipated on the next day to the southeast of Bermuda.[167] Zeta affected the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race by producing high swells that moved boats off course.[168]"

The committee agreed that the usage of the Greek alphabet had a \"major important political, economic and social impact globally, which might not have happened if a secondary or circular list of names had been used\",[46] and that the Greek alphabet would be used again if the traditional naming list was exhausted. It was also decided that it was not practical to retire a Greek letter. Storms named with Greek letters that would otherwise be eligible for retirement would appear in the retired name list, but have a notation affixed with the circumstances.[46] However, when faced with retiring Eta and Iota following the 2020 season, when the Greek alphabet was next utilized, the WMO decided to discontinue its further use altogether. A new auxiliary list of given names was implemented, making any retirements less problematic.[178]"

The season began with an early start, with the formation of the first tropical cyclone on 29 July, which was only recognized as a tropical cyclone during post-season analysis. This was the second time that a tropical cyclone had formed during July. The other one was Cyclone Lindsay in the 1996\u20131997 season. The next tropical cyclone that formed was Cyclone Guba, which formed on 13 November with TCWC Port Moresby assigning the name Guba on 14 November, which was the first named storm within TCWC Port Moresby's area of responsibility since Cyclone Epi in June 2003. Guba was also the first cyclone to occur in the Queensland region in November since 1977. Tropical Cyclone Lee also formed on 13 November and was named by TCWC Perth on 14 November, with the system moving into RSMC R\u00e9union's area of responsibility and being renamed Ariel. The next Cyclone to form within the Australian region was Melanie, which formed on 27 December and was named on the 28th by TCWC Perth. Melanie was the first storm of the season to require cyclone watches, and warnings were issued for the Pilbara coast, but it had weakened into a low-pressure area before it made landfall. Tropical Cyclone Helen was the first tropical cyclone to form in 2008, in the Southern Hemisphere, forming in TCWC Darwin's area of responsibility. Helen marked the first time that Darwin had experienced a tropical cyclone since Cyclone Gretel in the 1984\u201385 season.[1] Cyclone Nicholas made landfall north of Carnarvon on 20 February as a category one cyclone. Cyclone Ophelia actually formed in TCWC Darwin's area of responsibility, but had moved into TCWC Perth's area when it was named. Tropical Cyclone Pancho formed on 23 March to the south of Christmas Island, and was named by TCWC Perth on 25 March; the system eventually reached category 4 status, with winds of 95\u00a0kn (176\u00a0km/h). In April 2008, Tropical Cyclones Rosie and Durga were the first tropical depressions to be monitored within TCWC Jakarta's area of responsibility and Durga was also the first storm to reach tropical cyclone status and named whilst being monitored by TCWC Jakarta. Durga was also the last storm of the season, which officially ended on 30 April."

However, this number was withdrawn in RSMC La Reunion's post\u2013storm analysis.[2] The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the developing system on 29 July,[3] and initiated warnings on the tropical cyclone late that day, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 01S.[4] However, by this time, the cyclone had crossed 90E and entered TCWC Perth's Area of Responsibility, which designated it as a Tropical Low and issued shipping warnings on the Tropical Low.[2] Early on 30 July, the tropical cyclone began to dissipate, so the JTWC issued their final advisory on the system on that day.[5] and the Bureau of Meteorology issued its last warning the next day.[2] During post\u2013storm analysis, The Bureau of Meteorology upgraded the tropical low to a tropical cyclone in its post-storm analysis, with maximum 10-min sustained winds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph), based on QuikSCAT observations. The cyclone was estimated to have reached tropical cyclone intensity from 29 to 30 July.[2] The tropical cyclone is the second on record to exist in the Western Australian region in July, the other being Cyclone Lindsay in 1996.[2]"

Shortly after, TCWC Brisbane upgraded the system to Tropical Cyclone Guba, which was a name assigned by the TCWC in Port Moresby.[15] Guba drifted erratically off the Queensland coast for the next two days, and intensified on 16 November, becoming a Category\u00a03 severe tropical cyclone. Guba was a small, but intense system, forming a well-defined eye. Guba began weakening on 17 November as it started to accelerate to the west towards the Queensland coast. However, it later turned northwards, avoiding the Australian mainland, then north-east while it continued to weaken. TCWC Brisbane downgraded Guba below tropical cyclone strength, and issued its last advisory early on 20 November. Flooding in Papua New Guinea led to at least 150 deaths.[16] In the Oro Province, about 2,000\u00a0people were evacuated as a result of the flooding.[17] Roads, bridges and 40 houses were washed away, as tides in the area reached two metres high.[18] The provincial capital, Popondetta, had its water supply shut down, and Papua New Guinea's national airline, Air Niugini, suspended flights to Popondetta's main airport. The Rabaraba district in Milne Bay Province was also hit by flooding, with 30 houses and food gardens washed away, and forcing the evacuation of about 100\u00a0people.[17] The government in Papua New Guinea reported that an estimated 145,000\u00a0people were affected from the flooding in Oro Province.[19] Six days of torrential rain led to a damage total of 200\u00a0million kina (US$71.4\u00a0million). Guba was the first tropical cyclone to be assigned a name from Port Moresby's name lists since Tropical Cyclone Epi in 2003. It is the first cyclone to occur in the Queensland region in the month of November since 1977.[20]"

The low had developed within a monsoon trough of low pressure, however a moderate amount of northerly wind shear located over the system was hampering any further development of the system. Over the next few days as the low moved towards the southeast, the wind shear gradually decreased, which meant that convection was able to wrap around the system's low level circulation centre and help it develop into a category one tropical cyclone on 22 April.

A total of 25\u00a0people were killed by the tornadoes,[2][3] with an additional 309 being injured, and more than 70,000 lost electricity. The path of the Nashville tornado was very similar to the one that hit East Nashville in 1998. A few additional tornadoes were also confirmed in Alabama, southeastern Missouri, and western Kentucky. Total damage from the event reached $1.607\u00a0billion according to the National Centers for Environmental Information.[1]"

                "content": "The threat for severe weather across Middle Tennessee and surrounding areas was not forecast well in advance. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) first issued a slight risk across northeastern Arkansas into the Tennessee Valley area in their 1:00\u00a0a.m. CST (06:00\u00a0UTC) March\u00a02 outlook. In their forecast, the SPC noted that an unstable atmosphere was likely to materialize ahead of an approaching cold front, but that this environment would likely be contained by a capping inversion for most of the day.[4] By the afternoon hours, the SPC expected the combination of rich moisture, modest wind shear, and cold mid-level temperatures to promote the formation of supercells with a primary risk of large hail. Some tornadic activity appeared possible overnight given an increase in low-level winds.[5] At 5:20\u00a0p.m. CST, the first tornado watch was issued from northern Arkansas northeastward into southern Indiana and western Kentucky as discrete storms began to develop.[6][7] By 11:00\u00a0p.m. CST, as a surface low progressed northeastward through southern Missouri, sustained barometric pressure falls caused supercell storms to give way to an organized storm cluster that gradually weakened as it progressed into an area of less abundant moisture.[8] As convection weakened to the north, the SPC began to monitor areas farther south \u2013 encompassing eastern Arkansas, West Tennessee, and southwestern Kentucky \u2013 for reinvigorated thunderstorm development as the northern jet stream amplified southeastward into the risk area. Strong wind shear coupled with low instability was expected to promote activity with \"a risk for severe hail, strong surface gusts and perhaps potential for a tornado or two.\"[9] At 11:20\u00a0p.m. CST, a localized tornado watch was issued across Middle Tennessee.[10] In subsequent hours, a long-lived and intense supercell produced ten tornadoes along the Interstate 40 corridor. A few hours after the Tennessee event, as severe weather moved farther south, a couple weaker tornadoes touched down in central Alabama as the outbreak wound down.[11]"

                "header": "Tennessee supercell",
                "content": "At 10:12\u00a0p.m. CST, the first tornado produced by the supercell touched down in Gibson County in West Tennessee. This tornado was rated EF1 and was followed minutes later by a stronger and longer-tracked EF2 tornado which traveled across much of Carroll County. After causing minor to moderate damage with these two tornadoes, the supercell quickly produced a third tornado, also rated EF2, that touched down north of Camden in Benton County. This tornado produced significant damage along a nearly 19-mile (31\u00a0km) path, killing one person in Benton County before crossing Kentucky Lake into Humphreys County in Middle Tennessee. It continued to produce damage until dissipating just north of Waverly at 11:31\u00a0p.m. CST. A fourth tornado, rated EF0, caused sporadic damage minutes later in the McEwen area.[12] Upon crossing into Dickson County, the supercell began to weaken somewhat, with a marked decrease in rotation as the cell moved through Dickson and into Cheatham County. However, very large hail was reported in the Charlotte area as the cell passed through. After passing just north of Pegram, the supercell immediately began showing signs of better organization as a well-defined hook echo reappeared on radar. Just after entering Davidson County, the fifth tornado associated with the cell commenced at 12:32\u00a0a.m. CST, approximately 7 miles (11\u00a0km) northeast of Pegram. A tornado warning was issued for Downtown Nashville three minutes later as the tornado crossed the Cumberland River and impacted the John C. Tune Airport, as well as the nearby headquarters and terminal of truckload carrier Western Express, Inc. It would go on to produce widespread EF2 to high-end EF3 damage in the communities of North Nashville, Germantown, East Nashville, Donelson, Hermitage,and Mount Juliet while traveling 60.13 miles (96.77\u00a0km) through Davidson, Wilson, and Smith counties, also causing heavy damage in Lebanon and Gordonsville. Five people were killed by the tornado, two in East Nashville and three near Mount Juliet, and 220 people were injured. After lifting, a sixth tornado, rated EF0, was quickly produced along the Smith\u2013Putnam county line. It moved across areas north of Buffalo Valley, dissipating as it tried to ascend the Highland Rim.[12] The seventh tornado was a violent EF4 tornado that caused catastrophic damage in Putnam County near Baxter and in the western part of Cookeville, resulting in 19 deaths and 87 injuries. It touched down northwest of Baxter at 1:48\u00a0a.m. CST, just as a tornado warning was issued for the area. The tornado moved toward the Double Springs community and quickly intensified. Producing a narrow swath of EF3 to EF4-strength damage, the tornado moved along U.S. 70N, causing catastrophic damage in neighborhoods along the path. The tornado abruptly dissipated just before reaching downtown Cookeville after a path of nearly 8.4 miles (13.5\u00a0km). This abrupt dissipation was due in part to a southern circulation developing within the cell to the south of Interstate 40, which later resulted in the eighth tornado, a brief EF0, southeast of Cookeville in Goffton.[12] As the northern circulation dissipated over Overton County, the southern circulation became dominant as the supercell climbed the Cumberland Plateau into Cumberland County. An EF2 tornado, the ninth from the cell, began near Rinnie, north of Crossville, and moved east into the Catoosa Wildlife Management Area, producing extensive tree damage. After apparent dissipation in wilderness near the Cumberland\u2013Morgan county border, a tenth tornado\u2014rated EF0\u2014produced minor damage a few miles east, just to the west of Lancing in East Tennessee. The final tornado produced by the cell dissipated at 3:40\u00a0a.m. EST (2:40\u00a0a.m. CST), four and a half hours after the first tornado in Gibson County.[12]"

Initially, just trees were downed as the tornado crossed the Cumberland River and moved through Bells Bend, where a barn was also destroyed. Damage along this initial segment of the path was rated EF0 to EF1. The tornado crossed the river a second time before heavily damaging the John C. Tune Airport and an industrial area along Centennial Boulevard, including a terminal and the headquarters of Western Express, Inc. at high-end EF2 strength. The airport sustained significant damage to its terminal and other buildings, with 17 metal hangars on the property destroyed. More than 90 aircraft parked at the airport, including charter jets, smaller airplanes, and a news helicopter operated by CBS affiliate WTVF were destroyed.[33] Maintaining high-end EF2 strength, it crossed Briley Parkway and struck the former Tennessee State Prison, which sustained considerable structural damage. It soon crossed the river again and struck the northern part of the Tennessee State University campus at EF2 intensity.[34] The tornado grew to nearly two-thirds of a mile (1.1\u00a0km) wide as it crossed Interstate 65 and moved into Germantown, just north of the Tennessee State Capitol, where it produced a widespread swath of mid to high-end EF2 damage. Throughout Germantown, numerous homes, churches, and apartment buildings sustained significant structural damage, including several large, multi-story apartment buildings that had their roofs and upper-floor exterior walls ripped off. An O'Reilly Auto Parts store was damaged and an AutoZone was almost completely destroyed.[34][35] It then crossed Interstate 24 at Spring Street and produced major EF3-strength damage in East Nashville, crossing the path of the April 16, 1998, F3 tornado in the Five Points neighborhood. Numerous businesses, restaurants, bars, homes, and apartment buildings were damaged or destroyed in Five Points, including Basement East, a popular music venue, which sustained major structural damage. A YMCA was badly damaged, and a Dollar General store was completely destroyed. Two fatalities occurred in Five Points when two pedestrians were struck by debris. The tornado continued through neighborhoods east of Five Points, causing EF2 damage to numerous homes, churches, and multi-story brick buildings. The tornado soon moved into Donelson, crossing the Stones River twice and destroying much of Donelson Christian Academy and the Stanford Estates subdivision as it rapidly re-intensified.[34][35] Numerous homes at Stanford Estates were destroyed and vehicles were thrown and mangled, and a few homes in this subdivision were leveled at high-end EF3 strength. Kroger, Panera Bread, and Petco, in addition to multiple apartment buildings, sustained considerable damage along Old Hickory Boulevard to the west. The tornado maintained EF2 strength as it paralleled Interstate 40 into Wilson County.[35] The tornado moved through Mount Juliet, producing a large swath of high-end EF3 damage as it crossed North Mount Juliet Road and substantially damaged Mount Juliet Christian Academy, West Wilson Middle School, and Stoner Creek Elementary. Numerous homes throughout town were heavily damaged or destroyed, a few of which were completely leveled. Two fatalities occurred in western Mount Juliet along Catalpa Drive. Maintaining EF3 intensity along a six-mile (9.7\u00a0km) swath, the tornado continued east of Mount Juliet along the north side of Interstate 40 towards Lebanon, causing severe damage in residential, commercial, and industrial areas between the two cities.[34][35] The last area of EF3-strength damage was observed to warehouses along Eastgate Boulevard before the tornado weakened to EF2 intensity, producing more damage across Highway 109 and along Leeville Pike and Tuckers Gap Road. Extensive tree damage occurred in this area, and multiple well-built homes had their roofs ripped off, a few of which had some exterior walls collapse. In Lebanon, many homes and businesses suffered considerable damage, including two large cemeteries, Lebanon Municipal Airport, Walmart, and Lowe's, as the tornado crossed South Hartmann Drive, South Maple Street, and South Cumberland Street (U.S. 231). As the tornado passed Linwood Road, a gas station and a heavy equipment auctioneer's property sustained low-end EF2 damage. The gas station had a canopy blown over and a couple exterior walls knocked down.[35] Continuing into Smith County, the tornado produced EF1-type damage in the Grant and New Middleton communities, snapping and uprooting many trees, damaging or destroying barns and outbuildings, and causing considerable roof damage to homes. The tornado dipped south of the interstate at New Middleton, continuing to damage houses and destroy outbuildings as it crossed ridges and valleys through southern Gordonsville, with most of the damage occurring on Agee Branch Road, Hickman Highway, and Maple Street. More tree and structural damage was observed as the tornado left Gordonsville at EF1 intensity before it lifted east-northeast of Hickman along Lancaster Highway at 1:35\u00a0a.m. CST (07:35 UTC).[34][35] The tornado caused 5 fatalities and 220 injuries along the 60.13-mile (96.77\u00a0km) path, which is one of the longest continuous damage paths in Tennessee history. Damage estimates from the tornado reached $1.504 billion, making it the 6th costliest tornado in United States history.[35]"

The tornado touched down along the north side of U.S. 70N and moved due east, producing EF0 damage to trees, outbuildings, and homes as it approached Highway 56 near Baxter. The tornado reached EF1 intensity as it crossed Highway 56 and moved through a residential subdivision. It caused minor to moderate roof damage to numerous homes and destroyed an outbuilding. The tornado intensified to EF2 strength as it crossed Prosperity Drive, tearing the roof and exterior walls off a home. Entering the community of Double Springs, the tornado heavily damaged or destroyed numerous homes and a garage structure at EF2 to EF3 strength, before cutting a narrow swath of intense damage across Bloomington Road, Clemmons Road, and Charlton Square. As the tornado crossed Charlton Square in the eastern part of the Eller Plantation subdivision, two homes were swept away. These homes were built on block foundations, but were fairly well-anchored, earning an EF4 rating. Numerous other nearby homes in the subdivision were also damaged or destroyed. Maintaining EF4 strength along a 0.8-mile (1.3\u00a0km) swath, the tornado crossed Plunk Whitson Road and moved eastward through more residential areas.[34][35] Catastrophic damage occurred in this area as entire portions of neighborhoods were completely flattened. Numerous fatalities occurred as at least 17 well-anchored block-foundation homes were leveled or swept away along Hensley Drive and North McBroom Chapel Road. Vehicles were thrown and severely damaged, and numerous trees were denuded and partially debarked in this area. Homes farther away from the center of the damage path sustained loss of roofs and exterior walls.[35] Continuing eastward, the tornado continued to produce EF4 damage as it leveled a large apartment building along the north side of U.S. 70N. Just east of this point, additional EF4 damage occurred in the Echo Valley subdivision, where many homes were leveled or swept away. The tornado continued along U.S. 70N, weakening to high-end EF3 strength as it flattened the Echo Valley Market, a local convenience store. EF3-strength damage continued as it impacted residential areas within the vicinity of South Drive and Locust Grove Road, damaging or destroying multiple homes. A few poorly-anchored homes were leveled or swept from their foundations along this segment of the path, while a small apartment building, a metal structure, and outbuildings also sustained significant damage. Several metal storage unit buildings were destroyed in this area as well.[35] The tornado weakened further to EF2 intensity as it crossed Tennessee Avenue and Miller Road, badly damaging a smoke shop and a metal-framed warehouse structure. Significant damage continued as the tornado moved due-east, following West Broad Street (U.S. 70N). Mobile homes and outbuildings were destroyed, and numerous frame homes were damaged, some of which sustained roof and exterior wall loss. A few businesses and other structures, including a bank and the Upper Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation, also sustained considerable damage as the tornado entered the Cookeville city limits.[34][35] A majority of the damage along this corridor was rated EF2, though a small pocket of low-end EF3 damage occurred near County Farm Road, where a poorly-anchored home was swept away. At the intersection of Pippin Road and West Jackson Street with West Broad Street, an Exxon gas station was severely damaged, and a small used car dealership across the street was leveled and swept away, with only the basement of the building remaining. This damage was given a high-end EF2 rating. Continuing towards downtown Cookeville, the tornado passed south of Sycamore Elementary School, downing trees and causing minor to moderate damage to homes and other structures at EF0 to EF1 strength. Additional EF0 to EF1 damage to trees, some apartment buildings, and homes occurred as the tornado crossed Buck Avenue and moved through areas just east of this point. The tornado then dissipated at Laurel Avenue and West 6th Street at 1:56\u00a0a.m. CST (07:56 UTC), just west of Cookeville Regional Medical Center and southwest of Tennessee Tech. The university remained closed for the two days following the storm. This tornado was given an EF4 rating, with maximum estimated winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h). A total of 19 people were killed and 87 more were injured along the 8.39-mile (13.50\u00a0km) path.[34][35]"

In Kentucky, golf-ball sized hail fell in Paducah during the afternoon of March 2.[36] Later a microburst with winds near 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) caused major damage to a marina on Lake Barkley in Kuttawa. One boat was blown off a lift and partially submerged; damage at the marina was estimated at $500,000 (2020 USD).[37] Flash flooding was also reported near the Hopkinsville Airport, where two cars were stranded, and Elkton due to the heavy rain.[38][39] Two roads in Coral Hill were also closed due to flowing water on the roadways.[40] In Tennessee, the long-tracked Nashville supercell also bought baseball-to-lime-sized hail to Charlotte, shattering windshields of numerous cars and causing roof damage to some homes, leading to $15,000 (2020 USD) in damage.[41] Later, after the Nashville EF3 tornado had lifted, a four-mile (6.4\u00a0km) long swath of straight-line winds of up to 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) affected eastern Smith County north of Lancaster, with several trees being snapped or uprooted and a few outbuildings suffering roof damage. Damage here was estimated at $10,000 (2020 USD).[42] Originally classified as an EF0 tornado, the beginning of the tornado track was shifted a couple miles west to the Smith\u2013Putnam county line.[26] Although spared from the worst impacts, Alabama also had their fair share of destructive weather the day after the outbreak on March 4. Severe thunderstorms bought destructive straight-line winds that downed numerous trees south of Interstate 85 across the southern part of the state. The highest wind gust was 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) at the Troy Municipal Airport, which coincided with the many reports of downed trees around the city of Troy.[43]"

President Donald Trump visited the state on March 6 and toured the hardest hit areas, including Putnam County.[46][47] The Nashville Predators opened their home venue, Bridgestone Arena, for victims of the storm to get help and free pizza on March 3.[48] Hands On Nashville, a local nonprofit, acted as a database for volunteers to assist with recovery efforts.[49] Metro Nashville Public Schools, Wilson County Schools, and Putnam County Schools were closed for the rest of the week, with Mount Juliet Christian Academy, West Wilson Middle School and the adjacent Stoner Creek Elementary in Mount Juliet being heavily damaged and closed the remainder of the school year. Donelson Christian Academy was mostly destroyed as well.[50][51] Schools in Wilson County never resumed after the tornado for the remainder of the 2019\u201320 school year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other schools in Mount Juliet were significantly restructured to accommodate students from West Wilson and Stoner Creek when the new school year began on August 17.[52] About 73,000 people across the state were left without power.[53] Interstate 40 was closed in both directions between Mount Juliet and Lebanon for 12 hours following the storm.[54] One year after the outbreak, Hope Park was dedicated in Putnam County on the properties of three homes destroyed by the tornado as a memorial to the 19 deaths in the county. Additionally, Tennessee Tech and the city of Cookeville honored the victims by ringing bells 19 times at 1:48\u00a0p.m. CST on March 3 (a year and 12 hours after the tornado touched down).[55] West Wilson Middle and Stoner Creek Elementary in Mount Juliet, which sustained catastrophic damage, were closed for the next two school years. Both schools had to be rebuilt, with demolition of the old buildings and construction of new schools starting in 2021.[56]"

Two election commission offices in Davidson County were designated as \"super sites\" where anyone from the counties affected by the tornadoes could vote.[57] Generators were supplied to polling sites without power. Fifteen sites diverted voters to alternate locations.[58] On request from four of the democratic primary candidates, the Davidson County Superior Court judge issued a ruling extending voting in the county by an hour; five sites were set to open for voting until 10:00\u00a0p.m. CST.[59]"

As of July 11, more than three times as many acres have burned compared to the previous year through that date, with drought, extreme heat, and reduced snowpack contributing to the severity of the fires.[9][10][11] The state also faces an increased risk of post-wildfire landslides.[12][13] As of August 18, 2021, the state of California was facing \"unprecedented fire conditions\" as multiple fires including the Dixie Fire, McFarland Fire, Caldor Fire, and others, raged on.[14] The USDA Forest Service temporarily closed all of California's national forests at the end of August to mitigate the impact of potential fires.[15] On October 18, 2021, much of the state\u2014particularly Northern California, where the majority of the significant fires had been located\u2014received its first major precipitation since the start of the wildfire season.[16] This significantly lowered wildfire risk in the region."

The Picayune also reported that breaches at Hushpakana[sic.] and Bolivar, Mississippi, had \"transformed the Yazoo Valley into an inland lake.\"[9] Mayor Louis A. Wiltz of New Orleans published a circular on May 30 addressed to \"the Mayors of thirty-four large American cities\" seeking contributions of cash and provisions for relief efforts. In the circular, the Flood of 1874 was described as the highest on record. It also included the observations of former U.S. Surveyor General for Louisiana William J. McCulloh, who estimated that a total of 12,565,060 acres had been flooded across Louisiana (8,065,000), Mississippi (2,500,000), and Arkansas (2,000,000).[10]"

Such was the devastation that, in its wake, Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans in Congress hailing from those states afflicted by the flooding made common cause to increase appropriations for the Rivers and Harbor Act to $19 million, $5.4 million of which was earmarked for internal improvements and federal aid to the flooded areas. While not opposed to internal improvements on principle, President Chester A. Arthur nonetheless vetoed the Act on August 1, 1882. Congress overrode his veto the following day.[11]"

At its peak, the crevasse was estimated to flow approximately 100,000 cubic feet per second.[12] The inundation of land stretched across several Louisiana Parishes, causing floodwater to flow directly towards neighboring Gretna and Plaquemines Parish, while upstream the backwater caused noticeable rises in streams as far as Thibodaux and Raceland on Bayou Lafourche. The flooding was catastrophic, causing losses to most planted crops in the region and disrupting freight and passenger rail service on the West Bank of the river for several months."

In the summer of 1926 until the spring of 1927, heavy rains fell in eastern Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Ohio Valley. The White and Little Red rivers broke through the levees in Arkansas in February, flooding over 400\u00a0km2 (99,000 acres) with 3 to 5\u00a0m (9.8 to 16.4\u00a0ft) of water.[14]  The first levee break along the Mississippi River occurred a few miles south of Elaine, Arkansas, on March 29.[2] Over the next six weeks, numerous levees broke along the Mississippi River from Illinois to Louisiana, which inundated numerous towns in the Mississippi Valley. The break at Mounds Landing near Greenville, Mississippi, was the single greatest crevasse to ever occur along the Mississippi River. It flooded an area 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) wide and 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) long with up to 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) of water. Heavy spring rains caused a second major flood in the same region that June. In all, 73,500\u00a0km2 (28,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) which were home to more than 931,000 people were inundated. To avoid flooding the city of New Orleans, the governor of Louisiana allowed engineers to create the Poydras cut, which saved the city but led to the flooding of St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes instead. Millions of acres across seven states were flooded. Evacuees totaled 500,000. Economic losses were estimated at US$1 billion (1927 dollars), which was equivalent to almost one-third of the federal budget at that time.  \n[15]"

U.S. President Barack Obama declared the western counties of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi federal disaster areas.[20]    The Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway was operated for a second time to reduce river stages along the Lower Ohio River and the reach of the Mississippi River adjacent to the floodway. For the second time in 38 years, the Morganza Spillway has been opened, deliberately flooding 4,600 square miles (12,000\u00a0km2) of rural Louisiana to save most of Baton Rouge and New Orleans.[21]"

Specifically, drought in Australia is defined in relation to a rainfall deficiency of pastoral leases and is determined by decile analysis applied to a certain area.[2] Note that this definition uses rainfall only because long-term records are widely available across most of Australia. However, it does not take into account other variables that might be important for establishing surface water balance, such as evaporation and condensation. Historical climatic records are now sufficiently reliable to profile climate variability taking into account expectations for regions.[3] Bureau of Meteorology records since the 1860s show that a 'severe' drought has occurred in Australia, on average, once every 18 years.[4] State Governments are responsible for declaring a region drought affected and the declaration will take into account factors other than rainfall.[1] Australia has experienced a marked decrease in precipitation levels since 1994.[5] Deficiencies in northern Australia increased in 2013\u201314, leading to an extended drought period in certain parts of Queensland. Between 2017 and 2019, severe drought developed once more across much of eastern and inland Australia including Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, also extending into parts of South and Western Australia."

There was concern about Sydney's water supply.[10] By 1902, Australia's sheep population dropped from its 1891 level of 106 million to fewer than 54 million. Cattle numbers fell by more than 40 per cent. Sheep numbers did not return to 100 million until 1925. In the 1911\u20131915 period, Australia suffered a major drought, which failed the 1914 wheat crop.[11] From 1918 to 1920, a severe drought was experienced by Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Northern Territory (Darwin-Daly Waters area and central Australia), Western Australia (Fortescue area), Victoria, and Tasmania."

Parts of New South Wales, notably the central west, had record-low rainfall and in 1938 severe dry conditions intensified there and in Victoria, eastern South Australia and in southwest Australian grain-growing areas. An extremely dry six-month spell in Victorian forests contributed to the disastrous Black Friday bushfires of January 1939, before heavy rain came in late February 1939 over Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales.[12] The rains were only a brief respite, and 1940 was one of the driest years of the century over most of southern Australia, emptying the Nepean Dam in New South Wales and imposing water restrictions in Brisbane. Perth had its driest year of the 20th century. Heavy rain in the southeastern States in November 1940 and\u00a0January 1941 slightly eased the situation and 1942 was a year of good general rain, but an even worse 1944 resulted when dearth of winter\u2013spring rains led to failure of the wheat crop and required populations in northern Victoria to cart water. Into 1945, large rivers virtually dried up, with most of the Hunter River ceasing flow and the Hawkesbury drying up at North Richmond. There was no flow in the Murray above Echuca. Adelaide faced water shortages while main Victorian water storages were empty in April 1945 and water restrictions were imposed as far north as Townsville. Dust storms blanketed South Australia, northern Victoria and southern New South Wales through the summer of 1944\u201345.[13] Artist Russell Drysdale undertook 3-week 5000km tour, at the height of WW2, of wind-eroded drought-stricken areas on commission from The Sydney Morning Herald. The articles written by Keith Newman and variously headed \"The country in which there are no Bushfires. There is nothing to burn;\" \"Worst Drought in Australia's History;\" and \"An Artist's Journey Into Australia's Lost World,\" were generously illustrated with stark line drawings by Drysdale and appeared on subsequent days 16-19 December 1944.[14] The drought broke in the southern States in winter 1945, with a good wheat harvest that year, but in some regions of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales 1946 was the worst year of all, and only in 1947 did significant general rains end the long drought."

According to Primary Industries Minister, Ed Casey, \"the drought affected region stretched in a 200\u00a0km to 300\u00a0km wide strip from Stanthorpe to Charters Towers\".[23] So few wheat and barley crops survived, about half the usual for that year, that grains had to be imported from other states.[24] In June 1994, more than ten towns had lost irrigation systems; and some areas had gone five years without decent rainfall.[23] A part of the upper Darling River system collapsed during this drought. By October 1994, the Condamine River was exhausted, reverting to a series of ponds. Across the state, in more than 13,000 properties, totaling 40% of Queensland, was drought declared.[25] The flow past Goondiwindi was the lowest since 1940. Cotton farms near Moree and Narrabri had been allocated no water for irrigation, which resulted in a major loss of production.[25] The town of Warwick was particularly affected."

On one-to-two-year timeframes to the end of March 2019, rainfall deficiencies in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin, Australia's most extensive river system, were the third lowest on record, behind similar length timeframes between 1901 and 1903, and between 1918 and 1920.[51] In July 2019, climatologist David Jones from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology stated that the present drought was now officially the worst on record in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin, and \"had now exceeded the Federation Drought, the WWII drought and the Millennium drought in terms of its severity through the MDB\".[52] In October 2019, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology stated that drier and warmer and drier than average conditions were expected to persist at least until the end of the year with no relief in sight for most of the drought affected areas, influenced at least in part by a positive Indian Ocean Dipole and a prolonged period of negative SAM (Southern Annular Mode) during October and November.[53] Exacerbating the effects of diminished rainfall in this drought has been a record breaking run of above average monthly temperatures, lasting 36 months to October 2019.[54] As of December\u00a02019[update] the drought was continuing \u2013 including the driest November across Australia on record[55] \u2013 but the Bureau of Meteorology reported that the positive Indian Ocean Dipole had weakened to around 50% of its peak seen in mid October, possibly indicating a future improvement in conditions later in the Australian summer.[56] From 7-10 February 2020, many areas on the east coast of New South Wales received heavy and continuous rain, the heaviest falls for thirty years. 391.6 millimetres (15.42\u00a0in) of rain fell over the four days in Sydney, more than three times the February average.[57] Flooding was extensive, including areas such as Lake Conjola, that had been devastated by bushfires about 6 weeks earlier.[58] About 28500 people were affected by this drought.

Additionally, more than 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) of rain fell in the town of Mexico in central Missouri, with similar rainfall totals being reported in southern Illinois.[21] Parts of Kentucky and West Virginia were affected by flooding on July 26 as well, including Johnson, Magoffin, and Floyd counties in Kentucky and Mingo and McDowell counties in West Virginia.[22] Training thunderstorms began to form over Eastern Kentucky during the early hours of July 27, producing heavy rainfall periodically throughout the day. Jackson, Kentucky had its second-wettest day on record (since 1981), with 4.11 inches (104.4\u00a0mm) of rain falling.[18] During the late evening and overnight hours, a more substantial band of heavy rain and thunderstorms moved west to east along a stalled frontal boundary, resulting in subsequent extreme flooding across the counties of Perry, Knott, Breathitt, Letcher, Leslie, Clay, Owsley, Wolfe, Harlan, Johnson, Magoffin, Floyd, and Pike. Flooding was also reported in Southwest Virginia, in the areas of Wise and Dickenson counties, and the independent city of Norton, which are along the Kentucky border. On the morning of July 28, the WPC issued a moderate risk outlook for excessive rainfall over portions of Central and Eastern Kentucky and West Virginia.[23][24] The rainfall began to move towards West Virginia and central Kentucky the following day, and began to encompass almost all of West Virginia on July 29.[23][24][25] On the morning of July 29, the WPC issued a moderate risk outlook for excessive rainfall, but shifted it into Eastern Kentucky and almost all of West Virginia.[25] On the morning of July 31, a third moderate risk outlook for excessive rainfall was issued by the WPC over portions of Eastern Kentucky,[26] with more flooding occurring that night over the same areas as four days earlier. Elsewhere on July 30 and 31, Phoenix and Flagstaff, Arizona, along with rural areas of Arizona and southeast California sustained flooding due to heavy rain associated with the Southwest monsoon. Near Kingman, over 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) of rain fell in approximately 15 minutes on July 31, associated with widespread thunderstorm activity over both states and southern Nevada.[27] More rainfall impacted the same areas of Eastern Kentucky on July 31 and August 1, leading to renewed flooding in those areas, while areas of eastern Illinois, such as Jasper and Richland counties, picked up as much as 10\u201312 inches (250\u2013300\u00a0mm) of rain from August 1 into August 2.[28][29] On the morning of August 2, the Weather Prediction Center issued a moderate risk of excessive rainfall for parts of southern Illinois and Indiana and parts of western Kentucky.[30]\nAlso on August 2, central Mississippi, including parts of Madison, Yazoo, Holmes, and Attala counties, received as much as 8\u201310 inches (200\u2013250\u00a0mm) of rainfall, causing flooding that impacted roads and homes.[31][32] On the morning of August 7, WPC issued a moderate risk for excessive rainfall across portions of northeastern Iowa and southern Wisconsin.[33]"

Homes in Brentwood and Ladue were threatened by floodwater as well, with some residents evacuating.[21] Two people were killed in the St. Louis area: one in a car that was found submerged in 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) of water and another near Hazelwood found about a mile away from their abandoned tractor-trailer that had been flooded.[3] St. Louis set a new 24-hour rainfall record at over 9 inches (230\u00a0mm), beating the record of 7 inches (177.8\u00a0mm) from the 1915 Galveston hurricane.[38] This included 7.08 inches (179.8\u00a0mm) in just six hours. Over 20,000 residents lost power.[39] Flash flooding extended into Illinois along the I-64 corridor in St. Clair County,[40] and a nursing home was evacuated in Caseyville.[41] In Belleville, which received approximately 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rain, multiple roadways were closed due to high water, with a section of one street being washed away. Residents were assisted from two houses in town, and city parks sustained damage to parking lots, playgrounds, and bathrooms. Cahokia Heights had 15 to 20 homes with flood damage, along with more flooded streets, and Caseyville had a levee breach, leading to the evacuation of the nursing home. Other areas, such as East St. Louis and Swansea, had more flooded homes, while more communities escaped with only minor roadway flooding.[42]"

Many roads were shut down in these areas including Main Street in Hazard, Mayo Trail in Pikeville, KY 317 in Fleming-Neon, Lakeside Drive and Main Street in Jenkins, South Fork Road, South Mountain Road, Bold Camp Road, and Main Street in Pound, Virginia, and portions of US 23 in Wise, Virginia. Evacuations were ordered in the downtown areas of cities that were severely flooded including Hazard, Fleming-Neon, Jenkins, Martin, Pound, and Clintwood, Virginia.[52] The North Fork of the Kentucky River set record high crests in Whitesburg and Jackson,[18] and over 33,000 customers lost electricity.[53] Late on July 28 and into July 29, part of the city of Jackson was evacuated and KY 15 was closed after officials became concerned that water from the North Fork River would top Panbowl Dam along KY 15 and potentially flood approximately 110 homes, 13 businesses, and other structures around Panbowl Lake, although the river began receding before the dam was overtopped.[54] The North Fork River set a record crest in Jackson of 43.47 feet (13.25\u00a0m), besting the previous record of 43.1 feet (13.1\u00a0m) from February 4, 1939,[55] while meteorologists at the National Weather Service forecast office in Jackson became trapped at the office due to nearby high water.[56] The rainfall observed over the region during the period of July 25\u201330 was over 600 percent of normal totals. The four-day rainfall totals of 14\u201316 inches (360\u2013410\u00a0mm) in some areas were reported to have a less than a 0.1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.[57]"

Casinos on the Strip that were impacted included Caesars Palace and Planet Hollywood, with water pouring through parts of the ceilings into the buildings. Las Vegas Boulevard and Main Street, especially in downtown and the area of the Strip, were covered in water, creating traffic problems. Fire departments and first responders had 330 calls for flooding and swift water service, with seven people being rescued from floodwaters.[67] The seasonal monsoon rains in the area partially contributed to a water rise of 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) in Lake Mead from July 26 to 31, along with water releases from Lake Powell.[68]"

Elden Estates, Paradise, Grandview, and Sunnyside. Other neighborhoods such as Cheshire, Coconino Estates, Creighton Estates, Coyote Springs, Anasazi Ridge were later added to the state of emergency order.

This led to flooding of roads and low-lying areas and prompted four water rescues, two of which were from partially submerged vehicles. A voting precinct in Downtown Phoenix was closed by the Maricopa County Elections Department due to flooding in the building, forcing it to be relocated elsewhere within the building for subsequent days. Numerous streets in Phoenix became temporarily flooded due to the heavy rain.[71] Several homes and apartment complexes became flooded as well.[72] In southern California, Death Valley National Park and the Mojave National Preserve were impacted by flooding on July 30 and 31, resulting in numerous road and campground closures and damaged/destroyed vehicles. Heavy rain in the San Bernardino National Forest resulted in mudslides that blocked roads near Yucaipa.[27]"

B. Pritzker declared St. Clair County, including East St. Louis, a disaster area, and the city of East St. Louis later declared a state of emergency following the flooding on July 26.[108] A shelter was opened on July 28 at the Breathitt County Courthouse in Jackson for displaced residents, as well as other shelters in schools and churches around Perry County and Hazard and the Floyd County Community Center near the town of Martin.[10] Wolfe County, north of Jackson, opened three school buildings as shelters as well.[56] About 150 residents were housed at nearby state parks, while at least another 150 went to American Red Cross shelters. Curfews were established in areas such as Hindman and Breathitt County after reports of looting.[109] Some residents in Kentucky were stuck in their homes, unable to leave because of washed out roads and bridges, leading to over 420 people being rescued by helicopter or boat.[109] By August 2, more than 5,600 customers in eastern Kentucky were still without power and more than 18,000 service connections were without water. An additional 45,600 customers were under a boil water advisory, according to Governor Beshear. Numerous people remained stranded in rural areas as a result of roads being washed away, with the only access in some instances being by ATV. The infrastructure problems caused difficulty in pinpointing the number of missing people in the days after the event.[63] The office manager of Troublesome Creek Stringed Instrument Company in Hindman set up a GoFundMe account for donations to help with flood relief, while Appalshop and Hindman Settlement School received help to keep valuable media archives refrigerated to prevent ruin. Some archives were transported to a freezer at East Tennessee State University in the days after the event.[110] School systems in Perry, Breathitt, and Floyd counties delayed the start of the school year due to recovery efforts. Several classrooms in Breathitt County were destroyed, along with the district's maintenance building and the bus garage.[111] Several other counties in the area had modified starts to the school year as well.[63] The University of Kentucky men's basketball team announced plans to play two games against Gonzaga, in 2022 and 2023, to raise money for Kentucky flood relief.[112]"

On Christmas Day 2012 (December 25), a tornado outbreak occurred across the Southern United States. This severe weather/tornado event affected the United States Gulf Coast and southern East Coast over a two-day span. It occurred in conjunction with a much larger winter storm event that brought blizzard conditions to much of the interior United States. In total, 31\u00a0tornadoes were confirmed by the National Weather Service in five states from Texas to North Carolina. All but one of the tornadoes that occurred during the outbreak touched down on December\u00a025, with the other occurring the following day in North Carolina. Two of the tornadoes were destructive enough to be rated EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. At least 16 people died as a result of the related blizzard, and thousands were without power. There were 63\u00a0preliminary local storm reports received for tornadoes, including 60 in four states on December\u00a025 alone.[4][5] Significant tornadoes included a long\u2013tracked EF3 that moved across areas of Mississippi and an EF2 that moved through Mobile, Alabama. The Mobile tornado damaged many homes, businesses, a hospital, and a high school, with estimated damages totaling $1.35 million."

                "content": "On December 24, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a moderate risk of severe weather, valid for the following day, as conditions became favorable for severe weather. The moderate risk covered an area stretching from west-central Louisiana to west-central Alabama[6] and was expanded south and west on December\u00a025 to include cities such as Port Arthur, New Orleans, and Mobile.[7] From a meteorological standpoint, the outbreak was caused by a vigorous upper-level trough that moved southeast into Texas from the Rocky Mountains on the evening of December 24, becoming a powerful, negatively-tilted shortwave trough on December\u00a025.[8] In response to the shortwave trough, a surface low formed over south-central Texas by 1200 UTC that morning.[9] Warm, moist air near the surface flowed northward along a warm front extending east from the surface low along the gulf coast on the morning of December\u00a025.[10] Meanwhile, a cold front and dry line had formed to the southwest of the surface low and advanced eastward through the morning, providing a source of lift for convection to form in eastern Texas.[9] Initially, the convection congealed into a quasi-linear convective system while over northeast Texas and western Louisiana, with only a few tornadoes touching down in these areas.[11] Later in the afternoon, enough energy associated with the advancing shortwave trough allowed for the formation of discrete tornadic supercells ahead of the advancing squall line in Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and southern Alabama, and around the same time, the SPC issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) tornado watch for extreme eastern Louisiana, southern and central Mississippi, and western Alabama.[12] Southerly winds near the surface increased, providing strong low-level and deep layer wind shear needed for these cells, which would later produce tornadic activity.[13] By late-evening, most storms had congealed into a squall line and weakened due to waning instability.[14] In the early morning of December 25, a mix of rain and snow began to develop as the upper-level trough began to interact with low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.[15] The system intensified as it moved across the southern plains and into the Mississippi Valley on Christmas Day. The system was able to pull in cold arctic air, causing snow and freezing rain in the south, leading to a rare \"White Christmas\" event for that portion of the country.[16] As the system moved through the Tennessee Valley overnight into December 26, heavy snow continued in the Ohio Valley.[17] A number areas in the Ohio Valley region, including Dayton, Ohio and Miamisburg, Ohio, and other locations, like Arkansas, also experienced thundersnow.[18] As the day progressed, the system brought snow into the Great Lakes region, and a new low pressure center began to develop in North Carolina.[19] Environment Canada also reported that the system began impacting Ontario that day, bringing heavy snow to the province.[20] The system moved into the Northeast early December 27, with the upper-level trough moving just off the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula.[21] At this point, the storm reached its lowest reported central pressure of 987\u00a0mb (29.15\u00a0inHg).[22] As the day progressed, the system began to weaken, with the pressure rising,[23] as it continued to move to the northeast, impacting New England, as the system tracked toward the Canadian Maritimes overnight into December 28.[24] That same day, Environment Canada reported heavy and blowing snow over Montreal, Quebec.[25] Early on December 28, the system moved through Nova Scotia, bringing heavy rain and snow before it moved out over the Atlantic Ocean.[26] During the next couple of days, the system slowly moved into the Atlantic Ocean, before accelerating eastward across the Atlantic on December 30. On December 31, the winter storm was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone, just northwest of the United Kingdom.[2]"

                "content": "This strong and long-tracked EF3 tornado touched down in Pearl River County, just southwest of McNeill where it downed several trees at EF0 to EF1 intensity along Harris Road. It then rapidly intensified to high-end EF2 strength as it impacted the western edge of McNeill, where many trees were snapped and multiple houses were heavily damaged or destroyed. A small house along Joe Smith Road was left with only a few walls standing, and an elderly woman was critically injured inside. A nearby brick house had its roof torn off. A strong velocity couplet and debris ball became visible on Doppler weather radar by this time. The tornado reached its peak strength of EF3 as it crossed Stones Chapel Road at the north edge of town, where it destroyed a single-story brick triplex, with only two interior walls left standing. A nearby house was heavily damaged at EF2 strength, and a few others sustained lesser damage in the area. One house in McNeill that was damaged beyond repair had survived effects from both Hurricane Camille and Hurricane Katrina. It then weakened back to EF2 strength as it crossed US 11, snapping numerous trees and tearing the roofs off of some houses. The tornado weakened further and crossed I-59, moving through unpopulated rural areas southeast of Poplarville, causing EF0 to EF1 tree and outbuilding damage. The tornado then struck a house at EF1 strength near the Stone County line, causing heavy roof damage. Eight people were injured in Pearl River County, 22 houses were destroyed or damaged beyond repair, eight had major damage, 16 had minor damage, and an additional nine were affected in some way.[65][66] The tornado strengthened to EF2 intensity again as it entered Stone County west of Texas, and caused significant damage to a few houses. Numerous pine trees were snapped at a campground in this area, and a mobile house and several more trees were downed before the tornado moved out of Stone County.[67] The tornado then moved into Forrest County and produced high-end EF2 damage as it passed near the small community of Maxie, where numerous trees and power lines were downed, two double-wide mobile homes were completely destroyed, a pickup truck was rolled, and a camper was thrown about 50 yards (46\u00a0m). Two additional double-wide mobile homes were severely damaged, a single-wide mobile home also sustained major damage, and a falling tree demolished a travel trailer. Four people were injured in Forrest County.[68] The tornado momentarily weakened to EF1 intensity as it crossed into Perry County and moved through portions of the DeSoto National Forest, downing many trees. A house sustained considerable roof and window damage, outbuildings were destroyed, and two cars were moved along this segment of the path. It quickly regained EF2 status as it crossed MS 29 and snapped several wooden electrical transmission poles. The tornado then destroyed a mobile home and a hunting camp before weakening back to EF1 status, damaging a few homes, and downing many more trees. The path length through Perry County was about 20 miles (32\u00a0km).[67] The tornado then crossed into Greene County and made a direct hit on the small town of McLain as an EF1, causing roof damage to an elementary school and a few houses. Damage to signs and the siding of a church also occurred. It also downed several trees before lifting as it exited McLain.[67] The tornado tracked for 60.4 miles (97.2\u00a0km) across five counties and injured 12 people.[68]"

The tornado initially touched down at 2254\u00a0UTC (4:54\u00a0p.m. CST) in the northern part of the Mertz neighborhood of Mobile, just northwest of I-10. The tornado initially produced EF0 damage in neighborhoods along Holcomb Avenue as it moved due north. Damage along this portion of the path consisted of snapped tree limbs, along with minor damage to a fence and a metal building. The tornado began to strengthen and grow in size as it approached and moved through the intersection of Government Street and the Dauphin Island Parkway. EF1 damage occurred in this area as multiple homes sustained roof damage and broken windows, trees and power lines were downed, and several businesses sustained considerable damage. One business sustained outward collapse of an exterior wall, and a brick structure sustained major damage to its second floor. The tornado then reached EF2 strength as it crossed Clearmont Street and struck Murphy High School, which sustained significant damage.[69] Damage at the high school included many broken windows, six portable classrooms being completely destroyed, the roofs being torn off of the auditorium and band building, and other large portions of roof being lifted off the building, only to be deposited back onto the structure. A metal-framed outbuilding was completely destroyed near the athletic field as well.[70] The tornado continued northward and inflicted EF2 damage to several homes and Trinity Episcopal Church.[69][71] At the church, part of a new slate roof was blown into the parking lot and a large portion of an exterior brick wall was knocked out, leaving a portion of the building visible from the outside. Homes in surrounding neighborhoods had their roofs torn off, large trees were snapped and uprooted, and gas leaks were reported in the area.[72] The tornado widened to its widest point of 200 yards (180\u00a0m) along this portion of the path.[69][73] The tornado continued to the north at EF2 intensity, ripping roofs off of homes as it crossed Springhill Avenue. By this point, a tornado emergency was declared for areas of Downtown Mobile at 2300\u00a0UTC (5:00\u00a0p.m. CST) as the large tornado approached those areas, stating Midtown Mobile, Downtown Mobile, and Prichard, Alabama as potentially affected areas. The tornado then weakened slightly to high-end EF1 strength, damaged several more homes, and blew out windows at Mobile Infirmary Medical Center, a hospital of more than 500 beds. Automobiles in the parking lot at the hospital were damaged, with one being flipped. It continued through the Allenville neighborhood, across I-165 and into Prichard. Damage along this segment of the path ranged from mid-range to high-end EF1, as multiple small homes and apartment buildings were damaged, some of which sustained roof loss.[74] It also tossed several shipping containers and damaged a warehouse facility, before producing additional minor EF0 damage in the Plateau neighborhood of Prichard and then lifting. Many trees and power lines were downed along the path, which totaled 5.7 miles (9.2\u00a0km). Several people suffered minor injuries.[69] While only existing for eleven minutes,[74] damage estimates to the cities of Mobile and Prichard totaled out at $1.35 million.[75][76] The tornado followed a path just east of the weaker EF1 December 20 tornado, which also impacted Mobile.[77]"
