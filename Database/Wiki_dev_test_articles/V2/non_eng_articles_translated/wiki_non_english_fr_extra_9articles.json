The storms of late December 1999 in Europe are two intense mid-latitude depressions with rapid development, named Lothar and Martin, which crossed Western Europe on December 26, 27, and 28, 1999. These two extremely powerful extratropical bomb cyclones caused major wind damage. The two depression systems caused the death of 140 people and nearly 19.2 billion dollars (2006) in material damage."

Thus, the last hurricane of the 1999 season occurred in November in the Caribbean, as mentioned in the report of the National Hurricane Center, the regional meteorological center specialized by the World Meteorological Organization for monitoring tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic. The mention of hurricanes referred by analogy only to the wind force according to the Beaufort scale."

At the end of that month, two other storms followed one another less than two days apart and were considered by the media as the storm of the century in Europe. The first, Lothar, was a compact depression that passed quickly without changing the zonal flow of atmospheric circulation, which allowed the next one, Martin, to follow closely. This latter storm, being of large diameter, was associated with a modification of the circulation that prevented other depressions from following it. These storms have two points in common:"

                "content": "Lothar is the name given to the storm that rapidly crossed northern France on the morning of Sunday, December 26, 1999. Moving from west to east along an approximate line near the forty-ninth parallel, this depression reached Finistère at around 2 a.m. and Strasbourg at 11 a.m., traveling at an average speed of 100 km/h. The most violent winds devastated a strip about 150 km wide along a curve starting from the tip of Brittany, passing through Normandy, Île-de-France, Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine, and Alsace. Lothar continued its path toward Germany, causing significant damage to infrastructure and forests such as the Black Forest. It caused unprecedented damage to forests in France, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark. Mountain winds reached speeds of 259 km/h. The depression formed off the coast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean in less than twenty-four hours. Exceptionally in Europe, the deepening of this storm intensified over land, reaching an atmospheric pressure of 960 hPa (960 mb), likely due to strong interaction with jet streams whose speed was around 400 km/h at just 9,000 meters altitude. According to a subsequent study by the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), the Austrian meteorological service, Lothar was followed by a secondary cyclogenesis trough that passed through Belgium and southwestern Germany, generating winds of over 90 km/h."

                "content": "This second very deep depression (down to 965 hPa at 4 p.m. in Brittany) crossed France at a significant speed (around 100 km/h) from the afternoon of Monday, December 27, 1999, to the following night. It developed off the coast of Brittany on December 27, reaching the region's coast around 4 p.m., before moving towards Nantes (7 p.m.), Romorantin (10 p.m.), Dijon (1 a.m. on December 28), and Alsace (4 a.m.). The regions most severely affected by the wind were Brittany, the Atlantic coast, particularly Charente-Maritime and Charente (198 km/h on Île d'Oléron), and then all areas south of a La Rochelle - Mâcon line, including the Côte d'Azur (gusts of 160 km/h unofficially recorded in Cannes). The wind continued to blow in Corsica on the morning of Tuesday, December 28, causing strong waves on the western coast. The storm also affected Spain, western Switzerland, and northern Italy. North of the depression, a cold air injection caused snowfall sticking to the ground in northern Brittany and Normandy from the afternoon of the 27th. During the night, the snow reached northeastern France as far as the Genevois, leaving flakes south of the Paris region. Meanwhile, significant amounts of rain caused flooding along its path. In some areas of the Alps, snowfall lasted two days, with the snow layer reaching about two meters."

                "content": "After the 1987 storm, European meteorological services improved their numerical weather prediction models. In 1999, Météo-France was able to predict the occurrence of the two storms. Based on existing models and exceptional variations in measured temperatures and pressure, Météo-France was able to issue a severe weather warning for strong winds 24 hours before the Lothar storm. Météo-France forecasters at all levels work closely with Civil Security services. On December 26 at 5:25 a.m., the Interministerial Crisis Management Operational Center (COGIC) of the Directorate of Civil Defense and Security (DDSC) received a phone call from Météo-France announcing that strong winds were heading towards Île-de-France and the eastern, northern, and central parts of the country. This phone report was confirmed by the issuance of a meteorological alarm bulletin (BAM) at 6:45 a.m., confirming a strong wind phenomenon with an average speed of 80 km/h, gusts of 120 km/h, and locally reaching up to 140 km/h. While the population was warned of an exceptional weather event, the strength of the gusts exceeded the forecasts. At 7:30 a.m., Météo-France announced an update to the BAM, reporting a windy episode that could last one to two hours in Île-de-France and the central region, with winds potentially reaching 140 km/h or even locally 160 km/h. At 8:15 a.m., Civil Security, at the request of Météo-France, prepared a press release to warn residents of the affected areas about the significant risks posed by the announced winds. The press alert, initially relayed by national bulletins from the Radio France group, came as the Lothar storm was already hitting Normandy. The short time between the alert issued by Météo-France and the occurrence of the storm did not allow for earlier communication to the population about the severity of the phenomenon. Furthermore, the alert was issued at the end of the night, the day after Christmas celebrations, a time when media consumption is low and populations are difficult to mobilize."

They mention wind gusts of up to 130 km/h inland and 150 km/h on the coasts and highlands. An alert bulletin is also issued for snowfall in Brittany. As was the case with Storm Lothar, the population remains largely unprepared due to insufficient anticipation in the alert chain and underestimation of the wind strength. Awareness of the intensity of the phenomenon, both by public authorities and the population, only occurs from 7:50 PM with the dissemination of the first information on major damage (collapse of the glass roof of La Rochelle station) in France Info's regular bulletins."

It was only on the morning of December 26 that alerts were issued following an adjustment of these models. Several local emergency service officials did not realize the importance of the storms and did not take the necessary measures, partly because it was during the Christmas holidays. Deutscher Wetterdienst (the German service) was criticized for not issuing an alert for Lothar. A post-analysis mentions that there was a computer problem in its communication system."

                "content": "Nearly 540 high and very high voltage lines and more than a thousand electrical pylons are out of service, representing about 8% of the electricity transmission network. Power outages affect 3.6 million households - or 10 million French people. Some departments are largely without electricity (Orne, Creuse, Corrèze, Haute-Vienne, Cantal, Lot-et-Garonne), and some entirely (Vosges, Charente-Maritime). Due to energy shortages and pollution affecting water distribution, 2.5 million residents must obtain water from stores. To restore its network, EDF relied on the help of around twenty countries, which provided personnel (1,500 technicians) and specialized equipment. A large part of the road network is impassable on Monday, December 27, including major routes such as the A10 motorway and National Route 10. Nearly 20,000 km of roads and forest trails providing access to massifs are damaged. Out of 32,000 km of railway tracks, 20,000 km are rendered unusable. The mobilization of 18,000 railway workers allows 95% of installations to be restored by December 31. Rail traffic returns to normal after a week. The costs of restoration and operational losses for SNCF amount to 510 million francs. Numerous flights are canceled, and some airports (Bordeaux-Mérignac, Clermont-Ferrand) are closed. Nearly one million subscribers are without landline telephone service due to fallen trees on overhead telephone lines and the rapid depletion of backup batteries in telephone exchanges and relay antennas. Nearly 3,500 mobile phone relay antennas (Itinéris, SFR, Bouygues Télécom) are out of service. The restoration of telephone networks cost approximately 1 billion francs for France Télécom, 100 million francs for SFR, and nearly 20 million for Bouygues Télécom. The near-identical reconstruction of France Télécom's telephone network will not be completed until April 2001."

                "content": "The forestry and agricultural damage is considerable, particularly in the timber sector. Hundreds of thousands of trees have been felled, with waterlogged soils contributing to their instability. The first estimate of this damage, carried out by the Regional Forestry and Timber Services (SRFB), evaluates the volume of felled (windthrow) and broken (breakage) wood at 140 million cubic meters (with a margin of error of 30%, i.e., between 98 and 182 million). The most affected regions are Lorraine (29.5 million cubic meters), Aquitaine (27.7), and Limousin (16.3). The resistance of trees varied depending on species and geographical areas: poplars in the Garonne and oaks in the Adour fared better than pines in Médoc and Douglas firs in Limousin, with mountainous areas faring better than plains. A subsequent and more precise assessment of the damage raised the windthrow volume to 176 million cubic meters. The extent of the damage, partly linked to poor forestry management, led foresters to question the practices that had prevailed until then. While viticulture was relatively spared, market gardeners and horticulturists saw thousands of hectares of greenhouses destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of fruit trees were felled or damaged in southwestern France, notably plum trees in Lot-et-Garonne and walnut trees in Périgord. The reconstruction of these orchards took about fifteen years. However, the livestock sector suffered the most significant damage (drowned animals, damaged or destroyed buildings). Stocks of fodder and silage were waterlogged, and cows had to be milked manually due to a lack of electricity, resulting in the loss of several million liters of milk. Power outages affected artificial incubators, freezers, and refrigeration systems. Many food businesses relying on cold storage (supermarkets, restaurants, bakeries, caterers) lost their entire stock during a period of high activity. Order and transport flows were disrupted, and the sector was affected by technical unemployment measures. On the Atlantic coast, the storm surge reached 40 to 60 cm, and 1.5 to 2 meters in Charente-Maritime. A quarter of the oyster farming facilities in the Marennes-Oléron basin were completely destroyed. However, some sectors benefited from unexpected expenditures, such as construction, public works, producers of building materials, and DIY equipment."

                "content": "The cost borne by insurance companies is significantly higher than that of the 1990 storms, which amounted to 8.6 billion francs. The French reinsurance group Scor estimated the total damages at nearly 33 billion francs. In 2000, the French Federation of Insurance Companies (FFSA) estimated the damages at 44.3 billion francs (6.75 billion euros), excluding deductibles, damages whose undeclared costs remained the responsibility of individuals and businesses, operating losses due to the temporary closure of factories, workshops, and shops, as well as the partial destruction of forest heritage. Compensation in France reached 7.5 billion euros under the \"storm\" guarantee and 275 million euros for floods. Half of the compensation was financed by reinsurers, while the rest was covered by the reserves of insurance companies and the Central Reinsurance Fund (CCR). Insurance companies were led to define stricter loss criteria, and reinsurance companies (Munich Re, Swiss Re, etc.) increased their rates by 5 to 30%. Faced with a significant decrease in the provisions of the Central Reinsurance Fund, public authorities significantly modified the surcharge rate for natural disasters, the deductibles applicable in the event of a claim, and the conditions of reinsurance. The financial burden on the state for the restoration of French forest heritage reached 2 billion francs in emergency aid in 2000, 12 billion in subsidized loans at 1.5%, 6 billion francs in subsidies over ten years for reconstruction, and 2 billion francs in \"storm\" amendments to state-region plan contracts."

The coordination of rescue operations was relayed with varying degrees of efficiency in the departments by the prefects with the establishment of crisis command centers. At the level of defense and security zones, the implementation of rescue efforts included the use of the interregional civil security coordination centers (CIRCOSC), but several affected zones (Center-West, Center-East) did not have any. At the national level, the government activated the decision support operations center (COAD) of the Ministry of the Interior and the joint operations center (COIA) under the Chief of Defense Staff. The COAD organized the dispatch of reinforcement columns of firefighters from the SDIS of departments spared by the storm and the assembly of civil security military units (UIISC) dispersed across various operational theaters (floods in Venezuela, the Erika shipwreck in Brittany). The army's intervention began quickly with the spontaneous engagement of units, initiated by corps commanders or base commanders, in the form of patrols aimed at ensuring the safety of people and the preliminary clearing of the road network. Within 48 hours, the COIA took over the coordination of army interventions in liaison with the military defense districts. Additionally, local initiatives attempted to compensate for the delayed arrival of rescue efforts in some isolated areas: creation of essential supply hubs at the cantonal level (Doubs, Charente-Maritime), visits to residents without means of contact by postal workers (Creuse), and a generator exchange market (Cantal)."

This concept has been adopted by many national meteorological services in Europe since then. Following these storms, a specific safety plan was established in French schools starting in 2002. Its objective is to prepare teaching teams, staff, and children in educational facilities for a crisis situation. As early as 2000, EDF, then the manager of the electricity distribution network in France, set up a Rapid Electricity Intervention Force (FIRE) composed of 2,500 volunteer technicians (2,300 initially), divided into 16 autonomous regional teams that can be mobilized at any time to restore electricity distribution to subscribers using heavy logistical means (generators, helicopter resources). By early 2007, although some areas remained untreated, most of the zones with fallen trees had been cleared."

Rainfall, exceeding 174 millimeters in some areas such as La Goulette, also caused traffic disruptions in Tunis and on several roads. Most neighborhoods in the medina of Tunis as well as several streets in the capital were also flooded. In the capital region, 77 millimeters of rain were recorded between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. The presidency later announced the cancellation of the ceremony organized on October 15 to mark the anniversary of the evacuation of the city of Bizerte by French troops in 1963.

Initial investigations revealed that the poor condition of the national road connecting Tunis to Bizerte was also a major cause of the high number of deaths in this area. On October 15, President Ben Ali convened a ministerial council that decided the Sabalet Ben Ammar area would be declared a flood-prone zone, prohibiting the issuance of any building permits and requiring that nothing obstruct the flow of water. Furthermore, any new construction project must be preceded by a mandatory hydraulic study, and coordination between the relevant ministries must be improved."

This event has also affected the entirety of Europe. Even though the low-water period decreased in the winter of 2022-2023, the recharge period was insufficient, and restrictions multiplied, leading to another drought in 2023. This situation results from a rainfall deficit starting in the winter of 2021-2022, which continued with a spring and early summer also marked by low rainfall, combined with several significant heatwaves that contributed to drying out the soil. This drought is simultaneously pluviometric (the observed deficit is the most significant after that of 1976), agricultural (the most severe since 1958), and hydrological (numerous rivers have dried up, and groundwater levels are low). Very large fires, some classified as megafires, broke out, mainly in Gironde but also in Brittany, Drôme, and Aveyron. The burned area in France, over 62,000 hectares as of August 20, is 7.5 times higher than the annual average of the previous fifteen years (2006-2021) but remains lower than that of 1976 (104,000 hectares burned during the year, including 88,000 during the summer). Agriculture was affected due to the dryness of the soil but also by irrigation bans that resulted from it. The management of this event by state services and local authorities is marked by the implementation of the organization defined in the 2021 decree, namely monitoring followed by the triggering of alerts and departmental orders for temporary restrictions on water use. At the peak of the event, 93 departments were affected by restrictions beyond vigilance in at least part of their territory: 3 were on alert, 12 on heightened alert, and 78 in crisis. The event raises many questions about future droughts, the means to anticipate them, and how to address them. Controversies arise, particularly regarding swimming pools, private jets, and the watering of sports fields. In this context, the government initiated discussions in the fall for the development of the third national climate change adaptation plan for the 2023-2028 period."

Temperatures remained very mild for the season for much of the winter. Across France and for the season, the average temperature of 6.6°C was 1.2°C above the 1981-2010 normal. On average across France, the rainfall deficit exceeded 10%. The deficit often exceeded 50% from Languedoc-Roussillon to the Cévennes as well as from Var to Alpes-Maritimes and in eastern Corsica. It was locally over 80% in Hérault and the eastern coastline of Haute-Corse. This winter is thus ranked among the ten driest winters in the 1959-2022 period in the PACA region, Languedoc-Roussillon, and Corsica."

The month of May was particularly abnormally warm and dry, with an average temperature of 17.8°C, 2.7°C above normal, making it the warmest May since 1900, ahead of May 2011 (+1.9°C). Regarding precipitation, after an already dry winter, the lack of rain continued: with a 45% precipitation deficit, spring 2022 is also the third driest since 1959. The deficit exceeded 60% in some areas of the Massif Central, along the Rhône Valley, and near the Belgian border. Conversely, rainfall totals were locally above average in eastern Corsica. According to Christian Viel, a climatologist at Météo-France, the exceptional drought in July and August results from the combination of two main factors: \"The first rainfall deficit occurred at the worst time, during the recharge period of groundwater in winter, from September to March, and was followed by an extremely dry spring with very high temperatures, which has now led to very dry conditions.\""

In terms of rainfall, a deficit of nearly 85% compared to the 1981-2010 normal was observed in July. This month was thus the driest on record for the 1959-2022 period on a national scale. It ranked as the second driest month across all months, behind March 1961, which had a deficit of nearly 90% with an average of 7.8 mm across the country. Hydrologically, after June, the situation continued to deteriorate in July. The number of hydrometric stations with a monthly average flow close to or above normal remained below 10%, with only 8% of stations showing a flow rate above 80% of the average annual flow observed in July (the same value as in June). Nearly half of the stations showed a flow rate below 40%, with the situation being particularly critical in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, PACA, and Pays de la Loire, and now worsening in Brittany, Lorraine, and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. Reserves were at their lowest by the end of August, leading to hundreds of small municipalities, as well as cities like Besançon, Chambéry, Chartres, Gérardmer (Vosges), and Nantes, experiencing or still facing tensions regarding their drinking water supply. As of September 1, about one-fifth of canals and rivers were subject to usage restrictions, and nearly 1,000 km were closed to navigation (14.8% of the network)."

However, as the soils continue to be extremely compact and dry, they promote runoff at the expense of water infiltration, a necessary condition for recharging aquifers, which act as underground reserves. The BRGM predicts that at the start of winter 2022-2023, aquifer levels will be significantly lower than the previous year and recommends maintaining water usage restrictions. As of September 15, 96 departments – the entirety of the mainland, including Paris – are under vigilance, alert, or worse, with 77 in crisis. October is extremely warm and fairly dry across France, which is problematic in terms of combating drought. Surface soil dryness reappears, and aquifers are not recharging. Water usage restrictions remain widespread across the country. In Roussillon, an extreme drought persists. In November, rain returns to most regions, but the results are mixed: while the Channel coasts and the Atlantic facade receive much more rain than usual, the eastern two-thirds of the country do not receive quite enough rain, and aquifer recharge is therefore not very effective.

The first meeting takes place on March 16, 2022, to review the evolution of the hydrological situation since the end of summer 2021 and the recharge of aquifers. The committee takes note of the indicators provided by Météo-France, including an average rainfall deficit of about 16% compared to normal for the period from September 2021 to February 2022 (except for the Pyrenean departments) and by the BRGM regarding groundwater levels, which specifies that in February, their levels are generally below monthly normals, ranging from moderately low to low. In light of this observation, Bérangère Abba, Secretary of State for Biodiversity under the Minister of Ecological Transition, announces the holding of a national crisis management exercise in April, based on a scenario of an intense drought episode following a heatwave. The second meeting, held on May 18, notes that the summer of 2022 could be marked by low water levels or significant drops in aquifers across the entire territory and that the regions of Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, the north of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Pays de la Loire, and Centre-Val de Loire could be particularly affected. During this meeting, the France Nature Environnement association warns about the increase in irrigation in France, which adds pressure to an already severely threatened water resource. According to figures from the 2020 general agricultural census, the utilized agricultural area is decreasing, but the share of irrigated utilized agricultural area has increased by 14% between 2010 and 2020. For example, the Occitanie region, which is already experiencing significant difficulties in water management, sees a 12.90% increase in its irrigated utilized agricultural area. The July 13 meeting acknowledges the extreme drought affecting the territory and recalls the government's mobilization on the issue, particularly the meetings of water resource committees organized at the prefectural level, with the aim of quickly informing stakeholders of the restriction measures to be taken and facilitating their acceptance, as well as the mobilization of monitoring networks in connection with regional health agencies (ARS), with a situation update reported at the national level each week."

A basin orientation decree concerning the Loire-Bretagne basin, particularly the Loire, was issued on January 28, 2022. Regarding coordinated measures on the Loire and the Allier, the vigilance threshold is triggered as soon as the average daily flow of the Loire measured at Gien falls below or equals 60 m3/s, the alert threshold at 50 m3/s, the reinforced alert threshold at 45 m3/s, and the crisis threshold at 43 m3/s. A departmental prefectural framework decree was issued on April 6, 2022. It defines the affected alert zones and observation stations, temporary measures for restricting or prohibiting withdrawals from surface and groundwater, as well as measures for restricting or prohibiting water usage, and sets the low-flow thresholds in each of the concerned watersheds, below which restrictions or prohibitions on withdrawals and water usage will apply. A departmental decree on temporary restrictions was issued on August 1, 2022. It noted the crossing of the alert flow threshold on the Loire axis and implemented provisional measures to limit water usage in the Loiret. The alert level in each of the hydrological units of the Loiret was as of August 3, 2022, as shown on the adjacent map. The flow rates of most of the department's watercourses are below the drought management threshold values. Thus: The Loire and Allier axes, previously under alert, will move to a reinforced alert situation, and the following restriction measures will be implemented: A complementary departmental decree was issued on August 8, 2022.

In 2022, the winter low water level of the Loire extended with a spring that was also very dry and particularly low flows upstream of Villerest. In this context, it was necessary to begin releasing water from the Villerest reservoir, which was then filled to its maximum regulatory level, starting at the beginning of May, to ensure the target flow of 12 m3/s immediately downstream of the structure. The volume in the reservoir decreased rapidly, reaching minimum levels for these dates since its commissioning between June 9 and 23. Daily water releases were made for each dam to provide up to 100% of the flow of the Allier upstream of Vic-le-Comte (Puy-de-Dôme), 85% of the flow of the Loire downstream of Villerest, 60% at Gien (Loiret), and 30% at Nantes. However, as reserves decreased, the targets were set at unprecedented low levels: 44 m3/s on August 2 and 38 m3/s on August 9.

Nine megafires, fires covering more than 1,000 hectares, occurred in France in 2022, mostly affecting coniferous forests. The burned area (62,075 ha) is 40% higher than in 2019 (43,602), the second most affected year in recent history, and more than six times higher than the average for the 2008-2021 period and 7.4 times higher than the annual average for the 2006-2021 period. Fourteen departments have more than 1,000 hectares of their territory burned by fires larger than 30 hectares. The following table presents the burned areas of these departments compared to the average burned area over the 2008-2021 period. Gironde and Pyrénées-Atlantiques are the two most affected departments. Maine-et-Loire is notable for having had no forest fires during the 2008-2021 period and 1,782 hectares burned in 2022. However, it should be noted that the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis) is a service of the Copernicus program (European Earth observation program) that records burned areas in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East using satellites through automatic image processing without \"expertise,\" meaning without on-the-ground confirmation. Thus, \"controlled\" fires are also counted and skew the figures: for example, controlled burns (or pastoral fires), organized to clear summer pastures, which are very common in winter in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, are counted in the same way as criminal or accidental fires. The difference between Effis estimates and figures provided by local authorities can be significant, as in Jura, where 886 hectares burned according to Effis, but more than 1,200 hectares according to authorities. In parallel with Effis, the Forest Fire Database (BDIFF) also records fires that have occurred on national territory since 2006. A comparison of the two databases shows that the total value of burned areas is up to three times greater with data measured by European satellites than with those reported by field actors in the national database. The 2022 data from the national database will not be available until spring 2023."

In Lot-et-Garonne, the head of the Rural Coordination expects water withdrawals from the Garonne to be drastically restricted by August 15 and protests. Similarly, farmers along the Loire and Allier rivers must cease all agricultural irrigation as soon as the Loire axis is declared in crisis. This decision is made by the prefect when the flow at Gien, in Loiret, drops below the threshold of 43 cubic meters per second. This threshold was crossed on August 14. Some irrigators' associations state that they are well aware that \"supplying drinking water to the population is a priority, but for agriculture, it is a disaster.

The controversy reignited on September 5. Questioned at a press conference about the excessive use of private jets for travel, the PSG coach explained that the club was considering traveling \"by sand yacht\" in the future, followed by Kylian Mbappé, who, when asked about the same topic, replied, \"I don't think anything.\" These remarks, which the coach later tried to downplay as \"a bad joke,\" provoked numerous outraged reactions from both the political class and the media. In fact, the issue of private jets had already been highlighted on social networks and various sites that track and evaluate the carbon footprint of private jets belonging to certain companies or individuals. Based on official data and crowdsourcing from thousands of receivers around the world, sites like www.flightradar24.com or www.adsbexchange.com display the private jet routes of celebrities and billionaires. Similarly, several Twitter accounts pursue the same goal, such as the account @ElonJet, which shares on Twitter all the movements of Elon Musk's plane. Its founder, young American developer Jack Sweeney, has created numerous similar accounts allowing, among other things, the tracking of movements by Mark Zuckerberg, the Russian state, and a range of billionaires and celebrities. Other internet users have launched their own accounts, such as @i_fly_Bernard (60,000 followers on Twitter) and @laviondebernard (75,000 followers on Instagram and 31,000 on Twitter). According to the Twitter account @i_fly_Bernard, in July, the six private jets of major French groups (Bouygues, Bolloré, Artémis, JCDecaux, and Arnault) made fifty-three flights and emitted 520 tons of CO2, equivalent to the emissions of an average French person over fifty-two years. The aviation sector is responsible for 2 to 3% of global CO2 emissions, but according to a report by Transport & Environment published in May, private flights have a carbon footprint per passenger five to fourteen times higher than commercial flights and fifty times higher than trains. A one-way Paris-Nice trip by private jet emits about two tons of CO2, equivalent to the annual carbon budget target for a French person by 2050. Some decry the Greens' diktats, while others warn of the climate emergency and the irresponsibility of certain individuals, arguing that the systemic change required by the ecological transition is impossible without social justice.

With 3.2 million private pools in 2021, this represents 0.12% of national consumption, including 0.02% for filling new pools. This estimate also includes draining a third of the pool during winterization, backwashing filters, and water used to compensate for evaporation. Even though these figures should be put into perspective as they do not account for water consumed during draining to renew the pool water, clean the bottom, or carry out maintenance, the actual overconsumption of private pools in France is difficult to assess because the average household water consumption (123 m³ per year in 2017) varies greatly between regions, and it is challenging to attribute these regional overconsumptions to pools. In any case, various experts, such as the head of the water service at the French Office for Biodiversity (OFB), believe that refilling pools is not an issue compared to overall consumption. Conversely, others, such as the water network coordinator at France Nature Environnement, argue that \"the debate cannot only focus on the volume of water consumed, but also on its utility\" and that \"in times of crisis, every cubic meter counts.\""

The project dates back about ten years but is only now coming to fruition after a lengthy legal process. The first basin was built in 2021 in the commune of Mauzé-sur-le-Mignon, already sparking protests. These agricultural water reservoirs, some of which are the size of fifteen football fields, store water drawn from groundwater and rivers. Their cost is estimated at 40 million euros, 70% of which is funded by public money. Opponents of the project particularly denounce the risk of water evaporation once on the surface, leading to a lowering of groundwater levels, as well as the loss of quality due to the proliferation of microorganisms caused by stagnation. For the project's proponents and the State, the construction of these reservoirs is an absolute necessity for agriculture in the context of climate change, and the existing regulations, already very strict, address environmental concerns and will be adhered to."

Subsequently, a decree related to the quantitative management of water resources outside the low-water period is published at the end of July 2022. While it is welcomed by the agricultural sector, some associations and local authorities oppose the changes introduced. This text modifies the conditions for withdrawals outside the low-water period: it notably introduces the possibility of defining \"volumes that may be available for anthropogenic uses\" and strengthens the role of the prefect in their evaluation, which satisfies agricultural representatives. Conversely, the association France Nature Environnement (FNE) and the National Federation of Conceding and Managed Authorities (FNCCR) consider that these changes challenge the balance established by the decree of June 24, 2021, and fear an increase in storage outside a substitution logic, which has been the guiding principle of the policy for rebalancing withdrawals."

It is located between the two main branches of the Rhine, the Waal on one side and the Lower Rhine and then the Lek on the other, which separate near Arnhem. The estuaries of the Waal and the Meuse cross the Biesbosch, a vast area of polders reclaimed by the sea during the Saint Elizabeth flood in 1421, near the city of Dordrecht. The Biesbosch thus forms a marshy buffer traversed by multiple small waterways, whose freezing occurs faster than in a vast estuary."

The Pannerden Canal, forming the section of the Lower Rhine at the division of the Rhine into two branches, freezes. As a result, a large portion of the Rhine's waters that were supposed to flow into the Lek is forced to pass through the Waal. In mid-January, the Waal's dikes give way in two places: at Lent, near Nijmegen, and at Loenen, a few kilometers downstream. The river's water pours inland like a torrent, destroying farms and villages. The bulk of the flooding is stopped by the Diefdijk, a dike crossing the Betuwe between Gorinchem, Leerdam, and Culemborg, thus forming a true inland sea. While the Betuwe is the hardest-hit region, floods occurred throughout the area between the Meuse and the Rhine, up to Arnhem. Starting on January 28, the King of Holland, Louis Bonaparte, travels to Gorinchem to assess the extent of the damage and support the affected populations. Louis himself helps reinforce the dikes with sandbags, coordinates relief efforts, and visits the most isolated villages in the area to encourage the population. To facilitate water drainage, the dike is breached at Dalem. These efforts are in vain as the Diefdijk also gives way on January 31 near Kedichem, and the flooding spreads across the entire Betuwe, reaching Alblasserdam. The damages are estimated by the Ministry of the Interior at 6 million florins."
