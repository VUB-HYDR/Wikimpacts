        "content": "The flood of the Piraí River in 1983, also known as The Great Flood of 1983, was a natural disaster that occurred in the early hours of March 18 of that year, mainly in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra and neighboring regions of the Santa Cruz department, in eastern Bolivia. In a study published in 2016, it is mentioned that there were actually two floods in 1983, the first on February 1 and the second on March 18. This event occurred due to the historic rise of the Piraí River, which flows west of the city of Santa Cruz. Due to torrential rain in the river's upper basin, it caused destruction along a stretch of more than 100 kilometers between the valleys and the alluvial plain, and as it advanced over flat terrain, the overflow reached a front about 10 kilometers wide, moving earth in its path. The flood destroyed the Tarumá bridge and wiped out the town of El Chorrito, in the municipality of El Torno, and reached Santa Cruz, flooding the botanical garden, the Ambrosio Villarroel neighborhood, and the entire western area of the city. The flood also caused hundreds of deaths and left 3,000 families homeless."

The population of General Roca was flooded between July 16 and 20. The flooding of the Negro River valleys occurred according to the varying altitudes of each depression. By July 20, news of the total destruction of Fort Pringles (now Guardia Mitre) and Fort San Javier reached Viedma. The town of General Conesa was completely submerged on July 23. Governor José Eugenio Tello ordered the construction of defensive embankments along the coastal area of the city of Viedma. However, on July 18, the city began to be attacked by the water. On July 21, at eight in the morning, the embankments ordered by the governor broke, and the waters advanced over the city. The government house was abandoned by employees in boats, and the prisoners from the jail were transferred to the Patagones police station. The residents who had remained in the city were rescued by vessels such as the Limay steamer. On July 25, the only building still standing was the Salesian College, which managed to withstand the waters. That same day, the flood reached parts of Patagones; however, the high areas of the city remained intact. On July 27, the waters reached their highest level, and only three days later, they began to recede. In addition to being flooded by the river, Viedma was primarily inundated by the El Juncal lagoon, a large body of water located behind the city, stretching from the Zanjón de Oyuela to near the mouth of the Negro River. After the flood, the capital of the territory began to rebuild, but the people of Viedma faced the great challenge of drying the lagoon. Its drainage and evaporation took until the 1930s."

        "content": "Around 3:45 PM on November 25, a partial breach occurred in the protective wall of the Tamarguillo stream at a location between the Carmona road and the current Kansas City Avenue, approximately near the Rafael Gordillo roundabout and very close to the La Corza neighborhood, which was the first area affected by the flood. This breach widened to about 50 meters. This initial breach was followed by two smaller ones, a few hours later, on the other side of the Carmona road. The first waters quickly reached the neighborhoods of La Corza, El Fontanal, Árbol Gordo, San José Obrero, Miraflores, and the entire northern part of the city from the Ronda de Capuchinos. Independently of this point, that same day, two other critical points emerged further south in the city. The first was caused by the overflow of the same Tamarguillo in an area near the Su Eminencia road, whose waters reached Cerro del Águila, Prado de San Sebastián, and María Luisa Park. The second occurred as a result of the overflow of the Guadaira River, with its waters merging with those of the Tamarguillo in María Luisa Park and reaching the Puerta de Jerez. During the night, an old Guadalquivir riverbed that ran from the Alameda de Hércules and La Campana to Plaza Nueva was flooded, with a maximum water level of three meters in the Alameda. On the morning of November 26, the flooding of the city reached its maximum extent. On Monday, the 27th, water levels began to slightly decrease, and by Tuesday, the improvement was noticeable, revealing the damage caused by the water. That afternoon, the main breach in the Tamarguillo was sealed. No official end date for the Tamarguillo flood was given, but as of November 30, water still remained in some neighborhoods. It has been estimated that the approximate volume of water that flooded the capital was 4,000,000 m³, reaching a height of three to four meters in the most affected areas. According to official figures, the flooded area was 552 hectares, one-third of the total city, and affected 150,000 residents to varying degrees. More recent investigations have increased the number of affected hectares to 3,448, a surface area about six times larger than the official data."

It departed from Madrid on December 18 and arrived in Seville the following day amid great anticipation.  \nAs it entered the city, a small plane accompanying the caravan became entangled with high-voltage cables and crashed into the large crowd waiting for its passage. The accident resulted in twenty fatalities and over one hundred injuries."

During the heavy rain, the government of the Republic of China urgently established the Central Disaster Response Center. The areas with the heaviest rainfall were in the southern mountainous regions. The accumulated rainfall from this heavy rain event was second only to the 2009 Typhoon Morakot disaster. The main period of impact from this heavy rain event was from August 6 to August 8, 2021, resulting in 4 deaths and approximately NT$742.43 million in agricultural losses."

        "content": "On the afternoon of August 4, the Central Weather Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation issued a sea typhoon warning for Tropical Storm Lupit, located northwest of Dongsha Island, and announced plans to issue a land typhoon warning for Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu the following afternoon. On August 5, the Central Weather Bureau stated that due to Lupit making landfall along the Guangdong coast of mainland China, its intensity slightly weakened, and its storm circle showed signs of shrinking. As a result, the typhoon warning was lifted at 5:30 PM. During the warning period, the Central Disaster Response Center was activated at Level 2, and a price stabilization mechanism for daily necessities was implemented. \n\nOn the evening of August 5, meteorological data showed that Lupit's outer circulation brought southwesterly moisture, causing significant wind and rain in the outlying islands and southern Taiwan. The Central Weather Bureau indicated that Lupit, downgraded to a tropical depression, would bring southwesterly airflow to western Taiwan as it moved northeastward. Peng Qiming, General Manager of Weather Risk Management Development Co., noted that Lupit had a well-structured moisture system extending 800 kilometers, with strong convection in the center accompanied by lightning. Central Weather Bureau Director Cheng Ming-dian also pointed out that the airflow axis was over the Taiwan Strait but had already significantly impacted Taiwan's western coastal areas.\n\nSubsequently, at 10 AM on August 6, the Central Weather Bureau issued a tropical depression advisory for Lupit, which was located 70 kilometers west of Kinmen and moving northeastward at a speed of 7 kilometers per hour. Later that afternoon, President Tsai Ing-wen announced that the central government planned to further activate the \"Flood Disaster Central Disaster Response Center\" that evening. The Central Weather Bureau stated that Lupit might strengthen again after moving into the northern waters of Taiwan, leaving open the possibility of reissuing a typhoon warning. At 5:30 PM that day, the bureau initiated \"large-scale or severe heavy rain operations.\"\n\nUltimately, during Lupit's impact on Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau recorded a maximum wind speed of only 15 meters per second in Penghu, and no weather station on Taiwan's main island reached the wind speed threshold. Scientifically, this was insufficient to classify it as a tropical storm, and the bureau maintained its classification as a tropical depression. After Lupit moved out to sea near Taiwan's northeastern coast, the Central Weather Bureau reported that it had re-strengthened into a tropical storm. At a forecast press conference, the bureau also stated that the combined effects of Lupit and the southwesterly airflow brought abundant moisture to Taiwan, warning all regions to be vigilant against disaster-causing rainfall."

On the afternoon of the 5th at 3:30 PM, the Council of Agriculture issued a heavy rain and landslide warning, indicating that 60 potential landslide streams were under red alert, 94 under yellow alert, with 1 large-scale landslide area under red alert and another under yellow alert [19]. On the same day, the Coast Guard evacuated 539 people, 213 vehicles, and 19 boats from the shore [20]. Due to the influence of Lupit's outer circulation and the southwest airflow, Uni Air and Mandarin Airlines announced on the 6th that domestic flights for the following day would be adjusted, with several island flights canceled or rescheduled [21]. \n\nIn the early hours of the 7th, a squall line from Lupit and the southwest airflow began moving from the Taiwan Strait toward Taiwan's mainland [22]. Lupit's center made landfall in the Hsinchu and Taoyuan areas on the morning of the 7th [23], marking the first recorded instance in meteorological history of a tropical cyclone making landfall in mainland China and then in Taiwan [24]. Heavy rainfall in Taiwan persisted, causing disruptions to the Taiwan Railway, where fallen trees between Houli and Fengyuan blocked the tracks, halting services from 6:30 AM until resuming at 9:12 AM [25]. Taiwan High-Speed Rail also suspended operations between Miaoli and Taichung from 12 PM due to a landslide in the Tongxiao section at 8:07 AM [26][27]. Taiwan Power Company reported that some power poles and lines were crushed by landslides and road collapses, with cables washed away by floods, resulting in power outages for approximately 93,066 households [28]. In Dahu Township, Miaoli County, a landfill was destroyed, burying 2 recycling trucks and 4 garbage trucks [29]. In Fengshan District, Kaohsiung City, an abandoned house on Guangyuan Road collapsed after being struck by lightning. The Kaohsiung City Public Works Bureau's illegal construction handling team promptly demolished the collapsed structure [30]. In Liugui District, a landslide entered a residential house, prompting the Fourth Combat Zone of the Republic of China Armed Forces to assist with post-disaster recovery, including clearing mud and debris and cleaning the environment [31]. In Taitung City, Taitung County, the \"Beinan River Water Cover Area\" dust prevention measure was completely destroyed by rising river water. After inspecting and assessing the Zhonghua Bridge over the Beinan River, multiple excavators were immediately deployed for emergency repairs [32]. \n\nThe Directorate General of Highways of the Ministry of Transportation reported at 12 PM on the 7th that road disasters included 9 preemptive closures, 10 blocked sections, and 9 damaged sections [33]. The main road disasters occurred on Provincial Highway 27, with multiple landslides causing interruptions [34]. On Provincial Highway 8, the Central Cross-Island Highway experienced fallen trees and scattered rocks [35]. The most severe damage was on Provincial Highway 20, where the Mingba Kelu Bridge in Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung City, was washed away [36]. The section near Shengjing Bridge to Taoyuan No. 1 Bridge was also impassable due to landslides, and a road collapse occurred at the 68-kilometer mark from Laonong to Jiaxian [37]. In the mountainous areas of Miaoli County, continuous heavy rain caused landslides, with a small truck in Zhuolan Township on Provincial Highway 3 struck by falling rocks [38]. In Chiayi County, 21 people were stranded for six days due to a road collapse on the access road to the Alishan Youth Activity Center [39]. \n\nThe outer circulation of Lupit and the southwest airflow led to the evacuation of 302 people in Majia Township, Pingtung County [40], and 152 people in Laiyi Township [41]. In Kaohsiung City's mountainous areas, 2,035 people were forcibly evacuated [42]. In Ren'ai Township, Nantou County, a couple fishing under a bridge drowned due to rising river water [43]. In Meinong District, Kaohsiung City, a man repairing water pipes on a mountain fell into a valley and died [44]. In Tainan City, three people jogging on the north breakwater of Anping Port were swept off the breakwater by rogue waves, resulting in one fatality [45]. \n\nThe Central Weather Bureau lifted the \"large-scale or severe heavy rain operation\" at 8:30 PM on the 7th [46]. The Council of Agriculture reported at 9:30 PM that 368 potential landslide streams were under red alert, 157 under yellow alert, with 4 large-scale landslide areas under red alert and 1 under yellow alert [47]. \n\nOn the 8th, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai visited the Qinhe section by land to inspect the disaster situation along the newly opened Gao 133 route in Liugui, the sheltering conditions in Taoyuan, and the large-scale landslide restoration work in the Maolin Wanshan area [48]. Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Luo Dasheng also inspected road damage in Shanlin and Jiaxian Districts on the same day, instructing the city government team and district offices to ensure disaster relief and reconstruction work [49]. Pingtung County Magistrate Pan Meng-an inspected the Sandimen New Bridge, which had reported cracks the previous day [50]. After observation and inspection by engineers, the bridge structure was deemed safe and reopened [51]. The following day, Premier Su Tseng-chang visited Pingtung, where he pledged to assist in resolving land acquisition issues for the flood detention pond project at Tajen University on Taiwan Sugar Corporation land [52]."

It had to remain at the harbor entrance until the tide rose. Subsequently, the ship ran aground on the northern breakwater of Budai Commercial Port. All nine crew members were evacuated, but due to poor sea conditions, oil extraction and other operations could not be carried out. The rescue team planned to conduct oil extraction and salvage operations on the afternoon of August 8. However, due to the difficulty of moving the ship, the shipping company decided to dismantle it on-site. The responsible maritime company estimated that the process would take at least 70 working days. The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the incident and found that the ship's log for the day of the accident and the previous day was not recorded, violating the safety management documents of Hai Sheng Company. They also noted that the Budai Management Office of the Taiwan International Ports Corporation's Kaohsiung Branch had not implemented control measures based on the safety improvement recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board after the previous Shengli ship incident.  \n\nOn August 8, rainfall across Taiwan gradually eased. The Central Disaster Response Center held its fifth work meeting at 11 a.m. and returned to the respective ministries' response mechanisms at 11:30 a.m. According to data compiled by the Agriculture and Food Agency of the Council of Agriculture from reports by various municipalities and county governments, the heavy rain event caused an estimated loss of approximately NT$742.43 million in agricultural products and private facilities. Before the impact of Tropical Storm Lupit on Taiwan, the Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs carried out water release and flood discharge operations for reservoirs with high sedimentation levels, such as Zengwen Reservoir and Wushantou Reservoir. On August 5, the Water Resources Agency also announced that, due to the influence of Typhoon In-Fa, Tropical Storm Lupit, and the southwest monsoon, Taiwan's water conditions had returned to normal, and the drought emergency response team, which had been in place for 324 days, was disbanded.  \n\nThe Dajia River Power Plant reported that as of 7 a.m. on August 8, the water level of the Deji Reservoir had reached 1,395.7 meters, with a storage volume of 140.58 million cubic meters, an increase of 17.18 million cubic meters from the previous day, marking the largest single-day increase in storage volume that year. The Southern Region Water Resources Office of the Water Resources Agency also noted that the Mudan Reservoir received a cumulative rainfall of 506 millimeters and a total inflow of 42.36 million cubic meters over the 10 days affected, approximately 1.6 times the reservoir's capacity."

However, after Vice Mayor Lin Chin-jung inspected the site, he ordered the road to be paved by 5:30 a.m., saying, \"Otherwise, heads will roll!\" Former Kaohsiung City Information Bureau Director Cheng Chao-hsin criticized Lin's remarks on Facebook, stating, \"During my time serving in the Kaohsiung City Government, I only saw colleagues working together with high morale, and I never saw Mayor Han threatening to 'take someone's head' to make a point.\" Mayor Chen Chi-mai of Kaohsiung defended Lin, saying that Lin, as a former Public Works Bureau director, likely wanted the work to be completed quickly out of deep care and responsibility.\n\nIn response, Kuomintang (KMT) Kaohsiung City Councilor Huang Shao-ting criticized, \"After being labeled as the capital of deteriorating public safety, is Kaohsiung now becoming the city of sinkholes?\" Mayor Chen Chi-mai replied that after the heavy rain, road repairs and leveling had already begun to ensure safer roads, emphasizing that this work is ongoing. The \"WeCare Kaohsiung\" Facebook page, which successfully campaigned to recall Han Kuo-yu, listed 13 news reports of sinkholes during Han's tenure as mayor, claiming that his achievements in flood control and road maintenance were self-aggrandizing myths. This prompted netizens to counter by listing nine sinkhole incidents that occurred after Chen Chi-mai took office.\n\nKMT Chairman candidate Eric Chu, commenting on Kaohsiung's flooding issues, stated that many citizens had praised former Deputy Mayor Li Si-chuan of Han Kuo-yu's administration for doing an excellent job and suggested that Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) councilors and legislators should reflect on why \"Uncle Chuan\" could achieve results while the current administration cannot. In response, former Taichung City Government Information Bureau Director Chuo Kuan-ting and DPP Kaohsiung City Councilor Chiu Chun-hsien criticized Chu's remarks, accusing him of turning flood control into political rhetoric. DPP Legislator Hsu Chih-chieh further criticized Chu, saying, \"For the sake of your party chairman election, there's no need to create blue-green division by posting a photo of Kaohsiung on Facebook, especially when you might not even know the exact location in the picture.\""

Taipei City Councilor Lo Chih-chiang of the Kuomintang criticized President Tsai Ing-wen, saying, \"She seeks attention during the Olympics but disappears during floods!\" He stated that cheering for the Olympics is understandable, but the heavy rains and flooding in central and southern Taiwan should not be ignored. Legislator Ann Kao of the Taiwan People's Party also commented, \"The NT$250.7 billion water environment budget is largely spent on beautifying the environment and creating waterfront spaces, rather than solving water management issues or improving flood prevention standards.\" She further criticized, \"After enduring a drought, we now face floods and inundation. So where exactly has the Tsai administration spent all this money?\" In response, Premier Su Tseng-chang retorted, \"This is an amateurish statement,\" and explained that the water management budget is not solely for flood control but also includes water supply facilities. Regarding Ann Kao's remarks, Su further stated that the rainfall during the period reached 1,100 millimeters in a single day, which is unbearable for anyone, adding, \"People should be more humble and not always go against the environment.\" Ann Kao countered, \"That makes it even more necessary to spend money wisely and not on landscaping projects for ribbon-cutting ceremonies by officials.\" Chen Szu-yu, director of the office of Legislator Chiu Chen-yuan of the Taiwan People's Party, also raised doubts, pointing out that the highest rainfall in Taiwan was 1,084 millimeters in Pingtung County, not the 1,100 millimeters mentioned by Su, and criticized Su for mistakenly referring to \"1,084 millimeters\" as \"1,084 centimeters,\" which drew criticism from netizens. The Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the government, through the Forward-looking Water Environment Program, has constructed many water management facilities. Although the power of climate change cannot be entirely prevented by engineering, the measures have reduced flooding areas and accelerated water recession. On the 12th, during an Executive Yuan meeting on the \"0807 Flood Disaster Status and Recovery,\" Premier Su Tseng-chang instructed that the government had invested a total of NT$176 billion in water environment construction under the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program for stable water supply and flood control.

        "content": "In the southeast of Buenos Aires, it began to rain heavily on April 20, 1980, marking the start of a period of intense rainfall across much of the territory. In this area, in just eight days, about 30 billion tons of water fell. In Necochea, the rainfall reached 414 mm. Naturally, the water channeled into the river, seeking an outlet to the sea using the Quequén River's course. By the end of April, the river began to overflow, and its course became uncontrollable. This caused residents living along the banks of the Quequén River to start evacuating their homes. By April 28, the waters covered the entire riverbank and submerged houses, schools, and clubs; even the bus terminal had to be evacuated due to the flooding."

        "content": "Beyond the houses and other constructions flooded for days along the banks of the Quequén River, various types of damage occurred in the cities, the countryside, and the road infrastructure. In the rural area, it is estimated that during this storm, 40% of the province of Buenos Aires was affected. In total, it is estimated that about 22,500 farms—large, medium, and small—were affected, with the latter two being the most impacted. The cities of Necochea and Quequén were especially affected by the destruction of the Ignacio Ezcurra Bridge, which was located near the river's mouth and the Port of Quequén, where a central section approximately 130 meters long collapsed. This bridge has not been rebuilt since then. That same day, the old railway bridge, which had been closed since 1966 and led to the Necochea station, also collapsed. Due to the strong pressure and force of the swollen river, the port was also affected. The advancing water, carrying logs, dead animals, furniture, and other debris, caused serious damage, undermining the old docks and embankments. In the port area, the grain conveyor belts of the National Grain Board were destroyed, rendering docks unusable and leaving the port inactive due to the blockage of the access channel caused by the accumulation of debris carried by the river's current to the mouth at the sea. Several vessels' moorings were also severed, leaving them adrift at sea. Of these, at least three sank, and several others ran aground in the following days along the Quequén coast. The Pesquera II, a mid-sized fishing vessel docked at the Port of Quequén, was torn away and carried by the current to the outer harbor, where it listed and sank, with no crew on board. A similar fate befell the Pesquera III, a mid-sized Soviet-made fishing vessel. Like the previous one, it was torn from the port and dragged to the Bahía de los Vientos beach, where it ran aground. On the same date, the fishing vessel Anna C also sank in the port's access channel. Meanwhile, the Caribea, which had been immobilized in the port due to legal issues since 1978, was dragged and stranded near the Colonia Pinocho in Quequén. In the outer harbor, the Pesquera II, Santa Elena I, Santa Rosa, the coastal vessel San Cayetano II, and the factory ship Knossos were stranded and severely damaged. The impact of the flood also had long-term consequences, as it caused a rupture in the tourism, port, and social dynamics, which remain disrupted due to the never-completed reconstruction of the Ezcurra Bridge."

The probability of this disturbance developing into a typhoon was low, and it moved slowly over the Taiwan Strait, bringing severe weather to central and southern Taiwan. Rainfall worsened starting on the 10th, and the Central Weather Bureau issued heavy rain and torrential rain warnings for nine counties and cities that afternoon. By 6:55 PM, the warnings were expanded to 10 counties and cities, with Chiayi County upgraded to an extremely heavy rain warning.

In Fanlu Township, Zhongpu Township, Xingang Township, and Shuishang Township, accumulated rainfall also exceeded 200 millimeters. As the rain intensified after nightfall, a mudslide occurred in Wenfeng Village, Zhuqi Township, burying a mourning household's residence. The coffin of the deceased could not be moved in time and was buried in the debris, only to be found at 10:50 a.m. on the 11th. In Chiayi City, a wooden house at the intersection of Lanjing Street and Xingzhong Street collapsed due to the heavy rain, crushing several vendor carts. In Zhongpu Township, Chiayi County, an outdoor banquet scene showed people still enjoying the feast despite the flooding. In the same township, a car was swept into a field, trapping two people who were later rescued. At the Yongqin No. 2 Bridge in Chiayi County, several vehicles were submerged and trapped in water. Firefighters deployed rubber boats for rescue operations, saving a total of 32 people. Near the Yongqin No. 2 Bridge, the Wujidehua Hall was flooded to about the height of the first floor. The Chiayi City Fire Department rescued three trapped individuals and, along the way, saved three more people awaiting rescue at Xingfu Ranch.\n\nAt 7:12 a.m. on the 11th, police and firefighters discovered a couple dead inside a van under the bridge of Chiayi Route 175 crossing Taiwan Route 82 in Shuishang Township, Chiayi County. It was determined that the couple drowned after their vehicle stalled and could not be restarted due to flooding. It was not until noon that the Directorate General of Highways announced the reopening of two-way traffic on Taiwan Route 82, while the mud and debris on Chiayi Route 175 were cleared by the Chiayi County Government and Shuishang Township Office before traffic resumed. Shuishang Township Mayor Lin Xiangting stated that the flooding in Geqiliao and the nearby Hongwa Village in Chiayi City's West District was severe, with water gushing out of manhole covers. She criticized Chiayi City for being \"selfish\" by discharging water into Shuishang Township. In response, the Chiayi City Government explained that mobile pumps had been deployed to assist with drainage since four years ago, but the cross-section of the Nanjing drainage system passing through Taiwan Route 1 and the railway was too small and still required improvement. Chiayi County Magistrate Weng Changliang conducted a disaster inspection on the 11th with township mayors and Executive Yuan policy advisor Chen Guanting, promising to permanently install pumps in Geqiliao, Shuishang Township, to discharge water into the Tougang branch line. Local residents expressed dissatisfaction with Chen Guanting, a Democratic Progressive Party candidate for the 2024 Legislative Yuan election, for inspecting the disaster site, while independent legislative candidate Lin Guoqing was absent. They criticized Lin's election approach, saying, \"Ignoring the people's suffering is outrageous and infuriating.\"\n\nOn the 11th, the Chiayi County Government held a work meeting for the \"0910 Heavy Rain Disaster Response Center\" to address the disaster situation. Magistrate Weng Changliang stated that the meteorological forecast predicted only 70 millimeters of rainfall, but the actual rainfall exceeded 200 millimeters, leading to an inadequate response. He pledged to improve warning efficiency. The heavy rain caused the drowning of 60,000 egg-laying chickens at a livestock farm in Shuishang Township, and hundreds of pigs also perished in the flood. According to preliminary statistics from the Chiayi County Agriculture Department on September 12, the agricultural losses from this heavy rain event amounted to approximately NT$30,275,000."

A meeting of principals from national high schools and vocational schools in Chiayi City decided at 2 a.m. on the 11th to suspend classes but not work. However, Chiayi City Government's Director of Education, Kuo Tien-Tsai, stated that junior high and elementary schools would operate as usual, sparking criticism and complaints from residents. In response, Chiayi City Mayor Huang Min-Hui stated, \"The shared living circle of the county and city is one of the considerations for suspending work and classes, but there are other aspects to consider. High schools and vocational schools also have their own considerations, and they report to the K-12 Education Administration of the Ministry of Education.

The cause of these floods was a series of stationary convective storms caused by moisture from the intertropical convergence zone (with anomalous activity due to the 2023-2024 El Niño Event) carried by an atmospheric river along a frontal shear line associated with a deep trough at all levels of the atmosphere that was located over the Dominican Republic. The torrential rains and severe flooding affected the entire country, but mainly Greater Santo Domingo (which received a record 431 mm of rain), the Lower Yuna Valley, Independencia Province, Montecristi, and San Pedro de Macorís. A significant event was the collapse of the lining of the tunnel on February 27 Avenue in Santo Domingo, which crushed several vehicles.

This phenomenon was expected to generate significant rainfall accumulations in the country, between 120 and 170 millimeters. Despite its potential, no cyclonic development occurred, and the alerts were discontinued by the National Hurricane Center. However, the moisture flow was associated with a trough, resulting in a stationary storm line that caused torrential rains between the night of November 17 and the early hours of November 19. On November 18, the floods caused by the weather system affected the Dominican Republic, causing various tragedies, including the collapse of bridges and the overflowing of rivers. In Greater Santo Domingo, flash floods inundated entire neighborhoods, swept away vehicles, and caused the collapse of the tunnel on February 27 Avenue. In the Bajo Yuna area, 2,927 families remain isolated due to flooding caused by the overflow of the Yuna River. At least one person died when a vehicle was swept away by the strong water current in the lower Yuna River area. In San José de Ocoa, the floods caused the collapse of houses in the Los Ranchitos sector.

The Xingtai authorities responded, stating that the only upstream reservoir, Dongchuankou Reservoir, is an open-type reservoir where discharge cannot be controlled, and there is no issue of human scheduling of the discharge. The floodwaters entering Qili River came from two sources: one from the overflow of Dongchuankou Reservoir and interval inflows, and the other from the flood diversion channel in Xingtai's urban area. These two sources converged to form a major flood. Additionally, the sudden narrowing of Qili River at Daxian Bridge caused the flood to overflow the banks and breach, leading to water entering villages in the development zone.\n\nAround the time of the Spring Festival, Xingtai City began a centralized urban heating project. The construction unit, in order to allow the heating pipeline to pass through Qili River, piled the excavated soil in front of Daxian Bridge to build a dam, blocking the river channel horizontally. The original earthen dam was also removed and piled into the river channel. The Xingtai flood control department had twice urged the clearing of the river channel, but the construction unit failed to act in time. Many villagers believe that the lack of local flood control awareness, the removal of the dam, the blockage of the river channel, and the near-filling of the bridge opening were the main reasons why the upstream floodwaters suddenly surged near Daxian Village and rushed into the villages.\n\nAfter the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government workgroup arrived in Xingtai, they reviewed relevant meteorological data and conducted on-site inspections of the Qili River channel, the breach site, and the upstream Dongchuankou Reservoir. They preliminarily concluded that the breach of Qili River on the night of July 19 was caused by a flood peak formed by localized heavy rainfall rather than human factors."

Villagers stated that apart from a broadcast warning about half an hour before the flood entered the village, they did not receive any other warnings. An official from the Water Resources Bureau of the Xingtai Economic Development Zone said in a media interview that the development zone did not receive a notice from the higher-level flood control office to evacuate residents from the night of July 19 to the early morning of July 20. Meanwhile, an official from the Xingtai City Flood Control and Drought Relief Command Office stated that the city flood control office did issue an evacuation notice to the economic development zone at that time but could not recall the specific time. On July 23, the deputy mayor of Xingtai City stated at a press conference that the city flood control office notified the development zone to organize the evacuation of residents at 1:40 a.m. on July 20, and the relevant departments of the development zone immediately entered Daxian Village. Multiple villagers in Daxian Village reported to the media that during the approximately seven hours from the early morning of July 20, when the flood entered the village, until around noon that day, rescue forces were slow to arrive, and most of the rescue work was organized spontaneously by villagers after the floodwaters receded slightly. In response, the head of the Xingtai Municipal Party Committee's External Publicity Office stated in an interview with reporters that rescue forces rushed to the disaster area immediately after the flood broke out, \"It was definitely notified in time to evacuate, but the specific rescue situation is not yet clear.\""

This event occurred due to an isolated depression at high levels (DANA), which caused intense rainfall in the region, estimated at more than a thousand liters per square meter in a few hours. The overflowing waters of the Segura flooded much of the valley, causing severe damage in towns such as Murcia, Orihuela, Molíns, Algorfa, Almoradí, Benijófar, Rojales, and Guardamar del Segura. The impact of the flood was devastating. It is estimated that at least a thousand people died, mainly in areas located near the riverbed, due to the collapse of houses and the sweeping away of people by the strong current."

        "content": "On the night of Saturday, October 14, an intense storm surprised the city's population while they slept. Unlike previous occasions, there was no time for a general alert or the activation of a parish emergency organization, and the defenses, already weakened by a previous flood on September 20, were in critical condition. The force of this flood far exceeded the previous one, breaking the dikes and defensive structures that still remained. The storm began to unleash its force at three in the morning. Shortly after, the waters of the Segura, Mula, Guadalentín rivers, and the Nogalte and Sangonera ravines converged, increasing the flow of the Segura River and causing a violent surge that swept away everything in its path. The current broke dikes and the river's weir, in addition to causing severe damage to the Malecón. Buildings located near the river were flooded, forcing the evacuation of several convents, such as San Agustín and those of the nuns of Verónica and the Mother of God. The material damage was immense. In Murcia, the flood destroyed the parishes of San Antolín, Santa Eulalia, San Juan, San Lorenzo, San Miguel, and San Andrés, and demolished hundreds of houses. The cathedral also suffered the onslaught of the waters, which entered during the celebration of a mass, forcing the officiant to take refuge in the tower with the Blessed Sacrament. Although nearly a thousand deaths were reported, mainly in neighborhoods and hamlets near the river's course, other estimates suggest that the deaths numbered several hundred. The waters reached heights of up to three stadia, remaining at that level for hours. At nine in the morning, after a brief respite in the rains, the river level continued to rise until three in the afternoon, that is, twelve hours after the storm began."

        "header": "Consequences",
        "content": "Once the flood had subsided, the Murcia City Council focused on two urgent priorities: repairing the city's defenses to prevent a future catastrophe and cleaning the water and mud accumulated in the streets. The presence of stagnant water raised concerns about possible outbreaks of diseases. During the first three days after the flood, the water level remained high, and although it later began to recede, the city's streets remained flooded due to a change in the course of the Segura River, which now flowed through the city via the broken weir. To divert the water flow, a commission was sent, which decided to break the counter-weir on October 28, helping to drain the city. The repair of the Malecón, one of the key defenses, was essential. To ensure its prompt reconstruction, the City Council required all citizens to participate in the work or hire someone to do it on their behalf, with jurors organizing the work groups. This order caused discontent among the hidalgos, who resisted performing physical labor, claiming that their privileges exempted them from such obligations. However, the City Council responded that, in the face of the emergency, no one was exempt, as there were no \"privileges to avoid the risks and damages of the flood.\" Even the Count of Castro and other councilors hired people in their place to support the work. To reassure the nobility, the City Council clarified that participating in the reconstruction of the dyke did not harm their privileges, as it was a \"virtue\" in service of the public good and the protection of the city. This act reflects a more modern perspective of the time: although the system of privileges was accepted and defended, in the face of extreme necessity, the common good could prevail, albeit without affecting the essence of those privileges. Among the testimonies of the time is that of María Ángela Astorch, a Barcelonan nun of converso origin and abbess of the Capuchins of Murcia, who described in detail the effects of the flood in a memorial addressed to King Philip IV. In her writing, Astorch denounced the state of ruin and misery in which the region had been left. The flood occurred at a critical moment, as the Segura Valley was recovering from a deep economic crisis, worsened by the expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609. However, despite the magnitude of the tragedy, the Spanish Crown did not allocate aid for the recovery of the territory."

        "content": "The heat wave in Argentina in December 2013 was a phenomenon that occurred from December 11, 2013, to January 2, 2014, in the northern and central regions of the country, as well as in the northern part of Patagonia. It was the second longest heat wave experienced in Argentina since records began in 1906, affecting at least 52 cities across the country. For the first time since the creation of the heat alarm system, a red-level alert was in effect for several consecutive days both in the city of Buenos Aires and in the city of Rosario in Santa Fe. The cause of this heat wave was the Madden-Julian oscillation, which caused the South Atlantic anticyclone to settle over the continent, creating an atmospheric blockage that led to high temperatures and scarce precipitation in the central and northern parts of the country, while halting subpolar and subtropical frontal systems, resulting in unusual summer snowfalls in Tierra del Fuego and torrential rains in Brazil."

        "content": "Starting from December 11, a marked increase in temperatures began to be recorded, especially the maximums, in a vast area of the central and northern Patagonian region, affecting southern Córdoba, southern Santa Fe, southern Entre Ríos, a large part of the province of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, eastern Mendoza, eastern Neuquén, and Río Negro. From the 19th, this anomalous situation began to expand towards northern Argentina and intensified again over the central part, affecting 18 provinces, subsiding around December 30 in the central part and between January 1 and 2 in the extreme north of the country with the passage of a cold front that caused a change in the air mass. As a result, most localities located between 30°S and 40°S recorded 1 or 2 heatwaves during the period, with durations ranging from 5 to 18 consecutive days, and average minimum temperatures exceeding 4°C and average maximum temperatures exceeding 6°C compared to the normal for the season. The long persistence of this heatwave (22 days) made the event exceptional, breaking several records regarding the highest number of consecutive days with minimum and maximum temperatures above the average in several meteorological stations in the affected area. The National Meteorological Service reported, through its daily updates, information on the development of the heatwave. Meteorological agencies in Uruguay and Paraguay also declared a state of alert due to the heatwave."

        "content": "It was the first heat wave whose health hazard level was categorized as extreme (red alert). The National Meteorological Service and the Ministry of Health warned the population of the cities and surrounding areas of Buenos Aires and Rosario about the risks to avoid and the basic precautions to follow in the face of intense heat. This occurs in exceptional cases of heat waves, which can affect all healthy people, not just at-risk groups. Up to that point, several deaths had been recorded with heat stroke episodes as direct causes of death. In Santiago del Estero, eleven deaths associated with heat stroke occurred. In Entre Ríos, seven more cases were reported, largely due to cardiorespiratory arrests and decompensations caused by the intense heat, as well as one fatality from heat stroke in the district of Avellaneda, and in the province of Salta, one fatality was reported due to sunstroke. In various locations, several drownings were also recorded (largely due to thermal shock) as several people attempted to cool off in some rivers in the provinces of Córdoba (9 cases), Santa Fe (4 cases), Buenos Aires (5 cases), Entre Ríos (4 cases), Mendoza (3 cases), Corrientes (4 cases), San Luis (1 case), Salta (1 case), Santiago del Estero (1 case), and Jujuy (1 case). In the city of Buenos Aires, two people died from carbon monoxide poisoning after turning on a generator to alleviate the intense nighttime heat. The following day, a similar case occurred, where a 50-year-old man lost his life for the same reason, and several days later, an elderly person was found dead in their apartment in the Villa del Parque neighborhood due to power outages and the intense heat. In the district of Avellaneda, three people died in a fire while trying to light the place with candles since they had no electricity due to power outages. Meanwhile, for the same reason, four people died in a house fire in Quilmes, and one more person in the city of Buenos Aires. In the city of Pergamino, an elderly person also fell victim to a fire caused by an electrical failure in a ventilation device. Also in the city, SAME recorded a peak in emergency calls; most of the emergencies were related to fainting and low blood pressure, typical symptoms of heat stroke, and because pre-existing health conditions worsened, such as the emergence of a dengue outbreak in a region as southern as the province of Entre Ríos, a large province where such disease (dengue in Argentina is almost always a zoonosis carried by people who have previously been in much more northern areas than Argentina). In Rosario, 70 swimmers cooling off in the Paraná River on Christmas Day were attacked by a school of piranhas, carnivorous fish of the genus Serrasalmus —to which piranhas also belong—. These fish were fleeing to cooler areas due to the high water temperatures caused by the heat wave. The following day, another attack by these fish occurred at a beach on the Paraná River in Posadas (Misiones), injuring 15 people."

Between December 21 and 27, the number of users without electricity service fluctuated between 50,000 and 70,000. On December 23, the Ministry of Federal Planning reported that the Argentine Interconnection System broke the power demand record when consumption peaked at 23,793 megawatts. Power outages also occurred in cities in the interior of the country, such as Córdoba, Rosario, and San Miguel de Tucumán. On December 23, the Argentine Interconnection System recorded a power demand record for a weekday, with electricity consumption peaking at 23,793 megawatts at 2:20 PM. Additionally, on December 28, it recorded a power demand record for a Saturday, with electricity consumption reaching 21,264 megawatts at 2:10 PM. As a consequence of the relentless heat, there were heavy rains with strong electrical activity in several localities in the central part of the country, and San Miguel de Tucumán experienced high wind activity. On New Year's Eve, the city of Rosario experienced a heat index of 55°C."

        "content": "On December 23, Buenos Aires legislator Marcelo Ramal presented a bill for an electricity emergency in the City of Buenos Aires. This initial project proposed the creation of a crisis committee composed of: one representative from each legislative bloc, representatives from the consultative councils of the Communes and affected neighborhoods, elected representatives of workers and technicians from energy distributors, and academics from the Faculty of Engineering at UBA. The committee would have authority over the distribution companies and would organize an energy restoration operation. The project included the formation of 60 emergency crews (4 per commune) to repair damaged lines and substations, as well as the provision of 1,500 generators (100 per commune). The costs related to these operations would be financed through a tax on gambling establishments in the City, which are currently exempt. However, only five legislators (in addition to Ramal, Gustavo Vera, Virginia González Gass, Pablo Bergel, and Alejandro Bodart, the latter two with their own projects) signed the request for the Legislature to hold a special session to address this issue. The project was ignored by the remaining legislators, prompting the five signatories to hold a press conference. Chief of Staff Jorge Capitanich pointed to the electricity providers, Edenor and Edesur, as responsible for the outages and urged users to direct their complaints to the companies. He announced an administrative holiday for December 30 starting at 12 p.m. Working groups were created within the framework of the climate emergency, unifying the tasks of security forces (police, army, civil defense, and firefighters) with the availability of 500 patrol cars, 17,000 agents, and 3,200 cameras. Days later, the head of government of the City of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, declared an energy emergency due to the energy collapse affecting his city. Similarly, Capitanich announced the executive branch's intention to nationalize the management of the electricity service if Edenor and Edesur did not resolve the supply issues. When asked about Nicolás Caputo, a shareholder in Edesur and the main beneficiary of public works in Buenos Aires, responsible for the power outages, he avoided responding or referencing the responsibility of energy distribution companies like Edesur, owned by his close friend with whom he shares business interests. As a result of the prolonged power outages, numerous protests occurred due to public discontent in most neighborhoods of the City of Buenos Aires, disrupting traffic on streets, highways, and bridges. One of the most affected roadways by the protests was the Buenos Aires-La Plata Highway, where a total vehicle collapse was recorded. In the city, there were various demonstrations by residents, including street and avenue blockades. By the first days of January 2014, some neighborhoods in the City of Buenos Aires had been without electricity for more than two weeks, leading residents to block the Sarmiento railway line as a form of protest, as well as in the Province of Buenos Aires. Ramal, the author of the law proposing the energy emergency, criticized Macri's measure, considering that \"what Macri did is a caricature of an energy emergency, not a real emergency,\" as \"no extraordinary measures were taken to restore the service nor resources allocated to address an emergency.\" The national and city governments agreed to coordinate assistance tasks for residents who remained without power. Mauricio Macri himself requested a change in the time zone for the City of Buenos Aires, the Argentine coast, and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Córdoba. The National Minister of Planning, Julio De Vido, strongly rejected the proposal, explaining that \"having two time zones would cause disruptions and costs greater than the benefits, as it would not be logical, for example, to have one time in Córdoba and another in Santiago del Estero.\" The planning minister then asked \"Argentine companies\" with shares in Edesur to \"take responsibility as Argentines\" for the power outages. \"I am referring to the Caputo Group, Escasany Group, Miguens Bemberg Group, Guillermo Reca, and Guillermo Vázquez.\""

        "content": "Edenor and Edesur companies have been identified as responsible for the outages. It was publicly reported that the companies under-executed investments for which they had resources amounting to 240 million pesos, through the Infrastructure Fund, \"as a form of extortion to achieve a tariff increase.\" The planning minister warned that, due to \"negligence and serious non-compliance\" in service during the heatwave, the distribution companies would have to pay 490 pesos to residential users who were without power for 12 to 24 hours. Edesur was required to compensate users with a total of 221 million pesos, while Edenor had to compensate them with 77 million. After the outages caused by the heatwave, starting in 2014, Edenor initiated an investment plan that allowed a 32% reduction in outages."

In France, in the Var region, 6,300 hectares have burned, leading to the evacuation of 7,000 people. Additionally, the fires have caused the death of 2 people. In Finland, the region bordering the Kalajoki River has experienced the worst forest fires since 1971. In August 2021, Finland reported about 12.5 times more burned forests since the beginning of the year compared to the average established over the period 2008-2020 (488 ha, instead of 39 ha per year).

In this initial stage, the unusual heat did not affect the Canary Islands, Galicia, the western Cantabrian coast, and parts of the Mediterranean peninsular coast. Initially, Aemet forecasted that the heatwave would last until Wednesday, June 15, without ruling out the possibility of it continuing for the rest of the week. On June 11, high temperatures were already recorded in the southwest of the peninsula, with 41°C in Seville. Alerts remained active for Aragón, Castilla y León, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, and Madrid at the yellow level, and orange for Extremadura and Andalusia. However, the meteorological conditions did not meet the official criteria to declare the start of the heatwave. On June 12, thermometers recorded 43.2°C in Almadén (Ciudad Real), the highest value on the official start day of the heatwave. Temperatures above 40°C were also recorded at 47 Aemet network stations. Additionally, the agency issued special notice number 3/2022 with information about the phenomenon, its forecast, and announced the start of the national plan for preventive actions against the effects of excessive temperatures on health, including a level assignment map. In the province of Almería, a 62-year-old man died after collapsing and showing symptoms of dehydration while hiking on the Antenas trail near the Totem of Aguadulce. On June 13, Aemet announced in its official report a possible end date for the heatwave on Thursday, June 16, while noting that \"due to the behavior of a DANA (isolated depression at high levels) located in Madeira, whose evolution cannot be precisely determined.\" On June 14, the heatwave extended to southern Galicia and the interior of the Cantabrian region. Tropical nights also continued, with thermometers not dropping below 20°C in many provinces, particularly in Jaén, where a minimum of 27°C was expected. Furthermore, it was forecasted that the peak of the heatwave would be reached on Friday, June 17, breaking some temperature records in cities like Zaragoza, Lleida, and Córdoba. The only areas in Spain that had so far escaped the heatwave were Asturias, the Canary Islands, and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. In its daily report, Aemet forecasted the end of the meteorological episode for Saturday, as the DANA in the Atlantic, which injects hot African air, approached the peninsula, causing instability and a drop in temperatures. In Vega de Valcarce, a 69-year-old German pilgrim possibly died from heatstroke while walking the Villafranca del Bierzo stage of the Camino de Santiago. Rubén del Campo, Aemet spokesperson, stated that it was the \"most intense heatwave for mid-June in at least the last 20 years.\" On June 15, the \"Iberian exception\" was applied for the first time, whereby the regulated price of electricity is calculated with a cap on gas for its generation. The PVPC (Voluntary Price for Small Consumers) means higher electricity bills due to compensation for thermal power plants and increased use of gas and coal during the heatwave. Once this unusual heatwave subsides, it will be seen if PVPC-referenced bills decrease when all air conditioners are no longer running simultaneously. On June 18, the extraordinary heatwave that affected Spain between June 11-12 and June 18 came to an end, being described as \"intense, extensive, and extraordinary\" by the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET), which also highlighted that this spring heat episode was one of the earliest recorded in the country. On June 20, Monday until 12 p.m., the Zaragoza City Council extended the orange alert of the Civil Protection Emergency Plan for the heatwave, which had been activated on Tuesday, June 14, due to the high temperatures affecting the city, exceeding 40°C on several days and not dropping below 25°C on some nights. On July 6, the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) published a report detailing the month of June, highlighting the intense heat episode that extended from the first day of the month until June 19, with both maximum and minimum temperatures well above normal, particularly high during the central days of the month, due to an invasion of warm air from North Africa. The heatwave in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands between June 11 and 18, 2022, was the earliest occurrence in the series, matching records with the one that occurred on June 11, 1981."

        "content": "In Spain, after the heatwave of 1981, it is the earliest heatwave on record. The episode began on Sunday, June 12, 2022, when temperatures above 40°C were recorded at 47 stations of the State Meteorological Agency (Aemet) network, located in Andalusia, Extremadura, and Castilla-La Mancha. This heatwave follows two other related climatic episodes in Spain in 2022: the widespread drought in the winter of 2021-2022 and the hottest May of the 21st century. The heat caused hundreds of swift chicks to prematurely leave their nests, falling to the ground as they did not know how to fly. The Seville-based NGO Ecourbe, dedicated to biodiversity conservation, reported that up to one hundred chicks were collected from the ground in a single day in Córdoba and Seville. Comisiones Obreras of Extremadura demanded that the reduction of the workday by one hour for construction workers be brought forward, as this reduction is applied from July 15 to mid-August. On June 15, the Madrid City Council activated the red alert protocol for meteorology, given the forecast of a combination of temperatures above 35°C and wind gusts of more than 55 km/h, and consequently closed nine parks in the Spanish capital. The high temperatures, along with the drought, created conditions of extreme risk for forest fires throughout peninsular Spain, except for Galicia, most of the border with Portugal, and isolated points along the coast. A fire in the Sierra de la Culebra (Zamora) forced the evacuation of eight municipalities, while another fire in the province of Toledo led to the evacuation of 3,200 people from the Puy du Fou España theme park. High temperatures in schools caused an increase in dizziness and fainting among children. Families, teachers, and experts called for a plan to adapt schools to future heatwaves, which they will face if no action is taken for the next school year. Air conditioning should be the last resort to lower temperatures in schools, as it accelerates climate change, which in the coming years will cause more frequent and extreme heatwaves. The Community of Madrid manages four public swimming pools in the capital. Until Thursday, June 16, the intention was to keep them closed until the end of June. Swimming in pools alleviates the unpleasant thermal sensation caused by extreme heat, so public complaints led the Sports Councilor, Marta Rivera de La Cruz, to change the plan for opening these public pools. She apologized to the people of Madrid: \"It is true that the heatwave should have brought forward that opening.\" She announced that next year they will open at the beginning of the month, as was historically done until 2019. On Monday, June 20, hospitals in Zaragoza recorded an \"unusual peak\" in emergencies due to the heatwave. Some patients had to wait more than 60 hours to be admitted due to a lack of beds, with conditions caused in elderly and chronically ill people by the prolonged heatwave of the previous week. This new workload due to the heatwave adds to the burden that hospital emergency staff have been enduring for more than two years."

Heavy rains accompanied the winds, with a maximum three-day accumulation of 610 millimeters in Py in the Pyrénées-Orientales. The rest of the Pyrenees were heavily soaked, and a significant Cévenol episode developed with accumulations of 300 to 500 millimeters. Rainfall was also notable in the Provençal hinterland and Corsica. These precipitations caused the flooding of numerous rivers, particularly in the Cévennes and eastern Pyrenees. Foehn effects were observed on the western slopes of mountain ranges, such as in Corsica and the Pyrenees, leading to significant disparities in rainfall over short distances."

In a generally unfavorable atmospheric environment, it initially lacked organization and developed slowly. After several days of slow development, it intensified into a tropical depression within the monsoon trough on August 6. The tropical depression gradually strengthened in a favorable environment, becoming a tropical storm on August 8 and was named Khanun by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Khanun turned northward under the influence of the southerly flow brought by the subtropical ridge to the east. At this time, Khanun was still within the monsoon trough, with vigorous convection and good spiral structure, but concentrated in the eastern part, with the low-level circulation center partially exposed. Khanun intensified into a severe tropical storm at noon on August 9, with its structure further consolidating in the afternoon as the low-level circulation center developed under the convection and began forming an eye. Khanun reached its peak intensity on August 10, with maximum sustained winds near its center reaching 95 km/h and maximum gusts of 130 km/h. \n\nOn the evening of August 10, Khanun moved to the northwest of the subtropical ridge, turning northeast, passing about 10 km west of Jeju Island [4], and crossing southern South Korea the next morning. At this time, Khanun began to weaken due to strong vertical wind shear and the terrain of South Korea, with convection starting to dissipate and shift eastward, exposing the low-level circulation center. Khanun made landfall in Busan at noon, passing about 15 km northwest of the city [5]. Later that afternoon, Khanun entered the Sea of Japan. Affected by low sea surface temperatures and strong vertical wind shear, Khanun weakened into a tropical storm early on August 12 and crossed Japan that afternoon, eventually transitioning into an extratropical cyclone early the next day [6]."

As Kompasu began to move away from Hong Kong and weakened into a tropical depression, winds within the territory gradually subsided, and the Observatory changed to the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 7:20 pm on July 16, when Kompasu was about 55 kilometers north of the Observatory. Subsequently, all tropical cyclone warning signals were canceled at 8:20 pm.\n\nDuring Kompasu's closest approach to Hong Kong on the afternoon of July 16, strong winds were generally experienced within the territory, with gales over offshore waters and on high ground. The highest hourly mean wind speed recorded at Tap Mun was 47 kilometers per hour, with the highest gust reaching 79 kilometers per hour. Waglan Island recorded the highest hourly mean wind speed of 88 kilometers per hour, with the highest gust reaching 106 kilometers per hour. The minimum instantaneous sea-level pressures recorded at the Observatory headquarters, Waglan Island, and Ta Kwu Ling were 1,000.5 hPa, 995.7 hPa, and 1,001.0 hPa, respectively. Kompasu's rainbands and remnants brought heavy squally showers to Hong Kong on the afternoon of July 16 and the following day. The Observatory issued the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal twice, from 5:00 pm to 6:50 pm on July 16 and from 2:20 am to 3:30 am on July 17. The Observatory headquarters recorded over 120 millimeters of rainfall in total.\n\nAdditionally, during Kompasu's impact on Hong Kong, 12 people were injured, including two who were struck by falling objects in Tsuen Wan and North Point. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department received 19 emergency assistance requests for trees blown down by strong winds, blocking roads or posing dangers, with 4 cases on Hong Kong Island, 6 in Kowloon, and 9 in the New Territories. There was one minor flooding incident on Lockhart Road in Wan Chai, and no reports of landslides across the territory. The Home Affairs Department opened 25 temporary shelters, accommodating a total of 276 residents. Regarding maritime transport, most ferry services within the harbor and to outlying islands were suspended at one point. For land transport, the MTR, East Rail, West Rail, and Light Rail maintained limited services (the railway company was then known as KCR, now MTR), and public transport services gradually returned to normal in the evening.\n\nThe Observatory issued a \"Special Announcement on Tropical Cyclone\" at 9:45 am on July 16 and issued Signal No. 8 at 11:45 am. Many citizens only learned about the issuance of Signal No. 8 while commuting to work or after arriving at their workplaces (some had already been working for one or two hours), prompting them to rush home. Some citizens questioned why the Observatory could not issue Signal No. 8 earlier, before the start of work and school hours. Since Kompasu was only a tropical storm with a small circulation structure, its gale radius was only about 60 kilometers, and its strong wind radius was only about 150 kilometers. Therefore, slight changes in its path could significantly affect the wind conditions in Hong Kong. If Kompasu's path had shifted, making landfall east of Hong Kong along the eastern Guangdong coast instead of in Hong Kong, it might not have been necessary to issue Signal No. 8. As a result, the Observatory could only state that the chance of issuing Signal No. 8 was high without specifying the exact time. At 9:00 am on July 16, when Kompasu was about 100 kilometers east-southeast of the Observatory headquarters, winds in Hong Kong only reached moderate to fresh levels (not meeting the lower limit of Signal No. 3). Therefore, the earliest the Observatory could issue a Signal No. 8 alert was at 9:45 am. During the period when Signal No. 8 was in effect, only offshore waters and high ground experienced gale-force winds. After Kompasu weakened into a tropical depression, Signal No. 3 was issued at 7:20 pm on the same day."

As Kompasu approached, the Geophysical and Meteorological Bureau upgraded to Typhoon Signal No. 3 at 11:30 a.m. on July 16, when Kompasu was about 110 kilometers east-southeast of Macau. By 1 p.m., Kompasu was centered 100 kilometers east of Macau, moving northwest at a speed of about 20 kilometers per hour, gradually approaching Macau. The wind intensified, and the Meteorological Bureau announced that there was a high chance of hoisting Typhoon Signal No. 8 based on the typhoon's trajectory. While residents were generally expecting Kompasu to bring Typhoon Signal No. 8 to Macau, Kompasu, true to its name, abruptly changed its course by 90 degrees, heading directly toward Hong Kong. It made landfall at the High Island Reservoir in Sai Kung at 3 p.m. After changing its course, Kompasu's impact upon landfall posed no threat to Macau and moved inland into Guangdong. At 4 p.m. on the same day, Kompasu was closest to Macau, located about 95 kilometers northeast of the city. As Kompasu weakened and moved away, the Geophysical and Meteorological Bureau lowered all signals at 9 p.m. on July 16. Kompasu was the only tropical cyclone in 2004 to prompt the hoisting of tropical cyclone signals in Macau."

        "content": "Typhoon Utor was the second typhoon in July 2001 that required the issuance of the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal. This was the first time since 1966 that two No. 8 signals were issued in July. On July 23, a tropical depression formed about 600 kilometers northeast of Manila, Philippines, moving west-northwest at a speed of 25 kilometers per hour. By midday, it entered the Luzon Strait and strengthened into a tropical storm that evening, named \"Utor.\" After entering the South China Sea, Utor shifted westward and strengthened into a severe tropical storm before noon on July 24, and further intensified into a typhoon within a few hours. Utor had a compact circulation with an eye diameter of about 60 kilometers. \n\nOn July 25, Utor moved west-northwest, approaching the western coast of Guangdong. Early on July 26, Utor weakened into a severe tropical storm and made landfall near Zhanjiang around 5 a.m. It further weakened into a tropical storm in the afternoon and moved inland, eventually dissipating into a low-pressure area that evening.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Observatory issued the No. 1 Standby Signal at 9:50 p.m. on July 23, when Utor was about 720 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. On July 24, as Utor continued to approach, its outer rainbands brought heavy showers and thunderstorms to Hong Kong in the afternoon, prompting the Observatory to issue the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 3:50 p.m. That evening, local winds strengthened significantly, with offshore areas experiencing strong winds. \n\nIn the hours before midnight, Utor's central wind speed rapidly increased from 120 kilometers per hour to 148 kilometers per hour, with a gale radius of about 160 kilometers. At 12:30 a.m. on July 25, the Observatory issued the No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal. By early morning, offshore and highland areas experienced gale-force winds, and the wind direction shifted from northeast to southeast. At 10:40 a.m., the Observatory issued the No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal, marking the last time the No. 8 signal was issued in this manner. Utor was closest to Hong Kong at noon, located about 180 kilometers south-southwest of the city. That day, gale-force winds were recorded in southern waters and highland areas of Hong Kong. Under Utor's influence, Cheung Chau recorded a maximum hourly mean wind speed of 68 kilometers per hour and a maximum gust of 115 kilometers per hour. Tai Mo Shan recorded a maximum hourly mean wind speed of 79 kilometers per hour and a maximum gust of 112 kilometers per hour. Torrential rain associated with Utor brought over 60 millimeters of rainfall to areas near Tsuen Wan, while most parts of Hong Kong recorded over 20 millimeters of rainfall. At 7:40 p.m. that evening, the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal was reissued.\n\nDuring Utor's impact, 10 people in Hong Kong were injured in various accidents, and there were 11 reports of fallen trees. On Lower Albert Road, a six-meter-tall tree was blown down, temporarily disrupting traffic. Two trees were also blown down on Observatory Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, crushing a car and the canopy of a hotel. There were two incidents of scaffolding collapse in Yau Tong and Kwai Chung. Additionally, over 160 people sought refuge in temporary shelters across the city. During the period when the No. 8 signal was in effect, about 30 flights were canceled, and over 150 flights were delayed."

        "content": "The Observatory hoisted the No. 8 signal on Wednesday, July 25, for a duration of 19 hours and 10 minutes, overlapping completely with mainstream working hours and the operation times of the commercial stock market. Since it was a regular working day (Monday to Saturday), most citizens received a day off. However, due to Typhoon Yutu's relatively small circulation (a gale radius of only 160 kilometers) and a path that was further south than expected (initially predicted to pass about 150 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong, but ultimately passing about 180 kilometers southwest-southwest of Hong Kong), Yutu only brought gales to the southern waters and highlands of Hong Kong. The impact on Hong Kong's urban areas was significantly less than the traditional impression of No. 8 signal wind strength. Urban weather stations such as Sai Kung, the airport, Tsing Yi, and the Kowloon Star Ferry Pier recorded maximum hourly average wind speeds of 49, 44, 43, and 41 kilometers per hour, respectively, which were still some distance from the gale threshold of 63 kilometers per hour. Moreover, Macau, which was closer to Yutu than Hong Kong, only hoisted the No. 3 signal. Authorities in other nearby cities (such as Shenzhen and Zhuhai) also did not issue similarly severe warnings to the public.\n\nAs a result, the business sector, led by then Liberal Party Chairman James Tien and then Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce CEO Eden Woon, criticized the Observatory for mistakenly hoisting the No. 8 signal under weather conditions that were not particularly severe. This caused most industries and the stock market to halt operations unnecessarily that day, reducing business profits and resulting in significant economic losses (estimated at HK$3 billion to HK$4 billion). Even then-Chief Secretary for Administration Donald Tsang (later Chief Executive) joined the criticism, stating that caution should be exercised in hoisting typhoon signals in the future. \n\nFollowing this incident, the Observatory, to avoid further criticism from the business sector, gradually adopted a more conservative approach to hoisting/issuing signals, basing decisions solely on wind strength within Victoria Harbour. However, the Observatory overlooked the fact that wind strength in the harbor was already shielded by buildings, resulting in lower wind readings compared to other exposed urban weather stations. For example, during Severe Tropical Storm Vongfong in 2002, the Observatory decided at 4 p.m. on August 19 that Vongfong had almost reached its closest point to Hong Kong, passing about 400 kilometers southwest of the city, and refused to issue the No. 3 strong wind signal as winds in the harbor had not reached strong wind levels. However, by around 8 p.m. that evening, Vongfong reached its closest point to Hong Kong, located about 390 kilometers west-southwest of the city, and made landfall near Zhanjiang. At 7 p.m., Kai Tak recorded an hourly average wind speed of 41 kilometers per hour, reaching strong wind levels, while the Kowloon Star Ferry Pier recorded an hourly average wind speed of 40 kilometers per hour at 1 a.m. on August 20, just shy of strong wind levels. Despite strong winds being recorded in the harbor, the Observatory did not mention this in its tropical cyclone warning, only stating that strong winds were affecting offshore and highland areas in the southwest of Hong Kong. The Observatory's increasingly conservative approach to hoisting/issuing signals indirectly contributed to the Prapiroon incident in 2006."

Three hours later, it rapidly intensified into a typhoon near Dongsha, with a central pressure dropping to 960 hPa and maximum wind speeds near the center reaching 150 kilometers per hour. Between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. on July 25, Typhoon \"Yutu\" passed closest to Macau, about 160 kilometers south to southwest of the city. It then slightly shifted to a west-northwest direction, heading toward the Leizhou Peninsula. At 2 a.m. on July 26, it weakened into a severe tropical storm over the sea west of Macau (approximately at 21.3°N, 111.3°E). Two hours later, it made landfall along the southern coast of China between Yangjiang and Zhanjiang. \"Yutu\" turned northwestward inland in China and gradually dissipated, weakening into a tropical storm at 11 a.m. on July 26 and further into a tropical depression by 5 p.m. During its impact on Macau, there were minor damages such as fallen trees and signboards, as well as flooding in low-lying areas."

After crossing the Bashi Channel, Elsie took a more westerly path. The Observatory replaced the Standby Signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 8:00 PM on October 13, when Elsie was centered about 350 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. Although Hong Kong was experiencing only light to moderate westerly winds at the time, Elsie was still expected to be intense and might pass close to Hong Kong, prompting the Observatory to warn residents to complete wind protection measures. At 4:30 AM on October 14, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 8 Northwest Gale or Storm Signal, as Elsie was centered about 190 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. At that time, Hong Kong experienced moderate to fresh northwesterly winds. As Elsie approached during the day, wind strength in Hong Kong increased rapidly, with gale-force winds recorded starting at 9:00 AM, when Elsie was centered about 130 kilometers east-southeast of Hong Kong. Elsie remained well-organized and continued moving westward. At 11:00 AM, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 9 Gale or Storm Increasing Signal, indicating that wind strength in Hong Kong would significantly increase, as Elsie was centered about 70 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. By early afternoon, with clear signs that the eye of the storm would pass over the southern part of Hong Kong Island and its waters, the Observatory hoisted the No. 10 Hurricane Signal at 2:15 PM, with hurricane-force winds recorded offshore and in high-altitude areas. Elsie came closest to Hong Kong at 2:30 PM, centered about 50 kilometers south of the Observatory, moving westward at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour. During the afternoon, Tai Mo Shan recorded wind speeds of 130 kilometers per hour, with maximum gusts of 180 kilometers per hour, while Stanley recorded wind speeds of 141 kilometers per hour, with maximum gusts of 219 kilometers per hour. The instantaneous sea-level pressure at the Observatory headquarters dropped to a minimum of 996.2 hPa after 3:00 PM and quickly rose after the typhoon passed. \n\nElsie began to weaken after passing south of Hong Kong. As Elsie moved away, Hong Kong experienced easterly winds in the late afternoon, and wind strength began to moderate. At 5:05 PM, the Observatory replaced the No. 10 Hurricane Signal with the No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal, as Elsie was centered about 50 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. Later, at 8:10 PM, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal, as Elsie was centered about 70 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. On the evening of October 14, Elsie resumed a west-northwest path and further weakened into a tropical storm. After 10:00 PM, it crossed the coast of southern China about 110 kilometers west-southwest of Hong Kong. Wind strength in Hong Kong continued to weaken, and all signals were canceled at 2:00 AM on October 15, as the storm was centered about 150 kilometers west of Hong Kong. With a cool northeast monsoon beginning to affect the southern China coast, Elsie weakened into a tropical depression within the next hour and eventually dissipated inland about 190 kilometers west of Hong Kong by early morning.\n\nBefore Elsie's approach, Hong Kong experienced sunny and hot weather on October 12 and 13. On the morning of October 14, the weather turned cloudy with scattered showers, and rain became more frequent and accompanied by strong winds during the day. As Elsie moved closer to Hong Kong, heavy rain began in the early afternoon. The heaviest rain occurred between noon and 2:00 PM as Elsie passed south of Hong Kong. As Elsie moved away, rain weakened slightly later in the afternoon. On October 15, the weather remained overcast with light rain and occasional squally showers. Due to the influence of the easterly wind surge, the weather did not improve significantly the following day.\n\nUnder the influence of Elsie, five ocean-going vessels in Hong Kong dragged their anchors, and 46 people were injured on land due to debris and collapsed scaffolding, but there were no fatalities. Over 1,000 people sought refuge in storm shelters."

As Shirley continued to approach, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 3 signal at 6:15 pm. Shirley changed direction to move northwest towards Hong Kong in the early morning of August 21, and the Observatory replaced the No. 3 signal with the No. 7 signal at 7:00 am, when the storm was about 280 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. Shirley intensified into a typhoon in the afternoon. Due to its strengthening circulation, the Observatory replaced the No. 7 signal with the No. 9 signal at 2:40 pm, indicating stronger gale-force winds. When it was confirmed that the eye of the storm would pass over Hong Kong, the Observatory replaced the No. 9 signal with the No. 10 signal at 4:10 pm, when Shirley was about 80 kilometers southeast of the Observatory. Shirley's eye passed over the Observatory between 7:00 pm and 9:30 pm, during which Hong Kong experienced a sharp drop in wind speed, with light winds prevailing and calm conditions lasting for about two hours, though it remained cloudy with rain. The typhoon appeared to weaken slightly. The Observatory recorded the lowest instantaneous sea-level pressure of 968.7 hPa at 7:00 pm, the lowest on record for August. Shirley continued moving northwest at dusk, with most areas experiencing strong southerly winds starting at 10:00 pm. As Shirley weakened into a severe tropical storm at midnight, the Observatory replaced the No. 10 signal with the No. 6 signal at 11:45 pm, when the storm was about 90 kilometers northwest-north of the Observatory. As the winds gradually subsided, the Observatory replaced the No. 6 signal with the No. 3 signal at 5:25 am the next morning, when the storm was about 200 kilometers northwest of Hong Kong. Shirley significantly slowed down over Guangdong and finally weakened into a low-pressure area later in the morning. All signals were canceled at 12:10 pm. Shirley's passage over Hong Kong resulted in four injuries and caused a ship near the waters of Stonecutters Island to collide multiple times with another vessel."

However, the guiding airflow became unclear, and from the 7th to the 9th, its speed was only 5 kilometers per hour. During this time, its development was very slow, and it was not until the afternoon of September 9 that it intensified into a mild typhoon (by today's standards, it would not yet be considered a mild typhoon). At this point, it was located about 850 kilometers southwest of Iwo Jima. The typhoon then began to intensify rapidly, with its maximum wind speed increasing from 15 meters per second to 35 meters per second by the following morning. Its speed also began to accelerate, moving northwest-west at 15 kilometers per hour. At this time, Pamila had already become a moderate typhoon.\n\nOn the morning of September 11, Pamila had moved to the waters south of Naha. A strong high-pressure ridge to the north guided it to move west-northwest, with a pressure of 950 millibars and a maximum wind speed of 50 meters per second at its center. It had developed into a strong typhoon by the standards of the time. It suddenly accelerated, increasing from a slow pace to 33 kilometers per hour, and its westward path posed a serious threat to Taiwan. By 8 p.m., Pamila had reached a pressure of 930 millibars, with a peak maximum wind speed of 60 meters per second, and was located about 270 kilometers east of Hualien. At 2 a.m. on the 12th, it made landfall in the area between Yilan and Hualien. Later, it made a second landfall in mainland China. After making landfall in mainland China, Pamila gradually weakened and dissipated."

Areas such as Sanchong, Luzhou, Xinzhuang, Yonghe, Shilin, and Dazhi experienced serious flooding. Many of the flooded areas were within the Dahan River basin. In addition to the natural factor of heavy rain, it is said that human factors also played a role. The newly completed Shimen Reservoir upstream of the Dahan River misjudged the situation and suddenly released water. At a time when information was not well-developed, the public was unprepared, leading to catastrophic flooding and casualties in the Dahan River basin. According to data from the police department at the time, Typhoon Pamela caused 153 deaths, 140 missing persons, and 1,874 injuries across Taiwan. A total of 12,349 houses were completely destroyed, and 26,442 houses were partially destroyed, resulting in severe casualties. Many fishing boats also capsized and were damaged. Yilan County bore the brunt of the disaster and suffered unprecedented losses. After the disaster, the Executive Yuan established the \"Taipei Area River Flood Control Plan Review Committee\" to actively implement the Taipei flood control plan."

        "content": "In general, many typhoons passing through Taiwan's Central Mountain Range encounter varying levels of difficulty due to the circulation at different altitudes, which can easily induce a secondary low-pressure center to guide the typhoon across the mountains. However, Typhoon Pamela moved at a very fast speed, crossing the Snow Mountain Range before a secondary low-pressure system could form. By 8 a.m., it had already exited to the northwest of Taichung, spending only a little over five hours on land, which was quite astonishing. During this time, the typhoon's structure was also damaged, downgrading it to a moderate typhoon. While crossing the Snow Mountain Range, due to the influence of wind and terrain, the Foehn effect occurred in the Taitung area, causing temperatures to rise from 27°C at 1 a.m. to 32.3°C at 2 a.m., which lasted until 6 a.m. By 2 p.m., Pamela had entered the mainland and rapidly weakened, transforming into an extratropical cyclone by the next morning.\n\nThe highest average wind speed of Typhoon Pamela was recorded in Keelung City at 35 meters per second, followed by the landfall point in Yilan County at 34.8 meters per second, with the maximum instantaneous gust reaching 44.8 meters per second. In terms of rainfall, Wulai in Taipei County received the most, with 347.2 millimeters during the typhoon's passage over Taiwan. Su'ao Township recorded 319.8 millimeters, Yilan City had 203 millimeters, Taipei City only received 100 millimeters, and the plains in the southwest and eastern regions barely exceeded 50 millimeters. Hengchun Township experienced almost no rainfall (0.9 millimeters).\n\nAdditionally, when Pamela formed, its development was slow during the first three days, and its structure was not very strong. However, it rapidly intensified into a severe typhoon within just two to three days (one of the fastest-developing typhoons in recent years was Typhoon Zeb). It also accelerated from its initial slow movement. The meteorological bureau originally predicted that Pamela would continue moving northwest, but unexpectedly, the high pressure to the north prevented it from moving northward, causing it to shift westward and threaten Taiwan. At the time, meteorological technology was lacking, and there was insufficient maritime data to make accurate predictions. The bureau had to rely on meteorological data from the U.S. military to issue typhoon warnings for Pamela. The bureau initially predicted landfall at 9 a.m. on the 12th, but as the typhoon approached eastern Taiwan, it slowed down to search for a landfall point. However, it unexpectedly made landfall in the Yilan-Hualien border area at 2 a.m., catching meteorologists off guard. It then rapidly crossed the Snow Mountain Range, leaving meteorologists astonished and drawing criticism from the public for the large prediction error. Furthermore, the severe flooding in the Dahan River basin in Taipei was attributed to human factors, highlighting that the issues surrounding Typhoon Pamela were not only about its path but also about human negligence."

The Hong Kong Observatory assessed its central wind speed at 60 kilometers per hour. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also rated this tropical disturbance as \"low,\" indicating a certain probability of developing into a tropical cyclone, but it was ultimately not upgraded to a tropical depression. The tropical depression moved northward, passing between Lantau Island and Hong Kong Island, then crossing Tsing Yi Island, and made landfall near Tsuen Wan before 10:15 PM that evening. It passed through Pat Heung and Kai Kung Leng. The tropical depression left Hong Kong around midnight, entering Shenzhen near Lok Ma Chau.

Due to the formation of a tropical depression within Hong Kong's territory, wind speeds increased rapidly, prompting the Observatory to directly issue the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 9:15 PM. This was the first time since 1993 that the No. 3 Signal was directly issued. At that time, the tropical depression was located about 35 kilometers southwest of the Hong Kong Observatory headquarters. The tropical depression had a diameter of approximately 200 kilometers, with a strong wind radius of about 25 kilometers and a central wind speed of 60 kilometers per hour. The tropical depression came closest to the Observatory headquarters at around 10 PM that night, passing about 10 kilometers west of the headquarters, and then made landfall near Tsuen Wan before 10:15 PM (initial reports suggested landfall around 10:30 PM). It crossed the western New Territories, with winds shifting to the southwest and gradually weakening by early morning. Sustained winds in the eastern regions briefly reached gale force, with a 10-minute average wind speed of 70 kilometers per hour recorded in Sai Kung. \n\nAs the tropical depression moved inland and began to dissipate, the Observatory announced at midnight that the No. 3 Signal would be lowered shortly, and all tropical cyclone warning signals were canceled at 1:45 AM the following day. During the impact of Tropical Depression 618 on Hong Kong, incidents such as scaffolding collapse in Siu Sai Wan and wooden boards falling from a construction site in Chai Wan occurred, but no injuries were reported. \n\nIt is relatively rare for a tropical depression to form so close to land. The last tropical cyclone to form in close proximity was Tropical Storm Lisa in 1996, which formed about 160 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong, requiring only the issuance of the No. 1 Standby Signal. This tropical depression was later referred to as \"Tropical Depression 618.\""

The tropical depression moved westward, then turned northwest, and passed near Changsa Town, Wenchang City, Hainan Province, at 5 p.m. on August 29. The tropical depression then turned northwest. At 2 a.m. on August 31, the tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm in the Beibu Gulf and was named Fitow. At noon on August 31, Fitow made landfall near Qisha Town, Port District, Fangchenggang City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. After landfall, Fitow quickly weakened. By 2 p.m., Fitow had weakened into a tropical depression. By 5 p.m. on September 1, it had completely dissipated. [1] However, the China Meteorological Administration believed that Fitow had not completely dissipated, later re-entered the sea off the eastern Leizhou Peninsula, and made landfall again in Sanya City, Hainan Province, at 5 a.m. on September 10, before dissipating after making landfall in Vietnam at 2 a.m. on September 12. It affected Hainan Province for 16 days, making it the longest-lasting tropical cyclone to affect Hainan Province since 1949. It made landfall on Hainan Island twice and stayed on land for over 72 hours, also making it the longest-lasting tropical cyclone to make landfall on Hainan Island since 1949. [2][3]"

The Hong Kong Observatory issued a Black Rainstorm Warning Signal at 10:45 PM on September 1, which was not canceled until 4:30 AM. Rainfall across Hong Kong reached 100 millimeters, with areas such as Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung, and Sha Tin recording up to 200 millimeters. During the rainstorm, there were over 19 cases of flooding and 11 landslides. One landslide occurred in Tai Wai, where 11 villagers had to be urgently evacuated. In Sai Kung, a slope collapsed during the rainstorm, severely damaging a stone house. A section of the overhead power cable on the Kwun Tong Line of the MTR was struck by lightning, causing a temporary power outage. One train service between Quarry Bay Station and Lam Tin Station was disrupted, and approximately 400 passengers had to walk 500 meters along the tracks to the station. The trough of low pressure lingered along the southern coast of China, causing unstable weather for several days. Red Rainstorm Warning Signals were issued on September 3 and September 7. The weather in Hong Kong only improved on September 8 as the trough moved away."

Due to Carmen's impact, Hong Kong and Macau had to hoist the second-highest No. 9 tropical cyclone warning signal for two consecutive years. The storm formed on October 14 over the Philippine Sea, further developing into a typhoon and moving toward central Philippines, where it made landfall. While affecting the Philippines, Carmen weakened temporarily due to terrain effects but reorganized after entering the South China Sea. However, as it approached the coast near the Pearl River Estuary, it was suddenly deflected westward by cold air from Guangdong Province, avoiding landfall, and dissipated south of Shangchuan Island on October 20, with a lifespan of about six days. Carmen caused at least 13 deaths, 9 injuries, and economic losses of 64 million pesos in the Philippines. It brought significant damage to South China but also alleviated drought conditions with its rainfall, prompting the Hong Kong government to fully lift the water rationing measures for that year.

        "content": "A tropical depression formed on October 14 over the Philippine Sea, 805 kilometers east-southeast of Manila, Philippines. After forming, it moved westward at a speed of approximately 13 kilometers per hour, heading toward central and northern Philippines. [1] The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began monitoring it and assigned it the Philippine name \"Tering\" as it formed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility. [2] The next day, the system shifted to a northwestward movement, and both the Royal Hong Kong Observatory and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a tropical storm, with the latter naming it \"Koinu.\" [3] On the same day, the Central Weather Bureau upgraded it to a mild typhoon. [4][Note 2] The Hong Kong Observatory further upgraded Koinu to a severe tropical storm on the same day. [1] By October 16, Koinu had intensified further. The Hong Kong Observatory analyzed satellite imagery and noted that its circulation was well-organized. Subsequently, reconnaissance aircraft reported a continuous drop in central pressure, prompting the Observatory to follow the U.S. in upgrading it to a typhoon, while the Central Weather Bureau upgraded it to a moderate typhoon on the same day. [3][4][1] Koinu maintained a northwestward direction on the same day and made landfall in central Luzon. It later exited to the sea, entering the northern South China Sea. [1] Koinu's structure was damaged due to the terrain of the Philippines, leading the U.S. to downgrade it to a tropical storm. However, as it moved over the South China Sea, it reorganized, and the U.S. re-upgraded Koinu to a typhoon. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Observatory and the Central Weather Bureau maintained its classification as a typhoon and a moderate typhoon, respectively. [4][1] Later on October 17, Koinu steadily moved to the waters south of the Pearl River Estuary, accelerating to a speed of nearly 17 kilometers per hour. The Hong Kong Observatory observed that its spiral rainbands continued to develop and intensify. [1] On October 18, the Hong Kong Observatory's weather radar captured Koinu's cyclone center, with an eye diameter of nearly 100 kilometers, and indicated that Koinu was turning northwestward, moving closer to the Pearl River Estuary. [1] However, the U.S. and the Central Weather Bureau downgraded it again to a tropical storm and a mild typhoon, respectively, on the same day. [4] At that time, Guangdong Province was under the influence of cold air, which affected Koinu. As it approached the coastal area near the Pearl River Estuary, it suddenly turned westward without making landfall and began to weaken rapidly during the day on October 19. The U.S. and the Central Weather Bureau downgraded it to a tropical depression within the same day, while the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded it to a tropical storm. [3][4][1] The next day, the Hong Kong Observatory reported that Koinu had weakened into a low-pressure area south of Shangchuan Island. [1]"

In Baguio City, landslides occurred in some residential areas. According to Agence France-Presse, a six-year-old girl and her 16-year-old brother lost their lives due to landslides caused by the typhoon, and some members of two families were injured.

[9] As Kaman moved directly towards the coast of South China, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 4:30 pm the same day, when Kaman was steadily moving northwest in the evening. [10] Due to Kaman's increased northward movement, advancing towards the Pearl River Estuary, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal at 10:10 am on October 18. [11] Kaman began to turn northwest by north in the evening, moving closer to Hong Kong. At 4:30 am on October 19, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 9 Gale or Storm Increasing Signal. [12] Kaman was closest to Hong Kong at around 9 am, located approximately 130 kilometers southwest by south of Hong Kong, marking the farthest distance of a storm center from Hong Kong for a No. 9 Signal in history. [1] Affected by a cool and dry northerly airstream, Kaman began to turn west and slowly moved away from Hong Kong. As it was expected that the wind in Hong Kong would not further intensify, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 8 Southeast Signal at 11 am and then with the No. 3 Signal at 3 pm the same day. [13] Kaman continued to weaken under the influence of the airstream and became a low-pressure area south of Shangchuan Island on the morning of October 20. All signals were removed at 10 am that day, with all times in daylight saving time. [14][1] In response to the typhoon, the Education Department announced the suspension of classes in all schools across Hong Kong on October 18 and 19. The Foreign Exchange Bankers' Association announced the temporary closure of all banks in Hong Kong. The four major stock exchanges and the Gold and Silver Exchange suspended trading from the afternoon, some maritime routes ceased services, and some flights were canceled. Land transportation and the Kowloon-Canton Railway provided limited services until gradually stopping in the evening. [15] Some government departments deployed personnel to maintain emergency services and remain on alert, while typhoon shelters in various districts were opened for those in need. [16] Kaman brought continuous heavy rain to Hong Kong. A young man who swam from mainland China to Hong Kong was found lying on the beach at Sharp Nose Point during the No. 9 Signal and was confirmed dead after being sent to the hospital. [17] Another girl was swept away by floodwaters in Kam Tin. [18] The storm caused severe flooding in low-lying areas of urban Kowloon and the New Territories. Authorities also received numerous reports of landslides or road damage, as well as incidents of ships breaking anchor and collisions between two vessels, but no injuries were reported. [19] A severe landslide occurred on the slope behind Lai Sing House in Tai Hang Road due to the storm, submerging the underground parking lot in mud. Hundreds of residents of Lai Sing House had to evacuate overnight. [20] The Third Resettlement Area near Chai Wan Estate was affected by the storm, with seawater flooding the area and causing waterlogging. 800 residents had to evacuate to nearby police stations and Chai Wan Estate for temporary shelter, with the number of evacuees later increasing to over a thousand. After the incident, the resettlement area was left muddy, and many homes were in disarray. [21] More than ten days later, Typhoon Ellen struck Hong Kong, prompting the Observatory to hoist the No. 8 Signal again. As both Kaman and Ellen brought abundant rainfall, a record for the highest October rainfall since the Observatory's establishment was set, along with a significant 220 billion gallons of potable water. The Public Works Department's Water Supplies Department announced the complete cancellation of water rationing measures for that year. [22]"

During the tropical cyclone's impact, the Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge was temporarily closed and only reopened for traffic at 6:30 p.m. on the 19th after the Signal No. 3 was issued. Most shops suspended operations, Macau's streets were paralyzed for a time, and the Emperor Entertainment Group temporarily ceased operations until the evening of the 19th, while the Grand Lisboa remained unaffected.

When Gloria reached the Pearl River Estuary, Hong Kong recorded hurricane-force winds for one hour during the hoisting of the No. 8 signal, prompting the Royal Hong Kong Observatory to directly raise the No. 10 signal. Meanwhile, the Macau Meteorological Bureau did not record sustained hurricane-force winds and thus only raised the No. 9 signal. The observatory recorded 12 hours of strong winds, 14 hours of gale-force winds, and one hour of hurricane-force winds. On September 22, Macau recorded a pressure of 970.8 hPa, an east wind at 110 km/h, gusts reaching 144 km/h, and a maximum daily rainfall of 79.3 mm, causing flooding in low-lying areas of Macau. Typhoon Gloria made landfall in Macau at 9 p.m. on September 22, with maximum wind speeds at the center reaching 162 km/h.

It moved west or west-northwest at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour. Initially, Becky remained at tropical depression strength, with maximum winds only reaching gale force. However, after entering the waters of the Balintang Channel, it strengthened into a tropical storm and was named \"Becky.\" At that time, its movement speed significantly increased, moving west-northwest at 30 kilometers per hour into the northern South China Sea. On September 17, Becky intensified into a severe tropical storm about 50 kilometers southwest of the Dongsha Islands and accelerated again, moving at 34 kilometers per hour toward the western coast of the Pearl River Estuary. On the same day, it made landfall in Chixi Town, Taishan City, Guangdong Province. Becky quickly weakened into a tropical storm about 200 kilometers northeast of Zhanjiang City. On September 18, it weakened into a tropical depression near Liuzhou City in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and dissipated a few hours later in northern Ha Giang Province, Vietnam."

The Observatory issued the No. 1 Standby Signal at 9:30 am on September 16, when Becky was located about 660 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. Initially, the weather was generally clear with light winds. As Becky approached, the northeast wind strengthened, and squalls and thunderstorms began to affect Hong Kong. The Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 10:30 pm that night. Due to continued strengthening winds, the Observatory replaced it with the No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal at 2:50 am on September 17. According to the Observatory's tropical cyclone report, Becky was closest to Hong Kong at around 7 am, located about 110 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. In fact, some citizens and former Observatory staff pointed out that Becky was closest to Hong Kong at around 9 am, located about 90 kilometers southwest of the Hong Kong Observatory, consistent with the Observatory's radar positioning and clear media reports at the time. However, the Observatory overturned the real-time positioning in the 1993 Tropical Cyclone Annual Report and did not acknowledge that Becky had reached hurricane-force winds, meaning it entered within 100 kilometers of Hong Kong at typhoon strength, meeting the conditions for issuing a higher signal. A former Observatory staff member pointed out that starting at around 8 am that morning, Cheung Chau experienced several hours of sustained hurricane-force winds. Before the Cheung Chau wind station went into maintenance mode, it recorded a maximum hourly average wind speed of 139 kilometers per hour, indicating that Becky had reached typhoon strength and brought hurricane-force winds to southwestern Hong Kong. This proves that the Observatory's classification of Becky as a severe tropical storm was a significant underestimation of its intensity, and not issuing the No. 10 Hurricane Signal was a serious mistake. At 8 am that morning, Shek Lau Wan and Wong Chuk Hang also recorded maximum hourly average wind speeds of 99 and 62 kilometers per hour, respectively, which were higher than the 87 and 54 kilometers per hour recorded during Super Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018. The Observatory headquarters also recorded a minimum instantaneous sea-level pressure of 997.3 hPa. As the wind shifted to the southeast, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal at 7:30 am. On that day, Hong Kong generally experienced gale to storm-force winds, with hurricane-force winds persisting in the western and southern areas, offshore waters, and highlands until Becky made landfall in western Guangdong. Showers decreased in the afternoon, and the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 3:10 pm, replacing the No. 8 Southeast Gale or Storm Signal, when Becky was located about 270 kilometers west of Hong Kong. All tropical cyclone warning signals were canceled at 5 pm. During Becky's impact on Hong Kong, 1 person died, and 130 people were injured. [2]"

        "content": "The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau hoisted Typhoon Signal No. 1 at 12:00 noon on September 16. On September 17, as Typhoon Becky approached with strong winds and heavy rain, the bureau hoisted Typhoon Signal No. 3 at 12:30 a.m. and Typhoon Signal No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal at 6:30 a.m. Due to the continued strengthening of winds and the typhoon's closer approach to Macao, Typhoon Signal No. 9 was hoisted at 9:00 a.m. At the same time, the Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge recorded the highest hourly average wind speed of 124 km/h, marking the first time hurricane-force sustained winds were recorded in the region. The main station at Mount Fortress recorded a maximum hourly wind speed of 73 km/h, while the Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge recorded the highest gust of 166 km/h at 9:23 a.m., with the lowest instantaneous sea-level pressure at 982.3 hPa. During this period, coinciding with astronomical high tide, low-lying areas such as the Inner Harbor, San Kio, and Ilha Verde experienced seawater flooding. The water level on Rua Cinco de Outubro even reached thigh height, and the Macao Water Supply Company's plant in Ilha Verde was affected by flooding, temporarily halting water supply. Numerous incidents of structural collapse occurred across the city: one side of the exterior wall and windows of the Global Hotel near Tap Seac Square were blown down by strong winds; a large tree fell in the parking area at Senado Square, crushing several cars; a large section of scaffolding collapsed near the CEM building on Rua do Almirante Sérgio; and many shanties along the Lin Ma Hang and Fai Chi Kei waterfronts were destroyed. The seawall near the old Outer Harbor Ferry Terminal on Avenida da Amizade was severely damaged by waves, and the terminal facilities were also affected. Subsequently, as Typhoon Becky moved away from Macao, the Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau replaced Typhoon Signal No. 8 Southwest Gale or Storm Signal at 10:30 a.m., then Typhoon Signal No. 3 at 1:30 p.m., and finally canceled all signals at 4:00 p.m. Typhoon Becky caused a total of 43 injuries in Macao, with 2 people seriously injured, and over 1,700 people had to take shelter at the Ilha Verde disaster relief center. Due to damage to facilities, hydrofoil ferry services between Hong Kong and Macao remained suspended as of 9:00 p.m. on September 17 and only fully resumed the following day. At the Transmac bus depot in Areia Preta, nearly 50 buses were completely flooded and paralyzed. After overnight emergency repairs, 30 buses were operational the next day."

        "content": "When Becky struck Hong Kong and Macau, the meteorological departments of both regions underestimated its intensity. On the morning of September 17, 1993, Becky passed about 90 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong and approximately 45 kilometers south-southwest of Macau. The Hong Kong Observatory and the Macau Geophysical and Meteorological Bureau only issued the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal and the No. 9 Signal. However, hurricane-force winds persisted in the western and southern areas of Hong Kong, offshore waters, and highlands, while Macau experienced widespread hurricane-force winds. This not only met the criteria for the No. 10 Signal in both regions but also indicated that Becky was indeed a typhoon. This highlights the poor forecasting ability and accuracy of the meteorological departments in Hong Kong and Macau at the time regarding rapidly intensifying and accelerating tropical cyclones near the coast, as well as their low responsiveness to sudden situations. Although many years have passed since Becky struck Hong Kong and Macau, many residents and weather enthusiasts in both regions still point out in forums that the meteorological departments underestimated its intensity and question the rationale for not issuing higher signals, which continues to spark considerable debate."

It caused severe impacts in the south, resulting in at least 290 deaths, 262 injuries, and the collapse and destruction of numerous houses, making it the most impactful typhoon during the early Japanese colonial period. In particular, about 80% of public infrastructure in Tainan Prefecture was damaged, including the collapse of the first-generation wooden West Market building and damage to the Five Concubines Shrine at Chihkan Tower, among other severe disasters. Early houses were mostly wooden structures, which suffered heavy losses in this typhoon, leading to subsequent public building reconstructions using more durable materials and methods such as brick and reinforced concrete.

        "content": "In late August 1911, a typhoon formed in the southern Pacific Ocean. This typhoon passed through the Philippines, Taiwan, and East Asia, causing significant damage. On August 21, meteorological observations from Guam and Yap Island indicated that a typhoon was gathering west of the Mariana Islands, moving west or west-northwest. By August 23, the typhoon began affecting the Philippines, with areas about 500 miles (805 kilometers) east of Luzon experiencing pressure drops and wind direction changes due to the typhoon's circulation. On the 24th, signs of the typhoon's arrival were observed on the small northern Philippine island of Basco. Early on the 26th, the pressure at the Basco weather station began to plummet, wind speeds increased, and rainfall was recorded. Between midnight and 7 a.m., the wind direction shifted from north-northeast to north, then to northwest-north. By 7 a.m. on the 26th, the pressure recording paper dropped below the lower limit of 715 mmHg (953.3 hPa). At 8 a.m., the wind direction shifted to northwest, but the rain stopped. At 8:20 a.m., Basco entered the typhoon's eye, the sky became calm, and the sun was visible. Sustained wind speeds dropped to level 4, though strong gusts still occurred. At 9 a.m., wind speeds suddenly increased, and the wind direction shifted from northwest to west-southwest. For several hours afterward, hurricane-force winds persisted, with the wind direction changing to southwest. By noon, the pressure recording paper showed a rise above 715 mmHg (953.3 hPa), and the pressure continued to rise as the wind weakened and the typhoon gradually moved away from Basco. Due to the pressure recording paper dropping below its limit, the lowest pressure recorded locally is unknown. However, based on the pressure curve, it is estimated that the lowest pressure recorded in Basco may have reached 690 mmHg (920 hPa) or lower.\n\nAfter passing Basco, the typhoon approached Taiwan, with Hengchun being the first to be affected. The pressure continued to drop. At 10 p.m. on August 26, Hengchun recorded a minimum hourly pressure of 702.9 mmHg (937.1 hPa) and a maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed of 34.4 meters per second. According to the Central Weather Bureau's path map, the typhoon did not make landfall in Hengchun but passed very close to its western coastal waters before possibly making landfall in southwestern Taiwan. At 4:45 a.m. on the 27th, Tainan recorded a minimum pressure of 726.8 mmHg (969 hPa) and a maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed of 38.2 meters per second (or 54.5 meters per second according to another source [Reference 2]), the highest sustained wind speed ever recorded in Tainan. Tainan's 24-hour rainfall on the 27th was 384.9 mm, ranking fourth in daily accumulated rainfall [Reference 1:81]. During the typhoon, Tainan's total rainfall was 423.8 mm, while Hengchun's total rainfall was 515.4 mm. The chief scientist at the Hengchun Weather Station stated that the typhoon's intensity was extremely strong, with almost no houses left undamaged. Unfortunately, the anemometer cups were blown away, so the maximum wind speed could not be recorded. However, he estimated that the maximum wind speed could have reached 70 meters per second.\n\nAfter passing Taiwan, the typhoon moved northwest-north and made landfall in China. By August 28, its remnants were located southwest of Shanghai, moving northwest. On August 29, it moved west of Shanghai and dissipated inland."

Since most early buildings were made of wood, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office adopted brick and reinforced concrete for public building reconstruction plans after the disaster. For example, Taipei City experienced flooding due to the typhoon, with areas like Dadaocheng severely affected by collapsed houses. The government took this opportunity to implement urban improvement and street house reconstruction plans, introducing architectural and facade style elements from European architecture for street rebuilding. In 1912, the following year, areas such as Beidou, Nantou, and Daxi, which were affected by the typhoon and flooding, also drafted urban improvement plans. Tainan suffered severe damage from the storm. Preliminary statistics on building damage in the Fucheng area showed that 86 private houses were completely or partially destroyed, with many others flooded, and six warehouses damaged. Regarding public buildings, 80% of Tainan's administrative offices were damaged, including the Tainan Office Affairs Room, General Affairs Section, and the east and west markets. Historical sites such as the Five Sons Shrine of Chihkan Tower were damaged, and decorative ceramic figures on the roof of the Liangguang Guild Hall were peeled off. In the Anping area, nearly 200 houses were completely or partially destroyed, with two injuries and two deaths, and four ships capsized in the harbor. At that time, the largest market in Fucheng, the West Market, saw its entire first-generation wooden structure destroyed. Therefore, when rebuilding the West Market in 1912, durability was considered, and the most advanced R.C. construction method in Taiwan at the time was used to build three buildings, with the central building being two stories high. The storm also caused the Zhuoshui River railway bridge to be washed away, disrupting the north-south railway line."

        "content": "As early as August 17, a broad low-pressure area formed northeast of Luzon, Philippines. At that time, this low-pressure area remained stationary in the Luzon Strait due to the influence of the high-pressure ridges over the western Pacific and southeastern China. On August 18, the high-pressure area over southeastern China weakened, and sudden rain began to appear in southern China, causing the system to start moving westward. However, it was also affected by strong vertical wind shear in the northern South China Sea, showing no signs of developing into a tropical cyclone. Despite this, the low-pressure area did not dissipate; instead, its storm circle continued to expand. Later, on August 20, the vertical wind shear affecting the northern South China Sea began to weaken, and the Japan Meteorological Agency classified the system as a tropical disturbance after it entered the South China Sea. By midnight on August 21, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression, as it had already moved to the northern South China Sea near the Dongsha Islands. \n\nAt 8 a.m. on August 22, the Hong Kong Observatory also upgraded the system to a tropical depression, as it was located about 670 kilometers south of Hong Kong, within the 800-kilometer range of Hong Kong. However, due to the weak intensity of the tropical depression and its storm circle being concentrated in the central South China Sea, it did not bring immediate severe weather to Hong Kong, only causing slight swells in the southern waters of Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong Observatory did not issue the Standby Signal No. 1. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center classified the system as a tropical depression in the afternoon of August 22, designating it as the sixth tropical cyclone warning (06W) issued in the western Pacific. \n\nOn the morning of August 23, the system intensified into a tropical storm, named Pabuk, and was expected to generally move toward the Gulf of Tonkin. That evening, the Hong Kong Observatory and the China Meteorological Administration upgraded Pabuk to a severe tropical storm. On August 24, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning for the system. On the morning of August 25, the Hong Kong Observatory and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a tropical depression and a low-pressure area, respectively."

Vicente struck the Pearl River Estuary at peak intensity, becoming the most notable typhoon disaster in the region in over a decade. It prompted the Hong Kong Observatory to issue its first No. 10 Hurricane Signal in nearly 13 years and led the Macau Meteorological Bureau to hoist the No. 9 Signal, also for the first time in nearly 13 years. Since Vicente was closer to Macau, the decision of the Macau Meteorological Bureau not to hoist the No. 10 Signal sparked widespread controversy.

However, the Hong Kong Observatory did not issue a \"Special Weather Alert,\" handling it differently compared to tropical cyclones Talim and Doksuri earlier that year. At 3:40 PM that day, the Observatory issued the No. 1 Standby Signal, with Vicente located about 540 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. The Observatory stated that Vicente's organization was \"relatively loose\" at the time and that it was still some distance away from Hong Kong, making it unlikely to issue the No. 3 Signal that evening, though it would consider doing so the next day. \n\nUnder the combined influence of an anticyclone over southern China and Vicente's subsiding air currents, Hong Kong experienced hot and hazy weather that day, with temperatures in most areas rising to 34 degrees Celsius or above, and some areas recording highs of 37 degrees Celsius. The Very Hot Weather Warning was in effect until 7:45 PM. The hot weather also triggered convective rain, with a strong thunderstorm area forming in eastern Guangdong and crossing Hong Kong at sunset, bringing thunderstorms to the region. The Observatory issued the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal at 5:35 PM, which remained in effect until 6:40 PM. As the thunderstorm area passed through Hong Kong, it brought brief strong gusts, with sustained wind speeds temporarily surging. Sai Kung, Kai Tak, and Cheung Chau recorded brief strong winds. However, as the thunderstorm area weakened suddenly while crossing Hong Kong, the heavy rain only brought 20 to 30 millimeters of rainfall to eastern Hong Kong, falling short of the Amber Rainstorm Warning standard. Only the eastern coast of Sai Kung experienced heavier rainfall, recording 40 millimeters. After the heavy rain, double rainbows appeared in some parts of Hong Kong. \n\nThe strong gusts brought by the rainstorm caused a scaffolding structure on Wang Chin Street in Kowloon Bay, near the MTR Shatin to Central Link International Mail Centre, to collapse entirely. Additionally, over a dozen people kayaking, rowing, and surfing fell into the sea, but fortunately, there were no casualties. \n\nOn July 22, Vicente continued to approach. The Observatory stated that it was unlikely to issue the No. 3 Signal in the morning but would consider doing so in the afternoon. Later, it revised its statement, saying it was unlikely to issue the No. 3 Signal in the afternoon but would consider doing so if Vicente moved closer or the winds strengthened. As Vicente's movement slowed and it stalled about 350 kilometers south-southeast of Hong Kong, the No. 1 Signal remained in effect throughout the day, and the Observatory did not issue the No. 3 Signal, postponing the decision to the morning of July 23. Following the earlier impact of Severe Tropical Storm Talim, the Observatory once again reminded parents to pay attention to storm updates before sending their children to school. \n\nThe weather in Hong Kong remained hot that day, with widespread areas recording maximum temperatures of 32 degrees Celsius or above. However, Vicente's outer rainbands also brought squally showers and occasional thunderstorms to Hong Kong."

The Observatory subsequently stated that the No. 3 Signal would be maintained during the day, and unless Vicente accelerated towards the coast of South China or further intensified, the chance of issuing the No. 8 Signal during the day was low. Winds in Hong Kong began to strengthen significantly in the morning, with strong northeasterly winds affecting widespread areas in the afternoon, and occasional gale-force winds affecting offshore and highland areas [11]. \n\nAs Vicente accelerated north to northwest-northwest, the Observatory announced at 11:45 a.m. that the No. 8 Signal might be issued around dusk. With Vicente rapidly intensifying into a typhoon, the Observatory issued a \"Special Weather Alert\" at 2:05 p.m., stating that Vicente would pass within 200 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong, and the Observatory would consider issuing the No. 8 Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. At this time, the weather in Hong Kong deteriorated rapidly, with squally showers and occasionally heavy rain. The Observatory issued a \"Special Report on Tropical Cyclones\" at 3:45 p.m., announcing that the No. 8 Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal was expected to be issued by 6 p.m. or earlier. After 4 p.m., Cheung Chau, one of the eight designated automatic weather stations in the Observatory's wind measurement network, began recording gale-force winds [12]. \n\nUnder the impact of strong winds, a giant tree over 20 meters tall collapsed in Siu Sai Wan, crushing a minibus [13]; in Central's Connaught Road Central, wooden boards were blown up by strong winds, injuring several pedestrians, one of whom was directly knocked unconscious by the boards."

After the No. 8 signal was issued, foreign objects were found on the tracks at MTR Ngau Tau Kok Station and Mong Kok East Station, but as train services had already been reduced to limited service, there were only slight delays without significant disruption. Additionally, Kowloon Motor Bus announced at 8:40 PM that all routes would be suspended, and Citybus and New World First Bus also announced the suspension of most services. Winds in Hong Kong rapidly and significantly strengthened, and shortly after nightfall, many areas were already affected by gale-force winds from the east to northeast, with signs of further intensification.\n\nAt 8:45 PM on the same day, the Observatory stated that Vicente had slightly intensified and was taking a more northwesterly path, coming closer to Hong Kong. It was expected that Vicente would pass about 100 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. The Observatory further indicated that if winds in Hong Kong strengthened further, it might need to issue a higher tropical cyclone warning signal, urging the public to stay updated on the latest storm information. At 11:20 PM, the Observatory issued the No. 9 Gale or Storm Signal, when Vicente was located about 110 kilometers south-southwest of Hong Kong and had rapidly intensified into a severe typhoon. This was the first No. 9 signal in three years since Typhoon Molave directly hit Hong Kong in 2009. The Observatory noted that \"in the past few hours, Vicente has rapidly intensified into a severe typhoon\" and stated that Vicente was still taking a northerly path, approaching Hong Kong, and would pass within 100 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong. However, it did not mention whether the No. 10 Hurricane Signal would be issued. This was also the first time in the Observatory's history that the term \"rapidly intensified\" was used, and it marked Vicente as the first severe typhoon under the Observatory's new tropical cyclone classification system to trigger the issuance of the No. 8 or higher signal.\n\nWinds in Hong Kong further strengthened to storm force and shifted to blow from the east to southeast. In particular, wind speeds at Cheung Chau, Cheung Chau Beach, and Waglan Island exceeded 110 kilometers per hour, approaching hurricane force."

Limited services were maintained on the Kwun Tong Line (Yau Ma Tei to Choi Hung section; now Choi Hung to Whampoa section), Tsuen Wan Line (Lai King to Central section), Island Line (Sheung Wan to Heng Fa Chuen section; now Heng Fa Chuen to Kennedy Town section), and West Rail Line (Hung Hom to Tsuen Wan West section; now Tuen Ma Line Tsuen Wan West to East Tsim Sha Tsui section), while other sections were suspended. The incident originated from a tree collapse at Tai Po Market Station, which blocked the tracks and damaged cables, causing a power outage and an immediate paralysis of the East Rail Line. Even after repairs, services could not resume before the end of the operating hours. The Kwun Tong Line trains were also affected, with passengers causing a commotion at Choi Hung Station. Due to the power outage, some passengers were trapped on trains and had to spend the night in the carriages. Eight East Rail Line trains lost power, with one train experiencing a complete blackout in three carriages. Over a thousand passengers were affected, forced to stay overnight in train carriages and station halls. Meanwhile, other sections also experienced power trips, and power supply began to return to normal at 2:44 a.m. the next day, but by then, no trains were running. The MTR opened stations for passengers to rest, but passengers expressed strong dissatisfaction with the MTR's arrangements and criticized the lack of an earlier service suspension. The East Rail Line was paralyzed for nearly eight hours, and limited services were only restored south of Fo Tan Station at the scheduled first train departure time. Services north of Fo Tan Station remained suspended until 7:35 a.m. on July 24, when the fallen tree at Tai Po Market Station was cleared, allowing full service to resume."

Coupled with its increased movement speed of 20 kilometers per hour, it created a \"semi-circle effect,\" placing Hong Kong in its \"dangerous semi-circle.\" The automatic weather station at Cheung Chau Beach first recorded a maximum 10-minute average wind speed of 127 kilometers per hour at midnight, reaching hurricane levels. The main station at Cheung Chau also began intermittently recording hurricane-force winds after midnight, which later became sustained, with wind speeds surging to over 130 kilometers per hour. As the two near-sea-level automatic weather stations in Cheung Chau successively recorded hurricane-force winds, the Hong Kong Observatory issued the No. 10 Hurricane Signal at 12:45 a.m. on July 24 without prior notice. At that time, Vicente was centered about 100 kilometers southwest of the Hong Kong Observatory headquarters. This was the first No. 10 signal in nearly 13 years since Typhoon York struck Hong Kong in 1999, and the first \"issued\" rather than \"hoisted\" No. 10 signal since the closure of the Cheung Chau Signal Station. The Observatory stated that \"Vicente's eyewall was very close to the southwestern part of Hong Kong, bringing hurricane-force winds to the area; frequent squalls and heavy rain were also affecting Hong Kong,\" and urged residents not to leave sheltered areas and to closely monitor broadcasts regarding tropical cyclone warnings. The Observatory also issued a landslip warning at 1:10 a.m., a yellow rainstorm warning signal and a special report on flooding in the northern New Territories at 1:55 a.m., along with a thunderstorm warning issued at 12:15 a.m., resulting in five warnings being in effect simultaneously. This was the first time since Typhoon Molave struck Hong Kong in 2009. Vicente was closest to Hong Kong between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., passing about 100 kilometers southwest of the Observatory headquarters. Many areas in Hong Kong experienced gale to storm-force winds from the east to southeast, while the southwestern regions, offshore areas, and high grounds were continuously affected by hurricane-force winds."

Hong Kong experienced southeast gales to storms. Vicente made landfall near Taishan and weakened into a typhoon. Winds in Hong Kong gradually subsided, and storm-force winds were no longer observed after sunrise, though strong winds continued to affect most areas. The Observatory announced at 7:45 a.m. that the No. 3 Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal would be issued around 10 a.m., and by 10 a.m., winds in most areas had dropped below gale force. The Observatory issued the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 10:10 a.m., with Vicente located about 230 kilometers west of Hong Kong, having weakened into a severe tropical storm. At sunrise, fallen trees at Tai Po Market Station on the East Rail Line had not yet been cleared, and services on the section north of Fo Tan Station were suspended until around 7:35 a.m. Fallen trees also affected Light Rail services at San Hui Station, disrupting some routes. The Observatory canceled all rainstorm warnings at 10:40 a.m. As Vicente weakened and moved further away, winds across Hong Kong generally subsided, with most areas experiencing winds below strong wind levels except for offshore and highland areas.

Although the winds in the city had already eased at that time, offshore and highland winds remained strong, with the Cheung Chau automatic weather station still recording strong winds after nightfall. At 10:45 PM, the Observatory announced that Vicente's circulation no longer covered Hong Kong; under the combined influence of a high-pressure ridge over southeastern China and a broad monsoon trough, offshore and highland areas were still affected by strong winds. Finally, at 11:15 PM, the Observatory canceled all tropical cyclone warning signals, with Vicente located approximately 600 kilometers west-northwest of Hong Kong at that time. Due to the influence of the monsoon trough, offshore and highland winds remained strong, and the Observatory issued a Strong Monsoon Signal one minute later, which was canceled at 5:20 AM the following day. During the effective period of the Strong Monsoon Signal, winds in Cheung Chau remained at strong levels, and Sai Kung also recorded brief strong winds. Over the next two to three days, Hong Kong was intermittently affected by heavy rain due to the combined influence of Vicente's residual rainbands and the broad monsoon trough, with the Observatory issuing multiple Amber Rainstorm Warnings. By July 28, Vicente's residual low-pressure area and the broad monsoon trough dissipated, and a high-pressure ridge over southeastern China extended to the Guangdong coast, leading to gradually improving weather. \n\nThe Observatory issued a press release on the day after Vicente dissipated (July 26, 2012), describing the rapid intensification of Vicente from a tropical storm to a severe typhoon within two days as \"unprecedented\" among tropical cyclones for which the No. 10 signal was issued. Over two months later, on October 5, 2012, the Observatory finally completed Vicente's report and uploaded it to its website, making it the tropical cyclone report that took the longest time to produce since Typhoon York, surpassing the time taken for Typhoon Dujuan in 2003 and Typhoon Nuri in 2008."

Both the No. 3 and No. 8 signals met the criteria. The measured wind speeds in many parts of Hong Kong were the highest since Typhoon York in 1999, with wind speed data from many automatic weather stations approaching records set by Severe Tropical Storm Becky in 1993 and Typhoon Ellen in 1983. Some automatic weather stations established in recent years even recorded record-breaking wind speeds. Based on the eight automatic weather stations in the revised tropical cyclone warning system of 2013, with Lau Fau Shan replacing Wetland Park, five stations recorded gale-force winds. This was the second time since the adoption of this wind measurement network that two stations recorded storm-force winds, the fourth time that widespread strong winds were recorded, and the fourth time the No. 8 signal met the criteria. The airport recorded a 10-minute average wind speed of 96 km/h, tying the record set during Typhoon York in 1999. Cheung Chau even recorded hurricane-force winds, marking the first time since the adoption of the wind measurement network in 2007 that a reference automatic weather station recorded hurricane-force winds. Except for the failures at Stanley Wong Ma Kok and Tap Mun stations, all automatic weather stations across Hong Kong recorded strong winds or higher, an unprecedented occurrence since the Observatory launched the \"One District, One Station\" initiative in 2007, which ensured at least one automatic weather station in each of Hong Kong's 18 districts, doubling the number of stations. During the storm, the highest 10-minute average wind speeds recorded at Cheung Chau, the airport, Kai Tak, Sai Kung, Tsing Yi, Wetland Park, Ta Kwu Ling, and Sha Tin were 140, 96, 85, 83, 52, 50, 47, and 47 km/h, respectively. In the southwestern regions of Hong Kong, offshore areas, and highlands, hurricane-force winds persisted, with Cheung Chau recording the highest 10-minute average wind speed of 140 km/h, the highest since Typhoon Ellen in 1983. The Cheung Chau Beach automatic weather station, operational since Typhoon Koppu in 2009, recorded a record-breaking 10-minute average wind speed of 127 km/h. Additionally, the exposed and elevated Ngong Ping recorded a 10-minute average wind speed of 197 km/h and a maximum gust exceeding 250 km/h before the anemometer malfunctioned. According to the Observatory's Vicente report, Ngong Ping recorded a maximum gust of 256 km/h. In Victoria Harbour, the automatic weather station at the Kowloon Star Ferry Pier recorded a 10-minute average wind speed of 87 km/h, approaching storm-force levels, with the highest hourly average wind speed reaching 83 km/h, both records being the highest since Typhoon Ellen in 1983. The Kai Tak automatic weather station recorded a 10-minute average wind speed of 85 km/h and a maximum hourly average wind speed of 70 km/h, the highest since Severe Tropical Storm Becky in 1993. Additionally, a weather enthusiast \"chased the wind\" at the Hung Hom Pier, where their anemometer recorded storm-force average wind speeds and gusts reaching hurricane-force levels of 152 km/h. Due to the exposure to easterly winds, Hung Hom Pier is a popular spot for weather enthusiasts to measure wind speeds."

Additionally, the Development Bureau, Highways Department, and Leisure and Cultural Services Department received reports of 2 landslides, 7 flooding incidents, and 8,800 cases of fallen trees, with the number of fallen tree reports breaking records. During the period when the No. 10 signal was in effect, the Observatory also issued other warnings, including the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal, Landslip Warning, Thunderstorm Warning, and Special Flooding Report for Northern New Territories. This No. 10 signal was one of the farthest recorded instances of a tropical cyclone center from Hong Kong (Typhoon Vicente passed approximately 100 kilometers southwest of the Observatory headquarters) and was tied for the second shortest duration of a No. 10 signal (lasting 2 hours and 50 minutes), alongside Typhoon Elsie in 1975, second only to Typhoon Alice in 1961 (when the No. 10 signal lasted only 2.5 hours).

He stated that typhoons and heavy rain would inevitably cause inconvenience to residents, but the bureau prioritizes ensuring public safety. On August 14, the Meteorological Bureau announced that it would adjust its wording, considering that terms like \"in the next few hours\" could lead to differences in understanding depending on when the public receives the information. They would replace such terms with \"around a certain number of hours.\" However, they did not immediately adopt Lam Heong Sang's suggestion to extend the official warning time to two hours or more. It was not until four years later, during Typhoon Haima, that a No. 8 typhoon signal warning exceeding two hours was issued for the first time."

        "content": "During the storm, Macau experienced the largest storm surge since Typhoon Ketsana's direct hit in 2009, with severe flooding in the Inner Harbor area caused by seawater backflow, reaching depths of over 1 meter, meeting the criteria for a black storm surge warning. However, the Macau Meteorological Bureau did not issue the highest storm surge warning. Additionally, the bureau delayed issuing yellow and red storm surge warnings. Although a minor seawater backflow was forecasted on the evening of the 23rd, the yellow storm surge warning was not issued until 12:30 a.m. on the 24th. By around 1 a.m., severe flooding had already occurred in the Inner Harbor, New Road, and the area near Rua da Praia do Manduco, leading to full road closures. However, the red storm surge warning was only issued at 2:15 a.m. when the No. 9 typhoon signal was hoisted. Many businesses suffered significant losses due to water damage to their goods, and the bureau faced criticism for ambiguous information about seawater backflow, with the storm surge notification mechanism being deemed ineffective for early warnings. Afterward, Director Fong Soi Kun stated that the forecasting models from major meteorological centers indicated only minor flooding, and there was a deviation in the release of storm surge information, failing to meet the original goal of issuing warnings six hours in advance. He later mentioned that the storm surge warning system was introduced in 2009 and had not been implemented frequently, resulting in a lack of experience."

        "content": "The Macau Meteorological Bureau hoisted the No. 9 typhoon signal at 2:15 a.m. on the 24th, while the Hong Kong Observatory had already issued the No. 10 hurricane signal for an hour and a half, resulting in a temporary two-level tropical cyclone warning difference between Hong Kong and Macau. Macau's three bridges recorded a one-minute average wind speed exceeding 118 km/h starting at 1 a.m., and subsequent reports showed that the average wind speed over the past hour at 2 a.m. reached level 11, highlighting the delay in hoisting the No. 9 signal. Many netizens in discussion forums criticized the Meteorological Bureau for dereliction of duty, demanding the resignation of Director Fong Soi-kuan. Hong Kong netizens joined the discussion, accusing the Macau Meteorological Bureau of \"not hoisting the No. 10 signal when it should, and hoisting it when it shouldn't,\" mocking that during Fong Soi-kuan's tenure, there was no need to hoist the No. 10 signal because \"it would take over a decade or even 20 years to encounter a typhoon eye passing through,\" thereby criticizing Macau's stricter criteria for the highest typhoon signal compared to Hong Kong, which only requires hurricane-level winds recorded at any sea-level location within its territory.\n\nSeveral members of Macau's Islands Community Advisory Committee also criticized the Meteorological Bureau for misjudgment, pointing out that the typhoon's path suggested Macau should have been more affected than Hong Kong, forming a stark contrast with the Hong Kong Observatory's issuance of the No. 10 hurricane signal. They questioned the standards used by the Meteorological Bureau to determine typhoon signals and urged a review of the tropical cyclone warning mechanism. Director Fong Soi-kuan responded that the standards for hoisting the No. 10 signal in Macau and Hong Kong are different. In Macau, in addition to an average wind speed of 118 km/h, the typhoon center must also pass through Macau. The highest recorded average wind speed this time was 115.2 km/h, which falls within the range of the No. 8 signal. The No. 9 signal was hoisted due to the severe impact caused by Vicente's approach, but the conditions for hoisting the No. 10 signal were not met.\n\nLater, Director Fong Soi-kuan explained, along with unofficial analyses, that generally, the closer Macau is to a tropical cyclone, the stronger the local winds. However, unlike Hong Kong, Macau was not affected by continuous strong rainbands, which could have further intensified the winds through downbursts accompanied by heavy rain. Additionally, Vicente's eyewall had a gap, and when it was closest to Macau, this gap rotated over Macau, placing it between the eyewall and the stronger spiral rainbands. As a result, Macau did not experience the full impact of the eyewall, and the hurricane conditions within Macau were not as sustained as those in Hong Kong's Cheung Chau, leading to the discrepancy in signals between the two regions. Due to Hong Kong's larger area compared to Macau, the chance of recording hurricane-level winds at any sea-level location in Hong Kong is higher than in Macau, which also increases the likelihood of the Hong Kong Observatory issuing the highest signal compared to the Macau Meteorological Bureau. Some netizens also believed that the Meteorological Bureau had no intention of hoisting the No. 9 signal and only did so \"reluctantly\" when Vicente was just 50 km away from Macau and all three bridges recorded hurricane-level winds.\n\nEventually, five years later, Typhoon Hato forced the Meteorological Bureau to hoist the No. 10 signal, leading to Fong Soi-kuan stepping down and facing disciplinary action the following year. Subsequently, the Meteorological Bureau revised the criticized overly strict criteria for issuing the No. 10 signal, adopting a more lenient standard based on a 10-minute average wind speed and no longer requiring the typhoon center to pass over Macau."

A similar situation occurred during Typhoon Koppu's direct hit in 2009, leading to further criticism of the Meteorological Bureau. Some citizens complained that the bureau was too quick to hoist the No. 3 signal, leaving insufficient time to prepare for work, while others felt the timing was appropriate. Director Fong Soi-kuen stated that the decision to hoist the No. 3 signal at 9:30 a.m. that day was correct. Subsequently, Macau's average wind speed was below 63 kilometers per hour, necessitating a lower signal. The Meteorological Bureau predicted that gusts in the city would reach 60 kilometers per hour in the afternoon, and up to 70 kilometers per hour on the bridge."

This low-pressure area formed east of the Philippines, developed into a tropical depression the following day, and made landfall in the Philippines on the 8th. It weakened into a low-pressure area due to wind shear, terrain, and the northeast monsoon, with its movement becoming slow. Its residual cloud bands later reorganized and moved southeast of Vietnam but weakened and dissipated again under the influence of the northeast monsoon."

        "header": "Development process",
        "content": "On January 5, 2017, a low-pressure area formed in the southeastern waters off Mindanao, Philippines. The United States Naval Research Laboratory assigned it the tropical disturbance number 96W, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the system's chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"low\" at 2 PM the following day. At that time, the easterly flow of the subtropical ridge guided the system westward at a speed of about 15 kilometers per hour, approaching central Philippines. However, strong vertical wind shear suppressed its development, leaving the system loosely organized with an exposed low-level circulation center. Nevertheless, the abundant latent heat supplied by the waters of the Northwest Pacific allowed the system to develop slowly. As the system gradually consolidated and began to rotate on the 7th, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded its rating to \"high\" at 8 AM and simultaneously issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 9 AM, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center followed suit at 5 AM on the 8th, assigning it the tropical cyclone number \"01W.\" The Hong Kong Observatory followed at 6:45 PM.\n\nComputer models consistently predicted that the low-pressure system would sweep across the Philippines and then move into the southern South China Sea, eventually making landfall in Vietnam. The system continued westward, approaching central Philippines, ultimately making landfall on Siargao Island. It then moved into a weak point of the subtropical ridge, becoming trapped in a saddle-shaped pressure field, which slowed its movement. Although the saddle field provided good low-level convergence, the terrain of the Philippines had a greater-than-expected impact on the system, cutting off its moisture supply for an extended period, causing signs of cloud dissipation. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning at 5 PM, and the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded the system back to a low-pressure area at 8 AM on the 10th. Its remnants later moved into the southern South China Sea via the Sulu Sea.\n\nThe system absorbed energy from the South China Sea and attempted to re-strengthen, successfully resisting strong vertical wind shear and gradually repairing its low-level circulation center, which also expanded significantly. The Japan Meteorological Agency reclassified it as a tropical depression at 2 AM on the 11th. However, as vertical wind shear increased, its intensity weakened, and its cloud clusters dissipated. The Japan Meteorological Agency subsequently downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 8 AM. Later, the system reorganized, and a more robust cloud cluster reappeared on satellite imagery. The Japan Meteorological Agency reclassified it as a tropical depression again at 4 PM. On the 12th, increased vertical wind shear caused the system's cloud bands to be significantly separated, leaving the low-level circulation center fully exposed and creating a convection void. By the 13th, convection erupted again around the low-level circulation center as the system attempted to repair itself, but there were no signs of the center being covered by cloud bands, and the low-level circulation center remained exposed. On the same day, the system became trapped in a saddle-shaped pressure field near Vietnam and slowly drifted northward. This was due to the subtropical ridge being unable to extend westward under the influence of another low-pressure area. Absorbing energy from the sea, the system strengthened again, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to assess its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \"medium\" at 1 AM on January 14. The rating was further upgraded to \"high\" at 8:30 AM, and a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued simultaneously. By the 15th, decreasing wind shear created more favorable conditions for the system to absorb energy from the sea and repair its low-level circulation center. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reclassified it as a tropical depression at 9 AM. However, the strong winter monsoon moved southward on the 16th, weakening the system again, causing its cloud clusters to dissipate and convection to vanish. The system then made landfall in Dam Doi District, Ca Mau Province, Vietnam. After landfall, the system was disrupted by terrain, making its low-level circulation center difficult to identify. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning, and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 2 PM that day. Its remnants later moved into the Gulf of Thailand but failed to reorganize. The Hong Kong Observatory's isobaric weather chart at 2 AM on the 17th showed that the system had dissipated."

Olin made landfall on Siargao Island, bringing heavy rain and strong winds, reaching gale-force levels. However, Olin later moved slowly over the Philippines and eventually weakened into a low-pressure area, prompting the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration to cancel the Signal No. 1 warning that had been in effect for two days. Nevertheless, the remnants of Olin's low-pressure system continued to bring unstable weather and heavy rain to the Philippines, resulting in the drowning of a 15-year-old girl named Villaflores in Cebu Province on her way to school (despite classes being suspended)."

The Hong Kong Observatory stated that it would consider issuing a tropical cyclone warning signal on the evening of June 20. At 9:35 PM on the same day, the Observatory issued the No. 1 Standby Signal, with Haima located about 420 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. On June 21, the Observatory indicated that Haima would maintain some distance from Hong Kong during the day and would consider whether to issue the No. 3 Signal from the evening of the same day to the morning of June 22. \n\nAt 5:45 AM on June 22, the Observatory issued the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal, with Haima located about 330 kilometers south of Hong Kong. That morning, winds in Hong Kong strengthened, with strong easterly to northeasterly winds affecting many areas, including Victoria Harbour. By the evening, widespread areas of Hong Kong experienced strong southeasterly winds, with gale-force winds in offshore waters and high ground. The Observatory stated that unless Haima significantly intensified or took a more northerly route, the chances of issuing a higher warning signal were low. At 8 PM, Haima was closest to Hong Kong, passing about 240 kilometers southwest of the city.\n\nAs Haima continued to move west-northwest and gradually moved away on June 23, winds in Hong Kong weakened. At 10:25 AM, the Observatory replaced the No. 3 Signal with the No. 1 Standby Signal, with Haima located about 310 kilometers west-southwest of Hong Kong. Due to the influence of the subtropical ridge, offshore winds continued to reach strong wind levels, and the Observatory did not cancel all tropical cyclone warning signals until 8:45 PM, when Haima was about 450 kilometers west-southwest of Hong Kong.\n\nDuring the storm, four of the eight designated automatic weather stations in the Observatory's wind measurement network recorded strong winds, with one station even recording gale-force winds, meeting the criteria for the No. 3 Signal. Cheung Chau, the airport, Sai Kung, and Kai Tak recorded maximum 10-minute average wind speeds of 84, 59, 53, and 49 kilometers per hour, respectively.\n\nSubsequently, the Observatory published an article titled \"Using Aircraft to Collect Tropical Cyclone Data\" in its \"Observatory Newsletter,\" stating that during Haima's approach to Hong Kong, it collaborated with the Government Flying Service for the first time. Senior pilot Leung Man-chiu of the Flying Service piloted a Jetstream-41 fixed-wing aircraft equipped with meteorological instruments to approach Haima's center and collect meteorological data. Since then, the Observatory has collaborated with the Flying Service multiple times for this mission, including during the approach of Severe Typhoon Vicente in 2012, which brought the No. 10 Signal to Hong Kong."

Since Haima only strengthened into a mild typhoon after moving away from Taiwan, and the Central Weather Bureau had already lifted the tropical depression advisory, no typhoon warning was issued. However, due to the influence of its outer circulation, rainfall continued in the southern and southeastern mountainous areas of Taiwan until the heavy rain advisory was lifted.  \nAs Haima gradually moved away from Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau downgraded the heavy rain advisory to a rain advisory and continued to issue it until the evening of June 22."

The great drought, as it was known, caused the largest wave of internal migration in the country, resulting in the departure of approximately 164,183 people over these 20 years, along with other factors. Most of those affected were economically active individuals, aged between 20 and 40 years. It occurred during Ecuador's last dictatorship, at a time when agrarian reform was implemented, which attracted migrants to the most populated cities, such as Quito, Guayaquil, and the surrounding cities, as well as to the coast, in the province of El Oro, during the banana industry boom. Its most critical point took place in 1968, when crops such as corn, vegetables, beans, and rice were produced by the hectare in the province. Loja's culture developed an independent inclination from the country, stemming from the Peruvian-Ecuadorian war and this drought, influencing politics, such as agrarian reform; society, such as migration; gastronomy, with low-cost dishes like repe lojano; and art, such as murals."

        "header": "2021 Taiwan Drought Water Shortage Crisis",
        "content": "The 2021 Taiwan drought and water shortage crisis was a large-scale drought event that occurred in early 2021 in the western region of Taiwan's main island, leading to varying degrees of water pressure reduction, water rationing, fallow farming, and business closures. It was the most severe drought since 1947 and was referred to as the \"century drought.\" This drought was alleviated between late May and late June by several waves of plum rain fronts, showers, and southwest monsoon rains, and the Central Drought Response Center was deactivated on June 22. By late July to early August, significant rainfall brought by Typhoon In-Fa, Typhoon Lupit, and southwest monsoon fronts restored normal water conditions across Taiwan's main island and the outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu by August 5, marking the end of this drought.\n\nThe 2021 drought was caused by a short and insufficient rainy season during Taiwan's 2020 plum rain season, followed by a typhoon season without any typhoons making landfall or approaching Taiwan. The two most critical water collection periods for reservoirs in western Taiwan experienced low rainfall, resulting in low reservoir storage levels, which relied solely on summer showers for replenishment. Subsequently, the autumn and winter dry seasons in the southwest, which are typically low in rainfall, made it difficult to alleviate the drought. Hopes were placed on spring rains from February to April to ease the drought, but due to factors such as the La Niña phenomenon, the 2021 spring rainfall was the lowest on record, causing reservoir storage levels to continue to decline. In May, the Pacific high-pressure system abnormally strengthened and extended westward, and the plum rain front developed further north, leading to high temperatures and low rainfall in Taiwan, delaying and reducing the plum rain season. With no hope of replenishment, reservoirs in western Taiwan gradually reached critical alert levels, and some areas in central Taiwan began implementing water rationing measures in early April.\n\nIn the southwestern Pingtung region, however, abundant and well-developed groundwater resources prevented the area from entering a drought alert status by May, despite low rainfall. This was due to water resource reserves and utilization, including the Erfeng Irrigation Canal, designed by Shinpei Goto during the Japanese colonial period, which was restored in early 2017, and the Dazhou Artificial Lake, completed in 2018, which serves as a groundwater recharge lake. The lake has injected 50 to 70 million tons of water into the underground aquifer, acting as an underground reservoir.\n\nIn contrast, northern and eastern Taiwan did not face water shortages due to abundant rainfall brought by the northeast monsoon during the 2020-2021 autumn and winter seasons. The Feitsui Reservoir had surplus capacity to assist the Shimen Reservoir's supply area during the water shortage, extending the Shimen Reservoir's supply period.\n\nLong-term observations indicate that rainfall brought by typhoons contributes approximately 40% of Taiwan's annual precipitation. However, the strong Pacific subtropical high-pressure system in 2020 resulted in a lack of typhoons for Taiwan. Climate model assessments suggest that human-induced climate change will significantly strengthen the Northwest Pacific subtropical high-pressure system. This implies that under climate change, Taiwan will face long-term drought challenges with reduced precipitation in the future."

        "content": "In 2017, the Lin Chuan Cabinet of the Executive Yuan deployed relevant water conservancy projects in the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program to address Taiwan's climate change and uneven drought and flood conditions. After several years of construction and implementation, the related facilities proved effective during this drought. In July 2020, the Ministry of Economic Affairs preemptively deployed measures, strengthened management and allocation, and accelerated the completion of related water resource construction and the Drought-Resistant Water Source 1.0 Plan. In 2021, to cope with the current drought, the government and private sector sought various ways to develop emergency water sources, and the second Su Tseng-chang Cabinet launched the Drought-Resistant Water Source 2.0 Plan in March.\n\nThe number of drought-resistant wells in Taichung increased from 25 to 88, with drilling operations running 24 hours a day. By the end of the month or early May, the daily water supply could reach 115,000 tons, equivalent to the water usage of 500,000 people. Emergency deployment of CPC Corporation drilling experts with specialized equipment drilled three deeper wells near Liyutan Reservoir, adding approximately 15,000 tons of water daily, expected to be completed by the end of April.\n\nAfter Kaohsiung's water status turned to orange in April, the city government, in collaboration with the Water Resources Agency, drilled 62 wells and allocated water from Chengcing Lake Reservoir. By May 5, the reservoir's water storage increased to 92%, holding 2.42 million tons, resolving Kaohsiung's May water crisis of turning to red status.\n\nThe Ministry of Economic Affairs urgently added a seawater desalination plant in Taichung, with the first phase supplying water on May 15, increasing the daily water supply by 13,000 tons. By the end of May, the daily supply increased to 15,000 tons. The Wuxi riverbed water guidance project in Taichung added 55,000 tons of water daily.\n\nThe Kaohsiung City Government and the Water Resources Agency completed subsurface water facilities such as Xingtian, Xipu, and Dazuan upstream of the Gaoping River weir as part of the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program. These facilities were initially completed in 2020, supplying 400,000 tons of raw water daily and 300,000 tons of backup water. The backup water has been activated in response to the current drought.\n\nIn Taichung, water from construction sites of major projects like Lafayette and CMP was tested and filtered to meet tap water standards before being integrated into the tap water system. In Tainan, groundwater quality from the Guiren construction project was tested and found suitable for domestic use. The Tainan City Government installed large-scale RO water purification equipment, expected to supply 350 tons of water daily into the tap water pipeline.\n\nOn March 13, Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je stated that Taipei had begun expanding water support, transporting 910,000 tons of water daily to New Taipei, Keelung, and Taoyuan to facilitate the transfer of water from Shimen Reservoir to Hsinchu and Miaoli.\n\nFrom September 2020 to April 22, 2021, the Water Resources Agency's rain enhancement team conducted 45 artificial rain enhancement operations in reservoir catchment areas across northern, central, and southern Taiwan. These included 32 ground-based operations, 8 high-altitude flare operations, 2 drone-based experiments, and 3 Air Force aerial operations.\n\nAt noon on May 17, the Water Resources Agency released rain enhancement flares at Bao'er, Yongheshan, and Mingde Reservoirs. However, Deputy Director Wang Yifeng stated that due to weak cloud systems, the rainfall was minimal, rendering the artificial rain enhancement operation \"almost ineffective.\"\n\nDomestic sewage and industrial wastewater, after treatment at sewage treatment plants and further precision filtration and purification at reclaimed water plants, can be used for non-domestic purposes, preventing competition for water between industrial, domestic, and agricultural uses."

        "content": "The Central Drought Disaster Response Center decided in a meeting on March 24 that due to severe water conditions in parts of Miaoli, Taichung, and northern Changhua (Changhua City and parts of Hemei and Huatan), a red alert for zoned water supply will be implemented starting April 6. Additionally, from April 1, the water alert in Kaohsiung will change from a yellow alert for reduced pressure water supply to an orange alert for reduced water supply, and in Lienchiang, the alert will change from a green alert for water conservation reminders to a yellow alert for reduced pressure water supply. The zoned water supply areas are divided into two zones, with water supplied for five days and cut off for two days, aiming to save 15% of water. Due to the drought in central reservoirs, the Central Drought Disaster Response Center announced that parts of Miaoli and Taichung would enter a \"5 days on, 2 days off\" water restriction for residential use starting April 6, affecting approximately 1.064 million households. This is Taiwan's third large-scale zoned water supply in nearly 20 years. The Central Taiwan Science Park and Houli Science Park, which have dedicated pipelines, will reduce supply but not stop it. Although rainfall in April remained unsatisfactory, several emergency water supply measures proved effective, and on May 6, the Central Drought Disaster Response Center decided to maintain the current water alert levels. Due to the continued decline in the water storage rate of Shimen Reservoir, the water alert in Taoyuan City and Linkou District of New Taipei City was changed to an orange alert for reduced water supply starting May 21. At the end of May, consecutive afternoon thunderstorms increased the water volume of the Gaoping River and raised the water storage rate of Chengqing Lake Reservoir. On May 29, the water alert in Kaohsiung was changed from an orange alert to a yellow alert for reduced pressure water supply. From June 4 to June 6, Typhoon Choi-wan and the plum rain front brought abundant rainfall to Taiwan, alleviating the water situation. Starting June 6, the red alert for zoned water supply in Miaoli, Taichung, and northern Changhua was lifted, ending the longest water restriction in history.  \n\nIn response to the \"5 days on, 2 days off\" water restriction, the Taichung City Government's Sports Bureau temporarily closed public swimming pools in Taichung starting April 6. Only three locations—the competition pool at the North District National Sports Center, the Wuri heated swimming pool, and the Zhongxing swimming pool—were designated for priority use by athletes during training sessions. To reduce inconvenience caused by water cuts, the Water Corporation decided to undertake emergency pipeline construction, utilizing a deep well drilled last year at the Water Resources Planning and Experiment Institute in Wufeng to support parts of Caohu in Dali District, Taichung City, with an expected daily water supply of 2,000 tons upon completion.  \n\nIn response to water restrictions, the Changhua County Government temporarily opened the swimming pool at the Changbei Sports Center from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. starting April 6. The county government also guided public and private swimming pools and sauna operators to suspend operations. However, similar to the guidance for car wash businesses to suspend services, some operators expressed dissatisfaction. To find water sources, many residents applied for legal well drilling, with the number of monthly applications for legal water rights and well drilling in 2021 significantly increasing compared to the previous year, mostly for agricultural use.  \n\nIn Chiayi City, starting March 23, all elementary and middle schools suspended swimming pool courses, replacing them with indoor courses such as water safety and lifesaving education. In Chiayi County, starting April 1, schools suspended the use of swimming pools, and swimming classes were replaced with alternative courses. Public-private partnership and private swimming pools were left to comply with central policies on their own.  \n\nIn Tainan City, starting April 22, water taps in 76 large parks under its jurisdiction, except for public restrooms, were shut off to enforce water-saving measures, with an estimated monthly water savings of about 2,000 tons. Additionally, starting April 26, water supply to saunas, car washes, and swimming pools was stopped. Some car wash operators expressed dissatisfaction after being notified, as the regulations only controlled legal operators but failed to restrict illegal ones. Schools also temporarily suspended swimming classes. To encourage water conservation among residents and businesses, the Tainan City Government introduced incentive measures, offering vouchers worth thousands of dollars for meeting specified water-saving targets. Since the suspension of water supply to swimming pools would affect athlete training, considering the importance of uninterrupted training and the impact of competition results on educational advancement, four public swimming pools were designated as centralized training bases for Tainan swimming athletes.  \n\nThe Kaohsiung City Government's Sports Development Bureau announced that starting April 1, six self-managed public swimming pools—Qijin, Sanmin, Gushan, Youchang, Jiaxian, and Dongmen—would be closed. Starting April 19, all 10 self-managed public swimming pools under the bureau (International Pool, Sanmin Pool, Xinxing Pool, Qijin Pool, Gushan Pool, Zuoying Pool, Youchang Pool, Nanzi Pool, Jiaxian Pool, and Dongmen Pool) would suspend operations in line with the city's water restriction and drought response measures. Outsourced and managed swimming pools would not replenish new water but would enhance water filtration frequency to maintain water quality. Additionally, the four swimming pools at incinerator feedback facilities (Central, Southern, Gangshan, and Renwu) under the Kaohsiung City Environmental Protection Bureau reduced their daily sessions from four to two starting April 1. However, due to the continued severity of the water situation, these four swimming pools were completely closed starting April 19 and would reopen only after the water alert was lifted.  \n\nKaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai announced on April 16 that starting April 17, tap water supply to car washes and public and private swimming pools would be stopped. Additionally, the Southern Region Water Resources Office and the Water Corporation initiated a well-drilling project, aiming to increase daily water supply by 160,000 tons by the end of the month and up to 300,000 tons in May to ensure that Kaohsiung's water situation does not enter the red alert stage of \"5 days on, 2 days off.\""

Following ancient traditions, the ceremony included offerings to the Rain God and the Shangyang bird, with 3,000 attendees dressed in white and holding incense for worship. Jenn Lann Temple Chairman Yen Ching-piao and Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen, along with five directors from water and agricultural departments, participated throughout. On March 15, the Taoyuan Ferry Yacht Association held a Mazu water pilgrimage event, inviting the Shui Zhong Tudi Gong from Baiji Fuxing Temple and 28 temples from the Daxi area to join. A total of 18 boats participated in a nearly three-hour lake pilgrimage at Shimen Reservoir to pray for blessings and rain. On April 14, Xiantian Temple in Dongshi, Chiayi County, held its first rain prayer ceremony in 300 years, burning 17 green dragons and 7,000 longevity gold papers on-site to petition the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas for rain to alleviate the drought. On April 17, residents of the Sun Moon Lake area initiated a rain prayer event, welcoming Mazu from the Tainan Zhengyi Luermen Mazu Temple. Participants carried Mazu statues around the lake, took boats, and rode cable cars, conducting a \"land, sea, and air\" pilgrimage to pray for rain. In Dalin Township, Chiayi County, Shengxian Temple held a \"Rain Prayer Grand Ceremony\" for Guan Sheng Dijun's return, with Chiayi County Magistrate Weng Chang-liang wearing traditional Han attire to lead the prayer. On April 18, Lingxiao Baodian Wulong Temple in Yongkang District, Tainan City, held a rain prayer ceremony led by 11 Taoist priests.

        "content": "From the afternoon of April 28 to the morning of April 29, a relatively complete frontal rainband passed through Taiwan, bringing brief showers or thunderstorms to areas from central to northern Taiwan and the northeastern region, as well as brief showers or thunderstorms in the southern mountainous areas. This provided more abundant rainfall for counties and cities in central and northern Taiwan, with reservoirs receiving some inflow. As of 4 p.m. on April 29, the total rainfall across Taiwan was 15.97 million tons, equivalent to 1.5 days of water usage for the entire island. However, due to the rapid movement of this frontal system, significant relief from drought is still expected to come during the plum rain season.\n\nOn May 24-25, a frontal system approached Taiwan, with vigorous development of convective cloud systems, leading to short-term heavy rainfall in the afternoon across various regions. Not only did heavy rain fall in Taipei and New Taipei City, but localized heavy rain also occurred in the mountainous areas of Keelung, Yilan, northern Kaohsiung, and Hualien. This rainfall brought approximately 18.15 million tons of water to Taiwan, with the Feitsui Reservoir and Shimen Reservoir benefiting the most, positively impacting water conditions. However, southern reservoirs gained little from this rainfall and still faced water shortages. Nevertheless, the increased flow in the Gaoping River and the improved storage rate of Chengqing Lake eased water conditions in the Kaohsiung area, changing the water alert signal to a yellow light.\n\nFrom May 30 to June 1, a more complete plum rain front brought significant rainfall to Taiwan, resulting in positive growth in reservoir storage rates across the island. The estimated inflow to reservoirs nationwide was 136 million tons, equivalent to two weeks of water usage for the entire island. The Water Resources Agency estimated that the Shimen Reservoir in the north benefited the most, with an inflow of approximately 26 million tons. However, storage rates remained low, and several more rain events would be needed to fully alleviate the drought.\n\nFrom June 4 to June 6, Typhoon Choi-wan and a plum rain front brought abundant rainfall to Taiwan, easing water conditions. This plum rain front contributed approximately 210 million tons of rainfall to reservoir catchment areas across the island. The Feitsui Reservoir in Taipei received about 42 million tons, while the Shimen, Baoshan, and Baoshan Second Reservoirs collectively gained 16.56 million tons. In central Taiwan, the Yongheshan, Liyutan, and Deji Reservoirs collectively increased by 22.7 million tons. The Sun Moon Lake and Wushe Reservoirs in Nantou gained about 11 million tons, the Nanhua Reservoir in Tainan about 32.1 million tons, and the Zengwen and Wushantou Reservoirs about 41 million tons. This rainfall also allowed the red light water rationing measures in Taichung and northern Changhua to be lifted, with Changhua and Yunlin switching to green light water reminders, and Nantou and Kaohsiung returning to normal water conditions.\n\nFrom June 21 to June 25, a plum rain front lingered near Taiwan, bringing rainfall across the island. The Central Weather Bureau stated that the most significant impact of this stationary front occurred on June 22 and 23, with the main rainfall areas being the western half and northeastern regions. Meteorologist Wu Derong, reflecting on the soon-to-end plum rain season on June 25, noted that although three typical stationary plum rain fronts brought rainfall, without the additional two mobile fronts, consecutive afternoon thunderstorms, and the southwest monsoon delivering substantial rainfall to central and southern Taiwan, the record-breaking 56-year drought would not have been so easily alleviated.\n\nFrom July 23 to July 25, Typhoon In-Fa passed over the northeastern waters of Taiwan, prompting the Central Weather Bureau to issue a sea typhoon warning. Although Typhoon In-Fa did not make landfall in Taiwan, its outer circulation brought abundant rainfall to areas from central to northern Taiwan, with an estimated reservoir inflow benefit of approximately 330 million tons. This rainfall effectively replenished reservoirs in central and northern Taiwan, returning water conditions to normal in Taoyuan and Miaoli, and changing Taichung's water alert from an orange light for reduced water supply to a yellow light for reduced pressure water supply.\n\nFrom July 31 to August 1, Taiwan was affected by a southwest airflow, resulting in significant rainfall in areas south of Taichung. Rainfall accumulation reached 521 mm and 512.5 mm in Yuyoushan, Kaohsiung, and Dahan Mountain, Pingtung, respectively. Several towns experienced flooding and waterlogging, with some roads disrupted. The Central Weather Bureau named this event the \"110731 Southwest Airflow Heavy Rain Event.\" This heavy rain brought approximately 100 million tons of precipitation to Taiwan, with the Nanhua Reservoir and Zengwen Reservoir benefiting the most. Although the Deji and Wushe Reservoirs in the central mountainous region received rainfall, their recovery was slower.\n\nFrom August 6 to August 8, after Typhoon Lupit weakened into a tropical depression upon making landfall in Fujian Province, it turned and made landfall in Taiwan, bringing several days of disastrous heavy rain. From 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August 7, a total of over 2.3 billion tons of rainfall was recorded in just six hours."

From August to October, precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and areas south of it was about 90% less than usual, resulting in severe to extreme summer-autumn consecutive droughts. Temperatures in August were 2 to 4 degrees Celsius higher than usual, with some areas 4 to 6 degrees higher, and the abnormal high temperatures covered the severely drought-affected regions. With the end of the East Asian summer monsoon, the drought area shrank somewhat from November to December [1]."

From July to August in summer, the Yangtze River Basin was under the control of the westward-extending Western Pacific Subtropical High, making it difficult for cold air from the north to move southward, which was unfavorable for precipitation [4]. Against the backdrop of climate warming, the probability of concurrent high-temperature and drought events has significantly increased, further exacerbating the drought conditions in the Yangtze River Basin [1]."

        "content": "Since the 1990s, the agro-export industry has grown significantly, increasing the demand for water for crops that require large amounts of this resource, such as avocados. This claim is emphatically denied by representatives of the area's agro-industry, whose business representatives argue that avocados consume less water than other species, attributing the scarce water availability to the \"lack of state investment in reservoir and irrigation infrastructure.\" The water crisis has had a devastating impact on the communities of Petorca. Many families have lost access to drinking water and are forced to rely on water trucks for supply, which represents a significant cost and an additional burden in their lives. Additionally, the lack of water has affected family farming, which used to be a source of livelihood and trade for the region's inhabitants. Since 2006, rainfall in the area has not reached normal yearly levels, affecting the available flows for human consumption and agricultural use. In 2010, MODATIMA emerged, an organization dedicated to defending the right to water access for farmers, workers, and residents of the Petorca province. Due to the reduction of flow in the Petorca, La Ligua, and Aconcagua river basins, on November 24, 2010, the Ministry of Public Works declared a water emergency for these valleys in the Valparaíso region. On February 9, an agricultural emergency was declared in seven communes of the Valparaíso region: La Ligua, Petorca, Cabildo, Zapallar, Papudo, Putaendo, and Nogales. In 2014, the National Institute of Human Rights issued a report on the water crisis, where up to 65 illegal drainage works were found diverted for avocado cultivation. In 2016, during the administration of Governor Mario Fuentes Romero in Michelle Bachelet's second government, the province of Petorca was declared a water scarcity zone. This allowed for the provision of water truck services to deliver water to the population. As a long-term solution, it was proposed to direct water from the Aconcagua and Maipo rivers, among other measures. In 2017, only 4,763 hectares of avocado trees were surveyed in the basin, a 45% decrease compared to 2008. In 2018, 4,778 people had to receive drinking water supply via water trucks. Sebastián Piñera's second government implemented strict control of wells from which water is extracted, the formation and empowerment of Vigilance Boards among farmers to monitor and demand compliance with the law, and allocated a budget of $173,000,000 for the construction of the Las Palmas reservoir with a capacity of 55 million cubic meters, set to begin operations in 2024. Another less advanced project is the construction of the Pedernal reservoir with 31 million cubic meters for the irrigation of 1,800 hectares. In Los Quinquelles, a coastal area of the La Ligua commune, a desalination plant has been built. In 2020, the water scarcity in the La Ligua and Petorca areas was addressed in the episode \"Avocado Wars\" of the Netflix series Rotten."

        "content": "The forest fires in Chubut were a natural disaster (although in some areas their origins seem to have been caused by human action) that occurred in the province of Chubut, in Argentina. The fire began on February 15, 2015, and the provincial government declared a state of environmental emergency on February 25, lasting until the beginning of April when the period of intense autumn rains greatly helped extinguish it. It mainly affected Cholila and other localities located in the northwest of Chubut. The fire started in the Cholila Lake valley, on its shores, near the coordinates 42°27′S 71°44′W / -42.450, -71.733. On April 6, 2015, it was reported that the burned forest area was over 41,000 hectares of virgin forests (almost the same size as Andorra), becoming the most significant fire on record in Argentina, with an area of over 41,000 hectares of native forests affected, surpassed seven years later by the fires in Corrientes in 2022. The fires were concentrated in the Comarca de los Alerces, in the Cholila Lake valley, on its southern and northern margins, in Cerro Cholila, and in the El Turco and Tucu Tucu canyons, with outbreaks in the Jara stream, the Turbio River, and Cerro Radal. It spread to the north and south, reaching the southern part of the Andean Region of Parallel 42, in Lago Puelo and Cerro Currumahuida, having reached the namesake national park to the north and entering Los Alerces National Park to the south. It is the largest forest fire in Argentina's history. In certain areas of the affected region, the outbreaks seem to have been caused by human action, so on Sunday, March 1, some people accused of starting fires were arrested. If the fires in this tourist region were intentionally caused, it was motivated by real estate speculation to later acquire the valuable affected lands at a low price."

The weather conditions were unfavorable due to the phenomenon known as thermal inversion. Internal work was carried out in the forest to prevent the fire from advancing, such as creating 40-meter-wide firebreaks. In addition to the 150 brigade members working on-site and dozens of volunteer neighbors, teams from the City of Neuquén and San Martín de los Andes (from the province of Neuquén), the Province of Buenos Aires, and the Province of Santa Cruz joined the efforts. From the Republic of Chile, three helicopters were sent to stop the fire column. Finally, after 17 days, thanks to the great efforts made by the brigade members and favorable environmental and meteorological conditions, such as a decrease in temperatures in the area, the fire's advance was controlled on the afternoon of March 4, even in the most critical areas. However, on March 23 of the same year, new intentionally set fires appeared in Los Alerces and Puelo National Parks. When the fires seemed extinguished, they reappeared at the end of March (also due to intentional causes), so by the 30th of that month, a large number of ancient and beautiful forests were still being destroyed. On Saturday, April 4, intense autumn rains began to extinguish the main fire hotspots, which led to the return of firefighting brigades from the province of Córdoba, as they were deemed no longer necessary. On the same day (after more than a month of devastating fires), Civil Defense announced that all the fires in Chubut were under control."

Governor Martín Buzzi denounced and accused the real estate sector of causing three of the five fire outbreaks in Cerro Currumahuida and Lago Puelo. He also mentioned: Argentine Defense Minister Agustín Rossi reported that the Armed Forces would increase support for the brigades working in the province of Chubut to combat the fires. On December 28, 2012, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner announced to the public the purchase of 26 firefighting planes for AR$ 57 million, modified to drop up to 2,000 liters of water over affected areas, and the rest of the firefighting planes are distributed among the different provinces due to the higher number of fires recorded during the summer months. Due to the magnitude of the event, the Chilean government provided helicopters from the first days of March. On March 14, 2015, the governor of Chubut announced the creation of the Cholila Interjurisdictional Park. It will cover an area of 220,000 hectares, with intangible zones and areas subject to a management plan.

O'Reilly owns the private neighborhood San Esteban in Cholila, covering about 1,000 hectares and 160 plots.

        "content": "The fire originated from a lightning strike. On Tuesday, July 7, the fire was brought under control, but due to strong winds and high temperatures recorded during those days of the heatwave, the fire reignited. The front advanced southward, reaching the outskirts of the urban areas of Pozo Alcón, Huesa, and Larva, and in a few hours, the affected area increased from 200 to 1,800 hectares and surpassed 2,000 hectares shortly after. It developed on two fronts: the southwest front headed toward Alicún de Ortega in the province of Granada, while the southeast front moved toward Guadiana Menor and Hinojares, where a firebreak was constructed. On July 9, \"Level 1\" of the Forest Fire Emergency Plan was activated. The fire remained outside the boundaries of the Cazorla, Segura, and Las Villas Natural Park, about 15 kilometers away, although part of the burned area is of great ecological value, with centuries-old pines, as well as mastic trees, junipers, low forest, and other species typical of the dry Mediterranean climate. Likewise, a large area of reforested Aleppo pine, highly flammable, was destroyed, which had been attempting, with little success, to prevent the advance of desertification spreading from the Levante Almeriense to the north of the province of Granada. As a precaution, 29 people were evacuated from the hamlet of Ceal, Chíllar farmhouse, and Cortijo Nuevo, all belonging to Huesa, as the strong wind carried embers over a thousand meters away, rendering firebreaks and other preventive measures ineffective. The fire also affected several agricultural and livestock areas, burning olive groves and pastures. On Sunday, July 12, the fire was stabilized, moving from Level 1 to Level 0, which allowed the withdrawal of the UME. The remaining resources on-site took appropriate measures to prevent its resurgence, as another heatwave with extreme maximum temperatures occurred in the following days. Evacuated residents were also authorized to return to their homes. Initial estimates, after the fire level decreased, calculated a burned area exceeding 8,000 hectares, although later this figure rose to 10,000 hectares, still not under control. However, other estimates raised the burned area to 14,000 hectares. INFOCA declared the fire under control on the morning of July 15, and it was officially extinguished in the early afternoon of July 29, after twenty-five days."

In the previous reforestation, Pinus halepensis was mainly used. The first reforestation works began in the autumn of 2015, for which the Junta de Andalucía approved a budget allocation of 2.12 million euros. A year later, the first results began to be seen."

In 2005 and 2006, a team of scientists conducted pedestrian surveys that provided a better understanding of the lives of the inhabitants of the destroyed area from the Paleolithic to the 20th century. These discoveries were documented in a large-format collective work of 504 pages published in 2009, titled \"Archaeology of a Burned Mountain.\" The multidisciplinary study led to the discovery of 74 previously unknown archaeological sites and clarified knowledge of several others: the ruined villages of Ropidera and Casesnoves, as well as two protohistoric oppida. It also showed that the history of settlement in this area, since the Paleolithic, experienced alternating periods of prosperity and decline, or even abandonment. However, it should be noted that the research did not involve excavations, leaving many questions unanswered. It demonstrated human presence on the site since the final Acheulean and Middle Paleolithic, as well as an absence of Neolithic traces, which may suggest the plateau was abandoned during that time. The main contribution of this research lies in the Bronze Age, beginning in the Chalcolithic, with around fifty sites discovered, allowing the reconstruction of the lifestyle of the inhabitants of the time: herders and artisans whose dwellings were centered around an oppidum located on a height, secondary habitats on the slopes, and pastures for livestock in the valleys. Their craftsmanship, in chloritoschist, is unique and not found at any other archaeological site in the region. From the end of the Bronze Age to the Carolingian period, the plateau does not appear to have been inhabited. The fire allowed for the mapping of the village of Ropidera, in good condition, as it was at the time of its abandonment around the 15th century: large stone houses composed of several rooms with enclosures for livestock attached to the dwellings. The size and complexity of the layouts of these houses are surprising, as well as their grouping: in other nearby mountainous areas like Vallespir, medieval settlements are dispersed (Catalan mas). Not far from Ropidera, a kiln of undetermined age was also discovered, likely used for firing clay tiles. The fire also revealed an old pink marble quarry at the southern edge of the burned area, in the commune of Bouleternère. Many medieval buildings in the department use pink marble, which is usually attributed to the quarries of Villefranche-de-Conflent. The discovery of the Bouleternère quarries could challenge this systematic attribution. Nearby, the fire also uncovered a lime kiln likely dating back at least to the late Middle Ages."

The most affected areas were in locations with remote homes and sparse forests. According to sources from the Ministry of the Environment of the Government of the Canary Islands, a quarter of Gran Canaria was affected, with approximately 20,000 hectares; in the fires on La Gomera and Tenerife, nearly 19,000 hectares were burned. In Gran Canaria, the most affected areas were the municipalities of La Aldea de San Nicolás, Tejeda, San Bartolomé de Tirajana, Santa Lucía de Tirajana, Mogán, and San Mateo. In the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the most affected areas were the north of Tenerife and La Gomera.

Its origin was a barbecue that some hikers neglected at a picnic area near the Casares cave in the municipality of Riba de Saelices. A total of 10,352.57 hectares of wooded land burned, mostly consisting of resin pine, juniper, and oak forests, 2,380.16 hectares of scrubland and pasture, and 154.64 hectares of non-forest surface. The fire devastated 2,400 hectares of high ecological value belonging to the Alto Tajo natural park. Around half a thousand people were evacuated, including entire populations such as Ciruelos del Pinar and Tobillos, among others. The management of the fire by the government of Castilla-La Mancha was harshly criticized from various sectors, alleging that the necessary aerial and ground resources were not sent during the first hours. These criticisms were based, among other things, on the 112 recordings and the fact that the alert level was only raised, and help was requested from the central government when the tragic news of the eleven deaths was known, as acknowledged by the then vice president of the Junta, Máximo Díaz Cano. On December 17, 2005, nearly 5,000 people according to the police, and 10,000 according to the organizers, demonstrated in Guadalajara to honor the deceased and demand accountability."

        "content": "On the morning of Saturday, July 16, 2005, a group of nine hikers visited the Casares cave with the subsequent intention of preparing a barbecue at the picnic area located on the left bank of the Linares River, about one hundred meters from the cave entrance. While the majority of the group visited the cave guided by the caretaker Emilio Moreno, the other three members prepared a fire on two built-in grills located in the recreational area and fueled it with dry grass, branches, and pinecones collected from the surroundings. At the end of the visit, the caretaker noticed the fires and warned them that the use of the barbecues was authorized but that he strongly advised against it due to the strong wind blowing in the area, the high temperatures—over 33°C—and the abundance of dry stubble: \"I told Marcelino that he could cause trouble with the weather that day. Not even the dumbest person in my village would think of making a barbecue on a day like that, with an infernal wind and next to stubble. That’s just not having any sense.\" Around 2:40 PM, a spark or ember fell from the southernmost barbecue, which was unattended, igniting the dry grass, and the fire quickly spread northeast through the riparian forest and cereal fields until it reached a forested area of resin pine. The fire, fanned by the strong wind, became uncontrollable and by mid-afternoon forced the evacuation of five hundred residents from the towns of Ciruelos del Pinar, Tobillos, and Mazarete. Ground crews fought the fire throughout the night, and by dawn on Sunday, July 17, it had two active fronts heading toward Cobeta and Luzón, respectively. Throughout the day, more resources joined the fight against the fire, which already included three land-based water-loading planes, two seaplanes—two more joined late in the afternoon—two helicopters, fifteen heavy machinery teams, two BRIF units, as well as several ground crews and teams from the Guadalajara Provincial Firefighting Consortium. Throughout Sunday, July 17, the residents of Mazarete were able to return to their town, but the fire remained active on three fronts: Mazarete-Anquela-Selas, Ciruelos del Pinar-Luzón-Santa María del Espino, and another, irregular one, reaching Villarejo de Medina. The most concerning front was the one threatening Luzón and Santa María del Espino, and at 6:00 PM, the evacuation of both towns was ordered. The GU-951 road, between Ciruelos del Pinar and Mazarete; the GU-944, between Mazarete and Cobeta; and the GU-949, between Mazarete and Ablanque, were closed. The CM-2107 road was only open for firefighting services. Late in the afternoon, rumors began circulating about the deaths of several members of the Cogolludo crew trapped by the fire. At 9:30 PM, the Guadalajara Government Subdelegation confirmed these rumors, and a few hours later, the bodies of eleven forest agents—ten men and one woman—were found on the slope of a ravine. Only one member of the crew survived, having found refuge under the stream of water falling from the damaged truck in which they had tried to escape the flames. On Monday, July 18, the bodies of the firefighters were recovered, and the fronts threatening the towns of Santa María del Espino, Luzón, Tobillos, Mazarete, Anquela del Ducado, and Villarejo de Medina were brought under control. On July 20, all active fronts of the fire were successfully controlled."

The trial took place in the Provincial Court of Guadalajara between 2009 and 2012 and concluded with a verdict in which only one of the hikers was convicted of a forest fire offense caused by gross negligence, receiving a sentence of two years in prison, a fine of €3,650, and compensation of €10,640,971.14 to the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha for damages caused by the fire. This sentence was appealed by the convicted individual and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2013."

The fire not only caused the affected area to lose a large part of its natural heritage but also severely impacted the livelihood of part of its population, who depend on the exploitation and conservation of the natural environment and the tourism sector. During its progression, there were particularly critical moments, as the flames reached the vicinity of a fish farm in the Aliaga area that contained eight gas tanks at risk of exploding. And especially because they reached the town of La Cañadilla (Aliaga), where two buildings were burned down. Due to the complexity of extinguishing it and the dangers to health and safety caused by the fire and dense smoke, the residents of La Cañadilla, Cirujeda, La Zoma, Cañizar del Olivar, Ejulve, and Montoro de Mezquita were evacuated from their homes, the A-2403 road between Aliaga and Ejulve was closed, as well as the A-1702 road between Villarluengo and Ejulve. The flames in this last locality came as close as half a kilometer to its urban center. Another direct consequence was the suspension of the fourth edition of the Carrasca Rock music festival, which was scheduled to take place in Ejulve on July 24 and 25, three days after the fire began."

Likewise, the CCOO union stated in a report on forest fires that the development of this fire was due to the forest's uncleanliness and the significant lack of preventive measures, with excess undergrowth and dry pines in the forest, as well as the absence of clean paths and trails that would have facilitated the extinction tasks for vehicles and forest workers. The Department, for its part, argued that in 1995 and 1996, significant forestry work was carried out on about 90 hectares of this forest, consisting of thinning, enhancement pruning, and waste removal. The forest is publicly owned, belonging to the Pegalajar town council. A total of 119 people, a forest fire vehicle, three helicopters, a ground-loading plane, and the Mobile Meteorology and Transmissions Unit participated in extinguishing the fire.

The fire location is at a high altitude, with fast and unpredictable wind speeds, and the terrain is extremely steep, with many areas lacking formed roads, all of which pose challenges to firefighting efforts.\n\nMuli County currently has 941,400 hectares of forestry land, including 620,000 hectares of forested land, with a forest coverage rate of 67.3% and a standing timber volume of 117 million cubic meters, accounting for 10% of the province and 1% of the nation. It is one of the few remaining contiguous primary forest areas in mainland China. Therefore, Muli County is known as \"One Muli, Half Forest.\"\n\nThe Muli forest area belongs to the northern hemisphere's subtropical monsoon climate zone, with distinct wet and dry seasons and an average annual precipitation of 818 millimeters. From November to June of the following year, precipitation accounts for less than 10% of the annual total, the air is dry, and there are many windy days. Additionally, the wind direction in the forest area changes abnormally with the terrain, and the forest area contains many flammable coniferous tree species with a thick humus layer.

Initially classified as a large-scale fire, subsequent investigations confirmed it was caused by a lightning strike. The lightning struck a Yunnan pine tree approximately 18 meters tall with a diameter of over 250 centimeters at chest height. The lightning split the tree trunk, and the electrical discharge traveled through the trunk to the ground, igniting the surface humus layer and causing the fire. \n\nThe county and prefectural governments activated emergency response plans, organizing the Liangshan Forest Fire Brigade's Xichang Battalion and local professional rescue teams to extinguish the fire. A total of 689 firefighters were deployed, with the number of personnel reaching over 700 at its peak. On the afternoon of the 31st, due to a sudden change in wind direction, the wildfire experienced a flashover, resulting in 30 firefighters going missing, including 27 forest fire brigade members and 3 local firefighting personnel. According to a surviving commander from the Xichang Fire Brigade, the firefighters had already suppressed the fire, leaving only two small ignition points. However, smoke was still rising from the ground, accompanied by crackling sounds. They began to retreat in two groups, but less than a minute later, the forest suddenly experienced a flashover, with flames shooting up tens of meters high. The firefighters who couldn't escape in time were engulfed by the flames and tragically lost their lives.\n\nOn April 1, the bodies of all 30 missing firefighters were recovered. As of 5:00 PM on April 1, the burned area had reached approximately 15 hectares, and the fire remained difficult to control. At 6:30 AM on April 2, 250 reinforcements from the Sichuan Armed Police Corps, including 100 from the Panzhihua Detachment and 150 from the Chengdu Detachment, were dispatched to the fire site. After on-site inspections, the open flames at the fire site were extinguished, with only a few smoke points remaining on cliffs, and the threat of fire spread was eliminated.\n\nIn the early hours of April 2, a convoy carrying the bodies of the missing personnel arrived in Xichang City. That evening, the second batch of six fallen heroes' remains was transported to Xichang. At 10:00 AM on April 2, the Muli County People's Government in Liangshan Prefecture received the first compensation payment of 1.8 million yuan from the \"Huinongbao\" natural disaster public liability insurance provided by China People's Insurance Company, compensating the families of the 30 firefighters who perished in the \"3.30\" forest fire.\n\nSome surviving firefighters from the Xichang Fire Brigade exhibited acute stress reactions, including frequent sighing, recurring flashbacks of the incident, and difficulty sleeping. Starting April 6, experts from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences began providing psychological support. Currently, the firefighters are in the \"stress response period,\" and the experts are focusing on addressing various emotional stress issues."

Among them, 27 were members of the Liangshan Forest Fire Brigade, including 22 Han, 1 Manchu, 1 Li, 2 Yi, and 1 She. On the same day, the 31st executive meeting of the 11th Liangshan Prefecture Government discussed matters related to the posthumous recognition of those who died in the \"3.30\" forest fire in Muli as martyrs. It was determined that Yang Dawa, Zou Ping, and Ba Jin met the relevant conditions and requirements for martyr recognition, and it was decided to submit the application to the Sichuan Provincial People's Government for approval in the name of the prefectural government. The other 27 fallen officers and soldiers of the Liangshan Forest Fire Brigade had already been reported through relevant channels for martyr recognition. The 27 forest firefighters who died in the line of duty were posthumously awarded first-class merit, and 11 were posthumously recognized as members of the Communist Party of China. Wang Huirong, deputy director of the third reforestation and management office of the Muli Forestry Bureau in Sichuan Province, went missing during the firefighting efforts and was found dead at 3:15 p.m. on April 4. The cause of death was determined to be fractures caused by a fall, with bone fragments piercing blood vessels, leading to death from hemorrhagic shock."

Most of the firefighters who perished were born in the 1990s, and many mainland netizens expressed their condolences on social media platforms. On April 1, a netizen named Yin Mouyun (male, 30 years old, from Bijie City, Guizhou Province) with the Baidu account \"Tornado Waiting for You\" was accused of posting remarks insulting the firefighters on the Baidu platform, causing a negative impact. Yin Mouyun, suspected of the crime of provoking trouble, was arrested and criminally detained in Quanzhou, Fujian. The official WeChat public account of the Ministry of Emergency Management angrily denounced him as \"scum,\" and Yin Mouyun released a video apologizing. Subsequently, as of April 4, reports from various regions indicated that 12 more netizens were arrested for \"insulting the fallen firefighting heroes.\" On April 2, a man named Dai Mou was detained for posting insulting remarks about firefighters in the comments section of the Douyin app. On April 5, the police in Panyu District, Guangzhou, reported that a netizen named Zhao Mou had continuously posted defamatory and insulting remarks about the firefighters in a WeChat group and on Sina Weibo, causing a negative impact. Zhao Mou was criminally detained by the police on suspicion of provoking trouble. On April 6, a netizen named Li Moumou, originally from Hebei and residing in Tianjin's Binhai New Area, posted insulting remarks about the fallen firefighting heroes under a blog post mourning the \"30 firefighters who perished in the Sichuan Liangshan forest fire.\" He was arrested by the Binhai New Area Public Security Bureau at around 9 p.m. that day and was criminally detained on April 7 on suspicion of provoking trouble. On April 8, a local \"Weibo influencer\" in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, named Ma Chengliang (35 years old), used the account \"Ma's Zhenyuan Planning\" in his \"Ma's Metaphysics Anti-Fraud\" WeChat group to publicly post insulting remarks about the Liangshan fire firefighters. During interrogation, it was revealed that his Weibo followers numbered 510,000. Ma Chengliang was later criminally detained for the crime of provoking trouble. On April 9, a man named Yang Mou in Kunming was arrested for posting insulting remarks about the fallen Liangshan firefighters in his WeChat Moments. Preliminary investigations revealed that Yang Mou had been beaten by Zheng Mou and, in retaliation, used Zheng Mou's ID photo and posted in Zheng Mou's tone a WeChat Moment saying \"Come and catch me if you dare.\" Yang Mou was later criminally detained on suspicion of \"provoking trouble,\" while Zheng Mou was administratively punished for assaulting others. After confirming the deaths of rescue personnel, multiple sports events in China, including the fourth round of the Chinese Super League and the CBA quarterfinals, arranged moments of silence before the games to mourn the fallen rescue personnel. On April 3, football player Cristiano Ronaldo posted on Weibo to mourn the \"brave firefighters\" in the fire. In response to some public doubts about the necessity of firefighting and the high number of casualties, Bai Ye, the director of the teaching and research office at the China Fire and Rescue Academy, stated on April 3 that the forest fire in Muli County had to be extinguished. Otherwise, if left to burn naturally, the fire could further expand, endangering nearby villages and towns and causing greater property and personnel losses. Additionally, the main reason for the high number of firefighter casualties was the \"sudden flashover of the mountain fire,\" not a lack of professionalism in the team."

The fire started at approximately 9:30 PM on Saturday in the La Peñuela area of Moguer, a pine forest and agricultural zone near the Doñana Natural Space, and spread rapidly due to strong gusts of wind. On Sunday, June 25, roads in the area were closed, isolating 50,000 people in Matalascañas. Additionally, the Iberian lynx captive breeding center \"El Acebuche\" was evacuated, with the cubs being transferred to other centers and the adult specimens released. The fire lasted a total of 10 days and was extinguished on July 4. The fire was caused by negligence at a charcoal production site due to the use of illegal ovens."

        "content": "The 2019 forest fire in Bolivia refers to a series of fires that occurred between July and October 2019, considered one of the most severe ecological disasters in the last 10 years. The fires were located in the tropical regions of the Chiquitano forest—considered a public good of our planet—the Bolivian Amazon, and the western Pantanal, affecting populations such as Roboré, Puerto Busch, and San Ignacio de Velasco among the eight regions directly involved in the department of Santa Cruz and also in the department of Beni in Bolivia. It also endangered municipal reserves such as Tucabaca, Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, or Ñembi Guasu, territory of uncontacted Ayoreo peoples. This event resulted in the loss of five million hectares of Chiquitania dry forest, whose land use is forestal and which in recent years has been converted into agricultural production land without prior consultation with the communities inhabiting the region. Fires caused by direct human action are a significant reason for forest loss in the Amazon basin. This situation has sparked controversy over the government's role in control and prevention measures, which experts have described as one of the most complex disasters in Latin America. Similarly, actions taken to control the disaster, such as the initial refusal to request international aid during the crisis, have been criticized."

        "content": "At the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, the agricultural frontier in Bolivia expanded rapidly, especially in the departments of Santa Cruz and Beni, causing deforestation and savannization of territories to enable them as spaces for livestock raising and export crops, affecting tropical forests, grasslands, and cane fields. One of the most widespread practices for vegetation removal is the so-called \"chaqueo,\" a practice consisting of burning vegetation cover similar to slash-and-burn. A 2010 report by the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) Foundation placed Bolivia among the countries with the highest deforestation rates, almost tripling Brazil's rate. At that rate of forest loss, the disappearance of forests in Bolivia was predicted by 2100. On April 26, 2019, Foreign Minister Diego Pary and the Minister of China's Customs Administration, Ni Yuefeng, signed a protocol to export 20,000 tons of meat to China, which means $75 million in revenue for the country. For this, it is necessary to expand from 13 million hectares of livestock use to 20 million, as stated in the 2020-2030 Livestock Development Plan, which was presented by ranchers to the President of Bolivia. Miguel Ángel Crespo, an expert in agroecology, predicts that this type of agro-extractivism exacerbates droughts, floods, climate changes, pest outbreaks, and soil erosion. According to Natalia Calderón, director of the Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza (FAN), 60% of deforestation is due to livestock farming, and significant deforestation expansion has been detected in Charagua and the Chiquitania in Santa Cruz, as reported on July 5. Juan Carlos Ojopi, a member of the Amazon Defense Committee of the Madera River Basin in the department of Beni, expressed his outright rejection, as it endorses the deforestation of lands they were reforesting themselves, fearing that all their work will be cleared and burned. A report by the Amazon Network of Georeferenced Socio-Environmental Information (RAISG) states that Bolivia lost 18.7 million hectares of forests due to clearings and fires between 2005 and 2018."

Experts from the USA, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and other countries stated they had never seen a fire of such magnitude in equatorial forests and identified four factors that contributed to the emergence of such a large fire: drought, high temperatures, winds, and human activity. The experts affirm that the disaster is extreme and suggest the use of heavy machinery to implement firebreaks at a distance. According to Enrique Bruno: \"They have a proposal, the only reliable proposal means all the work with machinery creating firebreak lines at a distance, many machines will be needed, we need more bulldozers in all the fire areas. This is a priority, and the Government must take it as such because this is already overwhelming.\" As of September 17, there are three fire fronts according to monitoring technician and biologist Suri Cabrera Barea: Fire hotspots are being sought by land and satellite, when the winds are from the south the fire decreases and becomes imperceptible, but when it shifts to the north it becomes uncontrollable, many hotspots multiply, and those that had been fought reignite. The expert points out: \"The personnel is insufficient for the number of hotspots that multiply, especially on days with higher temperatures and wind. Volunteer firefighters with the greatest possible autonomy are needed, volunteers with drones to help identify heat points, more bulldozers (the fire needs to be stopped with heavy machinery), more water tanks, chainsaw operators with their tools, uniforms for volunteer firefighters, tools, backpacks.\" Community members, firefighters, and volunteers report a lack of machinery and equipment, which makes the fight against the fire much longer.

A flagship case of this shelter is that of the anteater Valentina, who arrived with all four paws burned and fell into a coma upon entering the shelter, according to veterinarian Flora Cecilia Dorado. They fear that after the fires stop, people will forget about the rehabilitation of the animals.[113] Efforts were made to rescue animals that are partially burned, dehydrated, and malnourished.[114] There is talk of animals wandering in the burned forests, which makes them easier targets for illegal hunting as they are more visible.[115] Toucans and other types of wildlife have also been seen arriving in the city.[citation needed]"

        "content": "During the development of the forest fire, various data have been presented regarding the number of species affected by the event. As the fire progressed and new ecosystems were destroyed, the figures have increased. By the end of September, the fire persisted, so the analyses and quantifications carried out are partial and subject to later reevaluations that may yield higher numbers. Around 500 animal species are at risk in the Chiquitanía alone. In general, more than 1,200 species, including insects like bees, 43 amphibians, 140 reptiles, 788 birds, and 242 mammals, are suffering the consequences of this disaster. During firefighting operations, firefighters have found various evidence of animals that fell victim to the fires, such as reptiles and charred mammals, as well as others fleeing to areas unaffected by the fires, like puma cubs. One of the animals most at risk is the Ameerega boehmei frog, an endemic species that can only be found in the Chiquitano Dry Forest (BSC). There is fear that the fire may reach the territory of the blue macaw. In an evaluation conducted by Ciencia Bolivia and the College of Biologists of La Paz, it was determined that around 1,600 species were lost in the fire. According to Iván Arnold, executive director of the Nature, Land, and Life Foundation (Nativa), the few animals that remain in the fire-affected area are destined to die because they lack food sources and water. Burned peccaries can be observed, which, despite being fast, could not escape, demonstrating how voracious the fire can be. For him, the only way to recover the area is to declare it untouchable and prevent human interference. For Mónica Negrete, a veterinary graduate and activist in the area, she believes that many animals may disappear as they were already endangered. She thinks the jaguar is the most likely to disappear since, without a pack, it must move to nearby areas to find food and may reach livestock areas where it could be considered a threat. There is concern that toucans, macaws, or parrots that usually migrate to Ñembi Guasu may migrate to the city due to the loss of their habitat. Some species identified as victims include:"

Those responsible for enabling this forestry regulation be identified; 4. Settlements in affected areas be prohibited and their regeneration promoted, preventing changes in land use.[141] The Pan-Amazonian Ecclesial Network (REPAM),[142] expressed concern that the Amazon is at a point of no return due to human intervention combined with climate change. The Center for Legal Studies and Social Research (CEJIS),[143] which defends against threats and violations of the individual and collective rights of indigenous peasant peoples, issued a statement rejecting the central government's justifications for controlled burns, considering it a violation of the rights of Mother Earth. Representing the Chiquitano Nation, the Chiquitano Indigenous Organization (OICH)[144] expressed concern for the more than 35 directly affected communities that lost animals and production due to fires not caused by nature but by burns and deforestation, and demanded the repeal of Law 741 of 2015 and Supreme Decree 3973, dated July 10, 2019. A total of 21 organizations expressed their stance on the matter in August: Unitas, Aprosar, Casa de la Mujer, Cedla, Cenda, Cejis, CER-DET, Ciac, Cidem, Cipca, DNI-B, Fundación Aclo, Fundación Uramanta, IICCA, Indicep, Islap, Kurmi, Mujeres en Acción, Pío XII, Promotur, and Semta.[145] On September 9, Amnesty International sent a letter to Evo Morales requesting the repeal of Supreme Decree 3973. María José Veramendi Villa, a researcher at Amnesty International, stated that authorities should independently and scientifically investigate the causes of the fires rather than making contradictory and unfounded statements.[63] On September 15, the postgraduate unit in human development CIDES of the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés in La Paz issued a statement titled \"Chiquitanía in Flames,\"[146] adding voices for the government to declare a national disaster, as it impacts nature and the indigenous peoples of the lowlands. It also criticized how authorities are addressing this issue without considering strategic points for heritage conservation and food security, among others.[147] The College of Biologists of La Paz, supported by 80 institutions, issued a statement urging the government to declare the area a disaster zone to expedite international aid. They noted that since the 1980s, the territory being burned has been recognized as a site of importance for biodiversity preservation with high ecological value.[123] The National Council for the Defense of Democracy (Conade) announced the creation of a committee to promote a trial of responsibilities against President Evo Morales for violating human rights. Rolando Villena clarified that this would take place in the next legislature.[148] In Santa Cruz, the College of Agronomists of Santa Cruz (Cinacruz), the College of Veterinary Doctors of Santa Cruz (Comvetcruz), the College of Forestry Engineers of Santa Cruz (CIF-SC), the College of Biologists of Santa Cruz (Colbiocruz), and the College of Environmental Engineers of Santa Cruz (Ciam-SC), in a joint action, explained why it is necessary to declare a national disaster state: the rural area will be affected by pests and diseases, water will begin to run out, as will meat, creating problems in food security; there will be shortages of agricultural products, putting meat exports at risk; there is a risk of contagious diseases and wildlife mortality.[108] On September 24, the National Summit for the Defense of Forests was held, a meeting between activists and professionals in the field, which concluded with the creation of the Intersectoral Coordinator for the Defense of Nature and Peoples. They drafted a manifesto supporting the Indigenous March for Life and the Defense of the Forest and demanded the declaration of a national disaster to activate international aid protocols, the repeal of Law 741, Law 1098, Supreme Decree 3874, and Supreme Decree 3973, a trial of responsibilities for the President, the annulment of contracts related to the expansion of the agricultural frontier, prosecution of those responsible for the fires, the reversal of land allocations, and the registration of firefighters for health insurance, equipment provision, and training.[149]"

Angélica Sosa, President of the Honorable Municipal Council of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, was confronted, and she exchanged shouts with the protesters. On September 5, the Mujeres Creando collective in Santa Cruz threw red paint symbolizing blood and sealed off the Chamber of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (CAINCO), holding them responsible for the fires. Sarah Vásquez explained that it was necessary to repeal Decree 3973, Law 741, cancel meat export contracts to China, and annul the ethanol and biodiesel project. On September 6 in La Paz, Mujeres Creando peacefully took over the offices of the Authority for the Supervision and Social Control of Forests and Land (ABT), with María Galindo demanding the resignation of Cliver Rocha and holding him partially responsible for the disaster. Hours later, Rocha was removed from his position. On September 10, the CIDOB, in an extraordinary assembly of the Association of Indigenous Councils of San Ignacio de Velasco, called for the great tenth march of indigenous nations against the laws and decrees that destroy our great home, set to depart on September 16 towards La Paz, demanding that international and national regulations on land use and natural resource use be strictly enforced. That same day, the Extraordinary Assembly of Cruceñidad declared a national disaster in response to the National Government's refusal and called for a large assembly in defense of the land. On September 24, Bolivian residents in the United States approached the assembly to demand that Bolivia declare a national disaster."

Carlos Romero, Minister of Government, stated that legal proceedings were initiated against five people who started fires. In an interview, he claimed that individuals of Chilean nationality were behind the fire: \"We have five closed investigation cases, and there is another case that we will open immediately. There are people who allegedly caused the fires deliberately. We cannot say they are settlers or community members; we even have people of Chilean nationality involved in a case in San José de Chiquitos.\" Víctor Borda, President of the Chamber of Deputies, stated: \"We do not want to prejudge, but unfortunately, it seems that some people, activists, are using and provoking these fires for political purposes, and that is a crime; they are killing biodiversity.\" In a meeting with President Evo Morales on September 3, the National Coordinator for Change (CONALCAM), an institution aligned with the government, accused Brazilians and Mennonites of being responsible. In the same statement, they said they would go to Roboré for a demonstration in defense of Mother Earth, but days later decided not to. \"We denounce that the foreignization of land, at the hands of Mennonites and Brazilians, brought this industrial logic that today causes deforestation at the expense of life, and the attempts to blame the communities hide that more than 90 percent of the deforested lands in the country end up in the hands of businesses.\" Firefighters and volunteers reported that while they extinguish the fire, settlers come from behind to reignite it. Alcohol cans were found, and many volunteers left disappointed because even one of the community members complained to the firefighters for extinguishing the fire, saying they would reignite it later. They also mentioned feeling harassed, being watched during meetings, and being followed on motorcycles. Henry Nina, leader of the Interculturals, strongly denied the accusations and pointed to ranchers and agribusinesses. Germaín Caballero, mayor of San José de Chiquitos, stated that farmers who came from Yapacaní, San Julián, and Cuatro Cañadas are the ones causing the fires. Spanish firefighters reported that the fires are being set to exploit the land, with the intention of selling meat and soy to China, and that the authorities are not doing everything possible to extinguish the fire. It is reported that some people are taking advantage of the situation to burn land because they know the government will not impose any sanctions and that there will be a \"forgiveness\" at some point in the future, allowing them to legally claim the land they burned.

He was accused of using the same rhetoric regarding the environment, despite regulations against Mother Earth existing since 2011. Pablo Solón pointed out that his speech is devalued due to its inconsistency with his actions, as he blames developed countries for the greenhouse effect while failing to comply with the Paris Agreement. According to Leonardo Tamburini, a researcher at the Center for Legal Studies and Social Research (Cejis), the Bolivian government's development model is entirely contrary to the protection of Mother Earth's rights, adhering instead to a capitalist extractivist model. He accuses the president of creating a pro-Mother Earth slogan for external audiences, while his government program lacks concrete measures in favor of nature. Actions contradicting the president's rhetoric include: seven regulations that harm the environment, the approval of 1,400 settlements in forested areas, hydrocarbon exploration and the implementation of hydroelectric projects in protected areas, mining exploitation in forest zones, the expansion of agricultural frontiers for biofuel production, roads that destroy ecosystems, authorization of genetically modified organisms, and policies that negatively impact indigenous peoples occupying the affected territories."

The President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, defended environmental preservation within the framework of the Paris Agreement, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. However, Cecilia Requena, a senatorial candidate, explained that there are no plans for the government to fulfill the commitments of the Paris Agreement made at COP23 in Bonn, Germany, where they pledged to reduce deforestation, a commitment ratified in 2017. This commitment contradicts the Patriotic Agenda, which proposes expanding the agricultural frontier by 10 million hectares by 2025. Gonzalo Colque, president of Fundación Tierra, stated that the territory burned is a result of this initiative. Biologist Marco Octavio Rivera considered the President's discussion of the post-fire stage unfortunate and recommended that authorities contact universities, research institutes, and park rangers who have worked for decades on forest preservation instead of holding poorly technical meetings, especially with those responsible for the fires: settler unions, development corporations, cattle ranching federations, and agribusinesses."

In total, it was estimated that the fires in the province devastated 1,300,000 hectares of fields and forests. According to biologist Esteban Dussart, a professor at the Faculty of Agronomy of the National University of La Pampa with a master's degree in biological sciences from universities in Belgium, the origin and spread of the 2017 fires were due to the lack of a concrete and rational management plan for native forests, along with political disinterest in them.

Between January 24 and 30, 2018, the devastated area increased by 174,000 hectares, totaling more than 600,000 hectares burned by the end of January. Amid the severe fires, whose poor management led the National Government to transfer control of the fires from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Security, around 300,000 hectares were burned in just one month, equivalent to 15 times the area of the entire city of Buenos Aires. Following budget cuts for fire prevention, Sergio Bergman, former Minister of Environment of the Nation and former PRO deputy, was criticized by the opposition and environmental groups for a drastic reduction in the area's budget and for stating that the most useful way to face the fire season was \"to pray,\" describing the extensive fires as \"an apocalyptic prophecy\" while forest fires also spread through the provinces of Río Negro and Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, the government of La Pampa and the Agricultural Emergency Commission (CEA) declared an agricultural emergency until June 30. By January 17, it was reported that the fires had already burned 800,258 hectares, equivalent to 40 times the area of the Federal Capital. The most affected department by January 2018 was Caleu Caleu, in the southwestern province, where La Adela is located, with more than 450,000 hectares. Other affected departments were Utracán and Chalileo, each exceeding 100,000 hectares burned. In 2017, former President Mauricio Macri transferred the Fire Management Plan to the Ministry of Security led by Patricia Bullrich. Deputy María Emilia Soria requested the interpellation of Bergman for his management of the fires. The magnitude of the environmental disaster had repercussions in international media. The origin of the fires was reportedly linked to soybean agricultural sectors that habitually burn grasslands to intentionally start fires to reduce field maintenance costs. The most significant criticisms against the national government were particularly directed at Minister Sergio Bergman for the delay in responding to the fires. The first and only firefighting plane arrived on January 1, when the situation was critical. According to information published by the Ministry of Modernization, Bergman used only 51 percent of the budget allocated to the National Fire Management System in his first year in office. Due to the handling of the fires and budget under-execution, various opposition deputies called for the minister's resignation. According to official data published by the Ministry of Modernization, only 111 million out of a total of 243 million were executed. In the case of the Environmental Control program, which performs similar functions, 80 million pesos were allocated for 2017, of which only 34 million were executed, just 42.5% of the budget allocated to the Federal Fire Management System, created by law in 2012 to prevent and combat forest and rural fires. By February 2018, the fires had caused the death of two people and more than a thousand head of cattle that month. In January 2018, after his vacation and two months of active fires, Bergman visited the area when the fire was spreading to the neighboring province of Buenos Aires, prompting criticism from various sectors. The Buenos Aires provincial coordinator of the Agrarian Federation criticized the minister's attitude, stating that \"the area needs firefighting planes, not officials with their photographers.\" It was also stated that the money should be spent on firefighting planes, not on transporting national and provincial officials with their photographers to the fire-affected area in southwestern Buenos Aires, where fires began in January 2018. Weeks earlier, during a meeting on December 28 with the agricultural board, various rural representatives had warned Buenos Aires ministers about the severity of the situation in the area due to severe droughts, but officials delayed action for more than a week. Small rural producer groups requested the National Government to respond to the damages they were suffering due to the fires in Buenos Aires, which by the end of January had devastated more than 690,000 hectares. In the following months, the minister's management was questioned, and finally, Minister Sergio Bergman was criminally charged with embezzlement of public funds in various maneuvers to hire firefighting helicopters without bidding and directly. The case was assigned to federal judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, with intervention by federal prosecutor Federico Delgado. Days later, it was revealed that a portal had exposed the direct hiring of a Spanish helicopter company despite the bidding process being underway. The company did not have authorization to fly in the country and did not meet the bidding requirements."

        "content": "Modify - modify the code - modify Wikidata  \nThe 2022 forest fires in the Gironde department, France, are fires that, in distinct phases, primarily affected three different areas of the Gironde forest from mid-July to the end of September, requiring the intervention of several hundred firefighters from Aquitaine or other regions and even some European countries. The first fire began accidentally on Tuesday, July 12, around 3 p.m., in a plot of the La Teste-de-Buch forest, a locality bordering the southern part of the Arcachon Basin. A second fire was reported about an hour later, the same day near Landiras, in the south of the department. In the following weeks, it was in the south of Médoc that the forest faced the assault of the flames. Among other factors, the department had only received limited rainfall since August 2021. This rainfall deficit contributed to the drying out of forested areas, which, combined with the heatwave in Western Europe in July 2022, persistent drought, and stormy winds, significantly exposed the region to the risk of forest fires. The exceptional fires of July caused the evacuation of 36,750 residents and ravaged 20,800 hectares of forest (mainly pine) over nearly two weeks before the numerous resources deployed managed to contain them: the La Teste-de-Buch fire after 11 days, on July 23, and the Landiras fire supposedly fully under control two days later, on July 25. On August 9, as a result of the underground spread of the blaze through deep peat deposits, the fire reignited in Landiras and \"reappeared\" around Saint-Magne, causing the destruction of 7,400 additional hectares between the municipalities of Belin-Béliet, Hostens, Saint-Magne, and extending to the Landes municipalities of Moustey, Saugnac-et-Muret, and Mano, as well as the evacuation of several thousand residents. On Monday, September 12, in the south of the Landes du Médoc, a new fire broke out in the Saumos forest, then spread to part of the neighboring municipality of Sainte-Hélène, where several residents, exposed to smoke, had to be evacuated. This fire destroyed 3,720 hectares. On September 18, a fire burned at least 120 hectares of forest near Arès. In total, these fires burned more than 32,000 hectares of the Landes de Gascogne forest. With 13,800 hectares burned, not counting the fire's resurgence, the Landiras fire is the second largest in recent French history, behind the 1949 Landes forest fire."

        "content": "During the period from the end of August 2021 to May 2022, the Gironde department experienced the lowest rainfall recorded since 1959. This led the Prefecture of Gironde to impose water restrictions in the department starting in June 2022. On Sunday, July 17, weather conditions deteriorated in France, and fifteen departments along the Atlantic coast were declared on red alert (see Météo-France Weather Vigilance) due to the 2022 European heatwave with record temperatures expected for Monday, July 18. Fifty-one other departments were placed on orange alert."

        "content": "The fire in La Teste-de-Buch broke out around 3:00 PM on Tuesday, July 12. According to its mayor, Patrick Davet, the origin of the disaster was the result of a serious electrical problem that triggered a fire aboard a utility vehicle traveling on a forest track (Track 214), connecting the departmental road D218, near the Dune of Pilat, to the departmental road D112 leading from the main town of La Teste to the village of Cazaux. A second fire broke out an hour later in the commune of Landiras, between Hostens and Langon. On Tuesday evening, authorities evacuated five hamlets and the village of Guillos near Landiras as a precaution. Five hundred people were evacuated, and no casualties were reported in this fire. Roads D115 and D125 were closed to traffic. In the area near the fire, an evacuation of five campsites with approximately 6,000 vacationers began on July 13 as a precaution. They were relocated to the exhibition center and a shopping center in La Teste-de-Buch. Road D218 was cut off by the fire between Pilat and Biscarrosse beach. No injuries were reported. By the evening of July 12, the fire had consumed 445 hectares of forest in La Teste. By noon the next day, the affected area was estimated at 700 hectares. During the Landiras fire, 800 hectares had burned since Tuesday, July 12, and no injuries were reported. The prefecture then activated two operational command posts managed by the Gironde SDIS to coordinate operations. Nearly six hundred firefighters were mobilized to fight the fire, while volunteers from Civil Protection and the Red Cross carried out support missions for the population. Two Canadair water bombers were deployed, along with two Dash aircraft, with additional reinforcements from other regions of France. By noon, the fire in this area had reached 1,000 hectares."

        "content": "On the morning of July 14, the area of forest devastated by flames near Arcachon in the territory of the commune of La Teste-de-Buch was estimated at 1,750 hectares, with no injuries reported. Due to the configuration of the forest terrain, consisting of successive dunes, the fire was still not under control as it was difficult to access. Starting at 5 a.m., around sixty people were evacuated from an area north of the village of Cazaux. The D218 road leading from the Pilat roundabout to the Landes locality of Biscarrosse was closed. By early evening, the fire had ravaged 2,900 hectares and two houses, and campsites near Lake Cazaux were under threat. New evacuations took place in the afternoon around Cazaux, and 4,000 evacuees were initially housed at the La Teste-de-Buch exhibition center, which was quickly converted into a reception center. In Landiras, 2,100 hectares burned near Langon on Thursday morning without causing injuries. The fire was not under control, and the D115, D125, and D220 roads were closed to traffic. Guillos and the hamlets of Lahon, Hil, and Petit-Hil were evacuated. By evening, the fire had burned 2,400 hectares and was still not under control. Nearly a thousand firefighters, four Canadair planes, and two Dash planes were mobilized. The prefect, Fabienne Buccio, placed the Gironde department on orange alert due to weather conditions and the possible risk of other forest fires. On the morning of July 15, 3,150 hectares had burned in La Teste-de-Buch, and the fire had reached Lake Cazaux. Evacuations of some 10,000 people from the village continued. The La Teste-de-Buch fire was still not under control, and in Cazaux, three houses and two lakeside restaurants were destroyed. Bulldozers were brought to strategic locations to create firebreaks across the probable path of the fire. About a thousand firefighters, three Canadair planes, and one Dash plane were deployed to fight the fires in both areas that morning. Some individuals were allowed to return to spared sites, and vacationers evacuated since Tuesday from campsites in La Teste-de-Buch near the large dune returned on Friday, July 15, to retrieve their camping equipment and luggage. Most Cazaux residents were not allowed to return to check the condition of their homes or retrieve their pets. New evacuations were carried out throughout the day in Louchats, Origne, Balizac, and La Broque, with around 1,900 evacuees. The fire situation in this area remained out of control. A house in Guillos was destroyed, and other roads in the fire zone remained closed. Greece and Italy provided two Canadair planes to France. Upon their arrival, they were immediately deployed in the south of the country, which was also experiencing fires. President Emmanuel Macron visited the crisis center of the Ministry of the Interior in Paris to be briefed on the progress of the firefighting efforts. Gironde was one of 16 departments on orange alert due to the heatwave. On July 16, some Cazaux residents who had left their homes were only allowed 15 minutes to retrieve belongings and pets, while others were unable to return as their route was again threatened by fire. The La Teste-de-Buch fire was contained but still burning, with the potential to become uncontrollable if temperatures remained high and winds picked up again. Villagrains (a commune of Cabanac-et-Villagrains) was evacuated, as were 1,900 residents of Hostens. In the commune, an evacuation order was issued, but residents were not required to leave; those choosing to stay had to declare their decision. The amount of vegetation and forest burned in the two fires now totaled less than 10,000 hectares. Two new shelters were opened in Saucats and Belin-Béliet. Canadair and Dash planes dropped 6,000 liters and 10,000 liters of water and fire retardant, respectively, on the fire fronts and flanks, attempting to stop or at least slow its progression. So far, four firefighters had been injured, one fire engine overturned, and another was burned. Three thousand buildings had been saved. The president of the Gironde Departmental Council, Jean-Luc Gleyze, advocated for the local positioning of a fleet of Canadair and Dash planes to fight the fire, as some Canadair planes had been moved to other regions of France. Some arrived too late, making it more difficult to control the fire. According to him, if the La Teste-de-Buch fire could be contained between the coast and Lake Cazaux, more resources could then be transferred to Landiras. Jean-Marc Pelletant, mayor of Landiras, stated that a team of Bordeaux prosecutors had arrived and was investigating criminal activity responsible for the fire. The evacuation of 2,100 people from Cabanac (a commune of Cabanac-et-Villagrains) began on July 17, with more than 16,000 people evacuated since Tuesday, July 12. By midday, the prefecture announced that approximately 11,000 hectares had burned in the two fires. 1,500 firefighters from across France were fighting the fire. During the La Teste-de-Buch fire, 3,400 hectares were destroyed, compared to 7,200 hectares in the Landiras fire. The latter fire had a perimeter of 12 kilometers by 6 kilometers with several different advances. By midday, firebreak construction continued, with the La Teste-de-Buch fire being fought on its left and right flanks to protect campsites and homes. During the day at the Landiras fire, the DFCI continued to establish firebreaks. By evening, 3,900 hectares had burned in La Teste-de-Buch and 9,000 hectares in Landiras, after the fire situation worsened in the afternoon, with the former fire reaching the ocean at the Banc d'Arguin and turning south. In Landiras, the fire spread on multiple fronts as the wind shifted. Resources to fight the fire were increased but still needed to be deployed, with three additional planes, two hundred firefighters, and eleven other firefighting vehicles allocated. In the Landiras region, two new shelters were opened in Langon, while one was closed in Saucats. On Monday, July 18, 1,700 firefighters from across France and some neighboring countries were now mobilized to fight the fire. More than 16,000 people had been evacuated, with new evacuations planned in the Landiras region. About fifty victims were housed in shelters on the night of July 17-18. 4,300 hectares of forest had burned in La Teste-de-Buch, and 10,000 people had been evacuated. Since the morning, boating on the western part of Lake Cazaux-Sanguinet and navigation and anchoring in the southern entrance channel of the Arcachon Basin had been prohibited. Evacuations of the communes of Landiras, Budos, and Balizac were underway, with an estimated 3,500 people to be evacuated. On Tuesday, July 19, 6,500 hectares had burned in La Teste-de-Buch, and another 8,000 people were evacuated, bringing the total to approximately 20,000 people. An evacuation of a nursing home in the Dune du Pilat was completed overnight, and part of the La Teste-de-Buch zoo had to be evacuated to the Pessac zoo. In Landiras, 12,800 hectares had burned, and more than 8,000 people were evacuated, bringing the total evacuations to 14,000 people. The Flots Bleus campsite, which hosted the film \"Camping\" in 2006, was completely destroyed. In La Teste-de-Buch, 7,000 hectares of forest had already burned, and 20,000 people were evacuated. In Landiras, 13,300 hectares had burned, and preventive evacuations took place in Saint-Léger-de-Balson (about 300 people), Saint-Symphorien (about 2,000 people), and even Mano (about 130 additional people), the only commune in the Landes evacuated as a precaution against the possible spread of this fire. In Vensac, the fire started at 8:45 p.m. and had already burned 80 hectares; a campsite and a hamlet were evacuated, totaling 550 people."

Four Canadairs, two Dash planes, and one PUMA water-bombing helicopter from Civil Security are still mobilized, and 2,000 firefighters from Gironde and external departments have been brought in as reinforcements. Following numerous fire protection works carried out the previous day, the spread of the fires was significantly limited over the past 24 hours. For the second consecutive day, the two fires did not present any more active flame fronts and did not progress. The drop in temperatures also facilitated the firefighters' work. No additional evacuations took place on this day. A total of 36,750 people have been evacuated since the start of the fires. On July 21, the fires did not progress but were not yet under control, according to the prefecture. The first reintegrations began, with 6,000 people allowed to return to their homes. An additional 6,500 residents were able to return home on July 22, as the two fires were now contained."

This resurgence also resulted in the closure of the A63. Firefighters reported two injuries and six burned trucks. 1,000 firefighters were mobilized as of August 10. The evacuation of the town of Béliet, involving 2,500 people, was ordered. Reception centers were opened in the municipalities of Salles, Saint-Symphorien, and Le Barp. During a new assessment on August 11, 7,400 hectares of forest had burned. The area to be monitored covered a perimeter of 40 km, requiring the mobilization of 1,300 firefighters as well as 361 personnel and 101 vehicles deployed as reinforcements from Germany, Greece, Poland, Austria, and Romania. On August 12, 2022, German reinforcements were engaged in Belin-Béliet to address hot spots. On Sunday, August 14, 2022, the head of the SDIS 33 and the sub-prefect of Arcachon, Ronan Léaustic, announced from the VPC that all fires were now under control but not yet extinguished. A long-term effort would continue in the coming weeks to prevent any resurgence. On Wednesday, September 28, 2022, the prefect of Gironde announced in a press release that all fires were now extinguished after two and a half months of struggle."

On the other hand, in Landiras, the fire outbreak is suspected to be of criminal origin. An investigation for \"destruction by fire of woods, forest potentially causing harm to people\" is underway."

        "content": "If drought and exceptional heat are the triggering elements of these large fires, other causes have favored the fire, such as the cancellation of the planned clearing in 2021[67]. The event also stems from major demographic trends, shortcomings in land-use planning, and the limits of a primarily reactive risk management approach, based on a rapid and massive response to fire outbreaks[68]. Indeed, when urbanization is marked by the presence of numerous scattered neighborhoods and hamlets, it forces emergency services to manage the safety of thousands of people and compels them to disperse their resources to protect homes in a defensive logic, to the detriment of a more offensive strategy focused more on controlling the fire's progression[68]. In a forward-looking approach, integrating the issue of climate change, it would be useful to further mobilize land-use planning tools, which were scarcely utilized in 2022, such as Forest Fire Risk Prevention Plans (PPRIF) (only 13 municipalities across the entire Landes massif) to incorporate fire risk into long-term urban planning[68]."

        "content": "Sierra de la Culebra, province of Zamora, Spain  \nIn the summer of 2022, two major fires occurred in the Sierra de la Culebra, in the northwest of the Spanish province of Zamora. They particularly affected the Sierra de la Culebra and its surroundings. The first one started on June 15 between the areas of Ferreras de Arriba and Sarracín de Aliste, and the second on July 17 in the area of Losacio. The cause of both fires was a dry storm phenomenon. The first fire was controlled on June 24, 2022, and the second on August 14, 2022. The flames spread across the territories of 52 localities in the regions of Aliste, La Carballeda, Tábara, Tierra de Alba, and Benavente and the Valles. In the Ferreras fire, 29,670 hectares were affected. In the Losacio fire, the affected area reached 35,960 hectares. These are the two largest fires in the history of Castilla y León, and two of the most devastating in Spain since records began. Despite the starting points of both fires being more than 20 km apart, the affected areas came into contact along a 15 km line. The combined perimeter affected by both fires encompassed an area of nearly 66,000 hectares. Of this area, 34,000 hectares were of high ecological value as they belonged to the natural space of the Sierra de la Culebra, which is part of the Meseta Ibérica biosphere reserve. 48% of this natural space was consumed by the flames during the two fires, in a time span of just over a month."

        "content": "More than half of the forest mass of the Sierra de la Culebra consists of coniferous forests, as a result of successive reforestation efforts carried out during the 1950s and 1960s on highly eroded land. The resin or maritime pine species (Pinus pinaster) is the most abundant, followed by the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). To a lesser extent, there are discontinuous masses of native species such as the Pyrenean oak, holm oak, cork oak, and strawberry tree. The previous major wildfires that the Sierra de la Culebra had suffered date back to the 1990s. In particular, on July 20, 1990, due to a dry thunderstorm, a fire started between the areas of Ferreras de Arriba and Cabañas de Aliste, spreading through Las Torres de Aliste, Pobladura de Aliste, and Villardeciervos, and burned 5,000 hectares. The following year, on July 8, 1991, another fire destroyed 6,784 hectares in the central area of the Sierra de la Culebra, between the villages of Figueruela de Arriba, Linarejos, Santa Cruz de los Cuérragos, Flechas, and San Pedro de las Herrerías. Since then, more localized and smaller-scale forest fires have occurred. Unlike pyrophilic plants such as the Pyrenean oak or holm oak, which have some capacity to regrow after a fire, many pine species do not withstand fire. Their survival mechanism involves producing cones that burst open when exposed to fire, dispersing their seeds to regenerate in cleared, nutrient-rich soil once the fire is extinguished. Following the aforementioned fires of the 1990s, no reforestation or forest management plans were implemented in most of the affected areas, leading to a massive spontaneous reforestation of resin and Scots pine species over the next thirty years among dense shrubland. This resulted in the Sierra de la Culebra being populated by a very dense forest mass composed mainly of shrubland and pine forests, with a high potential for fire propagation."

Specifically, May 2022 was the second warmest and driest May in history. During June 2022, a heatwave occurred in Europe, which in Spain lasted from June 12 to June 18, being the second earliest heatwave ever recorded. The Aemet weather station in Villardeciervos recorded a maximum temperature of 35.8°C during the heatwave on June 15, while the minimum temperature during the night of June 17 to 18 was 17.5°C. In comparison, the average minimum temperature for the month of June at that weather station is 11°C. Under these circumstances, Aemet warned of an extreme fire risk starting June 14 across most of mainland Spain, particularly in the northwest of the province of Zamora. These meteorological episodes created very favorable conditions for the spread of the fire on June 15. During July 2022, another heatwave occurred in Spain, lasting from July 9 to July 19. Under these circumstances, the extreme fire risk persisted in the province of Zamora. The episodes of very high maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as minimal humidity levels, facilitated the rapid spread of the fire on July 17."

During the morning and afternoon of the 16th, resources and personnel from the Military Emergency Unit, the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, the Community of Madrid, and Galicia joined the firefighting efforts. The arrival of east winds with gusts of up to 40 km/h and high temperatures of nearly 40°C made extinguishing the fires difficult. By 5:30 PM, the estimated burned area was 900 hectares, of which 738 corresponded to the Ferreras de Arriba fire, 127 to the Sarracín de Aliste fire, and 28 to the Ferreras de Abajo fire. Throughout the day, a bulldozer operator was injured after suffering burns to his hands during firefighting tasks.

        "content": "The strong shifting winds early in the night, with gusts of up to 54 km/h, the high nighttime temperatures, and the rugged terrain with steep slopes and high rockiness complicated the firefighting efforts during the night. All of this, combined with the inability to use aerial resources, resulted in the fire advancing nearly 15 km in a straight line overnight and forced the evacuation of the municipalities of Cabañas de Aliste, Palazuelo de las Cuevas, Las Torres de Aliste, Pobladura de Aliste, Mahíde, San Pedro de las Herrerías, and Flechas. The high severity of the burned areas during the night in the mountain ranges of Ferreras de Arriba, Cabañas de Aliste, and Las Torres de Aliste, as well as the records of fire spread and wind direction and speed, indicate that a very intense explosive phenomenon of firestorm was generated in the early hours of the morning, where the fire created its own wind currents through a strong convective column. Unlike other areas of the fire, this sector experienced the total incineration of the existing forest mass. More than 220 people worked overnight on firefighting efforts. On the morning of the 17th, the first estimates from the emergency operation indicated an approximate burned area of 7,000 hectares, although other estimates already suggested figures of 14,000 hectares. The southerly wind forced the evacuation of the towns of Boya and Villardeciervos. During the afternoon of the 17th, weather conditions worsened, with constant southerly winds of 30 km/h, erratic behavior, and gusts of up to 70 km/h, leading to very high propagation speeds that rendered firebreak attempts and technical fire efforts ineffective. At 7:00 PM, the Villardeciervos base was evacuated. Additionally, during the afternoon of the 17th, the towns of Villanueva de Valrojo, Sagallos, Codesal, and Cional were evacuated. More than 400 people were working on extinguishing the fire, including 92 resources, 23 of which were aerial. In the afternoon of the 17th, the Ferreras de Abajo hotspot got out of control, forcing the evacuation of the municipalities of Ferreras de Abajo and Ferreras de Arriba, as well as the closure of the N-631 road."

Evacuated residents from Boya, San Pedro de las Herrerías, Cabañas de Aliste, Mahíde, Pobladura de Aliste, Las Torres de Aliste, and Palazuelo de las Cuevas were able to return to their homes on the morning of the 18th due to the absence of nearby flames. Villardeciervos, Villanueva del Valrojo, Ferreras de Arriba, Ferreras de Abajo, Codesal, Cional, Flechas, and Otero de Bodas remained evacuated. During the afternoon of the 18th, the fire forced the closure of the Orense-Zamora high-speed rail line. Winds of nearly 40 km/h, with strong gusts of 50 to 70 km/h, pushed the flames northward, and estimates indicated an approximate area of over 25,000 hectares burned. Around 4:00 p.m., the fire crossed the N-631 near Val de Santa María. The wind gusts were so intense that the fire spread through embers over distances of up to 500 meters. By 9:00 p.m., the fire had crossed the Agavanzal reservoir. More than 500 professionals and 110 resources from the forest fire-fighting operation of the Junta de Castilla y León (INFOCAL), the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO), the UME, and the communities of Galicia, Extremadura, Cantabria, Madrid, and Castilla-La Mancha continued working to contain the flames.

Before 21:00, San Martín de Tábara, Ferreruela, and Sesnández de Tábara were evacuated. The fire had reached such magnitude that it generated its own wind system with characteristics of a firestorm, causing it to spread with great intensity and making it beyond extinction capacity. The Junta of Castilla y León requested support from the Military Emergency Unit. In this context, during the last hour of the evening, a forest firefighter died after being surrounded by flames due to their rapid advance. Additionally, 9 forest firefighters were injured to varying degrees from burns and smoke inhalation. Two other people were seriously injured in an accident related to the fire situation.

The area affected by a significant degree of burning would be 25,216.6 ha. However, from the time the Sentinel-2 data was obtained until the fire was extinguished, reproductions of the fire continued to occur in initially unburned vegetation islands, so the final area affected by the fire was greater than that provided by Sentinel-2. Of the affected land, about 21,000 hectares belonged to the natural area of the Sierra de la Culebra. In the case of the Losacio fire, initial estimates indicated an affected area of between 32,000 and 34,000 ha. According to data provided by Sentinel-2 on August 4, 2022, within the Copernicus Program, the affected area is 31,473.1 ha, with a perimeter encompassing 35,960 ha.

This meant that, until June 27, the firefighting operations available in that autonomous community did not reach 25% of those planned for the high-risk wildfire season. The vice president of the Junta, Juan García-Gallardo from the Vox party, promised aid measures on social media, including the donation of jerseys by the Vuelta Ciclista a Castilla y León and the organization of a solidarity concert in the fall to raise funds. That jersey raffle only raised 250 euros, while the so-called \"benefit concert\" was not held within the planned timeframe. Additionally, the initial benefit concert was replaced in March 2023 with the announcement of a concert to be held on June 3 as a \"tribute to those affected.\" The event entailed a cost of 160,000 euros instead of raising funds to mitigate the wildfire damages, as initially announced. \"Solidarity is that residents can attend this concert for free,\" stated García-Gallardo. Following the controversy generated, some groups withdrew from the concert days later. Finally, after the withdrawal of the headlining group Fangoria—who claimed to have been announced \"without their knowledge or consent\"—the Department of Culture, Tourism, and Sports decided to cancel the concert, which has been described by local press as \"the story of a fiasco.\""

Temperatures dropped below −10°C; −16°C was recorded in Strasbourg, −18°C in Nancy, and even −30°C in Wissembourg. At the end of January and the beginning of February, a second cold wave affected the entire country. Major rivers froze, and in Dunkirk, an ice sheet formed. Temperatures reached as low as −25°C in Luxeuil-les-Bains, −21°C in Mulhouse, and −13°C in Paris. On February 5th and 6th, a snowstorm struck Languedoc-Roussillon in the extreme south of France; in two days, 85 cm of snow fell in Perpignan, 40 cm in Carcassonne, and 30 cm in Montpellier. The extreme severity of the temperatures led Abbé Pierre to make his famous radio appeal, known as the 1954 call. This appeal triggered a massive influx of donations and introduced the French to the Emmaus Movement, created in 1949, which was then in full development."

In Quebec, wind chill reached -40 degrees Celsius on Friday, then turned into a snowstorm on Saturday and freezing rain on Sunday. Finally, the temperature dropped back to around -20°C on Monday, while the December average is -6.3°C. \"The weather is yo-yoing, and it's simply a transition as winter tries to take hold,\" said meteorologist Dave Phillips on CBC. An extreme cold alert was also issued in Toronto. \"Hypothermia occurs when body temperature falls below 35°C and has serious consequences such as organ failure and death. Frostbite can also occur in cold weather when the skin freezes, and in the most severe cases, amputation is necessary when deeper tissues are affected,\" said the city in a statement. In the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, temperatures range between -21 and -27°C according to Environment Canada."

The tidal wave in the Netherlands in 1014 refers to a significant tidal wave named (Stormvloed in Dutch) that occurred on September 28 and 29, 1014, in the Netherlands. It was probably the first breakthrough of the sea through the almost closed coastline of the lowlands in the southern Netherlands. The previous major disaster was the great flood of December 21, 838. The storm of 1014 first hit the English coastline and then continental Europe, pushing the North Sea over the dikes of present-day Zeeland, which was part of Frisia and Flanders. According to sources from that time, the Netherlands, and particularly the former island of Walcheren, suffered heavy damage. Restoration likely took an unusually long time. The chronicle of the Quedlinburg Abbey in Saxony reports that there were thousands of deaths."

Almost the entire La Muela mountain range, the entire Cerezo mountain range, and the mountains located between it and the sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza in Calasparra, on the banks of the Segura River, were mainly burned, with the Hondares mountain range being spared. Investigations pointed to an electrical failure caused by the contact of a pine tree with the power lines, producing a spark, as maintenance work had been carried out on the area's wiring in previous days. The first signs of fire were calls from Moratalla residents around 10:30 in the morning on July 4, alerting about smoke coming from the mountain range. At its peak, the fire reached several fronts in Moratalla, Benizar, Camping La Puerta (which was evacuated), Calasparra, the Sotos and Bosque de la ribera de Cañaverosa natural reserve, and Cieza, covering a total of 90 km. Among other reasons, because it did not reach large population centers, there were no fatalities. It is currently considered the worst fire recorded in the Region of Murcia and one of the most significant in Spain."

This site on the right bank of the Segura River was not affected in its garden area or the sanctuary itself, but it was on the left bank of the river and throughout the surrounding area, with very old specimens of hackberry (Celtis australis) on the right bank also burning but regrowing. The entire riparian forest area around the sanctuary is, twenty years later, in a state of conservation even better than in 1994 due to the intervention with the planting of native species on the right bank of the river."

The fire was very difficult to control, partly due to the challenges firefighters faced in accessing the heart of the park. More than 500 firefighters and twelve helicopters were needed to bring the fire under control. The fire was declared extinguished after a week. The toll was 450 hectares burned, including pines over 400 years old. Nine months later, the park was reopened to the public.

Woolly and Bohemian geraniums were observed shortly after the fire, before wind-pollinated species, such as Scots pine and fireweed, took over. Although it was harmful to certain species, such as the capercaillie, others benefited from the fire, such as Melanophila acuminata. Furthermore, a few new species were discovered following the fire, such as Tritozyga tyrestaenensis. The fire, having destroyed the thick layer of peat covering the ground, also provided an excellent opportunity for archaeologists to explore the region. In 2000, an archaeological study succeeded in identifying more than 120 sites, most of which date back to the Stone Age. Quartz fragments, probably used for making weapons and tools, were particularly found."

The importance of coordination among the organizations of the National System for Disaster Prevention and Response (SINAPRED) to address the situation was emphasized. On February 8, the Chilean Meteorological Directorate issued a yellow alert for intense heat for several communes in the Coquimbo Region, including La Higuera, Vicuña, Paihuano, Río Hurtado, Monte Patria, Combarbalá, Illapel, and Salamanca. Maximum temperatures were forecasted to reach up to 36°C, increasing the risk of forest fires. Authorities urged the population to take precautionary measures and avoid activities that could generate sparks or fire in vegetated areas. The following day, the national director of the National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response (SENAPRED), Alicia Cebrián, reported that 15 forest fires were being fought nationwide, mainly concentrated in the La Araucanía Region. Although the Coquimbo Region did not have active fires at that time, the alert for high temperatures and the call for prevention remained in place."

He also expressed concern about a fire in the Punta de Parra area, in the commune of Tomé. The following day, SENAPRED declared a Red Alert for the Biobío Region due to the simultaneous occurrence of forest fires that directly threaten populated areas and pose a risk to people's lives. This decision was made after the emergence of new fire outbreaks in different parts of the commune of Mulchén. The regional presidential delegate, Eduardo Pacheco, reported that the fires are concentrated in three points of the region: Punta de Parra (commune of Tomé), Chumulco (commune of Mulchén), and La Greda (commune of Penco). It was noted that, so far, no people or homes have been directly affected by the forest fires. On February 14, two fire outbreaks in the forests of the hills of Lebu, the capital of the Arauco province, forced the evacuation of residents in that sector of the commune with sound alerts and notifications to cell phones. On the same day, a red alert was declared for the commune of Los Álamos due to a forest fire in the Araucana Tres Pinos sector that was dangerously approaching populated areas and had consumed 33 hectares of forest.

The Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 4:15 pm on April 30. Leo continued to approach Hong Kong over the next two days. On May 2, winds strengthened on Waglan Island, reaching gale force before noon. In the afternoon of May 2, Leo's low-level circulation center continued to be steered by low-level easterly winds, moving northwest-northward towards Hong Kong. However, its deep convection was sheared off by upper-level westerlies, weakening it into a tropical storm. As the Observatory predicted that Leo would maintain tropical storm intensity within 100 kilometers of Hong Kong, the No. 8 Northeast Gale or Storm Signal was issued at 1:30 pm that afternoon. This was the earliest issuance of a No. 8 Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal since 1946. Waglan Island recorded an hourly average wind speed of 90 kilometers per hour and a maximum gust of 130 kilometers per hour between 12 pm and 1 pm on May 2. Leo then passed about 45 kilometers southeast of the Hong Kong Observatory at 5 pm. However, Leo later turned northeast and moved inland, away from Hong Kong, and winds in Hong Kong subsided. During this period, three weather stations in Hong Kong recorded gale-force winds, while three other rural weather stations recorded strong winds. As Leo weakened into a tropical depression while passing east of Hong Kong, the Observatory replaced the signal with the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 5:30 pm. By 8:45 pm, Leo had moved further away from Hong Kong and made landfall near Daya Bay, with all signals being canceled.\n\nUnder Leo's influence, there were six reports of fallen trees in Hong Kong. Three men were rescued after being in distress at sea, and a woman sustained minor injuries after slipping in Chai Wan. Slippery roads also caused 13 injuries in three traffic accidents. Most ferry services were temporarily suspended during Leo's impact. Two flights to Hong Kong and Bangkok were canceled. Shark prevention nets at five beaches on Hong Kong Island were severely damaged by large waves. Additionally, a cargo ship sank about 275 kilometers southeast of Waglan Island on April 30 due to rough seas. One crew member died, 13 went missing, and seven others were rescued from the rough waves.\n\nMany citizens were dissatisfied with the Observatory's actions, as Leo quickly weakened into a tropical depression and changed direction shortly after the No. 8 Signal was issued, which was only in effect for four hours, causing public confusion. Due to terrain shielding and the rapid collapse of Leo's wind structure, winds in Hong Kong were relatively weak, leading some citizens to question whether the No. 8 Signal was necessary. Some believed the Observatory should have observed the weather conditions in Hong Kong from noon to dusk on May 2 before deciding whether to issue the No. 8 Signal, rather than hastily issuing it when a tropical storm entered within 100 kilometers of Hong Kong, causing public confusion. In this situation, the issuance of the No. 8 Signal led citizens to mistakenly believe that winds were generally weak during such signals, prompting them to go out, and some even chased the storm along the coast. Others believed that the Observatory's prediction that Leo would enter within 100 kilometers of Hong Kong as a tropical storm justified the issuance of the No. 8 Signal.\n\nThe Observatory later explained that all relevant factors are considered when deciding whether to issue higher signals, but public safety is the primary concern. Waglan Island recorded an hourly average wind speed of 90 kilometers per hour between 12 pm and 1 pm on May 2. The Hong Kong Underground Observatory pointed out that this indicated gale-force winds had affected southern offshore areas and showed signs of possibly extending to more areas. It was not feasible for the Observatory to wait several more hours to decide whether to issue the No. 8 Signal, and from the perspective of ensuring public safety, the issuance of the No. 8 Signal was necessary."

Although no official timeframe was set for this typhoon season, most tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific typically form between May and December.  \n\nThis article is limited to the waters of the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2000 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Western Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency's Typhoon Center, with international identification numbers starting with 00xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in the region identification numbers ending with the letter W.  \n\nFor tropical depressions that enter or form within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns them a Philippine name for local warning purposes. Additionally, since China, Hong Kong, and Macau use the same translation for storm names, while Taiwan's translations may differ, the same storm may have two different Chinese names. Starting from the 2020s, Taiwan and China-Hong Kong-Macau have collaborated to confirm the Chinese names of storms. Sometimes, there may also be two different English names (the international name and the Philippine name).  \n\nThe information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its strongest form during its existence."

Storms that form in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line are called hurricanes and are included in the 2019 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical storms that form in the Northwest Pacific are named by the Japan Meteorological Agency (i.e., international names) and are assigned international numbers starting with 19xx, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigns tropical depressions in this region a number ending with the letter W. Any tropical depression that enters or forms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility is given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration for local warning purposes, which may result in two different English names (the international name is considered official). Additionally, the Chinese translations used in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan may differ. The information on each tropical cyclone below is based on its peak state during its existence. For more information on typhoons in the Western Pacific, please refer to the Pacific typhoon season."

        "content": "At the end of 2018, a tropical depression developed in the southern South China Sea, which intensified into a tropical storm named Pabuk on New Year's Day 2019, becoming the earliest recorded tropical cyclone in the Northwest Pacific to strengthen into a tropical storm. In the following days, Pabuk moved westward into the Gulf of Thailand, crossing the 100°E longitude and leaving the Japan Meteorological Agency's area of responsibility. Meanwhile, a tropical disturbance formed east of the Gilbert Islands, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center indicated that the system intensified into a tropical depression on January 4, with expectations of further strengthening. However, the system failed to intensify further, and its low-level circulation center became difficult to identify, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to issue its final advisory. The remnants of the system generally moved westward, re-intensifying into a tropical depression east of the Philippines in mid to late January, before dissipating under the combined effects of vertical wind shear and cold air. In mid to late February, Wutip formed, moved westward, and steadily intensified, becoming the season's first typhoon on February 21. By the evening of February 23, it moved northwestward and rapidly intensified into a super typhoon. Wutip weakened on February 24 but re-intensified on the 25th, becoming the strongest February typhoon on record, reaching Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Wutip gradually weakened and dissipated starting February 26. On March 14, a tropical depression formed near the Marshall Islands, weakened into a low-pressure area after making landfall in Mindanao, Philippines, and no tropical cyclones formed in April. In May, three tropical depressions formed but did not develop into tropical storms. In June, four tropical cyclones formed, one of which was upgraded to Tropical Storm Sepat on the 27th, with two systems absorbed by Sepat, which later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the 28th, while Tropical Depression 04W moved near Taiwan. The first half of 2019 saw generally quiet tropical cyclone activity, with only three cyclones reaching tropical storm strength or higher. Entering July, typhoon formation became active. A total of five tropical cyclones formed in July: Mun, Danas, one tropical depression, Nari, and Wipha. On the afternoon of July 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded a low-pressure area in the South China Sea to a tropical depression and issued a gale warning. By the evening of the next day, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named \"Mun.\" At 12:45 a.m. on July 3, China's National Meteorological Center announced that Mun made landfall in Hele Town, Wanning City, Hainan Province. At 9 a.m. on July 14, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded a low-pressure area east of the Philippines to a tropical depression. On the afternoon of July 16, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named \"Danas.\" As Danas passed through Luzon, its circulation was affected by Luzon's terrain, splitting into two, with its low-level circulation center continuing to move northward while deep convection moved into the South China Sea. During the day, Danas slowly moved northward, merging with the tropical disturbance 90W to the east in the evening, successfully repairing its exposed circulation center. On July 18, Danas continued to move steadily northward, making landfall in Buan County, North Jeolla Province, on July 20. At 9 p.m. on the 21st, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported that Danas had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. On July 24, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported the formation of a tropical depression in the Northwest Pacific south of Japan. Shortly after, a gale warning was issued, and two days later, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named \"Nari.\" At 7 a.m. on July 27, Nari made landfall in southern Mie Prefecture, Japan. At 9 a.m. on July 30, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded a low-pressure area in the central South China Sea to a tropical depression. The following morning, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named \"Wipha.\" At 1:50 a.m. on August 1, Wipha made landfall in Wenchang City, Hainan Province, and at 5:40 p.m., it made a second landfall in Potou District, Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province. Wipha prompted the issuance of tropical cyclone warning signal No. 8 in both Hong Kong and Macau."

Affected by vertical wind shear, the system developed slowly and had a loose structure. The low-level circulation center of the system gradually consolidated on the 13th, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rated its chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within one day as \"medium,\" skipping the \"low\" rating. On the afternoon of the 14th, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also raised the rating to \"high\" and issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. Due to the system's convective outbreak, showing the characteristics of a tropical cyclone, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center successively classified the system as a tropical depression at 2 a.m. and 8 a.m. on the 15th, assigning it tropical cyclone numbers 04 and 03W, respectively. That day, the system turned southwestward. Due to persistent vertical wind shear and weak outflow above the system, the tropical depression did not intensify further on the 16th. The Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan downgraded the system to a low-pressure area at 8 a.m. on the 17th. Subsequently, the system crossed Koror Island, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 2 p.m. on the 18th. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration announced that the system made landfall in Malitbog, Mindanao, Philippines, at 5:30 a.m. on the 19th. Affected by terrain, the system's central convection weakened, and the Japan Meteorological Agency downgraded it to a low-pressure area at 2 p.m. At this time, the system resumed a northwest-northward path, entering Moro Bay. In the evening, the system entered the Sulu Sea, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center stated that the system weakened and dissipated during the day on the 20th.  \n\nAs the system intensified into a tropical depression, the U.S. National Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for Ngulu Atoll, Yap Island, and Kayangel Island at 11:40 a.m. on the 15th. The U.S. National Weather Service stated that the aforementioned islands were experiencing northeast winds of 4-5 levels, with stronger circulation on the northern side of the system, making Yap Island more affected than Ngulu Atoll and Kayangel Island. The U.S. National Weather Service later expanded the tropical storm watch to include Koror Island at 5:20 a.m. on the 16th. Yap Island first experienced east winds in the morning, and Ngulu Atoll and Kayangel Island experienced east winds by the early morning of the 17th.

The press of the time reported that tramway traffic had to be interrupted at Quai Saint-Bernard due to tree trunks fallen on the roadway. Roofs were torn off in various places, such as Place d'Italie. The Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes were also affected. The event caused two deaths: an eleven-year-old girl killed in the collapse of a laundry at 85 Rue de Patay in the 13th arrondissement, and a young woman in her twenties who fell from the top of the fortifications at Porte d'Ivry."

Likely categorized as F2 on the Fujita scale, it causes the death of at least five people and injures about a hundred others. The phenomenon, which moves almost in a straight line northward, spans a strip 150 to 300 meters wide and 6 kilometers long through the 6th, 1st, 3rd, and 10th arrondissements, affecting notably: Place Saint-Sulpice, Quai des Grands-Augustins, where trees are uprooted and booksellers' boxes scattered; the Seine, where several barges sink or are damaged; Pont Saint-Michel, Île de la Cité, Pont au Change; Place du Châtelet, where the theater's roof is partially torn off; Rue Réaumur, where the damage is most striking, Rue de Turbigo; Place de la République, Boulevard Saint-Martin, Boulevard de Magenta, then Canal Saint-Martin, where a woman and her child are thrown into the water; Hôpital Saint-Louis and Boulevard de la Villette, where a funfair is devastated. The press reports that, according to witnesses, the whirlwind does not rise higher than the treetops and notably leaves the top of the Saint-Jacques Tower intact. It also moves in the manner of a \"rubber ball, by successive leaps.\" Among the victims are: an English jockey, Alfred Eyears, who was in an open carriage and was, according to sources, either thrown \"ten meters high\" or more soberly \"crushed by the fall of a chimney\" at Quai des Orfèvres; a laborer, Mr. Vanderhagle, killed by a lead sheet torn from a roof; a five-year-old child, Antoine Rouché, killed by a tree branch; a porter at Les Halles, suffering from a heart condition, who died the next day while recounting his accident; the wife of a bargeman, Mrs. Lefebvre, struck by a tree branch on her sinking barge.

These storms impacted Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, San Luis, Catamarca, Córdoba, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires. When the first damages were reported in the initial provinces, the people of Córdoba were almost caught off guard by the alert. The winds caused damage in other cities, such as fallen trees, power and light poles, and cars dented by hail that some said was the size of a tennis ball. The Meteorological Service extended the alert from four to seven days because it seemed to be gaining strength, and that’s when the inhabitants of La Docta began to worry."

The oppressive heat was countered by gray and black clouds that began appearing from the mountains early in the morning, while news reports mentioned strong river surges in the mountainous areas and damage in towns like Villa Dolores, where hail and wind caused further destruction. In the capital, the occasional sound of fireworks explosions and remnants of the previous night's Christmas celebrations could still be heard. By 2:00 PM, some residents were preparing to take a nap with the drizzle that had started to fall. Then tragedy struck. At 3:15 PM, a funnel-shaped cloud began descending toward the ground. Many witnesses were stunned by the event until they started seeking shelter upon seeing houses, trees, cables, and other objects being lifted into the air. Sheets of metal from warehouses violently wrapped around trees that the winds could not uproot. The tornado moved forward with gusts exceeding 300 km/h, heavy rain, hail, and lightning. Some residents in the city center watched the phenomenon in amazement from tall buildings, while the tornado caused destruction in the area of the CPC on Route 20, particularly in the neighborhoods of Ameguino Norte, San Roque, and Villa La Tela, where most of the deaths, injuries, and damage occurred."

Surprised by the phenomenon, a strong rescue operation was organized for those affected by the tornado. Upon arrival at the scene, they encountered a desolate landscape: people mourning their material losses; furniture, beds, sheets, roofs scattered everywhere; fallen poles and cables; uprooted trees; etc. The tornado, which lasted 24 minutes, devastated two neighborhoods and an emergency settlement, and the winds caused damage in forty more neighborhoods, with intensity increasing as it approached the area where the funnel began. Unfortunately, five lives were lost, more than 90 people were injured, and about 5,000 were evacuated. The Police could not prevent unknown individuals from stealing belongings left outdoors after the storm. In other nearby towns like Villa Carlos Paz or La Calera, less intense damage was reported. The strong and sudden rise of rivers filled lakes and reservoirs to their limits, prompting the National Government and DIPAS to order the opening of floodgates, causing post-dam rivers to rise sharply as well. The tornado was classified as F3: that is, winds of 290 to 320 km per hour."

It is, without a doubt, the most destructive tornado in the last 100 years in Chile, surpassing the one in Villarrica in 2011 and the one in Concepción in 1934. The power outage lasted several days due to the fall of at least 400 power poles, potable water was restored on May 22, and classes were suspended for 2 weeks. A total of 2 deaths, 1 missing person, 323 injured, and 1,524 affected individuals were estimated. About 480 homes were severely affected."

The tornado occurred around 11:20 a.m. outside the San Carlos Municipal Cemetery, where it destroyed some flower shops, moved eastward along Navotavo Street, a busy area in the city, destroying and damaging houses in its path, and disappeared about 500 meters further up, where it destroyed a large part of a hardware store. It originated from the appearance of a cloud called \"Cumulonimbus,\" which forms after a frontal system, such as the one that affected Chile during those days. The cloud, in turn, was caused by a sudden temperature change, explained by the warming of the ground and the cold air, which creates atmospheric pressure between the ground and the air; this produces a downdraft from the cloud to the ground, which spins at speeds between 200 to 250 kilometers per hour (the San Carlos tornado reached 228 km/h) and moves randomly with a force capable of destroying everything in its path. It is worth noting that the phenomenon remains active as long as the temperature difference between the ground and the air is significant, usually lasting no more than 20 minutes (the San Carlos tornado lasted 12) before disappearing."

At the time of the tornado, the \"Violeta Parra Sandoval High School\" was in the middle of classes, with about 600 students and staff inside, who, according to local news reports, \"took cover under the tables while the windows shattered and the roof was blown off.\" This caused chaos among parents in the area who, in addition to the confusion caused by this unusual event, were withdrawing their children amidst the chaos, with one person injured. Other schools and high schools in the city were also forced to release students due to the collective panic in the city. Regarding damages, the Violeta Parra High School was left with some classrooms without roofs and broken windows, classes were suspended for one week, a wall on Navotavo Street collapsed, blocking part of the road, city collective transit was halted, and a power outage affected Cachapoal, Ninquihue, and San Fabián de Alico. Additionally, two community centers and about five flower shops located outside the Municipal Cemetery were affected. However, the symbol of the disaster was the \"Almet Hardware Store,\" which was severely destroyed and became the media figure of the tornado. In terms of personal injuries, no fatalities were reported, but there were two injuries: one inspector from Violeta Parra High School who was struck by a zinc sheet from the school's roof, and one pedestrian on Navotavo Street who was injured by the collapse of a wall. In the end, 103 homes were affected to varying degrees, 47 of them uninhabitable, with a total of 412 people affected and 232 displaced."

The French Observatory of Tornadoes and Severe Storms (Keraunos) classifies it as an EF2 intensity tornado[1], on the Enhanced Fujita scale. It caused significant damage in its path, such as partially destroyed homes. It is part of a tornado outbreak (clustered tornado episode) that totaled 3 cases for the day of September 16, 2015, including the EF1 tornado in Courtenay (Loiret) and the EF1 tornado in Jandun (Ardennes)[1]. This tornado is said to have traveled more than 70 km, making it the second-longest distance traveled by a tornado in France, after the EF4 tornado in Saint-Claude on August 19, 1890[3],[4]. It formed at 4:10 PM in the municipality of Chaniers, crossed the municipalities of La Chapelle-des-Pots, Saint-Césaire, Saint-Bris-des-Bois, Villars-les-Bois, Migron, Mons, Prignac, Thors, Matha, Sonnac, Haimps, Massac, Beauvais-sur-Matha, Bazauges, Ranville-Breuillaud, Barbezières, Lupsault, Saint-Fraigne, Ébréon, Souvigné, Courcôme, Raix, La Faye before dissipating in Condac around 5:05 PM.

        "content": "The day of Wednesday, September 16, 2015, saw the placement of a depression trough of 985 hPa over the Bay of Biscay, inducing a strong southwesterly flow ahead of this depression. This barometric trough was located south of a large upper-level trough, which had also absorbed the former tropical storm Henri. At altitude, a fairly strong southwesterly jet stream had formed, bringing tropical and humid air. Already during the night of September 15 to 16, a succession of sometimes strong thunderstorms had formed near the Atlantic coasts, with instability becoming increasingly pronounced. These storms were quite windy with brief but strong gusts of wind. In the morning, the storms decreased slightly in intensity, but the instability was still present. The sky in La Rochelle, at dawn, was pre-stormy, with some breaks of blue sky to the west and distant lightning to the east. At 1 p.m., a few hours before the tornado formed, a new storm passed through Charente-Maritime. The electrical activity was relatively weak. In Bordeaux, Gironde, the radiosonde indicated moderate instability, with a convective available potential energy (CAPE) of 1,006 J/kg, as well as a lifting index (LI) of -5 K, which is quite significant. The jet stream was expected to reach 250 km/h. The relative helicity was measured at 535 m²/s² in the first three kilometers of altitude, and 208 m²/s² in the first kilometer, indicating a tornado risk. The temperatures at 2 meters were high in Bordeaux (27°C) but contrasted with those recorded in Blaye (18°C), for example. This strong thermal contrast is explained by the presence of a very active cold front between the two cities. The above radiosonde indicates the atmospheric conditions in Bordeaux at 2 p.m., just before the passage of the cold front. The radiosonde explains why a tornado had formed just south of the squall line. An additional warming of 1 or 2 K due to sunlight would have caused the lifting index (LI) to drop from -5 K to -7 K, which significantly increased the severity of the storms, even though the level of free convection varied little and the cumulonimbus clouds remained modest in thickness. The above radiosonde indicates that the top of the cumulonimbus was at about 300 hPa, or 9,000 m. The cumulonimbus was therefore not very thick. The photograph from the Keraunos site confirms this fact, showing that the cumulonimbus was not very spectacular."

Quite active, this storm was quickly organizing into a retrograde-propagating linear system. At 3:00 PM, the storm reached the Charente coastline, initially between Rochefort and La Tremblade. Still fairly well-organized, producing gusts locally reaching 70 km/h. However, electrical activity remained low. The line was moving along a southwest/northeast axis, still in retrograde propagation. The northern part of the storm line tended to weaken, while the southern part retained its wind potential. No rotation was yet observed. At 3:30 PM, the line weakened in the north, where the rain became stratiform. Convective energy persisted in the southern part of the line, where unstable cells were developing and moving along the squall, heading northeast. These rare storms were most often embedded in the rainy mass. At 3:45 PM, a new cell developed at the extreme south of the line, near Royan. This particular cell would become tornadic several minutes later. At 4:00 PM, this same storm became quite active, with hail potential. This cell began to exhibit a low-top supercellular behavior (in English, Low Top or mini-supercell). A wall cloud quickly formed at the base of this mini-supercell. A shelf cloud was also visible ahead of the storm line. At 4:10 PM, a funnel cloud, or tuba, formed at the base of the wall cloud, followed by some debris starting to swirl. The tornado had thus formed, gaining intensity. On precipitation radars, the rotation was clearly visible above Chaniers. At 4:45 PM, the tornado reached its maximum intensity as it traveled through the commune of Sonnac and its surroundings. It was in this area that it caused the most damage. At 5:10 PM, the tornado finally dissipated, as did the storm cell, which became just a weakening rain line over the following minutes."

In the woods belonging to Deputy Charles Levavasseur, two to three hundred beeches were uprooted. The three mills in the valley, which concentrated most of the industrial activity, ceased to exist. The human toll is the heaviest ever recorded in France for a tornado. Among the 200 to 370 mill workers who were at work at the time, very few were able to take shelter, especially since, due to its large diameter, the funnel encompassed most of the valley. Dozens of bodies and injured people, sometimes horribly mutilated, were extracted from the debris by nearby residents who came to help. The interior of the factories is described as \"a slaughterhouse of human flesh,\" according to the newspaper La Presse. Mr. Neveu himself was pulled alive from the rubble but was very shocked. He had protected his mother with his body, and she emerged unscathed. After three hours of prostration, he declared: \"I know I am ruined, but I do not complain; I had the happiness of saving my mother.\" An ambulance service was set up, and doctors arrived from Rouen. The director of the Cheval-Noir, a local hotel, made his establishment, linens, and furniture available to them. The priest of Montville and other clergymen attended to the injured, offering prayers and comfort. The families of the victims were sent away to allow the doctors to work under the best conditions, which led to scenes of despair. As the mutilated bodies of two young girls were removed from Picquot's house, their mother recognized them and, in her grief, threw herself into the river, where she drowned. The clearing work lasted until the next day. In total, 75 deaths were counted after the disaster. On August 21, Prefect Henri Dupont-Delporte and the field marshal visited the injured and assessed the damage. A subscription for the benefit of the victims and their families was opened at the Rouen town hall, and Mayor Henry Barbet posted an appeal for donations throughout the city. Charity performances were held: in Rouen itself on September 9 and in Paris, at the Circus, on the same day, then at the Théâtre des Variétés, which was packed on September 12. The Norman writer Eugène Noël witnessed the disaster and participated in the rescue efforts with Charles Michelet (the son of historian Jules Michelet), who was among the survivors.

The most violent winds devastated a strip about 150 km wide along a curve starting from the tip of Brittany, passing through Normandy, Île-de-France, Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine, and Alsace. Lothar continued its path toward Germany, causing significant damage to infrastructure and forests such as the Black Forest. It caused unprecedented damage to forests in France, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark. Mountain winds reached speeds of 259 km/h. The depression formed off the coast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean in less than twenty-four hours. Exceptionally in Europe, the deepening of this storm intensified over land, reaching an atmospheric pressure of 960 hPa (960 mb), likely due to strong interaction with jet streams whose speed was around 400 km/h at just 9,000 meters altitude. According to a subsequent study by the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), the Austrian meteorological service, Lothar was followed by a secondary cyclogenesis trough that passed through Belgium and southwestern Germany, generating winds of over 90 km/h."

It developed off the coast of Brittany on December 27, reaching the region's coast around 4 p.m., before moving towards Nantes (7 p.m.), Romorantin (10 p.m.), Dijon (1 a.m. on December 28), and Alsace (4 a.m.). The regions most severely affected by the wind were Brittany, the Atlantic coast, particularly Charente-Maritime and Charente (198 km/h on Île d'Oléron), and then all areas south of a La Rochelle - Mâcon line, including the Côte d'Azur (gusts of 160 km/h unofficially recorded in Cannes). The wind continued to blow in Corsica on the morning of Tuesday, December 28, causing strong waves on the western coast. The storm also affected Spain, western Switzerland, and northern Italy. North of the depression, a cold air injection caused snowfall sticking to the ground in northern Brittany and Normandy from the afternoon of the 27th. During the night, the snow reached northeastern France as far as the Genevois, leaving flakes south of the Paris region. Meanwhile, significant amounts of rain caused flooding along its path. In some areas of the Alps, snowfall lasted two days, with the snow layer reaching about two meters."

        "content": "After the 1987 storm, European meteorological services improved their numerical weather prediction models. In 1999, Météo-France was able to predict the occurrence of the two storms. Based on existing models and exceptional variations in measured temperatures and pressure, Météo-France was able to issue a severe weather warning for strong winds 24 hours before the Lothar storm. Météo-France forecasters at all levels work closely with Civil Security services. On December 26 at 5:25 a.m., the Interministerial Crisis Management Operational Center (COGIC) of the Directorate of Civil Defense and Security (DDSC) received a phone call from Météo-France announcing that strong winds were heading towards Île-de-France and the eastern, northern, and central parts of the country. This phone report was confirmed by the issuance of a meteorological alarm bulletin (BAM) at 6:45 a.m., confirming a strong wind phenomenon with an average speed of 80 km/h, gusts of 120 km/h, and locally reaching up to 140 km/h. While the population was warned of an exceptional weather event, the strength of the gusts exceeded the forecasts. At 7:30 a.m., Météo-France announced an update to the BAM, reporting a windy episode that could last one to two hours in Île-de-France and the central region, with winds potentially reaching 140 km/h or even locally 160 km/h. At 8:15 a.m., Civil Security, at the request of Météo-France, prepared a press release to warn residents of the affected areas about the significant risks posed by the announced winds. The press alert, initially relayed by national bulletins from the Radio France group, came as the Lothar storm was already hitting Normandy. The short time between the alert issued by Météo-France and the occurrence of the storm did not allow for earlier communication to the population about the severity of the phenomenon. Furthermore, the alert was issued at the end of the night, the day after Christmas celebrations, a time when media consumption is low and populations are difficult to mobilize."

They mention wind gusts of up to 130 km/h inland and 150 km/h on the coasts and highlands. An alert bulletin is also issued for snowfall in Brittany. As was the case with Storm Lothar, the population remains largely unprepared due to insufficient anticipation in the alert chain and underestimation of the wind strength. Awareness of the intensity of the phenomenon, both by public authorities and the population, only occurs from 7:50 PM with the dissemination of the first information on major damage (collapse of the glass roof of La Rochelle station) in France Info's regular bulletins."

Several local emergency service officials did not realize the importance of the storms and did not take the necessary measures, partly because it was during the Christmas holidays. Deutscher Wetterdienst (the German service) was criticized for not issuing an alert for Lothar. A post-analysis mentions that there was a computer problem in its communication system."

        "content": "Nearly 540 high and very high voltage lines and more than a thousand electrical pylons are out of service, representing about 8% of the electricity transmission network. Power outages affect 3.6 million households - or 10 million French people. Some departments are largely without electricity (Orne, Creuse, Corrèze, Haute-Vienne, Cantal, Lot-et-Garonne), and some entirely (Vosges, Charente-Maritime). Due to energy shortages and pollution affecting water distribution, 2.5 million residents must obtain water from stores. To restore its network, EDF relied on the help of around twenty countries, which provided personnel (1,500 technicians) and specialized equipment. A large part of the road network is impassable on Monday, December 27, including major routes such as the A10 motorway and National Route 10. Nearly 20,000 km of roads and forest trails providing access to massifs are damaged. Out of 32,000 km of railway tracks, 20,000 km are rendered unusable. The mobilization of 18,000 railway workers allows 95% of installations to be restored by December 31. Rail traffic returns to normal after a week. The costs of restoration and operational losses for SNCF amount to 510 million francs. Numerous flights are canceled, and some airports (Bordeaux-Mérignac, Clermont-Ferrand) are closed. Nearly one million subscribers are without landline telephone service due to fallen trees on overhead telephone lines and the rapid depletion of backup batteries in telephone exchanges and relay antennas. Nearly 3,500 mobile phone relay antennas (Itinéris, SFR, Bouygues Télécom) are out of service. The restoration of telephone networks cost approximately 1 billion francs for France Télécom, 100 million francs for SFR, and nearly 20 million for Bouygues Télécom. The near-identical reconstruction of France Télécom's telephone network will not be completed until April 2001."

        "content": "The forestry and agricultural damage is considerable, particularly in the timber sector. Hundreds of thousands of trees have been felled, with waterlogged soils contributing to their instability. The first estimate of this damage, carried out by the Regional Forestry and Timber Services (SRFB), evaluates the volume of felled (windthrow) and broken (breakage) wood at 140 million cubic meters (with a margin of error of 30%, i.e., between 98 and 182 million). The most affected regions are Lorraine (29.5 million cubic meters), Aquitaine (27.7), and Limousin (16.3). The resistance of trees varied depending on species and geographical areas: poplars in the Garonne and oaks in the Adour fared better than pines in Médoc and Douglas firs in Limousin, with mountainous areas faring better than plains. A subsequent and more precise assessment of the damage raised the windthrow volume to 176 million cubic meters. The extent of the damage, partly linked to poor forestry management, led foresters to question the practices that had prevailed until then. While viticulture was relatively spared, market gardeners and horticulturists saw thousands of hectares of greenhouses destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of fruit trees were felled or damaged in southwestern France, notably plum trees in Lot-et-Garonne and walnut trees in Périgord. The reconstruction of these orchards took about fifteen years. However, the livestock sector suffered the most significant damage (drowned animals, damaged or destroyed buildings). Stocks of fodder and silage were waterlogged, and cows had to be milked manually due to a lack of electricity, resulting in the loss of several million liters of milk. Power outages affected artificial incubators, freezers, and refrigeration systems. Many food businesses relying on cold storage (supermarkets, restaurants, bakeries, caterers) lost their entire stock during a period of high activity. Order and transport flows were disrupted, and the sector was affected by technical unemployment measures. On the Atlantic coast, the storm surge reached 40 to 60 cm, and 1.5 to 2 meters in Charente-Maritime. A quarter of the oyster farming facilities in the Marennes-Oléron basin were completely destroyed. However, some sectors benefited from unexpected expenditures, such as construction, public works, producers of building materials, and DIY equipment."

        "content": "The cost borne by insurance companies is significantly higher than that of the 1990 storms, which amounted to 8.6 billion francs. The French reinsurance group Scor estimated the total damages at nearly 33 billion francs. In 2000, the French Federation of Insurance Companies (FFSA) estimated the damages at 44.3 billion francs (6.75 billion euros), excluding deductibles, damages whose undeclared costs remained the responsibility of individuals and businesses, operating losses due to the temporary closure of factories, workshops, and shops, as well as the partial destruction of forest heritage. Compensation in France reached 7.5 billion euros under the \"storm\" guarantee and 275 million euros for floods. Half of the compensation was financed by reinsurers, while the rest was covered by the reserves of insurance companies and the Central Reinsurance Fund (CCR). Insurance companies were led to define stricter loss criteria, and reinsurance companies (Munich Re, Swiss Re, etc.) increased their rates by 5 to 30%. Faced with a significant decrease in the provisions of the Central Reinsurance Fund, public authorities significantly modified the surcharge rate for natural disasters, the deductibles applicable in the event of a claim, and the conditions of reinsurance. The financial burden on the state for the restoration of French forest heritage reached 2 billion francs in emergency aid in 2000, 12 billion in subsidized loans at 1.5%, 6 billion francs in subsidies over ten years for reconstruction, and 2 billion francs in \"storm\" amendments to state-region plan contracts."

The coordination of rescue operations was relayed with varying degrees of efficiency in the departments by the prefects with the establishment of crisis command centers. At the level of defense and security zones, the implementation of rescue efforts included the use of the interregional civil security coordination centers (CIRCOSC), but several affected zones (Center-West, Center-East) did not have any. At the national level, the government activated the decision support operations center (COAD) of the Ministry of the Interior and the joint operations center (COIA) under the Chief of Defense Staff. The COAD organized the dispatch of reinforcement columns of firefighters from the SDIS of departments spared by the storm and the assembly of civil security military units (UIISC) dispersed across various operational theaters (floods in Venezuela, the Erika shipwreck in Brittany). The army's intervention began quickly with the spontaneous engagement of units, initiated by corps commanders or base commanders, in the form of patrols aimed at ensuring the safety of people and the preliminary clearing of the road network. Within 48 hours, the COIA took over the coordination of army interventions in liaison with the military defense districts. Additionally, local initiatives attempted to compensate for the delayed arrival of rescue efforts in some isolated areas: creation of essential supply hubs at the cantonal level (Doubs, Charente-Maritime), visits to residents without means of contact by postal workers (Creuse), and a generator exchange market (Cantal)."

Its objective is to prepare teaching teams, staff, and children in educational facilities for a crisis situation. As early as 2000, EDF, then the manager of the electricity distribution network in France, set up a Rapid Electricity Intervention Force (FIRE) composed of 2,500 volunteer technicians (2,300 initially), divided into 16 autonomous regional teams that can be mobilized at any time to restore electricity distribution to subscribers using heavy logistical means (generators, helicopter resources). By early 2007, although some areas remained untreated, most of the zones with fallen trees had been cleared."

Rainfall, exceeding 174 millimeters in some areas such as La Goulette, also caused traffic disruptions in Tunis and on several roads. Most neighborhoods in the medina of Tunis as well as several streets in the capital were also flooded. In the capital region, 77 millimeters of rain were recorded between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. The presidency later announced the cancellation of the ceremony organized on October 15 to mark the anniversary of the evacuation of the city of Bizerte by French troops in 1963.

Initial investigations revealed that the poor condition of the national road connecting Tunis to Bizerte was also a major cause of the high number of deaths in this area. On October 15, President Ben Ali convened a ministerial council that decided the Sabalet Ben Ammar area would be declared a flood-prone zone, prohibiting the issuance of any building permits and requiring that nothing obstruct the flow of water. Furthermore, any new construction project must be preceded by a mandatory hydraulic study, and coordination between the relevant ministries must be improved."

This event has also affected the entirety of Europe. Even though the low-water period decreased in the winter of 2022-2023, the recharge period was insufficient, and restrictions multiplied, leading to another drought in 2023. This situation results from a rainfall deficit starting in the winter of 2021-2022, which continued with a spring and early summer also marked by low rainfall, combined with several significant heatwaves that contributed to drying out the soil. This drought is simultaneously pluviometric (the observed deficit is the most significant after that of 1976), agricultural (the most severe since 1958), and hydrological (numerous rivers have dried up, and groundwater levels are low). Very large fires, some classified as megafires, broke out, mainly in Gironde but also in Brittany, Drôme, and Aveyron. The burned area in France, over 62,000 hectares as of August 20, is 7.5 times higher than the annual average of the previous fifteen years (2006-2021) but remains lower than that of 1976 (104,000 hectares burned during the year, including 88,000 during the summer). Agriculture was affected due to the dryness of the soil but also by irrigation bans that resulted from it. The management of this event by state services and local authorities is marked by the implementation of the organization defined in the 2021 decree, namely monitoring followed by the triggering of alerts and departmental orders for temporary restrictions on water use. At the peak of the event, 93 departments were affected by restrictions beyond vigilance in at least part of their territory: 3 were on alert, 12 on heightened alert, and 78 in crisis. The event raises many questions about future droughts, the means to anticipate them, and how to address them. Controversies arise, particularly regarding swimming pools, private jets, and the watering of sports fields. In this context, the government initiated discussions in the fall for the development of the third national climate change adaptation plan for the 2023-2028 period."

Disturbances were infrequent in the south of the country but were accompanied by heavy snowfall and abundant precipitation in the Pyrenees in early December and early January, causing significant flooding and inundations from the Landes and Pyrénées-Atlantiques to Ariège. Temperatures remained very mild for the season for much of the winter. Across France and for the season, the average temperature of 6.6°C was 1.2°C above the 1981-2010 normal. On average across France, the rainfall deficit exceeded 10%. The deficit often exceeded 50% from Languedoc-Roussillon to the Cévennes as well as from Var to Alpes-Maritimes and in eastern Corsica. It was locally over 80% in Hérault and the eastern coastline of Haute-Corse. This winter is thus ranked among the ten driest winters in the 1959-2022 period in the PACA region, Languedoc-Roussillon, and Corsica."

The deficit exceeded 60% in some areas of the Massif Central, along the Rhône Valley, and near the Belgian border. Conversely, rainfall totals were locally above average in eastern Corsica. According to Christian Viel, a climatologist at Météo-France, the exceptional drought in July and August results from the combination of two main factors: \"The first rainfall deficit occurred at the worst time, during the recharge period of groundwater in winter, from September to March, and was followed by an extremely dry spring with very high temperatures, which has now led to very dry conditions.\""

In terms of rainfall, a deficit of nearly 85% compared to the 1981-2010 normal was observed in July. This month was thus the driest on record for the 1959-2022 period on a national scale. It ranked as the second driest month across all months, behind March 1961, which had a deficit of nearly 90% with an average of 7.8 mm across the country. Hydrologically, after June, the situation continued to deteriorate in July. The number of hydrometric stations with a monthly average flow close to or above normal remained below 10%, with only 8% of stations showing a flow rate above 80% of the average annual flow observed in July (the same value as in June). Nearly half of the stations showed a flow rate below 40%, with the situation being particularly critical in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, PACA, and Pays de la Loire, and now worsening in Brittany, Lorraine, and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.

However, as the soils continue to be extremely compact and dry, they promote runoff at the expense of water infiltration, a necessary condition for recharging aquifers, which act as underground reserves. The BRGM predicts that at the start of winter 2022-2023, aquifer levels will be significantly lower than the previous year and recommends maintaining water usage restrictions. As of September 15, 96 departments – the entirety of the mainland, including Paris – are under vigilance, alert, or worse, with 77 in crisis. October is extremely warm and fairly dry across France, which is problematic in terms of combating drought. Surface soil dryness reappears, and aquifers are not recharging. Water usage restrictions remain widespread across the country. In Roussillon, an extreme drought persists. In November, rain returns to most regions, but the results are mixed: while the Channel coasts and the Atlantic facade receive much more rain than usual, the eastern two-thirds of the country do not receive quite enough rain, and aquifer recharge is therefore not very effective. Nevertheless, surface soil dryness has significantly decreased or even disappeared in most regions, except for Roussillon, which is still experiencing an extreme drought."

The first meeting takes place on March 16, 2022, to review the evolution of the hydrological situation since the end of summer 2021 and the recharge of aquifers. The committee takes note of the indicators provided by Météo-France, including an average rainfall deficit of about 16% compared to normal for the period from September 2021 to February 2022 (except for the Pyrenean departments) and by the BRGM regarding groundwater levels, which specifies that in February, their levels are generally below monthly normals, ranging from moderately low to low. In light of this observation, Bérangère Abba, Secretary of State for Biodiversity under the Minister of Ecological Transition, announces the holding of a national crisis management exercise in April, based on a scenario of an intense drought episode following a heatwave. The second meeting, held on May 18, notes that the summer of 2022 could be marked by low water levels or significant drops in aquifers across the entire territory and that the regions of Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, the north of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Pays de la Loire, and Centre-Val de Loire could be particularly affected. During this meeting, the France Nature Environnement association warns about the increase in irrigation in France, which adds pressure to an already severely threatened water resource. According to figures from the 2020 general agricultural census, the utilized agricultural area is decreasing, but the share of irrigated utilized agricultural area has increased by 14% between 2010 and 2020. For example, the Occitanie region, which is already experiencing significant difficulties in water management, sees a 12.90% increase in its irrigated utilized agricultural area. The July 13 meeting acknowledges the extreme drought affecting the territory and recalls the government's mobilization on the issue, particularly the meetings of water resource committees organized at the prefectural level, with the aim of quickly informing stakeholders of the restriction measures to be taken and facilitating their acceptance, as well as the mobilization of monitoring networks in connection with regional health agencies (ARS), with a situation update reported at the national level each week."

A departmental prefectural framework decree was issued on April 6, 2022. It defines the affected alert zones and observation stations, temporary measures for restricting or prohibiting withdrawals from surface and groundwater, as well as measures for restricting or prohibiting water usage, and sets the low-flow thresholds in each of the concerned watersheds, below which restrictions or prohibitions on withdrawals and water usage will apply.

In 2022, the winter low water level of the Loire extended with a spring that was also very dry and particularly low flows upstream of Villerest. In this context, it was necessary to begin releasing water from the Villerest reservoir, which was then filled to its maximum regulatory level, starting at the beginning of May, to ensure the target flow of 12 m3/s immediately downstream of the structure. The volume in the reservoir decreased rapidly, reaching minimum levels for these dates since its commissioning between June 9 and 23. Daily water releases were made for each dam to provide up to 100% of the flow of the Allier upstream of Vic-le-Comte (Puy-de-Dôme), 85% of the flow of the Loire downstream of Villerest, 60% at Gien (Loiret), and 30% at Nantes.

Nine megafires, fires covering more than 1,000 hectares, occurred in France in 2022, mostly affecting coniferous forests. The burned area (62,075 ha) is 40% higher than in 2019 (43,602), the second most affected year in recent history, and more than six times higher than the average for the 2008-2021 period and 7.4 times higher than the annual average for the 2006-2021 period. Fourteen departments have more than 1,000 hectares of their territory burned by fires larger than 30 hectares. The following table presents the burned areas of these departments compared to the average burned area over the 2008-2021 period. Gironde and Pyrénées-Atlantiques are the two most affected departments. Maine-et-Loire is notable for having had no forest fires during the 2008-2021 period and 1,782 hectares burned in 2022. However, it should be noted that the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis) is a service of the Copernicus program (European Earth observation program) that records burned areas in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East using satellites through automatic image processing without \"expertise,\" meaning without on-the-ground confirmation. Thus, \"controlled\" fires are also counted and skew the figures: for example, controlled burns (or pastoral fires), organized to clear summer pastures, which are very common in winter in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, are counted in the same way as criminal or accidental fires. The difference between Effis estimates and figures provided by local authorities can be significant, as in Jura, where 886 hectares burned according to Effis, but more than 1,200 hectares according to authorities. In parallel with Effis, the Forest Fire Database (BDIFF) also records fires that have occurred on national territory since 2006. A comparison of the two databases shows that the total value of burned areas is up to three times greater with data measured by European satellites than with those reported by field actors in the national database.

Based on official data and crowdsourcing from thousands of receivers around the world, sites like www.flightradar24.com or www.adsbexchange.com display the private jet routes of celebrities and billionaires. Similarly, several Twitter accounts pursue the same goal, such as the account @ElonJet, which shares on Twitter all the movements of Elon Musk's plane. Its founder, young American developer Jack Sweeney, has created numerous similar accounts allowing, among other things, the tracking of movements by Mark Zuckerberg, the Russian state, and a range of billionaires and celebrities. Other internet users have launched their own accounts, such as @i_fly_Bernard (60,000 followers on Twitter) and @laviondebernard (75,000 followers on Instagram and 31,000 on Twitter). According to the Twitter account @i_fly_Bernard, in July, the six private jets of major French groups (Bouygues, Bolloré, Artémis, JCDecaux, and Arnault) made fifty-three flights and emitted 520 tons of CO2, equivalent to the emissions of an average French person over fifty-two years. The aviation sector is responsible for 2 to 3% of global CO2 emissions, but according to a report by Transport & Environment published in May, private flights have a carbon footprint per passenger five to fourteen times higher than commercial flights and fifty times higher than trains. A one-way Paris-Nice trip by private jet emits about two tons of CO2, equivalent to the annual carbon budget target for a French person by 2050. Some decry the Greens' diktats, while others warn of the climate emergency and the irresponsibility of certain individuals, arguing that the systemic change required by the ecological transition is impossible without social justice. All sectors must reduce their emissions simultaneously and without exception."

        "content": "Shortly after the controversy over private jets, Julien Bayou, national secretary of Europe Écologie Les Verts, sparked a new controversy by stating that he was not opposed to a potential ban on private swimming pools to address climate change, although he later nuanced his statement by specifying that \"the issue is not to ban swimming pools, but to guarantee our vital water needs.\" The federation of pool and spa professionals responded by downplaying the impact of pools on available water volumes, estimating that the average water consumption of a pool is 15 m³ per year. With 3.2 million private pools in 2021, this represents 0.12% of national consumption, including 0.02% for filling new pools. This estimate also includes draining a third of the pool during winterization, backwashing filters, and water used to compensate for evaporation. Even though these figures should be put into perspective as they do not account for water consumed during draining to renew the pool water, clean the bottom, or carry out maintenance, the actual overconsumption of private pools in France is difficult to assess because the average household water consumption (123 m³ per year in 2017) varies greatly between regions, and it is challenging to attribute these regional overconsumptions to pools. In any case, various experts, such as the head of the water service at the French Office for Biodiversity (OFB), believe that refilling pools is not an issue compared to overall consumption. Conversely, others, such as the water network coordinator at France Nature Environnement, argue that \"the debate cannot only focus on the volume of water consumed, but also on its utility\" and that \"in times of crisis, every cubic meter counts.\""

        "content": "Several thousand people demonstrated at the end of March 2022 in Deux-Sèvres against the construction of sixteen massive water reservoirs, known as \"megabasins,\" intended to irrigate fields during drought periods. The project dates back about ten years but is only now coming to fruition after a lengthy legal process. The first basin was built in 2021 in the commune of Mauzé-sur-le-Mignon, already sparking protests. These agricultural water reservoirs, some of which are the size of fifteen football fields, store water drawn from groundwater and rivers. Their cost is estimated at 40 million euros, 70% of which is funded by public money. Opponents of the project particularly denounce the risk of water evaporation once on the surface, leading to a lowering of groundwater levels, as well as the loss of quality due to the proliferation of microorganisms caused by stagnation. For the project's proponents and the State, the construction of these reservoirs is an absolute necessity for agriculture in the context of climate change, and the existing regulations, already very strict, address environmental concerns and will be adhered to."

Subsequently, a decree related to the quantitative management of water resources outside the low-water period is published at the end of July 2022. While it is welcomed by the agricultural sector, some associations and local authorities oppose the changes introduced. This text modifies the conditions for withdrawals outside the low-water period: it notably introduces the possibility of defining \"volumes that may be available for anthropogenic uses\" and strengthens the role of the prefect in their evaluation, which satisfies agricultural representatives. Conversely, the association France Nature Environnement (FNE) and the National Federation of Conceding and Managed Authorities (FNCCR) consider that these changes challenge the balance established by the decree of June 24, 2021, and fear an increase in storage outside a substitution logic, which has been the guiding principle of the policy for rebalancing withdrawals."

It is located between the two main branches of the Rhine, the Waal on one side and the Lower Rhine and then the Lek on the other, which separate near Arnhem. The estuaries of the Waal and the Meuse cross the Biesbosch, a vast area of polders reclaimed by the sea during the Saint Elizabeth flood in 1421, near the city of Dordrecht. The Biesbosch thus forms a marshy buffer traversed by multiple small waterways, whose freezing occurs faster than in a vast estuary."

        "content": "The winter of 1808-1809 is particularly harsh, and many waterways in the Netherlands, including the Biesbosch, freeze. The Pannerden Canal, forming the section of the Lower Rhine at the division of the Rhine into two branches, freezes. As a result, a large portion of the Rhine's waters that were supposed to flow into the Lek is forced to pass through the Waal. In mid-January, the Waal's dikes give way in two places: at Lent, near Nijmegen, and at Loenen, a few kilometers downstream. The river's water pours inland like a torrent, destroying farms and villages. The bulk of the flooding is stopped by the Diefdijk, a dike crossing the Betuwe between Gorinchem, Leerdam, and Culemborg, thus forming a true inland sea. While the Betuwe is the hardest-hit region, floods occurred throughout the area between the Meuse and the Rhine, up to Arnhem. Starting on January 28, the King of Holland, Louis Bonaparte, travels to Gorinchem to assess the extent of the damage and support the affected populations. Louis himself helps reinforce the dikes with sandbags, coordinates relief efforts, and visits the most isolated villages in the area to encourage the population. To facilitate water drainage, the dike is breached at Dalem. These efforts are in vain as the Diefdijk also gives way on January 31 near Kedichem, and the flooding spreads across the entire Betuwe, reaching Alblasserdam. The damages are estimated by the Ministry of the Interior at 6 million florins."
