In Montauban, the capital of Tarn-et-Garonne, Arthur Poncelet, Adolphe Poult, his friend René Bousquet, and Marcel Lefranc save dozens of people from drowning. In the same department, the town of Moissac is the most affected by these devastating floods. The departments of Aude, Lot-et-Garonne (notably Agen), and Tarn are also particularly impacted. These catastrophic events led to a national day of mourning on March 9, 1930 — the first in France in the 20th century — after the then-President of the Republic, Gaston Doumergue, himself originally from southern France, visited the affected areas, accompanied by André Tardieu. The French government allocated significant financial aid to rebuild the devastated areas, supported by national and international solidarity (Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, Morocco), particularly in Moissac, the most severely affected town by these exceptional floods described as the \"flood of the century.\" François Coty contributed to the efforts by building four model farms designed by architects to withstand future floods, offering them outright to deserving families. Pope Pius XI sent a check to the Bishop of Montauban to assist the victims. The number of deaths caused by these floods is now estimated at around 700."

This disaster occurred on Monday, September 21, and Tuesday, September 22, 1992, in Vaison-la-Romaine, in the French department of Vaucluse in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region.

                "content": "The floods in Vaison-la-Romaine are due to a large-scale meteorological phenomenon in the southeastern region of France, affecting several departments: on September 21, 1992, heavy rains poured over the departments of Hérault, Gard, Lozère, and Ardèche, particularly on the Cévennes mountains. The commune of Le Caylar received 448 mm of rainfall in 24 hours, which was a record for the Hérault department until September 16, 2023, when Roqueredonde received 550 mm in 24 hours. These rains followed weather conditions above the norms for the region, with average temperatures higher than normal, combined with a low-pressure area in the Bay of Biscay. The next day, the rains continued in Gard, particularly in the morning, where the regions of Sommières and Nîmes were swept by a brief and violent storm accompanied by strong wind gusts, as well as part of Ardèche. The rain front then crossed the Rhône to affect the departments of Vaucluse and Drôme. The showers on September 22 resulted from a west/east storm front blocked on the western flank of Mont Ventoux starting in the afternoon. With this stationary storm system over part of the Ouvèze watershed, the commune of Orange, in the northwest of the Vaucluse department, received 51 mm of rainfall, while Carpentras, south of the Dentelles de Montmirail, received 212 mm."

                "content": "The first weather alert bulletin from Météo-France, sent to the Ministry of the Interior and then to local authorities, dates back to September 21, 1992. That same evening, the prefect of Vaucluse relayed this alert to set up security and protection services. On September 22, 1992, two additional messages from Météo-France in Marignane, late at night and early in the morning, confirmed the alert, announcing storms of rare intensity. Despite this, the rain, which was heavy over Vaison-la-Romaine in the middle of the morning, stopped around noon. The city's emergency services faced several challenges: the events occurred on a Tuesday, the day of the weekly market, with increased crowds; evacuation requests made to customers and tourists (numerous at the end of the summer season) at the municipal campsite, located upstream of the Roman bridge, had little effect. The first moderate downpour (17.8 mm) fell between 10 a.m. and noon. It was followed, in the early afternoon, by a much more violent one (182.7 mm) that lasted until 3:15 p.m. The teachers at Jules Ferry School, then located near the Ouvèze river, secured the students on the first floor of the building farthest from the river. The total rainfall in Entrechaux was 300 mm (300 liters of water per square meter) in six hours (possibly slightly more locally). For comparison, the annual average rainfall in Paris is 637 mm. During this meteorological event, nearly 1,320 km² received more than 100 mm of rainfall. The storm, of unprecedented violence, stagnated over the slopes of Mont Ventoux for several hours. It poured 215 mm of water in Malaucène, 179 mm in Vaison, and 143 mm in Buis-les-Baronnies. The heavy rains upstream of Vaison-la-Romaine were such that a mudslide, about 50 cm thick, invaded and completely covered the municipal campsite around 3 p.m. A water height of 10 cm already covered the streets of the lower town. The first news arrived: there were deaths at the Moulin de César campsite. The section reserved for the À cœur joie associative campsite—450 pitches—was swept away. It was reported that there were numerous victims in the Théos neighborhood subdivision, located on the right bank, which was submerged by the floodwaters. At the same time, a torrent of mud swept through the municipal campsite, carrying everything in its path: caravans, vehicles, and campers. In the minutes that followed, at the level of the Roman bridge, whose deck is less than twenty meters above the river's normal level, the water reached 17 meters, 15 meters above its normal course. Images of caravans crashing against the Roman bridge remain etched in memories. The fire station, located near the Ouvèze riverbed, was flooded, including the building and rescue equipment. The ORSEC plan was activated at 5 p.m. The water level began to recede only after 10 p.m. Of the three bridges over the Ouvèze, only the ancient Roman bridge withstood the flood, despite some damage to its parapet."

                "content": "Later, it will be learned that the same phenomenon had already occurred, at least once, in Vaison. In the municipal archives of the city, a deliberation dated August 1616 indicates that \"the city council had to repair the parapet of the Roman bridge destroyed by a flood that also swept away several houses.\" No victims were reported. In the 17th century, the inhabitants of Vaison lived in the upper town, and around the cathedral, covering the ruins of ancient Vasio, there were only gardens. The risk was, however, known but neglected. Before the tragedy, following the disaster of October 3, 1988, in Nîmes, engineer Ponton mentioned in his April 1989 report 62 towns, including Vaison-la-Romaine, likely to be affected by floods caused by rainwater runoff. Jean-Pierre Mazeillier had described Vaison's Land Use Plan (POS) as \"completely insane\" when he took over the technical services of the town hall and could not find any trace of Ponton's report. The 1982 Deferre decentralization law had transferred urban planning authority from the prefect to the mayors. On October 14, 1983, the then-mayor, André Thès, revised the POS and declared the right bank of the Ouvèze constructible over more than a kilometer. The area had not even been classified as a \"minor flood zone.\" The price of the land had increased by a factor of more than 10. Scientific studies were conducted on the 1992 centennial flood. They provide the reasons for the extent of the damage. In the area of the Salette torrent, a tributary of the Brégoux, itself a tributary of the Ouvèze, in the heart of the Dentelles de Montmirail, 200.5 millimeters of rain fell within five hours. The figures are known thanks to the Bernardins station in Beaumes-de-Venise. This represented a volume of 4.2 million cubic meters of water falling into the watershed of this torrent, which has an area of only 28 km². The report of the commission of inquiry on \"the causes of floods and ways to remedy them\" also mentions other reasons such as a specific geological impermeability in this Ouvèze valley but also aggravating anthropogenic modifications: \"an impermeabilization of the soil causing urban rainwater runoff and finally the presence of constructions in the very bed of the river.\" The Ouvèze is a 123 km river, originating in Montauban-sur-Ouvèze, in the Drôme department, and flowing into the Rhône at Sorgues, after passing through 28 municipalities. Many watercourses are tributaries of the Ouvèze, notably the Toulourenc, between Mollans-sur-Ouvèze and Entrechaux. Of the 820 km² of the Ouvèze watershed, 580 km² are located upstream of Vaison-la-Romaine."

                "header": "The assessment",
                "content": "This tragedy of September 22 caused the death of more than 40 people, swept away by the Ouvèze or its tributaries. The most commonly cited number of victims is 46 dead, plus one in Beaumes-de-Venise, regularly omitted from statistics. Thirty-eight people lost their lives that day in Haut-Vaucluse, including 34 in Vaison-la-Romaine. Among them were fifteen residents of the Theos housing estate and at least eleven residents of the Moulin de César campsite. This extraordinary flood struck many villages downstream of Vaison, also causing deaths: three in Séguret; an elderly farmer who went to fetch his cow in Gigondas, which was found alive; four campers swept away by the Brégoux waters in Aubignan; a pedestrian who tried to cross the bridge swept away by the Salette flood in Beaumes-de-Venise, as well as four missing persons, including a six-month-old baby. Nine months later, in 1993, a body was found in the commune of Roaix by a firefighter with a search dog from Vaison. Without the courage of a firefighter who saved 36 people with a borrowed boat, the death toll would have been much higher. As the waters receded on the morning of September 23, bulldozers and trucks were able to work in the streets to remove vehicle carcasses covered in river silt and all the debris it had carried. To prevent looting, the flooded area was cordoned off by the army, with soldiers monitoring the entrances to the city and the main affected villages and patrolling in front of houses. In the five years following the disaster, the investigation stalled. Only the prefect of Vaucluse, who was in office in 1965, was implicated in 1995. The judge closed the investigation at the beginning of 1998 after ordering new inquiries into the studies conducted for building permits. These \"clearly implicated the systematic concreting of risk areas, particularly the natural flood expansion basins of rivers and streams.\" Two years after the disaster, building permit applications were submitted to construct in the city's flood-prone areas. Some survivors in Vaison were able to resettle in Clos d'Ariston, a plot purchased and developed by the municipality. Few of them left the city, as insurance compensated them well, and others were able to purchase older properties."

Despite spontaneous solidarity, subsidies, and insurance reimbursements, the municipality became heavily indebted. More than 19,000 F per inhabitant (approximately 2,890 €). In the five years following the disaster, 115 million francs of work were carried out, equivalent to 17.5 million euros. Furthermore, this renovation had an increased cost. The final bill amounted to nearly 460 million euros in damages, including 20 million for Vaison alone. Ultimately, for this single municipality, the work amounted to approximately 26 million euros, of which nearly 8 million was borne by Vaison and its 6,000 inhabitants. While everything was done to prevent another disaster, it came at the cost of heavy indebtedness."

The first measure taken was to make the areas along the Ouvèze non-buildable. Seventy homes, including an entire housing development, were demolished. The riverbed was widened, and the banks were reinforced. Upstream, the municipal campsite was relocated and elevated. Where the Théos housing development once stood, massive stone blocks reinforced the bank, and a natural area was created. Further along, a fitness trail now covers the former Jardins de l'Ouvèze neighborhood, and the Eminées and Magnans housing developments have been turned into green spaces. The school was rebuilt. It is protected, like the lower town, by a long wall serving as a dike. Evacuation drills are held every year in all classes. If intervention were needed, the Vaison firefighters, thanks to alert systems, are notified of a flood in T + 2. Two hours, which cannot be shortened but are sufficient to evacuate everyone. The alert is given thanks to the installation of weather radars in Bollène and the Gard. In 1992, according to the mayor at the time, there were none, although there was one in Nîmes named Mélody, but it had been struck by lightning the evening before..."

                "content": "On the left bank of the Ouvèze, the industrial area has healed its wounds, but it has not relocated. Many have reopened their businesses on-site for economic reasons: relocating would have required both purchasing new land and rebuilding, and insurance did not cover it. However, a new business area was created at a higher elevation but attracted only two companies. Moreover, \"local media regularly report on local urban planning (PLU) being challenged and most often annulled a few months later by the courts. The main reasons are almost always, in addition to procedural irregularities, the transformation of agricultural land, often located in flood-prone areas or adjacent to them, into building plots.\" The primary cause is that land prices have skyrocketed throughout the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. Due to quality of life and sunshine, it is the region in France with the fastest-growing population, attracting retirees as well as active families. Thus, for some, the temptation is great to multiply the value of agricultural land by twenty or thirty times simply by reclassifying it as building land. In the event of a flood, even less severe than that of September 22, everyone knows that the damage would be considerable, including loss of human life."

A desolation that worsened in the municipalities of Vaucluse affected by the flood, with 2,300 houses or businesses damaged in the department, including 320 in Vaison that were either destroyed or required repairs. However, Vaucluse was not the only affected department. On September 22, there was a centennial flood of the Ardèche, which caused five deaths in the southern part of the department, between Pont-de-Labeaume and Aubenas. The Drôme department was also severely impacted, with water rising over 2 meters in some villages along the Ouvèze. The municipality of Sainte-Jalle was particularly affected."

It is estimated that the return period of the event is approximately centennial (a one in a hundred chance of occurring each year)."

                "content": "During the night of October 2 to 3, 1988, and the morning of October 3, storm bands crossed southeastern France during a Mediterranean episode. Radar echoes from the night show that the storm originated southwest of the Gulf of Aigues-Mortes (south of Montpellier). The storm system initially moved up the lower Vidourle valley, causing significant rainfall in the Sommières area late in the evening of October 2. The phenomenon then gained in size and intensity, heading toward the Nîmes heights, first passing through the Vaunage plain, where 250 to nearly 400 mm of rain were recorded on average over the entire episode, particularly in Calvisson. Significant hailstorms were reported in the commune of Congénies around 4 a.m. The rainfall reached 50 mm or more per hour on average over a period of less than 12 hours, equating to six months of rain. The torrential storm then spread and stalled over the entire garrigue plateaus overlooking Nîmes toward Remoulins. At the Nîmes-Courbessac meteorological station, east of the city, 263 mm fell during the night of October 2 to 3. At Nîmes-Kennedy, 311 mm were recorded by 1 p.m. The most intense rainfall core recorded was 420 mm at Mas-de-Ponge, on the heights northwest of the city. This considerable value is, however, underestimated because the rain gauge stopped transmitting data for about forty minutes during the episode. Locally, 500 mm may have been recorded, equivalent to two-thirds of the annual rainfall. The karst networks quickly became saturated, charging all the cadereaux toward the city center. However, the rainfall was relatively localized, as at Nîmes-Garons airport, only 6 km southeast of the city, only 35 mm were recorded. The very tight isohyet curves during the event are typical of stationary storm phenomena. The Nîmes urban area, located at the confluence of cadereaux, at the foot of the limestone plateaus of the garrigues, is particularly prone to flood risks from runoff. The first indications of flooding in Nîmes date back to the 14th century. Historical chronicles notably mention two major disasters equivalent to that of October 3, 1988: August 29, 1399, and September 9, 1557."

It covered nearly 100,000 hectares, destroyed nearly 23 km of dikes, and caused the death of about thirty people in the Maine-et-Loire department alone. However, upstream of the confluence with the Allier, the level of this 1856 flood was significantly lower than in 1846 and 1866, and equivalent to that of 1907. Many towns were partially submerged: Blois, Tours, Trélazé, etc. In the latter municipality, the Ardoisières quarry was engulfed, causing production to halt for several months. Many old houses bear flood marks of the Loire on their walls. Many of these date back to the campaign of commemorative plaque installation in the flooded areas, which was undertaken in 1856 to preserve the memory of the disaster."

In Lyon, the damage was very significant, particularly on the left bank, which was undergoing a period of construction. 18 people died in the commune of La Guillotière. Photographer Édouard Baldus, at the request of the Administration of Fine Arts, created a report (probably one of the very first photographic reports after those of the Crimean War) on the devastating Rhône floods in Lyon, Avignon, and Tarascon. We also have photographs taken by Louis Froissard, photographer for the municipal road service of Lyon."

This visit was not without political motives: he does not forget to pass through the commune of Trélazé, where the Marianne riots had taken place a year earlier. A decree dated June 2, 1856, allocates 300,000 francs to Lyon.

An initial heatwave hit the western regions of the country from June 25, with temperatures nearing or exceeding 40°C locally in Montana, Washington State, Arizona, Nevada, and California. In the following days, the phenomenon intensified, and record values were recorded in southern Nevada and western Arizona. On July 5, 43°C was recorded in Reno, breaking the previous record from 1970, while 47°C was recorded in Las Vegas. A peak temperature was recorded in Baker, California, where the mercury rose to 51°C. In Las Vegas, as in several other cities in the region, the intensive use of air conditioners caused a series of power surges on the electrical grid, leaving entire neighborhoods without power. In Reno, the Salvation Army opened an emergency shelter for people without air conditioners. A one-year-old child found dead in a car in Orofino, Idaho, was one of the first victims of the heatwave to be reported. The drought and extreme temperatures caused several fires to break out. In Utah, 1,150 km² of vegetation were destroyed by flames, forcing authorities to evacuate some homes and close access to highways I-15 and I-70. Three people died as a result of the disaster. After a period of relative respite, a new heatwave hit the country starting on July 9, this time reaching the Midwest plains, the South, and part of the East Coast. States like Tennessee and Missouri were particularly affected by the phenomenon, with temperatures nearing 40°C recorded in several localities. On July 11, 37.7°C was recorded in some localities in New Jersey. To limit accidents, the New York City municipality decided to open nearly 300 air-conditioned emergency centers. On August 16, Tennessee authorities announced a toll of nine deaths, while the Missouri Department of Health reported seven victims. In Illinois, eight people died as a result of this heatwave."

During 1947, temperatures were consistently above average from April to early October. Europe experienced three notable heatwaves (21 days): from June 26 to 28 (low intensity), from July 22 to August 4 (exceptional intensity), and from August 14 to 20 (moderate intensity). The spring had been abnormally warm, with unusual temperatures starting in April, as 30°C was reached in many regions of France during the second half of the month, and even exceeded in the south. On May 27, Saharan air swept over France, with temperatures exceeding 30°C in the northern half and approaching 35°C in the southern part. After a respite in mid-June, a first heatwave hit Europe during the last decade of June. In France, between June 26 and 28, temperatures exceeded 35°C across much of the country. After a break in mid-July, a new heatwave—comparable to the August 2003 heatwave—occurred from July 22 to August 4. According to Météo-France, it was \"the most intense heatwave episode since the post-war period, after the August 2003 heatwave,\" and even since 1873, the year when Météo-France's chronological data began. In some places, such as the Paris region, absolute records were observed: on July 28, 1947, temperatures reached 40.4°C. This record would only be broken 72 years later, on July 25, 2019, with 42.6°C. \n\nIn southern France, the peak of the heatwave was reached on August 2 and 3, with 40°C in Lyon and even higher temperatures further south. On August 3 and 4, storms brought an end to this heatwave. However, a new, more moderate heatwave occurred between August 14 and 20, with temperatures again exceeding 35°C across France, except along the coasts. A final heatwave took place during the second decade of September, with maximum temperatures still exceeding 30°C at most weather stations. In 1947, the heat was certainly less concentrated than in 2003, and the humanitarian consequences were less critical for a population less exposed. However, the episodes of extreme heat in 1947 were never as widespread since the beginning of records. The Alpine glacier systems recorded historic losses, which they would not recover from thereafter."

Seven people were found dead in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona. An elderly person was discovered dead in their home in Las Vegas, as they did not have air conditioning. In Oregon, about forty sheep succumbed to the heat, while more than 200 other animals had to be rescued. The paws of dogs and cats had to be protected from burns caused by the scorching asphalt. Additionally, and particularly in California, the extreme heat hindered airplane takeoffs, leaving them grounded. Numerous fires were reported, including a massive one in California that caused the death of 19 firefighters who were trying to combat the blaze.

More impressively, the 15 departments of Haute-Normandie, Hauts-de-France, and Île-de-France were placed on RED alert from Friday, August 7, to Tuesday, August 11. This heatwave is an exceptionally significant climatic event that occurred in August 2020. These episodes of intense heat are the most widespread since records began. Numerous temperature records were recorded. An initial heat peak occurred on July 30 and 31, with the heat arriving from the southwest and then moving towards the western and eastern regions. On July 30, temperatures of 41.9°C were recorded in Socoa (a new absolute heat record), 40.6°C in Cazaux (monthly record), and 38.3°C in Royan (monthly record). The next day, temperatures of 41.3°C were recorded in Vichy, 39.4°C in Nevers, and 37.9°C in Boulogne-sur-Mer. The heat then shifted towards the southeast, and temperatures eventually returned to more bearable levels. However, this respite was only temporary as a new, longer heatwave arrived on August 6. Numerous monthly and even absolute heat records were recorded on August 7 in western France, with 41.9°C in Bellis in the Landes (absolute record), 39.8°C in Cognac, 39.6°C in Nantes, and 33.4°C in Cherbourg (monthly records). Temperatures then dropped in the west, but the heat intensified in the north and east of the country. August 8 and 9 were the hottest days in northern and eastern France. On August 8, the mercury reached 37.1°C in Lille (monthly record). Also noteworthy on the same day were minimum temperatures of 25.2°C in Boulogne-sur-Mer and 22.2°C in Alençon (absolute records). The next day, temperatures reached 39.3°C in Creil and 38.4°C in Rouen (monthly records). The temperature did not drop below 23°C in Lille (monthly record) or 21.4°C in Beauvais (absolute record). On August 10, the heatwave lost some intensity but remained quite strong. It was not until August 13 that the heatwave subsided, with the arrival of numerous storms. On a national scale, this episode was shorter and less intense than that of 2003, but in some departments, it was of an intensity close to or even locally exceeding that of 2003 (for example, in Lille, where the average temperature over seven days exceeded by 1°C the highest average temperature recorded over seven days in 2003). The first half of this August was the second hottest ever recorded (though far behind 2003), and this August was the third hottest ever recorded, with a 2°C excess compared to the 1981–2010 average, behind 2003 (+4.2°C) and 1997 (+2.1°C).

But this high intensity led to the RED heatwave alert being triggered in Belgium for the first time in history. The record in Uccle was 35.9°C. However, this record had been surpassed on July 31, with 36.5°C, making it the third hottest day ever recorded in Uccle. The main victims of the heatwave's effects: 742 people aged over 85 and 600 others in the 65 to 84 age group."

That afternoon, the typhoon showed signs of directly impacting Hong Kong, prompting the Observatory to sound the typhoon gun at 6:15 pm, forecasting that wind strength in Hong Kong would increase to gale force. By 7:30 pm, the Observatory vertically hoisted two lanterns. Between 5:00 am and 6:00 am on November 10, the Observatory recorded a maximum average wind speed of 61 knots, equivalent to 113 kilometers per hour, reaching storm force. The typhoon passed over the eastern part of Hong Kong around 6:00 to 7:00 am. Subsequently, the wind in Hong Kong weakened to gale force and shifted to westerly winds, leading the Observatory to replace the black drum at 6:40 am. Later, as the typhoon moved north of Hong Kong, the Observatory replaced the black upward cone at 8:45 am. In the afternoon, the wind in Hong Kong further subsided, and the Observatory finally removed all typhoon signals at 4:00 pm."

Subsequently, a cold front caused the typhoon to turn northeast, resulting in the rare phenomenon of a typhoon reversing direction to the northeast in the western South China Sea.

The eye lingered over the Hong Kong Observatory for fifteen minutes, marking the first recorded instance of this occurrence at the observatory. After causing landslides, the typhoon began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone and continued moving northeast across southern China. The storm gradually weakened as it crossed the Taiwan Strait and dissipated on the 26th after making landfall in Taiwan."

It came within 400 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong but did not further move northward to make landfall in western Guangdong. Two days later, it made an unexpected 90-degree sharp turn, creating a rare situation of moving directly from west to east towards Hong Kong, passing about 65 kilometers southeast-south of the Hong Kong Observatory. The Observatory issued the No. 9 signal twice. The cold air from the northeast monsoon also happened to move southward, and the storm transformed into an extratropical cyclone the next day, moving eastward towards Taiwan. The Observatory headquarters recorded strong winds for one hour, with the highest hourly average wind speed at 65 kilometers per hour, coming from the east.\n\nThe Royal Hong Kong Observatory hoisted the No. 1 signal at 8:35 a.m. on November 23, then upgraded to the No. 8 signal at 9:05 a.m. As the storm continued to approach and the wind and rain intensified, the No. 9 signal was issued at 10:05 a.m. At 11:45 a.m., as the wind and rain slightly eased, the Observatory downgraded to the No. 8 signal. However, as the wind and rain intensified again, the No. 9 signal was reissued at 3:51 p.m. At 4:30 p.m., the Observatory downgraded to the No. 5 signal. By 7:05 p.m., all signals were canceled.\n\nWhen Hong Kong was affected by the rainbands ahead of the storm, gusts reached up to 119 km/h. Rainfall began seven hours before the typhoon's arrival, resulting in a total of approximately 108 mm of rainfall. The heaviest rainfall came from the pre-typhoon rainbands, with 40 mm recorded within one hour. The lowest pressure recorded during the typhoon's passage over Hong Kong was 989.0 hPa. The typhoon caused minor damage in Hong Kong. In Kowloon City’s Tung Tau Village, a mud wall collapsed, killing two people. In Kowloon Bay, a cargo boat was overturned by the wind, causing five people to fall into the sea, with one person sustaining minor injuries."

On August 16, the storm moved west of 140°E longitude and gradually shifted from a west-northwest to northwest direction, intensifying rapidly. On August 18, the Dutch steamship Sapoeroea recorded the typhoon's lowest sea-level pressure at only 886.7 hPa (26.185 inches of mercury) 460 nautical miles (740 kilometers) east of Luzon, making it the tropical cyclone with the lowest sea-level pressure recorded globally at the time, until it was surpassed by Typhoon Ida's 877 hPa in 1958. Later on the evening of August 18 to early August 19, the typhoon made landfall or brushed past the northeastern coast of Luzon, where Aparri recorded a minimum pressure of 969.9 hPa (727.5 mmHg). After passing through Luzon, the typhoon entered the northern South China Sea, and at 6 a.m. on August 19, it was located near the northern coast of Luzon, moving in a west-northwest to northwest direction. At 6 a.m. on August 20, the center was northwest of Pratas Island, passing within 10 nautical miles of the island, where winds reached force 11 and the pressure dropped to 967.1 hPa (725.42 mmHg). The typhoon subsequently passed south of Hong Kong and Macau. During the storm, Hong Kong recorded a minimum sea-level pressure of 982.4 hPa, an average wind speed of 98 km/h (53 knots), and gusts of 187 km/h (101 knots). In Macau, the pressure dropped to a minimum of 974.1 hPa (730.6 mmHg), with average wind speeds and gusts reaching 135 km/h and 190 km/h, respectively. Later on the evening of August 20 to August 21, the typhoon made landfall in western Guangdong and gradually dissipated."

On August 17, the typhoon passed north of Batanes in the early morning, entered the South China Sea, and moved west-northwest at a speed of 17.5 knots (32 kilometers per hour). On the morning of August 18, the typhoon's center passed a few miles south of Hong Kong and around 12 PM passed about 10 miles (approximately 20 kilometers) north of Macau, then moved into mainland China and gradually dissipated."

On August 18, the typhoon moved closer to Hong Kong. The Observatory hoisted the No. 6 typhoon signal at 8:23 a.m., and strong winds began to blow in Hong Kong from 9 a.m., prompting the Observatory to hoist the No. 7 typhoon signal at 9 a.m. Hurricane-force winds were recorded in Hong Kong at 10 a.m., with the typhoon's center passing a few miles south of Hong Kong. The lowest pressure recorded in Hong Kong was 971.7 hPa, with the highest hourly sustained wind speed reaching 72 knots (133 km/h) and gusts of 113 knots (209 km/h). Shortly after, the wind direction shifted to east-southeast, and wind speeds rapidly decreased as the typhoon moved away, with strong winds lasting only three hours.\n\nThe storm caused severe casualties and damage in Hong Kong, with storm surges occurring in the harbor. The sea surface suffered significant damage, and the harbor recorded a sea level rise of 3.2 meters, while Tai Po recorded a storm surge height of 4.57 meters. At least 100 people died, including at least 40 fishermen, and one person went missing. The massive waves caused destruction to both the sea and coastal areas. The British Navy submarine HMS L9 was swept out of the naval dockyard by the waves, destroying the dockyard's outer wall before sinking near the Star Ferry Pier on the Hong Kong side. A steamship traveling between China and India was swept by the waves from Kowloon Bay to the Yau Ma Tei pier, where it sank. Along the coastline from Shau Kei Wan to Stonecutters Island, 20 ships were washed ashore, some severely damaged, with at least two fatalities. Ninety percent of the ships docked at the Taikoo Dockyard sank, resulting in significant losses. In the Shau Kei Wan typhoon shelter, over 300 sailing boats or sampans sank, were damaged, or were stranded. In Causeway Bay, some sampans were even thrown onto the roads. In Yau Ma Tei, eight sampans were piled onto the seawall, with two thrown onto land. The waves also destroyed a monument standing off the coast of Hong Kong, damaged the wooden planks of the Central Blake Pier, deformed parts of the Star Ferry Pier's floors, and overturned the asphalt on Connaught Road.\n\nIn Tai Po, the storm surge caused severe damage to the coastline. The seawall near the railway in the Tolo Harbour area was destroyed, disrupting train services. A 40-foot embankment at Tai Po Kau pier was destroyed. Several embankments in Sha Tin were washed away, destroying rice crops. A family of six in the area was struck by the storm surge, resulting in four deaths. Tai O experienced even stronger winds, with 12 houses and 19 huts collapsing, though no fatalities were reported. The storm also temporarily disrupted the ongoing East Reclamation Project along the waterfront. After the storm, the reclaimed soil was washed away, but it did not flow into the sea, so the overall impact on the project was minimal."

During the storm, Macau recorded a minimum pressure of 963.7 hPa, an average wind speed of 115 km/h, and a maximum gust speed of 200 km/h. According to Joaquim Baião Simões' book \"Macau and the Typhoons (Macau e os Tufões),\" the typhoon caused significant damage to Macau, destroying and damaging about 200 houses and 24 shipyards, with 50 various types of ships sunk. The disaster resulted in over 400 deaths and 52 injuries in Macau."

The Hong Kong Observatory and the Marine Department hoisted Typhoon Signal No. 2, marking the first time this signal was hoisted since the simplification of the typhoon signal system on October 20, 1943. After the hoisting of Signal No. 2, three ferry routes between Central and Heung To, Tai Kok, and Castle Peak were suspended starting in the morning until the signal was lowered. Regarding land transportation, only passenger bicycles and rickshaws continued to operate in the wind and rain. Businesses along both sides of Victoria Harbour closed their doors and windows tightly, pedestrians were sparse, the streets were quiet, and many shop signs fell. Around 8 a.m., a floating corpse was discovered near the Central Keng Shan Pier, suspected to be a victim of a sunken boat, which was later swept away by the waves. The doors and windows of a shop along the waterfront in Chung Sum Yat Tong were destroyed by the wind, and one vacant building each on First Street in the Water City District and Gaham Street in Central collapsed, causing no casualties. The district officer of the lowland area toured the streets in the wind and rain with an administrative officer in the morning, giving instructions to citizens on typhoon precautions. By noon, the wind and rain had weakened, and the Marine Department lowered Typhoon Signal No. 2 in the afternoon. The \"Hong Kong Maru,\" originally scheduled to depart from Hong Kong to Guangdong Province at 8 p.m., had to be delayed by a day due to the still-strong winds. Prices rose significantly due to the typhoon's impact on supply, with the price of rice increasing from HK$7.2 per catty on July 21 to a peak of HK$8 on the 22nd. Sweet potatoes rose from HK$2.9 per catty on the eve of the storm to over HK$3, and the supply of fish and vegetables was tight, with prices also increasing."

They immediately ordered the hoisting of Signal No. 1 at the Guia Fortress, the Maritime Administration, and the Guia Lighthouse. On the afternoon of July 21, the weather in Macau deteriorated with heavy rain, and at around 7 p.m., Signal No. 5 was hoisted, warning of possible strong northwest winds. The city experienced strong winds and rain, and ferry services between the Macau Peninsula and Taipa were suspended. Ships sought shelter in the Inner Harbour typhoon shelter. At around 2 a.m. on July 22, the winds intensified, and Signal No. 9 was hoisted. The Maritime Administration's rescue ferry ventured out to patrol the Outer Harbour in case of emergencies. At around 7 a.m. on July 22, the typhoon appeared to be directly impacting Macau. At 8:30 a.m., the Meteorological Department ordered the replacement of Signal No. 9 with Signal No. 10, the first in three years. The Guia Fortress fired three cannon shots to warn of the approaching hurricane. Macau experienced a day of strong winds and heavy rain, with the Outer Harbour area being the most threatened. However, as the typhoon quickly passed south of Macau without directly crossing it, overall damage was minimal. An unmanned boat sank at sea, the New Reclamation swimming area was destroyed, the Nam Van Friendship Stadium was damaged, and many rooftop clothes-drying racks and shop signs were blown away. Several small trees on Avenida de Venceslau de Morais were uprooted. A shipyard in the Areia Preta area collapsed, causing significant cargo losses but no casualties. Streets such as Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro, Rua da Felicidade, Rua dos Mercadores, Rua da Praia do Manduco, and the San Kio district were flooded, with water levels exceeding one foot in some areas. Several old houses on Avenida do Almirante Lacerda collapsed, injuring a police officer. By midday on July 22, the winds weakened and shifted to a southerly direction. At 12:50 p.m., the Guia Fortress fired two cannon shots to signal the end of the hurricane threat, and Signal No. 6 was hoisted. At 7 p.m., Signal No. 1 was hoisted again, and all signals were removed before midnight."

From August 19 to 20, under the influence of tropical storm Rumbia, the Mi River basin in Shandong experienced extremely heavy rainfall, causing water levels to rise significantly in the Yeyuan Reservoir, Tangshuya Reservoir, and Heihushan Reservoir in Qingzhou and Linqu, leading to reservoir discharges. Although the reservoirs provided some warnings to downstream villagers, the time was only sufficient for residents to evacuate, leaving livestock and property behind. This event caused the Shouguang section of the Mi River to experience the largest flood peak since 1974, with multiple villages along the Shouguang riverbanks suffering from river water backflow, resulting in the destruction of numerous homes, farmland, greenhouses, and farms, and potentially affecting the stability of vegetable supply to Beijing. During the same period as the Shouguang flood disaster, there was a continuous rise in vegetable prices nationwide, which drew attention from Xinhua News Agency. According to official statistics, as of 5 p.m. on the 23rd, the disaster caused 13 deaths, 3 missing persons, the collapse of 9,999 houses, and economic losses of approximately 9.2 billion yuan. Since the number of collapsed houses exceeded 10,000, the government was required to initiate a national level-4 response. The figure of 9,999 collapsed houses was questioned for being overly coincidental, raising suspicions of falsification. Phoenix News published an article titled \"Shouguang Flood Disaster: 9,999 Houses Damaged, Where Are the Facts?\" questioning the data from the People's Daily client on August 23, which reported \"10,335 houses collapsed, 8,240 houses severely damaged, and 53,465 houses generally damaged.\" The article was later deleted."

Areas such as Yunlin, Chiayi, Nantou, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung experienced widespread flooding, with some localized areas remaining flooded for nearly a week. It was the most severe and prolonged catastrophic heavy rain to affect Taiwan since the Typhoon Morakot disaster. President Tsai Ing-wen of the Republic of China specifically instructed Presidential Office Secretary-General Chen Chu to stay in Kaohsiung to oversee disaster response efforts in southern Taiwan."

The Weather Risk Management Development Company stated that compared to the impact of the previous tropical depression, the rainfall brought by this heavy rain event was relatively moderate. The Central Disaster Response Center, established in response to the tropical depression, was dismantled at 7 PM on the 25th and reopened three hours later to address this heavy rain event. Premier Lai Ching-te inspected the Central Disaster Response Center on the 28th and emphasized the importance of strengthening horizontal communication between ministries and vertical cooperation with local governments to help residents return home as soon as possible.  \n\nDue to the continued impact of heavy rain, the Central Weather Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation issued an extremely heavy rain warning for Pingtung County on the evening of the 27th and heavy rain warnings for Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Taitung County. The extremely heavy rain warning was extended to Kaohsiung City the following day. The Soil and Water Conservation Bureau of the Council of Agriculture also issued 42 red alerts for debris flows on the morning of the 28th, covering 6 townships and 15 villages in Kaohsiung and Pingtung, and 166 yellow alerts for areas including Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and Taitung. They urged local governments to advise or force residents to evacuate and provide proper resettlement. The Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a level-one flood warning for 13 districts in Kaohsiung City and 5 townships in Pingtung County."

The Fisheries Agency of the Council of Agriculture also urged fishermen to take advantage of breaks in the rain to implement disaster prevention measures. The Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a Level 1 flood warning at 6:27 AM on the 28th for 13 districts in Kaohsiung City and 5 towns in Pingtung County. \n\nThe Xiaoliuqiu to Donggang ferry route was also affected by the heavy rain event, with reduced services on the 26th and suspension on the 27th, during which 2,500 people returned to Donggang before noon on the 26th. Ferries from Taitung to Lanyu and Green Island were also suspended on the 27th, leaving nearly 4,000 tourists stranded. The Maritime and Port Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications estimated that 58 ferry trips would be canceled on the 28th due to the heavy rain event.\n\nThe Southern Region Water Resources Office of the Water Resources Agency stated that in response to the second wave of heavy rain, Zengwen Reservoir and Mudan Reservoir were both undergoing regulated discharges on the morning of the 27th. It also mentioned that Agongdian Reservoir is currently in an empty reservoir sediment prevention period. To prepare for the potential rainfall brought by this wave of heavy rain, the Southern Region Water Resources Office conducted regulated water releases to reserve flood detention space."

On the same day, Kaohsiung City also recorded over 300 millimeters of daily rainfall. The intense rainfall caused slippery roads in many areas, leading to multiple traffic accidents. In Xinyuan Township, Pingtung County, a car crashed into a utility pole, resulting in one death and three injuries. In Zhuqi Township, Chiayi County, a car collision, possibly due to slippery roads and poor visibility caused by the rain, resulted in one death and one serious injury. On the 26th, the Pingtung County Police Department reported that a 64-year-old man went to Haishen Temple in Sandimen Township but was found missing after his car door was left open and the right rear wheel was stuck in the riverbed, marking the first missing person case in this heavy rain event.\n\nThe heavy rain also affected provincial highways. At the 260-kilometer mark of the Taiwan Route 17 in Qianzai Kou, water accumulation exceeded 20 centimeters and stretched over 100 meters. The Third Engineering Office of the Directorate General of Highways implemented road closures on the morning of the 26th. According to the Pingtung County Disaster Response Center, the Wutan section of the Ping 106 line in Taiwu Township was preemptively closed due to landslide risks. On the 1-kilometer mark of the 200A line in Manzhou Township, landslides obstructed road drainage, leading to controlled traffic. Additionally, the drainage system on the Fangliao section of Taiwan Route 1 was overwhelmed, causing approximately 20 centimeters of water accumulation on the road."

This move raised questions from netizens about the standards for declaring holidays in Pingtung County. Pingtung County Government Personnel Office Director Li Yin-ming emphasized that the weather forecast had reached the standard for suspending work and classes and stated that the top ten rainfall amounts on that day were all within Pingtung County. On the evening of the 27th, the Pingtung County Government announced that a landslide occurred in Shiwen Village and a collapse on County Road 146, causing traffic disruptions. Therefore, only Shiwen Village in Chunri Township, Pingtung County, would suspend work and classes on the 28th. The next day, heavy rain continued to fall in Pingtung County, with daily rainfall in several towns exceeding 200 millimeters. Severe traffic congestion occurred on the Linluo section of Provincial Highway 1 due to water accumulation, and flooding was reported on Guangfu Road near Pingtung Station and Fuxing South Road in Pingtung City, leading residents to question the county government's decision-making. Pingtung residents pointed out that the rainfall in Pingtung was no less than that in Kaohsiung, yet Pingtung County had normal work and classes on the 28th. They further stated that the Pingtung County Government should prioritize public safety. Pingtung County Government spokesperson Huang Jian-jia apologized in the afternoon, explaining that the rain was concentrated in a few towns and that widespread flooding had not occurred in the early morning."

He was accompanied by twelve bodyguards, and nearly twenty plainclothes police officers from the Kinmen County Police Bureau were deployed for full-time protection. This incident drew criticism from the public, with Kinmen County legislator Yang Cheng-wu blasting, \"He doesn't come when he should, but comes when he shouldn't.\" Presidential Office spokesperson Alex Huang stated that as a member of the government team, causing negative public perception and criticism of the team made Vice President Chen feel deeply regretful, and he extended his apologies to the public. This incident was compared by the public to the actions of former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who took time for a haircut before the 2009 Typhoon Morakot disaster, and former Executive Yuan Secretary-General Hsueh Hsiang-chuan, who had sweet potato porridge with his father-in-law after working overtime, both of whom were criticized by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) until they stepped down, highlighting a stark contrast.\n\nOn August 25, 2018, President Tsai Ing-wen of the Republic of China, accompanied by Chiayi County Magistrate Helen Chang, rode a Clouded Leopard armored vehicle to inspect Budai Township. Smiling, she encouraged disaster victims to stay strong. However, after traveling only about 50 meters, the vehicle was stopped by local residents who angrily shouted, \"If you drive further, just run me over!\" Kuomintang spokesperson Hung Meng-kai harshly criticized the incident on Facebook as \"the most arrogant disaster inspection in history,\" likening Tsai Ing-wen to a \"beauty queen on a parade float.\" Citizens also vented their anger on Facebook, questioning, \"Disaster inspection? You won't even step into the water for a show, and you come in an armored vehicle? At least pretend to be solemn or reflective! Smiling? Waving? Are you here to thank voters or campaign? Are you sure you're not in the wrong place?\" \n\nSeveral public figures criticized the incident. Chu Hsueh-heng condemned Tsai Ing-wen for continuously smiling and waving from various angles and at different times, saying, \"Her smile sends chills down your spine.\" Chu remarked that Tsai, who once held others to strict standards, is now being judged by the same standards, stating, \"If karma strikes, let it strike. Is it so hard to avoid double standards?\" Hu You-wei commented that the incident occurred in Yong'an Village, symbolizing that Tsai can no longer \"stay safe forever.\" He humorously expressed Tsai's sentiments, saying, \"Whoever came up with the bad idea of having the president inspect disaster areas in an armored vehicle, send them to the Ministry of Punishments for 80 lashes and then to the labor camp to clean toilets.\" \n\nChang San-cheng pointed out, \"The people feel no empathy from the government. They've been soaking in water for days and hope high-ranking officials can understand their pain, but instead, they see President Tsai riding an armored vehicle, 'aloof and detached'!\" He criticized Tsai for failing to \"share the people's suffering,\" lamenting, \"With a president like this, I truly feel sorrow for our country.\" \n\nQiu Yi-ying criticized Kuomintang Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Han Kuo-yu for attending a campaign song release event for a city council candidate, saying, \"Kaohsiung residents don't need a mayoral candidate like this!\" \n\nSubsequently, on August 26, Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker Tsai Chi-chang led legislators Lee Chun-yi, Ho Hsin-chun, Chiu Yi-ying, Lin Ching-yi, Lee Li-fen, Chou Chun-mi, and Chang Liao Wan-chien on a visit to Poland's parliament. This sparked controversy, as some questioned the appropriateness of the trip while flood disaster relief in affected areas was still incomplete. \n\nOn August 28, 2018, Legislative Yuan Speaker Su Jia-chyuan was spotted in Japan by the public, raising suspicions of a leisure trip. Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia stated that Su was invited by the Japanese government for an official visit, accompanied by his wife.

On August 7, Typhoon Ellen over the southern seas of Japan, due to the Fujiwhara effect, drew the tropical depression near Dongsha Island (081) into Taiwan. At 5 p.m. on August 7, the tropical depression made landfall in Budai Township, Chiayi County. After landfall, it gradually weakened due to the influence of the terrain and dissipated near Puli Township due to the obstruction of the Central Mountain Range. It then induced a secondary low-pressure system between Hualien and Xincheng on the eastern side of the Central Mountain Range and continued moving north-northeastward. During its movement over Taiwan, this tropical depression caused extremely unstable weather in central and southern Taiwan, forming a strong southwest airflow and triggering torrential rain.  \n\nThe heavy rain began around 6 p.m. on August 7 and eased by the afternoon of August 8. The southwestern slopes of the central and southern mountainous regions and the adjacent western plains recorded rainfall exceeding 500 millimeters. From August 7 to 9, the cumulative rainfall in central and southern Taiwan reached 800 to 1,200 millimeters over three consecutive days—particularly on August 7, when the daily rainfall reached 500 to 1,000 millimeters, nearly equivalent to the average annual rainfall. There were 15 locations where daily rainfall exceeded 500 millimeters. The main centers of heavy rain were concentrated in Miaoli, Fengyuan, Fenyuan, the upper reaches of the Wu River, Douliu, and Alishan.  \n\nDue to the difficulty in draining surface water and the occurrence of flash floods, river levels rose and breached dikes. The flooding destroyed houses and farmland, resulting in an unprecedented flood disaster. The affected areas included all agricultural regions of Taiwan, with extremely severe damage."

Among these, the Dadu River (Wu River) basin experienced heavy rainfall in its upstream tributaries on the evening of the 7th, causing the river to rise rapidly. Floodwaters surged southward, but due to the narrow waterway near the Changhua Railway Bridge, the water could not be discharged in time. This resulted in the left bank of the Dadu River being breached for 1,102 meters, flooding Changhua City, Hemei Township, and Shengang Township, making them the areas with the most severe damage. On the morning of the 8th, floodwaters entered Changhua City, reaching their peak at noon with water depths of up to 3 meters in the shallowest areas. The floodwaters began to recede afterward, with the city center clearing by the morning of the 9th, while the outskirts remained flooded until the afternoon of the 9th.\n\nThe upper reaches of the Beigang River received the highest rainfall during the August 7 Flood, causing the river to overflow its banks and flood areas such as Huwei, Douliu, Dapi, Douliu, Tuku, and Beigang, resulting in severe damage. In Miaoli County, the Tana Ba River experienced a sudden rise in water levels on the morning of the 8th, breaching the Wuhu embankment and turning Xihu Township into a vast expanse of water. In the southern region, rivers such as the Bajhang River, Jishui River, Zengwen River, and Yanshui River also overflowed their banks, causing widespread flooding in areas including Shuishang Township, Yanshui Township, Xuejia Township, Madou Township, Xinshi Township, Yongkang Township, and parts of Tainan City.\n\nThe actual disaster area covered 1,365 square kilometers, affecting over 300,000 residents. The death toll reached 667, with 408 missing and 942 injured. A total of 27,466 houses were completely destroyed, and 18,303 were partially destroyed. Transportation and communication in the disaster areas were almost entirely cut off, with over 130,000 hectares of farmland damaged.

A few days later, Washington ordered the helicopter carrier USS Thetis Bay (CVE-90) to redirect from Hong Kong waters, carrying 21 Sikorsky H-34 helicopters from the U.S. Marine Corps HMR(L)-261 squadron to Taiwan for disaster relief. The mission was named \"Operation Hunger.\""

                "content": "In July 1870, as heavy rain entered the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Jialing River experienced a rare major flood. Based on water marks, the peak flow at Beibei Station was estimated to reach 57,300 cubic meters per second (the 1981 flood flow was 44,700 cubic meters per second). The major flood of the Jialing River and the Jinsha River flood converged in Chongqing, forming an extraordinary flood in the main stream of the Yangtze River. The water level at Cuntan Station reached 196.15 meters, with a peak flow of 100,000 cubic meters per second (the 1981 peak water level was 191.42 meters, with a flow of 85,700 cubic meters per second). According to records from Wanxian, the estimated 30-day flood volume was approximately 165 billion cubic meters. At Yichang, the flow was about 105,000 cubic meters per second. After the Qingjiang River joined, the peak flow at Zhicheng Station reached 110,000 cubic meters per second. \n\nIn the northern Jingjiang area below Jianli, multiple breaches occurred, turning the Jianghan Plain into a vast expanse of water. On the southern bank of the Yangtze River, the dike at Songzi breached, creating a new Songzi River that directly discharged into Dongting Lake, leaving houses and farmland along the way completely destroyed. Modern scholars, based on stone inscriptions in places like Baxian, determined that the flood occurred from the 13th to the 21st of June. After the flood, Sichuan Governor Wu Tang reported the disaster situation in eastern Sichuan. On the Renchen day in July, the Qing court responded, instructing Wu Tang to handle the disaster together with the provincial administration and dismissing Xu Junyong, the magistrate of Fengdu County, from his position.\n\nIn 1952, the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission conducted an investigation into this flood and concluded that it was the largest flood among the eight major historical floods of the Yangtze River from 1153 to the end of the 20th century, as well as among the five major floods measured in the 20th century."

                "content": "The heavy rainstorm in Henan in August 2021 refers to the large-scale, persistent, and intense rainfall process dominated by the Huanghuai cyclone, which occurred from August 21, 2021, in Henan Province of the People's Republic of China and surrounding areas in North China. Since it occurred after the severe Henan flood disaster in July 2021 and multiple meteorological agencies and numerical models indicated an extreme trend in this round of rainfall, it received high attention and vigilance from all sectors in Henan. Before the arrival of the heavy rain, the Zhengzhou municipal government took preventive measures by preemptively releasing water from reservoirs across the city, and several public transportation services were suspended due to the impact of this event.\n\nAccording to China Weather Network, starting from the afternoon of August 22, the rainfall intensity in Henan Province of the People's Republic of China significantly increased, and Zhengzhou issued the highest-level red alert for heavy rain. Between 12:00 and 15:00, torrential rain poured in local areas such as Pingdingshan, Jiaozuo, and Zhengzhou. The maximum three-hour rainfall was recorded at 138.1 mm in Ligou Village, Lushan County, Pingdingshan City, while the maximum hourly rainfall intensity was 80.4 mm in the same location. China Weather Network warned that all regions should also be alert to gusts with expected intensities reaching levels 7-9 accompanying the rainfall.\n\nChen Tao, chief forecaster of the National Meteorological Center, explained that from the perspective of system configuration, this heavy rainfall process is a typical monsoon rainfall. The westward extension of the subtropical high allowed warm and moist airflows from the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, and Western Pacific to move smoothly northward along the western edge of the subtropical high, confronting cold air from the north, resulting in a widespread rainfall process. \"Simply put, the cold air from the north and the southwest monsoon airflow clashed, collided, and interacted in the southwest region and the Huanghuai area, forming a 'volatile' low vortex and cyclone weather system.\" Zhang Tao believed that this heavy rain process in Henan was different from the \"7.20\" event. This rainfall process was mobile and would not replicate the \"stagnation\" of the July Henan flood disaster, so the cumulative rainfall would not be particularly extreme."

At the same time, drivers were reminded to avoid traveling on this section unless necessary, and control measures would be implemented promptly based on weather conditions."

In response, the Zhengzhou traffic police stated: \"The traffic police department will not treat vehicles temporarily parked on roads, elevated bridges, etc., for emergency flood prevention as violations. We remind citizens to park their vehicles in a way that does not affect road traffic as much as possible and to move their vehicles to locations that do not obstruct traffic promptly after the heavy rain subsides.\"  \n\nAt noon on August 22, the Zhengzhou City Flood Control Office issued a notice requiring the implementation of traffic control and closure measures for 67 urban bridge culverts and tunnels and 23 small railway bridge culverts. Zhengzhou traffic police announced that entrances and exits of tunnels such as the Jingguang Tunnel (south, central, and north sections), Future Road Tunnel, and Hongzhuan Road Tunnel have been closed, with personnel stationed on duty. As the rainfall intensified, Zhengzhou traffic police deployed officers to key intersections and road sections, including culverts, bridges, water accumulation points, and underpasses, to carry out traffic security work. Depending on the rainfall, they set up warning tapes, placed warning signs and reflective cones, and fully cooperated with relevant departments in drainage and emergency rescue operations.  \n\nAccording to CCTV News, China Railway Zhengzhou Group Co., Ltd. suspended 59 passenger trains for one day starting from midnight on August 22, including 14 direct passenger trains and 45 regional passenger trains.  \n\nThe official Weibo account of Zhengzhou Public Transport Corporation announced that, according to Order No. 6 of the Zhengzhou Flood Control and Drought Relief Command, all bus routes in Zhengzhou would cease operation on August 22 and August 23.  \n\nOn August 21, the Flood Control and Drought Relief Command of Xinzheng City, under the jurisdiction of Zhengzhou, issued an emergency notice stating that from 6:00 PM on August 21 to 12:00 PM on August 23, the city would implement emergency evacuation measures. Except for rescue and livelihood security personnel, all work, classes, production, business, and transportation in the city would be suspended. Enterprises unable to suspend work or production temporarily due to special reasons must report to the city's Flood Control and Drought Relief Command and take appropriate emergency precautions.  \n\nAccording to the official Weibo account of the Publicity Department of the CPC Xingyang Municipal Committee, Xingyang City authorities initiated a Level I flood control response starting at 2:00 PM on August 21, 2021. All enterprises involving high temperatures and high pressure were required to suspend production; all outdoor work was halted; all street-facing shops and underground malls were closed; all public transportation was suspended; and all scenic spots, hazardous roads, and underground culverts in the jurisdiction were closed. Residents living in areas prone to flash floods, geological disasters, downstream of dangerous reservoirs and silt dams, low-lying flood-prone areas, and damaged houses were required to evacuate in advance and relocate to safe areas.  \n\nAccording to CCTV News, as of 5:21 PM Beijing time on August 22, Zhengzhou had activated a Level II flood control response. So far, 240,000 people in Zhengzhou have been urgently evacuated to avoid risks."

The first and most primitive of these is the defense embankment or lateral dike, an artificial earth barrier located on riverbanks, separating rivers from flood-prone areas. To prevent water accumulation, as it cannot flow back into the rivers due to the embankments, a set of river defense structures was implemented, forming drainage works consisting of storm drains, pipes, and rainwater drains. This system channels water to reservoirs, areas adjacent to the embankments, which are depressed zones whose main function is to temporarily store water to later be emptied into nearby natural water currents. This emptying occurs in two ways: by gravity and by pumping. Gravity emptying is achieved through gates in the embankments that connect the reservoirs at their lowest point with a higher point in a water current. On the other hand, the pumping system operates through plants equipped with motor pumps capable of expelling water outside the defenses. By 2007, there were four pumping stations, known as pump houses, in operation, with two more lacking electrical connections. Pump house no. 1 was operating at 65% of its capacity, with two of the five pumps not working; no. 3 was operating at 65%, and no. 4 at 80%. In pump house no. 2, on March 14, an explosion occurred in one of the two pumps, which, at the time of the flood's onset, had not yet been repaired. By then, 27 of the 45 available pumps were not functioning, representing 60% of the pumping system."

The plan was prepared by official organizations and NGOs, along with neighborhood associations and specialists on the subject, and was led by Venezuelan Pedro Zuccarini, a disaster specialist who had been assisting the city since the 2003 flood on behalf of the German Red Cross. The plan established action protocols for organizations and institutions, the dissemination of necessary knowledge among the population to know how to react, and the creation of the Risk Action Office, prepared to act before, during, and after a disaster. A year later, on March 20, 2006, Balbarrey ordered the creation of the Risk Management Subsecretariat, under the Secretariat of Water Resources, appointing Pedro Zuccarini as its head. In June 2006, Proyecto Santa Fe, a study center led by then-national Radical deputy Hugo Storero, conducted a survey of 360 people and 56 institutions in twelve neighborhoods in the west, the area most affected by the 2003 flood. The results showed that most people would not know what to do in the event of a new flood, being unaware of the new Contingency Plan and the location of evacuation centers, although Zuccarini later denied the survey, claiming that \"two out of five Santa Fe residents\" knew the plan and were prepared. Another finding of the survey was that a majority of institutions did not believe another flood was possible. Zuccarini traveled to his home country, Venezuela, in December 2006, initially for personal reasons and later, according to Balbarrey, to present the projects implemented in Santa Fe to other parts of the world. By February 1, 2007, he had not returned, leading to his suspension without pay, and he was ultimately removed from his position on February 21. The nine-person team of the subsecretariat continued working, divided into two groups, one in charge of fieldwork and the other of logistics. This occurred in the context of the Paraná River's rise in February 2007, which affected the residents of Vuelta del Paraguayo."

Only the northern part of the island-continent, which is already in the intertropical zone, as well as the southeastern mountains (Australian Alps), have a somewhat wetter climate. The Murray River, in turn, has an irregular flow regime and relatively low water volume, which is due to its long course through arid climate regions. Thus, although the Murray River with its tributaries (Darling, Murrumbidgee, and others) constitutes the largest river system in Australia, with more than one million km², its economic benefits for agriculture, industry, and potable water supply are not well developed, and there are possibilities to increase them through comprehensive basin planning. The Murray is a river that experiences strong floods and long periods of low water levels, so more multipurpose dams (hydroelectric, irrigation, flood control, and others) need to be built, infrastructure works need to be carried out to prevent damage in populations located mainly on the right bank of the river from the confluence with the Darling to the mouth, and areas with insufficient drainage (which in Australia are called billabongs and correspond in Spanish to terms such as abandoned meanders, oxbow lakes, marshes, or sporadically flooded areas, etc.) need to be channeled."

                "header": "Asymmetry of the Murray River basin",
                "content": "When discussing the floods in the Australian Murray River basin, it should be noted that, as it is located in the southern hemisphere, any moving body, such as river water, tends to veer to the right, that is, opposite to the northern hemisphere. However, this deviation is not real but apparent, as it is not the river water that veers to the right but the Earth's surface that rotates from right to left (east to west), that is, counterclockwise. This means that, in a moving body with a constant direction (such as the Foucault pendulum), the apparent deviation would occur from left to right, or in other words, clockwise, for the simple reason that the pendulum's base, that is, the Earth's surface, rotates in the opposite direction (counterclockwise). This is why almost all the cities affected by the 1956 floods in the Murray basin were located on the river's right bank. Among the cities flooded on that occasion, we can mention, including their location on Google Maps: Colignan, Iraak, which no longer exists and was replaced by a lake that is now almost dried up, Mannum, Murray Bridge, Mildura, Nangiloc, whose name is written backward compared to Colignan, Red Cliffs, Renmark, Wentworth, and others. All the mentioned towns are situated on the right bank of the Murray River (except for a couple of cases where the town is divided in two by the river itself, as in Murray Bridge, although this is an exception that proves the rule because the force of the flood affected the part of the city on the right bank). The case of Iraak, which is somewhat separated from the Murray River and is now almost uninhabited, is due to the fact that it was originally a military camp during World War II (it also held prisoners), and during the 1956 floods, it was flooded, creating a lake that still exists: on one hand, the location of the place was precarious and risky and was only justified by its temporary use as a military zone. On the other hand, the floods of that year highlighted the risk of that location and worsened the initial problem: it was probably easier to dismantle the camp and relocate than to carry out infrastructure works to minimize or eliminate the risks of that location. The Google Earth program is very useful for assessing the flood risk of any location in Australia (or anywhere) since by moving the cursor over the satellite image, we automatically get the elevation in meters above sea level of any point, which can indicate the frequency of a situation where a river's natural levees are at a higher elevation than the surrounding plain, which is precisely why it is called a floodplain. In the specific case of Wentworth, which is located on the right bank of the Darling River at its confluence with the Murray, the main reason for the flooding was not directly due to the rise of this river but because this rise dammed the Darling's waters upstream of the confluence, overflowing to the north of the town, which was almost completely flooded for some time. In a desert or semi-desert climate, most rivers are allochthonous and can experience massive floods due to irregular rainfall, which can be very scarce for years but also very intense and disastrous on some sporadic occasions, exacerbated by the fact that the large amount of sediment carried by the river's waters (due to the sparse vegetation cover in a dry climate) tends to raise the riverbed and natural levees, especially the left one, in the case of the Murray River because we are in the southern hemisphere. This is why most floods caused by the river's overflow occurred on its right bank."

It is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn in the northern part of the country, which gives this area an intertropical climate (savanna, rainforest in some places, and especially a dry subtropical climate). Most of the territory has a desert or semi-desert climate (Australia's deserts cover more than 2 million km²), and oceanic influences are very powerful, giving rise to tropical and extratropical storms, often very intense. In the specific case of Australia, the relatively dry climate makes it irregular, with years and even decades of very scarce rainfall and brief periods (weeks or months) of extraordinarily intense rains. In 1956, a rainy period lasting just over three months was recorded, leading to a massive flood that reached its highest point in Morgan, South Australia, at 12.3 meters, and these floods were felt up to 100 km away from the riverbanks. In the specific case of Morgan, its location on the right bank of the river (similar to the previously mentioned towns) is compounded by being situated on a 90° meander of the Murray River to the left, which concentrated the effects of the flood due to the natural right levee being lower than the left one in the southern hemisphere, so the centrifugal force of the river's flow in the bend was exerted towards the location of this town. This location can be seen on Google Maps: Morgan, South Australia."

Given the situation and the lack of a short-term solution, the viceroy proposed to the city council the option of relocating the capital to another city. However, the city council responded that it would cost more money to move the capital than to rebuild it. It was decided that the only viable solution would be to find an effective drainage method. In 1634, the Carmelite friar and architect Andrés de San Miguel, commissioned by the viceroy, corrected the drainage channel of Mexico City, which had been built by Enrico Martínez, allowing the water to flow out of the city and enabling its reconstruction."

At the time of the flooding, which occurred in the early morning, miners Jorge Sánchez Martínez and Enrique Ojeda González were working on level 55. On the surface, outside the mine, it was noticed that the fans responsible for injecting fresh air into the shaft had stopped working, and an alarm sounded for only 10 seconds. At five in the morning, a supervisor entered the mine and discovered the tragedy: the mine had been flooded. The location of the workers at the time of the accident is unknown, but it is presumed that they headed to a shelter on level 203, which was attempted to be reached in a second drilling attempt, as the first one failed. Simultaneously, rescue teams tried to contain the flooding using dikes. The miners' unions proposed bringing in robots and divers to cross the flooded areas and search for the miners in the galleries.

Despite this, the people's diet was sustained by consuming waterfowl, marsh herbs, roots, insects, and fish from the same lake. The year of greatest scarcity and hunger was 1454. As a result of the famine, many inhabitants left the region, some died in the fields, and others sought refuge in regions like Totonacapan (present-day Sierra Norte de Puebla) never to return. Ixtlilxóchitl states that the desperation was so great that some sold their children to the inhabitants of Totonacapan in exchange for corn.

A chain failure of the electrical groups in the island's two power plants occurred, resulting in what is technically known as an energy zero, that is, a total blackout due to the collapse of the supply. Five hours after the blackout, the power supply began to recover.

Thus, a significant percentage of the urban area developed on the periphery of the original settlement, creating populous and densely populated neighborhoods. After several decades, the inhabitants and the authorities believed they were completely safe, thinking that nothing and no one could devastate the already established urban area. They began \"reclaiming\" land from the river by partially filling in coastal areas, altering the ecosystem, destroying forests, degrading the soil, and building houses and factories in risk-prone zones. Large projects were also planned, such as a Coastal Avenue. However, these were nothing more than simple political promises. At that time, the floods of the Paraguay River were scarce, weak, and manageable. The inhabitants knew how far the water would reach during each event. But during the 1960s and 1970s, the floods became characterized by greater frequency, longer duration, and increasingly significant hydrometric readings. By 1979, with a maximum height of 8.32 meters, the Paraguay River caused significant losses and thousands of evacuations, serving as a sort of warning of what was to come. After these inconveniences, settlements near the riverbanks were reestablished, believing it would not happen again. By July 1982, a new river flood raised the waters to 8.68 meters, surpassing the 1979 mark, causing millions of pesos in losses and affecting more than 18,000 people, marking the beginning of what would become the largest flood of the century recorded in the Argentine littoral. From then on, the water remained stagnant, rising and falling but always within normal parameters."

The provinces of Santa Fe, Misiones, Corrientes, and Chaco had been in a state of emergency for almost a month, and even the Barranqueras port had disappeared under the ever-rising waters. As the situation became uncontrollable, Formosa was declared in a state of emergency; the Paraguay River had surpassed 9 meters, and the disaster began to worsen, first in the island and riverside areas, and then in the peripheral neighborhoods of the capital and nearby towns, threateningly surrounding populated centers without defenses or adequate resources to face such an overflow. Then, everything turned to indignation and sadness. The waters had already devastated towns like Clorinda and Herradura, cut off roads and highways, and were still advancing. In both the capital and Clorinda, the desperate construction of coastal defense works began, surrounding the urban core, built on the highest perimeters with compacted soil brought in by trucks operating tirelessly and piled up by road machinery, forming a containment barrier. This grueling work involved the movement of 340 trucks and 119 heavy equipment units between the two cities, the transport of over 1,000,000 cubic meters of soil, and the tireless solidarity of thousands of anonymous hands who day and night reinforced the embankments with sandbags, drove stakes, and fought to save what belonged to everyone. But the river did not stop rising; it kept advancing and surpassed the 10-meter mark with no intention of stopping. At the local port, activity was relentless; thousands of evacuated families with the few belongings they could rescue were assisted by every available vessel, such as the sand dredger Capri VI, which made tireless trips transporting populations from nearby areas like Alberdi in Paraguay and the most affected island sectors, or the Navy ship 'Piloto Alsina,' which served as shelter and assistance for hundreds of affected families. On May 31, 1983, the river reached its maximum level: 10.73 meters, plunging the city of Formosa into the worst chaos: schools turned into evacuation centers, classes suspended, basic services provided inefficiently, supermarkets out of stock, businesses closing, producers losing everything, and more than 10,000 Formosans deciding to leave a province that suddenly frightened them. But many stayed; they helped distribute food, clothing, and medicine among the more than 75 evacuation centers scattered throughout the city, reinforced the hope in the containment barriers, collaborated with Civil Defense, the Red Cross, the Coast Guard, the Air Force, the Army, and the Gendarmerie in whatever was necessary, trying to save what belonged to them and fighting to the end in a sort of personal battle to avenge the misfortune of nearly 70,000 people affected by the waters of a river that showed no mercy, that was relentless, and that exacted a heavy toll for human recklessness. By mid-June, the water began its steady retreat; it had calmed down and finally gave up. It left behind desolation, sadness, lost dreams, and for many, an inevitable new beginning; it also left in memory the recollection of the solidarity of a people who decided not to give up and fought to save their belongings and their dignity."

Partly caused by nature, the negligence of citizens and authorities has also played an important role. León was founded and has grown on an almost flat terrain that hardly allows for the rapid drainage of water that comes from higher areas after heavy rains. This excess water, which the rivers crossing the city cannot drain, spills over the urban area and causes catastrophic floods, large and with strong currents. In the early hours of June 23, 1926, much of the population was sleeping peacefully when they were awakened by street cries and police whistles warning of the danger looming over the city: the Río de Los Gómez was overflowing on 5 de Mayo Street! At dawn, the El Muerto stream also began to spill over the town of El Coecillo, collapsing fragile adobe houses and killing their occupants. To make matters worse, at nine in the morning, a second, more violent current followed, caused by the destruction of the dam wall of the Hacienda de Arriba.\n\nThe bells of the temples rang furiously, warning people to flee, but upon leaving their homes, they found that the streets had turned into rushing torrents that inexorably rose in level, sweeping away everything in their path. The current flowed past the facades, carrying furniture, mattresses, clothes, and a few human and animal corpses in its wake. With difficulty, people began to cross the streets, clinging to doors, window bars, or lampposts, carrying their youngest children and some of their most precious belongings on their backs.\n\nMost tried to reach high places like Bellavista and the hills of La Soledad or El Santuario, while others found refuge in the Teatro Doblado, the Seminary, the Municipal Palace, the Reforma Bullring, and even the Modelo School, Círculo Leonés Mutualista, and private homes."

With the distribution of Malaga's lands carried out after the Christian conquest of Málaga, the forests of the Montes de Málaga began to be cut down, and the lands were cleared for vine cultivation, leaving the city, located at the end of a steep valley at the mouth of the Guadalmedina, defenseless against storms.

The sudden increase in the river's flow caused it to overflow, quickly flooding the neighborhoods of El Perchel and La Trinidad and many other low-lying areas of the city. During the catastrophe, twenty-one people drowned, and many others were injured. The waters reached up to five meters in height, and according to witnesses, there was so much mud and debris that it was possible to access some houses through the balconies.

                "content": "Alfonso XIII ordered that, with the utmost urgency, the necessary works be carried out to prevent the recurrence of floods in Málaga. In 1908, the Málaga-born engineer Manuel Jiménez Lombardo presented the project for the construction of the Agujero dam to the Hydraulic Division of Southern Spain. The dam would retain the waters of the large autumn floods of the Guadalmedina, storing approximately 4.5 cubic hectometers, which would gradually be released through a tunnel with a capacity of 360 m³ and drains of 60 m³/second. Likewise, given the scale of the catastrophe and also in gratitude for the behavior of the city of Málaga during the shipwreck of the frigate SMS Gneisenau, the German government gifted the city the Puente de los Alemanes (Bridge of the Germans), inaugurated in 1909. The Agujero dam, although efficient in its limited function, could not be the ultimate solution to the problem of floods, as hydrological studies of the basin showed that it did not fully guarantee the city's safety. After decades of discussions and debates between supporters of solutions based solely on hydraulic works—civil engineers—and supporters of hydrological-forestry restoration—forestry engineers—the reforestation of the river basin was undertaken, accompanied by the construction of sediment retention dikes. In 1919, José Almagro San Martín, a forestry engineer from the 7th Hydrological-Forestry Division, completed the drafting of the \"Project for the Correction of the Guadalmedina Basin.\" Its execution began in 1929 with the arrival in the city of another forestry engineer, José Martínez Falero. Nearly 5,000 hectares on the left bank of the river were expropriated and reforested, and 30 hydraulic masonry dikes were built. Colonizing species such as Aleppo pine and stone pine were used, effectively fulfilling the protective and restorative objective for the basin's soils, forming the forest mass of the Montes de Málaga natural park. Years later, in 1983, 2.5 km downstream from El Agujero, the El Limonero reservoir was built with a capacity of 25 cubic hectometers, rendering the old El Agujero reservoir obsolete—today its gates and spillways are out of use, though operational, as the Limonero dam is located further downstream—and, together with the aforementioned reforestation measures, solved the severe floods that Málaga had historically faced. The last governmental initiative aimed at increasing the forested area of the Guadalmedina basin was carried out by the Málaga City Council in 2002, with the expropriation of nearly 400 hectares on the right bank, which were reforested in collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment."

On October 19, 151.5 mm were recorded in Vélez Rubio and 95.6 mm in Puerto Lumbreras, with a maximum rainfall of 300 mm in less than two hours in the part of the Almería province within the Segura basin. With such intense rainfall, combined with the lack of vegetation cover, the main basins in the area overflowed. In the province of Almería, the main receiving basins recorded more than 600 million m³, and in some areas, the waters exceeded 15 meters in height. However, it was in the Region of Murcia where the flood was most severe. In Lorca, a flow rate of over 2,500 m³/s was recorded in the Guadalentín. In Puerto Lumbreras, the Nogalte ravine reached 1,974 m³/s, of which 814 m³/s were solid flow and 1,160 m³/s were liquid flow, with a specific flow of 14,200 l/s/km². The sediment accounted for 41.18% of the total flow, 70.02% of the liquid flow, a very high figure when similar basins typically accepted values of 40 to 50%.[2] Successive floods were caused by continuous blockages-unblockages and landslides of tons of soil upstream of the channel. Notably, in just two hours, 12 hm³ of water and 8,000 m² of solid material passed through this town, destroying everything in their path.[1]"

In the province of Granada, in the town of La Rábita, the bridge passing directly above the urban center became blocked. This created a dam that, upon breaking, released an enormous amount of water and tons of accumulated sediment, destroying dozens of houses and causing the death of more than fifty people. In Lorca, 13 people died, while in Puerto Lumbreras, which was the hardest hit, the total number rose to 89. The flood destroyed 3 km of the national road to Murcia, overflowing the bridge over the dry riverbed, which stands over 8 meters high. In a letter sent three days after the disaster by the Mayor to the Minister of Finance, it was reported that almost all municipal services had disappeared, such as the Market Square, the Municipal Slaughterhouse, the Potable Water Pumping Station, the Weighing Scale, or the Fountain, trough, and washhouse of Los Caños. In the rest of the region, the waters of the Guadalentín River, to which the Nogalte dry riverbed is a tributary, in turn flooded the Segura River, of which it is a tributary, affecting large depressions in Sangonera la Verde, much of the Murcia orchard, and the Vega Baja."

This sudden flood causes numerous damages and deaths in the city’s plain, remaining in history as the so-called Night of Saint Polycarp. In the flood, 142 people who were caught off guard during the night lost their lives. The churches located in the river plain were seriously affected. The Roman bridge crossing the river suffered severe damage, requiring extensive restoration. Four arches on the side farthest from the city completely collapsed, leaving the city cut off on that side; in the following days, more arches collapsed until stopping at the central tower. The bridge was rebuilt starting in 1627, during the reign of Philip IV. The rains caused another flood in February of the same year but with lesser consequences."

This low-pressure center created favorable conditions for widespread upward movements in the central-east of Argentina, a necessary condition for cloud formation. On April 2, the development of an incipient frontal wave located in the west of Buenos Aires province, combined with a 1023hPa anticyclone located southeast of Mar del Plata, generated intense and persistent northeast quadrant winds over the east of the province. This condition favored the entry of humid air into the region affected by heavy rainfall, evidenced by the sustained increase in water vapor content, which reached maximum values of between 40 and 45 mm in Ezeiza in the early hours of April 2. The emagrams obtained through a radiosonde showed a vertical wind profile from the northeast quadrant in a layer approximately 1500 m high, which extended to greater heights on April 1."

There is a theory that the Buenos Aires/La Plata Highway was, in part, a cause of the flooding, as it did not have the necessary number of bridges for proper water drainage, an issue that had been raised but not taken into account during its construction. This deficiency would have left the El Gato stream as the only drainage channel. Thus, the specific observed causes would be: In 2007, a report from the Department of Hydraulics of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of La Plata had identified drainage problems in the El Gato stream basin. It had also warned about the need to address the overflow of the reservoirs on Avenida 32, which, during heavy rains, expelled water instead of retaining it. A fundamental issue would be the disorganized demographic growth of real estate in La Plata over the last ten years, which led to the disappearance of large green spaces, historic buildings, and diagonals. It was estimated that more than 800,000 square meters were built between 2003 and 2008, while one million square meters were constructed in the two years prior to the flood. It was also considered that the 2009 Urban Planning Code of La Plata allowed for the construction of more towers in the central area, which may have exacerbated the flooding. Additionally, there is an investigation against the YPF refinery in Ensenada due to an accusation that claims the closure of a canal gate, carried out to combat a fire caused by the storm, was the main cause of the flooding. The report from the Department of Hydraulics of the Faculty of Engineering of the National University of La Plata states that the hydraulic infrastructure works were not prepared for the event, that the meteorological alert was not issued in time, and that the actions taken by public officials were late, insufficient, and chaotic. The Municipality of La Plata is responsible for the rainwater drainage conduits. Furthermore, the Municipal Emergency Committee has an Emergency Protocol for events like this that should have been activated."

The death toll was 89, 70 percent of whom were over 65 years old. The investigation conducted by the Administrative Litigation Judge of La Plata, Luis Arias, opened the possibility that another 16 people may have died during the storm, although the number could not be conclusively proven. The aforementioned magistrate also ordered the adaptation of death registration procedures, the relocation of people living on the banks of the Del Gato and Maldonado streams, as well as the suspension of real estate developments, among other causes that generated unrest in political and business circles. The Administrative Litigation Judge of La Plata, Luis Arias, was later suspended and removed by a jury initiated during the government of María Eugenia Vidal. The magistrate received support from political, social, and human rights organizations. In fact, the Tolosa Flood Victims Assembly expressed its support for Arias for \"promoting a thorough investigation into the number of deaths caused by the flood.\" Neither Governor Scioli nor Mayor Bruera (the latter with a disgraceful attempt to conceal his vacation in Brazil) were even questioned about these events. The criminal proceedings for the floods in La Plata were closed with a single accused, Sergio Ariel Lezana, a Civil Defense official of that city, who accepted his guilt and requested the maximum penalty for the crime of \"breach of public official duties.\" Thus, the penalty was established as a payment of $12,500 and a one-year disqualification from holding public office. Lezana was the first official to be subjected to an oral and public trial for the flood and was to be tried jointly with the provincial Civil Defense chief, Miguel Ángel Di Lorenzo, but the latter passed away months before the trial."

The plan is implemented through the Directorate of Hydraulic Works, which will require an investment of about $2 billion by the province—largely financed by the national government—and will be carried out in parallel stages, with one of the main objectives being to widen the channel of the El Gato stream, which receives 70% of the water that drains in the capital region—carrying all the water from the urban area as well as that from the Regimiento and Pérez streams—and discharges it into the Río de la Plata."

All kinds of goods were collected and sent, including cleaning supplies, food, mattresses, blankets, and even appliances, coming from all parts of the country and distributed in the affected areas. Due to the volume of donations, organizing the shipments became complicated. Thousands of young people from across the country mobilized to the affected areas to volunteer in the restoration of neighborhoods that had been destroyed by the floods. Pope Francis donated US$50,000 to help the flood victims. Although most of the volunteers were self-organized young people, parishes and scout groups also participated, as well as young activists from political and social organizations."
