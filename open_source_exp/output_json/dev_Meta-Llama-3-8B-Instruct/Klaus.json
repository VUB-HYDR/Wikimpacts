    "prompt": "\n        Based on the provided article, which includes the information box None and the full text \n---Storm Friederike industry loss nears €1.7bn, 77% of economic loss insured---\nThe estimate for insurance and reinsurance industry losses caused by extratropical cyclone, or European windstorm, Friederike(David), has been increased by another 3% to EUR 1.675 billion, which suggests that roughly 77% of the economic impact from the windstorm was insured.\nEuropean windstorm Friederike struck the northern areas of Europe in January 2018, causing significant property damage as it tracked across countries including the British Isles, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany on 17th and 18th January.\nCatastrophe risk data and industry loss estimate provider PERILS gave an initial estimate for the industry loss from windstorm Friederike of EUR 1.465 billion(approximately US $1.8 billion) in late February, 2018, with that figure then rising by 11% to EUR 1.629 billion back in April at the next estimate update.\nNow, at the third estimate, PERILS has increased it again by 3% to EUR 1.675 billion, a figure which is closely aligned with the estimate from German reinsurance firm Munich Re, which put it at EUR 1.7 billion.\nMunich Re had also estimated the economic impacts of windstorm Friederike, putting them at EUR 2.2 billion, hence it appears that roughly 77% of the economic loss has been covered by insurance, which the reinsurer said was reflective of a \"high insurance density of windstorm cover in Europe.\"\nFriederike’s winds were particularly strong in the Netherlands and Germany, where a record gust of 203km/h was registered on the Brocken mountain in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. As a result the region experienced severe damage and disruption, bringing a number of states in both the Netherlands and Germany to a halt.\nPERILS said that the total insurance and reinsurance market loss from Friederike is the highest European windstorm industry loss since winter storm Klaus hit France on 24th January 2009.\nBut PERILS own data actually shows that the industry loss from Klaus was EUR 1.574 million at the time of reporting, so in fact Friederike is the largest windstorm industry loss to hit Europe since 2007’s Kyrill it seems, based on reported industry loss estimates at the time of the events.\nEuropean windstorm loss events have certainly been frequent in recent years, but the overall size of them has not been particularly impactful to the reinsurance industry.\nWe understand that in the case of Friederike there was an element of reinsurance capital including some programs that had participation from ILS funds which faced small levels of loss erosion, but that the majority was retained and dealt with by major regional re/insurers.\n---European windstorm could threaten catastrophe bonds---\nIt’s often overlooked that there is catastrophe bond exposure in Europe, most of the coverage is related to hurricanes in the U.S. or earthquakes. Only when an event occurs of the magnitude of this past weekends windstorm does it suddenly become a talking point in the insurance-linked securities market.\nA deadly storm(Klaus) blew in off the Atlantic and made it’s way across southern France and northern Spain on Saturday, causing widespread damage and leaving 20 people dead(at the latest count). Winds from the storm broke records for France with the strongest recorded gust hitting 184kph according to Meteo France. No estimates for damage totals have been released by either the French or Spanish governments but it looks likely that this could top the 1999 winter storm Martin as windstorm Klaus has affected a wider area of land.\nAIR Worldwide is said to be collecting and observing data on the storm, so we expect a report to come out within days which should detail more of the losses expected.\nThere are many catastrophe bond and insurance-linked security transactions which have exposure to European windstorms. Among those which could be affected are Platinum Underwriters Topiary Capital Ltd., Swiss Re’s Vega Capital Ltd., Glacier Re’s Nelson Re Ltd., Flagstone Re’s Valais Re, Catlin’s Newton Re Ltd. and Groupama’s Green Valley Ltd. We don’t have enough details to know if any of these are going to be impacted yet as often full details of the areas covered aren’t made public, but we do know they all have a European windstorm component(the exception being the Groupama Green Valley deal which is definitely exposed in France to windstorm). You can read up on details of all these deals in our Deal Directory.\nWe’ll keep you updated with reports on the storm and any loss estimates or potential impacts to catastrophe bonds as we receive them. related to Klaus,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Klaus, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
