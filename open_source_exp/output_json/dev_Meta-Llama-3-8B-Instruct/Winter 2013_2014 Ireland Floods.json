Impact Forecasting’s new European windstorm model replicates such clustering patterns by using a realistic sequence of storms originating directly from highly advanced global climate models.\"\nEurope has been hit by multiple European windstorms in recent weeks, not just Dirk and Xaver, showing that there has been no let up in the weather this winter. The latest, named windstorm Christina, has affected the UK and Ireland as well as northern France and some areas of Scandinavia in recent days as well.\nThe result of the repeated windstorm impacts on Europe is that the ground is saturated and flooding has become severe, particularly in Ireland and the UK. Record high tides and tidal surges coinciding with Spring tides have exacerbated the situation and caused coastal damage and flooding.\nRMS said; \"Since the peak of the 2013 / 2014 winter storm season started in December, Northern Europe has been bombarded by 14 low-pressure systems. These weather systems have swept in off the North Atlantic and brought strong wind gusts in excess of 90 mph in remote locations and gusts over 70 mph over large parts of the UK. Extreme rainfall levels have been observed across the country, particularly in Scotland where one location observed 73.6 mm of rain on Christmas Eve. The significant precipitation contributed to December seeing 154 per cent of the UK historical average rainfall for that month and in Scotland it was the wettest December since records began in 1910.\"\nThe position of the jet stream, very different to last year when the UK had cold polar air, is the main factor bringing the repeated storms to Europe’s shores, as is the prevalence of winter storms in the U.S., remnants of which are fed into the jet stream and propelled east.\nRMS explained; \"The succession of large and intense low pressure weather systems has been a function of a very strong and stable jet stream, fed by the strong contrast between the warm tropical Atlantic air masses and intensely cold Arctic air over North America. Although this sequence cannot be directly linked with climate change – the coastal flooding will be more common in the future, while winter rainfall totals are expected to rise.\"\nInsured losses in Ireland are expected to be close to the highs seen from flooding in 2009, when insurers shouldered approximately $340m of losses. An official estimate is expected from Insurance Ireland in three to four weeks.\nMohammad Khan, an insurance partner at PwC, commented on the impact of the UK flooding on the insurance sector, saying that the events could result in hundreds of millions of pounds of losses.\n\"The impact of the extreme rain and floods of recent months has become progressively worse. For the UK insurance industry, although this may not be the final estimate of the full costs of all the weather we have had, indications are that this could leave the industry up to £400m out of pocket. This estimate could develop further, particularly given the further flood warnings in place in the UK this week. Although the impact on individuals and businesses over Christmas has been severe, the 1,800 properties impacted so far does not compare to the 2007 storms where approximately 55,000 homes and business’ were adversely impacted.\"\n\"When including uninsured losses, the full economic cost of the floods will be slightly above the insured cost of £400m. However, unlike in many parts of Europe, weather, flood and storm events are covered by personal and commercial property insurance as a default option rather than being a potential add-on. This has meant that many individuals over the holiday season have been able to gain assistance from their insurers in ensuring the necessary repairs to their property.\"\n\"Despite the weather in the last three months of the year, 2013 has still been one of the most benign weather years in terms of insured losses. For many insurers who announce their year-end results next week, we expect results for those writing personal and commercial property lines to have positive results. Those insurers that have done most to understand the potential for flood, storm and weather events will have benefitted from this investment given the events of the last two to three months.\"\nBack across the Atlantic, U.S. winter storms in December are expected to result in insured losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. With the weather having worsened considerably into January as well, due to record low temperatures and snowfall caused by the polar vortex phenomenon, U.S. winter storm losses are likely to be high and we will update you when details of the impact to insurers and reinsurers are clearer.\nThe European windstorm and winter storm season has some months left to run, typically until April storms can threaten. Also the flooding event is still developing in the UK and Ireland, with more rainfall expected in the coming days, rivers already swollen and flood defences likely to be breached again.\nAdded to the mounting losses in the United States and Canada from winter storms, ice storms and snowfall disruption, the worst European winter storm season in years will bring unwelcome losses to insurers. No single event currently looks set to trouble the sector, but on an aggregate basis, including European storms since October, the flooding and the U.S. winter storms, the impact is set to be passed on, at least to some degree, to the global reinsurers who protect the primaries.\nHow big that impact will be is impossible to tell, but some impact is sure to hit the reinsurance sector given the amount of events and mounting aggregate losses of this winter storm period. Some impact is possible to collateralized reinsurers and ILS managers who participate in major European reinsurance programs. We will keep you updated as loss estimates emerge and the impact becomes clearer. related to Winter 2013/2014 Ireland Floods,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Winter 2013/2014 Ireland Floods, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
