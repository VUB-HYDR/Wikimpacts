In addition to people lost to these floods, other rain-related incidents such as collapsed compound walls of buildings have killed at least 21 people. Three NDRF teams along with the Army was deployed in the district for rescue operations.\n-Background-\nThe monsoon season in south Asia typically starts around early June each year and brings heavy rainfall and potential flooding to nation. However, the 2019 monsoon season started in late June and has been unusually heavy in terms of rainfall, with a 6.5% increase in rainfall averaged across India. In the Pune district, prior to the flooding, it had received 180% of its annual rainfall for the year due to the monsoon season, and its local Khadakwasla dam along with other three important dams were filled completely.\n-Flooding-\nMore than 16 centimetres(6.3 in) of rain was measured in Pune, Baramati and Pune district between the night of 25 September and the afternoon of 26 September which was the highest rainfall in last 10 years. Coupled with the existing rain from the previous months, flash floods started to occur. The flash flooding was caused by short intense periods of rainfall that overwhelmed water runoff systems like nullahs and flooded roads.\nThe full Khadakwasla dam saw an additional 8.7 centimetres(3.4 in) of rain during this time, leading authorities to release some of the water to overflow into the Mutha River at a rate of 13,891 cubic feet per second(393.3 m3/s) to prevent damage. Similarly, the Nazare Dam near Saswad was also at capacity, and its waters were released at a rate of 85,000 cubic feet per second(2,400 m3/s) into the Karha river late on night of 25 September, inundating areas of Purandar and Baramati.\n-Relief and rescue-\nTwo teams of NDRF were employed in the Pune city and two teams were employed in the Baramati. The flood caused 21 deaths, 5 missing and evacuation of more than 28,000 people living in the city. related to 2019 Pune flood,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by 2019 Pune flood, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
