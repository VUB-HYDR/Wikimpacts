With Credit Suisse not expecting any impact to its fund it also means that the DCG Iris fund is likely safe from windstorm Christian, as long as the insurance industry losses are within this range.\nCredit Suisse describes the storms impacts:\nWinter storm Christian(known as \"St. Jude\" in the United Kingdom) battered northern Europe  between October 27 and 29 affecting countries bordering the English Channel, North Sea and Baltic Sea. It was one of the strongest storms of the last few years and reached peak wind gusts of more than 190 km/h(119mph) with storm surges reaching as high as 7.5 metres. Christian first impacted the south of Great Britain early on Monday, October 28, then moved along the English Channel and across Denmark and reached north-western Russia on Tuesday, though significantly weakened.\nWhile most winter storms in Europe typically reach their peak intensity over the Atlantic Ocean, Christian gained in intensity while crossing Britain, caused by the shape of the jet stream. It reached its peak intensity while crossing northern Germany and Denmark, with southern Denmark recording wind gusts of 194.4 km/h(121 mph), the strongest in the country’s history. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, southern Scandinavia and the Baltic states were also impacted.\nStorm Christian caused widespread transport disruption in all affected countries as rail lines were blocked by fallen trees, airports cancelled flights and harbours delayed shipping traffic. 270,000 homes in Britain and 75,000 in France temporarily lost power. The northern German city of Hamburg recorded a storm surge as the wind gusts drove water upstream the Elbe river. Flooding was very limited, however, as water levels reached only slightly above the barriers. At least 14 fatalities have been reported so far, mainly due to falling trees.\nMost of the damage is expected to have been caused by the wind gusts as flying debris and falling trees damaged homes and cars. As buildings in the affected areas are primarily of masonry construction, most of the damage was limited to rooftops and chimneys, but the storm affected a very large area.\nIt is very early to produce industry loss estimates for Christian, hence the wide range published by Credit Suisse and there is likely to be some movement as the true extent of damage and resulting claims becomes clearer in the coming weeks. Two days ago reinsurance broker Willis Re estimated insured losses of £300m to £500m(approximately €350m to €580m)  in the UK alone, which would appear to be reasonably aligned with Credit Suisse’s estimate for insured losses across Europe.\nCredit Suisse explained how it came to its estimate of insurance industry losses from European windstorm Christian:\nTo derive a first industry loss estimate, we have used a proprietary Europe wind tool which allows us to source near-real time wind data, apply it to insurance exposure and calculate the insured industry loss by zone, country and line of business. We also factored in the fact that this storm is relatively early in the season and so has a larger effect on trees(due to leaves still being on the trees), which leads to slightly higher losses due to wind than if it had occurred in January or February. In addition, the model factors in the flood component as a result of rain. The model has not only enabled us to derive first post-event estimates but also to produce forecasts ahead of the event. Nevertheless, we point out that such events are complex in nature and any estimates are subject to uncertainty.\nCredit Suisse explained that based on the range of insured losses in its estimate and the modelled portfolio impact it does not expect any impact to the low volatility plus fund. The storm may have the potential to create losses for some higher-risk fund strategies that the manager runs, such as its IRIS Enhanced fund, but it will likely require an official estimate to be released by the likes of PERILS AG before that is fully understood.\nIt is looking increasingly likely that ILS investors and third-party reinsurance capital providers will face some level of losses from windstorm Christian, particularly if the insured loss is above $2 billion where it will likely begin to erode layers in some reinsurance programmes which may have collateralized participation. There could also be some low attaching industry loss warranties(ILW’s) with exposure, but we can’t be sure of this.\nWith losses in the range estimated by Credit Suisse it remains unlikely that any 144A catastrophe bonds covering European windstorm risks will be impacted. The industry loss would likely need to be higher before any cat bonds are threatened according to sources, but again this will become clear in the coming weeks as more information on the extent of losses emerges.\nWe’ll continue to update you as new reports regarding European windstorm Christian are published.\nRead our past coverage of European windstorm Christian:\n– Willis Re: UK insured losses from windstorm Christian £300m to £500m\n– Plenum: No impact expected to cat bonds from European windstorm Christian\n– PERILS to assess European windstorm Christian loss potential\n– European windstorm Christian threatens UK and northern Europe\n---PERILS ups windstorm Christian loss estimate to €1.091B---\nPERILS AG, the Zurich-based provider of industry-wide European catastrophe insurance exposure, industry loss data and indices, has announced a third and updated loss estimate of €1.091 billion for insured property losses from October’s European windstorm Christian.\nPERILS issued its first estimate of industry wide insured property losses caused by European windstorm Christian in December, putting the initial estimate at €994m. In line with PERILS reporting procedures, additional data was gathered on the storm and its insured losses and at the next update in late January PERILS increased its estimate by 7.4% to €1.068 billion.\nNow, at the third update of the estimated property insured losses from windstorm Christian(also known as the St Jude storm), PERILS has added another 2.1%, lifting the total estimate of insured market property losses to €1.091 billion.\nWindstorm Christian struck western and northern Europe from 27th to 29th October, causing widespread damage across a number of countries. It was the first of a series of strong and damaging windstorms to hit Europe during the winter season.\nIn line with PERILS reporting procedures, the market loss data from this third loss report is available at a higher level of granularity, with losses per CRESTA zone(two-digit postcode level) and per property line of business.\nBy providing this level of detail, in combination with gust speed data and PERILS market sums insured both available per CRESTA zone and per property line of business, PERILS believe that the R&D value of the Christian loss footprint is greatly enhanced as it can be used to validate European wind risk models with actual data.\nLuzi Hitz, CEO of PERILS, commented on the estimate update; \"PERILS represents an international effort by the insurance industry to add transparency and increase data availability in the Cat risk market. Our detailed loss data for windstorm Christian is a prime example of these efforts and will contribute to a better understanding of insured Cat risk,\"\nEduard Held, Head of Products, said; \"Being able to compare modeled losses and modeled wind vulnerabilities with real CRESTA level data for a Pan-European windstorm event is unique and of significant value to the industry. Having high-resolution industry loss and exposure data is a prerequisite for improving the accuracy of European storm risk assessment.\"\nWindstorm Christian(27 to 29 October 2013), market-wide insured property losses\nPERILS AG explained:\nChristian occurred from 27 to 29 October 2013. It moved rapidly from the south of the United Kingdom in a north-easterly direction over the North Sea into Scandinavia. On its path, the storm caused significant losses in the United Kingdom, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Sweden.\nPERILS reporting schedule deems that the fourth loss estimate will be provided a year after the date of the event, on 27th October 2014.\nUpdate on all events investigated by PERILS AG from this winter:\n---2013 global catastrophe insured losses well below average: Guy Carpenter---\n2013 gave the reinsurance industry a respite, following two above-average years of losses in 2011 and 2012. Insured losses in 2013 from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters are estimated at around $40 billion, according to reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter.\nGuy Carpenter has published its 2013 Catastrophe Review, which looks at the trends in natural catastrophes and man-made disasters during 2013 and how these impacted the insurance and reinsurance industry. The insured loss total in 2013 was well below the 10-year average of around $60 billion, according to Guy Carpenter.\n\"Last year will likely be known as the ‘year of the flood,’ with significant global flood events affecting Central Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States,\" commented Julian Alovisi, Vice President for Guy Carpenter. \"Although 2013 was relatively quiet compared to past years, several major events such as the tornado outbreaks in the U.S., floods, hail and windstorms in Europe and Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines inflicted widespread devastation and significant losses on impact.\"\nWhile insured losses were low in 2013 the graph below, taken from Guy Carpenter’s report, clearly shows the rising trend in global disaster losses. The 10 year moving average has been steadily rising each year, the peaks have got higher and even the lower years would have been near record losses only 15 years ago.\nGlobal catastrophe insured losses 1970 - 2013\nThe U.S. continued to be the leading source of catastrophe insured losses in 2013, but was closely followed by Europe where flooding and hail storm impacts caused major insured losses. Asia’s contribution to global losses continues to grow and this slice of the chart is expected to be the one which widens fastest in years to come. Conspicuously absent is Africa, reflecting the low-level of insurance penetration on that continent.\nDistribution of catastrophe insured losses in 2013 - Source: Guy Carpenter\nGuy Carpenter details some of the key natural catastrophe loss events by region.\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\nCentral Europe experienced the worst flood event of 2013. Persistent heavy rain caused major rivers to overflow their banks and in some cases, flood defenses were breached. Germany in particular was badly affected as the floods inundated countless homes, businesses and crop fields. Estimated insurance losses from this event were approximately $4.1 billion, with economic losses of about $18 billion.\nTo further compound the devastation, the flooding was followed by a series of hail events in late July. In particular, Hailstorm Andreas damaged approximately 100,000 properties and 50,000 cars in the northern and southern regions of the country. This event became one of the costliest natural disasters to hit Germany, with estimated insured losses of $3.7 billion. A series of severe windstorms in Northern Europe also caused significant damage in the autumn and early winter months, with insured losses from Windstorms Christian and Xaver totaling approximately $1.4 billion and $925 million, respectively.\nIn 2014, soil saturation will be a major concern for many areas of Europe, further amplifying the risk of flood during normally wet months.\nAsia/Australasia\nIn 2013, Asia and Australasia were impacted by both natural and man-made catastrophes. The most costly man-made event occurred in China after a major fire hit a large microchip factory in September. Reports estimated that the cost to the(re)insurance sector totaled $1.3 billion, making it the most expensive single-risk loss of 2013. The region was also hit by a number of natural catastrophes in 2013, the first of which occurred in Australia in the form of severe flooding. This event incurred insured losses of approximately $1 billion, according to the Insurance Council of Australia.\nMeanwhile, in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, there were 29 named storms, 16 typhoons and seven super typhoons, with an explosive increase in tropical cyclone activity in the mid-to-late-autumn months. November’s Super Typhoon Haiyan was possibly the most powerful landfalling tropical cyclone on record. Haiyan tragically inflicted over 7,000 fatalities and severe damage to the Philippines due to extreme winds and storm surge. The super typhoon incurred insured losses of $1.5 billion, according to the Philippine Insurers and Reinsurers Association, with a total loss of approximately $10 billion.\nAmericas\nThe Americas were also impacted by flooding in 2013, with notable events occurring in Alberta, Toronto and Colorado. In the Calgary, Alberta region of Canada, flooding caused an estimated $2 billion in insured losses, with economic losses of $4.8 billion. This flood event, coupled with flash flooding in Toronto, Ontario in July, meant Canada experienced its most expensive insured catastrophe loss year on record.\nDespite the relatively quiet tornado season in the United States, there were a handful of severe thunderstorm outbreaks. Most notable was the outbreak in May that affected the Southeast, Midwest and Southern Plains. This outbreak spurred the devastating Moore, Oklahoma tornado which caused insured losses of approximately $1.8 billion. Another burst struck shortly after the Moore event, affecting the Midwest and Southern Plains and included the El Reno tornado, which incurred insured losses of $1.4 billion.\n\"Heading deeper into 2014, we are very concerned about the water situation in the state of California,\" James Waller, PhD, Research Meteorologist for GC Analytics®. \"In 2013, California experienced the lowest precipitation in recorded history for the state. This has already led to exceptionally severe drought conditions in the area. If these conditions continue to persist, lasting and significant impacts to water resources, agriculture and an aggressive wildfire season will be major areas of concern.\"\n2013 Hurricane Season\nThe 2013 Atlantic Hurricane season was one of the most inactive on record. The most noteworthy events of the 2013 hurricane season were the landfalls of Hurricane Ingrid(Atlantic) and Tropical Storm Manuel(Pacific) in Mexico in September. These storms caused excessive rainfall, flooding and mudslides, causing thousands to be displaced. The combined estimated insured losses for these events totaled $920 million, according to the Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions.\nOnly five other seasons since 1970 had less activity than 2013 in the Atlantic basin. The quiet season was in part due to persistent dry, stable air over large portions of the Atlantic main development region. The inactive season was unexpected given statistical forecasts for above-average activity provided by seasonal outlook providers. There is, however, no guarantee that the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season will be like the 2013 season.\nDownload the full report from Guy Carpenter in PDF format.\n---PERILS puts initial loss estimate for windstorm Christian at €994m---\nZurich based PERILS AG, an independent provider of industry-wide European catastrophe insurance exposure, industry loss data and indices, has released its first estimate of industry wide insured property losses for October’s European windstorm Christian.\nWindstorm Christian struck western and northern Europe from 27th to 29th October, causing widespread damage across a number of countries. The storm was named Christian by the Free University of Berlin, but St. Jude in the UK, Simone in Sweden and Oktoberstormen in Denmark.\nPERILS’ initial estimate for the insured property market loss from European windstorm Christian is €994m($1.35 billion or £830m). It said that the majority of the insured loss has occurred in Denmark, Germany and The Netherlands, with some losses also occurring in Belgium, Sweden and the UK.\nEuropean Windstorm Christian, maximum gust values in km/h - Source: PERILS AG\nPERILS’ estimate of market-wide insured property losses is based on ultimate gross loss data reported to it by primary insurers and excludes losses indemnified by any government schemes. PERILS only reports on losses of €250m and above, it told Artemis on the 28th October that it would investigate Christian as a potential PERILS reported event.\nLuzi Hitz, CEO of PERILS, commented: \"The main characteristics of windstorm Christian were its early occurrence date in the European winterstorm season and the rapid speed with which the low pressure system travelled over the affected markets. Gust speeds were particularly high in the northern parts of The Netherlands and Germany, as well as in Denmark.\"\nEdi Held, Head of Sales & Products, added: \"The loss and gust data relating to Christian, combined with the exposure data we have gathered for the markets affected, serves to further increase the value of the PERILS industry exposure and loss database, enhancing the ability of users to improve their understanding of the risk of European winter storms.\"\nIn line with its typical reporting schedule, PERILS will provide its next update on the insured loss from European windstorm Christian by the 27th January 2014, three months after the event start date.\nOther insurance industry loss estimates for European windstorm Christian:\n– AIR: European windstorm Christian insured losses €1.5 billion to €2.3 billion\n– Willis Re: Europe-wide windstorm Christian insured loss €800m to €1.3 billion\n– Windstorm Christian insured losses $1.7bn to $2.9bn estimates Credit Suisse\n– Willis Re: UK insured losses from windstorm Christian £300m to £500m\n---Insured losses from 2013 German catastrophes near $9.6 billion---\nGerman insurers are set to pay out €7 billion, which is approximately $9.6 billion, as a result of the weather catastrophes which struck the region in 2013, which the Association of German Insurers(GDV) has termed an exceptional year.\n\"The accumulation of various weather extremes within a few months made ​​2013 an exceptional year,\" commented Alexander Erdland, President of the General Association of German Insurers(GDV).\nInsurers responded to more than 2 million claims in just a few months, which Erdland called a ‘gigantic task’, but one which insurers responded to well and the majority of claims are already settled.\n€5.5 billion($7.5 billion) of the claims paid relate to property insurance, with €1.8 billion from the June flooding, €3.1 billion from hailstorms from summer to early autumn, between €300m and €400m from European windstorm Christian in October and between €100m and €200m from European windstorm Xaver in December.\nAnother €1.5 billion(over $2 billion) is attributed to motor claims from the June floods, hailstorms and European windstorms.\nThe GDV said that 2013 was not an exception and that comparable years of losses have been seen in the past. The last comparable years were in 1990 and in 2002. However losses are expected to rise as frequency of catastrophic weather events increases, with storm and hail damage expected to increase by 50% to 60% by 2050.\nGermany has suffered not far off one-quarter of the global insured natural disaster losses based on these figures and Swiss Re’s early estimate of the annual total for 2013. That is quite unusual but shows the importance of the reinsurance market to German insurers.\nIt’s no surprise that at least one collateralized reinsurance and ILS fund suffered some losses from the German events this year, according to our sources. The hail events in particular caused a small loss on one exposed fund which had participated in a major German insurers reinsurance program in 2013.\nWith ILS and collateralized reinsurance funds expected to grow their involvement in European markets, in fact renewal commentary said that this was noticed during the January reinsurance renewals, we should expect to see more losses trickling into the ILS market from natural catastrophe and weather events in Germany and other European nations in years to come.\nInterestingly, these figures from the German insurance association appear at odds with early estimates of natural catastrophe insured losses from reinsurers Swiss Re and Munich Re. The figures from the GDV would suggest that both reinsurance firms early estimates of 2013 natural catastrophe losses, $31 billion globally according to Munich Re and $38 billion of global losses from Swiss Re, look a little on the light side.\n---Losses mount in worst European winter storm season since 1990---\nThe winter storm season in Europe looks set to add additional pressure to any insurers and reinsurers that are already feeling the pinch due to declining property catastrophe renewal rates, as losses from European windstorm and flooding start to mount.\nBoth sides of the Atlantic are experiencing unusually severe winter storm season, with the U.S. seeing extreme cold, heavy snowfalls and ice storms, after which the low pressure systems have been racing across the Atlantic and intensifying on the way to Europe.\nThe result is that Europe is currently experiencing the most severe winter storm season since 1990, according to risk modelling firm RMS, with a number of European windstorms causing insured losses and the rainfall from these storms, added to a very wet winter, now causing significant flooding, particularly across the UK and Ireland.\nRobert Muir-Wood, chief research officer at RMS, commented; \"This winter storm season has seen the most severe sequence of storms since 1990.\"\nIn December Europe saw two severe windstorms, Xaver and Dirk, which Impact Forecasting, the catastrophe modelling unit at reinsurance broker Aon Benfield, said would result in combined economic losses of at least $2.25 billion.\nImpact Forecasting put the insured loss from the two storms at approximately $1.6 billion, with $1.1 billion caused by windstorm Xaver and $500m caused by windstorm Dirk.\nAs a reminder, this is on top of the insured losses from European windstorm Christian from October, which PERILS AG estimated at around $1.35 billion.\nAdam Podlaha, Head of Impact Forecasting, said; \"The clustered pattern of windstorms seen across western and northern Europe in December has emphasized the importance of being able to capture this phenomenon in catastrophe models. Impact Forecasting’s new European windstorm model replicates such clustering patterns by using a realistic sequence of storms originating directly from highly advanced global climate models.\"\nEurope has been hit by multiple European windstorms in recent weeks, not just Dirk and Xaver, showing that there has been no let up in the weather this winter. The latest, named windstorm Christina, has affected the UK and Ireland as well as northern France and some areas of Scandinavia in recent days as well.\nThe result of the repeated windstorm impacts on Europe is that the ground is saturated and flooding has become severe, particularly in Ireland and the UK. Record high tides and tidal surges coinciding with Spring tides have exacerbated the situation and caused coastal damage and flooding.\nRMS said; \"Since the peak of the 2013 / 2014 winter storm season started in December, Northern Europe has been bombarded by 14 low-pressure systems. These weather systems have swept in off the North Atlantic and brought strong wind gusts in excess of 90 mph in remote locations and gusts over 70 mph over large parts of the UK. Extreme rainfall levels have been observed across the country, particularly in Scotland where one location observed 73.6 mm of rain on Christmas Eve. The significant precipitation contributed to December seeing 154 per cent of the UK historical average rainfall for that month and in Scotland it was the wettest December since records began in 1910.\"\nThe position of the jet stream, very different to last year when the UK had cold polar air, is the main factor bringing the repeated storms to Europe’s shores, as is the prevalence of winter storms in the U.S., remnants of which are fed into the jet stream and propelled east.\nRMS explained; \"The succession of large and intense low pressure weather systems has been a function of a very strong and stable jet stream, fed by the strong contrast between the warm tropical Atlantic air masses and intensely cold Arctic air over North America. Although this sequence cannot be directly linked with climate change – the coastal flooding will be more common in the future, while winter rainfall totals are expected to rise.\"\nInsured losses in Ireland are expected to be close to the highs seen from flooding in 2009, when insurers shouldered approximately $340m of losses. An official estimate is expected from Insurance Ireland in three to four weeks.\nMohammad Khan, an insurance partner at PwC, commented on the impact of the UK flooding on the insurance sector, saying that the events could result in hundreds of millions of pounds of losses.\n\"The impact of the extreme rain and floods of recent months has become progressively worse. For the UK insurance industry, although this may not be the final estimate of the full costs of all the weather we have had, indications are that this could leave the industry up to £400m out of pocket. This estimate could develop further, particularly given the further flood warnings in place in the UK this week. Although the impact on individuals and businesses over Christmas has been severe, the 1,800 properties impacted so far does not compare to the 2007 storms where approximately 55,000 homes and business’ were adversely impacted.\"\n\"When including uninsured losses, the full economic cost of the floods will be slightly above the insured cost of £400m. However, unlike in many parts of Europe, weather, flood and storm events are covered by personal and commercial property insurance as a default option rather than being a potential add-on. This has meant that many individuals over the holiday season have been able to gain assistance from their insurers in ensuring the necessary repairs to their property.\"\n\"Despite the weather in the last three months of the year, 2013 has still been one of the most benign weather years in terms of insured losses. For many insurers who announce their year-end results next week, we expect results for those writing personal and commercial property lines to have positive results. Those insurers that have done most to understand the potential for flood, storm and weather events will have benefitted from this investment given the events of the last two to three months.\"\nBack across the Atlantic, U.S. winter storms in December are expected to result in insured losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. With the weather having worsened considerably into January as well, due to record low temperatures and snowfall caused by the polar vortex phenomenon, U.S. winter storm losses are likely to be high and we will update you when details of the impact to insurers and reinsurers are clearer.\nThe European windstorm and winter storm season has some months left to run, typically until April storms can threaten. Also the flooding event is still developing in the UK and Ireland, with more rainfall expected in the coming days, rivers already swollen and flood defences likely to be breached again.\nAdded to the mounting losses in the United States and Canada from winter storms, ice storms and snowfall disruption, the worst European winter storm season in years will bring unwelcome losses to insurers. No single event currently looks set to trouble the sector, but on an aggregate basis, including European storms since October, the flooding and the U.S. winter storms, the impact is set to be passed on, at least to some degree, to the global reinsurers who protect the primaries.\nHow big that impact will be is impossible to tell, but some impact is sure to hit the reinsurance sector given the amount of events and mounting aggregate losses of this winter storm period. Some impact is possible to collateralized reinsurers and ILS managers who participate in major European reinsurance programs. We will keep you updated as loss estimates emerge and the impact becomes clearer. related to Christian|St. Jude|Simone|Oktoberstormen,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Christian|St. Jude|Simone|Oktoberstormen, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
