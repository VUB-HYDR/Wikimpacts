PERILS initial estimate for windstorm Dirk is for an insured property market loss of €275m(approx $375m or £230m).\nPERILS AG is a Zurich based provider of industry-wide European catastrophe insurance exposure, industry loss data and indices. The firm has been kept particularly busy in the current European windstorm season, with so many low pressure systems developing to a level that causes meaningful property insurance market losses.\nWindstorm Dirk struck northern Europe, predominantly affecting the UK and France, from the 23rd to the 25th December. The majority of these losses are from southern England in the UK as well as Brittany and Normandy in France, according to PERILS.\nPERILS’ first insured market loss estimate is based on ultimate gross loss data reported to it by primary insurance companies but excludes any losses indemnified by government catastrophe insurance schemes, such as France’s ‘CatNat’.\nAs is typical with PERILS reporting schedule, it will provide an updated estimate of the insurance market loss from windstorm Dirk by the 23rd March 2014, three months after the event start date.\nEuropean Windstorm Dirk, maximum gust values in km/h - Source: PERILS AG\nPERILS explained:\nThe Dirk depression formed over Newfoundland on 22 December 2013. It reached Western Europe on 23 December, where the first strong gusts were recorded in Ireland that afternoon. On Christmas Eve, the system reached its minimum pressure over land with a recorded 937mb at Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, off the north-west coast of Scotland.\nThis was the lowest recorded value in the British Isles since 1886. From there, the system slowly moved in a north-easterly direction towards northern Norway. Gradually the depression began to fill, before finally dissipating on 27 December.\nThe highest wind speeds occurred in the UK and in France where storm surge and heavy precipitation accompanying the storm led to localized flooding.\n---PERILS: Windstorm Tini initial loss estimate €245m, Dirk upped to €352m---\nPERILS AG, the provider of industry-wide European catastrophe insurance exposure, data and indices, has announced a first estimate of insured property losses for European windstorm Tini of €245m and an updated loss estimate for windstorm Dirk of €352m.\nWindstorm Tini, also known as Darwin, impacted the UK and Ireland on 12th and 13th February 2014, with the majority of the losses occurring in those two countries. PERILS’ initial estimate of the insured property market loss for Tini is €245m, which is approximately $340m or £205m, based on ultimate gross loss data as reported by primary insurance companies.\nIn line with PERILS reporting schedule an updated estimate of the insured market loss caused by windstorm Tini will be made available by 12th May 2014, three months after the event start date.\nPERILS AG explained:\nOn 12 and 13 February 2014, an extra-tropical cyclone named Tini caused significant damage across Ireland and the UK. Tini was one of a series of storms that impacted this region during the winter of 2013/2014. Strong winds affected large parts of Ireland, with peak gusts of well over 100km/h reported across most of the country. The highest gust of 159km/h was recorded at Shannon Airport. The highest gust experienced in the UK was 180km/h registered at Great Dun Fell in England’s Pennine mountain range(848m a.s.l.).\nEuropean windstorm Dirk\nIn the announcement published this morning PERILS AG has also provided its second updated industry loss estimate for European windstorm Dirk which struck the UK and France from 23rd December to 25th December 2013. PERILS initial loss estimate for Dirk was €275m, but this has now been increased to €352m, which is approximately $485m or £295m. The estimate excludes losses indemnified by government schemes such as CatNat in France.\nIn line with PERILS typical loss reporting schedule, the third loss estimate for windstorm Dirk will be published on 23rd June 2014.\nUK floods\nPERILS also announced today that it will not report on the recent UK flood events. The flooding, while severe and causing heavy insurance industry losses, do not qualify as an event that PERILS will capture and report on. PERILS explained; \"Having applied prevailing reinsurance event definitions(with hours clauses of 168h or 504h), no eligible time period could be identified during which the floods caused a market-wide insured property damage exceeding the PERILS capturing threshold of EUR 200m per event.\"\nPERILS reports on catastrophe events for the reinsurance industry so only on events which would qualify under the terms of prevailing reinsurance contract definitions of events. Despite the severe nature of the UK floods they losses are spread over a long period of time meaning that it will not be reported on.\nUpdate on all events investigated by PERILS AG from this winter\n---PERILS increases loss estimate for European windstorm Dirk to €370m---\nPERILS AG, the Swiss-based provider of industry-wide European catastrophe insurance industry loss data and indices, has disclosed an updated third industry-wide insured loss estimate for European windstorm Dirk, raising the figure to €370m.\nWindstorm Dirk struck northern Europe, predominantly affecting the UK and France, from the 23rd to the 25th December. The majority of the losses reported by PERILS are from southern England in the UK as well as Brittany and Normandy in France.\nPERILS initial loss estimate for Dirk, reported in February, was €275m. The estimate was increased to €352m in late March and this morning PERILS has released its third estimate, increasing the industry loss total to €370m, which is approximately $505m or £296m.\nBeing the third scheduled loss estimate, the data on windstorm Dirk is now available at a more granular level. The market loss data is available at a higher level of granularity, with losses per CRESTA zone(two-digit postcode level) and per property line of business.\nThe granularity of the data now available to PERILS subscribers means that in combination with gust speed data and PERILS market sums insured, the windstorm Dirk loss footprint can be used to validate European wind risk models with actual data.\nIn line with PERILS reporting schedule the fourth loss estimate for European windstorm Dirk will be made available on the 23rd December 2014.\nMap of European windstorm Dirk loss estimate:\nEuropean windstorm Dirk map of loss estimate - Source: PERILS AG\nUpdate on all European catastrophe events investigated by PERILS AG from this winter:\n---PERILS investigates Dirk, third major European windstorm of season---\nZurich based independent provider of industry wide Euro catastrophe insurance loss data and indices to reinsurers and ILS specialists, PERILS AG, has added Dirk to its list of European windstorms to investigate, taking the tally to three so far this season.\nWhen PERILS places a catastrophe event ‘under investigation’ it means that the event has the potential to result in a market-wide insured industry property loss exceeding €200m. PERILS makes an initial investigation of a storm’s potential to cause a sufficiently large insurance industry loss as the first step in its process. If it becomes apparent that the storm will likely cause a €200m market-wide loss then it will be reported on, based on information PERILS receives from data providing insurance companies.\nEuropean windstorm Dirk struck the UK, France and Spain on the 24th December, bringing winds gusting to near 100mph and significant rainfall. In the UK this rainfall led to a number of major flooding incidents, some of which were in population centres where there was a considerable amount of damage caused.\nThis takes the number of European windstorms investigated by PERILS AG this season to three already. It is very early in the season for this number of major storms to have occurred, compared to recent years, but the number could rise even further. Another storm, named Erich, has been impacting Ireland, the western and northwest UK today, again bringing strong winds and more heavy rainfall. At the moment Erich does not look to have caused sufficient impact to be investigated by PERILS.\nThe 2013/14 European windstorm season is beginning to look like one of the most active in a while. So far none of the events are thought to have been sufficiently damaging to impact any European windstorm catastrophe bonds, but as losses accumulate from a number of damaging storms the impact is almost certain to trickle down to reinsurers. Once losses impact reinsurers we may begin to see some losses being paid from within the ILS fund space where a number of managers participate in major European reinsurance programs on a collateralized basis.\nPERILS is already reporting on European windstorm Christian, which it has published a first loss estimate for. Also under investigation is European windstorm Xaver.\nDirk caused at least 750,000 power outages across the European countries it impacted, according to Aon Benfield’s Impact Forecasting unit, as well as resulting in at least six deaths.\nThe update from Impact Forecasting said:\nPrior to Dirk’s arrival, the UK Met Office issued 162 severe flood warnings and 276 flood alerts across England and Wales as heavy rains forced river levels to swell. More than 1,000 homes were flooded in southern England following multiple rivers overflowing their banks(including the Medway, Mole, Stour, and Severan rivers). The Environment Agency cited the floods in Kent and Sussex as the worst since 2000, while Leatherhead and Dorking also reported heavy flooding. Wind damage was prevalent in the UK as well, with winds gusting beyond 130 kph(80 mph) downing a large volume of trees and power lines. Britain’s Energy Networks Association reported that more than 420,000 power outages occurred at the height of the event. Five people were killed in the UK.\nElsewhere, one person was killed in France as winds gusted up to 150 kph(90 mph) along coastal locations. More than 240,000 power outages occurred, with most registered in the Brittany and Normandy regions. At the peak, Meteo France issued \"Orange\" level weather alerts for at least 23 of the country’s 96 departments. Excessive rains prompted rivers to swell as hundreds of properties were inundated. In Spain, nearly 90,000 customers lost electricity in Spanish Galicia due to high winds. Additional damage was cited in Poland and parts of Scandinavia.\nBeyond property damage, Dirk was responsible for significant travel delays and cancellations throughout Europe. Travel via rail, ferry and air was all disrupted during the peak of holiday travel on December 24. England’s Network Rail reported that its infrastructure damage was worse during Kirk than WS Christian.\nAon Benfield said initial reports from Europe suggest that the financial impact from European windstorm Dirk will be lower than that caused by Christian and Xaver.\n---Losses mount in worst European winter storm season since 1990---\nThe winter storm season in Europe looks set to add additional pressure to any insurers and reinsurers that are already feeling the pinch due to declining property catastrophe renewal rates, as losses from European windstorm and flooding start to mount.\nBoth sides of the Atlantic are experiencing unusually severe winter storm season, with the U.S. seeing extreme cold, heavy snowfalls and ice storms, after which the low pressure systems have been racing across the Atlantic and intensifying on the way to Europe.\nThe result is that Europe is currently experiencing the most severe winter storm season since 1990, according to risk modelling firm RMS, with a number of European windstorms causing insured losses and the rainfall from these storms, added to a very wet winter, now causing significant flooding, particularly across the UK and Ireland.\nRobert Muir-Wood, chief research officer at RMS, commented; \"This winter storm season has seen the most severe sequence of storms since 1990.\"\nIn December Europe saw two severe windstorms, Xaver and Dirk, which Impact Forecasting, the catastrophe modelling unit at reinsurance broker Aon Benfield, said would result in combined economic losses of at least $2.25 billion.\nImpact Forecasting put the insured loss from the two storms at approximately $1.6 billion, with $1.1 billion caused by windstorm Xaver and $500m caused by windstorm Dirk.\nAs a reminder, this is on top of the insured losses from European windstorm Christian from October, which PERILS AG estimated at around $1.35 billion.\nAdam Podlaha, Head of Impact Forecasting, said; \"The clustered pattern of windstorms seen across western and northern Europe in December has emphasized the importance of being able to capture this phenomenon in catastrophe models. Impact Forecasting’s new European windstorm model replicates such clustering patterns by using a realistic sequence of storms originating directly from highly advanced global climate models.\"\nEurope has been hit by multiple European windstorms in recent weeks, not just Dirk and Xaver, showing that there has been no let up in the weather this winter. The latest, named windstorm Christina, has affected the UK and Ireland as well as northern France and some areas of Scandinavia in recent days as well.\nThe result of the repeated windstorm impacts on Europe is that the ground is saturated and flooding has become severe, particularly in Ireland and the UK. Record high tides and tidal surges coinciding with Spring tides have exacerbated the situation and caused coastal damage and flooding.\nRMS said; \"Since the peak of the 2013 / 2014 winter storm season started in December, Northern Europe has been bombarded by 14 low-pressure systems. These weather systems have swept in off the North Atlantic and brought strong wind gusts in excess of 90 mph in remote locations and gusts over 70 mph over large parts of the UK. Extreme rainfall levels have been observed across the country, particularly in Scotland where one location observed 73.6 mm of rain on Christmas Eve. The significant precipitation contributed to December seeing 154 per cent of the UK historical average rainfall for that month and in Scotland it was the wettest December since records began in 1910.\"\nThe position of the jet stream, very different to last year when the UK had cold polar air, is the main factor bringing the repeated storms to Europe’s shores, as is the prevalence of winter storms in the U.S., remnants of which are fed into the jet stream and propelled east.\nRMS explained; \"The succession of large and intense low pressure weather systems has been a function of a very strong and stable jet stream, fed by the strong contrast between the warm tropical Atlantic air masses and intensely cold Arctic air over North America. Although this sequence cannot be directly linked with climate change – the coastal flooding will be more common in the future, while winter rainfall totals are expected to rise.\"\nInsured losses in Ireland are expected to be close to the highs seen from flooding in 2009, when insurers shouldered approximately $340m of losses. An official estimate is expected from Insurance Ireland in three to four weeks.\nMohammad Khan, an insurance partner at PwC, commented on the impact of the UK flooding on the insurance sector, saying that the events could result in hundreds of millions of pounds of losses.\n\"The impact of the extreme rain and floods of recent months has become progressively worse. For the UK insurance industry, although this may not be the final estimate of the full costs of all the weather we have had, indications are that this could leave the industry up to £400m out of pocket. This estimate could develop further, particularly given the further flood warnings in place in the UK this week. Although the impact on individuals and businesses over Christmas has been severe, the 1,800 properties impacted so far does not compare to the 2007 storms where approximately 55,000 homes and business’ were adversely impacted.\"\n\"When including uninsured losses, the full economic cost of the floods will be slightly above the insured cost of £400m. However, unlike in many parts of Europe, weather, flood and storm events are covered by personal and commercial property insurance as a default option rather than being a potential add-on. This has meant that many individuals over the holiday season have been able to gain assistance from their insurers in ensuring the necessary repairs to their property.\"\n\"Despite the weather in the last three months of the year, 2013 has still been one of the most benign weather years in terms of insured losses. For many insurers who announce their year-end results next week, we expect results for those writing personal and commercial property lines to have positive results. Those insurers that have done most to understand the potential for flood, storm and weather events will have benefitted from this investment given the events of the last two to three months.\"\nBack across the Atlantic, U.S. winter storms in December are expected to result in insured losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. With the weather having worsened considerably into January as well, due to record low temperatures and snowfall caused by the polar vortex phenomenon, U.S. winter storm losses are likely to be high and we will update you when details of the impact to insurers and reinsurers are clearer.\nThe European windstorm and winter storm season has some months left to run, typically until April storms can threaten. Also the flooding event is still developing in the UK and Ireland, with more rainfall expected in the coming days, rivers already swollen and flood defences likely to be breached again.\nAdded to the mounting losses in the United States and Canada from winter storms, ice storms and snowfall disruption, the worst European winter storm season in years will bring unwelcome losses to insurers. No single event currently looks set to trouble the sector, but on an aggregate basis, including European storms since October, the flooding and the U.S. winter storms, the impact is set to be passed on, at least to some degree, to the global reinsurers who protect the primaries.\nHow big that impact will be is impossible to tell, but some impact is sure to hit the reinsurance sector given the amount of events and mounting aggregate losses of this winter storm period. Some impact is possible to collateralized reinsurers and ILS managers who participate in major European reinsurance programs. We will keep you updated as loss estimates emerge and the impact becomes clearer. related to Dirk,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Dirk, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
