In June, PERILS raised its estimate by 8% to EUR 798 million, before announcing a slight reduction to EUR 772 million in September.\nNow, in its final insurance and reinsurance industry loss estimate for these two low pressure systems, PERILS has announced a slight increase of 1.3% to EUR 782 million.\nPERILS final insured property market loss report, which is released 12 months after the event, is based on loss data collected from affected insurers and is made available by CRESTA zone property line of business for all affected countries.\nDragi, the weaker of the two low pressure system storms that tracked towards Europe hit first on March 9th, followed the next day by Eberhard. Both storms impacted similar areas, mainly affecting parts of Belgium, France, Northern Germany, Poland and northern parts of the Czech Republic.\nPERILS notes that the resulting industry loss represented the largest windstorm loss of the 2018/2019 European extratropical cyclone season.\nInitially, loss estimates for these two events had been higher, with AIR Worldwide suggesting a modelled loss estimate of up to EUR 1.5 billion, and actuaries estimating that Eberhard had caused EUR 600 million of property damage in Germany alone.\nUltimately, the final industry loss estimate from PERILS is some way off where the market had initially assumed the loss would lie. This will likely be welcomed news to some insurance and reinsurance markets in light of original estimates and despite these two storms being the largest in a fairly benign European winter storms season.\n---PERILS pegs combined loss of storms Draghi & Eberhard at EUR 740m---\nPERILS AG, the industry loss data provider, has estimated the insurance and reinsurance market property loss from European windstorms Draghi and Eberhard at just EUR 740 million.\nThe estimate for these two low pressure systems seems perhaps low, as storm Eberhard alone had a modelled loss estimate of up to EUR 1.5 billion from AIR Worldwide, while Eberhard was estimated to have caused as much as EUR 600 million of insured property damage in Germany alone by actuaries.\nHowever, differences in methodologies and early estimates versus collected loss data, will account for any differences.\nThe market had been largely expecting an industry impact of around EUR 1 billion from storm Eberhard we understand, hence PERILS aggregated estimate using claims data collected from re/insurers could draw a sigh of relief from some that had been fearing the storms potential to eat into some reinsurance layers.\nDragi was the weaker of the two low pressure storm systems and struck on 9th March 2019, immediately followed by Eberhard on 10th March and affected a similar area across the British Isles, France, the Benelux states, Germany and Switzerland.\nGiven the difficulties in allocation specific insured losses to either named system, PERILS event loss figure combines losses from both events.\nStill, the industry loss from Dragi-Eberhard is the largest in another otherwise benign 2018/2019 European winter storm season.\nThe market has not suffered a really significant European windstorm loss for some years now and this has amplified the pressure on reinsurance pricing in the region, resulting in the very soft market that has proved unattractive to many ILS players.\nPERILS notes that for most of the individual affected countries, the event loss return period was not considered unusual, except for Belgium, where the loss level caused by Dragi-Eberhard is expected to be reached or exceeded once every 10 years.\nPERILS also said today that it will not report on European windstorm Bennet(also known as Freya), as the extratropical cyclone, which affected mainly France, Germany and Switzerland on 4th March 2019, did not exceed the firms reporting threshold of EUR 200m.\nBennet was estimated to have caused around EUR 200 million of property loss in Germany alone by actuaries Meyerthole Siems Kohlruss(MSK).\nIt’s important to note that this is the first estimate for Draghi and Eberhard, so there is the potential for the industry loss total to rise.\n———–\nRegister today to attend our next ILS conference in Singapore, ILS Asia 2019.\nWe’re returning to Singapore for our fourth annual ILS market conference for the Asia region.

Bennet is expected to have caused at least a EUR 200 million insurance and reinsurance market loss.\nIn addition storm Laura/Cornelius affected the UK and Scandinavian countries later that same week, while Dragi affected Northern Europe just prior to Eberhard.\nEuropean wind storm conditions continued this week with Franz/Gareth, as well as Gebhard and Heinz all current named depressions in the northern European region.\nAs a result, the overall insurance and reinsurance market loss from European wind storm conditions over the last fortnight could easily surpass EUR 2 billion, it seems.\nAIR said its industry loss estimate for storm Eberhard includes insured physical damage from wind to property(residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and auto), including structures and their contents, business interruption and additional living expenses(just for the UK). It does not include demand surge, infrastructure losses, coastal or inland flooding losses.\nCurrently PERILS AG, the catastrophe loss data aggregator, has storm Freya / Bennet under investigation, but does not have Eberhard listed on its website so far. Given this estimate size, it seems inevitable that PERILS will collect loss data from insurers and provide reports on this storm.\n---Industry loss from EU storms Dragi & Eberhard raised to EUR 798m by PERILS---\nThe insurance and reinsurance industry loss estimate for the combined market-wide impacts of European windstorms Dragi and Eberhard has been raised by 8% to roughly EUR 798 million(US $900m).\nThis still sits below the market expectation that these two windstorms that struck Europe on March 9th and 10th 2019 would cause a combined impact of over EUR 1 billion, which would be closer to US $1.15 billion.\nThe estimates from industry loss data provider PERILS AG are based on data collected from insurance firms operating in the regions affected.\nPERILS had originally pegged the loss at EUR 740 million with its first estimate back in April.\nDragi had been the weaker of the two low pressure storm systems that tracked towards Europe and struck on 9th March 2019, immediately followed by Eberhard on 10th March, with each affecting a similar area across the British Isles, France, the Benelux states, Germany and Switzerland.\nInitial estimates had suggested a much higher toll from the more powerful storm Eberhard, with a modelled loss estimate suggesting up to EUR 1.5 billion from AIR Worldwide, while Eberhard was also estimated to have caused as much as EUR 600 million of insured property damage in Germany alone by actuaries.\nThat left the market anticipating a billion Euro plus loss from these storms, which could have had the potential to affect certain reinsurance contracts or at least eat into aggregate layer retentions.\nGiven the difficulties in allocating specific insured losses to storm systems that occurred so close together, PERILS loss estimate figure combines the impacts from both events.\nBut still it falls some way short of where the market had assumed this loss would lie, which will be a relief for some insurance and reinsurance markets.\nDespite being smaller than expected, the Dragi-Eberhard insurance market loss is the largest in another otherwise benign 2018/2019 European winter storm season.\nThe European property insurance market has not suffered a really significant European windstorm loss, or other natural catastrophe event, for a number of years now. This has amplified the pressure on reinsurance pricing in the region, resulting in the very soft market that has proved unattractive to many ILS players.\n———–\nRegister today to attend our next ILS conference in Singapore, ILS Asia 2019.\nWe’re returning to Singapore for our fourth annual ILS market conference for the Asia region.
