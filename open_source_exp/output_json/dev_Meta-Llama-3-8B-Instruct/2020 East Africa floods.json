They began when excessive rains began falling in March, leading to massive flooding and landslides. They caused more than 430 deaths, notably in Kenya and Rwanda. In the fall another round of floods hit the African Sahel.\nFloods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas. Disastrous floods have caused millions of fatalities in the twentieth century, tens of billions of dollars of direct economic loss each year, and significant disruption to global trade.\n-Impact by country-\n--Rwanda--\nHeavy rain, lighting and thunderstorms affected the country between 2 and 4 March, causing 5 fatalities, with floods reported in Kigali and Southern provinces.

This was followed by above average rainfall in January and February 2020(dry season). The 2020 Long Rains(March–May) also gave above average rainfall across East Africa - with especially high rainfall totals in March and April 2020. Over Uganda and western Kenya above average rainfall continued throughout June–September.\n\n== References == related to 2020 East Africa floods,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by 2020 East Africa floods, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
