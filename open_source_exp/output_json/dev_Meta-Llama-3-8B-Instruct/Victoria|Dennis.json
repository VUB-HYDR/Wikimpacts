    "prompt": "\n        Based on the provided article, which includes the information box None and the full text \n---Euro windstorm Victoria / Dennis industry loss raised 20% to EUR 344m---\nThe insurance and reinsurance market loss from February 2020’s European windstorm Victoria, also known as storm Dennis in the UK, is estimated to have risen by around 20% to EUR 344 million, according to PERILS AG.\nEuropean windstorm Victoria(Dennis) struck the British Isles and areas of north-western Europe between the 15th and 17th February 2020, coming just six days after windstorm Sabine(Ciara, Elsa) which caused a much larger loss of over EUR 1.6 billion.\nImpacts across the UK, Germany and Belgium drove the majority of the industry loss with wind gusts recorded of up to 100km/h.\nPERILS, the Zurich based aggregator of insurance and reinsurance market loss report data, pegged an initial estimate of the insured property market loss for extratropical cyclone Victoria(Dennis) at EUR 286 million back at the end of March.\nNow, in its first update since, due to an enforced Covid-break from collecting re/insurer data, PERILS has increased its industry loss estimate for the storm by 20% to EUR 344 million.\nPERILS industry loss estimate does not include any damage caused by flooding again, despite the fact Victoria(Dennis) exacerbated the flood situation in the UK at the time.\nHowever, the industry-backed loss data aggregator said that it will be publishing a report on the February 2020 UK floods in the near future.\nEuropean windstorm Victoria was the thirteenth storm of a particularly active extratropical storm season in Europe.\nPERILS explained, \"Victoria originated over the US and initially consisted of multiple low-pressure vortices. It significantly strengthened after an explosive cyclogenesis which included a rapid deepening of its central air pressure to 920mB, one of the lowest values measured over the North Atlantic since records began more than 150 years ago. However, Victoria affected a much smaller area across the British Isles and western Europe than Sabine six days earlier. As a result, losses from Victoria were approximately five times lower but still added to the considerable weather-related claims toll during February 2020.\"\n---Windstorm Victoria – Dennis industry loss said EUR 286m by PERILS---\nEuropean windstorm Victoria, also known as storm Dennis in the UK, is estimated to have cost the insurance market at least EUR 286 million, according to PERILS AG.\nBeing its first estimate for the market-wide property insurance and perhaps reinsurance loss for storm Victoria, there is a good chance PERILS increases it at the next report.\nEuropean windstorm Victoria(Dennis) struck the British Isles and north-western Europe between the 15th and 17th February 2020, coming just six days after windstorm Sabine(Ciara, Elsa) which caused a much larger loss of around EUR 1.6 billion.\nThe UK, Germany and Belgium suffered the majority of the industry loss due to wind gusts of up to 100km/h, PERILS said based on the data collected from re/insurers.\nThe initial estimate for the insured property market loss for extratropical cyclone Victoria(Dennis) is EUR 286 million, which would be too low for most reinsurance layers but in aggregation with other European windstorms of the 2019/20 winter season could drive higher losses for some insurers and perhaps trouble some lower reinsurance covers.\nOnce again, PERILS industry loss estimate does not include any damage caused by flooding, despite the fact Victoria(Dennis) exacerbated the flood situation in the UK at the time.\nVictoria(Dennis) was the thirteenth named storm of a particularly active 2019–20 European windstorm season. Two more storms remain under investigation by PERILS, Hanna(Laura) and Bianca-Charlotte(Jorge), while storm Xanthippe-Yulia is estimated to have caused an industry loss of below EUR 200 million, so will not be reported on.\nPERILS is also investigating the UK floods of February 2020 to identify whether they have caused a sufficient insurance and reinsurance market loss to warrant reporting on.\n---Euro windstorm Victoria / Dennis industry loss finalised at EUR 350m---\nThe insurance and reinsurance market loss from European windstorm Victoria, also known as storm Dennis in the UK, which struck in February 2020, has now been finalised at EUR 350 million, by PERILS AG.\nThat’s slightly higher than the last update to the industry loss estimate back in August, when PERILS said it was EUR 344 million at the time.\nEuropean windstorm Victoria(Dennis) struck the British Isles and areas of north-western Europe between the 15th and 17th February 2020, coming just six days after the more significant windstorm Sabine(Ciara, Elsa) which resulted in a much larger loss of close to EUR 1.6 billion.\nImpacts from storm Victoria / Dennis across the UK, Germany and Belgium drove the majority of the industry loss with wind gusts recorded at up to 100km/h.\nPERILS, the Zurich based aggregator of insurance and reinsurance market loss report data, pegged its initial estimate for the insured property market loss for extratropical cyclone Victoria(Dennis) at EUR 286 million back at the end of March.\nThat was then lifted to EUR 344 million in August 2020 and has now been finalised at this new figure of EUR 350 million.\nVictoria was a particularly long-tracked European windstorm.\nPERILS explained, \"Victoria was originally identified on 11 February 2020 when it was still located over the US. Travelling across the mid-Atlantic in a north-easterly direction, it underwent a so-called \"explosive cyclogenesis\" which included a rapid deepening of its central air pressure to 920mB, one of the lowest values measured over the North Atlantic since records began more than 150 years ago.\"\nBoth storms Victoria and Sabine came close to a period of severe flooding in the UK, which PERILS will be releasing an updated industry loss for before the end of this month. related to Victoria|Dennis,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Victoria|Dennis, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
