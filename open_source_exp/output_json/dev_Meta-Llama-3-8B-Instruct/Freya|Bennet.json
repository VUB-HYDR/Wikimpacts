Bennet is expected to have caused at least a EUR 200 million insurance and reinsurance market loss.\nIn addition storm Laura/Cornelius affected the UK and Scandinavian countries later that same week, while Dragi affected Northern Europe just prior to Eberhard.\nEuropean wind storm conditions continued this week with Franz/Gareth, as well as Gebhard and Heinz all current named depressions in the northern European region.\nAs a result, the overall insurance and reinsurance market loss from European wind storm conditions over the last fortnight could easily surpass EUR 2 billion, it seems.\nAIR said its industry loss estimate for storm Eberhard includes insured physical damage from wind to property(residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and auto), including structures and their contents, business interruption and additional living expenses(just for the UK). It does not include demand surge, infrastructure losses, coastal or inland flooding losses.\nCurrently PERILS AG, the catastrophe loss data aggregator, has storm Freya / Bennet under investigation, but does not have Eberhard listed on its website so far. Given this estimate size, it seems inevitable that PERILS will collect loss data from insurers and provide reports on this storm. related to Freya|Bennet,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Freya|Bennet, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
