This \"Quad-State\" event has resulted in extensive damage, and sadly, loss of life. pic.twitter.com/JVNBoKaN7w\n— Steve Bowen(@SteveBowenWx) December 11, 2021\nAn Amazon distribution warehouse was badly hit in Edwardsville, Illinois, with a significant casualty event expected there by authorities and likely a significant insurance claim.\nThe most significant loss of life has been reported in Mayfield, Kentucky, where terrible scenes of widespread destruction are emerging and local authorities suggest between 50 and 100 deaths will ultimately be reported.\nIt’s expected to be the most deadly and perhaps destructive Kentucky tornado outbreak, with a large number of the deaths expected to come from a factor that was destroyed.\nBrandon Clement, of WxChasing, tweeted video and images showing the scale of the damage suffered in Mayfield, Kentucky:\nHorrific sight at first light from #tornado damage in #Mayfield Kentucky. #Wxtwitter pic.twitter.com/KSjTpko9nz\n— WxChasing- Brandon Clement(@bclemms) December 11, 2021\nThis pretty much sums it up in:19. #Mayfield #MayfieldTornado #KyWx #WX pic.twitter.com/IcPL4XGtPS\n— WxChasing- Brandon Clement(@bclemms) December 11, 2021\nEasily an EF-4. This is still #MayfieldKY pic.twitter.com/PN0wU8gKZz\n— WxChasing- Brandon Clement(@bclemms) December 11, 2021\nBut property damage from this tornado and more broadly across at least four states from the significant severe convective storm activity, will likely aggregate into a relatively significant insurance and perhaps reinsurance market loss.\nAs ever, it’s impossible to foresee just how costly this severe storm and tornado outbreak could be, either on an economic or insured loss basis.\nBut given the wide-reaching impacts, the severity of the damage images coming out of some of these states, the associated property damage from strong straight-line winds, hail and other storm effects outside of the tornadoes, it’s possible the industry will need to brace for a relatively significant loss pronouncement, one of, if not the most costly severe storm outbreak of the year, once more data is available.\n2021 has already seen more than $20 billion in insurance industry losses from severe weather, according to some data providers.\nThis tornado outbreak will drive the total a good deal higher it seems and the cost will be unusual for a December outbreak. related to the Quad-State Tornado,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by the Quad-State Tornado, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
