Named by the Free University of Berlin Meteorology Department, the storm was an extratropical cyclone formed as a secondary low to a more northerly centre of low pressure named Grischa coming southward from the Svalbard Islands region, the latter splitting in two low-pressure areas late on 28 October. The center of Herwart started rotating counterclockwise around the main low pressure area, passing over Norway, Sweden, Latvia and then losing power while moving over western Russia.\nIn Denmark, which was hit on 28 October, the storm was named Ingolf. In Hungary, the storm was named Nárcisz(Narcissus), a Hungarian female name whose name day is on 29 October.\n-Meteorological history-\n-Impact-\nThe storm and rainfall caused death and destruction. Train connections were closed in Northern Germany, and major bridges in Denmark were closed for traffic. Herwart caused disruption to the German energy market as the strong winds caused an over-supply of energy onto the German power grid. Prices for energy slipped into negative values as low as minus €83.06 per megawatt hour, with an average low of minus €52.11(normal energy prices are €37 per megawatt hour). These values were the lowest since Christmas 2012. This can lead to a situation where Austria and Switzerland find it attractive to use the energy in their pumped storage reservoirs, where it can later be sold back to Germany.\nHerwart was not as strong as Xavier which struck Germany earlier in October 2017. Herwart is considered one of the strongest storms of the past 10 years in Germany, ranked in 8th place in the strongest storms there in the last decade, but not considered memorable when compared to the strongest storms such as Kyrill(2007) and Lothar(1999). Herwart was responsible for the worst insurance losses in the Czech Republic since the storms Kyrill and Emma(2008). related to Cyclone Herwart,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Cyclone Herwart, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions. The information should be organized in JSON format as follows:\n        - \"Total_Summary_Damage\": {\n        - \"Total_Damage\": \"Specify the economic loss or damage reported. If this information is not mentioned, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Total_Damage_Units\": \"Indicate the currency of the reported damage (e.g., USD, EUR). If the currency is not specified, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Total_Damage_Inflation_Adjusted\": \"State 'Yes' if the reported damage amount has been adjusted for inflation; otherwise, indicate 'No'. If this aspect is not mentioned, provide your best judgment based on the context.\"\n        - \"Total_Damage_Inflation_Adjusted_Year\": \"Mention the year used for inflation adjustment, if applicable. If the amount is not adjusted for inflation or this detail is not provided, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Economic_Impact_with_annotation\": \"Directly quote portions of the text that substantiate your findings on the total economic loss or damage. This should directly quote the original text.\"\n        }\n        If the \"Total_Damage\" is not \"NULL\" or \"0\", then, delve deeper to provide a detailed breakdown of economic damages by country. \n        For the first instance in the \"Specific_Instance_Per_Country_Economic_Damage\" section for each country, provide a summary of the total economic damage within that country and the \"Location_Damage\" is the country name, \n        followed by a breakdown into specific cities, towns, or regions where possible.\n        Organize this information in JSON format as follows:\n        - \"Specific_Instance_Per_Country_Damage\":[ {\n        - \"Country\": \"Name of the country.\",\n        - \"Location_Damage\": \"The specific place within the country where the economic impact occurred, including towns, cities, or regions.\"\n        - \"Damage\": \"The amount of economic damage.\"\n        - \"Damage_Units\": \"The currency of the economic damage, like USD, EUR.
