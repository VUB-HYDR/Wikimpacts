    "prompt": "\n        Based on the provided article, which includes the information box None and the full text \n---Euro windstorm Hendrik-Ignatz (Aurore) industry loss estimated €311m---\nEuropean extratropical windstorm Hendrik- Ignatz, which was also known as Aurore, impacted north-western and central Europe between the 20th to 21st October 2021 and is the first storm of the season to drive an industry loss in the hundreds of millions of Euros.\nEuropean windstorm Hendrik- Ignatz(Aurore) is the first of the winter 2021/2022 storm season to require industry loss reporting from specialist PERILS AG.\nThe company has pegged its initial estimate for insurance and reinsurance market losses for the storm at EUR 311 million.\nThe two low-pressure systems associated with the windstorm event were named \"Hendrik\" and \"Ignatz\" by the Free University of Berlin, and the storm was also named Aurore by Meteo France.\nThe total industry loss is going to be higher than PERILS estimate.\nThe company noted that the majority of the losses from this windstorm occurred in France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg.\nSwitzerland and the Netherlands were also impacted to a limited extent, but losses were also experienced in Poland and the Czech Republic, which are countries PERILS does not report on.\nEuropean windstorm Hendrik-Ignatz formed on the back of an unusually strong jet stream for mid-October with wind speeds of up to 250 km/h.\nPERILS notes that this drove low-pressure system Hendrik and its marginal low Ignatz across the Irish Sea and as far as northern Russia within only a two-day period, a particularly fast moving storm.\nStrong surface winds were experienced across France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic, because of the pressure gradient that developed.\nWidespread but short-duration travel and power disruption was seen in the affected countries, while property damage was dominated by non-structural losses to roofs, windows, chimneys and cladding, with more severe damage caused by trees falling on properties as well.\nWhile the wind field generated by Hendrik-Ignatz was extensive, wind gusts were not extreme and rarely exceeded 120km/h in populated areas, PERILS said.\nBut as a result, the insurance and reinsurance industry loss is set to be comparatively moderate and PERILS notes this level of industry loss can be expected to be reached or exceeded at least once a year during the European windstorm season. related to Hendrik-Ignatz|Aurore,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Hendrik-Ignatz|Aurore, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions. The information should be organized in JSON format as follows:\n        - \"Total_Summary_Damage\": {\n        - \"Total_Damage\": \"Specify the economic loss or damage reported. If this information is not mentioned, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Total_Damage_Units\": \"Indicate the currency of the reported damage (e.g., USD, EUR). If the currency is not specified, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Total_Damage_Inflation_Adjusted\": \"State 'Yes' if the reported damage amount has been adjusted for inflation; otherwise, indicate 'No'. If this aspect is not mentioned, provide your best judgment based on the context.\"\n        - \"Total_Damage_Inflation_Adjusted_Year\": \"Mention the year used for inflation adjustment, if applicable. If the amount is not adjusted for inflation or this detail is not provided, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Economic_Impact_with_annotation\": \"Directly quote portions of the text that substantiate your findings on the total economic loss or damage. This should directly quote the original text.\"\n        }\n        If the \"Total_Damage\" is not \"NULL\" or \"0\", then, delve deeper to provide a detailed breakdown of economic damages by country. \n        For the first instance in the \"Specific_Instance_Per_Country_Economic_Damage\" section for each country, provide a summary of the total economic damage within that country and the \"Location_Damage\" is the country name, \n        followed by a breakdown into specific cities, towns, or regions where possible.\n        Organize this information in JSON format as follows:\n        - \"Specific_Instance_Per_Country_Damage\":[ {\n        - \"Country\": \"Name of the country.\",\n        - \"Location_Damage\": \"The specific place within the country where the economic impact occurred, including towns, cities, or regions.\"\n        - \"Damage\": \"The amount of economic damage.\"\n        - \"Damage_Units\": \"The currency of the economic damage, like USD, EUR. If not specified, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Damage_Inflation_Adjusted\": \"Indicate 'Yes' if the damage amount has been adjusted for inflation; otherwise, 'No'.\"\n        - \"Damage_Inflation_Adjusted_Year\": \"The year of inflation adjustment, if applicable. If not adjusted or not applicable, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Damage_Assessment_with_annotation\": \"Include text from the original article that supports your findings on the economic impact amount and details for each specific instance. This should directly quote the original text.\"\n          }]\n        Ensure to capture all instances of economic loss or damage mentioned in the article, including direct and indirect causes, and organize them in the JSON format output.\n        Please produce the response strictly in JSON format.
