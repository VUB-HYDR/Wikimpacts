These heat waves were the deadliest meteorological events in 2022. The highest temperature recorded was 47.0 °C(116.6 °F) in Pinhão, Portugal, on 14 July.\nIn June 2022, temperatures of 40–43 °C(104–109 °F) were recorded in parts of Europe, with most severe temperature anomalies in France, where several records were broken.\nA second more severe heatwave occurred in mid-July, extending north to the United Kingdom where temperatures surpassing 40 °C(104 °F) were recorded for the first time. The heatwaves were part of climate change in Europe.\nA third heatwave began in August with parts of France and Spain expected to reach temperatures as high as 38 °C(100 °F). A prolonged hot period also hit the United Kingdom.\nAlthough temperatures in most places in Europe subsided in August, a smaller heatwave impacted France on 12 September, with temperatures reaching 40.1 °C(104.2 °F).\nAs a result of the heatwaves, widespread droughts occurred across the continent.\nEurostat reported that the European Union saw 53,000 excess deaths in July, some of which may have occurred because of the heat wave. The excess death rate was several times higher than in July 2020 or July 2021, a statistic notable due to the COVID-19 pandemic having taken place in Europe during those years. The worst increases were seen in Spain and Cyprus.\n-Meteorology-\nThe June heatwave was the result of an interaction among the high pressures that generate atmospheric stability; Tropical Storm Alex, the strong sunshine of the boreal summer and an air mass emanating from North Africa that had entered the Iberian Peninsula loaded with suspended dust that caused haze in the centre and south of the peninsula.\nClimatologists linked the extreme heat to the impact of climate change, and experts predict that changes in the jet stream as a result of climate change will cause heatwaves with increasing frequency in Europe. Furthermore, due to the jet stream, the increase in heatwaves for European countries is three-to-four times higher than other countries in northern mid-latitudes, such as the United States.\n-By country-\nReports of the death toll varied significantly. In July 2023, researchers from Barcelona Institute for Global Health estimated 61,672 heat-induced problems between 30 May and 4 September in a finding published in Nature Medical. The study gathered data from 35 countries with a combined population of 543 million people. A statistical framework was paired against historical meteorological records to observe the trend of deaths. The researchers said that they used weekly mortality data to develop their model which may not allow for short-term changes and hence may underestimate the actual number of deaths. Countries around the Mediterranean Sea, especially Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, experienced higher death rates. In November 2022, Reuters stated that there were 20,000 \"excess\" deaths recorded; deaths which officials did not directly attribute to heat but may be heat-induced. In November 2023, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health revised their number to over 70,000 \"excess\" deaths after developing a new method to calculate the mortality rate. The new research utilised daily temperature and mortality data as opposed to the previous research method using weekly data. The researchers claimed the previous figure underestimated the true number by 10.28 percent.\n--Andorra--\nOn 15 June, Andorra's weather agency, the National Meteorological Service of Andorra, issued a \"significant danger weather warning\" due to heat. The weather warning was expected to last until 27 July with 24 and 25 July being the days in which the agency expected to raise the warning to \"extreme danger weather warning\". In the nation's capital, Andorra la Vella, temperatures were recorded to be over 36 °C(97 °F), far higher than the average for the time of year.\n--Austria--\nOn 30 June, a temperature of 36.7 °C(98.1 °F) was recorded in Bad Deutsch-Altenburg, this was also Austria's heat record for June.\nOn 5 August, a temperature of 36.3 °C(97.3 °F) was recorded in Austria's capital city Vienna.\n--Belgium--\nOn 19 July, the temperature reached 38.1 °C(100.6 °F) in Uccle, with the highest temperature that day being 40.0 °C(104.0 °F) in Kapelle-op-den-Bos.\n--Croatia--\nThe heat dome which caused extreme temperatures in north-west Europe was expected to affect Croatia from 21 to 24 July. Temperatures peaked on 23 July, reaching 38–39 °C(100–102 °F) in cities including Zagreb, Osijek, Karlovac, Slavonski Brod, Knin. The highest temperature of 39.4 °C(102.9 °F) was recorded in Valpovo. Temperatures exceeding 40 °C(104 °F) were also recorded, but only at unofficial weather stations. The heat was ended the same day by a cold front in continental Croatia, but higher temperatures continued in the southern part of the country, which had been suffering a drought since 2021.\n--Denmark--\nOn 20 July, it reached 35.9 °C(96.6 °F) in Abed, Stokkemarke Parish, Lolland Municipality, breaking the all-time temperature record for that month. Copenhagen measured its record highest temperature when it reached 35.6 °C(96.1 °F), breaking the previous 2006 record. In Vordingborg it reached 35.8 °C(96.4 °F), and stayed above 35 °C(95 °F) for 4 hours, another Danish record.\n--Finland--\nFinland was hit by the heatwaves in late June and early July. The highest temperature of 32.5 °C(90.5 °F) was measured on 29 June in Utsjoki.\n--France--\n---June heatwave---\nOn 16 June, Météo-France activated its red alert in 12 departments and its orange alert in another 25 because of the heatwave. The departments on red alert were mainly those located in the south-west, along the Atlantic coast and the south; the heat was generally less severe further north and east. The heatwave was the earliest in the year since records began and marked the fourth time that a red heat alert had been issued since the protocol was activated after the 2003 heatwave.\nOn 17 June, the red alert was activated in 14 more departments, adding the Hautes-Pyrénées and the Pyrénées-Atlantiques to the 12 of the previous day. The orange alert was activated in 56 more departments.\n---July heatwave---\nAn estimated total of more than 20,800 ha(51,000 acres) were burnt by wildfires in Gironde, causing a total of near 37,000 people to be evacuated.\nOn 20 July, a baby died in an overheated car in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques. Authorities reported the deaths of two others in work-related accidents, which was raised to four on 28 July, all likely attributed to the extreme heat.\nTemperatures exceeded 40 °C(104 °F) even in Brittany, which is unprecedented. It reached 42.6 °C(108.7 °F) in Biscarrosse(Landes), 42.4 °C(108.3 °F) in Cazaux(Gironde), 42.0 °C(107.6 °F) in Nantes(Loire-Atlantique), 41.5 °C(106.7 °F) in La Roche-sur-Yon(Vendée), 40.3 °C(104.5 °F) in Lanmeur(Finistère) and 39.3 °C(102.7 °F) in Brest(Finistère).\nThis July heatwave aggravated the drought that had been ongoing in the country since the start of the year, making July 2022 the driest July since records began.\n---September heatwave---\nA smaller heatwave affected southwestern France on 12 September, where temperatures reached as high as 40.1 °C(104.2 °F) in Bégaar. According to Meteociel, monthly temperature records were broken at more than 70 Météo France stations.\n---Deaths---\nThe French Public Health Agency officially reported 7,000 deaths. On 6 September, Le Monde unveiled a report by INSEE, estimating the number of deaths due to the summer(between 1 June and 22 August) heatwaves was likely 11,000.\n--Germany--\n---June heatwave---\nFrom 14 to 20 June, Germany saw 1,636 probable heat-related deaths attributed to temperatures reaching 39.2 °C(102.6 °F).\n---July heatwave---\nFrom 11 to 17 July, Germany saw an all-deaths excess death rate of 16% followed by 23% in the week from 18 to 24 July. This corresponds to 6,502 excess deaths. On 20 July, temperatures in several states reached new records. Temperatures in Hamburg reached 40.1 °C(104.2 °F), 40.0 °C(104.0 °F) in Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, 39.6 °C(103.3 °F) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and 39.1 °C(102.4 °F) in Schleswig-Holstein.\nThe highest temperature recorded on 20 July was 40.3 °C(104.5 °F) in Bad Mergentheim.\n---Deaths---\nThe Robert Koch Institute put the death toll of the heatwaves at over 4,500.\n--Greece--\nFrom mid–June to mid–August, Greece experienced one of its biggest heatwaves. A temperature of 42.1 °C(107.8 °F) was recorded on 23 June in Fthiotida.\n--Guernsey and Jersey--\nOn 18 July, a temperature of 34.2 °C(93.6 °F) was recorded at Guernsey Airport, the record for July and just 0.1 °C lower than Guernsey's all time record, which was on 9 August 2003.\nAlso on 18 July, a temperature of 37.9 °C(100.2 °F) was recorded at Maison St Louis Observatory, Jersey, the highest temperature ever recorded in Jersey.\n--Hungary--\n---July heatwave---\nOn 22 July, a temperature of 38.5 °C(101.3 °F) was reported at Újpest in Budapest, which broke the maximum temperature record for that day in the city. On 23 July, a temperature of 41.5 °C(106.7 °F) was recorded at Kiskunfélegyháza and Hódmezővásárhely, which almost broke the all-time temperature record of 41.9 °C(107.4 °F) in Hungary.\n---August heatwave---\nOn 2 August, Lake Velence reached record low water levels of 58 cm(23 in) due to severe drought.\nOn 3 August, the National Meteorological Service issued a third-level heat warning, with temperatures forecast to reach the low 30s and possibly exceeding 35 °C(95 °F) from 4 to 6 August.\nOn 9 August, the National Directorate General for Water issued a press release, which stated that in the first 7 months of 2022, the amount of rainfall was 45 per cent below average, making it the driest year since 1901.\nOn 16 August, the National Meteorological Service issued a third-level heat warning, with temperatures forecast to reach above 35 °C(95 °F) from 17 to 19 August. On 17 August, a temperature of 37 °C(99 °F) was recorded at Baja and Kübekháza, breaking the Hungarian temperature record for that day. Due to the heat warning, the Hungarian State Railways and Volánbusz were distributing mineral water at major railway stations, rural railway stations and bus stations.\n--Iceland--\nOn 15 August 2022 the temperature reached 30.1 °C(86.2 °F) in Neskaupstadur. \nIt was Iceland's warmest day since 22 June 1939.\n--Ireland--\n---July heatwave---\nMet Éireann issued a high-temperature advisory on 13 July, with temperatures forecast to reach the high 20s and possibly exceeding 30 °C(86 °F) from 17 to 19 July. Met Éireann subsequently issued a Status Yellow high-temperature warning for Ireland on 15 July, with \"exceptionally\" high temperatures possibly reaching 32 °C(90 °F).\nOn 18 July, a temperature of 33.2 °C(91.8 °F) was reported at Allenwood one of the highest temperatures ever recorded in Ireland, breaking the Irish temperature record for July. The record highest temperature had been 33.3 °C(91.9 °F) at Kilkenny Castle in June 1887, but some in recent years have called for the reassessment of the previous record.\n---August heatwave---\nMet Éireann issued a high-temperature advisory on 7 August, with temperatures forecast to reach above 25 °C(77 °F) for a period of five days or more from 10 to 14 August. Met Éireann subsequently issued a Status Yellow high-temperature warning for Leinster and Munster on 9 August, warning of \"very warm or hot\" from 11 to 13 August, with \"maximum temperatures of 27–29 °C(81–84 °F)\". Met Éireann extended its high-temperature warning nationwide from 12 August with highs of 30 °C(86 °F) forecast.\nOn 12 August, a temperature of 31.7 °C(89.1 °F) was reported at Oak Park, County Carlow, breaking the Irish temperature record for August.\nMet Éireann issued a nationwide Status Orange thunderstorm warning on 14 August, with heavy downpours of rain and hail forecast.\nOn 15 August the forecasted thunderstorms caused flooding, mainly in County Roscommon and County Carlow.\nIrish Water appealed to people to conserve water as much as possible and warned that 37 water supplies around the country were being impacted by drought conditions.\n--Italy--\n---June to August heatwave---\nIn Italy, the number of wildfires was three times the historical average by the end of June. Temperatures in Rome reached 40.8 °C(105.4 °F) on 28 June. On 22 July, sixteen cities including Rome were put on the red state of alert, the country's highest heatwave alert to warn of serious health risks. A glacier collapse on the mountain of Marmolada on 4 July killed eleven, and was attributed to the abnormally warm temperatures. On 5 July, a state of emergency was declared in five northern regions in response to a severe drought in the Po valley, the worst in 70 years, and later for Tuscany. In total, an estimated 18,010 excess deaths were reported due to the heat wave.\nOn the evening of 18 July, a large fire began in Massarosa, Lucca, which has destroyed 900 ha(2,200 acres) as of 21 July 2022, reaching the province of Pisa.\nOn 19 July in Trieste, there was a blackout caused by a fire in Carso.\n---October heatwave---\nFrom 3 October a new heat wave(first high pressure from the Azores, and then an African anticyclone) hits Italy, bringing drought back to northern Italy despite another 4 previous months of absent rains. 30 °C is exceeded in many locations.\n--Luxembourg--\nOn 18 June, the temperature reached 33.8 °C(92.8 °F) in Luxembourg City.\nOn 19 July, it reached 36.3 °C(97.3 °F) in Luxembourg City.

On 19 July the temperature in Maastricht reached 39.5 °C(103.1 °F).\nExtreme heat is rare in the Netherlands; there have been only nine days with temperatures above 35 °C(95 °F) since the start of measurement at the central weather station in 1901(as of 18 July 2022). In 2019, the Netherlands experienced temperatures surpassing 40 °C(104 °F) for the first time in recorded history, with 40.7 °C(105.3 °F) recorded in Gilze-Rijen.\nAccording to satellite measurements, the southernmost Belgium–Netherlands border may have reached 42 °C(108 °F), which could be the highest provisional temperature recorded in the country.\n--Norway--\n---June heatwave---\nOn 28 June, Tromsø reached 29.7 °C(85.5 °F) and Saltdal reached 31.6 °C(88.9 °F), both records for June. Mehamn reached 30.8 °C(87.4 °F), higher than its previous record for June by almost 10 degrees.\n---July heatwave---\nIn July, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute reported that several areas may reach temperatures higher than 30 °C(86 °F). In Stavanger, temperatures are forecasted to reach 32 °C(90 °F). In Nordland, 20 and 21 July were forecasted to be the hottest days, with temperatures above 25 °C(77 °F). In Øst-Finnmark and Finnmarksvidda, temperatures on 21 and 22 July were predicted to reach 25 °C(77 °F). However, the Meteorological Institute does not believe that any national records will be broken.\n--Poland--\nOn 19 June, temperatures in western Poland exceeded 36 °C(97 °F). In Słubice, the highest temperature was 38.3 °C(100.9 °F), which equals the record for highest June temperature(set in 2019). Once again, temperatures peaked at the end of the month. On 30 June, nine meteorological stations recorded record-breaking monthly temperatures. New monthly records were also set on 1 July. In Tarnów, the temperature reached 37.7 °C(99.9 °F), breaking the record for July. Krosno recorded 35.5 °C(95.9 °F), the highest temperature in that station's history.\nOn 24 June, a man died in the queue of cars at the Polish-Ukrainian border by suspected overheating. On 26 June in Płońsk, a man died from a suspected sunstroke.\n--Portugal--\nAccording to Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera(IPMA), the heatwave was the longest and had the greatest area extension of any July heatwave in Portugal since 1941. Two towns in the central part of the country, Alvega and Mora, registered maximum daily temperatures between 40 and 46 °C(104 and 115 °F) for ten days in a row, and Pinhão, a town situated in Northern Portugal's Douro Valley, recorded 47.0 °C(116.6 °F), the highest temperature ever recorded in the month of July.\nIn July, a total of 30,000 ha(74,000 acres) were burnt by wildfires in Leiria, blocking a part of the A1 motorway that runs from Porto to Lisbon. In Algarve, a fire began in the city of Faro that spread to the Quinta do Lago resort. According to the Civil Protection Authority, at least 135 people were injured since the wildfires began. A pilot died when his waterbombing plane crashed in Vila Nova de Foz Côa while combating wildfires in the region.\nAt least 238 people died and 187 were injured because of the heat. According to the Portuguese Health Ministry, the heatwave killed 1,063 people between 7 and 18 July. Three people—two firefighters and a civilian—died in wildfires triggered by the heatwaves.\n--San Marino--\nIn late July, San Marino experienced a heatwave. On 24 July the temperature reached 39.6 °C(103.3 °F) in Dogana.\n--Serbia--\nOn 23 July the temperature reached 40.0 °C(104.0 °F) in Niš, only 4.9 °C under the record from 2007.\n--Slovakia--\nThe first tropical day(Slovak: tropický deň), a day with a temperature of over 30 °C(86 °F) as defined by the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute, was recorded in Dolné Plachtince on 22 June. On 26 June, several weather stations in the Eastern Slovakia and Banská Bystrica Region reported temperatures around 33 °C(91 °F). The inflow of warm air from the south-west intensified to the point when at least two weather stations recorded a temperature of 35 °C(95 °F) or more from 27 June until the end of the month. On 29 June, several stations reported a temperature of 37 °C(99 °F).\n--Romania--\nOn 24 July the temperature reached 39.3 °C(102.7 °F) in Bucharest and Craiova.\n--Slovenia--\n---Summer heat waves---\nOn 28 June, the Slovenian Environment Agency(ARSO) recorded a temperature of 38.0 °C(100.4 °F) in Podnanos. It surpassed Slovenia's previous record June temperature of 37.5 °C(99.5 °F), which was recorded in Metlika in 2000.\nOn 4 July, the ARSO reported that temperatures reached 38.4 °C(101.1 °F) in Bilje. At the agency's stations in Podnanos and Volče near Tolmin, temperatures reached 38.0 °C(100.4 °F) on 4 July and 38.9 °C(102.0 °F) on 22 July, respectively. On 23 July, temperatures of 38.0 °C(100.4 °F) or higher were recorded at several stations in the ARSO network, reaching 38.9 °C(102.0 °F) at Cerklje ob Krki Airport and 39.4 °C(102.9 °F) in Dobliče, with the latter remaining the highest temperature that was officially recorded in Slovenia during the month, meaning that the country's record July temperature of 40.6 °C(105.1 °F), which was recorded in 1950 in the nearby town of Črnomelj, was not surpassed.\nIn mid-July, the ARSO reported the status of droughts as significant or severe for most of western and central Slovenia. By the end of the month, agriculture was affected by droughts in the entire country, although they were especially severe in its south-west.\nAlong with periods of wind, long-lasting and severe droughts were mentioned as one of the key factors that facilitated the spread of the wildfires that broke out in the Karst Plateau around the southern part of the Italy–Slovenia border on 17 July and became the most extensive spread of wildfires ever recorded in Slovenia three days later, when it was reported that an estimated 1,900 ha(4,700 acres) of land were burnt. By 25 July, the spread of the wildfires in the Karst Plateau was largely stopped, but minor fires were still appearing in the affected areas. It was initially estimated that 3,500 ha(8,600 acres) of land were burnt and the estimate was updated to 3,600 ha(8,900 acres) on 1 August, following a few minor spreads that were quickly stopped.\nOn 5 August, temperatures exceeding 37.0 °C(98.6 °F) were recorded at five stations in the ARSO network, reaching 37.5 °C(99.5 °F) in Dobliče, Litija and the Bežigrad District of Ljubljana, and 37.1 °C(98.8 °F) in Celje and at Cerklje ob Krki Airport. On 18 August, temperatures of 34.0 °C(93.2 °F) or higher were expected in many parts of Slovenia.\nOn 1 September, the ARSO reported that temperatures of 30.0 °C(86.0 °F) or higher were recorded in Bilje on a total of 80 days, which surpassed the location's previous record of 76 days and a national record of 77 days in Podnanos, both of which were recorded in 2003.\n---Autumn heat waves---\nOn 14 September, temperatures of up to 29.0 °C(84.2 °F) were expected. The night between 14 and 15 September was unusually hot in many parts of Slovenia. The ARSO reported that temperatures did not fall below 20.0 °C(68.0 °F) at several stations in their network, with the one at Portorož Airport not recording temperatures lower than 24.4 °C(75.9 °F) during the night.\nOn 1 November, temperatures exceeded 25.0 °C(77.0 °F) at several stations in the ARSO network, reaching 26.2 °C(79.2 °F) in Dobliče and exceeding the location's previous record November temperature of 25.2 °C(77.4 °F). New records were set at several other stations in the ARSO network and Slovenia's previous record November temperature of 25.6 °C(78.1 °F), which was recorded in Metlika in 2015, was surpassed at four of the agency's stations.\n--Spain--\n---June heatwave---\nA special heat warning was activated by the AEMET on 10 June, but only for 12 provinces and with yellow alerts in Aragon, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, Extremadura and Madrid, with an orange alert for Andalusia. In this first stage, the unusual heat did not affect the Canary Islands, Galicia, the western Cantabrian coast and points of the peninsular Mediterranean coast. Initially, the AEMET predicted that the heatwave would last until 15 June, although it speculated that the heat might continue for the rest of the week.\nOn 11 June, high temperatures were recorded in the south-west of the peninsula, with 41.0 °C(105.8 °F) in Seville. The alerts also remained activated for Aragon, Castile and León, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia and Madrid at a yellow level, and at an orange level for Extremadura and Andalusia. However, the weather conditions did not meet the official criteria to start the heatwave.\nOn 12 June, temperatures reached 43.2 °C(109.8 °F) in Almadén(Ciudad Real), the highest value on the official start day of the heatwave. Temperatures above 40 °C(104 °F) were also recorded at 47 stations in the AEMET network. The agency issued special notice number 3/2022 with information about the phenomenon and initiated a national plan of preventive actions with a level-assignment map.\nOn 14 June, the heatwave spread to the south of Galicia and the interior of the Cantabrian Sea. Tropical nights also continued, with temperatures that did not fall below 20 °C(68 °F) in many provinces; in Jaén, a minimum of 27 °C(81 °F) was expected. It was predicted that the peak of the heatwave would be reached on Friday, 17 June, with the possibility of record-breaking temperatures in Zaragoza, Lleida and Córdoba.\nThe only points in Spain that were not affected are Asturias, the Canary Islands and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. In its daily statement, AEMET predicted the end of the weather episode for 18 June, with hot African air causing instability and a drop in temperatures.\nRubén del Campo of AEMET stated that it was the \"most intense heatwave for mid-June of, at least, the last 20 years.\"\nThe first day of application of the \"Iberian exception\", by which the regulated price of electricity is calculated with a cap on gas for its generation, was 15 June. The PVPC is the voluntary price for the small consumer, for which more will be paid for electricity for compensation to thermal power plants and the greater use of gas and coal in the midst of a heatwave.\nThe last day of the Spanish heatwave was 18 June, an event termed \"intense, extensive and extraordinary\" according to AEMET, which determined that the springtime heatwave was among the earliest in the year since Spain began keeping records.\nEstimates from the Carlos III Health Institute placed the total June death toll at 830.\n---July heatwave---\nIn July, Extremadura experienced wildfires that spread to Salamanca in Castile and León and burnt more than 4,000 ha(9,900 acres).\nOn 14 July, the Carlos III Health Institute announced that at least 43 people had died on 10 and 11 July from the heat. On 16 July, at least 360 people died between 10 July and 15 July from the heat.\nOn 17 July, a wildfire began in El Pont de Vilomara, Catalonia, which burnt 30 houses and more than 1,700 ha(4,200 acres) of land.\nOn 18 July, the Carlos III Health Institute reported an additional 150 heat-related deaths on 16 July, bringing the total death toll to 510, which was raised to 679 the next day. Final estimates from the Carlos III Health Institute placed the total July death toll at 2,063. However, in a report published later in the year, the July death toll was placed at 2,223.\nOn 24 July, the Seville city council gave the ongoing heat wave the name Zoe, thereby making it the first named heat wave in the world.\nDuring July, Córdoba had a average high of 40.4 °C(104.7 °F), with 19 days above 40 °C(104 °F), making it the highest average maximum temperature ever recorded in Europe for the month of July.\nThe drought at the Valdecañas reservoir revealed the Dolmen of Guadalperal, a prehistoric stone circle.\n---August heatwave---\nParts of Spain are expected to reach temperatures as high as 38 °C(100 °F).\nIn a report published later in the year, the August death toll was placed at 1,602.\n--Sweden--\nDuring the summer of 2022, Sweden experienced three heatwaves in late June, July, and mid August.\nThe highest temperature was measured on 21 July when the temperature reached 37.2 °C(99.0 °F) in Målilla.
