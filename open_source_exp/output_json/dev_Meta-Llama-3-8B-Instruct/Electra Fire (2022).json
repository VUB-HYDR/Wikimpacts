The wildfire burned a total of 4,478 acres(1,812 ha) and was fully contained on July 28, 2022.\n-Background-\nNorthern California experienced many large and destructive wildfires in the summer of 2021, all of them exacerbated by drought and prolonged heat waves such as the 2021 Western North America heat wave. Multiple fires burned in or near Shasta County, including the Salt Fire and the Dixie Fire. The immediate area had no significant or recent fire history, though the 1999 Jones Fire and 2004 Bear Fire burned a combined 37,000 acres and hundreds of structures in the Jones Valley region just to the east of the Fawn Fire's footprint.\n-Progression-\n--Context--\nIn the immediate impact zone of the Electra Fire, the historic September 2015 Butte Fire destroyed much of native vegetation throughout the canyons the Electra Fire would later burn in. The Butte Fire was a significant, deadly and destructive wildfire ignited when a tree branch came in contact with a Pacific Gas & Electric Company powerline. The Butte Fire would later grow to 70,868 acres, destroyed 877 homes and businesses and damage 44 more—as well as lead to the deaths of two civilians. By contrast, the Electra Fire—while still growing to a significant 4,478 acres—was far less destructive.\n--July 4--\nThe Electra Fire ignited at 6:42 PM PDT and rapidly grew at the site of a recreation area, forcing 85 to 100 nearby civilians celebrating the Independence Day holiday at a river to shelter in place at a PG&E facility as the fire passed through the area. The crowd of roughly 100 people was safely evacuated from the facility later that night. Immediate Mandatory evacuation orders and warnings were put in place which combined affected about 500 people in Amador County and 300 to 400 people in Calaveras County. The fire—dubbed the Electra Fire due to its ignition source being close in proximity to Electra Road along the North Fork of the Mokelumne River and Vaught's Beach—was first reported at 75 acres in size and burning at a dangerous rate of spread in dry grass had ballooned to 959 acres in size by 7 PM.\nOver 1,300 firefighting personnel were ordered to contain the inferno and by 10 PM, fire activity had relatively diminished allowing crews to conduct controlled burns as a form of containment for the fire. Throughout the night, the fire grew an additional 2,000 acres in size to some 3,034 acres by morning time the next day with containment remaining at zero percent.\n\n== References == related to Electra Fire (2022),\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Electra Fire (2022), focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.

If this information is not mentioned, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Total_Damage_Units\": \"Indicate the currency of the reported damage (e.g., USD, EUR). If the currency is not specified, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Total_Damage_Inflation_Adjusted\": \"State 'Yes' if the reported damage amount has been adjusted for inflation; otherwise, indicate 'No'. If this aspect is not mentioned, provide your best judgment based on the context.\"\n        - \"Total_Damage_Inflation_Adjusted_Year\": \"Mention the year used for inflation adjustment, if applicable. If the amount is not adjusted for inflation or this detail is not provided, assign 'NULL'.\"\n        - \"Economic_Impact_with_annotation\": \"Directly quote portions of the text that substantiate your findings on the total economic loss or damage. This should directly quote the original text.\"\n        }\n        If the \"Total_Damage\" is not \"NULL\" or \"0\", then, delve deeper to provide a detailed breakdown of economic damages by country. \n        For the first instance in the \"Specific_Instance_Per_Country_Economic_Damage\" section for each country, provide a summary of the total economic damage within that country and the \"Location_Damage\" is the country name, \n        followed by a breakdown into specific cities, towns, or regions where possible.\n        Organize this information in JSON format as follows:\n        - \"Specific_Instance_Per_Country_Damage\":[ {\n        - \"Country\": \"Name of the country.\",\n        - \"Location_Damage\": \"The specific place within the country where the economic impact occurred, including towns, cities, or regions.\"\n        - \"Damage\": \"The amount of economic damage.\"\n        - \"Damage_Units\": \"The currency of the economic damage, like USD, EUR.
