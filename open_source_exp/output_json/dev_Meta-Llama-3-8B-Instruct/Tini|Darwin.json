Today it has announced a small increase to €253m(approximately £206m or $350m) based on ultimate gross loss data as reported by primary insurance companies.\nMore detail is available to subscribers to PERILS service. The third loss estimate for windstorm Tini will be made available on the 12th August 2014.\nUpdate on all European catastrophe events investigated by PERILS AG from this winter:\n---PERILS puts final European windstorm Tini loss estimate at €286m---\nThe final insurance industry loss estimate for European windstorm Tini, which struck in February 2014, has been put at at €286m by PERILS AG, the Swiss headquartered provider of industry-wide European catastrophe exposure, industry loss data and indices.\nEuropean windstorm Tini, also known as Darwin in some countries of Europe, impacted predominantly the UK and Ireland on the 12th and 13th February 2014, with the majority of the losses that occurred coming from those two countries.\nPERILS first estimated industry-wide insured losses for European windstorm Tini at €245m in March. It then revealed a small increase to €253m, based on ultimate gross loss data as reported by primary insurance companies, in May, before raising the estimate again to €281m in August 2014.\nNow, PERILS has released its fourth and final industry loss estimate for European windstorm Tini this morning, one year after the event itself in line with its reporting procedure. This fourth and final estimate of property market insurance industry losses sees a very small increase to €286m, which is approximately $325m or £215m.\nThe final loss estimate for European windstorm Tini is available at a higher level of granularity, with losses per CRESTA zone(two-digit postcode level) and per property sub-lines of business, Residential, Commercial, Industrial and Agricultural.\nThe map below shows how the insurance industry loss from European windstorm Tini was distributed.\nEuropean windstorm Tini map of insured property loss estimate footprint - Source: PERILS AG\nAfter a its busiest winter season in 2013/14, there has yet to be a European windstorm event that has required reporting from PERILS AG so far in the 2015 season, although it has likely investigated a few of the windstorms that struck Europe in January. This shows how variable weather patterns can be. You can see just how prolific European windstorms were in the 2013/14 season from the table of storm names PERILS investigated below.\nUpdate on all European catastrophe events investigated by PERILS AG from the winter 2013/14 windstorm season:\n---Euro windstorms, UK floods add up to meaningful insurance losses---\nThe procession of severe European windstorms continues to impact the UK and northern Europe, while severe flooding across the UK and northern France worsens, with financial losses for the insurance and reinsurance industry now rising fast.\nThe winter weather affecting northern Europe continues, with two more named European windstorms striking the UK in the last few days. Each time fresh storms and low pressure cross the Atlantic and slam into northern Europe and the UK, the rainfall brought with the storms is exacerbating an already severe level of flooding.\nThe UK is in the grip of some of the most extensive flooding seen in many years, with parts of the southwest having been under water for over a month and flooding now affected areas closer to London where property density and overall values at risk are significantly higher.\nEuropean windstorms\nJust this week European windstorm Tini struck the UK and Ireland and brought additional impacts to parts of northern France and Scandinavia. Tini brought additional heavy rainfall and winds with recorded gusts of over 100mph(160kph) caused structural damage and downed trees and power lines.\nTini is the 14th severe European windstorm of the current winter season. According to reinsurance broker Aon Benfield’s Impact Forecasting unit, an overall economic loss of at least $1 billion(EUR730m) is anticipated from windstorm Tini, adding to losses already suffered during the storm season.\nEuropean windstorm Tini satellite image\nEuropean windstorm Ulla followed closely on Tini’s heels, impacting the same regions, of Ireland, the UK, some of coastal northern France and moving on towards Scandinavia, on Friday. Storm Ulla coincided with high tides on the UK coast and has caused some of the worst coastal inundations seen in some areas this winter.\nUlla brought winds with gusts of at least 80mph to areas of Ireland, Wales and England, as well as additional heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving 40mm or more of rain.\nNow the 15th severe European windstorm of the season, at the moment it looks as if windstorm Ulla could be almost as severe as Tini, although the impacts are different and wind speeds were higher with Tini while coastal flood and surge may have been worse with Ulla. So Ulla could contribute another economic loss approaching $1 billion.\nEuropean windstorm Ulla, also showing storm Tini moving north\nUK floods\nThe UK floods are now some of the worst on record in parts of the country. Impact Forecasting said that since December 2013, at least 5,800 homes have been flooded in England. Of that total, 1,135 have been flooded in the Thames Valley area alone since January 29th 2014.\nRainfall levels in January were the highest since 1766, according to the UK Met Office, and February is so far trending well above the average rainfall amount expected.\nUK rainfall levels in December and January, leading to flooding\nA number of severe flood warnings remain in place and there is expected to be more damage in areas around the Thames and Severn rivers over the next couple of days. Groundwater levels in some parts of the UK are now extremely high, meaning that further flooding can be expected with any additional rainfall.\nThe flooding situation has been evolving rapidly, meaning that early estimates last week before the latest storms and rainfall are likely to be significantly under the final damage total. Some of the first estimates were for an economic loss of £1 billion and insured loss of £500m, but that is likely to be exceeded by some way.\nThe cost to the UK economy had been estimated at as much as £14 billion, from damage, lost business and general economic slowdown due to the severe flood events. In terms of economic damages, estimates now range from £1 billion to as much as £5 billion.\nSome of the latest estimates for the insured losses from the UK floods are for over £1 billion, with some suggesting that the final tally could approach flooding losses last seen in 2007 of £3 billion.\nAn analyst from Barclays said that a £1 billion flood insured loss would result in as much as a 12% post-tax profit hit at insurer RSA, 9% at Aviva and as much as 11% at Hiscox, according to this FT article.\nTotal insured losses from European windstorms and floods\nIt is impossible to accurately forecast the losses from the UK floods with the situation ongoing and developing all the time. Further rainfall is forecast for the coming week which could increase the threat of additional flooding and cause further damages. Then in terms of an insurance industry loss France, where severe flooding has been experienced in Brittany, and Ireland need to be considered as well.\nWe can begin to make some educated guesses about the extent of insurance industry losses from this winters storms and floods, however, by looking at what has been reported elsewhere as well as estimates from PERILS AG.\nSo far this winter PERILS AG has investigated 13 European windstorm events. We would expect both Tini and Ulla will deserve investigation, taking that number to 15. PERILS AG only reports on events which cause an insurance industry impact of over EUR 200m. So far three storms have qualified for reporting, while six have been deemed unlikely to result in that level of insured losses.\nOf the three qualifying storms, the latest insured loss estimates stand at; €1.068 billion for windstorm Christian, €680 million for windstorm Xaver and €275 million for windstorm Dirk. That’s a total of €2.023 billion just from those three storms and these numbers will all likely rise.\nIt’s reasonably safe to make an assumption that the six storms that PERILS deemed not qualifying, so unlikely to reach EUR200m, may have caused another €300m between them(€50m each), so taking our unscientific estimate of insured losses to €2.323 billion.\nThen we have another four European windstorms under investigation, including Ruth which is likely to qualify as it caused quite an impact on the UK. So maybe those four will result in another €350m of insured losses, taking the minimum qualification amount of €200m for Ruth and €50m for the other three storms. That takes our estimate of total insured losses to €2.673 billion.\nWe still have two more storms to consider, windstorms Tini and Ulla. From the damage suffered from these storms it is hard to imagine that they will not result in insured losses of €200m each, thus qualifying for reporting by PERILS. So that’s another €400m at least to add to the tally, which takes our total from the European windstorms to €3.073 billion.\nBut we haven’t taken the UK flooding into account in any of those estimates, so that is assumed to be at last another £1 billion or approximately €1.22 billion. Add that to our total insured loss estimate and it rises to €4.273 billion.\nAdd in some additional insured losses for flooding in Brittany and northern France, plus flooding in Ireland and we could easily be at a total insurance industry impact from this winters European windstorms and floods in the range of €4.5 billion to €5 billion.\nShould the UK flooding continue to worsen and the impacts get as severe as last seen in 2007 and we could add another £1 billion to £2 billion to that figure.\nAt that point these losses are really becoming meaningful for home insurers in the UK and other affected countries, with some of the loss expected to be passed on to global reinsurers as well.\nIt’s not just Europe where losses are rising\nSo while the European windstorms and flooding affecting northern Europe is beginning to look like a sizeable loss for the insurance and reinsurance industry, looking across the Atlantic at the U.S. winter storm situation shows that further losses will impact the industry there as well.\nThe combined impacts of severe winter weather to the industry could be some of the worst ever suffered. While these aren’t on the scale of losses suffered from catastrophe events such as severe hurricanes or earthquakes, they are sufficient to result in some relieving of pressure in some loss affected regions and lines of business, but perhaps more on insurance than reinsurance rates.\nCatastrophe bonds continue to look unaffected, but the amount of losses to be passed on to global reinsurers must be growing all the time and there is a strong likelihood that some impact to capital markets backed reinsurance players, such as ILS funds, could be expected if the situation continues.\nIt will be some time before the insured loss totals are known for the latest storms(both European and U.S. winter storms) and the developing flooding situation. We can expect to see an increasing amount of discussion and speculation of the eventual totals so we hope that our unscientific approach above gives you some idea of the potential impact this winters events may have.\n---PERILS increases European windstorm Tini loss estimate to €281m---\nPERILS AG, a Swiss-based provider of industry-wide European catastrophe insurance industry loss data and indices, has published its third industry-wide insured loss estimate for European windstorm Tini, raising the figure to €281m.\nEuropean windstorm Tini, also known as Darwin in some countries of Europe, impacted the UK and Ireland on 12th and 13th February 2014, with the majority of the losses occurring in those two countries.\nPERILS first estimate of industry-wide insured losses for European windstorm Tini was initially disclosed as €245m in March. PERILS then revealed a small increase to €253m, based on ultimate gross loss data as reported by primary insurance companies, in May.\nThe revised third estimate of property market insurance industry losses is a slightly larger increases to €281m(approx $375m).\nBeing the third scheduled loss estimate, the data on windstorm Tini is now available at an increased level of granularity. The market loss data is available at a higher resolution, with losses per CRESTA zone(two-digit postcode level) and per property line of business.\nThe granularity of the data now available to PERILS subscribers means that in combination with gust speed data and PERILS market sums insured, the windstorm Tini loss footprint can be used to validate European wind risk models with actual data.\nIn line with PERILS reporting schedule the fourth loss estimate for European windstorm Tini will be made available on the 12th February 2015.\nEuropean windstorm Tini map of loss estimate footprint - Source: PERILS AG\nUpdate on all European catastrophe events investigated by PERILS AG from this winter: related to Tini|Darwin,\n        first extract and summarize detailed information about the total economic loss or damage caused by Tini|Darwin, focusing specifically on the economic impact in the mentioned regions.
